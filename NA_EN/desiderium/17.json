All of it is damage and ways to apply damage tied to mobility and CC. All of it. It&#039;s impossible to nerf one part of her kit without making the rest of it terrible. \n\nHowever what we *can* do is take away unnecessary power from her. Her Distortion&#039;s hitbox is just way too wide right now. It deals damage in an AoE similar to Katarina&#039;s spin move (Sinister Blades.) That&#039;s a pretty huge PBAoE considering it&#039;s also a mobility spell that deals damage that is also able to proc *extra* damage. The hitbox needs to be normalized. It&#039;s way too outrageous right now.\n\nAnd now her chain hitbox as well. It&#039;s way too thick. It also has some kind of strange design flaw that most old skillshots have in which, if aimed diagonally across the map, they are significantly easier to hit for some odd reason (same with Lee Sin Q and a few others.) In addition to this, it also hits when you clearly move out of the way, and misses when it&#039;s supposed to hit you dead-on (SKT vs. CJ anyone?)\n\nThere&#039;s no good way to remove her power because of the way her kit is designed. However, with that said, she&#039;s not in dire need of a rework. But what we can do right now is remove this extreme reliability in her damage application via overly forgiving hitboxes.\n\nReduce Distortion AoE and Chain Hitbox and we should be okay.\n\nAlso check out the [General Discussion](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/GD/jj4t62yX-its-hard-to-nerf-leblanc-without-making-her-bad?show=flat) version of this thread.

We're doing some work on her at the moment as a result, looking at reducing some mixture of her E's width, her W's travel speed and W's AOE size (unlikely to be all of those at once though). Our goal's to make it easier to react to her casts, whether that's dodging W or E, CCing her as she comes in with W, using defensive abilities on yourself/allies as she W's in or whatever.\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"DJ Di0","date":"2015-05-10T19:58:33.719+0000","up_votes":29,"down_votes":3,"body":"I think they should lower the tether range as well.

But you're pretty much guaranteed to take flak for trying to take Dr. Mundo, Garen or Trundle mid. Cho'gath you can get away with, though. But if Leblanc has any brain at all, she won't bother trying to lane against you and go farm champions in the other lanes every chance she gets. So, that doesn't work either.\n\nAt this point, I think the best way I can deal with Leblanc is to either ban her or dodge when spotted on the enemy team and never ever play blind pick.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Dracid","date":"2015-05-11T05:35:53.542+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Kagami,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=hRl5AL3E,comment-id=000500000000000000000000,timestamp=2015-05-10T22:08:02.650+0000)\n>\n> Leblanc doesn't have clear weakness.

This also allows other midlaners to shove her in, removing her roaming potential.  This drastically cuts down on her ability to snowball.  Most of the time in lane, she will use Distortion for trades.  This means she will dash in your direction, if not directly on top of you, making it predictable and opening her up to your cc.

It was my idea actually. You can go find it if you want to see it more in-depth but basically what I said was there could be an added mana cost to her Distortion's retreat, but if she hits someone with her Distortion's first cast, the retreat would cost no mana.

One thing I think would be a fair nerf to her (and Zed) would be to limit the range at which she can port back to her distortion pad. I love when Leblancs distort in, roam around causing havoc, and then just tap w to get out of Dodge instantly. Not entirely easy to play against, and pretty hard to even CC effectively. Doesn't help that her passive is basically ALWAYS up, so killing her even if you CC her is tricky. That moment of invisibility is kind of OP, because even though you can tell which one is the real LB by clicking on them they've usually used that moment of invis to get out of the way so that killing them isn't really an option.

There's a lot of stuff about her that's pretty cool, like her deception and juking power, but in the end she's never going to be healthy if she can just keep on unloading her full burst without too much input from her target. Making her spell hitboxes less generous would make her burst more difficult to land, but at higher levels people would still ban Leblanc because players who've mastered her would still be able to land all of those spells with similar levels of reliability.\n\nAlong with the changes you mentioned, I think Leblanc could probably do with a new Q. Back when it could silence enemies, it was terrible because it removed the ability to react from her opponents, and now it's still pretty bad, since it's point-and-click damage that can double up on itself via QRQ to act as an even bigger nuke, all while still not really providing any opportunity for her target to outplay her. Despite its hitbox, Leblanc's E is a pretty good ability, since it forces her to stay close to her opponent to get the most out of it, which in turn allows them to retaliate against her or avoid some of her damage, and I think her Q should follow similar gameplay lines: if Leblanc's Q were designed to encourage more interaction between her and her opponent, whether it be via delayed damage, less reliable targeting or forced commitment (or all of those), Leblanc would likely become a lot better to deal with, and could probably also afford tons more power across her kit.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Katariken","date":"2015-05-11T00:50:05.800+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think that she needs more damage on the mark's explosion (second damage of her Q) but tons of less damages on her W (with % more damage on monsters and minions to compensate her wave clear).\nJust this.\n\n\nI really hate being detroyed by her W. \nHer E is fine, I think.\nBut W+R(W) double times it's so frustrating.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rand0mH3r0X","date":"2015-05-10T21:43:58.967+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would just prefer the tip of her chain be her hitbox.

You go the full distance, but considering how fast the dash goes and insta-port back into place, there is no counterplay unless you're really unlucky and the enemy uses a displacement when you W, thus preventing it, but then you can still W back and wait a few seconds for it to come back up.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"CISTERN","date":"2015-05-11T03:37:26.798+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"How to make lebitch balanced, lebitch cant mimic w, compensation buff for that: mimic q do full damage without need for triggering the mark.\n\nMore range dps, less mobility= zonable","replies":[{"poster":"DemiluniS","date":"2015-05-12T08:49:13.509+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Buffing her point and click?
