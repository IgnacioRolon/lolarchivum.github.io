But every Project skin since then has been released in an event.\n\nNow, I&#039;m not complaining. I think it&#039;s cool when the skins get released together.\n\nBut my question is, if there&#039;s a situation like Project Yasuo where you found that he was a good canditate for a dark cyberpunk themed skin, but didn&#039;t find a chance or desire to do so for anyone else, then could the skin be released *alone* when it is completed, like what you did with Yasuo? Or *must* the skin be part of a group of skins? \n\nThis doesn&#039;t necessarily only concern Project, but all skins and skin lines. TL;DR is there a chance in the future that we can get a Project skin that *doesn't* have to be in a group?","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-07-20T19:16:32.537+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In the case of PROJECT: Yasuo, we wanted to test the waters with something pretty different than what we'd done in the past. We didn't have any other PROJECT skins lined up at that time. \n\nWe think it's awesome to have groups of skins so players can feel cool when they load in with matching skins. PROJECT skins (or other thematics of skins) don't have to be released in groups, and since there is a fair amount of them now, it's possible we could release another one alone. Hard to say, though, as we just released a batch of them and don't have anything else in the works for PROJECT right now.","replies":[{"poster":"Gora T","date":"2016-07-20T19:21:57.973+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Katey! \nI was wondering (and about to make a thread) why did you guys removed the drone in Ashe's recall?","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-07-20T19:31:12.732+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hiya! \n\nWe felt the  drone was a bit awkward.
