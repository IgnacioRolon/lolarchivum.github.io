Slightly more AD for early on, slightly more pen to stay slightly more relevant in the late game.\n\nMagus: New unique passive: Refunds a percentage of mana from a percentage of damage you deal with your spells. Gives mages a version of Essence Reaver that is actually not underpowered.\n\nDevourer: +8% lifesteal. Gives very slight jungle staying power in the early game, and stacks with other sources of lifesteal in the lategame. Note that the lifesteal doesn&#039;t work with the magic damage on auto attacks.\n\nCinderhulk: Reduced to 20% health bonus from 25%. Now gives 250 health instead of 300. Whenever you are hit by a single target spell or basic attack, gain a brief movement speed boost.\n\nWhat do you guys think about these changes?","replies":[{"poster":"Partholonian","date":"2015-05-19T02:47:02.196+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Warrior: 50 AD up from 40. 15 armor pen up from 10. Slightly more AD for early on, slightly more pen to stay slightly more relevant in the late game.\n\nFlat pen is most effective early (and against squishies).  That's why Brutalizer is a frequently rushed item (in general, not just as a component of Warrior).\n\nAlso, this buff is too big.  10 AD is not \"slight\", it's a long sword, which costs 360 gold.  Counting the arpen, you're proposing ~500 gold worth of buffs to an item that was the dominant meta only a few patches ago.\n\nFor magus, I kind of like it, but maybe it should be vs. monsters only (and include smite damage).  Less blue dependence is nice, but it shouldn't let you siege eternally.\n\nDevourer, IDK what to do with.  Is it just an accident that the autoattacker item is also the farming stacks item, or is that intentional based on something about certain champions?\n\nMaybe the stack farming needs to go away in favor of a power spike that is similar to the other paths.  \"Hey guys, I finished my jungle item, now avoid fighting for 10 more min while I stack it\" is not going to make a jungler popular with his team (this was one of the problems with feral flare and probably why devourer is so weak today).\n\nOr maybe *all* jungle enchants should have some on-buy power and some stacking power -- e.g. Cinderhulk starting at 10% health and ramping up based on mob kills, Magus giving AP per mob kill on top of a baseline (I think it used to do this at one point) and Warrior, IDK, AD seems pretty OP considering the kind of AD casters that tend to build it, but maybe with the right amount of AD gained per camp relative to the others it could work.\n\nJunglers get less gold than laners (except supports), so they're always going to struggle to stay competitive based on buying normal items with gold, but one thing they do get more of than anyone else is monster kills, so making *all* jungle-oriented items scale with monster kills could give them late-game relevance without making the items easily poachable (even a laner that takes Smite won't spend enough time farming monsters to get their item to high stacks, or they're not a laner anymore).\n\nThis system could make Poacher more attractive.  If you know up front, as a basic fact of jungling, that both you and the enemy jungler are going to scale with large monsters killed in a way that is relevant to each of your respective classes, then taking his large monsters makes you stronger and him weaker in a way that goes beyond the gold lost.\n\nOn the downside, though, this would intensify the rage-inducing-ness of having your teammates counterjungle you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2015-05-19T10:31:42.305+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cinderhulk is fine now\n\nDevourer and Magus simply need buffs","replies":[]},{"poster":"Erockandroll","date":"2015-05-19T19:23:52.181+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"A couple of Counter offers.\n\nCinderhulk: is actually fine where it is. Particularly because they got rid of the offensive power that made it a step above everything else. If it'd defenses should be nerfed, it should be more so in the early game. Tank Junglers should have better late game scaling to make up for their weak early clears. \n\nWarrior: I disagree with how much power you put on Warrior, That would make it more powerful than it was on release. Warrior should maintain it's power as an Early game item. Perhaps more Armor pen as use suggested, but not the AD boost. It should still clear camps faster still than Tank Junglers with CinderHulk.\n\nMagus: I'm unsure about this one. Their are too few Mage Junglers, potentially with different styles of play, so I don't know what they really need. A lot of people say Mana Regen, Even though their a fair amount on the Jungler passive, and you still have blue buff as well as smite bonuses. I wouldn't give it a direct regen buff, however, think of the unholy grail passive \"restores 30% mana on Kill or assist.\" This could reward AP Junglers as they could continue to Jungle as they pull off successful ganks. \n\nDevourer: Even less sure about this one. It's obviously a late game item, but is meant for assassins, or AS Bruisers? can we balance around both? The one thing I would change however is making the stacking damage bonus less reliant on Power farming (which riot discourages) Perhaps basing the increase of bonus damage on a conservation stacks mechanic. \n\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Inept Maverick,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=B5RcE0oA,comment-id=000c,timestamp=2015-05-18T23:53:16.675+0000)\n>\n> What's up with the 9 deleted posts?\n\nOP thinks he's shamelessly bumping his post to gain visibility.

If Riot wanted this to be the norm they never would have changed the items in the first place. Not to mention, Nidalee and Fiddlesticks both have pretty good win rates and pick rates right now. If you want to buff Magus because you think Diana and Elise need the help, well...you kind of can't because Fiddle and Nidalee are oppressive.\n\nCinderhulk changes: You can't lower the flat health Cinderhulk gives. Bami's Cinder, which is a component that builds into Cinderhulk, gives 300 health. Upgrading an item and losing stats from the upgrade is something Riot has only done once (with some item they have since deleted from the game. I can't remember, I think it was a Philo's stone upgrade). Needless to say, it's not normal balancing style, so don't do it. Additionally, giving tanks free uncounterable move speed every time they're hit by an auto would be toxic. It would completely remove the ability of marksmen to kite. It's just like how Randuin's Omen used to slow ms if you attacked the wielder, only in reverse. There's no way these changes would be balanced.\n\nDevourer: I agree entirely here. Some form of lifesteal on Devourer is really what it needs to help keep the auto based champs in their desired order.\n\nSo how would I fix them? Let's see here:\n\nWarrior - No changes needed. Warrior is an early game item that is used by champions who have largely enough damage in their kits and rely on snowballing against champions who, thanks to their level, don't have a lot of health. It shouldn't scale well into late game because it helps you earn gold faster if you use it right.\n\nMagus - Giving this item mana regen would make it more attractive on mid laners in the same way Cinderhulk spread to top lane. To avoid that, here's my solution: While in combat with large or epic monsters, you emit a pulse of energy that deals 15+2xlevel magic damage every 3 seconds. This deals 100% bonus damage to monsters. This way Magus champs can clear without using so much of their mana, and in a way that isn't reliant on their auto attack speed.\n\nCinderhulk - If this item continues to be a problem, I propose the following solution:\nImmolate Aura - Deals 40 magic damage per second to monsters only\nNEW - BATHE IN FLAMES - Active component: Create an aura that deals 1% of your total health as magic damage to all nearby enemies each second. The aura lasts 10 seconds. Cooldown: 120 seconds.\n\nThere, now the tanks can only do damage in short, very communicated bursts, and still get to keep their clear times.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Loveless","date":"2015-05-19T20:08:01.669+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think spell vamp is more helpful to ap junglers.

Essentially it softens the weaknesses that tanks are intended to have (early game) and improves their strengths at the same time (soaking damage in the late game). \n\nThe solution would be either it gives a stronger early game and we move % Bonus HP to another item, or it gives the % bonus HP and we lower the base HP on it further.

I feel like the flat health could go as low as 150-200 and the item would be pretty well balanced.\n\nThe movement speed bonus on getting hit by an auto attack or single target spell is bad game design for a tank. Tanks have the job to make the enemy team's carries focus them, and this change gives the enemy team's carries strong incentives to not attack them.\n\nCinderhulk would probably be balanced if it just gave less health than than it currently does, if it need nerfs at all. Which it probably does need.\n\nI'm not sure if Lifesteal solves problems that **Devourer **has. Devourer has some big problems where:\n\n1. The jungler has to rush it over other items that may provide bigger powerspikes in the early-mid game\n2. The jungler is forced to powerfarm the jungle in order to get good results out of Devourer\n\nAny changes to Devourer should be geared towards solving at least one of these two problems so that it can be utilized in the on-hit builds it was designed for.\n\nAlso, lifesteal doesn't solve sustain problems for every jungler that takes it because not every jungler buys AD. Some build tank after Devourer, other build AD, and some weird souls build Devourer into AP items (I don't blame them considering how bad Magus is), and lifesteal doesn't help all of their problems. It would probably be better to have a flat heal tacked onto their autos instead if the item got any sort of healing component, but lifesteal isn't really that important.\n\n**Magus **is in a really bad spot, and if I hadn't done any experimenting of my own with AP junglers, I would say that this is a pretty good solution. However, I did some weird experimenting with the jungle in custom games with some of the AP champions that I owned that aren't really meta junglers. I hadn't tested every single AP champion in the entire game (I don't own all of the AP champions in the entire game, nor did I try any AP champions that would either be unable to clear the jungle without the items or that are already known for being meta AP junglers), but what I found would suggest that these changes wouldn't really help every single AP jungler the way we would need it to.\n\nWhat I found is that junglers either had severe mana problems or had severe health problems. They might have minor problems with the other resource, but it's generally the severe resource problem that holds these junglers back.\n\nMana sustain on the mage jungle item really helps those with severe mana problems, but it doesn't do anything for those with severe health problems. Magus' CDR and AP might help those with severe health problems, as I didn't actually build it in my experiments, but I didn't really feel it was strong enough to actually be useful for that purpose on most of the junglers I experimented with, and would result in greater mana problems, although to be fair I should have tried it in my experiments anyways to see how it worked.\n\nMana sustain would, at the very least, be really useful on the item as a whole, but on spell damage might favor champions with lower cooldowns too much more than those with higher cooldowns would be. I'm thinking maybe something more like a burn effect that occurs on dealing spell damage that restores the users mana per tick? That would probably make it's mana restore a lot more equal for a larger variety of champions, especially for those that use burstier, higher-cooldown rotations or that stagger their spell usage a bit, and would overall offer a lot greater amount of mana restoration for a larger variety of champions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Imotekh Kharn","date":"2015-05-19T01:38:05.492+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree Cinderhulk fits the Tank niche way better then Warrior fits the assassin niche or magus in the Ap whatever niche.","replies":[]},{"poster":"agbudar","date":"2015-05-19T00:44:34.772+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"first of kha is weak so him taking cinderhulk to stay relevant is not an issue with cinder but kha\ni still take warrior over cinder with someone like yi jungle and it doesnt make me feel like i gimp myself.\n\nif a jungler did not do at least half \"ap\" damage as the midlaner with a cinderhulk then what was that jungler doing? dancing in river?\ni mean its a constant source of damage against all minions ofc the damage is gonna ramp up.\njungler always does most or 2nd most damage due to the inherent role.\n\nif cinderhulk is op and you still dont see half the junglers like shyvana or rammus show up but all the other ones like udyr and whatnot then maybe its time to face the fact that most of these tanky champs got overnerfed (and ofc im not talking about seji she is right where she should be atm just that as a tank she outshines every other tank with her awesome clears/CC/objective control)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Extreme Troller","date":"2015-05-18T23:12:17.249+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"i think the 20% damage reduction make non sense.
