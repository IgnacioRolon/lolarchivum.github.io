A lot of players wanted to play ranked with friends but that was impossible unless you had only 1 friend or exactly 4 friends to play with.  Ranked 5s rankings were pretty shit in my experience because teams would be so imbalanced 90% of the time, since your solo ranking didn't matter for that.  Riot is trying to make things in ranked better, going back to the old system just undoes any sort of improvement they've made this past year and putting all 3 queues together would make the ranking system very confusing because most of the time dynamic is pretty similar to old solo queue, but now you couldn't rank them the same way.

Dynamic Q is literally the stupidest thing I've seen a dev do to a multiplayer game of this size, it has completely changed the experience and more often than not it's just frustrating. I'm going to refer to WoW again, the Cataclysm expansion was the turning point -- when competitive players stopped caring. I already see that trend now. League's hey day is all but over especially at this rate","replies":[]},{"poster":"Soraka Rules","date":"2016-06-05T02:37:44.901+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"I've been playing this game since S1 and my answer is: I don't know, I don't care, and its still fun :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"John 13 34","date":"2016-06-05T12:08:09.800+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> It's like a son getting killed by his father instead of by a wild animal.\n\nOf all the ways to describe it I'm kind of concerned that you settled on this as the most appropriate analogy...","replies":[]},{"poster":"ShinobisDemon","date":"2016-06-05T10:54:47.228+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":3,"body":"https://playoverwatch.com/\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[{"poster":"Jorencice","date":"2016-06-05T11:33:58.438+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"Eh.

Because the only thing separating you from a 5 year old is sticking your tongue out and yelling \"Nyeh nyeh!\" in my face.\n\nBoth you and the OP are in the same position, 'cept OP was far more tactful about it. You stood up in the middle of a vegan restaurant and announced that you love bacon. Fine that's your opinion and that's what you like, except nobody really cares and you're more than likely to get a few people telling you to go enjoy bacon elsewhere that you love enough you felt the need to announce it to a room of strangers.\n\nAlso TF2 =/= Overwatch.
