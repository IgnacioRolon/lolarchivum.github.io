Sure, people can argue that he&#039;s squishy, but lets see you kill a yi with bloodrazor, bloodthirster, BoRK, GA, Berserkers Greaves, and Phantom Dancer. Not to mention hes a 450 champ so for that price you are buying one of the most simple and most op champs in the game","replies":[{"poster":"inhumanlol","date":"2016-10-31T15:23:38.091+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let any champ farm and wait for them to kill you.

He is completely useless, what he needs is buffs and a full rework.\nThe problem with yi is that bad players dont know how to handle him, so buffing him to a point of being good enough to actually play makes bronze Vs cry.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Malachi Zeno","date":"2016-10-27T20:58:20.653+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly, saying we should nerf yi is like saying we should nerf kat, the rework to her is gonna make her take some skill to play, or at least a little bit a thought, shes not as braindead as she used to be thats for sure, hes already been changed a number of times and hes in a pretty good spot where he isn't to op or to weak.","replies":[]}]}
