I woke up this morning confident to get to Silver 4 as it would only be 3 wins. I win the first 2 games, one easier than the other, and now my promos start. I have a free win and its looking easy as hell. Nope. Get this, I get paired with 10 if the worst players Ive ever seen in this game ever, this is not an understatement. They ruined every game, be it the wonder twin bot lane who started flaming, or the 1-8 Aurelion who ran it down mid all game, or even better, the jungle riven who insisted to &quot;trust&quot; and then proceeds to go 2-10. Theres no way to carry this garbage, so what is there that I can do? What champions can i play that can carry by themselves and what are some ways to avoid trolls and overrall bad players? Im now sitting at a miserable 8 Lp all because of the mongoloids Ive had to deal with.","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2016-09-18T05:23:16.426+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The key to winning these kinds of games in my opinion is to try to snowball as much gold as you can onto your sucky teammates.\n\nDont say anything that can be misconstrued as negative. Every chance you have to gank, do it. Never hit their minions. Be quick to lead with pings, such as to take an objective or run from a champ.\n\nDo this as quickly as possible. By the first five minutes you should have identified who needs this and which opponents to target, by 6 or 7 you should have at least made them b.\n\nDoing this will help keep your teammate from tilting and performing worse and hopefully tilt your opponent, and give your team a gold advantage. The best way to solo carry a game is as a team.\n\nPlaying as mid or jungle lets you do this best but its possible from any lane.","replies":[]}]}
