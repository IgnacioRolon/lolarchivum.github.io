I own a Medion gaming laptop and he owns a Macbook pro. We both use the exact same internet connection, and have a very good internet package with vodafone. We have taken your advice on contacting our network provider and they have assured us that this recurring issue is nothing to do with them. This is nothing to do with the network provider, and I am not the first one to say so. Every comment from one of your employees regarding this issue repeatedly and incorrectly states that this issue is a fault on our end, and not your company's. \r\nCan you please take responsibility as a multi-million dollar co-operation and fix this issue on your end as it is getting to the point where you will likely lose a large proportion of your mac gaming group.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response.\r\n\r\nWill","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-19T15:57:06.222+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey sorry for all the trouble you're going through, and I do want to make it clear that I have no problems letting you guys know if our servers are acting up.  Accountability is important, there's no reason for me to hide any issues that would just cause you pain.   I don't have a lot of visibility of EU issues, but I'm not seeing anything out of the ordinary.  Your ISP might be okay as well as our servers, but you can still have local blocks or settings that's struggling to reach us.  Your ISP can also still have issues routing to specific services like the game server.  \n\nSo, let's get on equal footing by getting an analysis of what's really happening.  Firstly, run through the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to make sure that any local snags are cleared.\n\nThen download [WinMTR](http://winmtr.net/winmtr-v0-92-now-available/) and route it to 192.64.170.252, which is the EUW game server.  Run it for about 5 minutes, remove the IP on the first 2 hops to keep it secure, and let me know what you find.","replies":[]}]}
