When you just make an account you should at least play the game on it once right? \r\n\r\nlv.5 1.5 years of inactivity some people made these account's I believe to just get the old referral bonus at the minimum level ( correct me if the level is wrong ) \r\n\r\nlv.30 Same as it should, someone put the time to bring it up there for one reason or another so the current system is fair\r\n\r\nIn all honesty I'm not completely sure how the current system works but it should hopefully be something like \r\n> Get an email 1-2 months before you name becomes inactive\r\n> Still be able to hold the name as long as no one wants it\r\n\r\nHere I'll put my thoughts and a small little discussion on the matter as a whole or situations that can occur  \r\n\r\nWhat if someone wants to play again on their account that didn't really like the game the first time they played? \r\n \r\nWell a simple email should suffice letting them know, the amount of time they played is also pretty small for the lower levels and can be made up easily too \r\n\r\nBasically I think some people really would like to have a name for themselves and they just don't get the chance because others take it and even use it to make money (selling an IGN) which really shouldn't be happening much ( for the people that don't use the account for themselves at least, it's a bit more reasonable for the people wanting an account of an active player that you can say earned the name)\r\n\r\nThe main reason I've brought this up is for champion based IGN's which are very popular obviously and maybe champion IGN's themselves should have a lower time until they're considered inactive since they're wanted so badly ( maybe 2-2.5 years )\r\n\r\nwell that is all thanks for reading over this and my extreme apologies if this isn't where it should be/ something is weird or wrong since i've never used this place and i'm new to it all","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-06-06T22:15:45.992+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The current automatic inactive name clean up is as follows;\n\n* 1 month of name protection per level\n * This means a level 20 has 20 months of protection and a 30 has 30 months.\n* 6 month minimum\n * A level 1-6 will have 6 months of protection, and a level 7 will have 7 months.\n\nThere is no email notification for your name becoming inactive (that would only enforce the issues you're seeing, really) but otherwise the current system is even more harsh than the one you propose.
