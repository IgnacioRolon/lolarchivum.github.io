I am having in-game issues with my chat interface. First, I am unable to open a chat message using my 'enter' key even though i am both able to chat in queue and able to see others' chat in game. I have not received any chat restrictions on my account from Riot. I am also having an issue where when i press 'G' or 'V' to ping alert other players, my ping cursor is dragged well off the screen and has very slow response for me to make any ping other than \"On My Way.\" This is disruptive when I want to ask for assistance or caution other players. The issue began today when I attempted to make a remark in /all chat and was unable to use the enter key to send my message. I have since been unable to start a chat message in game and my pings have been slow. I have unistalled/reinstalled my LoL application as well have attempted resetting keybindings to see if those methods would fix the issue, but they did not. Any help would be appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-07-06T23:57:44.911+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you running Windows 10 and a VOIP (Skype, Discord, etc) when you play?

I didn't realize the issue could be related with my use of discord. Although i wasn't using discord at the time my computer ran it in the background. I activated an invisible interface when I unknowingly used my hotkey to open the interface \"Shift+M.\" When it happened to me in a second game, I simply hit \"Shift+M\" again and I could chat.{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"cryptonite17","date":"2016-07-09T16:26:11.508+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This \"bug,\" if you can call it that,  is actually able to occur regardless of windows version as I used windows 8 when it happened.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
