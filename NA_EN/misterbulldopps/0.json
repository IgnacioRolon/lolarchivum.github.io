We will continue to monitor the situation to ensure that everything is working correctly.\n\n> 44 minutes ago\n> RiotMasterCheese — We're aware of problems related to logging into the NA platform and are working with our partner on getting these resolved. Earlier today we experienced issues with a major national backbone provider, causing many players to experience connection issues to our platform. We're also checking the health of our own infrastructure, but at this moment we believe the issue is related to the provider's infrastructure.\n\n\nLooks like it should've been fixed as of a few seconds ago - might be worth trying to get your game on! :-)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dachs II","date":"2014-12-04T16:53:36.148+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Would like to see some news about these issues being resolved.","replies":[]},{"poster":"EPV","date":"2014-12-04T14:33:44.599+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same problem...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Acidie","date":"2015-02-09T23:20:03.776+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have the same problem, I keep logging on and getting connection error.

Rito wants to make sure we dont spend time in game now that they just opened their merch store and would rather have us shopping in the mean time?
