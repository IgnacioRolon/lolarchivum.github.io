The reason this shit works is just taking two champs that can 2v2 extremely well and having the actual laner buy a supp item so the snowbally jungler gets fed off farm.

At all.\nTake a 2s stun on ulting jax, or mundo, or whatever tank, jugg or tanky bruiser it's like whatever, on Yi you're basically dead.\n\nIf he ults away grats, he's useless for like one minute and a half. Since nerfs Yi's ult cd is really long, and Yi literally can't fight at all, let alone gank, without ult. Also ulting away is pretty much weaker than most escapes in the game, Yi isn't even good at escaping.\n\nAnd if he can duel well and multikill that's basically the only thing the champion does. Remove that, what do you have left? A squishy champ with no utility whatsoever, no damage, no nothing?

Statistics show that if Yi gets to 3 complete items, his win rate soars to 60%+ on almost every conceivable build. Even at high elo where they know to apply pressure, Yi's pulling close to a 50% win rate right now, because it's just so hard to keep him from 3 items.\n\nImo, that's a design flaw if a specific item threshold gives that much power. If the entire theme of the champion is.... you have to invade him and shut down his ability to farm for the entire game..... That's not a skill based champ matchup. That's an OP champ that's only weakness is not being allowed to play the game.\n\nRemember the old Warwick? That's where he was. Delay his level 6, or he had point and click suppression you couldn't dodge, which shifted him into 15/0 games. Your entire goal was to shut him down before he got there. If you didn't, he was OP. That's why he got reworked. To give more options to avoid his kit in exchange for more power when he's successful.\n\nGuinsoo's just changed Yi's identity. On a Good Yi, it's almost impossible to CC him, because he saves his Q for when a CC is incoming. Q's to force the skill to be wasted/do no damage/cc, and then kills the caster, and the auto attack after the Q has Guinsoo's at full stacks, so his passive will activate twice as often, making it so every other hit refreshes Q. He spends so much time in the air now.... it's hard to CC a good Yi. And if he manages to get an Essence Reaver, Q resets even faster. I've seen a video of Pants Are Dragon literally staying airborne for the entire 8 seconds of the Essence Reaver getting a solo Quad kill. During the 8 seconds he was maybe on the ground for 1 whole second of it.\n\nIf Yi Blows his Q on an engage without thinking about CC..... that's the only time he really dies now. Or you invade and shut down his jungle for the first 10 minutes. That's your only two options. Your lane farm be damned. Your snowballing bot/top farming be damned.

Learn to browse through the sites before you comment. \n\nAnd of-course there are going to be lower number of people for Yi stats in high elo, because there are lower number of high elo people in general, on top of that them playing a non-OP champion like Yi means a troll pick or auto-loss pick, so yes you would have low amount of data because the champion is not for that elo.

In the case of a champion like Yi, he has a ton of power tied to his autoattacks, but what gameplay does that bring? Perhaps if he took time to take his targets down, the gameplay would come down to surviving long enough to kill his opponents, but that's not possible, because Yi's tools don't let him survive that long. As it stands, currently his power comes from killing enemies far too quickly, so there isn't really the most gameplay there. There are many more reasons behind this, namely that there's so much damage, CC and general anti-melee stuff in this game that it's basically impossible to make a squishy melee damage-dealer both functional and fair at the same time, but in general Riot still has a problem with designing autoattack-based champions as just champions with a ton of damage on each autoattack.\n\nPersonally, I think autoattacking power should come from fulfilling certain conditions and playing skillfully, not simply from pressing a button to gain access to ultra-reliable steroids. This is ultimately the problem with Yi, because his attack speed and true damage on his kit are both entirely on-demand. On the flipside, he suffers when he doesn't burst enemies down, because his Q and W aren't actually that good at protecting him against incoming threats. Personally, I'd support removing the reliability out of his damage steroids completely, and instead only rewarding him with more offensive power if he uses his defenses at the right time, with perhaps buffs to those effects to make them better at defending him over a longer period of time. Yi imo should be a champion about very precise timing and quick decision-making, so he should be rewarded for dodging and blocking key abilities with powerful counter-strikes, yet right now he just presses all of his buttons and stat-checks his opponents to death.\n\nThe **TL;DR** here is that Yi needs to be more skill expressive and less about blowing all of his steroids to right-click opponents to death, which isn't a novel concept, but I think there needs to be an emphasis on better persistent defenses, in exchange for less to no on-demand fighting power, and much more skill-dependent steroids instead.","replies":[{"poster":"SanKakU","date":"2018-06-08T15:38:46.429+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why can't we merge Yi and Fiora? She's got that annoying parrying ability of hers, and maybe we could introduce some weird sword champ that heals allies by attacking them, like the Tenseiga from the anime Inuyasha.","replies":[{"poster":"Amoc","date":"2018-06-08T18:01:57.230+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fiora is an example of something functioning properly.  Fiora's parry is a high-skill anticipatory defensive that punishes her if she miss-times it.  Yi's ult makes him completely immune to slows and cripples, so the only thing that can stop him is hard cc.  His alpha-strike provides a ton of constant cc and damage avoidance, and if he's not CC'd he has pretty much literally the most broken damage in the game.  You can't tank his damage.  You can't out-damage him.  After a couple of items it's hard-cc or die.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Unstoppable Monk","date":"2018-06-08T18:00:23.989+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright, first of all it's not a skill thing so much as a team composition.\n\nA {{champion:11}} can counter a team of people who go all carry all damage only kits as he can out sustain-dps them being the stronger carry. \n\n{{champion:11}} has skills to dodge AP skillshot carries with the ability to chase down vulnerable enemies.
