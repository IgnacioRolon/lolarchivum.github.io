Oracles is 100% needed or Teemo just autowins ARAM. _**Even with Oracles**_ he has a 60% winrate in ARAM. Sorry you can shroom up the entire map with absolutely zero counterplay and chunk people for half their HP per shroom with no effort at all in the mode where the map is tiny and you cant base to heal. His shrooms are still extremely effective but you actually have to be smart about how you use them","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rouxful","date":"2018-06-05T17:48:30.030+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"You realize that teemo is broken without that item?
