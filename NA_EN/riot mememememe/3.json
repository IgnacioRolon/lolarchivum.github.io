NoopMoney and Riot MEMEMEMEME here to talk about turning changes that are up for testing in the 7.6 PBE cycle.\r\n\r\nWe recently discovered that champion positions on your client can get very, _very_  slightly out of sync from League&rsquo;s servers when champions make wide turns (such as turning to face the opposite direction). We&rsquo;re making some changes to make the client and server more _NSync_ than before. Don&rsquo;t worry, neither of them want to start a solo career. Overall this shouldn&rsquo;t be a noticeable change, but we&rsquo;re giving everyone the heads up just in case. (We are not adding/increasing turn speeds.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us know if anything feels significantly off!","replies":[{"poster":"Malicious Metal","date":"2017-03-14T00:50:44.818+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"My kindest regards to Riot MEMEMEMEME, heard you're actually trying to tackle Morde's Bugs.","replies":[{"poster":"Mordepool","date":"2017-03-14T01:26:24.156+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Malicious Metal,realm=EUW,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=XwzplsHI,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2017-03-14T00:50:44.818+0000)\n>\n> My kindest regards to Riot MEMEMEMEME, heard you&#x27;re actually trying to tackle Morde&#x27;s Bugs.\n\nThat probably got shelved.
