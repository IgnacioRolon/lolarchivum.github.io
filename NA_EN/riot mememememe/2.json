During ideation we got a ton of interesting concepts and I latched onto one really quickly, I kept giving feedback around why I liked it, whenever we deviated from that concept I would bring it up and start a conversation around it. Eventually The Bravo Ray took over concept work on him, and since we had a reputation already from working on Warwick I started picking his brain on the resistance to my ideas. He explained to me the difference in making something for players, and making something for myself which became a huge growth point. The core of the idea being, sometimes as Devs we can let our own personal bias take over, and fight to make the thing we want, but the thing we want is not the thing League of Legends needs. \n\nBack to the meat of your question often resolutions can happen in many different ways:\n\n*  People talk it out and explain the problem they are having, sometimes the problem isn't really an issue and everything is resolved by the conversation. Sometimes the problem just isn't understood by the other individual, and a conversation provides the context they need to get it. \n\n* Talking through craft, what I mean by that is if you have an issue with VFX, Texture, Code, ect use the language of your craft to explain what your feedback/issue is. Character Artists, VFX, Concept, ect will often do paint overs of WIP to convey issues they are having, this is often far more effective than just using words. \n\n* Talking to you guys! There are times where the pod is 50/50 on an issue but it isn't super clear what the true problem is. So we conduct player labs every 4-7 weeks of development on a champ to validate our concerns. One the player lab happens we often know what needs to be done from there, so we all work on making it happen. \n\nI know I went on a tangent a bit, lemme know if that answered your question!","replies":[{"poster":"Carnicore","date":"2017-12-20T03:54:39.647+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can I ask what mechanic you were pushing that didn't make it into the final Urgot design?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot MEMEMEMEME","date":"2017-12-20T04:07:44.221+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Was concept art, nothing to do with the game design.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Akali Best Waifu","date":"2017-12-20T01:15:16.564+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Riot MEMEMEMEME!\n\nMy question is about Akalis VGU.

Champ doesn't feel complete to me when they're left still not completely up to the game/skin standard you guys set. I feel it is in the same fashion as when you made the great decision to update all of the champ's splash arts with every VGU.\n\n- Suggestion: For Pantheon's VGU (Whom I eagerly await everyday) You have his helmet completely cover, like Saber of Red in Fate: Apocrypha, and have a toggle for it to disassemble.

That said we will delay putting people on a project if we don't feel the one of those three is not hitting the mark, so that we do not waste dev work. To answer your TLDR: a fair amount, if you look over a good chunk of the VGUs done, many of them are some of the least play/outdated champs.","replies":[]}]}]}
