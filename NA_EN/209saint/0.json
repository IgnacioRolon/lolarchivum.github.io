I repaired my client and updated my software but now I am stuck with the grueling wait to enter the game. Is there anyway I can have this taken off or removed. I did not intentionally leave the last three games. If it is out of reach to fix then I understand but if there is a way to remove it please someone let me know.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-26T21:09:17.964+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately, [Leaverbuster](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ) penalties cannot be removed. This is because regardless of the reason the disconnection happens, it negatively impacts everyone in the match. This is a key reason why the system treats all disconnections equally and why we don't modify penalties.\n\nLet me know a bit more details regarding the crashing so we can work to resolve that together.","replies":[]}]}
