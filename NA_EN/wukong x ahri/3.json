Lonelyness becomes solitude and peace. You start to care about whats best for you and ignore society. Suddenly you have way more time and money to do with as you please and suddenly women notice you for what you could do for them. Then you ignore them.","replies":[{"poster":"Mig89","date":"2018-05-25T20:05:18.930+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Jesus, MGTOW sounds like a way of life thats literally common sense.

You ignore them because you no longer need to become disposable utility. When you are aware of gynocentrism, it becomes  easy to do.  Your entire life, time, money, and resources continues to be completely yours to do as you see fit. You dont need to buy a ten thousand dollar rock to prove your worth or cancel plans for the \"Honey Do\" this. You can play league when you want without an upset partner pulling the plug because you are not focused entirely on her wants.\n\nAdded benfits: No divorce rape, child support, cheating, or false accusations. Those things can leave you suicidal. Sure people will tell you to man up, but you wont care because your life is awesome and theirs sucks.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"King of Demons","date":"2018-05-19T23:04:51.740+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Cute.
