For bad players, the Tier 9/10 MTs had slightly bouncy armour, which helps. LTs were only average, with the Franch and American LTs being much better. I don't really know about the TDs and SPGs, since I never really played them.","replies":[{"poster":"SlntReaper","date":"2016-09-17T14:42:45.334+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The German TDs were pretty good.
