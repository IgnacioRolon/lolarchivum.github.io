I played against her today and i played as kindred. she outfarmed me and i was level 9 and she was level 11. she used her Q then she stunned me. there is no way a level 9 kindred has a higher health percentage than a level 11 irelia. So i should be slowed not stunned. and i was stunned because i was not able to use any of my abilites. This is serious issues and it needs to be looked into. ive included a copy of the skill so it can be looked into ( \r\n\r\nIrelia&#039;s attack balances the scales, dealing damage and slowing the target. However, if the target has a higher Health % than Irelia, then the blow stuns the target instead of slowing.\r\n\r\nIrelia pierces her target, dealing 80/120/160/200/240 (+50% Ability Power) magic damage and slowing them by 60% for 1/1.25/1.5/1.75/2 second(s).If the target has a higher Health % than Irelia, she stuns them for the duration instead.","replies":[{"poster":"JustMonika13","date":"2016-10-17T13:31:42.949+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It also stuns those at the same health percentage by the way. If both are at 90% health, the target is stunned, and so forth.\n\nI've seen people complain about this but considering the slight hate there is for her (basically for anyone that isn't a mage and not being played at worlds) on the Boards, I've ignored it. Video evidence would be nice.","replies":[{"poster":"Black Hayate","date":"2016-10-17T15:01:31.904+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"See this is something that i alot of people have noticed.. i mean i dont hate playing against the champ, there are times based on the situation i can outrade her but what ive been experiencing is not fair. Sure i would love to record some ingame footgae next time im playing against her. however im not sure what app i can use to do so..","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"55976771DEL2","date":"2016-10-16T16:52:24.381+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If Irelia has 1700 health from 2000, and for example Riven has 1600 from 2200 Riven will be stunned because of percent health.","replies":[{"poster":"Black Hayate","date":"2016-10-17T03:23:18.740+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"right which is understandable.. Riven has a higher health percentage... However that is not the case. What im saying is that its not working like this..Look at this way, should a lower level riven (eg lvl 9) have a higher health percent than a higher level irelia (eg lvl 11) unless that riven is running tank stats and has a tank build. and my friend that day i played kindred i was level 9 and she was level 11, she Q'd me and autoed brought my health to half, then she used E and i was stunned instead of slowed. thats been happening alot. Riot needs to test this out for themselves","replies":[{"poster":"55976771DEL2","date":"2016-10-17T13:27:37.346+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is a bug with Q also because of reset thing, but for E it may be buggy or she lost too many health while you were defending yourself.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Requiemsfire","date":"2016-10-16T17:00:56.439+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Now I've seen a lot of people complaining about this but can someone actually post a video of this happening?

Possibly something like ignoring bonus HP, so the target could have, say current hp =  140% of their max HP as far as the calculation cares. \n\nChances are riot is aware and is not fixing it because it would break irelia.","replies":[{"poster":"Black Hayate","date":"2016-10-15T22:09:25.059+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i would think that a higher health percentage would mean that if we wittle down her health and shes low, she gets the ability to stun. thats my understanding of it. tied with her level of damage that seems fair. but its not fair to see a full health irelia stunning someone at 50% health.  Today i got so fed up i decided that i had to report this riot immediately.","replies":[]}]}]}
