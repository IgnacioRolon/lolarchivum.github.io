This freezing has been known to happen to some players after updating Windows 10.  Specifically, the [Xbox Game Bar](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html) seems to auto-enable, which can cause this.  Disabling it should fix this up, but it's really important you test that in a custom game.","replies":[{"poster":"SPYROSTITAN","date":"2017-08-05T22:14:35.448+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can GeForce cause this problem ??","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-08-05T22:32:13.337+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The brand specifically?
