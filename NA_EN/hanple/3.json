In response they apologized and made it a company wide mission to address these issues by open up diversity and inclusion departments in their company. Now here's why the community is mad. In a recent event, PAX Riot decided to ban men from the event by limiting their access to after 2:30. Their Justification for is that they believe that for women and non-binary people to be given opportunities they must exclude men and give them special treatment. seems pretty wrong and hypocritical right?","replies":[{"poster":"Hanple","date":"2018-09-03T18:54:26.135+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Mmm, now I get it.

For example, the /rengarmains subreddit pretty much launched a full scale invasion a year or two ago over reverting him back to his old kit. Every single top rated gameplay post was by someone with a rengar-related name and every single one was calling for rengar to be reverted. Whenever someone playing off-meta gets banned \"unjustly\" or whatever and a bunch of youtubers make clickbait videos about it, we get a flood of people asking for them to be unbanned. \n\nMy guess is that since riot made some choices that angered a lot of people who think a specific way, they all wanted to express their anger through the official forums. That resulted in the normal posts getting drowned out.","replies":[]}]}
