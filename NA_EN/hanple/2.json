That's called tyranny. The Noxians are power-hungry primates given speech. They're basically the orcs of League. They don't care about anything but jacked up testosterone and fucked up brutality. They aren't low on any resources and they have a relatively well-trained military, while being one of the largest nations in Runeterra. What the fuck are they surviving against when noone knows about supernatural threats like Aurelion or the Void other than a few people?\n\nAnd if you're going to tell me that Noxus will just let you peacefully live under their forceful rule as they destroy you homes, family, loved ones, culture and burn your lands to the ground then you've clearly never seen what war is really like. They would simply enslave everyone that would be annexed to their nation and put them to slave labor as reparation for the war they waged against them despite Noxus being almost always the aggressor.\n\nEver heard of the Noxian invasion of Ionia? Completely unprovoked, they came and killed everyone for no other reason than conquest. They're just animals with no sense of peace, harmony or humanity. If someone wiped them out, i'm sure Runeterra would be a much more peaceful place.\n\nAnd using a social ladder is not really a great comparison to make. You climb \"up\" via achievements you make in your life. Ekko created a portable time-machine, i'm sure he'd be granted a science lab in Piltover if they accepted him. Vayne is a super-agile hunter, pretty sure Ashe could use someone like that.\n\nPiltover uses a class-based hierarchy system yet characters like Caitlyn and Vi can rise up from nothing through hard work anyway. And i'm pretty sure both of them didn't work the farm for 40 years to do that.

But unlike you, I also read about Ionia and what happened there, let me - a proper Noxian aristocrat - educate you about the facts and history: Ionia was supposed to get plundered only because of Grand General Boram Darkwill's age and agonizing fear of death. He wanted us to just steal and bring anything of magical might that could help him prolong his life. That's why it was so brutal, that's why it did not succeed: Because it's actually not what Noxians believe in. It was solely to fuel the greed (as you said) of Darkwill, an old madman, not to help the nation to expand and allow other folk in it. That's also why, in the end, Darkwill got taken down.\n\nAnd to also support my claim: You should educate yourself about Roshka Gloriana val-Lokan (OoC: Holy fuck I actually remember that name, I only left *Alyssa* out), her people, her brother and father and their interaction with Noxus.\n\nCaitlyn hasn't ever struggled as far as I know (\"Born to a wealthy and influential family of hextech artificers in Piltover, (...)\") and Vi is a lucky exception (which occured just because of personal interaction with the higher class), that's not how the society works and the four families wouldn't even allow it to change, I'm sure people like lady Ferros would make (even personally) sure the system benefits them the way it does/exclusively.\nCompare them to Darius and Draven, who both were born into the similar conditions as Vi but never created a relationship with anyone important - frankly because Noxians believe no single person is important (\"I am no lord of yours.\" -Darius) - but pushed themselves to the top. Or Swain, who has been born into an aristocratic family (noxian aristocracy has formed under Darkwill as a toxic by-product) but struck to the rock bottom after his failures in Ionia and then reaching absolute top against all circumstances like public contempt - which in other societies would mean you are just doomed.","replies":[{"poster":"rtbf225618241","date":"2018-07-13T13:41:16.725+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You really think i need to do research on a stereotype?

What the hell? Describe a bit better. So these soldiers went and slaughtered everyone while being like \"Man fuck this Darkshit guy. I don't want to be here.

Being wealthy doesn't grant you a high reputation among the crime world and it certainly doesn't turn you into a sniper. I'm sure she never had to struggle for food or shelter but that isn't required. The point is that she had to work for what she has become and whether or not she is wealthy, that is a high position to hold. Saying Vi is a lucky case...you can say literally everyone who has been \"given\" powers are lucky cases if you disregard how they have used them or how they attained them in the first place.\n\nAnd Darius and Draven literally just had to hit the gym and practice killing to gain a position in which...they kill people. And if i noticed correctly, then doesn't Swain have a demonic arm?

We don't even know what pushed Darius to destroy Garen's empire. Garen seems like a reliable and good hearted person. My guess is Garen's poor judgement caused Draven to die in that universe or something like that. Then I'd probably would've sided with darius","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Yuvn Ti","date":"2018-07-13T00:55:08.832+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"tbh the garen icon wouldve looked so cool im pissed\n\nbecause dark black and red edgy characters are always cooler for the 15 year olds who listen to xxxtentacion on the daily","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dokueki Kenshin","date":"2018-07-12T20:47:16.497+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well written, friend, but this was decided the moment they pitted two champions with significantly different play rates against each other. On average, between 50-60% more people play Darius than Garen (I believe OP,gg had Garen at 3.8% playrate and Darius at anywhere between 5.6% and 5.8%). I mean, that’s not even a contest. The fact that they presented it like anything other than a laughably one sided war is kinda dumb.
