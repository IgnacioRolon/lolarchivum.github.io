I have been waiting for as long as i can remember. I did try to signup before the signups were closed but i never received an email or anything telling me whether i was accepted or rejected. I was wondering when the PBE will be back open for signups or if i could be given PBE through this post! :D Please let me know, I am getting very antsy to play it :(","replies":[{"poster":"Dark Morgana","date":"2017-08-09T00:01:09.798+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's awesome you're so active and even more cool you want to help us test new things out! It's unfortunate, but the PBE signups are still down at this time and i'm not sure when they'll be back up. I do know they are currently working on them, so the best thing for you to do is check back frequently to see if they are up and running. \n\nAs far as giving you one, i'm unable to do that :(","replies":[]},{"poster":"LittleOak","date":"2017-08-09T00:04:19.406+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly, I have played League of Legends 6/7 days since June 2016. I keep up with the PBE as it's released, I watch so many people on social media who have PBE accounts and my friend who joined season 2 has one and I'm so jealous. I cannot wait until Riot reopens sign ups. I will be one of the first people to send it a request. You are not alone friend!","replies":[{"poster":"Leyin","date":"2017-08-09T10:27:40.617+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am waiting now 3 years for pbe , never got an answer on my sign up","replies":[]}]}]}
