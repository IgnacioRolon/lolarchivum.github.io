Why do you all do this to yourselves and your team? Why do you choose this incredibly useless item (For a Bruiser, for a Squishy Destroyer) over Wit&#039;s End? It&#039;s baffling, it&#039;s incredibly mind numbing. It&#039;s so stupid I can barely contain myself evertime I see it. Even when matched against a team FULL OF SQUISHIES I still see you all choose this item over Wit&#039;s End.\r\n\r\nWhy?\r\n\r\n{{item:3091}}  gives Every Stat an AutoAttacking Brusier wants: Damage, Resistance, Attack Speed, Pen. Most AA Bruisers (Which Include: {{champion:102}} {{champion:106}} {{champion:77}} {{champion:19}}) Deal some form of Alternative Magic Damage (Be it in the Form of On-Hit or AoE), which Wit&#039;s End complements greatly. If you take Gold into Consideration, the Item gives you 100% Gold efficiency (2,600g) at full stacks, _**which is not including it&#039;s passive Reduction or Damage**_  that gives Roughly a BF sword in Damage plus Pen that all Equals out to Roughly 2.3k in additional Gold, making this item almost a 2 for 1 buy. Then, if you go further, it releases an entire Slot for other Items, a slot that BotRK would force you to make up with higher costing Items to make up for it&#039;s lack of Resistant Stats.\r\n\r\nAnd best of all Wit&#039;s End **_Doesn&#039;t force you to commit to AD centered items_**. It gives you Pen for your already Magic Dealing abilities, It deals magic damage itself and utilizes all it&#039;s stats neatly, while BotRK is essentially useless without additional AD items. It has no Pen, Countered by Armor, it&#039;s LF is pretty nonexistent at 10% and only 25 AD (And most champions not reaching past 100 at lvl18).\r\n\r\nChampions Such as {{champion:36}} {{champion:24}} {{champion:56}} {{champion:39}} all can effectively utilize Wit&#039;s End as an alternative MR and Damage Item, all of them being AA centered, all of them being Melee, all of them being Bruisers if needed. Yet, Generic Builds are abound for 3 of those 4 that incorporate BotRK _simply_ because of it&#039;s Passive On-hit, AS stat.\r\n\r\nTo put it simple, Wit&#039;s End is Superior to BotRK on most Melee&#039;s who aren&#039;t Carries (Ala {{champion:11}} {{champion:114}}). I implore you all, whenever you are doing any Build that is not Glass, to just take a minute and think: Can I get more Mileage out of Wit&#039;s End over BotRK? Chances are the answer is a resounding **YES.**","replies":[{"poster":"JustMyBassCannon","date":"2015-04-24T00:40:04.811+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"First reason; Blade of the Ruined King has sustain, and Wit's End does not. Simply put, it's offense and defense at the same time, and bruisers scale with offense and defense about equally. While WIt's End also does this, it's specialized for magic defense, not overall.\n\nSecond reason; BotRK has much higher damage output. Between having some AD for scaling ratios and dealing 8% of current HP (which beats Wit's End's proc if the target has more than 500 HP), it's pretty much always dealing more damage, even with the AS difference (+10% AS increases attack rate by <0.1 attacks per second on anyone).\n\nThird reason; The active grants a lot of sticking power plus burst damage. 10% of HP, and it steals MS from the target, making it impossible for most targets to outrun you.\n\nI agree that Wit's End is a nice item.

But my response is: **_How are you dying that bad?_**\n\nHe just stated **TWO** more reasons. It's not about dying either. It's about the attrition of resources. Mana, HP, cooldowns, etc. You have to manage all these in lane, and across the map. Having sustain ensures you can last longer. Lasting longer means a chance at beating out enemies in that category. Sustain is a powerful mechanic, it's power doubles on manaless champs like {{champion:8}}. But I digress this is about {{item:3153}} right? {{champion:24}} scales better with it. He can output more damage evenly, and the other stats and actives culminate to an overall better item. {{item:3091}} is good but it's just not a feasible end-game item. It doesn't scale, let alone fit in with all those other endgame items that have one of two things, abnormally high stats or extreme efficiency.  \n\n> As a bruiser, how are you at 5+ getting reamed so hard in Jungle that your health is always under 1/2? How does Trailblazer not Fix this? How does the Jungle Passive and the constant Mana/Health heals in jungle not make up for the damage?

Nobody is talking about getting reamed in jungle cause they didn't take Trailblazer.\n\n> BotRK may have higher output, but it lacks actual defensive stats for when you **_actually need them_**.

Absolutely so. But now that I think about it, this comparison is a bit unfair.\n\n{{item:3153}} is an offensive item that offers for defensive stats when neccesary.\n{{item:3091}} is a defensive item that requires offensive play for full effect.\n\nAnd I think you're HEAVILY underestimating the power of sustain in and out of combat. It's powerful in it's own right. Aside from potions, natural regen, and healers, it's a purchaseable, reliable way to regain HP. Realistically, you will take damage. Now surviving it is one thing, but sustaining it is another.\nMundo is a great baiter who builds tanky and on top of that, can regain all his lost HP, even while being focused.\n\nAlso, NEVER underestimate % HP damage, it stacks up FAST.\n\n> Lastly, you can buy into stick through Mallet or Gauntlet. Both provide tank stats, both provide additional Damage.\n> And buying Both is absurd in almost any situation.\n\nYou say this yet I ask this. Why hasn't this been done then?

With every basic attack, a percentage of the physical damage you deal is healed. Unless you're at full HP, this effectively translates to an increase in HP during combat.\n\nIt's not about _jungle sustain,_ it's about _combat sustain._ You're not going to be fighting a jungle monster at the same time that you fight an enemy champion--unless you're being invaded, and even then, the regen from jungle items doesn't help there--so the sustain you get from Machete-based items is not going to be useful at all times. Hell, it's only going to actually be *useful* in the early-game, when the low bonus sustain lets you jungle for longer; later on, you clear camps at least twice as fast, and the only real sustain you can get out of the jungle without Lifesteal is Ranger's Trailblazer smite (which means you lose the utility of Skirmisher's or Stalker's).\n\nNow, if we just assume an average of 200 damage per attack (at 2000 HP, the bonus proc alone is worth +160, so this is definitely a low number), each basic attack is +20 HP. Your attack speed is going to be high enough that you're dealing *at least* one attack per second, between innate bonus AS and BotRK's +40%, so that's about 100 HP per 5 seconds in combat. _Note: This is a **very low** estimate of the sustain granted by BotRK, all assuming they don't use any champion abilities to change anything._\n\nLet's not forget the \"Steal 10% of target champions max HP\" part of BotRK's active.\n\nWit's End is a later grab _if your champion synergizes with it,_ because it grants less offensive and defensive power than alternative options. BotRK is definitely, noticeably more offensive, but it also has defensive strength that you overlook.\n\n**It's not that people are dying badly and need sustain. It's that it has very appealing offensive power, and the sustain scales _directly_ with offensive power, making for strong self-synergy that Wit's End lacks.**","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"BluePolarizer","date":"2015-04-24T00:38:14.298+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"A few things:\n\nBoRK scales, wits end doesn't.

Most champs that take BoRK don't take Arpen (since they scale off of attack speed mostly and have existing on-hits) and most champs that take Arpen (AD carries) don't take BoRK. Even against a target at 500 HP, BoRK deals 65 damage (25 AD + 40 from active). At 500 HP, most players at the time you take BoRK are considered almost dead.

Remember, atk spd is only useful if you can already do damage (or if you're Kalista. :3 ) The mag dmg on Wit's end also doesn't compare to the % dmg on BotRK.

Plus, you really do want a pure offensive item on a lot of bruisers. Building straight defense on someone that's supposed to deal damage is a bad idea in pretty much every scenario. You need some offensive item. BoRK is extremely efficient in terms of damage output. BT will only ever give 80 AD and a shield that scales per level. BoRK gives damage and burst that naturally grows as the game goes on. Yeah carries are the ones that worry about inter-item scaling but Bruisers look for an extremely efficient dps item because that's the only item they will buy for damage.

There is no CC or movement speed buffs on Wit's End, but there is on BotRK's active, so if you want to stick to your targets better BotRK is the better item. And all of the champions you listed would really like to stick to targets better.\n\nAnother thing is that BotRK scales better. Since Blade of the Ruined King has % current health damage and Wit's End deals a flat amount of damage Blade of the Ruined King will scale better into the late game because of that extra damage, as everyone is getting extra health, and everyone is going to start getting some kind of magic resistance in some form.\n\nBlade of the Ruined King's sustain provides comparable survivability to Wit's End. Because BotRK has the lifesteal and Wit's End has so much of its defensive value dependent on its stacking magic resistance and its base magic resistance, the defensive values on both items are very similar. This also doesn't include the fact that Wit's End has no defensive value against a team comp with low magic damage, but Blade has defensive value against a heavy AP comp.\n\nOne last thing: Blade of the Ruined King doesn't have a bad build path. For the record, having a Recurve Bow in your recipe on live basically means that the item you are building out of it needs to be really good on the champ you are playing as or else you just shelved 900 gold that basically does nothing. For the record, the last time we actually would regularly see a Recurve Bow item was when Runaan's Hurricane made Kalista absolutely broken, and she doesn't buy it now because she won't have enough damage, and there are no champs that are strong enough with Wit's End for Recurve Bow to not be a bad pickup for later. This problem won't be so bad if the Recurve Bow changes on the PBE go through (builds out of 2 daggers and deals 10 physical damage on hit), but until then Wit's End won't be usable.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dies to Wolves","date":"2015-04-25T20:22:29.412+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"not saying wits end is bad, but if you can't stick to your target as a melee, you're screwed\n\nbork gives sticking power, wits end doesn't\n\nalso, bork gives sustain, which depending on who you're playing, is a godsend (for example, shyv is tanky but doesn't have in-built sustain.

(Honestly, I've always wanted to try it on full-build Braum for sh$%^ and giggles.)\n\nIf you build all-tank and have one slot for damage, BotRK is the way to go because regardless of whatever your piss-poor damage is, it automatically chunks 8% of their current health per hit -not counting the active. Put that on Shyv who has a Q and E that %$^& this thing and you have an initial burst of around 25% of their max health. Don't even get me on the Q passive and the fact that lifesteal is great for tanks. It is the quitessential Shyv item. You don't _not_ take this if you understand her abilities. I think Jax could make due with Wit's End in some cases, but, like Shyv, he's not entirely tank. Bruisers don't build tanky to **tank** they build tanky to trade. They're usually item-reliant. BotRK will give you decent damage regardless of your attack and it works well with several kits. Wit's End is niche pick. You use it when you need MR and the enemies are squishy or someone else can melt tanks. BotRK consistently keeps you relevant with tanky builds. Wit's End only does it certain games owing to everyone's builds and champ picks.\n\nWit's End is certainly good, I'll grant that, but BotRK is in no way useless. It's one of the best items in the game.\n\nOn Fiora and Yi though, Maw of Malmortius and Mercurial Scimitar are far superior for AD+MR. You can stack a Phantom Dancer on them later for more total damage. They're made to kill before people can kill them, not trade in barfights like Shyv or Mundo. BotRK is a noob trap on Fi.

Then ad in the 25 damage and it boosts your attack damage to 145 damage, I'm going to call it 150 for nice numbers. Then comes in the 200 armor for a 66% damage reduction for 50 damage. So BotRK makes your average AA do 50 more damage, while healing you for 5 and that's not even touching on the slow.\nWit's End reduces their MR to 75 for a 44% damage reduction. Again for nice numbers, I'm going to call this a 40% reduction. So wit's end does approximately 24 damage on hit. And that's not considering the fact that a lot of champs buying BotRK one or the other do have AD scaling.\n\nSo again, BotRK does roughly twice the damage of Wit's End and it steals MS, while providing sustain. Really, you have to be a sustained magic dealer champion against a sustained magic damage team in order for Wit's End to be better than BotRK.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Delioth","date":"2015-04-24T06:27:28.346+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It fits nicely into my Kayle's build.\n\n{{item:3085}} {{item:3115}} {{item:3091}} {{item:3071}} {{item:3153}}  And then either {{item:3006}}  or a deathcap or something. {{item:3089}} 's nice.\n\nShred all of the defenses!","replies":[]},{"poster":"InSingedWeTrust","date":"2015-04-24T04:56:22.981+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Damn, Witt's got rekt in this thread.","replies":[]},{"poster":"XxxLumberJackxxX","date":"2015-04-24T00:56:32.625+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was with you until you said Mundo should buy it.\nThen I laughed.\nBC no","replies":[{"poster":"MasterofSFL","date":"2015-04-24T02:23:08.003+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Let me Guess, you play Full Health, nothing else, Mundo who Runs around with his ulti, Dah?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Laraso","date":"2015-04-24T00:38:09.310+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tank Meta","replies":[]}]}
