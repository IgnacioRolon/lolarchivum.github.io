We can source many nerfs, changes or complete destruction of skills, items and playstyles based on the simple idea that everything should have a meaningful weakness.\n\nThen we have characters like Fizz.\n\nNow before we go any further, this isn't an OP thread, it's about how Fizz's kit has a lack of counter-play overall, making it difficult if not impossible to gain an advantage or even playing field against him.\n\nThere are three main reasons counter-play against Fizz is low:\n\n1) His Damage is Upfront\n\n2) Mobility\n\n3) His Damage is Over-tuned\n\nThe most glaring and obvious lack of counter-play is a player's inability to escape Fizz's damage. Unlike most other Assassins (Shaco, LeBlanc, Zed, ect) who's Gapclosers are either Moderate to Low damage (Depending on your combo), Fizz's Gapcloser allows Fizz to not only close the distance between him and his target it also accounts for a very hefty portion of his Damage.\n\nThe full damage readout of an Urchin Strike is as Follows:\n10-130 (+ 60% AP) + AD\n\nWhen you take into account Seastone Trident's Passive:\n\n10-130 (+ 60% AP) + AD + {(30-70 [+ 35% AP])/3}\n\nAnd When you Activate Seastone Trident:\n10-130 (+ 60% AP) + AD + {(30-70 [+ 35% AP])/3} +10-30 (+ 25% AP)\n\nAll Together it looks like this (Please Pardon if my Equation is slightly off, it's the idea that matters most):\n10-130 + AD + 3[10-23 + (11.6%AP)] + 10-30 + (85% AP)\n\nIn just one move Fizz is able to both close the distance between him and his target and Dish out Roughly 50-230 points of Damage plus Over 100% of AP in damage. Now the damage looks meager when you look at it out of context with his entire Kit, but as the game progresses and Fizz gains more and more AP, His first hit becomes much more powerful, allowing him to chunk health bars simply by Jumping to someone.\n\nIn lane this creates an incredibly frustrating dynamic, in order for most champions to make a move on Fizz, they will be within a reasonable range for Fizz to Jump to. When you consider that Fizz can easily front most of his harassment/damage (and close distance) with one ability and in such a small time frame, you realize that any trade you make against him will require very quick timing and possibly an additional spell to escape or out damage him.\n\nThis leads into his mobility. While it is the first hit that makes Fizz scary, it's his free range of the lane (and battlefield) that makes him dangerous. With Two Gap Closers and 1(3) escape(s), Fizz would already compete with most other champions as \"the most mobile,\" but then you add in his passive and things get wonky. Being unhindered by minions in lane means that the natural barriers that typically impede players from freely interacting with one another are rendered null against Fizz. This makes Zoning Fizz through Minion Control impossible, as he can easily bypass a wall of minions and move straight to you without having to use Playful to do it.\n\nThis simple passive gives Fizz an distinct advantage, as his one true escape can be saved. It means that Fizz can simply walk into range at any given opportunity and attack, then fall back with little consequence. It makes it difficult to be anywhere within the vicinity of Fizz, as you can not rely on your minions to act as a wall between you and Him and block him as you harass.\n\nThen there is Playful. We already talked about Fizz front loading his damage, but it is the fact that he can Front Load it and then leave almost immediately (and safely) that makes playing against Fizz a true pain. With a good chunk of damage loaded onto one skill, Fizz can freely jump to someone, Chunk them, then Jump away, all before he can be targeted (and if he is, it breaks). This leaves his opponents unable to make a meaningful play against Fizz, at all, all but the most tankiest champions have trouble dealing with a prolonged barrage of this.\n\nAnd that is one of the reasons his damage is over-tuned. For Fizz, dealing a large portion of his Damage is not hard, because of the Front Loading ability of Urchin Strike, but then his other two Skills (Chum and Trickster) both have a Combined 175% AP, as well as decent bases and tons of versatility packed into them. \n\nChum is unimpeded by obstacles, Slows/knocks-up, has a Large range and creates an area of control. Playful/Trickster is both a Gapcloser and an Escape, as well as a Nuke.\n\nThe fact that Fizz, once 6, can at any time initiate a fight on a target makes Chum incredibly powerful for an assassin, but then you take into consideration that it also makes it impossible to fight back against Fizz, who already has an arsenal of Mobility and Damage. Once hit, a champion for the next 2.5 Seconds essentially is unable to do anything, between the speed of Urchin Strike, the Untargetability of Playful and the Knockup of Chum, all combine to create a moment of complete invulnerability for Fizz (in a 1v1). The damage from all 4 skills is almost guaranteed to kill any non-tank champion that's taken even a little bit of damage.\n\nFizz's entire kit is counter to the idea of counter-play Riot. Players have very few opportunities to exploit Fizz's natural weaknesses (Low Health Pool, Melee), due to His Zhonya's-esq ability to nullify damage and high mobility. On top of this, Players, once caught by his Ult, have very little chance to fight back for these very same reasons. And on top of that, the damage output by Fizz alone is so quick and large that in most cases he is able to overpower you simply by existing. I have no included Items in this discussion up to this point for simplicities, but when we consider Core Items like Zhonya's and Lich Bane, it becomes apparent there is a problem.\n\nFizz needs to have his power shifted into one area or another, while having his overall power leveled out in order to make room for players to exploit his weaknesses, I prefer to keep to his strength and identity as a slippery champion who darts around the battlefield. This can take the form of reducing the Damage of Trickster and Chum, making it so that Fizz must put some damage on someone before he can initiate an assassination. Lower the range on Chum, forcing Fizz to be closer to his target in order to force a fight. Lastly, remove the slow on Chum, but increase it on Trickster, making Chum less of a \"I GOTCHA/GET AWAY FROM ME!\" Spell, and more a tool to create an opening.\n\nVarious powershifts, such as increasing the Bleed damage (Base and Ratio) on Trident, The base range of Playful (Equally lowered on Trickster) and lowering the cooldown on Urchin can push Fizz to be a more Hit and Run champion that relies on Positioning, good timing and tactics instead of a steamroller who picks and chooses when someone must die. Doing this gives players the opportunity to react to Fizz, by stretching out his damage and removing a lot of control Fizz previously had as well as being to push Fizz into a new direction that flushes out his identity by focusing on his ability to dart and dodge, be slippery and hard to catch","replies":[{"poster":"Gypsyleeboy","date":"2014-07-27T19:28:34.955+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"This makes me want top play fizz ;p\n\nEveryone has a counter, but I'll agree.\nFizz early game is scary..

Part of this, as stated by Riot, is healthy Counter-play and Counter-play can be defined as \"The ability to exploit meaningful weaknesses to gain a tactical advantage.\" To further define it, weakness is \"an inherent, obvious flaw.\" In the full context, Counter-play is being able to take advantage of something and use it to your advantage.\n\nThings such as being melee, squishy and all-in are inherent weaknesses. Being melee makes it easier to be kited. Being squishy makes being killed easier. Being all-in means being committed. Fizz inherently has all these traits, except each one is nullified by one thing or another with-in his kit. It's impossible to Kite Fizz on your own, he has two slows, a knock-up and three jumps. Squishiness is a non-factor when you can completely mitigate all damage for a period of time. While an all-in champion, Fizz has the luxury of setting up kills from afar and waiting till the last moment to strike.\n\nAs is, Fizz's weaknesses are overcome by his Kit to the point that there is no meaningful weakness or opening to exploit. Harassing Fizz is a non-option in most cases, as most abilities are projectiles and therefore subject to \"popping,\" leaving you open for an immediate attack afterwards. Trading is difficult, as the aforementioned \"Popping\" still exists as well as Fizz having superior maneuverability and front loaded damage, forcing you to either hit him after he's finished his attack (and possibly going out of position) or play placid.\n\nBy definition, if counter-play is the ability to exploit weaknesses to your advantage, then the more weaknesses and the more exploitable they are, the more counter-play something has. Vice-Versa, the less weakness something exhibits and the harder it is to exploit, the less counter-play something has.\n\nBeing forced to drop everything and CC someone is terrible counter-play. Being forced to buy a *Specific* item(s) to shut someone down, is terrible counter-play. Having to rely on turtling strategies and reactive play ***to just not lose***, is terrible counter-play. So far all methods of dealing with Fizz mentioned by proponents of Fizz (Either as Fizz players themselves or people who \"know how to deal with them\") has been one of these three.","replies":[{"poster":"FyshinaTux","date":"2014-07-28T16:06:39.919+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"If that's the case, then how do you counterplay Sejuani?

Most of his early game damage is on his E (that would be the troll pole), so if you go to hit him with something, and he dodges it and lands right on top of you, you're likely not going to win the trade. If he doesn't land on you with it, turn and throw WHATEVER you have at him, and you'll win the trade 99% of the time. Additionally, Fizz REALLY needs items to do what he needs to do, so if he doesn't roll his lane, or roam and roll other lanes, he won't have the same ability to assassinate people.\n\nWhat people fail to realize, is that his E and his ult are *skillshots*, meaning they can both be dodged.\n\nStop using Fizz as an example of OP.

Once you're on them they either kill you, or attempt to CC you long enough before they can make an escape.\n\nLucian has his problems, which have been already stated by Riot.\n\nCaitlyn, Immobile, slow, low DPS for a carry.\n\nI could go into detail as to why each and everyone one of these champions has weakpoints, where they are, like how Annie's Range is short, that Naut has no damage (when it matters), But that's not the point. No, the point is there are Champions out there that have very few and exploitable weaknesses because the weaknesses inherent in their character are covered by their Kits and their Kits are strong enough to withstand a lot.\n\nFizz's ultimate is a skill shot, why is it on a 1000+ range? Why does it have that, along with a 100% ratio as well as a 70% slow, and a Knockup and an AoE one at that, when this Champion also has 60% slow on another skill, three Jumps and a large amount of damage to boot.\n\nFor someone who is as mobile as Fizz, it seems redundant that he would need a Skill with such a range and amount of utility, just to overtake a target. Saying that because it's a \"skillshot\" make it ok, that some how being a \"skillshot\"  makes it \"counter-play\" is weak at best. It's not blocked by Minions, it's fairly fast, early game it's a difficult shot to land, at all.\n\nBut then, what about the other way around, about if you want to attack Fizz? Well, we've been over that, you don't. Just about every piece of advice you or any other proponent of his current iteration has said \"Just wait till Troll Pool is Down,\" 'Wait for him to go all in,\" \"Wait for him to make a mistake.\" And in-lies the problem, I can't control the field against Fizz on my own, I can't actively make an advance on Fizz and use my intuition, my abilities to knock him out of lane. I have to wait for him to make the first move, for him to blow his cooldowns before I can even make one myself and hope I'm not dead. That, right there, is a lack of counter-play. Counter-play is not \"countering,\" it is not reactive in nature, it is proactive. It is you being able to use something to your advantage, not waiting for something to make it even.\n\nMost of your argument can really boil down to this, because other champions have powerful abilities, or problems, we should ignore Fizz's. That because he has certain attributes to him, we should allow him to do what he does. That instead of their being a problem with Fizz and his core design, it's other people who just need to \"get good.\"\n\nIf you've never read about Riot's own views on Game design, if you don't what they consider Counter-play and why it's needed, I suggest you go look it up and read and then come back.","replies":[{"poster":"FyshinaTux","date":"2014-07-29T04:57:06.792+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":1,"body":"You fail to understand sarcasm...\n\nI was pointing out that the OP was talking about what Fizz CAN do, so I gave counterpoints that fit that description to show how his post was flawed, because OBVIOUSLY people know how to counter the people I listed...","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Phoenix Kotori ","date":"2014-07-28T20:02:03.534+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You 100% missed the point of this thread good job.\n\n>What people fail to realize, is that his E and his ult are skillshots, meaning they can both be dodged.\n\nDodging his ult is one thing, but his E has an extremely forgiving hit area making dodging it not simply.","replies":[{"poster":"FyshinaTux","date":"2014-07-28T20:19:27.096+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wrong, her E has a forgiving area on the first cast, on the second cast the area is DRASTICALLY reduced.\n\nMost Fizz try to land the first cast for the slow, rather than the second for the damage. ;)","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"The Lexer","date":"2014-07-28T12:29:39.194+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"As a Fizz main I can tell you once he dives on your carry and uses ult and e, hes stuck in the entire enemy team with maybe a flash of zhonyas.

If they lead off with E, they have no escape and either burn flash to try to get away or you take the opportunity to take out a good chunk of his health.\n\nHis ult is a pretty narrow skillshot and is really not that hard to dodge if you have considerable experience going up against skillshot-reliant champions like blitz, thresh, or nidalee.\n\nAhri vs Fizz, for example, is basically a guaranteed win if you can land your charm- you can use your ultimate to dodge his e/r (or get back to safety if he lands his ult, forcing him to either dive you or back off) and charm him mid-q (to do so only requires quick reflexes, as it should be easy to hit a target that's coming straight for you).\n\nI've also had good experience against Fizz as Diana- her shield can negate quite a bit of damage while dealing some back, and the double-dash you can get on your ultimate is an amazing gap-closer if he tries to escape on his troll pole.\n\nBut, in general, so long as you don't use your crowd control until after his troll pole goes on cooldown and you can keep your distance and keep him poked down, it really is not that difficult to beat fizz in lane.","replies":[{"poster":"MasterofSFL","date":"2014-07-28T09:54:57.734+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"This is the age old \"just CC them\" arguement.

You have to layer it, like crazy, from multiple different people in most cases just to get one through.\n\nSaying \"CC them\" is a way to counter ANYONE is a piss poor argument because while anyone can be CC'd, and die, others take so much more to get to that point that in some cases it takes entire teams to make it happen.
