Note that the last couple of weeks I've been running a steady 120 fps at full graphics. I just want to know if anyone has also been confronted by this problem. Currently I have 40-50 fps which is good but still lags for some reason. NOTE: Ping is 20 as well as how I have a solid gaming laptop. Thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2015-03-26T01:43:51.552+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hello War Prepared!\n\nDropping that extreme of FPS does sound incredibly odd.  It may have been due to something with the texture updates with SRU, but I would like to look at more common causes for such a drop of FPS.

Had no issues on 5.5, but after updating to 5.6, I'm getting frameskips/minifreezes what feels like once every ten seconds (or worse). I've repaired the installation, restarted, made various adjustments to the graphics settings in game and my video card driver settings and then tested them in customs, and... well, I'm just having no luck fixing it no matter what I try. It's really hurting my ability to enjoy the game.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MwarriorHiei","date":"2015-03-26T06:09:53.346+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"same issue for me. i was averaging around 20 fps before the patch. after the patch, the game never goes over 4 fps. happens on both howling abyss and summoner's rift. i have everything set to very low as well.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nazzadan","date":"2015-03-26T01:47:47.783+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I get terrible FPS drops in the fountain.
