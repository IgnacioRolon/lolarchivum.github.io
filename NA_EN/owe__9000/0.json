Wild right. that way, u can save loads of money and we all see the tribunal for what it is. mob rule. its mob rule. if 9 people report you, u don&#039;t have a shot in the world Ghandi, Mother Theresa. I do my very best to mute immediately, but why should they get to say WHATEVER THE HELL they want to and I can&#039;t defend myself. and u can go ahead and throw away that dogshit .0008% of the players get perma banned bullshit. not buying it. I alone have enough accounts perma banned to satisfy that number, all for defending myself, every single time. I don&#039;t talk shit but I also don&#039;t take shit, and ive come to the realization that I may not be able to play this game. O well right ur about the mob! but I love every other aspect of this game and will continue to rise in the ranks and show new possibilities to even the best. I mean no one in the pros even use Vel and he would incinerate all with a little bit of competence.  and losing rewards FOR THE ENTIRE YEAR because of a chat ban? or any 14 day ban THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE YEAR and no rewards........AFTER THEY SERVED THEIR TIME....are we not free men once again after serving our time? it literally requires you to play your alt account (or create yet another...running out of ideas for emails here...)why would anyone play for no rewards? u can play for the sheer love of the game on ur alt too....but again I know you trib, and u don&#039;t give a shit about any of this. the tragedy being I&#039;m actually ur best friend telling u ur on the curve of trophies for every sheep, just for being sheep. ya know, we ALL have options to censor chat AND to mute anyone sooo TELL ME. WHY CAN SOMEONE ELSE CALL ME  A SHITTER BUT WHEN I CALL HIM ONE IM BANNED? I&#039;ll enlighten you since I&#039;m sure your either as disconnected or apathetic as the rest of the trib...its mob rule. It&#039;s a failed utilitarian cult with the goal of Utopia. Now here&#039;s why it SHOULD matter to those of u higher up money grovelers. Because there is a large market of solo players who are victimized solely because they didn&#039;t make a pre made. Just like with the honor system. I can&#039;t tell you how many games I&#039;ve HARD carried and gotten no honors. because premades honor their premades ALWAYS! DO YOU NOT SEE THIS? I&#039;ve honestly had games where every single player knew the ONLY reason we won was because of me. nothing. and in a typical game I don&#039;t speak at all, in fact never unless I&#039;m defending myself or someone on my team is INTENTIONALLY lowering my chance of victory. so not only no rewards but perma bans. that way u make more money when I start another account since u know your &quot;lessons&quot; don&#039;t work. People who rage are passionate, so they almost always return, or leave butthurt. Compassion encompasses ALL, try it.","replies":[{"poster":"SavageConcordia","date":"2017-09-06T23:49:58.855+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":">throw the tribunal in the garbage.  \n\nThey did, like 3 years ago. \n\n>if 9 people report you  \n\nThat's out the window with tribunal, it is and has been for a long time a if report, then review, numbers of reports no longer mater.  \n\n> I alone have enough accounts perma banned to satisfy that number,  \n\n0.008% of league is roughly 8000 accounts. You do not have 8000 permabanned accounts. \n\n> and losing rewards FOR THE ENTIRE YEAR because of a chat ban?  \n\nNot even remotely true. If you don't have a time ban, a ban for boosting or are not actively chat banned when the season ends you get ranked rewards and the new honor system will let you continue to get keys, honor capsules ect. once you get your account back into good standing. \n\nI'm done going through this. All of your information about how this game works is so painfully out of date it is exhausting. Go look at the current state of the game before complaining about how it was 3 years ago.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2017-09-06T23:36:55.160+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=OWE  9000,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=Esvn2i8e,comment-id=,timestamp=2017-09-06T23:15:30.718+0000)if 9 people report you, u don&amp;#039;t have a shot in the world\n\nFirstly, the Tribunal hasn't been around for a while -- the new system is the Instant Feedback System, or IFS.\n\nSecondly, and more importantly, the system doesn't work on the number of reports. It works on a Yes/No flag that detects if *between 1 and 9 reports are filed against you*, in which case it marks \"Yes.\" The number doesn't matter. The system just checks for the flag, and then runes through it to see if the behavior was toxic.\n\n>all for defending myself, every single time.\n\nDo you have any logs to share? Normally, when I see this argument, there is content that the player feels is a defense but is actually just an attack they justify as defense.\n\n>WHY CAN SOMEONE ELSE CALL ME  A SHITTER BUT WHEN I CALL HIM ONE IM BANNED?\n\nBecause you both have broken the rules, and you are both subject to the same rules system. If you report him it's a strike against him as well, and who gets banned first depends on both of your personal behaviors and account standings up until that point.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Imperial Pandaa","date":"2017-09-07T00:24:47.545+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I stopped reading pretty early. Here are 3 things to go ahead and point out.\n\n1. Tribunal has been gone for a while.\n\n2. Number of reports in a single game doesn't matter. 1 report has the same effect as 9.\n\n3. The %0.0008 number is an approximation and you seem to not understand how math works. You claim you have enough accounts banned alone to reach that number. See below\n\n      3a. Lets use a small number of just a million people. Multiply that by .0008 and you get 800 accounts. If you managed to even have that number, I fear for your mentality and sanity.\n \n       3b. The number of accounts is not static. So if we have a million players and 800 people get banned then we reach %0.0008, but say half of them make a new account to keep playing. 400 new accounts replace 400 of the banned ones. Now we still have 800 banned accounts, but the number of accounts is now 999,600 after they remade accounts as opposed to the 999,200 when they were banned.\n\nSo as bans go out, a new account may be made, therefore fluctuating the percent value of accounts banned v not banned.\n\nYou can claim to stop reading early, but it isn't as painful to read as the OP.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2017-09-06T23:18:19.461+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is anyone going to read a wall of text that doesn't have proper capitalization?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Periscope","date":"2017-09-07T01:49:01.711+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you read all of this, congrats!
