He is D4 in 3's, I'm Plat 4 and we've been playing together without issue for a while now. However, after the patch, the client is telling me the ranked difference is too large, and that he is not an eligible flex partner. Is this intentional, and, if so, why on earth was this change implemented?","replies":[{"poster":"I am Blaziken","date":"2017-09-28T15:48:25.408+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for the response. We have been duoing just fine before the patch though, is this a result of the updating the 3's matchmaking and P&B system? If so can I also just take a moment to say that I personally disagree with this decision. The matchmaking in 3's is already so broken with the flex queue system and the relatively small player base that I've personally been in numerous games where Plat and Diamond players end up in games with Silver players. If I'm going to be matched with people extremely far away from my rank by the system itself, I think it's pretty unfair that I cannot play with someone who's only one tier higher than me.\nThat being said, is there any chance the system gets reverted, or am I just ranting for no reason? I only ask because I saw a riot response on reddit that they'd be monitoring the changes to 3's queueing and matchmaking with the potential to revert or redo some of the changes, and I was hoping to state my opinion.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-28T02:42:29.619+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmmm I had to do a little digging myself on this tbh. It looks like you two won't be able to queue together from the limitations after all =\\.....\n\n- Platinum Tier: Can only queue with Gold and Platinum players, with exceptions listed below.\n- Diamond IV: Can only queue with Platinum I, II, and Diamond I, II, III, IV, V players.\n\nYou can see all of the other limitations right [**over here**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204010760#h1q3)!","replies":[]}]}
