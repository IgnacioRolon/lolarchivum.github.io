I didn't make this change and have access to the email on the account. I even tried going through each individual region with my username and password to see if someone compromised my account, but it isn't showing my account on any region. I submitted a ticket about this issue just a few minutes ago and would like someone to take a look at this please.\r\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-11-25T21:55:47.613+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heya, submitting a ticket was a good plan so our AR team can check this out for you and help!
