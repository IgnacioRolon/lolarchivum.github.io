(www.facebook.com/Ayriath)\nPhoto by Ngo Photographt! (www.facebook.com/NgoPhotography)\n\nThe weapons were fully 3D printed and took me about four-five months to complete! The gradient work on Fishbones was done by hand, including the detail painting, and PowPow was airbrushed with automotive paint. \n\nPoor Zap can&#039;t be seen, but he&#039;s there! I&#039;ll have more pictures with him showing him. He lights up beautifully-I actually had to rewire him twice because the first time, the wires were too large to fit inside his barrel. \n\nNext League projects are: Pool Party Leona and Star Guardian Lux. \nI&#039;ve also already done Spellthief Lux!\n\nFollow my work if you wish! I&#039;ll post streaming/posting prop and costume creation soon if anyone ever wanted to get into the world of cosplaying. :)\n\nEdit: Photo of Zap now available! Also 3D printed. Wish it was darker so you could see it light up, but that's sometimes hard to transition into photos. \n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/FwkH4Bp.jpg\n\nBonus fishbones love:\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/StwKarh.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"FrankerX","date":"2016-04-27T02:28:40.597+0000","up_votes":51,"down_votes":2,"body":"10/10 would f... feed.","replies":[{"poster":"HorusEye","date":"2016-04-27T22:40:54.679+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://i3.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/018/083/image.jpg","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2016-04-27T02:35:29.676+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":0,"body":"Holy shit, that's some of the best jinx cosplay I've seen.
