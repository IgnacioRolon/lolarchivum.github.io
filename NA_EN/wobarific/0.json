His 'ideal' scenario is himself at low health, enemy targets at low health, and no CC or lockdown. That's what he's great at. That's what he's designed to shine in. He's meant to track down, chase, and easily kill low health targets.\n\nIf you 2v1 WW, and you don't let him get you low, he's an absolute joke. If you 2v1 WW, and CC him when he's low (and you are too) to prevent his healing, he's an absolute joke. IF you 2v1 WW, are low health, and don't CC him, **you are going to have a bad day and that is intentional.**","replies":[{"poster":"Power Cosmic","date":"2018-04-24T19:43:53.804+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Along with that he also has a strong lockdown, shield, cc, sustain, damage, strong on objectives... In MOBAs a good champ can't do everything, and if they do; they sacrifice doing damage.  Conversely if you have a lot of damage it wouldn't make much sense to also be a cc bot, with escapes and tank.  Take fighter Diana... what does she get in trade for not being able to do what WW can?  The answer should be significantly more late game damage, to carry through an oppressive utility champ.  Oppressive utility champs like WW should not be doing that much damage (or dueling) bc they are doing everything else.

Outside of his own ultimate, and a gimmicky Q+E fear backwards combo, Warwick doesn't really \"provide\" for his team. Yes, he can snowball early ganks, those are usually when he can guarantee his allies can gain enough early pressure themselves to activate his passive effects. He's very much reliant on the opponent being stupid, and his abilities give plenty of interaction. Flash as he rushes to Q you under your tower to position him into firing range, or bait out his ultimate and force a bad play where warwick wastes time chasing you around. The only reason he's even considered good right now is because damage is so ridiculously high, and even then he doesn't even have that much damage to begin with since most of his damage is lowered to compensate for the large amount of healing and damage he is purposely meant to sustain.\n\nalso, the large problem is that his AD ratios aren't even that boastful, since he's so reliant on autoattacking point blank, and his abilities outside of Q are most utility focused or meant as a control move. if you're a squishy, buy a tabi. Laugh. If you're tank, buy a thornmail/bramblevest, and laugh. Warwick's damage isn't the thing to touch, if they wanted to nerf his early gank, drop his early speed as warwick isn't focused on early game in the first place, but his ability to gank is just good when people get chunked, and this meta defines ridiculous damage. The second it comes down, warwick will still probably be fine. Warwick just is that balanced, he has fair interactions and plays off an opponent's overconfidence.","replies":[{"poster":"CytheGuy","date":"2018-04-24T22:36:38.514+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The one thing you never mentioned was his ability to tank. His fear at max rank provides 55% damage reduction, and he is able to build more tanky while still being able to accomplish the \"I do more damage when you are low\" ideal with his passive and the fact that his Q at max rank does 10% max hp damage. In a general sense I would say that his AD ratios are fairly high, the thing is that he doesn't build that much AD to begin with, so they never come to assassin-level fruition in his most ideal builds. In a high damage meta, all it takes are a couple good pokes from a laner to set off his W passive, so I wouldn't entirely say he is reliant on opponents being stupid, but he is reliant on his team's ability to incorporate is semi-unique playstyle into their own plans. It's easy to tell him to gank you, all you have to do is put down some damage (which is fairly easy assuming you aren't laning against someone who is just better at poking than you are).","replies":[{"poster":"General Theritt","date":"2018-04-25T13:12:39.567+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=CytheGuy,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ExxivyaW,comment-id=000600000000,timestamp=2018-04-24T22:36:38.514+0000)\n>\n> The one thing you never mentioned was his ability to tank.

His AD ratios and damage overall isn't high (outside of his ult, which is on a pretty reasonable cooldown), and i did mention he's meant to sustain large amounts of damage, so that fits into his E. I pointed out, its not hard to deal damage in this meta, because its too easy to simply put out damage and ask warwick to gank, and a stupid player will over-estimate themselves and think \"i'll be fine\". Its not a bad thing to back when you're below 50% HP and reeling from a bad fight. Farm under tower to make sure it isn't pushed, and back as soon as you can. If they decide to drop their jungler on you, waste their team, force them to make bad dives that force them to back and lose the lane advantage they would've gained.\n\nLike i said, the best nerf would've been to just lower his early W movement speed, and pretty much nothing to his damage. His one thing is that his major advantage is on low health targets, or his own low HP. If you're high HP and fight warwick, you will usually win the trade since warwick will not be able to come back from the sheer health loss without wasting his ult or using all his CC in one go. When you look at it, all that needs to go down is the actual damage and poke since warwick only deals so much damage once he can pounce in on a target, and if people aren't getting chunked constantly, warwick moves down and settles at his usual strong but fair winrate. Also, notice how even in competitive, warwick has been proven useful, but is actually rarely picked. there are just champions with better niches with much stronger gank power, Warwick is just more easily accessible by lower ranking players, which brings his winrate up, and to newer players he's a god-send of showing unique gameplay. Warwick doesn't really need to change, because before this meta, he wasn't even that dominant. Even now, he still isn't THAT dominant, he matches with a lot of other popular or regular pick junglers with a 5~% playrate, while Lee Sin is still sitting at 10%. Why isn't everyone playing the champion that apparently boasts a lower winrate, but has twice the playrate? Its because warwick is simple but effective, and incredibly balanced. He doesn't have anything pushing him over the edge besides his unqiue gank pressure.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Blåbæret","date":"2018-04-24T23:35:26.036+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem with WW is that you can't really kill him.
