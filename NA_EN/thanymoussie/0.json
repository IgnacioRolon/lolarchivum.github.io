I double tap the icon on my screen then it loads. It loads a screen, the client, and says, \"league of legends need to require an update.\" And it loads automatically. It opens this small screen and says league of legends on the top and the loading bar below it. It reaches about almost all the way then restarts again. Then, it says \"league of legends need to require and update\" AGAIN! I need help! I have a Mac by the way.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-25T00:50:48.729+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you still experiencing this?
