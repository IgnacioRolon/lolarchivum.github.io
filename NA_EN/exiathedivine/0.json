And Losing more almost more than earning.","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So I recently got to silver 4, got deranked back to silver 5 got back into silver 4. Now I am in Silver 4 I win 23lp to 26lp I do not understand why I get so much to be honest. But when I lost one game tonight I lost 18 lp, and for some reason the game before I got awarded 23lp but only 18 showed up on my account? I am very confused as to why I am losing so much, for 1 match to where as before at most I only lost 6-12lp. if someone could help me understand this system or tell me why climbing is becoming so difficult that would be nice.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-28T22:33:30.350+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The LP adjustments can vary depending on the matchup and average MMR of each team.  If you are matched against a team and matchmaking determines that you have a good chance of winning but lose, you could lose more LP.  On the other hand, if matchmaking determines that you have a good chance of losing but end up winning then you can earn more LP for that game.
