This Account has been STOLEN and I am trying to get it back.","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Like I have said in the title someone has stolen my account and changed the email on me. I have submitted a ticket to riot but since the changed email address has not verified the account I cannot view my ticket. The person is trying to transfer my account credentials and champions to the EU Nordic server from the north American server. I am only able to log in her to post this because the password is the same as it was and I was able to find the server they are trying to move my account to on lolking. Please If there is a moderator or a riot employee online who is reading this please stop the transfer.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-23T20:23:46.376+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You'll need to use that [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to get hooked up with our account team so that they can help you secure your account! Make sure that you pick \"I need help recovering my account\" when you make that ticket so that you can see it without being logged in. Once they verify you as the account owner they'll be able to repair any damage that was done.","replies":[{"poster":"Ruffiecolada","date":"2017-07-25T17:05:47.621+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks, the riot team has gotten back to me and restored my account.
