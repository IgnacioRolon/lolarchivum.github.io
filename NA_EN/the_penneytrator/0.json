If this is the case, I recommend [rolling back those updates](http://www.howtogeek.com/235474/how-to-roll-back-builds-and-uninstall-updates-on-windows-10/) to see if it resolves the issue.\n\nIf that doesn't help or if you're not on Windows 10, your issue is most likely caused by driver problems or hardware issue.
