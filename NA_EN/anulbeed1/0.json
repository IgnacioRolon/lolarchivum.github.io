I get the chat pop ups every time i log in . how do i leave the inactive team ? \nyou can shoot me an e-mail at --snip-- or I will try to find this post.  \n\nI saw another post from 2011 that says there is supposed to be a tab to click on but, I haven't been able to locate the tab or anyway to leave the team .  I was hoping there was a command like /leave team or something like that that i can type in the chat box. \n\nThanks a million . \n\nDaniel","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-27T16:56:41.131+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not a good idea to share your email address through a public venue, so I snipped it out for your privacy.
