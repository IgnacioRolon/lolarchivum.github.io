It does not even need to be toxic speech during the game, it seems like just 2 people arguing about something is ban worthy. Arguing is natural and is very likely to happen in teams of 5 people who all have important roles. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, even as a kid playing good ol' Runescape, it was very rare to receive a ban or chat restriction for something as little as arguing. Now why is the league of legends community so much more sensitive than even the old Runescape community which consisted of much younger players. \r\n\r\nHow it is right now is very unhealthy for the game. Basically, if you are not a positive nancy, EVERY SINGLE GAME you will be banned. Well guess what, sometimes when there is a kid picking unorthodox champs for his lane and intentionally feeding, you are not happy with having to waste time waiting for the game to end. Afterwards, its not the kid that is trolling who gets punished, ITS THE PLAYER WHO GOT IRRITATED THAT HE IS WASTING TIME!\r\n\r\nAt this rate, people who have spent years trying to climb to high ranks can be banned from just one bad game that consists of a troll that you must release your displeasure to. I love this game but I am so close to quitting only because of how easily everything you worked for gets thrown away, just because you had a normal argument with a teammate? \r\n\r\nI am sure it is not just me who believes that when you compare the league community to other online games, this is the most pussy community by far.","replies":[{"poster":"Chermorg","date":"2018-01-10T02:55:41.607+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"RuneScape has basically fallen off the face of the Earth, and one reason is the immensely toxic environment making it basically a single player game.\n\nThis community isn't \"pussy\", it's normal.

You can literally just mute people, shut up, and play the game. No this isn't me being rude, this is me being truthful.\n\nYou can spend 20 minutes to try and convince your 0/7 Hecarim to teamfight instead of splitting because that's how you'll win but in the end you wasted 20 minutes for an action that he won't differentiate from. This is just hypothetical of course but I gave up trying to argue with people and just get them to win the game because it just adds more unnecessary stress for me. At this point it's just :\n- Play game\n- Wait for brain to fall out\n- People being toxic? Mute them.\n- Jungler 0/20 and still trying to gank a 15/2 midlaner that's fed? I give up trying to convince them\n- Repeat until RNG blesses me with decent teammates\n\nAt this point I don't play to win but to just HOPE to win because in the end it's a team game. I spare myself of all the stress and just play the game with the whole chat muted if I have to spare a headache even.","replies":[]},{"poster":"YerroFever","date":"2018-01-10T03:27:44.045+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I would disagree with your characterization regarding the community of league of legends and I also disagree with your characterization on how to not be permabanned. \n\nFirst I'll address the permaban characterization. You don't have to be a \"positive nancy\" (btw, I think this is fairly indicative of your toxic chat behavior) every single game to not be permabanned. The standard is \"don't be dishonorable.\" This has been repeated by several red posts. \n\nSecond, regarding the league community characterization and comparisons....\n\nRunescape is awful. I have no idea how you tolerate the people in Runescape but they are so juvenile and immature that it's not fun to play with others. It's almost like playing exclusively with screaming children throwing temper tantrums who have the vocabulary and technical knowledge of teenagers. Kudos to you if you have the patience to deal with that but I don't. I'd rather have people just not talk and focus on the game rather than try to blame everyone and everything else for their mess up and then turn into a giant flame fest which ends up being ultra disruptive because they would have done better had they not spent so much time in the fountain typing at teammates.\n\nWhat you can do for your example about intentional feeding teammates is report them and move on. What isn't health is you holding on to your bitter rage and then trying to be toxic by expressing your \"irritation\" in an antisocial way. You can address inters and trolls in a pro social way without flaming them and without insulting them and still let them know their behavior is unacceptable and move on. This is actually good for the community because it weeds out the toxic players that make playing the game not fun. They'll either learn that their behavior is anti social and will stop it or they will be permabanned from the community. If there is 1 troll in a game, it's better to ban that 1 troll and keep 9 players rather than keep 1 troll and lose 9 good players due to the toxic environment... like what's happened in Runescape...\n\nYou are definitely not the only one who considers the league of legends community to be \"pussy\" (also way to prove how toxic you aren't by being sexist) but you'll notice that those that agree with you are the ones who have been punished in the past and or permabanned, which is a minority of players... which means your behavior is not the norm.\n\nYou'll also see that many other large companies are starting to address toxicity in their games. Just google it. You won't have to look very far to find large name companies addressing toxic behavior on their games because it's hurting their bottom line.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DarthNocturnis","date":"2018-01-12T02:33:26.115+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol!\n\nDude...I got permabanned off Runescape for playing the game on Firefox......\nRiot's being too sensitive?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Peritheus","date":"2018-01-10T17:51:40.847+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Normal?

You know pussy cat...,*boos in the distance*Where did the those that lighten the mood go oof.~~\n\nAnyway It's not RITO being WAY too sensitive, it's the future generation being way too sensitive, always finger itching triggerhappy to report anything abusive/emotionally weak, the smallest amount of negativity a word can cause even if it was used against yourself like will literally be punished,in fact there are legit tips in the game(tbh they suck) that advise you to report so and so if they make you feel even the slightest bit uncomfortable, so what do you see now in most chats during the game now since you had once love it, you already know, a cold desolate, snowball tilt fest, where the goal is to 1 shot minions and players rushing their powerspike and force a game to end deciding the game practically 10-20 mins in is very \"fun\" It's legit either make the enemy team ragequit(or your team lol...) through killing them infinitely so they surrender more times than ending the nexus, there once was a never surrender motto, yeah it died out when everything in the game 1 shotted, out the wazoo, even the tank cc sup 100 0 the adc too, so let's still hold my teammates hostage selfishly 3/2, even though it 5 hours with over 300 kill lead and they won't be punished whatsoever, prob a tap on the wrist versus those that afk, said 1 negative word,hacked etc there's a Mnemosyne of information about it, but to adapt/cater to the large pop. they had to kill off what truly made the game, great loveable and fun, worthy over any other game at the time because well the support between the community and rito were goofy,wierd,quirky like my corki,don't need no horsey, we the toxic community in all of us, warped rito into making this and also well to get people like you and I off their back, who know their countless past failures, wrongdoings,excuses, cowardice to not admit that they were wrong,controversial moments,broken mmr and queue times,bad balancing,stockpiling years of reports,suggestions,bugfixes even though they are successful billionaires a good chunk of veterans leave this game... and what awaits for the fut gen? Prob the same doom fate, get reported even though all you did was type in Mordekaiser into your mastery page and it's censored scenario after leaving 1000 awesome friendly conversations about how clean your flat world earth theory is and someone booed you, you booed them back, bam punished even if you quote them,because well it's a salem witch trial on here, with just a 1 sided blind perspective logs, everyone's so sketchy and biased judgey so they get gun down with downvotes like @@@@@@ even if they made an amazing defense, there's always  a better attorney to put you down and thus many in player behavior never return, never learn reform as it cycle continues again, \n\nAnyway point is it's fine to take a break in a while, you know ;p give in to your meals on wheels feed yas, play mobility cc spell mage  version of annoying  singed, wardmo, legit just a ward all game stealing xp and making bad plays that bait your teammates giving them constructive criticism like I have sightstones and already warded, y isnt game over, I stole 0 cs&kills, and have sighhhstone from how disappointing my adc is.","replies":[]},{"poster":"braindead eboy","date":"2018-01-10T05:31:05.404+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"They do not understand arguments can be positive, you can say things in a negative manner but the overall message can be positive.
