You can do this by unplugging your modem and/or router for 30+ seconds, as *Jasiwel* mentioned, before plugging them back in. If you continue to see increased latency in-game, I recommend working through our [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to ensure that you aren't running any network settings that could cause a poor connection to our servers.\n\nPlease let me know if this helped.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jasiwel","date":"2017-02-14T01:13:11.307+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you tried the following:\n\n1.) Have you flushed your DNS? \n\n2.) Turned off your Router, waited 30 seconds, turned it back on?\n\n3.)
