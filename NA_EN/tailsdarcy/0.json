I filled out the network log tool, but I was just wondering if/when it is going to be fixed. {{champion:32}}","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-25T22:50:44.417+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This trace confirms the issues occur along Shaw and Zayo's networks. Unfortunately, you'll need to get in contact with Shaw again and provide them this trace so they can investigate further. I suggest requesting a tier 2 agent or a manager so you'll have better chances at getting some action taken.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions.","replies":[{"poster":"tailsdarcy","date":"2016-10-26T01:32:29.154+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looks like someone, somewhere fixed it.
