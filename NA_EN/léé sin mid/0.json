First they changed my favorite adc into a jungler {{champion:104}} .  Then they added some shitty dragon buffs, and made all tanks overpowered as fuck \"full armor malphite one shots adc's\". Now you decided to nerf Yasuo because kids are crying that he's \"overpowored, no skill champ\". Yeah, nerfing his fking shitty early game to literally unplayable early game is a good idea to ruin my favorite champ again, thanks! \r\nThen my main account gets stolen and permabanned for being toxic or some shit and they wont unban it. \"Im toxic now couse of that reason :)\".\r\nAnd you even added an autofill system because people don't play support, and some of them just troll instead of going support or do rly bad because support is a boring role, and it was never fun and never will be, i don't care what you support mains say about it, you just play it couse you can't play other roles. I bet most people just play this game to waste some time. From season 1 to 5 the game kept going in the right place, but after that it just became garbage.","replies":[{"poster":"Perma CC","date":"2017-02-19T18:49:52.421+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Was about to upvote this until I realized it wasn't a thread complaining about Lethality or Edge of Night.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BeatzBoyFTW","date":"2017-02-19T14:10:55.403+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"And look at how much effort it took you to make a smurf just to post this.","replies":[{"poster":"Léé Sin Mid","date":"2017-02-19T14:47:30.444+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This account is old af lmao xd","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Khas","date":"2017-02-19T14:15:06.806+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"you sound like a shitty little whiney douche bag.

Stay on topic and quit talking about stuff you know nothing about.\n\nThe main issue with this game is that damage is too high all around. Everyone hits like they were designed for burst.

If it's the first one ofc. that's the next step after the chat restricts you earned, and after 14-day is a perma.  If it's the second one Riot support wouldn't tell you if he got given a 2-week ban on his acc.  You'd only know that if you knew him irl.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Moetaro","date":"2017-02-19T15:15:17.958+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> i don't care what you support mains say about it, you just play it couse you can't play other roles\n\nNah, I play support because I cant stand to wait 10 minutes to play a shitty game like League.

You didnt need to have superpowers in order to know what was going to happen to this game once they hired him, tbh.\n\n\nI dont agree with the reasons you give to say that LoL is garbage now, but I do agree with the fact that LoL is garbage now.","replies":[]}]}
