After the first patch this season, my ping went up ( it still stays static every game), but the first game I play will have 49 ping, the second game will have 27, and that then repeats for however many games I play, back and forth. Nothing  has changed with my connection, firewall, etc. since that first patch, but it follows that pattern like clock work. What could be causing that?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-09T03:03:11.579+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What you're experiencing is most likely caused by an inconsistent or unreliable route to our servers.
