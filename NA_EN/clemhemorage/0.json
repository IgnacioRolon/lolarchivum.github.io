It said that my account had been logged in from somewhere else, and it logged me out of my account. I have never given my account info away to my friends or any sketchy websites so I was confused when it happened. Since then I haven&#039;t been able to log into my main account ClemHerm, the email I originally used to log into it isn&#039;t receiving the password reset messages so I haven&#039;t been able to get into my account. Because of this I used the riot support feature to make a case that I had trouble logging into my account. That was yesterday and I haven&#039;t heard back yet, I know it is the weekend and that they probably aren&#039;t at &quot;work&quot;. But I&#039;m only 16 and I have never experienced something like this and it scared me so much that I cried myself to sleep last night, because I got a job in order to buy skins in this game. I spent nearly 300$ on this game because it has given me so much enjoyment with friends and climbing ranked. I just want help to get my account back.","replies":[]}
