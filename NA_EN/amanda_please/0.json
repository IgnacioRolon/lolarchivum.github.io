He would make things just to see if he could. His mind would always be abuzz with interesting ideas. He just wanted to apply some principles that had been floating around in his brain for awhile. His new invention which he christened \"Feels-For-Heals MK.I\" was one of a kind.\n\nIt seemed to transfer injuries from one being to another. Needless to say, it create quite a bit of stir in the world of science. The medical applications were vast and he was approached by numerous respectable leaders in medical science.\nHowever, hospitals weren&#039;t the only ones after him. The military applications of his odd gadget could prove well for tortures and other unsavory things. He refused them all. He merely created things because he could and refused to let himself become some lapdog breaking through the barriers for science all for a pat on the head. His reluctance to fall under a banner disturbed many powerful people in many City-States. His mind was to great to be free. And so he was locked away in bowels of his beloved Piltover by those afraid of him. Of what he could make. \n\nIt was then the attack on Piltover happened. Buildings destroyed, chaos rampant. It created the diversion Rae needed to escape his isolation. When he emerged to see the smoking rubble of Piltover he finally saw what freed him. She was a glorious angel of freedom doing whatever she wanted. Flying high above the sky and decimating everything she touched with a smile on her face. He wanted to thank for bringing him back into the light. But most importantly he could see that she refused to be tethered as well. She was his kindred spirit. And so he watched this blue-haired angel and before he knew it he was running after her. He followed her trail all the way to the League Of Legends.\n\n\nRae uses a plethora of his own little gadgets to buff his allies and debuff his enemies\n\nPassive -\n**Helping Hand**: When casting an ability on an ally you increase their Lifesteal/SpellVamp by 8%/12%/14% for the next 2 Basic Attacks or abilities that apply on hit affects. Lasts 4 secs (Can only occur once every 4 seconds. Cd Starts after buff fades)\n\n**Q - Paint Em**(Skillshot Can hit creeps): 12/11/10/9/8 CD\n**[Passive]** - Your Basic attacks apply Assistance Required\nAssistance Required: You mark that enemy for 3 secs givin true sight on the unit. If attacked by an ally while marked they are also slowed by 20%/25%/30% for 1.5 seconds (diminishes over time) Also the slow and sight cannot be applied again for 3 secs after it diminishes.\n**[Active]** - Fire a targeting round that reduces enemy Armor and MR by 4%/6%/8%/10%/12% for 6 secs. Does 60/90/130/190/200(.5 Ap Ratio) Also applies Assistance Required\n\n**W - Baby Boom Boom** (Skillshot): 17/16/15/14/13 CD\nThrows a grenade a certain distance. Can be triggered to explode early. When it explodes it leaves behind a field that stays on the map for 4 secs. Enemies that walk in field are slowed for 30%. Also allies that walk through the field get the effects from Helping Hand! \nDeals 80/110/180/240/280 (.7 ap ratio)\n\n**E -Hyper Voice Modulator**(Skillshot cone/Does not hit creeps): 10 CD\nKinda wanted this skillshot to be like a cone much like annies W. Essentially Rae would pull out a microphone gadget invention he made and just scream out things. Somewhat motivational things.\n\n[On Ally cast] - Increases Attack Speed by 5%/10%/15%/20%/25%.\n[On Enemy cast] - Reduces AD/AP by 2%/3%/4%/5%/6% Deals 40/80/120/180/200\n(.5 Ap Ratio)\n\n**R - Life Alert:** 150/120/100 CD\nUses the experimental prototype weapon \"Feels-for-Heals Mk.II\" on a target ally. 20%/25%/30% dmg taken from the target of the spell is then\ntransfered to Rae. The weapon forms a link between the two and stays active for 5/6/7 secs. Every Kill the target gets increases the time by 1 sec. Assists increase it by half that. As long as the ult is active the target benefits from Helping Hand! The ult can be ended early if the distance between the two targets exceeds a certain amount. While ulted you and your target gain a boost to movement speed on kill or assist. (Small burst of speed. I wanna say 20% for 2 secs that diminish over time. Obviously half amount if assist)\n\nAs you could see he would essentially be a support that basically only did debuffs and buffs which i always thought was a cool concept. Also his passive allows for some super good sustain. His ult helps mitigate damage on a percentual (pretty sure im making words up now) basis but at the cost of his own health. While he doesn&#039;t do insane lockdown like other supports he does bring in some debuffs that directly decrease damage done which hardly any champions do. \nAlso he like idolizes {{champion:222}} \n\nAs per da usual for champ concepts id like feed back. Honestly i feel as though this champ would have trouble peeling a high engage team (zed, malph, etc) . Also hes ranged. He would probably not be very much fun to play and just pretty bland all around. Really the only fun thing about him would just be super buffing the adc and watching him just heal himself for bunches as well as take 30% less damage. Yah now that i envision it he would be pretty boring to play but hopefully pretty strong. And yes. he was inspired by tf2 medic\n\n\nQuotes: \n\n**Upon Selection**\n_Fight for your freedom.

He believes most authority figures are corrupted and are ruled by \"them.\" When Jinx freed him (Unintentionally) he saw her as his savior and an entity that fights the injustices commited by \"them.\" \n\nSo he's decided to follow her and help her in what he thinks is her Crusade against the truly evil. So he followed her to the League of Legends. He's actually never met her so he doesnt realize Jinx is just a sociopath who gets off on anarchy. \n","replies":[]}
