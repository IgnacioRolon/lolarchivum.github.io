I looked into this for you and it looks like you have a solid amount.  Are you on the updated client?  What happens if you check your balance on the legacy:\n\n-  On the login screen of the open beta updated client, look for the \"Launch Legacy Client\" text at the bottom.\n-  Or create a shortcut directly to the legacy client in your League Installation. Just look for \"lol.launcher\"\n\nI hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
