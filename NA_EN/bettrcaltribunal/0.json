Tried color blind mode but that doesn&#039;t help at all. There should be a way to change the color of the cursor so us people who have a hard time with colors could see it better. Every time in game I always lose the mouse cursor because my eyes have a hard time distinguishing between them.","replies":[{"poster":"Peritheus","date":"2018-01-12T08:24:15.894+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm, have you tried fiddling around with color in your computer screen settings, or increasing the hud size/ decreasing the resolution for a bigger hud, but smaller view area, I mean I'm not colorblind, but it does blow when they don't have all the right color blind option, just the generic one instead of your specific rare off 1.","replies":[{"poster":"Bettrcaltribunal","date":"2018-01-13T01:19:37.697+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea I pretty much have tried everything, if only they had an option to make the cursor different colors and size it would make a big difference for people like me who have vision problems.","replies":[{"poster":"Peritheus","date":"2018-01-13T10:19:04.441+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ayy just pryed up some info I got from a topic about small sized cursors, anyway \n\nWhat a hook (EUW)  - 4 months ago says\n > [{quoted}](name=What a hook ,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=OrxsKMBq,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2017-09-27T17:43:07.657+0000)\n>\n> Just enable color blind mode &gt; ok  then disable it again ,, it will reset the cursor ...\n> You are Welcome &lt;3\n\nand Elderly Woman (NA)  - 7 months ago says \n\n> [{quoted}](name=Elderly Woman,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=OrxsKMBq,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2017-06-25T18:28:33.228+0000)\n>\n> There is a fix.
