Pre 11 is the most boring shit I have ever seen. You have a Q that does shit damage, a heal that heals less than an auto attack, and a ranged auto attack that literally does nothing. \r\n\r\nShe can't top lane because bruisers will just push her out of lane, she can't mid because of snowballing assassins, she can't jg because she has shit clear speed and dies to almost every buff,  she can't support because her heal is less than a level 1 auto attack, and she can't ADC because every ADC is going to out range her and push her out of lane.","replies":[{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2019-03-06T22:24:44.916+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Kayle is supposed to have a weak as shit early game, since she becomes a godly hyper carry late game.
