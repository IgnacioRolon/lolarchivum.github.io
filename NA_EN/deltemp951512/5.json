They do it in a way to fly under the radar. If you mute them and mute pings they will start inting or they will follow and troll. They do everything they can to get people to retaliate and then they smash the report button. The victims get punished and they continue their trolling.","replies":[{"poster":"Imperial Pandaa","date":"2018-11-07T04:21:55.401+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RoG Seraph,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=6vvV6zob,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2018-11-07T03:52:54.779+0000)\n>\n> Riot doesn&#x27;t give a shit about details. \n\nYet they reverted bans from the \"bait banning\" incident a while back.\n\n> \n> This is their main goal is to get someone to retaliate so they can report.

If they are trying to get you to say certain phrases, then don't. Obviously you are smart enough to recognize it. If you somehow failed to realize it, then support ticket and maybe it gets fixed.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Sett a trap","date":"2018-11-07T14:33:52.340+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can just reverse troll them by role playing lux.
