It would be nice to see them use different color particles for this mastery chromas.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HeartseekerVarus","date":"2017-02-08T23:56:11.362+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A blueskinned mastery chroma for Varus would make my year, as far as LoL.\n{{champion:110}} \n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}} \n\nNo (but also yes), but really, mastery chromas would be awesome! It certainly would give some extra incentive to master characters, and make people wonder what (mystery?) chroma they'd receive with mastery of x character -- which could possibly lead to more drive to buy x, y, or z character?\n\nI dunno.

So, it's kind of like knowing you are getting a present for your birthday and all you want is a puppy, but yours parents get you a goldfish. It's a pet, just not one you really wanted.
