It is not a hard thing to do.\n\nBanning in waves every now and then still allows the people selling the accounts to sell them before they are banned.

Then the botmakers tweak things a bit, and send out a new wave of bots. They get banned again right away, botmakers go okay that didn't work, maybe I'll try this. Now they got it right. Riot can't detect that bot for a while until they come up with new ways to detect them. Now they're stuck in an eternal dance of getting caught, tweaking systems, putting out new bots.  It's thousands of people seeking easy profit versus one company. You need to look at it realistically. Chances are, you actually know nothing about how bots work and how they're detected, but you don't look at the world realistically and you want every problem fixed for you. That's fine. But much like real life, there isn't always a fix.\n\nWhat Riot does, is tracks the sites that sell these botted accounts. It's like a drug sting. They will let them go until they lock em down and find an opportunity to get legal on em. They sue them. They shut down entire operations. Not just individual accounts.  But please, tell the multimillion dollar company how to handle these matters. Please help them.","replies":[{"poster":"deltemp951512","date":"2018-08-07T15:40:23.499+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Telephone Booth,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=WevWNsTt,comment-id=000100000001,timestamp=2018-08-07T05:16:15.258+0000)\n>\n> \nThey will let them go until they lock em down and find an opportunity to get legal on em.
