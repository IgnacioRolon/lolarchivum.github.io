I know the servers were attacked last week but what is causing the ping spikes now? I have not got into a game yet that I have been under 300 ping. It goes from 300-2k ping and I have heard the same thing going on with other people as well.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-20T22:22:38.778+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like there may be issues going on with your network routing to the server.

I am downloading the repair tool to see if that works. What should I do if nothing else works?

I sit around 40-50 ping for some amount of time - ranging from 30 minutes, to 30 seconds - only to get interrupted by pingspikes; sometimes up to 80, sometimes up to 60, sometimes 500 and even 5000. I have done multiple tests, and talked with my ISP, only to do some settings configuration - and then have no improvement. The tests that Riot told me to run said that I was experiencing some bad packet loss and bandwith issues, but those seem to come and go, and are nearly independent of my spikes; I've had 30 ping in the red of the test, and 5000 ping when it all comes back green. This is all very frustrating to me, too.","replies":[]}]}
