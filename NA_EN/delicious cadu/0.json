My ping hasn't changed at all but during the games I've been struggling with delays, the ones we get when we have high ping, eventually making my champ stop responding and just stand still for a couple of seconds and/or dc'ing me. Well, I'm from Brazil and play on the NA server because my gaming friends are all americans, so I tried playing on the Brazilian server and no problem, no lag, no delay at all. Hopefully you understand what I mean and have a way to help me out. Thank you in advance.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-27T00:18:47.516+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What you're most likely experiencing are bursts of *Packet Loss* or high packet buffering.

I won't underestimate it, so thanks for the help.\n\nFrom all the options it showed me, I set my firewall to let LoL do its thing (I've never had a problem but maybe..) and I configurated the dns.\nI couldn't do the other opitions, such as packet loss check because apparently chrome doesn't support Java anymore and it won't let me actually find the \"start analysis\" buttom.\n\nBut hey, I've played a game with no lag/delay just now, so I assume something has indeed changed.\n\nThanks again for your help.","replies":[]}]}]}
