And then in the case you guys really think its game breaking for jungle nidalee just nerf how much damage she does to monsters instead of hurting lane nid?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shadow Hazard","date":"2017-01-17T22:20:50.813+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is there going to be any looks into kindred.
