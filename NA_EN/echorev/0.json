Why is does it seem impossible for people to understand some people just WANT to ban none? And that it is nothing against the team, it isnt to helping the enemy team, heck people seem to not realize that the more picks they have, the same number of picks YOU have.\n\nThats what i dont get. How fo people not understand this simple of a concept?","replies":[{"poster":"ninjaroxas","date":"2018-07-09T09:09:39.858+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is no reason to not ban champion unless it's accidental. It does help the enemy by giving them more of a chance to counter pick.\n\nCan you even give me an actual reason not to ban a champion? Doing it just because isn't a good reason btw.\n\nIf you don't want to ban a champ then why not say \"hey instead of possibly hurting our chances of winning by not banning anyone, does anyone want me to ban a champ for them?\"","replies":[{"poster":"Silly Neeko","date":"2018-07-09T11:20:18.894+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"1) it adds a champion to your, and your allies champ pool as well. Giving chances to counterpick against them.\n\n2) it reduces the chance that you have someone rage at you because you banned their 1 trick and they start trolling and running it down mid. You made a comment about \"thats on them for not paying attention\" however, the only thing that is on them is they banned a champ that the enemy could have picked up before them as well....\n\n3) with new champs especially.... it gives people a chance to actually PLAY the new champ and try to learn it. Some play exclusively ranked, and it also gives the chance that Riot can collect the information they need to buff or nerf certain aspects.\n\n4) it reduces the urge for some people to purposefully ban someone elses pick. People complain enough about the none ban that at least there is less people banning your picks just because you tried being friendly or nice or whatever to them in chat or whatever the heck goes on with some people.\n\n5) it can be used as a bit of an intimidation factor, because you didnt ban a champ, that means you know the matchups fairly decently, which means you might choose a different champion than you originally thought.... or you might play safer against them because you dont know how they will be to fight...\n\nAll of these things are just as valid as the arguements brought up against the non ban. It actually shoes a side of all of those arguements that people dont seem to understand....\n\nYou picked none, that gives your team just as much of an advantage as they get.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
