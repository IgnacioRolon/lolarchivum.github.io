That is 205% more healing done with FoL proc than what the Kayle build was offering.\nWith one less item.\n\nThat said, if the rune would heal both champions, the one procing and the one marking, it would actually have some value to others than Soraka.\n\nNow 100-150 HPs, or even 250 with perfect Soraka situation, is one basic attacks worth of HPs from someone that has zero damage builded. That is done over four seconds time while everyone can surely make more than one basic attack in that time, even Graves would do five.
