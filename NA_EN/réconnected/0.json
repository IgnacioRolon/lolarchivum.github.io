Issues that occur with latency (ping) are generally caused by something on your local network or along your route that causes your connection to take a longer route to the server. Working through our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) would be my strongest recommendation since this guide often resolves these issues.\n\nLet me know if this helped.","replies":[{"poster":"Réconnected","date":"2016-12-13T01:09:22.937+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thanks! also,  can you re roll a champion permanent with 2 other champion shards?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-13T22:07:54.405+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yup, you can.
