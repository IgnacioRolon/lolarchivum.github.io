I honestly don't understand why Dyrus stays with TSM, they've made it clear they give no fucks about him and he's usually left out to dry in most games by Bjergson and Santorin. I will digress, its been slightly better recently. \n\nThis is further exacerbated by teams knowing this which is why they gank him so aggressively, especially in early game, since they know there won't be any retaliation from them unless Santorin happens to be around for a free kill.\n\nThis is why they did so poorly in MSI, TSM tries to play a control game while not giving a shit about Dyrus against Korean teams, whom are notorious for aggressive game play, that was just a recipe for disaster. \n\nGank Dyrus repeatedly, even when he's under the tower, get someone fed off those kills and its GG from there.
