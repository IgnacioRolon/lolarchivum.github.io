They truly are unique, both in looks and in mechanics as well for that matter.\n\nTahm moves just like a huge, XXXL size gentleman would (which he is) and his running animation is just blissful to watch. He&#039;s just the right mix between something menacing and something hilarious.\n\nBard seems like something out of a Ghibli movie (I guess he&#039;s inspired from one of those?). With no lines, just humming and noises he always seems like a mistery. His joyful hopping around seems to fit with the \"out of this world\" balance/nature preserving theme. Now that I think about it, kinda reminds me of Tom Bombadil too.\n\nI also like Tahm&#039;s quotes, although they could be a bit darker sometimes. Still, his manner of speaking is something I quite enjoy, with the starting line of \"This buffet exceeds repugnance!\" being probably my favorite.\n\nAll in all, whoever desinged them, just want to say, I really like your work man!\n\nEdit: When I pick a champion to play, I don't really care about how powerful or how \"meta\" they are. What I look at is how much would I enjoy being these characters for many games to come, and do I like like their personalities? These two guys were love at first site.","replies":[{"poster":"Qarekeo","date":"2015-07-24T21:59:53.207+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"What's funny is that they're both extremely mobile supports who had tough releases, but they have great aesthetics to them both.\n\nI don't think Bard is bad now and Tahm is getting buffs, so I wouldn't worry so much about their gameplay now.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Alljoy","date":"2015-07-24T16:35:13.051+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tahm's movements and mannerisms remind me of the Millenium Earl from D.Gray-Man.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Leu07","date":"2015-07-24T09:20:20.097+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like them very much too!
