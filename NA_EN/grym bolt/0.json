Sometimes when I play a champion that has an ability that is easier to use without quick cast,  I&#039;ll go to play a different champion and forgot that I had set this before, and it will sometimes cost me my life, or a kill. So I think that having something that will save key bindings and quick cast to a champion, rather than having it be universal for all. I know there is and argument to change it at the beginning of the match, but sometimes it just slips a players mind.","replies":[{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2016-11-02T22:51:30.294+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That would be good, but one thing you could do is use smart cast with indicator instead. The way it works is that pressing the key will smart cast, and holding it will bring up the indicator like normal cast. That way you'll have both worlds. \n\nBecause my ping is pretty high as it is I don't like the small delay so I only use smartcast, but it's worth a try.","replies":[]}]}
