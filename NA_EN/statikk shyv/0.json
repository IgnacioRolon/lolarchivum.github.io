Is there any way he can receive a mail from you on another address so he can find out on which mail he made his account?\r\n\r\nHe can login and play without using his email, but he wants to change his password and he can't because he forgot his email address.\r\n\r\nIs there any way to recover his email or is there another way to change his password?\r\n\r\nThank you!","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Privately","date":"2015-09-03T09:16:41.853+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To protect the security of an account we don't typically share that information.\nThere _might _ be a workaround, but I can't make a promise.\n\nHave your bother send in a [Player Support request](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and message me with your case number; I'll be happy to take a look.","replies":[]}]}
