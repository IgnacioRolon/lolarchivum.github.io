I'd like to go into more detail.\n\nThe key to beating a Yasuo in lane is proper minion management, and proper management is different depending on whether you're a ranged or melee champion. As a ranged champion, you want to keep the wave in 1 of 2 places depending on Yasuo's health relative to yours. If Yasuo is ahead or even, you want to keep the wave frozen a bit outside of your own tower, so that he has to go into tower range to order to hit you. You can basically do whatever you want to him if the wave is in this spot because you can simply retreat into tower range if he tries to go onto you. However, if you're ahead of him in health, you want to start a slow push, so you can poke him whenever he tries to CS and you'll have a buffer of minion support if he tries to all in you. In this case, he can't do much either.\n\nFor a melee champion, you want to slow push pretty much all the time. Yasuo is extremely vulnerable to being all inned by melee champions when he's trying to CS, and a good Yasuo will try to do a slow push of his own to discourage his opponent from attacking him. One important thing to understand is that while enemy minions are oftentimes Yasuo's best friends since he uses them to dash, they are also one of his biggest weaknesses since he's required to tank them in order to trade. If you can bait him into tanking a lot of minions with some kind of defensive ability like an ori shield, you can very easily come out ahead in trades, provided you don't panic, keep autoing, and hit some extra free damage on him when he tries to get out.\n\nGenerally speaking, a Yasuo will always want the wave in 1 of 2 places. He either wants a slight minion advantage on his side so he can get free opportunities to poke with Q, but not so many more minions that the wave gets frozen outside the enemy tower. A good Yasuo will bait you into hitting minions with AOE abilities to push the wave back towards him if it starts to get too close to tower, allowing him to be aggressive again. The other position is for when Yasuo has a lead on his opponent; he will want to freeze outside of his tower, leaving a long trail of minions to dash through so he can all in you if you try to walk up to CS. The key to beating Yasuo is to keep the wave where you want it to be rather than the way he wants it to be, or there's not a whole lot you can do as a lot of champions.\n\nOther general tips for beating Yasuo include: Ask for ganks, an aggressive Yasuo player is very easy to bait and kill if he isn't strong enough to 1v2 already. Take exhaust as a combat summoner if your kill pressure on him is low, it’s a great way to neutralize his aggression in lane as well as neuter him in teamfights. If Yasuo misses his tornado, that is the time to be aggressive. His Q is on CD, he has no CC for a while, and his ult, by extension, is unavailable. And if Yasuo gets too aggressive in lane and messes up when trying to trade, all in him right then and there. If you get a lead against Yasuo, most champions will be able to zone him out heavily since he's a squishy melee only champion with no escape and no natural sustain.","replies":[{"poster":"Vistha Kai","date":"2016-09-19T17:29:20.493+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't waste your time.\nRegardless of how logical and idiot-proof your explanations are going to be, they will still refuse to acknowledge any of them.","replies":[{"poster":"oSEXYPLATYPUSo","date":"2016-09-19T18:06:28.637+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"and people still want to refuse that yasou kit is slightly over powered still and needs a tuning","replies":[{"poster":"Vistha Kai","date":"2016-09-19T18:49:31.124+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah, we should remove his untargetability.\nIt's so OP.\n\nWould you kindly educate yourself, before talking to me?","replies":[{"poster":"oSEXYPLATYPUSo","date":"2016-09-19T18:59:54.987+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"sorry i cant im a retarded troll with no hope who is HIGH \n\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"Vistha Kai","date":"2016-09-19T19:17:29.618+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Trolling assumes you are doing it on purpose.\n\nThe rest checks out.","replies":[{"poster":"oSEXYPLATYPUSo","date":"2016-09-19T19:46:11.600+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"oh cuz i have an opinion im retarded cuz its not the same as yours ok","replies":[{"poster":"Vistha Kai","date":"2016-09-19T19:55:29.785+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Did I actually say something like that?\n\nYou're bashing yourself at this point.","replies":[{"poster":"oSEXYPLATYPUSo","date":"2016-09-19T19:59:08.063+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"oh im just doing what you and every one else likes to do... insult people. when i never insulted anyone on here","replies":[{"poster":"Vistha Kai","date":"2016-09-19T20:10:45.568+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Excuse me, but I'm not calling anybody \"a retarded troll\".","replies":[{"poster":"oSEXYPLATYPUSo","date":"2016-09-19T20:29:03.239+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Vistha Kai,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=5bI2Kbiw,comment-id=00000001000000000000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2016-09-19T20:10:45.568+0000)\n>\n> Excuse me, but I&#x27;m not calling anybody &quot;a retarded troll&quot;.\n\njust implying it and agreeing with it ok thanks for clearing that up","replies":[{"poster":"Vistha Kai","date":"2016-09-19T20:35:26.784+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nice try, but I denied.","replies":[{"poster":"oSEXYPLATYPUSo","date":"2016-09-19T20:37:57.723+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Vistha Kai,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=5bI2Kbiw,comment-id=0000000100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2016-09-19T20:35:26.784+0000)\n>\n> Nice try, but I denied.\n\ndenied what ?","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Dabrick01","date":"2016-09-19T18:15:32.346+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yep, his windwall will still block all your team's ults if they are stupid enough to unload them all onto Yas.
