I can play fine and win/lose games up til promos then it devolves into all the shittiest league situations. I don&#039;t want to be paired with AFK and Ragers when its finally a game that matters, but my personal experience is just that. \r\n\r\nNow I&#039;m learning that scripters/mods save their uses for those games. So I&#039;ve been frustrated and searching for legitimate answers only to discover scripts/mods are high in usage during (surprise) the promotional games that matter. My honest practice and skill has no real testability in a situation where my opponent has a hidden advantage of mods. And what of my unsuspecting allies? The ones who are stomped by the cheat and are just too ignorant to know the other is cheating?\r\n\r\nAlso, all you high level smurf boosters. You&#039;re crooked as shit. F how much you&#039;re getting paid, you&#039;re ruining things people love to test their ACTUAL skill on. You don&#039;t provide any legitimate service to the overall game we love. You&#039;re shammers, opportunistic cheaters and degrading the spirit of sport. Your customers are just as guilty for taking the easy way to a level of play they cannot maintain. You hinder and shame all the legitimate players who didn&#039;t pay for it except for their own time and dedication. You don&#039;t belong where you&#039;ve been boosted, despite your feelings. You&#039;re deadweight\r\n\r\nLets make league honest please","replies":[{"poster":"ChimeraDragon22","date":"2016-09-30T23:19:21.668+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I started playing League about two years ago, and I LOVE this game more than any I've ever played. I wouldn't go out and call myself a 'big gamer' but you get my point. Anyways, the reason I initially quit was because my computers graphics just can't keep up anymore and I can't afford to get a new one. However to make up for not being able to play, I would watch my boyfriend play (I played on his comp every now and then).\nIt was all great, but I haven't played in MONTHS. Not because of my comp, not because I've come to hate the game. But because of the massive smurffing, scrpiting, etc. I haven't had the desire.\nI'm not even close to being good, and I don't feel like I can even try to seriously practice this game because of this. I never go against Bronzies in Bronze games. It's always a one or two Bronzies and then Plat smurfs.\nI'm Bronze.\nI don't want to play against Plats that are just going to degrade me for being in Bronze.\nLet me learn Fairly if youre not going to help.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PayaThePapaya","date":"2016-09-30T20:39:32.502+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I smurf pretty much nonstop and out of the thousands of games I've played, I've only met one person who I thought was scripting and even then it was hard to tell. \nI've never really had difficulty with my promos but I'll admit it's a smurf fest.

But most smurfs in promos are still pretty low ranking, I rarely run into people I actually have trouble defeating\n\nIf you smurf a lot, im not surprised. I get there's nothing wrong with a fresh account to test your skills, but I don't think its good outweighs the bad anymore. Smurfing on someone else's account, or for the purpose of boosting/ selling accounts is probably the reason why smurfing should stop altogether.\n\nIf you're a plat player smurfing in silver or are good enough to \"rarely run into people (you) actually have trouble defeating\" and in are in a lower elo promo, thats really fucking unfair to me and any other player not that good yet.\n\nI'm in rank trying to see if I can earn the rank, not pay for it or have some other guy do it for me. I deserve fair competition to test against. I don't deserve the sheer beatdown of a player 2 divisions higher than me as the obstacle for me to climb 1 tier in my own division. Its fucking ridiculous.\n\nJust think about it. I'm not as good as you, and I won 4 straight games to get in promos, and then play 2 games in a row with smurfs in it, I've failed promos. What are the chances that any of those smurfs are going to be helping me in a constructive manner while they're winning with better knowledge/mechanics? Very fucking little my friend. This is league. Its usually just insults and \"haha I wins\" from the smurfs after game. Followed by them taunting other players to quit cuz they suck.","replies":[{"poster":"GayFluffyUnicorn","date":"2016-10-01T11:17:40.942+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well welcome to our world just the other way round: lots of players paying to get into my tier and ruining games because they suck donkey balls.\nYou then get frustrated and go on your smurf and stomp lower elos. \nOnce you get rid of boosters and excessive queue times smurfing will go down.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Bruised Ego","date":"2016-10-01T14:28:28.519+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think scripting is kinda rare, especially after the recent ban-wave that Riot did.

They want you and all your friends playing the game so your invested in it, and that means you will spend money on it.\n\nYes, I can accept losing some games in a series/promos. It happens. What I dont understand is how the fucking professional trolls that are streaming to their deranged troll fan audience seem to keep getting shuffled into those matches... then normal assholes, like people who call you trash, baddie, dumb, etc come back out after I lose a series. Then I get back into the series and here come the asshats that abandon a lane to come to mine just to stand under the turret...\n\nI dont understand it... unless Riot is really trying to compel me to play with a premade to avoid this.\n\nIv been up to my series for Silver 3 twice now. In my last match that lost it for me, we had a player that threatened to feed because I was playing Bard... I mean what the fuck!? What insane bullshit is this game that we have players in matches that can say \"Youre Bard, so Im going to feed then AFK.\" Sadly its NORMAL BY NOW to see these morons come out of the woodwork for my series/promos.\n\nSo yes OP. I am noticing it. I swear Im getting gatekeepers dispatched to me on purpose to make me have to go through every series/promo at least twice to move on. Its not that Im getting crushed by some massive opposing skill level team, its that I often have teammates that have died 4 times in 8 minutes and decide \"fuck it, going for double digit deaths cause I didnt get a gank!\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"FortisDominus","date":"2016-10-01T09:01:47.106+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had a game where someone said to give them jungle in a high plat game when I was in my promos or they would run it down mid 20 times.

Simply put, nobody fed! If we lost it was because of decisions or team comps but not because someone on a team fed. It was amazing. I got into my promos... \n\nAnd the next two games I had intentional feeders. One was mad the enemy team banned his jungler (he was in promos he said) and began to feed. The next game is just mind boggling but I had a premade 3 man. I was a support for the ADC in that premade and she got a quadra kill. I said \"Good job, Ashe!\" and she started saying things like \"fuck off\" and \"fuck you\" and began to feed. Her premades would say in all chat \"report Janna\" and \"Ashe isn't toxic at all i don't know what janna is talking about.\" \n\nSince then I've taken a week break and today I played two more games that have had feeders in them. Probably done with league this season. But it's really weird that across 31 games, 6 had trolls/feeders/AFKs in them, and out of those 6? Four were in my placements and promos. I'd also like to add 6/31 of my games had trolls or feeders or AFKs in them. That's sorta ridiculous. That's 20%!

Maybe trolls screw around during their own promos? Maybe it's to make sure they _don't_ progress to the next rank/league?
