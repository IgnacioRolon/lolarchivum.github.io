It really doesn't feel like your matchmaking system is fair and the punishment system is doing it's job. There are players that are ruining games and wasting our time. I climbed myself out of Iron and really play my heart out. I did the same thing on another account and climbed myself out of elo he**. It was just as bad then as well.  I play this game to have fun and I play ranked to have fun in a competitive atmosphere. I have the highest vision score, I built around my team and I played for my team. I played my favorite champion and a lot of us were better than the other team. It really shouldn't come down to the enemy adc being so behind and being able to catch up because our ADC decided to afk half way through the game and come back to only go afk and permanently leave the game, then come back but die and then afk and leave again.\n\nWe were ahead. I carried my botlane and our mid/jungle/and top lane did great. Even the adc was good. I don't understand why players like the Kasai are allowed to have the privilege to play ranked and basically go unscathed from punishment when she was the legit reason the game dragged on for almost an hour and the enemy team was able to catch up. She was afk for almost 30 mins and then came back to go fight with us and then afk again after she died.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/wa6AH3Q\n\nI would love a Riot Employee to actually talk about their one sided punishment system that seems to punish the innocent players as opposed to the ones that are getting away with murder. If she didn't want to play the game and go afk, then she shouldn't have qued into the match. I've played almost 70+ ranked games the past week and it's almost every game someone is doing this. This game shouldn't be this stressful to play and this hard to try and enjoy. Do your jobs and start banning some of these players that are getting away with murder.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightsky Pirate","date":"2019-10-24T07:16:27.497+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Pointing out the {{item:2421}} but with no {{item:3157}}\nHaving been punished for false AFKs (which I will do only once in a few dozen games when subjected to extreme toxicity), due to a discord issue, ISP shoddiness, Firefox letting a webpage hog system resources or whatever, I can say that arbitrarily long que times is a huge disincentive to play again, let alone pay, when I was hardly at fault. In my case, it was only a handful of unfortunate games that weren't long apart, but I quit for months after the soft-ban.","replies":[]}]}
