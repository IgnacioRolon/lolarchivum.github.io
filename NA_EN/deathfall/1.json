Offically Leaving Game.","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":7,"down_votes":18,"body":"I knew Riot Games was going to give Ezreal the mini VGU. I called it months ago after I heard about it. You want to know why? Years ago I made a comment to Meddler saying Karma&#039;s VGU put her in an even worse spot that the majority of the Karma community is not happy with. This was several years ago and Meddler made the ridiculous comment that Ezreal needed a VGU before Karma. The majority of us were very upset with him at the time and I never forgot what he said. From that day I knew it was going to happen because they went out of their way to work on art assets for Lux last year and it was only a matter of time before Ezreal was made a top priority. \n\nI am not going to sit here and say Karma is more worthy of a VGU than a lot of champions right now, but I am going to say that she and many other champions needed a VGU or deserved a mini VGU before Ezreal. Ezreal has an identity in this game, he has a fully conceptualized theme, outdated but completed VO, and other things. Yes, Ezreal needs a new W and a new model. Unfortunately we have champions, like Karma, who received a horrible, rushed, and incomplete VGU 5 years ago. This Development team has used excuse after excuse to do nothing on Karma for the past 5 years. It took this Development team 5 years to work on her directionless and bland kit, to probably accomplish absolutely nothing when it does come out in a few weeks. The decision and ridiculous comments made by Developers like Reav3 and Meddler saying that a champion like Ezreal needs a prioritized mini VGU and deserves it over champions like Karma, Morde, Pantheon, Malzahar, Skarner, all the Yordles, or Shaco is ridiculous.\n\nI have lost all respect for this Development team as content creators. I will not give a single dime to them ever again, I will not provide my love and admiration for their work ethic and game, and I will not spend the next 5 years trying to advocate work for champions like Karma, Morde, Pantheon, Malzahar and many others. I just cannot do it anymore. You say you care about all of your champions but in the end you have yet to show it. You have purposely messed up and failed the mark on a lot of these champions that the actual mains are not happy with. You have blatantly ignored so many problems and champions that need obvious work to do work on champions like Ahri, Lux, Ezreal, Jinx and other popular ones because that is what aligns with your favoritism. The argument that one champion is marketable compared to another is irrelevant. This Development team has the resources, creativity and time to put as much work as they want to in any champion to make them more marketable and popular. This Development team just keeps doing it for the same champions every year and creating content for them every single year. It&#039;s to the point that no one can no longer stand it when their champion gets ignored for 5 years and is told that a champion like Ezreal deserves a rushed mini-VGU because he is more popular and needs a new W.\n\nKarma has no running and shield casting animation, her splash art does not match her in-game model, her original model 5 years ago was rushed and is completely different from what it was supposed to be, she has a directionless and bland identity and kit, she has no relevant or existing thematic that anyone can pinpoint, her lore is still bland but acceptable because it is vastly better than the hack-job you did before, and lastly Karma has the most pathetic VO and taunts in this game because it doesn&#039;t match up with her new lore or it already exists on a champion. Shen dance much?\n\nI&#039;m done. You no longer have the respect and admiration I had for you, Riot. You choosing to do a mini VGU on a champion like Ezreal is the most ridiculous and proof of favoritism I have ever seen from game Developers. When you think that champions like Karma, Morde, Pantheon, Malzahar, Skarner, all the Yordles, or Shaco doesn&#039;t deserve a mini VGU before Ezreal is very insulting and mind boggling. I&#039;m not dealing with it anymore.\n\nThe excuse that &quot;Karma was the very first VGU in LoL history, there are other champions that need a VGU before Karma, we just don&#039;t have the time and resources to put money and work into Karma anymore, and Karma needs a VGU.&quot; These are all things that you guys have said for the past 5 years and excuses as to why the work you did 5 years ago is acceptable to be ignored for an Ezreal VGU. No, it&#039;s favoritism. I wasn&#039;t even expecting Karma to get it. I was really hoping Shaco or another Yordle was going to get the mini VGU. Instead you give it to the one champion I knew all along was going to get it.\n\nI said if Ezreal is getting the mini VGU I was going to be done with the game for good and I am keeping that promise. As we speak I am going to be having all 17 of my accounts locked to never play this game again. I was hopeful for the Karma rework but I cannot support this Development team knowing that is it going to be half-arsed work on her and other champions.  I am happy for the Ezreal mains that are excited about this. I am happy for the players that wanted this for the champion. I am disappointed that for the past 5 years I, and many other mains of their favorite champions, have been so active in trying to get things done on not just Karma but other champions, to in the end have another popular champion get something done on them. If you know your work ethic and choices ruined a champion, you don&#039;t ignore the problem. You sit here and rectify your mistakes and make it better. I cannot say that about a lot of things in this game. 2019 is the mini Lux VGU so just prepare for it.\n\n(I can respect your decision to down-vote but I would appreciate if you didn't.

I have talked with incompetent Developers like Meddler and Reav3 for the past 5 years about how much damage they did on Karma and champions like Morde, to be told that champions like Ezreal matter. You are delusional if you think Ezreal deserves a rushed mini VGU before champions like Karma, Morde, Skarner and many others.\n\nSo you are saying a model that was made incomplete with horrible decisions and no communication between the Karma mains is acceptable? You are saying incomplete animations is acceptable? You are saying that her theme, art, and kit are unique to the game? You are saying a champion like Karma is so great and amazing that the work they did on her 5 years ago is complete and fully conceptualized?

No. I don't think she deserves a visual update over a lot of champions, but Ezreal isn't one of them.

I just cannot support a Development team that cares about the same champions every year. They just don't care. It has reached a point in the past 5 years that amass to this. It's just a pile up of hate, disdain and ignorance towards this Development team that I just don't want to deal with anymore. I just don't like them as a company and I am just going to whine, complain, moan and groan until it is out of my system and I purge this game for good.\n\nI'm one of the more active, and rude at sometimes and controversial Karma mains since the relaunch, and I am just done. I am just tired of creating threads to be ignored, I am tired of zero communication, I am tired of seeing the same content and reworks being create for popular champions, and just don't care anymore. This is what this Development team wanted so I am out and will be gone in a few days for good.\n\nPlease stay active, kind, patient and be an advocate for this champion. You are on of the good ones that the Karma community needs fighting for her.","replies":[{"poster":"IxtaliKing","date":"2018-08-07T20:14:47.191+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm really sorry to hear that. \n\nI know over the past 5 years Riot has been absolutely terrible in regards to Karma, but if you take a step back and look at it - they're at least trying now.\n\nSo while I do get where you're coming from and your frustration, you're only looking at what they've done wrong, and most of that stuff is in the past. Back then Karma wasn't spoken about by Rioters, questions were always ignored and seemingly no consideration was taken. Nowadays they don't avoid her; Meddler has been answering mine and many other Karma mains questions directly for months and he's even assigned a fan of OLD Karma to work with the community on her rework.\n\n> Please stay active, kind, patient and be an advocate for this champion.
