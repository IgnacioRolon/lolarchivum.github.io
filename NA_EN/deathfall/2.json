It's a Excuse To Be Toxic.","subforum":"General Discussion","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"Riot wants to promote this game as a team oriented game where you play as a team to win. It's not the case at all. It's getting worse and worse with all these new players that just cannot keep their personality and competitive attitudes in check. I can play in a solo lane/support role and carry the game but it means nothing when I have a toxic ADC that ints and ruins player morale with his mouth all game. I can do amazingly well in the game and try my best to have fun and enjoy playing with others, but 90% of the players that I don't know are the most toxic individuals in any game I've played with. It really takes a lot to get me upset and running your mouth and blaming others and then rage quitting, is not doing anyone any good. I would love to keep the chat on and have fun with new friends, but no one can do that anymore. Players need to be removed from the game if they cannot keep their emotions in check and if they are ruining the game for others. Sorry, Riot. This is not a team game because if it was a team game, my entire team would be playing the game instead of running their mouths, feeding, spamming the surrender vote when the match can be won, and then rage quitting. I think the vast majority of the playerbase is over the game because of the toxicity. There isn't a single game that doesn't have a toxic player and someone who disconnects constantly. It's ridiculous.","replies":[]}
