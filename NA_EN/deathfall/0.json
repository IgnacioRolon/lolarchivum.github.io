What&#039;s the point in playing anymore? I do my best, be nice, play the game and just be a team player. You get so far ahead and everyone else gets so far ahead, that your teammates sit there and just don&#039;t want to play anymore because the &quot;game is boring&quot;. So these players feed, int and are toxic on purpose. This is allowed in games. In Riot&#039;s eyes these players really are important.\r\n\r\nIf the Wukong says, &quot;Wait, we have a Xeyah? I didn&#039;t know we had a Xeyah.&quot; The guy is 23 kills and hardly any deaths but he is &quot;so bored&quot; that he goes into 1vs4 fights on purpose to feed and annoy players. The Quinn is 20 something kills and hardly any deaths but she doesn&#039;t want to group up because she is &quot;so bored&quot;. What&#039;s the point in playing anymore Riot? The community on the boards says its okay for people to do this. You think it is okay for people to do this. Why don&#039;t I just que into a game and just ruin it for everyone else? The entire community thinks this is acceptable behavior. Let&#039;s all be toxic and ruin the game for everyone else.","replies":[{"poster":"Evangele","date":"2018-07-19T04:36:56.493+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:267}} Locking thread at request of OP.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Imperial Pandaa","date":"2018-07-18T04:02:51.265+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"The community doesn't think it is acceptable behavior though.","replies":[{"poster":"Deathfall","date":"2018-07-18T04:05:29.260+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"Yeah.

That is what you're trying to say. Someone having a bad game, then leaving that game, and being toxic in chat **does not make them a troll who gets an immediate and escalated punishment**. They will be at risk for punishment for their AFK/leave, as well as for their toxic behavior, but that does not make them a troll.","replies":[{"poster":"Deathfall","date":"2018-07-18T04:25:01.489+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"So me venting and being upset about people deliberately doing this is not acceptable?

It is punishable because in this ELO that I am playing ranked games in, they are doing it every single game. I went out of my way to do this just for you, moron. The community you defend and the community you are sitting here advocating for, is not worth your time. Stop saying these players don't deserve to be punished. Stop saying these players are not the problem but players like me are. These guys qued into match and griefed, dced the entire game, fed, harassed other players who just shouldn't be acting like this in ranked games. The punishment system doesn't stop them from doing it once and ruining games. The punishment system either doesn't pinpoint it because players are smart enough to fool it or the system takes almost 100+ games to hand out a punishment to players that should have had at least a chat restriction in a game.\n\nIn your eyes, it is players like me who are the problem and try to play this game. A lot of how I am acting right now is because the past 4 games in ranked I have played have all been extremely toxic because of other players.
