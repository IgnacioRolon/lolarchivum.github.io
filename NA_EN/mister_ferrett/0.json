If Varus gets a kill or an assist, his attack speed passive (living vengeance) shows up and his bow starts to glow. What if timer of his passive only starts to run at the first auto attack. This would make Varus a great ADC for teamfight snowballing.\r\nMost of the time when the passive activates on Varus, I couldn&#039;t use it because the timer is just a few seconds, not long enough to make good use out of it.\r\n\r\n2. Mana % refund on popping 3 blight stacks.\r\n\r\n3. Popping 3 blight stacks empowers the abilities on Varus. Bonus slow on E  ...% per stack\r\n\r\n4.

Gut reaction is some degree of nerf, mid lane&#x27;s pretty messy though at present so not leaping to conclusions.\n\nHeyo. I've been playing around with the new items for AD Caster Varus and I've noticed a big core issue.\n\n- Youmuu's  and the other lethality items are still fine as a steroid for Varus' scaling AD. However the only real reason to grab them on him now is primarily to have increased movement speed for an escape. He still scales off during the mid - late stages, and the lethality over flat armour penetration in my opinion and experience make him less of a threat than he used to be. He still has early lane dominance during the early but his off-scaling is far more noticeable once the mid game starts picking up. I'd have to get into auto attack range to be a threat at all from mid- late game phases. The item changes have pretty much been a soft nerf to him and his mid game presence. Now obviously to experienced players with Varus it wouldn't be too hard to do well since you just have to sit back and hit Peircing Arrow. You'll still delete most ADC's in a couple of shots but that's to be expected. It's less of a threat to more HP / armoured champions than it used to be. Even when I'm hitting Q's at late game to gain a poke advantage the damage is still mitigated, even from a direct hit. Squishies will still get destroyed if they're hit, that's a given.  If anything Varus will become more of a Flex Pick for mid lane than before, primarily for his CC ult.\n\n- I think the improved passive will definitely benefit auto-attack based builds. Combined with the incoming Guinsoo's change it might shift his power as a bot lane auto attacker.  GR, RH and BoRK might become his meta botlane build and probably improve his standing versus other ADCs. Varus has desperately needed a vast improvement to his passive and I'm pretty glad about it. I think it'll make him a bigger threat during laning for the botlane. His AA range could be improved, considering the Hitbox / AA range bug between him and Vayne, as she's capable of auto'ing him even though he still can't reach her, despite having a higher AA range.\n\n\nThis is coming primarily from a Varus ADC main. However I've played him in every lane and role (Yes that does include Jungle lmao. Surprisingly was alright once the jungle item was bought) and I've been playing Varus solidly for a straight year. I do look forward to this improvement to shift his power to benefit the style I primarily played him in.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shadow Hazard","date":"2016-11-22T16:22:22.210+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looking at the pbe there are already changes to tone down both vayne and twitch, tone down AP kog while trying to shift some of that midlane caster style power into his bot lane AA style pattern, and tweak up the long overdue kalista.
