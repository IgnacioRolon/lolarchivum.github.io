We have him leave a rainbow trail as he moves and builds his e. Have his starts that follow him be either clouds or stars similar to the star guardians wars. His q can be a smaller cartoon looking unicorn and his ult should be similar to lux where he spits out a rainbow. Also a Chinese New Years skin for him would be cool as well. Something similar to the kogmaw where he is the Chinese New Years parade dragon.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-30T23:45:49.930+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kinda sounds like a reference to a certain adventurous cartoon show. :P\n\nGood ideas in here, so you should definitely post it to the [*Concepts & Creations Boards*](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts) so it can get far more visibility and discussion.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Imagine Turtlez","date":"2016-10-30T20:37:43.723+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i like the chinese new years skin idea","replies":[]}]}
