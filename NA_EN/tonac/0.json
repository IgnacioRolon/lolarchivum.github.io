Is there anyway to prevent my rank from decaying since if I do not have internet/power I will be unable to play. I live in Miami, Fl and it is projected to devastate the area I am in. I know it's just a game and I will prioritize safety and all that  but it would be really cool if those of us in the path of the storm could get some immunity from decay for the duration of the storm and the likely power outage for awhile. Thank you and have a good one!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-09T16:17:36.963+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Staying safe is more important than anything else!  We don't have a means to alter ranked stats or pause decay, unfortunately, even if we wanted to.  :/ I know it's a shitty situation, so please stay safe and ranked will be here when you're ready.","replies":[]}]}
