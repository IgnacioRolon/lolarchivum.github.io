But if you wanted to nerf this, there were less destructive ways, like increasing the detect range in early levels.\r\n\r\n2- Removing mana regeneration on passive: HP regen is just less useful for her in the jungle, considering how many ways of regaining hp there are, though this is lower in importance than the other changes, probably her spells will be cheaper to compensate.\r\n\r\n3- Removal of AD scaling: Honestly, being one of the very, very few hybrid champions was the selling point for which i bought her, losing the build flexibility is just a sad thing.\r\n\r\nBeing hybrid along with the playstyles that opened with early stealth,  just makes her in a very onedimensional champion to use.","replies":[]}
