I'd also recommend playing some Co-Op vs AI games for a bit to get the general feel of how MOBA's like League of Legends are played ^_^!","replies":[{"poster":"mamacita23","date":"2017-07-02T03:28:48.012+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah but right now i cant see a play button but i do see something loading","replies":[{"poster":"NinjaGuy69","date":"2017-07-02T19:42:42.559+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> yeah but right now i cant see a play button but i do see something loading\n\nAnother good place to learn how to play the game is in the Co-op vs A.I. matches. Choose Intro level bots. You'll get tips on the screen every few minutes that teach you some basics about the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-02T03:46:24.724+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahhhh so right now you're most likely patching. After the game installs, you do need to grab the latest patch files before you can play. In the meantime, try checking out Twitch or Youtube to see some gameplay so you can get yourself ready ^_^!","replies":[]}]}]}]}
