My average ping during the day is roughly 70, which i can work with absolutely no issues whatsoever. However, almost every night around 7pm to midnight, it spikes ridiculously high to around 350 consistent. I have absolutely NO IDEA whats causing it. I have no other programs running and nobody else uses the wifi. I have looked everywhere to find a solution and have not found one since. I doubt it's the internet/modem itself because as I said, it's fine during the day. If anyone could give me any insight on how to potentially solve this problem I would greatly appreciate it.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-03T03:05:30.453+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"What's most likely happening here is that your ISP is rerouting your connection to our servers during their peak hours in order to mitigate congestion on their infrastructure. This is actually a fairly common practice for a lot of ISP's, and the way we can check if this is happening is by looking at a traceroute log. I'd like you to use an application called [**WinMTR**](http://winmtr.net/) to grab this log. After loading up the app, simply plug **104.160.131.1** into the host field and start the trace. After 5 minutes has gone by, export your results as text and paste them in a reply to me.\n\nLet me know if you ran into any issues with those steps.","replies":[{"poster":"Zekeybooboo","date":"2017-02-04T01:27:11.966+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here is what it looks like when I have issues.
