The game provides the option to select the emote I desire each champion select.   The emotes aren&#039;t there the majority of the time even after selecting them.  Some games they work and some games they don&#039;t.  I am sure this is a bug.  I haven&#039;t found anything on the board about it.

The team I'm on is aware of the issue and we're committed to fixing it.  This is a frustrating bug for us, too - it's sporadic nature has made identifying the root cause pretty tricky to track down.  We're currently adding in more robust logging to help us investigate why this issue is occurring, how we can fix it, and what we can do to prevent other issues like it from happening in the future.  \n\nThanks for your patience.  \n\n*PS - Riot Evaelin has opted to type out the name of the emote in /all when it happens to her.  \"SAD BEE EMOTE\"*","replies":[{"poster":"Vekkna","date":"2018-10-19T22:22:45.377+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry to hijack, but would you mind taking a look at this Zyra bug thread and maybe give us some info on what's going on with her? No, I'm not referring to plant targeting that's supposed to be fixed in next patch. I'm talking about all the *other* confirmed bugs and (likely) unintended interactions that are exceedingly frustrating. \n\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report/JzaHlOna-zyra-q-plants-pulling-minion-aggro-dear-god-please-fix","replies":[{"poster":"OoviKat","date":"2018-10-22T17:32:37.946+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll make sure someone who knows about Champions takes a look, but this is pretty far out of my wheelhouse.","replies":[{"poster":"Vekkna","date":"2018-10-22T20:24:40.245+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for replying! Since I began the crusade to bring attention to these bugs and coding/clarity issues, I've had a really hard time finding any Rioter who deals with this sort of stuff. A few issues are just bugs to splat, but other issues go a little deeper into the weeds. \n\nLet me use examples from that link to explain what I mean:\n\n* Q plants pulling minion aggro:  Is this a bug or intended change that was mistakenly undocumented?\n* R tooltip \"bugfix\" in 7.20:  Was this tooltip change a mistake, or is plant enrage supposed to be +100% in game?\n* Plant health:  Are damage packets from MF and Corki passives supposed to deal 4 damage to plants or is this a bug?\n* Plant attack coding:  Are plants supposed to be coded as abilities (single-target, aoe, multi-hit, or dot?) or as basic attacks? If they are intended to be abilities, is it a bug that they're counting as basic attacks for Counterstrike, Tabi, Spiked Shell, etc?\n* Runes:  Plants behave like basic attacks for manaflow, single-target abilities for Ravenous Hunter, and multi-hit abilities for Comet CDR. Which one is correct and which ones are bugs?\n\nMost of that list describes how Zyra's interactions with other things are not consistent. It could be bugs with Zyra, other champs, items, or runes. Since we don't know how these interactions are *intended* to function, we can't help you with a competent bug report. For example, plants do *not* receive reflect damage from Molten Shield like they do with Spiked Shell. That makes me think the bug is *actually* with Rammus rather than Zyra. \n\nCan you tell me how I should go about determining who handles these questions and how to get in touch with them? Could be bugs with any number of champs, several items, and several runes. But to start, it would help if we could get official information on how these interactions are actually intended to work.\n\nThanks!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gali√∂","date":"2018-10-22T19:36:33.373+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah right..This Rioter just doesnt give a hoot. ;)","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"abon2","date":"2018-10-01T08:44:29.141+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i did saw that once there was nexus blitz, was quite sad","replies":[]}]}
