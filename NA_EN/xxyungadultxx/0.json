I've repaired my league of legends multiple times and it doesn't solve the problem. I've asked about 50 friends on mine about this and they also said they crashed many times. How is this fair? We are losing LP because the league client is glitchy and keeps crashing. Sometimes i crash just entering the league client itself and not just champ select.","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-05-05T20:45:26.186+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Based on your thread, I went ahead and looked at our data for North America as a whole to see if there is a large number of players having issues with crashing in Champ Select.
