They don't care what you say, they're there to ruin YOUR day. So by retaliating, you're not helping anyone and that can only get you into trouble.\n\nUnintentional feeders, on the other hand....Maybe they are having a bad day, maybe learning a new champion/trying a new build, maybe they are just plain bad. Either way, harassing them is not helping anyone. On the contrary, it could distract them and make them perform even worse, which is counter productive. Best thing is to give constructive criticism, some encouragement when they did do something right, or just not say anything. Heck, if you really want to, yell at your screen and let your frustration out. At least that way it won't affect anyone else in the game.\n\nI can see why someone would be toxic to another toxic player, but I don't think that's the best course of action either. Similarly to the intentional feeder case, if they want to harass you and make your day worse, then they don't care what you say. If you retaliate, that just mean you're not focusing on the game, which could affect the outcome of the game. Instead of a 4v5 with a monkey constantly in their ear, your teammates will have to fight a 3v5 while you two are arguing over nothing. If they say you're bad, show them wrong.
