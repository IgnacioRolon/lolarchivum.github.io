First of all I would like to say Hi and thank you for this amazing game that has kept me entertained for months. So I read about this post where you guys would give people some extra RP if they needed it, annnd I guess I need 100 more RP in order to get something I wanted. I won't be able to because it would be over by the time I get to recharge my RP. It would be over. If this sounds like too much, it's fine. I sort of miscalculated of how much RP I would have left. To make everything short. Riot, do you still give out RP to people and if you still do can I have 100 RP? I know it sounds like a lot but I just need that much to get the Icon. I have my championship shards ready and everything. I have 155 RP right now. If you were to be generous and accept it, I will be in your debt forever. Or Randomly take 100 RP when I have that much. in the near future.\r\n\r\n            P.S - I know there will be some comments flaming me or calling me stupid and I'll take that. I really was.    \r\n                                                                                                                                                        Happy Halloween and Merry Worlds 2016,\r\n                                                                                                                                                                    _FeelingFlames_","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-22T22:58:19.520+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You have a fair request, and flaming isn't common here so don't worry!
