I can give you an entire encyclopedia of my consistent mistakes that keep me from climbing. Like, I'm aware of why I have only ever entered promos to Silver 5 one time and failed it. Here's just the tip of the iceberg.\n- I never buy Mercurial Scimitar.\n- I am bad with using Mikael's Crucible's active on allies with perfect timing.\n- I forget to upgrade my trinket.\n- I rely on my teammates to assist me in making plays.\n- I am bad at cheesing, therefore end up feeding from the outplay.\n- I am bad at csing under the turret.\n- I am especially bad at missclicking the wrong champion in clutch situations.\n- I do not jungle. When I do, I'm horrible at it.\n- I do not watch my replays to learn from my mistakes.\n- I sometimes completely forget to buy boots.\n- I don't understand some matchups and how they beat me so fast.\n- I don't keep myself updated on what champions need to rush what from a patch-to-patch basis.\n- I expect too much from my teammates.\n\nThat being said, I have been told that I have a gold-level knowledge base. I know how to kite well, I know where to ward, why, and when. I can almost always tell whether the enemy team is doing dragon or not if it's not warded. I can also tell if they're sneaking a baron without it being warded. I have a 6th sense when I'm about to get ganked from behind my tower, and who's doing it. (That's general champion knowledge at work obviously.) I press tab and try my best to keep up with the enemy's items, and actively build against them.\n\nBarring that, I sometimes pick one support, then another without changing runes and masteries. I am also not completely clear on why which support picks which Keystone. This knowledge can't translate into carrying myself out of Bronze because I don't know what order I need to work on things is. I've managed to stay out of Bronze V for a very, very long time, so I'm assuming that's a sign I've improved somehow, some way. Recently, I've been able to stick closer to Bronze II, and if I end up Bronze IV, I always win my promos to III and rush up back, sailing through promos to II. I can tell I'm improving. My cs averages have gotten higher, my accuracy closer, my movement prediction more precise, and my reaction time quicker. Only when I improve the things I listed above on a consistent basis will I ever hope to win my promos to Silver V. God knows what I'll have to learn I'm bad at after that.","replies":[{"poster":"iisabrina","date":"2016-07-02T00:15:30.649+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you know all these things then you just need to implement them to get out of bronze. \n\nMercurial scimitar is a good item for adcs and some assassins like yi. \n\nThe reason many players are in bronze after so many years is the fact they cant implement these things.

How you do it, is important.\n\nIf a team mate is constantly getting gang banged by 4-5 people in another lane that might sound like bad news, to you, and maybe that person IS an idiot, but that leaves two lanes open for you guys to annihilate. \n\nGenerally speaking its okay to go Back and save yourself a death and comeback with full health rather than risk feeding them a death\n\nTry playing with your gold level or higher friends and learn to deal with pressure in maps.\n\nThen go to your own ranked account and focus on early game champs. When I play bronze matches with my girlfriend I usually ban trundle{{champion:48}}  and sometimes yi.{{champion:11}}  I take volibear Jg.{{champion:106}} \n\nYou say youre poor at jg but I ask why? Why do you think you do badly at jungle?\nIs it because youre not ganking, is it because youre not taking drags? The purpose of the jungle early game is to tilt the game into the teams favor. So if your team is dominating at 10 minutes you probably shouldnt be wasting a minute and half at drag. Just push carefully. \n\nLearn how to fake engage and run, you are good at kiting so you should be able to do this with ease. Fake engage is basically my term for wasting the enemies time. Its that stand still point in team fights where people are debating who goes in first. You want to fake engage close to your turret . Takes 3-4 people to do this while one of your guys split pushes. The split push causes enemy team to send 2-3 guys back to take care of this person, that leaves a strong balance for you folks to push lanes.\n\nBronze is all about thinking what can I do to help us get one step closer to the nexus without depending on my team.\n\nEarly game is crucial in bronze to see who cooperates and who doesnt. If someone doesnt respond to ganks or team fights, dont team fight and blame them, You know they are trash. Dont think anything is going to change in that less than an hour game. \n\nOne of the biggest roles that has an overall map influence is mid lane. The midlane is able to roam, assassinate adcs (usually) . Top lane has limited power. \n\n\n\nTo be honest the reason I Take volibear in bronze is I can gank, flip, attack, bite. He is tanky and does alot of damage early game, Even if your laner doesnt respond to your ganks, you can be efficient. His wave clear isnt bad. And he can be built in multiple ways.\n\nWhen I play volibear, I start at golems/rocks, finish red, if the enemy laner is zoning my laner to his turret, I gank and kill that guy. \n\nAnd after that guy comes back, I gank him again and try to kill him again, and at this point that butthead is tilted as fuck. So I farm a little and gank him again.","replies":[{"poster":"Dankstin","date":"2016-07-02T21:33:49.650+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But I main adc Caitlyn and support Morgana/Brand/Soraka. >_>","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Çhåryzård","date":"2016-07-02T00:38:29.309+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because if I play a champ enough I like to make them look prettier.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Droogzy","date":"2016-07-02T00:30:30.965+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have every champion I want for starter.\n\nAnd I'm financial comfortable enough to get skins without having to worry about drawbacks.","replies":[]},{"poster":"UsiTsukino","date":"2016-07-01T20:41:55.283+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why would I go to watch a movie, if I can watch the movie for free in t.v. anyways?

However, people don't just have the game and sit around doing nothing. Tristana, Garen, and Alistar are free champions through the social media outlets. At one point, the starter pack was available for free on Amazon, and it included all of the 450 IP champs at the time, champs such as Annie, Ashe, Master Yi, and Sivir. On top of that, there's also the free champion rotation.  So if you're starting the game, you have quite an opportunity to gain champions to learn the basics of the game with, and should you require a different champion, you will be earning the IP to buy those champions as you play the game. And you'll always play the game, so you will always be earning IP. \nOn top of that, at current, if you wanted to take Ranked by storm, you absolutely can with some of the bottom of the barrel champions. Garen, Ashe, Sivir, Soraka, Ryze, and Kayle are all very solid picks and very simple to master, so it's not like you'll have this burning need to dump them and pick up different champions in order to progress through the game. So earning IP for expensive champions isn't so much a hassle as you make it out to be, considering how easy it is to earn and the lack of an immediate necessity to replace the starter champions with the expensive ones. You can easily be content with any of the starter champs as you work your way through the game, and you can use your money to buy skins, rather than fall for the noob trap of buying something you can very easily earn for free with a bit of time playing the game.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Malfini","date":"2016-07-01T21:39:16.935+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's part of a hobby and game immersion.
