It would be something along the lines of RekSai however I would allow for the holes to be spread more apart and give them a stun if someone was to walk over them. Regarding lore this could simply be a new species from another island as there is islands on the map that have seemingly no one inhabiting them. This is a good idea for a new champion and I think you could expand it more and really plan out the kit!\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"The23rdGamer","date":"2019-09-22T20:50:04.736+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zq_w1B9yjzw/hqdefault.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"G0blinSlay3r","date":"2019-09-22T21:46:31.346+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=The23rdGamer,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=YE1yNa4H,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2019-09-22T20:50:04.736+0000)\n>\n> https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zq_w1B9yjzw/hqdefault.jpg\n\nNot good enough.\nthat a bunny costume.\nnot a bunny.\n\nyou have no idea how much i need that skin.\n{{sticker:sg-poppy}} ","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"4 Step Cadence","date":"2019-09-22T21:19:08.774+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I don't think there's any Vastaya tribes that are bunnies, nor do I think an Ascended or Demi-God would take on the form of a bunny.\nOur best bet would be something like a bunny Yordle.","replies":[]},{"poster":"IronyAndSublime","date":"2019-09-22T23:53:30.431+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Furry.","replies":[{"poster":"G0blinSlay3r","date":"2019-09-23T00:15:11.152+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=IronyAndSublime,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=YE1yNa4H,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2019-09-22T23:53:30.431+0000)\n>\n> Furry.\n\nAre you trying to insult me?\nbecause i take that as a compliment regardless.","replies":[]}]}]}
