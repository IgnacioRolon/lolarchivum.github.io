Used to be able to carry as sona or morg with only 1 other person being anything above average. Could essentially 2v5 carry a game if playing at my best. Innovated support morg a season before anyone else and would 2v3 beat the crap out of enemy bot despite enemy jungler camping as long as my ADC wasn't total trash. Innovated support but before he was the rage too and support Shen before his 2recent fads in bot. But when adc's are too dumb to be carried, when they blame you all game long, when team backs them instead of you, or when you can snowball bot only to get camped by 4 all game while mid top and jungle refuse to help you and they still manage to feed then yeah there's not much motivation to play support.
