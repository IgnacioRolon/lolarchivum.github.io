This may have been the glitch. The launcher may have thought that i opened a champion capsule instead of an honor one, so it didn't give me anything. I leveled up later that day by playing a few more games. Thank you for trying to help me with this. I need right about 150-160 BE to get a 4800 champ, so receiving the champion capsule is very important for me.","replies":[]},{"poster":"coolpranx","date":"2018-01-15T16:39:13.835+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I did open one, but it was actually an honor capsule, not a champion capsule.
