But I have no idea what role to choose because I have literally no idea how to play these roles effectively without getting a 0/15 death rate at least.","replies":[{"poster":"NoPaxt","date":"2015-09-25T22:16:08.974+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pick your favorite champ and go into team builder. Get good that champ, and let that define your main role. Soraka defined sup for me early, I then picked up Sona, Janna, Braum and Blitz. I bought Aatrox early in the game and love him, after feeling good about sup I returned to the top, but not with Aatrox, but with Shen! His sup tank play style suited me because I learned the support role and became a global sup champ. Learning Shen helped me understand ganking, so now I jg with my ever so loved Aatrox or Xin....\n\nI buy and play many champs with IP, Riven being the most recent, but her game mechanics aren't for me. So I'll look for the next champ to learn, but in this process I have learned 3 roles very well, and hope to figure out what I want to do about mid and adc...","replies":[]},{"poster":"DingleNutsMcGee","date":"2015-09-25T21:06:48.370+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you a newer player?? If so i would suggest learning a lane and not jungle. In my opinion every jungler needs to know how to lane properly and understand it to be an effective jungler. If you are new,  i wouldnt suggest jungling until you have a few hundred wins. You seem to gravitate towards top/mid lane champions so i would give either of those a shot. Problem with that is those are the 2 most popular roles and they can be tough to get every game.","replies":[{"poster":"Lillian Toran","date":"2015-09-25T21:10:58.325+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, most people choose top/mid, but I get shoehorned into either ADC/Jungler about 90% of the time. The other thing is that people WILL fight over what role they want. I've run into people who've done that, and wound up losing and dying more often than I should.","replies":[]}]}]}
