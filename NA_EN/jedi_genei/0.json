What is wrong with the Riot system that this happens to me over this nonsense!?!? My duo didnt get any bans for his banter!! Do actual people look at these reports or is it really based on how many people from one game report a player?? I feel completely cheated that I cant make jokes with my friends.

I get it, when people get offended, they&#039;re voices should be heard, but THIS.... this is just unfair..... a chat ban, longer queue times even, but a 2 week first strike ban is uncalled for and unfair...

Lol.\n\nIt's not a complete false equivalency. Internet anonymity is fleeting, especially in an age of content creation. There are players that have gotten LinkedIn requests from Riot employees because, they're in a shared industry. People can cross reference an IGN matching a streaming username and twitter feed. What you say, do can have IRL consequences though insignificant they may seem. A tinge of racism on your twitter feed 4 years ago can cost you a job say at Google or Riot.\n\nYou'd be surprised. Riot employees don't always play on Riot accounts. You think there ever was a situation where say an art designer went into game and had a raging teammate; looked them up, saw and awesome devianart profile, and said.... naw... that's a blacklist. That's not even just a Riot thing. That's a dev thing.\n\nIf every would be aspiring artist, technie, streamer, etc... actually thought that someone on the other team or their team might be at a company in a department they'd want to work, the toxicity would simmer down quite a bit.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"redniwediS","date":"2018-08-08T03:00:15.714+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"The 14 day ban is usually the third punishment in Riot's four tier system.
