Hear me out. \n\nI had a problem with the game at one point and fell victim to the trollduggery that we all can experience from time to time, and started tilting and shooting back at flamers and people who ruin games. This did not end well for me, I was chat restricted numerous times, and even suspended for 14 days THREE times with the fair warning we all hear about that I will permanently lose my $2k worth of RP purchases and my account. I would have been banned.\n\nWell I took a year off, it was a good break, and I came back \"reformed\" as the mods would call it, because upon my return I have had no violations whatsoever and increased in honor. This must mean, I was a flaming toxic so called troll who wasn't going to change my ways and possibly get the old perma ban on the wrist from Riot, but now I am not. What happened? \n\nThe fear of being perma banned made me take the break, and I still don't want to lose all the money I have put into skins. So I changed the way I play and communicate and even try to help others who get pissed off. \n\n**PERMA BAN POLICY CHANGE SUGGESTION**\n\nMake the perma ban policy have a one year limit, which may only be lifted upon the request of the player and upon the discretion of the company to allow the player who has attempted to make a behavioral reform over the elapsed year. \nI think this is a very reasonable suggestion given my experience, and it allows people a long enough break to seriously consider their bad decisions while still giving an impactful removal and punishment for misconduct. \nIf the player who was banned, starts acting up, they get on chat restriction, and another year ban period. That way its not too crazy with giving out another ban right away, and allows the players one emotionally bad game where they can say something and get that gentle reminder. \n\nSo, in essence Perma bans be changed to have a one year period with probation. This means if Riot feels the need to keep a person banned, they can, just as with their ToU, they reserve the right to ban any account for any reason, but making this punishment lengthy without being permanent still gives it teeth. \n\nThanks to those of you who actually read this whole post, and can consider my points.\nWhat do you guys think about this as a compromised change to the ban policy?","replies":[{"poster":"Prandine","date":"2020-02-03T07:11:09.778+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"While Necromancy may be handy (and sometimes needed) in media, it is not the case for old forum threads.

He did and she got arrested and charged with his murder. A permanent ban for it is perfectly reasonable as not only do you never know who might read that and take it seriously but you also shouldn't need a warning to know it's uncalled for.

Players who racked up hundreds of CRs would either use their limited messages to bully and harass others or just switch to trolling and inting when they couldn't abuse others via chat. Riot doesn't want people to simply switch up how they harass people, they just want them to stop harassing people period.

Helping players reform\n> 2.) Shielding others from the behavior, at a cost.\n> \n> We used to issue chat restrictions that essentially scaled indefinitely. \n> \n> We were able to determine that after a certain point the penalty no longer helped with reform. The 10-game and 25-game counts for chat restrictions are based on data that they were both light enough, and felt strict enough to encourage people to understand their behavior is unacceptable in game and change it.\n> \n> We also saw that the players in this 'large restriction' category defaulted to gameplay altering means of harassing their team. It caused an increase in feeding and trolling.\n> \t\n> The sample size of this population and time frame is huge.

Not only that but muting only prevents further flame from happening that game and does nothing for the flame that already occured. If Jill can't interact with others without forcing them to mute her (and really though why should everyone else have to mute her just so she can flame &amp; throw a temper tantrum?) then she's the problem rather than her teammates.

I am at work, so maybe it has been elaborated already and I just haven't refreshed. So here is my suggestion for the process. It sort of takes a page from the old lvl 20 challenge. That way it isn't passive like a 14 day ban.\n\nAt account creation, we add a question \"Have you previously been Permabanned?\" If ticked no, continue regular creation. If ticked yes, you must supply the Summoner name, Account name (assuming they can still be different), and email associated to the account. This is important as I would like to give these accounts a boost to level 15 and flagged as smurfs (which seeing as we work under the belief that smurfs get flagged and matched with smurfs, should be fine). Can also just have them start at lvl 1.\n\nYou have to be active and well behaved on this account. About as active as you were on the original account. This to prevent doing 1 game a week for a year just to get your account back (unless 1 game a week is normal of course). You must also remain true to preferred game modes, and since you linked accounts the knowledge os there. Meaning you can't just play bots or ARAM to get earn account back. If you were a rank grinder, once you hit 30 you would be expected to do ranked again. We can discuss transferring ranked rewards later.\n\nNow, this isn't based off a calendar year and I feel that is important to note. It is a game time year, so however many hours you had in year previously is the year to serve. So if you played 10 hours a week, you are expected to clock 520 hours game time before requesting a review. That is active game time and not sitting in the menus.\n\nHere comes the hardass part of my comment. Punishment Expansion. Keeping a clean account is important. I will be flexible for some of these numbers. Netting a punishment adds additional time on the main account, plus serving on this Reform Account.\n-10 game CR = another year on the main account to serve.\n-25 game CR = 2 more years on the main account.\n-14 day ban = 3 more years on main account.\n-Permanent Ban = 5 more years plus 1 year cooldown for linking another account.\n\n-LPQ (just in case people afk to avoid punishment) = 3-6 months scaling for each instance\n\nNow, I'm not completely unreasonable. You've shared how you can get punished multiple times and reform. So if you get punished on this Reform Account, you can earn credit by climbing back up honor lvls. Hitting Honor 3, 4, and 5 after getting a punishment will restore 4 months of credit. Meaning you can earn off some of the Additional Punishments; up to 1 year until the Additional time is paid off.\n\nHow does this sound? Again, willing to be flexible/modify some things. Numbers mainly chosen for ease of explaining/discussing.","replies":[{"poster":"Arcade Andrew","date":"2019-11-24T18:50:44.290+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My main issue with this as noted on my post about the issue: Is that this requires making a new account which most players ALREADY can do for free, and requires people to be honest.

Unless you have hard evidence proving that is the case, because how would they be able to tell for certain? Technically all of the permabanned players are \"repeat offenders\".

Granted I don't know how the lvl 20 one was handled, the 2nd one from a couple years ago I saw the posts. People always submit tickets asking to have punishment lifted. They posted about success.

It would also be total time so 5 hours a day everyday would be 1820. Also, you need to consider the opposite too. Maybe someone changed careers and they have more free time now.\n\n> \n> and then speaking of ranked, I just feel its a bad idea to allow them to play ranked so they dont ruin the experience of competitive games for others players\n\nIf they didn't play rank on the perm'd account, then they don't need to play. You can be a perfect angel in bot games, but if you are only losing your temper in ranked; you need to handle it. Alternatively, if you lock them out of Ranked play; they may not agree as the Ranked experience could be something they enjoy. (Note: the \"you\" part may not necessarily refer to you.

I was made aware of it and did contact support to see if I was eligible but I was told I wasn't/ it was to a select group of people, IE as I said on my post about it: Its illogical to say everyone whose perm banned would re offend if they only gave 10 out of 10000 People a chance (numbers are an example) \n4) I just think if they did announce it, itd be a pleasant change to their very strict ruleset that even the most nice of players sometimes have issues with.\n5) As long as the numbers were flexible and adjusted to your current playtime and averages, and did some fancy math that equated it to how you used to usually play.

I am at work, so maybe it has been elaborated already and I just haven't refreshed. So here is my suggestion for the process. It sort of takes a page from the old lvl 20 >challenge. That way it isn't passive like a 14 day ban.\n \n> At account creation, we add a question \"Have you previously been Permabanned?\" If ticked no, continue regular creation. If ticked yes, you must supply the Summoner name, Account name (assuming they can still be different), and email associated to the account. This is important as I would like to give these accounts a boost to level 15 and flagged as smurfs (which seeing as we work under the belief that smurfs get >flagged and matched with smurfs, should be fine). Can also just have them start at lvl 1.\n\nI had not thought of this, but it totally makes sense for accountability. Excellent idea!\n\n> You have to be active and well behaved on this account. About as active as you were on the original account. This to prevent doing 1 game a week for a year just to get your account back (unless 1 game a week is normal of course). You must also remain true to preferred game modes, and since you linked accounts the knowledge os there. Meaning you can't just play bots or ARAM to get earn account back. If you were a rank >grinder, once you hit 30 you would be expected to do ranked again. We can discuss transferring ranked rewards later.\n\nI don't think this needs to be implemented, what we are looking for is behavioral changes right, not making someone play specific game modes, but being inactive might not always be a problem in my opinion. Some people need a break, and that is in fact what helped me the most. \n\nBut I do see your point about activity, and if it is tracked over the course of time, maybe that could go in one's favor if this was in fact implemented. I like where this is going though for sure. \n\n\n> Now, this isn't based off a calendar year and I feel that is important to note. It is a game time year, so however many hours you had in year previously is the year to serve. So if you played 10 hours a week, you are expected to clock 520 hours game time before requesting a review. That is >active game time and not sitting in the menus.\n\nGiven that a perma ban is so final, maybe I can get on board with this, but time spent away from the game not in it, is the goal the ban, so it goes counter to the overall purpose of the ban to expect people to play so much, but there is accountability to consider.\n \n> Here comes the hardass part of my comment. Punishment Expansion. Keeping a clean account is important. I will be flexible for some of these numbers. Netting a punishment adds additional time on the main account, plus serving on this Reform Account.\n> -10 game CR = another year on the main account to serve.\n> -25 game CR = 2 more years on the main account.\n> -14 day ban = 3 more years on main account.\n> -Permanent Ban = 5 more years plus 1 year cooldown for linking another account.\n\n\nlol. \n\nThose are a bit much, but we have to start somewhere. \n\nI would be more receptive to \n\n10 game CR = added 2 months.\n25 game CR = added 6 months.\n14 day ban   = 12 months\nPerma ban on second account = 3 years added.\n\nReason being a lot can happen in 3 years. The reason I would not be as harsh as you suggested is that they are at least being accountable by adding their account info to the new account. Clearly they won't learn for a while, but 3 years should be enough. What do you think? \n\n\n> -LPQ (just in case people afk to avoid punishment) = 3-6 months scaling for each instance\n\n> Now, I'm not completely unreasonable. You've shared how you can get punished multiple times and reform. So if you get punished on this Reform Account, you can earn credit by climbing back up honor lvls. Hitting Honor 3, 4, and 5 after getting a punishment will restore 4 months of credit. Meaning you can earn off some of the Additional Punishments; up to 1 year until the Additional time is paid off.\n\n> How does this sound? Again, willing to be flexible/modify some things. Numbers mainly chosen for ease of explaining/discussing.\n\nIt sounds like a great idea, I am sure we would have our back and forth on the details of it all, but I like where this is going overall it is a great idea, thanks for sharing it. \n\n{{sticker:garen-swing}}","replies":[{"poster":"Imperial Pandaa","date":"2019-11-23T21:29:41.630+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=CominTowardsYa,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=W2Bt0WP7,comment-id=00030000,timestamp=2019-11-23T20:51:42.884+0000)\n>\n> I had not thought of this, but it totally makes sense for accountability.

Sometimes I think it dwells somewhat in the realm of being a babysitter though with the whole \"teaching people a lesson\" mentality. I don't know how to balance this without being too nanny state, while also being fair. I think this whole thing is too strange, and on one hand maybe we need to deal with these kids in certain ways like a parent, but on the other hand, we have grown ass adults here too, who have endured real hardships and may have kids of their own. Vastly different group of people here make it strange to me. Does that make sense? I mean I hope I was able to clearly articulate this thought. \n \n> And I agree people need a break overall.

I don't know if it being an openly public thing would help it, given the hacker nature of people, and how they always figure out how to skirt the rules to get what they want with no virtuous intention. \nBut alas here we are in the midst of this social human experiment, Online gaming as it is still relatively new.\n\n> Numbers go back and forth, but mine are additive not progressive.

They're for players who don't care to reform, and we can spot those players by the way they keep breaking the rules instead of stepping away for a year or meditating or whatever else they need to do to get their behavior under control.\n\nWhen deciding on the current punishment tiers, Riot looked at how likely a player was to reform after a certain amount of punishment. For example, most players never get punished. Most players who get punished only need a single wake-up call. A player who gets punished once again after two chat restrictions and a 14-day suspension is vanishingly unlikely to ever reform.\n\nPeople are actually granted leeway for a \"life changing issue.\" I've seen people go nuts and break every rule they can think of, after which they keep playing day after day with no interruption. It takes a lot of work to get a punishment in LoL. People who work their way up to a permaban have almost always made many mistakes, not just one. And, at the end of the day, you have to remember the people on the receiving end of someone who \"lost their shit.\"\n\nThe system has to weigh two conflicting objectives: first, minimize the amount of rule-breaking behavior people have to deal with; second, allow rule-breakers to reform so they can keep enjoying the game. That first objective has a _much_ higher priority than the second.","replies":[{"poster":"CominTowardsYa","date":"2019-11-24T15:11:11.315+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well I think your second comment is a little bit more civil and nice than your first, thanks for taking the time to elaborate on those points. \n\nWhat do you think about Imperial Pandaa's proposal on this thread?
