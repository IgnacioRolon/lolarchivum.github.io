This kind of manipulation is despicable and you are the people in my opinion that do not deserve to play the game, because of the ceaseless damage to do to the community.","replies":[{"poster":"AeroWaffle","date":"2019-11-04T08:17:47.441+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">How do we deal with these players who don't say anything wrong, but we know they are trying to lose, but it is not obvious, so they don't get seen on the Riot radar?\n\nRealistically? You can't.\n\nRiot decides whom is breaking the rules and deserves a punishment, not any one individual player.\n\nThis concept of someone being malicious while carefully staying under the radar is not a foreign concept anywhere, be it a game or real life. This is not a problem that really gets solved, because part of the problem is the person actively making sure that they're following the letter of the rules.\n\nYou can't solve that.","replies":[{"poster":"CominTowardsYa","date":"2019-11-04T08:30:46.970+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well that sucks. \n\nWhen you get this in your games how do you handle it or deal with it?","replies":[{"poster":"AeroWaffle","date":"2019-11-04T08:36:29.149+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=CominTowardsYa,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=6PX2khE2,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2019-11-04T08:30:46.970+0000)\n>\n> Well that sucks. \n> \n> When you get this in your games how do you handle it or deal with it?\n\nIt's their match too. So they're really just shooting themselves in the foot if they make a habit of throwing game because of petty reasons. Whereas I can treat the loss due to something outside of my control, they can only pretend the same.\n\nTo put it simply, I treat it like I lost a dice roll. Is it frustrating if the dice doesn't land where you want? Sure. But getting angry at the dice isn't going to change what number they landed on. Sometimes you'll run into jerks, it's unavoidable. I report them, mute if necessary, and move on. The best I can do is hope they trip up and Riot does detect it.","replies":[{"poster":"CominTowardsYa","date":"2019-11-04T08:55:06.061+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds like good advice for anyone to follow in general. \n\nI agree with the dice roll analogy, makes sense. \n\nI have gotten a lot better at not being that guy, and not exacerbating it when it happens in a game.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"BONUS DMG 2NOOBS","date":"2019-11-04T05:44:10.514+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"CominTowardsYa","date":"2019-11-04T06:19:32.437+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"Why is that?","replies":[{"poster":"Nightsky Pirate","date":"2019-11-04T07:17:53.580+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Your wording is pointed in one direction, to burn these players.

I play as best I can even when tilted. As such I often switch to ultra-passive farming and let my allies know that will be my prerogative, when playing from behind- especially when tilted. Which is unfortunately not to the liking of an aggressive ally, sometimes, which triggers situations like what you're saying and the best I can do is soldier on trying to not get killed and keeping my mouth shut. \n\nI believe that you're pushing the issue as the worst of all issues, firstly. Recognize that it's only a problem for you, and while it might be a common problem, it is not your place to demand action. \"Unchecked\", \"manipulation\", \"ceaseless damage\", you're pressing too hard.\n\nSecond, in line with what I said above, consider these people as humans who are experiencing an emotion that is affecting them. People get angry. Anger passes, if the beholder allows it. Many people need help doing that. Leaving lane, while a logical choice, didn't help in that regard, and he eventually left. And he'll pay the price for that, which might be nothing if it's not a recurring choice of his.\n\nLastly, that poll.

To an extent I'd say players should be allowed to not try to win a match. Where I'd draw the line is pretty far in - Don't actually intentionally feed and don't leave the match. However, if a player is in chat expressing a negative attitude, I would say that is definitely crossing the line. For example, if they're an adc and they're afk-farming while your team is getting pushed in and steamrolled mid, I would say this is okay, and there's some viable reasoning to it if they're playing an especially farm-dependent adc like Twitch or Vayne. However, if they then say something in chat along the lines of \"get away from me. I don't want anything to do with this team. Jungle difference. I'd carry you, but you're just not worth it,\" then there's an argument to be made that they're throwing the match.","replies":[{"poster":"CominTowardsYa","date":"2019-11-05T05:47:59.116+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I understand that.
