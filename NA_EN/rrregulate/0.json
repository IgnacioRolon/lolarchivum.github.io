I understand why the leaver buster is there and I love it, but client side errors should not be punished.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-19T16:49:16.870+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A [leaverbuster ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ)penalty only occurs after multiple games, and not just one.  The system will treat all leaves equally regardless of reason, because it still causes others a negative experience.
