Since your ISP partners with Cogent to get your connection to our servers, the pressure will have to come from their side in order to resolve this. You may need to request your issue be escalated a few times before you reach someone who can truly help in this situation.\n\nI hope this clears things up a bit more.","replies":[{"poster":"Not PoonCoon","date":"2016-11-19T04:08:42.598+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Haha, I tried:\n\nIf we receive high call volume regarding this or we can replicate that the latency exceeds 100ms, our NOC analysts will be able to open a ticket with Cogent.  We will continue to monitor for other reports of this latency impacting our customers' service, but if the latency exceeds 100ms, please let us know.\n\nThis is about what I expected. My connection is only 83-90ms up from the 30 it should be so clearly cross-country routing is OK even though it's extra strain on lines it shouldn't be in overall increases noise and wait time throughout the united states on one of the most highly populated games, no big deal.","replies":[{"poster":"Not PoonCoon","date":"2017-01-13T19:15:54.469+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just for an interesting story:\n\nI filed an FCC complaint - received a call a week after I filed it from my ISP (Metrocast) the route they see shows it goes to NYC then hops to Cogent who actually is working fine, there's this notorious hop from Cogent to Level3 in NYC that adds around 40ms of latency (effectively in game around 50ms) - I believe this was around even when I was young and used to play Quake 3 (13 years ago,) where I lived in Central NY and would get 65MS ping on NYC servers (RoadRunner.) The reason this works all properly with Comcast is they own all their own lines between here and your servers.\n\nI figure this information will at least help a couple people rest easier, but suffice to say there's no way of me fixing it by barking at a carrier.\n\nThanks for the suggestions though!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Not PoonCoon","date":"2016-11-18T23:29:18.230+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks I'll definitely try this.
