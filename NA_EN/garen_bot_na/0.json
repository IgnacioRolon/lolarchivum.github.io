I logged in and everything was fine, I selected my champion and got into the game. The second I joined there was tremendous lag. Im a fairly new player, and the lag was unbearable. It froze every second, I couldn't buy items not could I focus my screen on my champion. When I would click to move or use an ability it would take a few seconds to register. After dying a couple of times, I just started running around our nexus to not get kicked for AFK. Then I lagged out completely and got put in LPQ. Now I have a 20 minute LPQ, and ive looked at my router which is completely fine, and still experience the lag. Any help?","replies":[{"poster":"DWlGHT K SCHRUTE","date":"2017-06-20T23:28:30.792+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately OP, this has been going on since the patch.\n\nIt's happened to me randomly for several days and all of the canned responses have not helped. The only thing I found that does help is exiting the client and relaunching the game. For some reason it (MAY) clear things. It's like having a bad phone connection, for some reason hanging up and redialing fixes it (because you get a new virtual 'line' of communication). This is the best analogy I could use to describe it..  Initially , on patch day, rebooting everything didn't fix it so YMMV.\n\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/dWsiAsHL-the-game-is-beyond-broken-for-me\n\nHere is my thread created and lots of things to try inside of it!!\nI found that downloading the program to do a constant traceroute helped me to see that the issue was a riot router and not my internet, so that's why I relaunch the game, hoping to get a new 'route'.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-06-20T23:51:17.213+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey dude, every case is different.  I've gone over the context for your case in another thread, but to reiterate league is always online so connection problems can be common.  Why do you claim it's a rioter router when context was already given and ping spike happening well before?  :/  Your specific issue might not be related to others, so be sure to hit us up in a ticket as suggested.","replies":[{"poster":"DWlGHT K SCHRUTE","date":"2017-06-22T04:28:37.029+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Porocles,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=ZWRtAViY,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2017-06-20T23:51:17.213+0000)\n>\n> I&#x27;ve gone over the context for your case in another thread......  Why do you claim it&#x27;s a rioter router when context was already given and ping spike happening well before?  :/\n\nYou want to know why I claim it's a riot router? It's because it IS! You say you checked the context? What did you check sir? Both of my trace route results I copied and pasted into the thread I linked (the context you checked) from WinMTR show packet loss STARTS at 104.160.159.18. Am I misunderstanding this response? What context did you check , surely not my posts? If I mislead you somehow I apologize.\n\nThe hop that was causing packet loss for me exclusively was 104.160.159.18 and does belong to Riot:\n104.160.159.18 or ae33-br01.atl01.riotdirect.net is an IPv4 address owned by Riot Games and located in Los Angeles (Sawtelle), United States\nThis is public information that I acquired days ago when I was having the issue... \n\nThe way you responded to me with a \"hey dude\" like you're angry is very unprofessional. I am just trying to help the guy by posting my thread with a bunch of solutions to try in that thread so that he can try those if you're initial suggestions do not help since him and I had the same symptoms, he can narrow it down with the tool you suggested in MY thread.\n\nEDIT: I wasn't even having ping issues, I think you're confusing me with someone else who posted in my thread. My ping in game was 54ms, what it's been for years. I was having packet loss issues and the only place it was happening was on a Riot Hop. No one is pointing fingers or anything mean... in fact I thought you were very helpful and if you read in the thread you'll see that I thanked you!","replies":[{"poster":"Cute Traps ","date":"2017-06-22T16:24:15.458+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"dude chill out, you seem wound up pretty tight xD it was just a \"hey dude\"","replies":[{"poster":"DWlGHT K SCHRUTE","date":"2017-06-22T19:39:19.285+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=1Haider,realm=EUW,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=ZWRtAViY,comment-id=0001000000000001,timestamp=2017-06-22T16:24:15.458+0000)\n>\n> dude chill out, you seem wound up pretty tight xD it was just a &quot;hey dude&quot;\n\nHe said \"hey dude, every case is different\" .
