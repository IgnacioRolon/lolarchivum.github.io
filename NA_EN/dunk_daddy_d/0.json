Every time I try to view my ticket I am asked to log in, which I can't do because I am trying to recover my account, so do you just receive the response over email? Here is my ticket number #23658243. I had information I needed to add to my ticket but I have no idea how to view the ticket since it wants me to log in to view it.  Note that I am still logged in on the website, but I can't log in to the support site.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-11T16:42:32.441+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It can take a bit for our specialists to review the situation and respond, as well as the queue of tickets on the day.
