Also a play on \"Curse like a sailor\".\n\nMy cousin was in the Navy but he never really explained all the rules and regulations at the places and ships he was stationed.  Another way you can tell I'm joking is that I used the term keelhaul.   That was an old punishment reserved for people someone really really really hated.  They would be tied to a rope, thrown overboard and then dragged under the ship where wood splinters and barnacles would cut them up.  Horrible torture and/or execution method.   Obviously doing that to someone in modern day, much less on an aircraft carrier or battleship is out of the question.\n\nI'm kind of scared no one was able to read into that part and realize I was joking.","replies":[{"poster":"AriCei","date":"2017-09-14T23:03:54.744+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah see that's you missing my sarcasm :)","replies":[{"poster":"Beas7ie","date":"2017-09-14T23:44:57.982+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=AriCei,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=Bsu4GrsE,comment-id=00040001000100000000,timestamp=2017-09-14T23:03:54.744+0000)\n>\n> Yeah see that&#x27;s you missing my sarcasm :)\n\nIt's the internet so it's a lot harder to tell when someone's being sarcastic vs in RL.   The same can be said for my post as well too I guess, though anyone who knows anything about the modern military and naval history would know that keelhauling is a horrible practice that stopped being used LONG ago(at least I hope so).","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"AriCei","date":"2017-09-14T18:02:04.136+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel like this might be untrue..\nBut even if not, not sure what it illustrates exactly","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2017-09-13T10:54:33.063+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"saying shit alone is fine. \n\ncalling people shit is a harassment / insult and thus will be punished over many games.","replies":[{"poster":"AriCei","date":"2017-09-14T18:00:35.215+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I get that.

Also, was the second chat restriction for a 10 game or 25 game length?  The usual progression, in that short of a time frame, would be to move from 10 games to 25 games.  If you were given back to back 10 game chat restrictions, then that does sound like it might be some sort of system error, and you may want to send in a ticket to Player Support to ask them if they would mind looking into it for you.  \n\nHowever, if you were given logs of different matches than those on the first chat restriction, and it went up from 10 games to 25 games, then it probably was not a mistake and was likely a punishment handed out by the IFS.  As some of the others have said, you can still earn punishments while serving a chat restriction.  If there were instances where things were said, and reported, and the system judged them to be toxic, then yes, it can issue an additional chat restriction very shortly after the first one ends.  Players can also earn a 14 day suspension if they continue to show escalating toxicity over a short time period while serving a 25 game chat restriction.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Periscope","date":"2017-09-13T05:42:52.204+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can still receive a punishment if you showed no signs of reform during your chat restriction.","replies":[]}]}
