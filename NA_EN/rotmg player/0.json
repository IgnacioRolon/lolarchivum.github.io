I have checked and disabled game dvr and game bar ( idk the difference ) but nothing fixes it, playing and alt tabbing out of other games doesn't mess with my brightness.

I'm on Windows 10 Creator's Edition as well, on an iMac with AMD graphics. Alt+Tabbing does it, and it also happens whenever I complete a game. The funny thing is that the game has regular brightness when I'm playing, it's only when going out of the game that the brightness increases dramatically. I usually turn night mode on/off to reset the brightness to normal, but it is an annoyance and a tremendous strain on the eyes..\n\nHas anyone found a solution to this? \n(I can't revert to the previous build either, since that option does not show up in my settings at all.)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Balozaibar","date":"2017-04-13T22:23:54.079+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"same problem here, gtx 1070+windows 10 creators edition + 381.65 driver","replies":[]},{"poster":"ROTMG player","date":"2017-04-13T08:57:15.186+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Still haven't found a fix to this , and completely resetting my pc is not an option","replies":[]}]}
