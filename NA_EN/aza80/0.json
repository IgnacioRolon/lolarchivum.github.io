This system has completely gone to shit, this is unreal.  This was me responding to the human after they tried to explain why I deserved a ban because I did not agree with the blitzbot.  At the bottom is my minimal chat log due to me muting the player that was afking and inting.  \r\n\r\nI completely disagree, unless you were in the game playing or watched the entire match with what was being said and going on you have no clue what you're seeing in that chat.  The majority of the Red Highlighted areas you have marked were directed to my other teammates that were being ripped on by this guy as well, how are you going to tell me it was all directed at the inter that caused us to lose the game and wasted several people's time.  That joker should be banned and RIOT needs to get a better system if I can be banned from the chat log that was sent to me.  With that being said the only negative thing in that chat to that player was \"you're a joker\" and after that, I tried to tell him we have a chance to win and explained his champion to him.  Nothing else on this chat was putting anyone down we were all messing around and most of that was back and forth with my Support who was getting completely ripped on and he agreed with everything I was saying including him picking Teemo hoping someone would dodge so he didn't have to play with the Nasus that had inted in his other game prior to this one!  \r\n\r\nI want someone else to look into this, I do not deserve any kind of ban/restriction or honor loss what so ever  This game needs to be completely watched from my end!  This a bull shit system that needs to be rehashed completely, which I'm sure you already know because I've been asked for my opinion and taken surveys on the terrible blitzbot system and so have my sons and friends.  So tired of this game's garbage system and then support that tried to explain things nicely but have no idea what the chat's meaning even was.  \r\n\r\n**\r\n**Please explain the chat below and point out where and why I should be chat banned.

The things other players said and did in your match might produce in you an impulse to do certain things that may include breaking LoL's rules, but your behavior is your own, and you are responsible for it. If you really think about it, this is a good thing. If a toxic player's goading could exempt you from punishment for your flaming them, calling for reports, etc., then it would logically go the other way as well, resulting in punishments for players who didn't necessarily break any rules but weren't quite as friendly and positive as their teammates. Can you imagine a world where \"didn't participate in the dance party and ignored all of our jokes\" was a valid report that could get someone suspended for two weeks? We don't want that situation anymore than we want \"called our support a braindead waste of space\" to be considered an _invalid_ report just because, say, the support was telling their team to harm themselves while they merrily ran it down mid.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Aza80,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=KabYtA6t,comment-id=00030000,timestamp=2019-10-11T04:46:36.179+0000)\n>\n> Is there that much there that warrants labeling me being someone that is screaming and yelling at my teammates in all games?\n\nYes.

You brought up farting on peoples faces and guys grabbing other guys balls, when the only real problem was the abuse of women. Why bring up those other things?

Like calling trump supporters nazis. \n\nPeople have a tendency to create this reality in their head and  then twist words to make it fit that reality and then shame them for it. I understand how it happens, but I think it is PARAMOUNT to fight it and stay true. Dont just judge an entire company based on the actions of some low to mid level employees. \n\nThats all, man. I was trying to show you, that just because you have a juvenile sense of humor, doesnt mean youre a mentally ill degenerate lol. But you dont like Riot, so youre perfectly willing to say that, because they are associated with Riot, being employees and all. \n\nIt came off like you were basically engaging in that identity politics. Where Riot is one side, and you are the other, so you are willing to say anything factual or not, to shame them and make them look bad. And then you thought I was defending them, so you did the same thing to me. Its whatever, I understand how it happens, especially after going back and reading my post where I followed \"shes now on various podcasts with him\" with \"that shit is hilarious to me\". I obviously meant the farting is hilarious to me, but you assume the worst because you thought I'm defending a company you hate. This post will be removed for talking about \"social issues\" anyways, unfortunately. I just want people to be pragmatic about things. Not base everything on whether or not they agree with your own personal opinions.

Glad we could clear that up. I hate to be all lecturey but I just wanna bring one last thing up after going through the thread.\n\nYou seem to think that anyone who defends anything Riot does, is just a \"fanboy\". Now, that implies that there is no reasoning behind their defense. They are just doing it because they have a hard on for Riot for whatever reason. This is more of that shit that I hate. I hope you don't mind if I just give you some reasoning behind Riots rules, so that you can perhaps better understand it. Please dont take this as condescending in any way, Im gonna lay things out just for the sake of clarity and seeing how my mind connects everything and my logic. I dont mean to imply that you arent already aware of any of this.\n\n\nSo, Riot is a business operating under capitalism. Their goal is profit. More power to em, I say. Capitalism is great. So when you have a game with a reputation as being very toxic, it scares away potential players. Also, you get many players who quit the game because theyre sick of being flamed all the damn time. (Ive seen threads of \"I quit, so fucking sick of being flamed blah blah\" for example) Obviously, this is bad for their bottom line. They want the largest playerbase possible.\n\nSo then they implement a tribunal system where players can vote who gets punished for what. This tribunal system ends up being way too slow. The load of cases is just too much for the volunteers of the tribunal, not to mention issues that I would hate, such as players being able to judge my actions through their own filter of life experience and morality, but thats just me, I dont think Riot specifically had an issue with that. I just dont trust people to judge others like that semi-anonymously. \n\nSo Riot scraps that. They make an automated system that works so much faster, and with technology being the way it is, its very accurate. They base the parameters of this automated system mostly on results of the tribunal. If most players voted to punish a behavior, they make that behavior punishable in the automated system. So its the PEOPLE that created the standard, in a way, not Riot. Riot just implemented the system. \n\nNow, I would never support any restrictions on speech in real life. But the rules of this game exist only in the vacuum of the game. They are not a moral code, or life lesson. They are simply there to deter any toxicity, and increase potential profit for Riot. Im so sick of people looking at it like theyre forcing some kind of morality on us. They arent. Theyre trying to deter people from flaming, for the sake of profit/playerbase. The rules do not apply to real life. \n\nI hope this kinda helps you understand where at least some people are coming from, when they defend the system. I could care less about Riot. I play starcraft 2 way more than league. If league died tomorrow, I wouldnt feel a thing... unlike when Marvel Heroes shut down cuz that company went bankrupt... god i miss that game. So I have no reason to defend Riot specifically. I defend logic and reason, or at least try to.\n\nYou dont change people's minds with insults. Never open a discussion with an insult. I guarantee the other side will only dig their toes in the sand even more. So just calling people fanboys serves no positive purpose. It doesnt help sway opinion, its irrational, and only makes you come off as unreasonable and unwilling to actually consider that they may have a valid reason. Everything is about understanding. It took me like 30 years to realize this. We need to understand eachother. Not pick a side and just ignore anything the other side says.  Sorry if that came off like I'm lecturing you. You just seem like a reasonable person and I hope this opens your mind a little. \n\nAnd I totally understand the whole hypocrisy of telling you to reform and what not. I hate that term reform, just because of the implication of some kind of righteous morality. But reform in the context of league, simply means falling in line of their rules. Reforming yourself to follow their rules. Not to be a better person, even though that implication is definitely strong, I will admit, but applying Riots rules to real life wouldnt necessarily make you a better person. It would make you a complete pacifist. So dont apply their rules to real life. You are expected to be a pacifist in a sense, but is reporting someone and getting their account banned really pacifism when you look at it that way? I would think pacifism would be doing nothing about being flamed. But you dont have to do nothing. You can report them and get them punished for breaking the rules they expect you to follow.

You fucked yourself over.\n\nUnfortunately, I couldn't dodge, I had just dodged a Teemo support troll not long before and didn't feel like waiting longer as the night before I had 4 remakes in a row and didn't play at all because I was tired of the AFKs and wasted time so I just wanted to play the game.  I had no issue with the Nasus, the rest of my team did, I've seen Nasus jungle work just fine in this elo.  Riot removed any of my post that explained the game and entire situation so feel free to post and accuse as they did when the whole story isn't seen or able to be read.  Kind of hard to defend myself when they mask any wrongdoing and remove my post that proved their system wrong.  It's happened to everything I have ever posted against them and I'm surprised this is still up and not locked as my last 3 were removed completely.\n\nWith all of that being said not everything is included in the chat log that they send you, you have no idea how anything went and apparently did not read the explanations like most that are probably downvoting. There was minimal negativity, I was explaining to the team and also letting my team know the game was not over and we could still win MANY times throughout (which is no where in the logs they sent me), while this guy continued to berate everyone on my team. Because they only show minimal chat you would think it was all aimed toward one player or a bad team just like the Blitzbot system does and did in this instance.  Which ultimately is the entire point of this post, their system is not right and they know it, I took surveys sent to me from them asking about their blitz bot system, behavior system and what they could do to better it. \n\nThis match was 45 minutes long my entire team was complaining about him and it was taking away from gameplay which is why I was telling them to just mute him, /mute all, report him etc....... HE was causing everyone on my team to die left and right and type more than play. I was responding to my teammates that I didn't have muted on most of the chat listed.  I guess I shouldn't have said \"you are a joke\" but him giving up and putting the team down non stop definitely warranted the comment because no matter what he was a joke.\n\nThis is very typical of our society in general, all accusations and guilty until proven innocent.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FizzOnMyJayce bb","date":"2019-10-11T16:45:56.296+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"then wait 5 minutes before being able to rejoin? like i have time to be waiting all day","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"FioraWillCarry","date":"2019-10-11T15:00:28.098+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Nasus?
