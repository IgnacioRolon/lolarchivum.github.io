After seeing pretty strong feedback from players that Invisibility felt core to his identity, we tried different iterations instead of using a Camouflage mechanic. This current version still grants Teemo Invisibility when standing still or in brush. In addition, he can cast it to enter stealth while moving instead of having to standing still, and still lets him move a fair amount outside of the brush before exiting stealth. Since this version is substantially power-up in favor of the Teemo player, we've made it so enemies can knock him out of stealth by dealing damage to him. Our belief is that this still lets Teemo players be tricky and find previously inaccessible places to ambush opponents, and still lets them be clever enough to navigate the ways opponents can respond (by entering stealth out of their vision, for example). **Please let us know how you feel about this version!**\n\n2. We're trying something experimental with Invisible Teemo leaving footsteps on the ground behind, as a subtle way of giving warning to enemies without totally spoiling the ambush. The way I view this iteration is, let's find the best way for opponents to feel like Teemo keeps some element of interactivity when going Invisible. If footsteps give enough warning, that might be a better form of counterplay than knocking Teemo out of stealth upon taking damage, and we could think about removing that instead. **Again, let us know how you feel about all of this!**\n\n3. [Mushrooms can bounce infinitely!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJdUP9sZNNI)\n\n4. Bonus HP to mushrooms is gone. The combination of this with allowing Teemo to have 5 mushrooms at once instead of 3 felt overwhelming to opponents, and we saw strong feedback that the Teemo players strongly preferred more shrooms over more health.\n\n5. Overall damage down a bit. This is mostly to make room for Teemo moving while Invisible, as we talked about above.\n\nThanks,\nRiot Jag\n\nhttps://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/9.2.1/img/champion/Kaisa.png","replies":[{"poster":"Cosmonaut Teemo","date":"2019-03-12T22:19:31.906+0000","up_votes":57,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well, I have been a Teemo main for four years, basically since I started playing league, and while I know I can't speak for everyone when saying this. I see problems with the current design.\n\n1.) The biggest problem I see with the current iteration still circles around the new E. I have played with it on the pbe and tested it to see how it works and the conclusion I keep seeing is that in its current state it feels like a dead ability. While we can stealth indefinitely, and at least like our current live passive, stand still indefinitely (with pbe threat of being knocked out of stealth from taking any stray damage, say from tiamat or a skillshot). The footstep trail is just too glaring for it to be useful while moving in stealth. Its hard to understand the point of invisibility when you can clearly be seen with it. The trail appears directly under teemo, so while attempting to ambush someone, roam or gank, etc the stealth feels utterly pointless as it announces your presence as much as being  visible would be. Because its so easy to see and predict Teemo's location. I understand that a invisibility skill like this is very potent and potentially very powerful, and it can call on a great deal of skill for the player to use effectively, but in its current state it feels bad to use both in and out of lane, as you cant really trick people with it, sneak up on people with it, or try to use it to get to safety with it. Having counterplay to it should be important, but as it stands it makes the skill feel just bad to use. Other fixes I could possibly see for this is if the footprint trail had a 1 or two second delay behind Teemo, perhaps increased with the skills rank, that could still signal his location without it totally announcing his presence to the enemy. Because a giant pair of green glowing footsteps approaching you is hard to miss, and even worse when he can be knocked out of that stealth by anyone just throwing a skillshot his way, it can invalidate the benefit of being able to move while stealthed.  If so much of our power budget is wrapped up in this skill, I want Teemo to be able to use a mobile stealth effectively rather than just a questionable improvement of his old passive. \n\n2.)The second thing I really want to ask is how Teemo's W can be modernized. It is a skill that is undoubtedly archaic, and while effective eventually when max ranked, it has no scaling effect, and despite supposedly giving teemo some good mobility, W just feels like a passive effect that would be tacked onto some other skill in modern league. I have heard and seen people suggesting that activating Teemo's w could remove slows, or grant slow resistance, and thats a powerful, significant effect, one that may be too powerful given some of the changes to Teemo's kit. But it would make his W feel more helpful to his kit, and give teemo more options against hard matchups and assassins.\n\n3.) The last thing I see in this rework is how shrooms have a lost a lot of potency as damage tools. While Im not opposed to this, because I know that in the past they have been a very toxic part of his kit and one that has been hard to balance. The current state of their low damage and scaling ratio has forced Teemo into a even worse relationship with Liandry's torment. Shrooms are a key part of Teemo's identity, and because of Liandries they either are doing too much damage, or Teemo is forced to buy Liandry's to make them deal an adequate amount of damage. So if you would like to tone back the damaging factor of Shrooms, and instead give us more of them, which is a solution that I can agree with, something else should be done to help support Teemo's scouting playstyle.  Instead of giving us something that is rarely, situationally useful, like infinite bouncing shrooms, shrooms having a larger vision radius, slightly lower mana cost, given Teemo is expending a lot more mana than he used too, and now for a tool that does little damage on its own, 75 mana per shroom on a champion who normally dosn't build mana, is costly.\n\n4.) The last thing I can say is about his current pbe Poison passive. While I think the implementation of this is great, and from what I understand, most of the community dosn't have an qualms with it. I think that the poison synergy with other poison using champions, like Singed, Cassio, and Twitch, is only going to be negative for him. Getting a 50% damage upgrade when attacking the same champion as your adc, say, if Teemo was a support, is hard to balance, and it might spiral out of control, and likewise, I feel this small thing might be making his passive harder to balance with the rest of his kit. Leaving the 50% poison damage increase to work with Teemo's own kit rather than other champions might be a way to free up some power budget for other parts of his kit as well, whether that be in base damages or in adding a new effect. But considering either how rare this effect might occur, or how toxic it might be when its used efficiently, I think that its just shackling Teemo to a support role for other champions and it dosn't seem like a good change in the long run.\n\nAll That said, I thank you for being transparent with the rework process with the community. I think that keeping Teemo's identity is an important part of modernizing the champion and I think that your efforts to engage with that and us are admirable. I hope that I have been somewhat helpful.","replies":[{"poster":"Terozu","date":"2019-03-13T10:23:24.587+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":1,"body":"Honestly I think his passive should remain stealth,  but his W should let him move while stealthed for a short bit, or let him tumble in a direction while stealthed without breaking it.\n\nGives him the move while stealthed without radically changing his kit and updating his W so its an actual ability.  It would also put more emphasis on his classification as a unique playstyle since noone else interacts like that to move.\n\nLike literally I feel that if his W became something like \"Stealth Roll\", when he stealths, and it lets him move slightly in short bursts without giving up his location, i feel like it would be a better overall design.","replies":[{"poster":"Beardedheathen","date":"2019-03-13T19:24:41.846+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"and how adorable would that to watch!","replies":[{"poster":"Terozu","date":"2019-03-13T20:09:03.532+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Teemo tumble would be very cute.\n\nHUP! owo","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"joesange","date":"2019-03-12T21:50:36.717+0000","up_votes":32,"down_votes":3,"body":"My take on what and what I did not like on all these changes:\n\nPROS\nToxic Shot moved into passive is fine (gonna hurt his early power spike a bit but...)\nPoison increasing Toxic Shot damage feels really fun and rewarding\nMore shrooms is not as good as you might be thinking because whenever a Teemo has capped 3 he will find a place for it and keep one in case of a fight happening so having 3 or 5 will only make a difference when you die and respawn.\nNew E is good and fun.\n\nCONS\nReduced damage on his whole kit.

The Noxious Trap, Toxic Shot AP scaling, and attack speed per level nerfs hit too hard, pushing a lane with AP teemo feels like hell.\n\nOn-hit builds are too good compared to other options, that's why you nerfed the attack speed but the side effect on non-AS builds is terrible. What needs to be nerf is the 50% bonus damage on poisoned target. At least remove the poison tag on Blinding Dart, and if it's not enough, nerf the 50% bonus.\n\nEvery game I feel that any deviation from the best itemization will cost me the game, which is not ok.\nTeemo, like a Jax for instance, is a fun champion because he can perform relatively well with many different builds.\n\nI like the current version of E, it feels much different from other stealth abilities, the _ambush_ vibe is here, whereas the _chase_ feeling is gone. Good. \nBut the Trail on Guerrilla Warfare feels bad because we cannot use it to escape a chase. I believe it's kinda balanced for offensive purposes.\nChanges to E made it almost equivalent to current passive (the trail+revealed on damage effectively means not invisible while moving out of bush), but now we can cast it while running.\n\nI believe your train of thoughts was: _AP Teemo nukes squishies from accros the map, let's nerf his R and put some power elsewhere_.\nOk, but then let's just nerf the damage when the trap is far from Teemo and leave the damage as is in a 1000/1500/2000 range...\nLet's have a look at the power shift:\n\n* R hard nerfed. Multibounce is close to useless. 5 ammos is nice after a recall but mostly useless then. 10 HP was quite strong.\n* Bigger vision range while stealth. Cute but useless, especially in the jungle.\n* I don't believe E has now more power, at least not with the trail and reveal on damage. It's basically the same as before with a mana cost but castable on the move.\n* The scaling per level of Toxic Shot is now following the live version in a E-maxed-second scenario. Thus last hitting is harder, but at least the first levels are not insanely broken against melee champions.\n* Q hard nerfed, Toxic Shot AP ratio nerfed on-hit.\n* Attack speed per level nerfed.\n* Bonus damage on poisoned targets (Q and R).\n* Better mana regeneration to follow mana costs increase.\n\nAnd with all this, the PBE version of Teemo feels stronger than the live version. If you build On-hit, that is.\nYou put too much power in his auto-attacks, it cripples the rest of his kit. And your follow-up nerfs (AS/level, P on-hit ratio) made it worse.\nBasically, Teemo's only tactic is to land a Q or R on his target, and auto attack it fast enough so it dies before Teemo does. There's absolutely nothing else he is useful for now.\n\nAlso, the interaction with other poisonous champion is overpowered and will have to be nerfed if it sees live server.\n\nMy suggestions to distribute Teemo's power budget more evenly in his kit:\n\n* Revert AS/level.\n* Toxic Shot amplified damage only on targets affected by Noxious Trap, and buff R's AP ratio 1000/1500/2000 units around Teemo.\n* Toxic Shot scales from level 1 to 9 again (but not amplified by Q anymore).\n* Toxic Shot DoT AP ratio buffed to 15% per second (bigger ticks don't benefit from attack speed).\n* Make the E footprints fade much much faster than now, for a small chance to escape.\n* W passives additionnally gives a 0.25s speed burst when Teemo changes direction (like 2.5 units per degree), so we can dodge skillshots more easily, while keeping the mobility creep to a minimum.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KsSoHyôKo","date":"2019-03-12T21:02:04.703+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":1,"body":"I like everything but his current W which feels so underwhelming.

The mushrooms. The most uninteractive part of this ability is the ability to one shot you when you're nowhere near them. I think the most intuitive solution to this is to just make it so that the mushroom itself does less damage, but makes your on-hit do more damage to the target after they've been hit. You kind of did this in the rework, but I think you could actually go deeper with that because the fun part of teemo is setting up mushrooms in an area and being able to dominate that \"zone\". So i think if you let teemos set up camp somewhere and destroy somebody after they've been hit by a mushroom, they'd have a lot of fun, even if the mushroom itself does less damage.\n\n2. The current stealth. Just make it so that it's invisibility in a bush and camouflage out of a bush. No footsteps, you can make us exit stealth once you take damage, that's fine. Please just no glowing footprints. It feels really bad because it just feels like we don't have stealth right now. The footsteps entirely invalidate the ability.\n\n3. Move quick. This thing doesn't make me feel like I'm moving particularly quickly at all until I rank it all the way up. Just make it cleanse slows. I think that's thematic and just makes it a lot more relevant.

No, and I’d argue that virtually none of the frustrations that Teemo mains actually do have were addressed by Riot’s changes.\n\n**Riot’s vendetta against invisibility.**\nI don’t fully understand Riot’s fetish with killing invisibility mechanics, but here’s what I do know: Teemo’s old passive was fine the way it was and didn’t need to be turned into a balance quagmire by giving him a pseudo-twitch ability. \n\n**Shifting power on balanced abilities.**\n Riot’s argument is that shrooms are too frustrating for low skilled players, so they butchered most of his kit and loaded all of that damage back into his on hit poison—which, of course, also led them to nerf his base damage and attack speed because, surprise, loading all of a champion’s damage into an on-hit passive is stupid as fuck. But also, let me just say the entire idea that Teemo’s shrooms are problematic is bullshit. Teemo is not dominating low elo play and if I listed all the abilities that “frustrate” low skill players we’d be here all day. Teemo shrooms are already weak and arguably the weakest they’ve ever been due to a long list of nerfs and other changes to the game.

It won’t exist after Riot shits on our shroom damage and simultaneously destroys Teemo’s wave clear. \n\nStop introducing gimmicks like infinite bouncing shrooms or a crappy Twitch camo rip-off. Stop breaking a champion who is already completely fine. You know what Teemo mains hate? They hate how mana intensive it is to keep up shrooms that get cleared constantly by oracles.

There are TON of other champions who need a ton more love than teemo does (especially if you dont really give love at all). He is currently one of the most played champions in normal games, and middle of the pack in all ranked regions except Korea.\n\nYou try to give him \"cool, new mechanics\" but who asked for that at all? Because he is opressive in low elo? He can kill people from across the map? Well Karthus can do that too, the entire team too , he scales better, and his ult isn't revealed by a 75g item or a trinket which is free. What about Yi? Or Nasus? Or Veigar, all stack champions can be pretty opressive against low elo player.\n\nYou know what is actually fun about Teemo? He has one of the best passive in the game right now, either its useless, or its game changing.\nHe has a ton of item build diversity, Tankmo? Onhitmo? Burstmo?

While his E changes are interesting, it should just stay an invisibility ability, you can even kick him out of the invisibility if hes hit with certain abilitys.

Fantastic idea.\n\nWhy the hell are you nerfing his AP ratios, just leave his abilitys as they are, they are pretty much fine as they are , expect the W which is complete bloody garbage. With nerfing his AP ratios you get him to be played on hit, \"item diversity\" my ass.\n\nYou don't need to make Teemo viable in pro play, stop shoving your great new ideas to modernize a kit down our throats, focus on Champions like Voli or Morde.

Nobody gets hit like that so bloody fast. His winrate was 52% at that time by the way, extremely oppressive !\n\nTeemo is one of the most unique champions in the game right now, his ult is punishing if you are stupid, but useless against clever players. \nNO champion exist right now who loses his ultimate , because there are a ton of possibilitys to reveal it.\nHis scalings allow him to be played as full ap, or on hit, or as an assassin. Please just leave him alone.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TonyTonyMordecai","date":"2019-03-13T00:34:49.870+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"My opinions in order of how often I think about it:\n\n1. Why change everything but the W - \"Move Quick\"? This is the one ability that is the most lack luster, and comparably less useful than Miss Fortune's new W (which I'm assuming is maxed second), because MF gains attack speed, resets her strut, and cooldown gets reduced when you proc Love Tap. Move Quick only grants a small percent bonus to his movement speed where Strut gives more movement speed, up to 100 at max rank. If Teemo's W was changed to be a passive effect (like Strut) and moved somewhere else, then you could give him a different ability that had farther range or some other utility that helped him be useful if he couldn't get into range with his Q or auto attacks, or if he wasn't able to throw a shroom. You know, like a flare/flashbang type of thing to be more scout like.\n\n2. I get that his passive attack speed being more accessible and more on demand in approaching a fight or in the middle of one as opposed to having to stand still warrants some power taken out/moved around (like giving him more damage if he directly contributes damage to a fight through his auto attacks), but at the same time, why did you reduce not only the base damage, but also the ratios? I don't know what build/role you're trying to push him into, or if you're just trying to switch some things up, but \"overall damage down a bit... make room for teemo moving while invisible\" seems a little much, not to mention you pulled a Sona and upped the mana cost while also lowering the damage in both places. I can understand the R, but maybe the Q should've kept the AP ratio.\n\n3. I'm glad you kept the invisible. I would've understood the camouflage if his E was closer to Twitch's Q or Pyke's W, but the previous iteration was not fun at all with the self slow, especially when compared to the other abilities which actually speed you up. It's not like Evelynn passive, or Rengar R, and even comparing to the other camouflage/invisibility spells, none of them slow you down. They all give some sort of bonus or utility.\n\nNot really an opinion or complaint, but where do you guys at Riot (or just the people working on Teemo or in the balance/rework team) want Teemo to go, and what are you balancing him around in terms of opponents and build paths? Is he balanced as a ranged top laner or are you simply balancing him around certain situational strong points (like more Toxic Shot damage if the enemy currently has any poison effect on him) and then seeing where that goes?\n\nAlso, when is he going to get a model update like Morgana?\nThanks for all of your hard work, Riot Jag.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cruciver","date":"2019-03-17T17:21:47.249+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"My belief on this is that Jag is too close to the issues on Teemo to balance them appropriately because he is a Marksmen main. Teemo's primary issue is not the damage from Noxious Trap. \n\nTeemo's primary issue is that he doesn't fit his theme any longer. Teemo's supposedly a swift scout, someone that strikes out on his own, poisons his enemies and sets traps for unsuspecting enemies. Early on in his life-cycle he fit the theme well. There was less damage back then, and far less mobility, so he was in fact fitting into his design space. \n\nThematically, Teemo has lost that. Everything is more mobile than Teemo these days, originally, there was a much higher level of wariness when it came to both mobility and power creep from the devs, and the shift away from that has led to many of the issues he has.\n\nTeemo mains, at least those on /r/Teemotalk are mostly in agreement that we would like to see his W reworked into some sort of short range dash, in addition to granting passive movement speed boost that is always active. My solution has always been to change it into a short range roll like Vaynes that will bounce Teemo into the air if he hits a mushroom. Put it on a 10/9/8/7/6 second CD and bob's your uncle. \n\nAdditionally, we would like to see more viable mana costs on Teemo's ultimate. We spend far too many resources on creating shroom fields for them to be completely destroyed by 1-3 FREE ttrinkets (~60s CD) and Duskblade, which is one of the most picked items. Either a health boost to the shrooms, a mana cost reduction or both are needed to keep Teemo in a competitive place. \n\nWith regards to moving Camouflage and Toxic Shot around, I believe that it's largely irrelevant. Teemo mains like his passive where it is, and while active invisibility is nice, and especially nice when outside of a bush, I believe the trade-offs that have been proposed for it, both the self slow and the foot-prints idea, were completely counter-productive.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MaximOH4L","date":"2019-03-12T22:41:44.570+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why u guys u just change teemos W and add the venom sinergis and thats it ? what u really pretend is to fk teemos playstyle imo","replies":[]},{"poster":"cocacolalips","date":"2019-03-13T03:47:49.569+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"Footprints is a fun idea, but it doesn't belong on Teemo. His stealth duration is too short and too situational to really take advantages of all the possibilities a feature like this bring. It belongs on a new champion that is permanently invisible. Instead of looking for a character model, you look for footprints around the map. A similar feature is used to great effect in some PvP stealth multiplayer games like Dead by Daylight, where survivors leave traces of blood behind them when hurt.\n\nBreaking his invisibility/camouflage with damage might be okay, but you have to make sure E can still be used reliably to run away from a fight or when chased, like Twitch does. If you can prevent him from entering camouflage by continually attacking him, the spell is useless.\n\nAbout the rest of Teemo's kit, what needs to be looked at first and foremost are his Q and his R imo. Both are old mechanics with little counterplay that create lots of frustration.\n\nYou already talked about his R and how you want to reduce the damage. Seems fine to me. It's probably not enough but I can't think of anything else atm.\n\nIf there is no way to make his Q less reliable, by making it a skillshot for example, then the duration should be reduced significantly to 1s max, or maybe lasts x (1-2) number of auto attacks. I think it should be similar to Sivir's spellshield, or Fiora's parry, a powerful spell of very short duration that requires precise timing. It should also be consistent and block all auto attacks, enhanced auto attacks, runes/items/effects triggered by those auto attacks etc. \n\nSpeaking of Q, there is a lot of stuff you can do with the blind debuff that Riot has yet to explore. From screen tints, to black screens, to long term effects. What if every time a player was blinded by Teemo, his field of view was reduced by say 100 or 200. Debuff is removed upon visiting the fountain. It would be similar to Graves or Nocturne black screen. At first you see your entire screen, then each subsequent blind the circle around your champion that limits your vision gets smaller to a point. Thematically, that would reinforce the tactical warfare element teemo is known to be about. Gameplay-wise, that would add some macro gameplay element, where players have to choose between recalling more frequently, or run the risk being an easier target to mushrooms and ganks due to lack of vision. Does that sound like a mechanic worth exploring?","replies":[{"poster":"GG ım cute","date":"2019-03-13T05:42:23.233+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Teemo is supposed to be an assassin.

I mean, maybe contradictory with what i said using yasuo a example,** I think just CC skills should break Teemo's stealth** ,  you see the current live stealth on normal servers can be break by a knock-up, but i think it would be fairly balanced for this one to be breaked by any CC ability, most of champs owing one (charm, slow, stun, root, fear, etc.) Doing so enemy will have to actually know teemo is around and not just random hit him cause their cat jumped on the keyboard and randomly ezreal flashed Q in a bush.\n*  I stilll don't know if Teemo is self slowed, but in combination with the above handicaps, the slow just unnecessary.

Following I will response to every of your 5 statements (and sry english is not my main language). \n\n1. and 2. The stealth mechanic of teemo was allways one of my key strategys to be successfull. I really like the idea that you need to cast it so you cant get invisible everytime u stand still or enter a brush. Also I think the ability to still be able to walk in bushes and the ability to leave them and stay invisible for a short distance is a good thing for him. \nBut in my opinion it's really important for him to be Invisible, not Camouflage, and that damage taken by a skillshot or something shouldn't knock you out of it. Being able to break his stealth with an item like tiamat would be stupid in my opinion. I'm fine that he should be knocked out of it by \"knock ups\" and \"knock backs\" and I feel like this should be a thing. \nI also think the idea with the footprints is good as long as it is a bit delayed like half a second or one second. I feel like this and the glitter effect if teemo is hit by something should be enough. \n\n3. That's a really good change!!\n\n4. First, yes more shrooms are better and healthier for the gamplay with and against teemo than more health for the shrooms. But overall I don't even think that teemo needed that adjustment. The shrooms where fine like they are on the live server. I really don't like that the dmg of the shrooms is reduced that much.  I still belive teemo is a mid and lategame champ so I feel like his ap rating and his base dmg on his r should stay the same. You stated that you try to make him more viable in high elo. Account the fact that teams in higher elo know how to play against teemo shrooms (with sweeper and pinkwards) it's allready hard enough for teemo player to deal dmg with them if not throwing them into a group in teamfights. \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA little annotation for the rework: I love his w. It's practically and simple and that's good. But I feel like it could use some love too. Looking at teemos kit I have like 2 ideas how it could get a little bit better. You don't need to do this just think about it. \n\n1. He has no gap closer in his kit and if he is ever slowed he will die presumably die. So how about if he activates his w give him slow resistance for a short duration OR remove all slows from him. \n\n2. You mentioned that you want teemo to be able to get out of bushes invisible. So why dont make it that teemo can walk invislbe in bushes but only can leave them invislbe when you activate your w. \n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThat are my thoughts on the teemo rework.

Anyone with half a brain will notice them and react accordingly. The fact that his entire kit is getting nerfed to the ground so that he can have a mobile stealth should be compensation enough. These footsteps make it obvious where he is and the ability in its current state really only serves as a way to evade targeted abilities and auto attacks, which seems pretty awful as his q is a blind. I think a good way to keep invisibility while giving counter play is to make teemo invisible in brush or while idle and camouflaged while moving outside of brush.

But, why, when you (talking of Riot) rework your own logo, you do not take time to rework Teemo altogether, not especially change all his kit, but giving him a more modernized appearance and a more coherent kit and place in the lore that is clearly lacking at the moment?\n\n     Anyway, if you really want to only rework his abilities... Then why do you keep the W? It has been one of the most hated Teemo spells, not in the \"iT'S bRoKEN!!\" department, but more in the \"archaic\" one. I appreciate what you are trying to do with the rest of his kit, it helps him breath but... the W just feels out of place. That is why, after talking with experienced or newbie players, Teemo mains and Teemo haters, I tried to work around an idea that has its place with your idea... only if the efforts are there. I am not pretending I am a better Game Designer, since I am only studying, but this issue has to be adressed.\n\n[EDIT 4/17/2019, 6 hours later to the original post] After some feedback, no more increased base hp, nor range increased. E buffed and some changes reverted.\n\nList of changes [According to his stats on the 04/16/2019 version of PBE] :\n\nPassive [Toxic Shot] :\nDecreased bonus basic attacks magic damages from 8-50 to 6-45\nDecreased poison DoT magic damages from 24-180 to 20-170\n\n* **Q [Blinding Dart] :**\nAP ratio from 0.6->0.7\n\n* **W [Guerilla Warfare] :**\nMoved to W\nNo longer sees 25% farther while stealthed.\nBonus attack speed when Guerilla Warfare breaks from 20/30/40/50/60% to 20/25/30/35/40%\n\n* **E [Tactical Move] :**\n_it is just a placeholder name_\nMana Cost : 40\nCooldown : 13/12/11/10/9\nDashes through less units than Aatrox, and bounces the same amount of units than a shroom.\nAmount of Bounces : 1/2/3/4/5\n\n     Teemo rolls in the cursor's direction, though not through terrain. If he had activated Guerilla Warfare, Teemo instantly enters invisibility. It can be used during Guerilla Warfare's invisibility without counting as Teemos traveled. \n\n     If the roll connects to a placed shroom, Teemo, while breaking his invisibility state if he had one, bounces from it just like when he places a shroom atop of one another, but revealing the shroom for 2.5 seconds. If Tactical Move is leveled, Teemo can then bounce on a certain amount of shrooms depending on the level. Bouncing, unlike rolling, can go through terrain.\n\n     After the end of Tactical move (either roll or bounce), Teemo gains 10/20/30/40/50 more range for his next 3 basic attacks for 3 seconds.\n\nAn image to showcase the idea :\nhttps://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/414247705452347393/568028524338872330/unknown.png\n\n* **R [Noxious Trap] :**\nBase damage decreased from 150/250/350->150/250/300\nAP ratio increased from 0.4->0.5\n\n     So... what is the goal of all this?\n1. Not making on-hit mandatory. A lot of people have already talked about that they liked the AP assassin aspect more than on-hit, and do not like being forced to delete entirely this playstyle. When you consider a scout thematically, scouts can also assassinate in a matter of seconds instead of sustaining damages.\n\n2. Making the W (now E) more coherent with the rest of his kit. It gives Teemo mobility (Swift Scout) that is also tightly linked with the other aspects of his \"scout\" thematic. Either infiltrate quickly or get out no matter the consequences (loosing shrooms while you are bouncing off of them).\n\n3. Enabling Teemo to have more teamfighting abilities (or rather... possibilities?) while reducing his lane bullying. A scout should not be only able to face one person and that is Teemo's current \"only\" job, a scout has to go deep and seek weaknesses to help his team thrive, so giving him more mid/late game abilities/possibilities and reducing his bullying is a way to make him more viable throughout all ranks and not only a nightmare for the Iron folks.\n\n     All numbers might not be correct, but it is there to give you a general idea of the feedback I wanted to give. Please consider answering to people, it really feels weird to ask for feedback and leave so many good comments unanswered. And when I said \"efforts\" higher on the post, it was meant to be \"if you want to flesh out some of Teemo's kit, you are going to need some updated rigs and animations\".

I've been playing him AP, AS, hybrid. And as support, no less. I'm finding no troubles with the builds.
