I&#039;ve been a competitive gamer my whole life, and before getting Diamond in League of Legends my video game mistress of choice was World of Warcraft, where I held onto a 9 consecutive season streak of getting Gladiator in Arena before I realized it may be time to do other things (will put away my horn now). I&#039;ve also really enjoyed Starcraft, Super Smash Bros, the Batman: Arkham, XCom, and Metal Gear Solid series, and (might be dating myself a bit here) I have a soft spot for Goldeneye 007 and Mario Kart 64. I got into League through my WoW friends when the servers were down for maintenance. Someone in Vent said they just started playing LoL and it was really fun, and I replied that if I wanted to micro 1 unit for 45 minutes I&#039;d just build a Ghost in SC2. I was a little ignorant at the time...\n\nAside from Video Games, I enjoy Sports Cars and Motorcycles. I&#039;m currently running a Ducati Panigale 899 that I keep under armed guard, seeing as the last two bikes I got after moving to LA were both stolen in a matter of weeks. I&#039;ve also always loved sports, particularly Football (Giants fan for life) and Basketball. I listen to a range of music, but am mostly into Hip-hop and House/Electro. My Spotify has been blasting a lot Run the Jewels and Disclosure lately, although my boy Kanye is never far off the playlist. Before I was a professional nerd for a living, I was something totally different - a software engineer at Microsoft.\n\n**WHAT AM I DOING AT RIOT?**\n\nSome of the fun stuff I&#039;ve done at Riot include the Lucian mini-rework, Runeglaive and Zeke&#039;s Harbinger, and most recently I lead the charge on Rift Herald. I&#039;ve spent the last 2 years on Live Gameplay (aka the Rito balance team) nerfing your favorite champ, but I am moving to new Champion team to find new ways to add more anti-fun into the game. Until that happens, I&#039;ve had front row seats to every balance and game health struggle that we&#039;ve had in League for the past two years, so feel free to hit me up with anything in that area.\n\n**WHAT AM I GOING TO TALK ABOUT?**\n\nI&#039;d like to talk about interesting struggles with the live state of the game, ranging from the intricacies of preserving game health, to how to interpret win rate metrics, to how we handle eSports concerns. I might also get into what it&#039;s like for a novice champion designer to start taking on the task of building a brand new iconic experience in LoL. Finally, ADCs are my peoples, so if that&#039;s your passion, or if you just need help with that Vayne build, I&#039;m down with the clickers.","replies":[{"poster":"Keevalroy","date":"2015-12-11T20:55:32.469+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":4,"body":"Look, I'm not going to sugar coat this so I'll just come out and ask it: why does the balance team insist on protecting problematic champions and toxic mechanics by shielding their favorites from harm while healthy champions are nerfed for absolutely no logical reason?

So for me it looks like youre only nerfing her since she gained a little popularity, not because you have conistency within your balancing. I might be wrong, but that´s really the way it looks. \n\nAnd I think the mistake you always will do is balancing Elise as a sort of tank...while right now i can just play her full ap in dominion and there´s not a single Champ in this game that i would not 100-0 if i land my stun on them (which isnßt that hard). She´s just fundamentally flawed since the first changes (when she was released she had been sort of a rbuiser, and that worked rather well), and anytime she´s played she´s broken.\n\nAlso to go back to Anivia...I don´t oppose the nerf itself, she had been strong - the timing is just suspicious. What´s even more suspicious though is the way those nerfs occure...Brand, the most popular of the dot-mages gets a slight nerf to his mana (but hey, spiritfire is fairly new)..while Swain get´s his CC cut in half - as an immobile old man. I mean Swain has lots of issues, but his w does have good counterplay available...if you want to nerf him, why wouldn´t you turn down his e dmg? it´s undodgeable harrass, and a bigger issue for squishies laning against him than them being stupid enough to get caught by his w.\n\nI mean, it might all be in best intentions from your side, but the way it looks right now really doesn´t lead to much faith.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MrBuffington","date":"2015-12-11T23:15:07.415+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think it's relative. Take Caitlyn; she's consistently one of the most played ADCs, but I think most people would say she's pretty stable/balanced, at times even underpowered, but there's still a solid number of people playing her at basically all times I've seen. She's an inherently popular champion. Meanwhile, a champion like Warwick has historically had a pretty low play rate, but had a ridiculous spike in play during late season 4. Warwick wasn't exactly an inherently popular champion (he has a small core fanbase and a bunch of people, myself included, eagerly awaiting a rework), so when he has a massive spike in play rate, it's usually because he's horrifically broken.\n\nBack to your example; Anivia is a champion that comes and goes from the professional meta (I think she saw a fair amount of play in season 2); generally now-a-days she doesn't get played (she also tends to have a low play rate in general). A lot of times she just doesn't fit in how the professional scene works; pro teams are more coordinated and pull off a lot of early plays and rotations, where Anivia is a champion that notoriously takes a long time to scale up. Compare that to Elise, who also comes in and out of the professional meta, but the advantages she offers fits with how professional games tend to work; she has a lot of early game power and flexibility, etc. If Anivia starts to see a lot of play in the professional scene, it's probably because her designed weaknesses aren't as apparent as it was when she was in a balanced state, where if Elise is seeing a lot of professional play, it's probably because how she's designed as a champion inherently fits with how pro players want to play the game.\n\nThis could point to a larger problem where some champions don't really have a shot to see professional play, because the way they're designed doesn't fit with the professional scene. On one hand, the way the pros play the game is certainly not the only way to play the game, and certainly isn't the \"correct\" way to play the game (esp. when factoring different skill brackets; this is why when you see Uzi or Doublelift pick Vayne, you cheer, but when you're in Wood 3 and someone picks Vayne, you dodge. This is also why Katarina is the bane of my existence, but if you pick her in Challenger, people don't really care). On the other hand, and I think this is something that Riot is well aware of, it really sucks when you crush your way through lower elo playing Amumu, and then you hit a wall where you don't really have a path to succeed since people know how to counter hard engage (unless, of course, you're one of the very few mains who mastered the champion to such a degree that you crush everyone anyways, but again, that's the exception).\n\nI think Riot is generally in favor of diversifying the game, and their work, especially recently, has done a lot in that direction (maybe _too_ well, at least initially, with the Juggernaut update). Anivia seems a bit difficult, since I think a lot of people will point to her as a marvel in champion design, so I don't know that Riot will really look to change much about her. We'll see what happens with the immobile mage update coming up (which I'm really excited for).","replies":[{"poster":"Earl Eulrich","date":"2015-12-12T01:22:43.742+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">I think Riot is generally in favor of diversifying the game, and their work, especially recently, has done a lot in that direction (maybe too well, at least initially, with the Juggernaut update).

We'll see what happens with the immobile mage update coming up (which I'm really excited for).\n\nI think this is were i really have to disagree, as there´s really some causation/correlation issues here:\n\nJuggernaut created diversity, because people tried playing the champs again - but in the end it had been a straight nerf to Darius and Garen on higher levels (yea, i know darius had been played much during week 1 in worlds, but quarterfinal+ teams already figured out he had been rather easy to handle), while making them even more unhealthy in lower elos. Skarner turned out rather broken to...which made him see at least a little play and morde - well we all know how that went down. So all in all none of this had been an improvment, and the meta went stall very fast again.\n\nFor marksmen it´s even worse, as most Champs that have been popular anyway are working better now, while anything else may be a little bit more diverse, but ultimatly you can´t beat rightclicking in a crit-item-meta, so it still leads to 2-3champs rightclicking better than others...before this Marksmen actually had been more diverse, as there had at least been trinity, botrk and IE-carries (and for the more sofisticated users even AD-Casters/Bruisers) - now we´re back to crit on everything. So all in all it´s a lot less diverse now than it had ever been.","replies":[{"poster":"MrBuffington","date":"2015-12-12T05:32:41.266+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not saying Riot got it perfectly right; I said they're in favor of creating diversity and are working to do so, and have made strides in that direction. Juggernauts had basically been forgotten by the vast majority of players; I think you have to appreciate the challenge it is to make them relevant in a game that's basically built to kite juggernauts. Yes, they need more work, but do you really expect them to get everything right on the first try? That's called getting lucky\n\nThere's also the misconception where people just throw around the buzzword \"diversity\" as if it's supposed to be a fix-all solution. I assume you're referring to the fact that Essence Reaver now has crit? (Otherwise I have no idea where you're coming from saying ADC itemization is less diverse; Corki's still a Triforce ADC, Caitlyn/Jinx/etc still build IE, Vayne still builds BotRK, Lucian made the switch to Essence Reaver. Miss Fortune is actually getting played, quite a lot, actually. Kog'Maw is building Guinsoo's Rageblade. You go back a few months and people forgot that item was still in the game. And did I mention Quinn?). The fact that Essence Reaver gives crit isn't a cut against diversity, it comes from a greater understanding of how the game works. The way the marksman class functions necessarily favors the maximum amount of damage possible; the multiplicative scaling of crit is just too good to pass up. Need I remind you that Triforce also has crit?\n\nSure, they could have pushed it further, done some crazy restructuring of the game to the point where ADCs are taking ignite/smite and building cinderhulk, and everyone's just running around S1 style without a clue what they're doing, but what does that really do for the game, besides getting you some boy-scout badge for \"diversity\"?\n\nThe game is iterative, where there's a patch every 2 weeks, for a reason. If this was like, WoW where you have a major expansion pack every few years (that you have to pay for, btw), yea, I would expect them to get things right, but even Blizzard (a company with a lot more experience and resources) gets it very wrong a lot of the time. CS:GO just got completely broken by a single weapon. Starcraft 2 still isn't balanced (Zerg is underpowered, from what I understand), where the game's been around longer and they only have 3 races (even if you count individual unique units in each of the races, I'm pretty sure it's still less than the number of unique champions in League at this point).","replies":[{"poster":"Earl Eulrich","date":"2015-12-12T22:59:24.670+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">There's also the misconception where people just throw around the buzzword \"diversity\" as if it's supposed to be a fix-all solution.[...]\n\nand that missconception seems to be on your side. Diversity means that different decissions lead to different gameplay/patterns. Right now though it doesn´t matter much if i go Trinity, ER or IE...it´s all crit and in the end the most efficient crit-path will dominate. There are no real tradeoffs.\nBefore the changes there had been real differences between trinity (short trades/poke, 1item powerspike, reliability, utility), ER (push, sustain, poke, reliability, midgame powerspike) and IE (fhishing for crits/prolonged trades, needs gear to really ramp up, more of a lategame spike) - no the differences are really slim and you donßt get a 1item spike out of any item anymore since everything relies heavily on crit. Also, the option to trade reliability for some dmg doesn´t really exist anymore.\nI like most of the Changes to Championgameplay (except MF and most of the specific \"make everything scale with crit because we all hate the stat\"), but the item-changes had been horrible almost throughout.\n\n>I'm not saying Riot got it perfectly right [..]but do you really expect them to get everything right on the first try? That's called getting lucky\n\nwell you know, it´s not exactly rocket science to know it´s a bad idea to force champs without mobility to stay on target for a long duration to finally have an impact. Before the rework Garen and Darius both had a good niche as a counterpick top and both had some instant effect upon (finally) reaching their target, also both had better ways to reach their targets. Now they both have more impact if they can stay longer, but way less on the short duration....meaning players that know how to kite/focus will make them useless 90%of the time (higher elos, ranged champs) while everyone else suffers more (lower elos, melees). It´s just really stupid design.\nFor Skarner and morde they seem rather lost where to put the champ in general and they should just have thought about it more before pressing those reworks.\n\nAll in all their intentions might have been good, but their means of achieving some more Diversity just really had been off the mark, and their comunnication about it is just misserable. There´s no real discussion about marksmen-changes anywhwere, nothing on the value of champs feeling good to play as and against, it took months for them to maybe agree that they had been wrong with Morde, not much on games feeling a lot more snowbally...dunno, i didn´t buy RP last year (except for getting the OG and Flashwolves Icon to support them a little) and from the looks of it i cannot support them next year aswell. Right now their design seems to be a lot of shambles that doesn´t really fit together.","replies":[{"poster":"MrBuffington","date":"2015-12-15T03:24:05.447+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> and that missconception seems to be on your side.

Instead, what you're choosing is differences in gameplay, I think it becomes most pronounced in the 2nd or 3rd item, like I can see myself going SS/RFC/Runaan's in different situations, depending on what I need to do. Before, I'd always just take SS since that was the cheapest option for crit+AS, the passive was nice but not really the primary reason to buy the item for me.\n\nI don't understand what you're saying about ER/IE/TF; the previous trade offs still exist in the same capacity that they used to; some champions naturally synergize with certain items better than others, especially for the first major item. It doesn't make much sense for Tristana to go ER since she doesn't use a ton of mana; she basically just auto attacks. On the other hand, Corki _could_ go ER first item, but his powerspike with TF is just so much greater, so it's still a better first buy. Ezreal could probably go either item first, depending on playstyle.\n\nI think your real position here is just that you don't like crit, which is fair, it isn't my favorite game mechanic either. My problem with how ADC was previously, though, was how for a lot of champions, I'd be stuck having to buy IE first or else risk being completely irrelevant damage wise; even if I wanted to opt for another first item because I was having issues with sustain or something. Now, IE isn't as critical (heh) a first item because there are other options that have crit innately, so you don't have to worry about losing the edge (heh) vs a champion with IE.","replies":[{"poster":"Earl Eulrich","date":"2015-12-15T18:36:07.390+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">I don't understand what you're saying about ER/IE/TF\n\nthat is pretty clear.\n\nthen let me do an example for Sivir: \n\nearly on i could go ~3paths, heavily affecting my playstyle:\n\nIE->PD/SHIV->LW/BT->whatever + as-boots  - meaning most of the dmg comes from rightclicking, (\"proper\" adc-build/play)\n\nER->Ghostblade->LW->depending on the game either defense or Trinity+maybe even IE + cdr-boots ->most of the dmg, especially midgame comes from spells, lategame can be allright but is more risky but early-mid-dmg is higher and more reliable (AD-Caster-playstyle)\n\nBT->LW->SV/Randuins + boots(defensive or offensive, depending) -> consistent dmg+sustain, but not as high, best laning+ strong midgame, but not enough dmg to \"carry\" lategame (Bruiser-playstyle, go in hard, soak some cds, fall back to sustain and hopefully clean up)\n\nyou´ll probably argue that option 2+3 are artifical - but they really weren´t. Depending on the situation all of this had been absolutly viable (i´ve won a ton of games as bruiser-carry, having the opponent team focusing way to much on \"the adc\" while my midlane/top cleaned them - though my prefered option if i donßt have to solocarry is usually AD-Caster). \nUnfortunatelly this Community really doesn´t like to think about the options at hand but rather copy&paste efficient builds they have seen somewhere and that´s exactly what they got with the rework.\nThere´s no choice anymore, its all just ADC-builds and play, even ER doesn´t make you anything AD-Caster-like unfortunatelly, the focus on crit for the item means that it´s just optimal for enhancing the rightclicking with spells, but it doesn´t put any less focus on rightclicking. And that´s a damn shame.\nBruiser is still sorta doable, but got heavily nerfed with the really expensive BT+less efficient dmg-modifier of LW, making it even more niche.","replies":[{"poster":"MrBuffington","date":"2015-12-15T21:32:15.636+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I don't think that's a problem with itemization, I think that's just how the game is designed. I'm not so sure any of the marksman champions are really built to be true AD casters that don't auto attack, if that's what you're really after. Urgot might be the closest thing. Ranged AD champions will always auto attack a lot; that's just how the game works; You scale with AD, so you build AD, so you have a ton of damage built into your auto attacks. Only if your auto attack really sucks (for one reason or another) and you have some spammable spell that you can use to trade/harass/last-hit will you actually get a ranged AD champion that fits the caster role that you seem to be after.\n\nEither that or you're just frustrated with the meta-humping community, in which case I still say ADC itemization had less variation previously.

One problem with Lee Sin is that even when he shows up very heavily in the competitive/pro scene, he doesn't even get close to that power level for the vast majority of our players, since he has such a high degree of execution required to optimize him. When we did those buffs, he had been out of the pro meta for a good period of time, which meant that he was _really_ suffering for most of our players (he was one of the lowest win rate junglers in the game, even when he had one of the highest average games played).\n\nAgain, I'll make the statement here. Lee Sin is for the most part a healthy jungler, even though there's been many times in history that he's been too strong. And he's an entertaining character that in my opinion makes our game more interesting and enjoyable. That _does not_ mean we keep him viable _because_ he's interesting.\n\n> Along with him, Zed and LB.  Flashy playmakers that make flashy plays.  You've probably heard every single tinfoil hat theory that we've thrown at you guys for being corrupt and esports focused, but you can't seriously argue with the history you've stretched out in front of us can you?  You understand why a lot of us see you as a team that values flashy plays over healthy gameplay right?  \n> \n\nThis one I don't get at all. I think if you searched through most of the pro games this year, you would find Leblanc and Zed to not be nearly as dominant as say Viktor or Azir in terms of pick rate. That aside, it seems like you're creating a false dichotomy here between choosing between \"flashy plays\" and \"healthy gameplay\". I don't think we'd say someone like Zed has an inherently unhealthy pattern (I'd say he's fairly healthy for an assassin), but there's no reason why something can't be fair and flashy.\n\n> Let's talk about Cinderhulk for a bit just in general.

Tanks don't do that which prompted even more nerfs.\n\nAgain, it's really an issue of balance here. You can't argue with the level of power that Cinderhulk was giving to characters at the time. There are many reasons to like the teamfight-pacing presence that tanks give, but these champions had no tradeoffs at the time - they were becoming damage dealers with extreme durability and CC.\n\nOn that topic though, no one was happier about the success of Cinderhulk than me - that project was the combined efforts of Fearless and I (mostly him!), and I was overjoyed at the spike in competitive diversity that the Cinderhulk patch brought to the game.  But the theory that we chased away diversity by nerfing Cinderhulk is false. The diversity spike partially arose due to the uncertainty of solving the game at a pro level since we upended the meta (tanks in Jungle instead of top lane, so now carries in top lane, so now different types of supports/ADCs that have to deal with top lane carries, etc.). The pro diversity levels were already falling quickly in the weeks after Cinderhulk came out due to them solving the meta rapidly, before we even managed to get the nerfs out to the servers that pros played on. So while Cinderhulk as a disrupting force was positive in driving diversity, it couldn't ever hold that permanently - we have to keep making changes to the game to do that.\n\n> \n> Then juggernauts happened.

While I won't argue that Lee Sin is fun to play, I think it's important to make sure he's fun to play for all the right reasons.

When you see something the community is reacting so negatively to that you can't scroll 3 posts down without seeing a mention of it, it should prompt an investigation.  In fact, this would be a great idea to build off of the last paragraph; how about having one of these types of discussions we're having now with problematic champions and items or nerfs/buffs that go out to champions that we feel don't need them?  You're now going to get a feel for how the community perceives these supposed problems and would bridge the at moment hopefully slowly-shrinking ~~gap~~ chasm between player and dev.\n\nEdit: And one final though since I'm running on 3 hours of sleep and trying to form coherent thoughts, regardless of what Riot wants the believe, there are too many unhealthy/overpowered/broken/anti-fun champions in the game right now that people are either sick of dealing with or don't want to see at all.\n\nWe. Need. More. Bans.\n\nIf every person receives one ban, that's not even a twelfth of the roster, closer to a thirteenth of the roster in fact.  Would that bar the entry for newer players having to buy the new minimum champs?  Yes, and that's a good thing.  It forces you to play longer before you start up.

With that I would also recommend removing the slow on W but making his passive slow stronger, with a possibility that his passive slow becomes even stronger when he's \"fully evolved\" or when he evolves his ultimate.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Decrit","date":"2015-12-11T23:19:50.931+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you ever thought about \"Viktor-ize\" it and make it so Kha can get in the end all 4 transformations, maybe with some conditions behind? besides rengar of course.\n\nI am not a Kha player so i am not sure how much a main is attached to that, even thought it did not look like that.","replies":[{"poster":"SpecterVonBaren","date":"2015-12-11T23:35:07.286+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think they need to make it so he has more evolutions and still can't get them all, make it so the choices are more diverse and it becomes harder to reduce everything down to simply what is best.","replies":[{"poster":"Decrit","date":"2015-12-12T11:18:55.142+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, that is basically adding water to a fuel fire :P it does not solve the problem itself, rather makes the whole scenario bigger without solving anything.","replies":[{"poster":"SpecterVonBaren","date":"2015-12-12T16:01:29.241+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If there's more choice's to make, like let's say he can now get six of eight evolutions then it becomes much less of a \"Take this or fail\" kind of thing because they can make the evolutions more niche and suited to making a more unique predator.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Son Jarvan","date":"2015-12-12T01:53:11.045+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"In 5.24, both Brand and Rammus was nerfed.

Rammus lost 200-300 HP in mid-late game from Veteran's Scars+Dead Man's Plate nerfs, lost 2% damage reduction from his keystone, and lost a marginal amount of armor/MR from a low tier mastery. And yet his signature ability still lost 33% of the CC duration and the catch range. Not even scaling back in lategame, it's just permanently gone now.\n\nI know that Rammus needed a nerf.

I don't just mean this in a \"Should the Support always go bot with a Marksman\" but what do you see as the more interesting elements of the relationship when a support and ADC work together?

I think the solo Q Support/ADC relationship and the organized 5v5 Support/ADC relationship are so incredibly far apart they may as well be different games. \n\nWhat's really cool about a good duo is that they both have to constantly take \"trust falls\" in lane to be effective - you have to make a move KNOWING that if you eat a CC your partner will use a summoner at the right time to make sure the play works. The problem is that in solo q the communication is so sparse that this goes wrong fairly often, unless you're just on the same page because your game knowledge is deep enough (this is one major reason why playing ADC is so painful at lower MMR ranges). There's nothing worse than having a trust fall where your partner doesn't catch you, and it can reshape your approach to laning in a very negative way. On the other hand, when two of you are on comms together and perfectly on point, it's incredibly rewarding and one of the best experiences in League of Legends.\n\nSo, to bring it back to the designer's perspective, where do we want to strengthen the experience? Do we want to create solutions that make a better play experience for the low communication solo queue game? That would lead us to creating mechanics and items that have low coordination requirements, low failure rates, and correspondingly low rewards for success. Do we want to reward the mastery of a competent duo playing properly? Well, then this is a mechanic that has a very limited reach, as the vast majority of players will not be able to enjoy it as consistently.  When CertainlyT had to figure out how to balance Kalista's W passive, or I had to figure out how to reward Zeke's Harbinger properly, these are some of the things we had to struggle with.\n\nPersonally, I'd really love if we made another Conduit-style item like Zeke's, but opened the space up a bit for different types of duos (maybe a double melee dive buddy item, for instance).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"aperson1","date":"2015-12-11T21:04:17.247+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"You've got a pretty good track record. I don't want to knock on your teammates, but of all the Rioters I've seen on the Patch Rundown you're the one who most seems like they know what they're talking about. I think the changes you've done are pretty good and I hope you go on there to speak again soon.\n\nAnyways questions:\n\n1. We all know the various statistics you guys commonly cite for your balance decisions: playrate, winrate by elo, winrate by games played, etc. What are some less commonly cited statistics you guys use, that we might not think about on first thunk?\n\n2. A lot of balance outliers on the upper end feel like they have been hit pretty soft this preseason. I know Riot has committed to no longer \"Olaf'ing\"/\"Eve'ing\" champs but where do you draw the line between that and patches changing nothing about how the game plays?\n\n3. I was surprised to see nerfs to high-winrate low-playrate champs a.k.a \"hidden op\" champs like Malzahar this patch notes. How do you choose which champions will receive changes? Has this changed recently?\n\n4. You're probably not allowed to answer this but I've always wanted to know: which patch drove the most players away from LoL, temporarily or permanently?\n\nThanks for reading.","replies":[{"poster":"Jag","date":"2015-12-11T21:41:35.070+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Thanks man, I appreciate that.\n\n1) A few metrics here that I really like are \"win rate by game time\" and \"average experience level\".  The game time graphs will occasionally give us a very sharp idea of where to address a part of the character that is really out of control. For example, pre-5.18 Veigar tended to win a fairly small portion of games that ended at 20 minutes, and a fairly large portion of games that ended at 45+ minutes. After the buffs to his W cast time, we saw a fairly small change at the 45+ minute win rate, but a huge one at 20+ minutes, which was a large indicator to us that we had changed Veigar's power curve in a way that we were not comfortable maintaining. That directed us to looking at base damages instead of hitting the cool thing about Veigar that players really loved (the infinite scaling fantasy), and gave us a pretty solid foundation for doing so. The \"average experience level\" one is one that's really hard to convey to most players, but it basically indicates that if the vast majority of players on a champion have a huge amount of games under their belt, then we shouldn't look at a champion's win rate and be surprised if it's high. For example (these numbers aren't accurate, just using them to illustrate), if the average Riven player in your game has 70 games played on the champion, while the average Brand player has 15 games, it wouldn't be a unfair statement to say that Riven could have a higher average win rate than Brand and still be equally powerful.\n\n2) That's a tough one. I think for preseason in particular we're aware that the game is very volatile and unsolved. Optimal item builds can shift (or be nerfed...), certain exploitative strategies may be removed, and most of all, preseason is a time to just have fun and play - so I think we're reluctant to instantly smack a champion in the face unless they're fairly far out of line. Which leads me into...\n\n3) A lot of the decisions to nerf the \"hidden OP\" champs came from being fairly confident that these guys were WAY far out of line. We have a fairly significant amount of data demonstrating that these guys had pretty obscenely high levels of power in this patch.\n\n4) I don't know the answer to that question. I can tell you that I felt a lot of the same way as players did in 5.16, that the game felt pretty far off in terms of balance compared to what we've done historically. Everyone has taken a hard long at what went right and what went wrong there so we can improve on that in the future, which to me is something that's cool about how Riot - we definitely have failures, but we do our best to make them mean something positive.","replies":[{"poster":"Retillin","date":"2015-12-11T21:48:10.271+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot Jag,realm=NA,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=Nb4LwdZq,comment-id=000c0000,timestamp=2015-12-11T21:41:35.070+0000)\n>\n> \n> 3) A lot of the decisions to nerf the \"hidden OP\" champs came from being fairly confident that these guys were WAY far out of line.
