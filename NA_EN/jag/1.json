{"poster":"Jag","date":"2014-04-24T01:50:02.979+0000","title":"[4.7] Live Gameplay Patch Forecast","subforum":"Live Gameplay Balance","up_votes":22,"down_votes":4,"body":"Hi guys, the Live Gameplay team is back with the Patch Forecast for 4.7. Here are the major issues we’re looking at. Keep in mind that since we just released patch 4.6, we’re still collecting data and analyzing how the latest changes we’ve done have affected prominent in-game issues.\r\n\r\n**1) Reworks Follow-up (continued)**\r\n\r\n**Gragas** may still have a few flaws holding him back from fully transitioning into his new role as a fighter/bruiser. Even after the recent changes in 4.6, we are still unsure if Gragas is in a good spot. Specifically, we want to ensure he can compete in the early game, and also ensure he has the ability to make big plays with his Barrel Roll and Explosive Cask. We’re looking for ways to continue buffing him as a disruptive team fighter, so look for more utility adds to his kit.\r\n\r\n**Kassadin** recently received a few buffs, particularly when fighting against other magic damage dealers. We’re keeping a careful eye on Kassadin to make sure that he isn’t completely removing aspects of counterplay with his new damage/shield model. Rest assured if he gets picked in ranked games we’ll nerf him again (kidding).\r\n\r\n**Skarner** is still being worked on carefully. We feel that stickiness is a significant part of his character fantasy, and that aspect is somewhat lacking, so we’re continuing to explore solutions!\r\n\r\n**2) Top Lane and the “Renekton Bar” (continued)**\r\n\r\nAs Statikk stated in his last forecast (http://community.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/live-gameplay/BdiOr6zf-46-patch-forecast), we’re continuing to look at champions that we think have interesting top lane gameplay and giving them stronger tools to survive in that environment. We feel like we’re seeing a little more diversity lately (Jax and Ryze have seen a resurgence lately), so we'll be slowing our approach, but look for Jarvan the 4th and Malphite to get a few minor adjustments to better equip them at fighting in the top lane.\r\n\r\n**3) Jungle**\r\n\r\nWe continue to see Junglers taking over games. In particular, damage focused junglers frequently outlevel, outfarm, and outdamage their laning teammates without the level of risk that their counterparts are forced to endure. We are looking into to altering the total gold/experience output that the jungle can provide. Additionally, we mentioned that Spirit Stone might be weighted a little too heavily in favor of DPS-focused junglers (especially health vamp), so we're taking that into consideration with our changes.\r\n\r\n**4) Kha’zix**\r\n\r\nTrue to his lore, when we change Kha’zix, he evolves and finds a different gameplay pattern to continue to be effective. The live version of Kha’zix does not have the same need to be opportunistic as the other assassins in League of Legends, and opponents tend to feel like there are very few windows available to fight him. We are looking into some changes that make him a little more vulnerable to fighting back against him, particularly when he is under the effects of his ultimate.\r\n\r\n**5) Watch list**\r\n\r\n**Feral Flare** - The vision we had for Feral Flare does not currently reflect the reality of the item on live. While we were hoping this item would add diversity in terms of class selection in the jungle, its effect has been the opposite, as this item is almost dictating jungler picks (as in who can or cannot use Feral Flare effectively) at an extremely high rate. \r\n\r\nLeague of Legends team dynamics in general lead to this item having distinctly anti-teamwork and anti-play patterns, as junglers will feel compelled to ignore their lanes for 10-15 minutes so they can farm up their stacks, while their laners will pay the price for his less team-oriented choices. While we created Feral Flare to be a more 'selfish' jungle item, its current optimal use is to be completely noninteractive on the map. The future of this item may reduce some of the combat stats it gives or reduce the value of the Maim proc at all evolutions. In exchange, we're hoping to buff teamfight-oriented stacks that contribute to the progress of Feral Flare.\r\n\r\n**Soraka** – Solo lane Soraka has started to exhibit a lot of the frustrating laning patterns that Solo lane Lulu did before her recent changes (although the patterns differ mechanically). In other words, Soraka has a virtually unending supply of easy wave clear and ranged harass, while having very few windows for opponents to fight back without significant jungle help. Champions need to have clearly defined weaknesses as solo laners, or they end up bullying out a large portion of choices in that lane, and we want to do some analysis into if those currently exist for Soraka's solo lane play.\r\n\r\nAs a side note, we do think that her current rise to dominance may be due to some of the larger systems changes we've made to the game lately such as the changes to the Summoner Spell Heal. We'll have to take these into considerations as we move forward as well.\r\n\r\n**Leblanc** – Similar to previous cases like Zed and Kassadin, skilled Leblanc players have the ability to snowball games while not providing a lot of counterplay for her opponents. She has very high mobility, high burst damage, consistent wave clear, and a large array of crowd control to deal with. We’re exploring finding a vision for a Leblanc that has more healthy gameplay.\r\n\r\nOn that note, we’re aware that her win rate is on the lower side compared to many problematic champions, but win rate is a data point that must be weighed in with other considerations. In this case, the pattern in which Leblanc engages champions is frustrating and significantly lacking options for the enemy player; when she is ahead in the game this is particularly debilitating for the side lanes she will roam to.\r\n\r\n**6) On the horizon**\r\n\r\nWe are keeping our eyes on various champions that may become a problem, but many of them are tied into system level issues. Two of the major ones are ADC Itemization and Competitive lane swaps, and the systems team will also be doing a patch forecast soon for their take on these topics.","replies":[{"poster":"AnxiusFelis","date":"2014-04-24T02:16:12.293+0000","up_votes":34,"down_votes":1,"body":"Increasing the stacks needed to get flare really didn't do it any justice, as junglers will now ignore lanes for another 5 stacks.

To be clear, we are probably changing our direction of Feral Flare; the proper tradeoff may have been in reducing the stats/effectiveness of the item instead of the point at which it starts interacting with the map.","replies":[{"poster":"Glarblar","date":"2014-04-24T18:51:26.912+0000","up_votes":25,"down_votes":1,"body":"There needs to be an appropriate balance for risk/reward between farming and ganking, which {{item:3160}} currently has none.  So there are 2 problems here:\n\n1. FF's ramp up promotes behavior that is counteractive to jungler role of interacting with lanes.\n2. Once FF is created it scales out of control into late game.\n\nBalance must come from both places, let's first look at #1\n\nThe point of {{item:3160}} is to provide an item for junglers to use who do not currently benefit from the current ones, not to affect the playstyle of the jungler.  Therefore, to correct this {{item:3154}} evolution should be affected with Kills and Assists, with proper Risk/Reward, like 3 per kill/assist and 1 per large monster.  This presents the jungler with a choice in the laning phase: Do I farm more and guarantee stacks, or do I potential get a kill from a lane, granting more stacks.\n\nNow let's look at point #2\n\n{{item:3160}} is supposed to be competitive with {{item:1080}} builds so let's look at the passives:\n\n{{item:3160}}\n\nUNIQUE Passive - Maim: Basic attacks deal 100 bonus magic damage (33% against champions) and heal 10 Health on hit. This damage and heal increases with kills, assists and large monster kills.\n\nUNIQUE Passive: Gain 30% increased Gold from monsters.\n\n{{item:1080}}\n\nUNIQUE Passive - Butcher: Against monsters, deal 30% bonus damage and restore 6% of damage dealt as Health and 3% Mana.\n\nUNIQUE Passive - Conservation: Upon killing a large or epic monster, grants up to 40 bonus Gold, based on the last time Conservation triggered (Max 80 stacks of Conservation).\n\nGold Generation:\n\nFF emphasizes farming all the monsters all the time, while SS emphasizes killing a camp every so often. Consistent with the goal of the items.\n\nExtra Damage:\n\nSS helps you farm and provides a variety of base stats, however only affects monsters.  FF helps you farm EVERYTHING.  Look at this passive, there is no upper bound to it.  It is one of the most snowball items in the game, This is {{item:3141}} or {{item:3041}} ... On Steroids.  But not only does it affect damage, it affects regen too, So not only is the jungler killing everything in sight, but any damage done is recouped.  There needs to be a limit, or a tweak, or something to put this more in line with SS.\n\nSuggest: Heal only affect monsters, upper limit on stacks that can be accumulated or something to keep it contained like Mejai's or Occult.  Or buff SS to also apply to Champions?\n\nTL;DR\n\n\n1. Make {{item:3154}} earn stacks from Champion kills/assists\n\n2. Decrease Cost of {{item:3154}} to start earning stacks from Champions sooner\n\n3. Adjust number of stacks requiring {{item:3154}} to transform into {{item:3160}} in order to properly balance timing of acquisition.\n\n4. Cap {{item:3160}} to prevent it from being a snowball Item\n\n5. Tune the heal on {{item:3160}} so that it only affects Monsters, or make {{item:1080}} items affect champions and Tune both","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hyrum Graff","date":"2014-04-24T22:39:31.416+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with the \"less power, earlier\" direction.

That only leaves two possible outcomes:  \n- If your lanes are even or even winning, you win even harder now.\n- If your lanes are losing, due to the other jungler having more presence than you, you'll be hard-pressed to use the advantage you gained with FF.\n\nA good example for that are the first two the three TSM/C9 matches.","replies":[{"poster":"JimMaru","date":"2014-04-24T06:58:03.807+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"That could be true too.\nMaybe they should give the trinket treatment.\nEvolve always at lv9 but keep stacking for the damage before it.\nSince you won't see any difference until lv 9 which is halfway your leveling you should try to force getting objectives.","replies":[{"poster":"ProfDrDeath","date":"2014-04-24T07:23:19.619+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not sure about that.

They fill the void damage junglers left in the team now they have gold to build tanky.\nAlso why top lane is so stale and playing squishier characters there is sub-optimal.\n\nHaving damage-oriented junglers was a big mistake, it wraps the game around it because junglers used to have more impact on teamfights than they have now. Not as in they got to kill things, but they ENABLED their teams to do so reliably. So a jungler used to complement a team and let other picks to happen since they had synergy with them.\n\nJ4 is great at keeping people in place for AoE comps, Maokai great to counter those comps, Malph great for wombo-combos...\nWhat about Lee Sin, Trynd or Yi?\nThey are generic. They work on any comp because all they do is do damage? (lee not so much).\nThen you have to build comps around the fact that the jungler can't make plays when he ganks, you have to make the play for him...

When you get 25 stack (30 now) it improves into item that then stacks not only with monster kills but also with kills and assist. I think it is understandable that FF junglers therefore want to get FF asap, because any successful gank pre FF still feels like wasted time and only delays your power spike...\n\nThe nerf of the item in last patch, only shows that nobody in riot gave it enough thought. It was viable on about 20 junglers that have not been seen in jungle this season yet, and yes, made like 5 of them overpowered. But everyone of them was still trying to answer the question: \"Is this item viable if I dont afk farm for first 15 minutes?\", and with the change riot gave us absolute answer: \"Hell NO!\".\n\nMy proposed change would be this, if anyone is interested.\nLet the stacking start with the purchase of Madreds razor, but let he madreds razer already show you the stack count and most importantly give you a stack also for kill or assist. Then you can tweak the numbers what amount of stacks is right for FF transformation, but one fact would remain: You can now farm first five camps, go back, heal, buy madreds and start ganking. There are a lot of junglers: Nautilus, Sejuani, Xin Zhao, Lee Sin, Jax to mention just a few, that would perfectly fit this playstyle. And item would be perfect for them, as it gives them better clear speed during whole game, and keeps them viable to late game. \n\nThere would still be junglers who prefer to afk farm, but that I think is balanced trade off, as you are risking that all of your lanes would lose, which is usually situation that not even most farmed carry can save. \n\nAnother issue for the item is, how much baron/dragon control it gives over spirit stone item. I think dmg to baron and dragon could be the same as to champions - 33%. Those two monsters should be team fight objectives.

Win rates tend to be reflective of champion health, so, as an example, LB's low win rate but high effectiveness in high-level and competitive play indicates that she's got a very high mechanical skill ceiling and a very low skill floor (low skill floor meaning when she's first picked up, she's extremely hard to get rolling).\n\n[edit] as an aside, win rates tend to be \"pointers\" to health (or an inability to adapt to a current meta). Win rates are very rarely powerful indicators in and of themselves.\n\nSpitballing here but a change to LB would probably entail trying to offer more forms of counterplay (similar to S3 Zed / Fizz, who LB's play patterns roughly embody) while potentially examining her skill floor to give her more breadth in use (ie: fallback patterns when you can't execute a w-dfg-q-r-e combo in <1s).","replies":[{"poster":"Thales","date":"2014-04-24T02:16:15.389+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"That's fair.

A pity. Her playstyle promotes a poor game environment where a singular skills dictate a game. I could understand if said skill was an ultimate, and it had an associated risk (or at least was a long CD utility-only a la crystalize or wind wall) but it's a low-ish CD long range skillshot, which bugs me. The less risk Nidalee applies to the skill, the more reward it gives, which just seems so backwards. I could understand riot's hesitance to nerf the spear since it's nid's big ticket, but for a champion who supposedly sacrifices having an ult so she can have 3 additional skills, it's kinda lame that one of her skills can effect the game just as much if not more than some ultimates.","replies":[]},{"poster":"C9 Vamp13","date":"2014-04-24T05:04:39.188+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":5,"body":"you guys forgot to fix nidalee :(","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gixia","date":"2014-04-24T02:24:48.644+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"In regards to Feral Flare, I feel that one of the reasons why it promotes selfish farming to a possibly unhealthy degree is the fact that kills and assists only contribute stacks to the item AFTER it has transformed into Feral Flare.  I imagine that changing it so that kills and assists also add stacks to Wriggle's would encourage more teamplay by making it less punishing to gank a sideline, as a successful gank would no longer hinder your ability to transform the item as needed and assist your team at the same time, while maintaining at least some level of risk as a failed gank will still set you back on your farm and slow down the item completion.  Of course, doing so would ultimately make it easier to make the transition from Wriggle's to FF and would likely require some stat nerfs in order to offset this, but at the very least it would steer the item towards more interactive/healthy play patterns, would it not?","replies":[{"poster":"ProfDrDeath","date":"2014-04-24T06:26:37.423+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"This should be done carefully, for not to break the item (again).

Honestly, I'm okay with her having the strong burst she has, but not with that strong waveclear too. I'd be happy with these three changes:\n\n1. Make W no longer damage minions. This maintains her strong burst but gives her the weakness of poor waveclear\n2. Make LeBlanc have to wait at least 1s when using W before she can jump back to her original location. The QW combo in lane has no counterplay besides staying out of her range. If she has to stick around at that location, she at least has a window of vulnerability.\n3. Remove the slow on E. Whenever I play against LeBlanc, it feels absolutely impossible to get away when she lands that E, which is very easy for her to land because she can waveclear with W and silence with Q, leaving little counterplay.","replies":[]}]}
