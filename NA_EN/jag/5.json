The stuff I’ll talk about here will be on PBE for early feedback, but it’ll disappear for a couple of months after that while we work on updated VFX to go with the gameplay changes. In the meantime, we’d absolutely love for you all to scout ahead how it all feels on PBE.\n\nTo start, here are our goals:\nGive Teemo players MORE TEEMO (more poisoning, more sneaking!)\nResolve some play-against issues (mostly around Blind and Mushrooms)\nMake him a bit better at high MMR and less of a monster in low MMR\n\n\n**Let’s start with the fun stuff.** The Tl;DR:\nToxic Shot moved to Passive, and now has synergy with other poison\nGuerrilla Warfare is now Camouflage instead of Invisibility, and moved to E slot\nBlind is way more fun (and clear!)\nMore mushrooms!\n\n_Poison synergy!_\nToxic Shot is now Teemo’s passive. It will scale with Teemo’s level, and additionally will deal more damage whenever there are other Poison effects on the target. To support this, Blinding Dart now also counts as a Poison effect (in addition to his Mushrooms, which always have). You can even run Support Teemo with Cassiopeia or Twitch to really double down on the big Toxic Shot damage bonuses!\n\n_Stealth while moving!_\nSince Guerrilla Warfare is now Teemo’s E, he can enter stealth while moving, and can even move out of brush while stealthed for a limited period of time! Caveat: this is now Camouflage, instead of Invisibility (refer to our Patch 6.22 Notes). Would love everyone’s feedback on this one, but do me a favor and play it first!\n\n_Sweet new Blind trolling!_\nBlinded opponent’s basic attack missiles will fly by harmlessly (they won’t hit Teemo's allies next to him either), landing in the dirt, and melee champions will foolishly swing at air! Pictures are better than words though:\n[Ranged opponent](https://imgur.com/a/8V2wfE1)\n\n[Melee opponent](https://imgur.com/a/JBw3XJx)\n\n\n_More mushrooms!_\nMushrooms actually gain health with ability rank, making them less trivial to clear when the enemy support is paying attention to you! Additionally, we’re thinking of ways to buff the amount of mushrooms you have late game - in this iteration, Teemo actually can hold up to 3/4/5 shrooms at once.\n\n\n**Now, let’s talk about what Teemo is giving up.** If the buffs above are changes that Teemo players would welcome, then the hard part is figuring out what we’d be willing to give up. Here’s the first take.\n\n_Camouflage instead of invisibility_\nNow that Teemo can move during stealth (even out of brush), it was pretty unfair for him to fully disappear without any opponent response.\n\n_Blinding Dart damage down_\nThis version of Teemo has much better access to priority targets with his ability to move while stealthed. Consequently, his burst shouldn't come out quite as quickly.\n\n_Mushroom damage down_\nTeemo taking off more than half of a squishy champ's health from across the map with a shroom has been something we’ve been uncomfortable with for a long time, but it was his primary late game contribution so we left it alone. Given the rest of the buffs, this is worth addressing now, so we’re reducing the damage some. The upside - Teemo can actually do more damage if he’s near an enemy that trips over a mushroom, since it will amp his Toxic Shot now.\n\n_Guerrilla Warfare AS scales with E rank instead of level_\nNow that his stealth is on the E ability, it just made sense that he got AS as a level-up here. Consequently, he won’t get AS for free when leveling up (you can get it by putting points into E though).\n\n\n**Finally, regarding High MMR/organized play.** We believe that between the much higher agency Teemo's new E offers him and the fact that mushrooms are harder for organized opponents to kill, he’ll probably be just better in organized play. We’re not trying to go too hard here, but these are just light bumps to make sure he can stay competitive with the rest of the cast.\n\n\n**So, that’s most of it.** I’ll put all the specific lines below, but please hit me up with any and all feedback. Thanks!\n\nBase Stats\n-Base Mana Regen 1.92 >>> 2.5\n-Mana Regen per level 0.09 >>> 0.15\n-Mana/lvl up 20 >>> 25\n\nP\n-Teemo’s basic attacks now deal 10-50 bonus magic damage and leave a Poison DoT that deals 24-192 magic damage over 4 seconds (AP Ratio is same as live E).\n-Toxic Shot damage (both the on-hit and the DoT) is amped by 50% whenever there are other Poison debuffs on the target\n\nQ\n-Base damage down 80/125/170/215/260 >>> 80/115/150/185/220\n-AP Ratio down 0.8 -> 0.6\n-Now is a Poison Debuff\n\nW\n-No longer breaks stealth\n\nE\n-New Active: After a 1 second delay, Teemo enters Camouflage for 3-5 seconds. Teemo is slowed by 25/22.5/20/17.5/15% during this effect, and gains 20/30/40/50/60% Attack Speed for 3 seconds when it ends. Camouflage does not tick down while Teemo is in a brush or is standing still.\n\nR\n-Base Damage down 200/325/450 >>> 150/250/350\n-AP ratio down 0.5 >>> 0.4\n-Mushrooms health up from 6 at all ranks to 6/8/10\n-Mushroom max ammo count up from 3 at all ranks to 3/4/5\n\nThanks,\nRiot Jag\n\nhttps://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/9.2.1/img/champion/Kaisa.png","replies":[{"poster":"DartExplosion10","date":"2019-02-22T18:33:27.157+0000","up_votes":314,"down_votes":17,"body":"I don’t know how I feel about taking away Teemo’s invisibility completely, what about maybe giving him invisibility in brush but camouflage while out of brush?","replies":[{"poster":"Uberphish","date":"2019-02-22T18:44:24.665+0000","up_votes":96,"down_votes":16,"body":"This sounds like it would be good to me.

I actually don't see the difference, camouflage with attackspeed at end. I'd like for something unique to be added to it at the very least, like perhaps retaining full invisibility in bushes. The bush thing is kinda important since a huge part of teemo has been playing with and around bushes so far, making his stealth camo completely nullifies use inside a bush and just makes him more similar to so many other champs. \n\nWhile I haven't tried him my other complain is that his W+E combo seemingly would feel too tied together, kind of like pykes W. It seems you would just expect bonus MS while stealthed. Also his W is still a non-ability, could do more here.\n\nAlso teemo has low range, giving him strong poison and burst promoted his in and out poke nature, if you reduce his burst in favor of attack speed he will in many ways have an insane overlap with twitch, where only his ult really makes him unique in play style. \n\nIdk, hope to see something more, I'm not against changing teemo per say considering both his W and E feel like non-abilities, but I really don't thing just giving him twitch Q and removing his burst is what does it for him. Id rather you double down on him being patient and strategic with traps and immobile stealth, which is a big part of his current design, rather than yet another slippery sustained damage dealer.","replies":[{"poster":"ForTheCode","date":"2019-02-22T20:19:39.158+0000","up_votes":38,"down_votes":4,"body":"Yeah it's twitch Q but you don't get extra range with your ult, so you get annihilated.

I really like the fact that riot is trying to make him playable at a higher elo, and I'll share some thoughts. \n\nFirst, Taking away his invisibility is a huge mistake. I think it was the only good, play making potential out of the champion. \nIf you do so, you need to make the E viable. Compared to other champs, I don't think that it will be efficient enough. Slowing him down, even with the w, wont make thim able to escape, and/or gank proprely. If you take off his invisibility, you can't take away his movespeed while he is in stealth. A thought to this, would be to keep the slow, but to supress it if teemo W's while he's in his E, that way, good teemos will be able to time their spells right, as opposed to bad ones. \n\nSecond, nerfing the damage from the Q is the right thing to do, but I'm not sure about the shrooms. Putting more health on them, and more charges are great changes, maybe the cd needs to be shorter (at least late game), if the damages are that nerfed.\n\nThird, the changes with poisoning is great too, one thought, will it work with Liandry's? \n\nI'm seeing the new teemo mostly played jungle, but I was wondering where you would expect him to go.\n\nThanks for the work.\n\nChô7.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TerrorRaven","date":"2019-02-22T18:49:35.448+0000","up_votes":76,"down_votes":4,"body":"The Self-Slow on his E doesn't sound good. I don't see any reason for this (compare any other champ with a carmoflage skill get movement speed instead of losing it).

This rework looks terrible. Like, laughably so. Maybe it will play differently than it reads, but first impressions mean a lot. And my first impression after reading some of these changes is that you guys just don't care. Keep in mind these are just my (strongly worded) opinions. Feel free to disagree. \n\nPassive: Fine. I can get behind this since, to be honest, having to max out a button you couldn't even press just to have a chance of doing anything in lane felt bad. \n\nQ: The animation thing is cute, but that's really about it. I appreciate that it is now treated as a poison so Teemo has some way to stack his own passive buff. Not crazy about nerfing the damage, as it's Teemo's only damaging basic ability, but I won't lose sleep over it. I do feel the Blind debuff as a whole is honestly kind of weak and outdated, but I guess the only alternative would be to change it to a Nearsighted debuff, and that could prove problematic.\n\nW: The fact that this ability wasn't ripped off like a band-aid baffles me. Move Quick ranks as one of the worst abilities in the game. It is a bad movement speed steroid that is ONLY a movement speed steroid. Its passive is laughable, its active is useless unless maxed, and Teemo's short range as far as ranged champs are concerned means that using this offensively is inviting death upon yourself. If ANY spell in Teemo's arsenal needs attention, it's this one.\n\nE: This is a bad joke. Like, this is actually someone trolling Teemo players. \"Hey guys, what if we took the already immobile Teemo, and gave him an ability that slows him by 25% at rank 1! Oh, and we'll change his stealth to camouflage so that enemies can see him while he's running away at 25% less movement speed when they get on top of him as soon as he presses the button!\" Why?! Why would anyone ever give a champion literally named the SWIFT Scout an ability with such a crippling self slow!? In addition, why would you give a champion 2 buttons that directly contradict one another?! Why would you add anti-synergy into a champions kit? It makes 0 sense. His new E is literally Twitch's Q, but worse. And given that I'm fairly sure you'll be maxing Q first, you are stuck with this awful ability until level 13. And even then, it is still a 15% slow on yourself for now reason. This ability is bad and you should feel bad. \n\nR: Again, not fond of the damage nerfs here, but I can appreciate that something is being done to give Teemo more mushrooms with more health. I think if Teemo had a way to detonate his own mushrooms, that would more warrant a damage nerf. Or if mushrooms, when revealed by stealth detection, exploded after say 3 or so seconds, giving players plenty of time to get away. Though that would make the health changes a tad unhealthy, but it was just a spitballed idea.\n\nOver all judgement: Bad\nThis rework feels like absolutely  no thought went into it. It doesn't seem to address many of Teemo's actual problems and only makes certain problems even worse.

That means Teemo will be found and killed instantly as he wont be able to escape from enemy champions looking for him any more. You're also lowering his movement speed when he is camouflaged which means he wont be out running anyone and that's not even taking into account that it will take a full second for it to even activate and that's a long time when fighting (I see a Twitch clone attempt here) or trying to run away and survive. \n\nThe Teemo Shrooms, well, I like that you are allowing him to carry more. It makes up for that crappy timer you all reduced them to so that's a plus at least.\n\nNow for the down side to the Teemo shroom nerf, you are taking away a major part of his damage here. You are not only reducing the base damage they do but you are also reducing the AP scaling ration by a considerable margin here as well which will further weaken his presence in the game and his ability to contribute in matches. \nYou're adding more hit points to his shrooms to make them survive longer against attacks from the enemy team. Why? This does nothing in the long term to help Teemo at all. Sure, his shrooms go from taking say 3 hits to kill now to taking 5 or 6 hits to kill if that. Honestly this is a really pointless thing to do because they are meant to be traps not whatever it is you're trying to make them into. Honestly this is a major nerf to Teemo, there is just no other way to really look at this if one is to be honest.\n\nThe poison synergy thing is nice, especially so if you were not nerfing his all of his damage abilities into the ground to make up for it. Now with these changes you are forcing Teemo to be reliant  on having someone like Twitch, Cass, or Singed in the game and fighting with him to boost his damage or to have the opposing player hit a shroom and Teemo being near by with his Camo (that anyone can find him in just by walking by him) and hitting the affected target.\n\nThe Blinding Dart adding poison is a really cool idea and I really like that.\nWhat I don't like is that is that you are again nerfing his damage with it.\n\nAs to his group play, Teemo is a scout, he does hit and run attacks, split pushes, and other, well, Teemo things. He is by definition and lore not a hugely group oriented champion like you are seemingly trying to turn him into.

They feel like very simple-minded theory-crafting with little to no thought put into the big picture. You are overestimating the value of the few buffs it includes and most of them are not worth what Teemo gives up for them to even consider them a buff. You are nerfing a lot of the qualities that give him a niche for a quantity of nonsense he can't put to good use and which crosses into a territory other champions are better at. He becomes less unique and even more of a generic auto attacker too. He becomes less Teemo, rather than more. The poison changes also remind me of failed Cassio kit changes in the past, funnily enough. Teemo needs changes but he needs changes that are both worthwhile and address his problems. Those changes do none of that and in the few instances where they pretend to do so it comes at a cost that adds onto other problems or creates new ones.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gem Daddy","date":"2019-02-22T18:51:10.321+0000","up_votes":32,"down_votes":3,"body":"Having his new camouflage slow him and then having another ability just to speed him up seems very inefficient, I would say replace his W with the camo and make what used to be the poison darts a whole new ability.

With Teemo, yea he's strong in bronze, but only if you don't have the knowledge of how to defeat him. I could defeat a gank from an enemy by using my wits and knowledge as Teemo. I feel like this will just turn him into a weaker Twitch, because Teemo's kit allowed him to kill from across the map by knowing enemy pathing. Teemo requires the full knowledge of the champ and the champ he's facing. I feel like these changes are going to make Teemo obsolete, because why would I play reworked Teemo when I could just play Twitch, who would be a much stronger version of Teemo. His passive is very very good if you use it correctly. I would be playing against a really fed auto attack based ADC, and I would see them coming down mid lane so I'd hide ahead of them and then out of nowhere pop out and shut them down bettering our chances in winning. AP attack speed Teemo will be much weaker because his poison autos won't scale on AP anymore. These changes will make Teemo solely a spellcasting champ because his Q will be the only thing doing anything, the new passive will increase damage which I would love. Except, the reduced damage on his Q and R makes this change an all-around nerf to his kit. Unless they super buff his health, armor, and MR scaling and base stats, I don't see these changes doing anything, but making him like Urgot before his rework, which was useless.","replies":[]},{"poster":"jujifruits","date":"2019-02-22T21:20:26.654+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":0,"body":"Teemo is all about preplanning.

The extra charges look nice on paper but a late game Teemo dropping shrooms before capping doesn't really see \"More Shrooms\" you can \"hold\" more but you won't actually \"place\" more as opposed to live, max shrooms out is still pretty much the same.\n\n-------------------------\nNow, let’s talk about what Teemo is giving up. If the buffs above are changes that Teemo players would welcome, then the hard part is figuring out what we’d be willing to give up. Here’s the first take.\n--------------------------\n\n\nCamouflage instead of invisibility\nI'm ok if he could ACTUALLY MOVE, not crawl. Would really like to keep the invis in bushes though. \n\nBlinding Dart damage down\nAgain, another nerf because of the \"movement\" of stealth, which is really just a crawl, as his only damaging spell, the Base+AP ratio nerfs together are felt pretty hard.\n\n\nMushroom damage down\nI'm completely understanding of nerfing shroom damage, late game shrooms are really brutal. My only problem here is that Teemo has no wave clear and shrooms are his only form of wave clear. On Live you can start clearing the casters at level 11 when building AP, on PBE you're unable to clear casters until level 16. Really feels bad for trying to clear and roam, you're basically stuck in lane forever with this change.\n\nGuerrilla Warfare AS scales with E rank instead of level\nThis makes sense, a trade off in burst/dps choosing between maxing Q or E, my problem here is that you reach 60% AS later than you would on live, and on Live you can get to 80% AS which you know longer get with this new version.\n\n\nAll in all, I really like the direction of the changes, I've expected nerfs or a rework for Teemo for some time. There definitely needs to be some adjustments on the numbers, and I strongly feel like the self slow on the stealth is very unneeded. For reference, Twitch gets a 10sec stealth with a 10-30% MS buff at rank 1. Teemo's rank 5 stealth is 5 seconds and self slows by 15% completely negating his move quick ability EVEN if you activate move quick you're still slower until you have both abilities maxed. It feels -really- bad.\n\n\n\nNow these are just what I saw from play testing for a day, on a side note, his poison DoT is not doing the damage values it displays, it's actually doing much lower damage. Tested this on dummies and also on minions with 0 MR, the values are much lower at later levels. \n","replies":[]},{"poster":"4n41","date":"2019-02-22T23:58:09.853+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't like any of this, frankly.\n\nThe moving stealth is not part of Teemo's niche and is not welcome to me.

I'm not a Challenger level player like everyone else on Reddit, instead I'm trash who made it to Plat 2 > Plat 1 Promos last season and am currently in Plat 4 with the few games I've felt like playing in this season due to really bad matchups bumming me out and the positional matchmaking making my fill games meaningless.\n\n\nI'll start with the things I like:\n\n\n* Putting his poison as his passive is a great idea. His strong point has always been \"stack a shroom, hit some poison and ignite and tick down the enemy\" and I believe that being able to let him have this poison while also leveling up blind first will significantly help his laning phase in the higher elos (though I think this will be harder for low elo players to deal with).\n* Q procs poison. Assuming I read this right, the Q should add a stack of passive to the enemy now. Another great change that I've been wanting for a while.\n* Camouflage really helps with Teemo's ganking potential\n\n\nNow for the things I don't like:\n\n\n* I'm going to start with the big problem: His R. It seems with every year that passes by, there are more and more ways for players to detect traps and wards (sweeper, duskblade, pink wards, etc). The issue with mushrooms is two fold: In low elo, players don't know how to ward or clear traps, so an ultimate like his mushrooms feels broken due to no one knowing how to use these mechanics. Once you hit gold, people start knowing how to clear better, so it's not quite as toxic for the enemy team to deal with. Platinum and above, however, people can clear his mushrooms fairly easily. There's really not much help from shrooming an objective anymore when all of your mushrooms can be cleared in 10 seconds because the enemy team naturally has a player with duskblade and 1 or two players have a sweeping orb. The higher damage was the only thing, imo, keeping this ability somewhat balanced in high elo, since it punished a player's mistake and could force an enemy adc or mage to go back, allowing your team to start a 4 v 5 fight. The mushroom health is meaningless since once a shroom is detected, it's cleared instantly. **I'd much rather see his mushroom timer increase per rank than the amount he can carry, since his shrooms are mostly glorified wards at this point. 5/6/7 minutes respectively. I also think lowering the ap ratio -and- base damage is an overkill, especially since you are also lowering the burst damage from the Q by a lot. Lower one, sure I guess, but please not both (I think lowering the base damage is best)** If Riot truly insists on the quantity over quality approach, then make his ammo count go 3/4/6, so you can at least protect an objective or your base via numbers now while the mushrooms themselves deal much less damage.\n* Losing invisibility in brush is huge. I think allowing him to keep invisibility while in brushes wouldn't hurt him, considering these changes would make him lose a lot of damage output (which is really the only way he's able to survive half the time).\n* No ap scaling on the poison passive also murders a lot of Teemo's damage output. Teemo is only barely hanging onto being played because he can exert a high amount of damage if he flanks or goes unnoticed. Late game he's still viable because from just his aa alone he can do 200+ damage on hit, not even counting any bonuses like Nashor's tooth, red buff, the poison DoT itself, etc. Yes, his damage output is now buffed from poison procs, but this doesn't compensate enough for high elo where if you blink you're dead. **My suggestion would be to add a 0.1 or 0.2 ap ratio onto his passive (both on hit and DoT). It's a small amount but adds up steadily, which I think is the direction Riot wants to take Teemo. It won't make the burst too high for lower elo but won't completely butcher Teemo in high elo.**\n\n\nOdd thing I noticed and personal suggestion:\n\n\n* His W seems counter intuitive with his new E ability, as W is simply there to give passive movement speed (usually to chase enemies or engage) while the E lowers that movement speed but is... also primarily an engagement tool? I think having two abilities with the same use that contradict each other isn't very helpul for Teemo's kit as a whole. Honestly, I think you can actually **combine these two abilities by having him get passive movement speed at all times (when not damaged and only while he's visible) and have the active be a much smaller movement speed boost and attack speed boost (when coming out of stealth), and have his E be a whole new ability completely, like a scouting ability where he makes use of his telescope (he is a scout, afterall)? He could scout an area in a line or cone in front of him (slightly smaller range than Xerath's Q) and reveal enemies in bush and also allow himself and allies to deal increased damage to enemies scouted by Teemo for the next few seconds. This could also work well with Teemo's own kit, as he can then get a small damage bonus from his poison bonus as well as a small \"scout bonus\" to help out his nerfed damage ratios and also increasing his survivability in enemy territory. This being a \"skill shot\" ability will also make a bigger difference for Teemo being used in low elo vs high elo, a difference that is more than just numbers and ratios.**","replies":[]},{"poster":"LowKeyMLG","date":"2019-02-22T19:38:15.600+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just a random thought but I think it would be an interesting mechanic if Teemo could target his shrooms with his q loading them with blinding poison.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Teimo","date":"2019-02-22T19:42:02.965+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":2,"body":"To be honest, what's the point of giving him a mobile stealth if there's no burst combo damage at the end of it, this is a huge nerf to teemo imo.\nlook at shaco, look at twitch, see how easily they would die after their stealth if they didn't have a one shot combo?\nand his stealth can't be used as a mean to escape because you guys literally added a slow during the stealth.\n\nTeemo is already oppressed out of lane against tanks that build full mr as it is, he used to be a lane bully but now in high elo you have to play passively and farm until the lane phase is over, and that's before these nerfs.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shunye","date":"2019-02-23T01:33:07.448+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":0,"body":"to be honest, none of these changes feel like buffs.

Teemo is slowed and only lasts 3-4 sec.

Right now i think the camouflage is quite good as you can easily burst a squishy and get out. I think this new version will be more accesible and all-round useful.  Thats the best change yet. The unfortunate thing that will be going away with this stealth change is that there will be no more camouflage outplays. Stealthing in the middle of the lane and waiting for that squishy to show up, or stealthing in the side of the lane and waiting for the laner to walk into your mushroom isnt gonna be a thing anymore. I could totally see why that needs to go though as it can feel unfair to play against.\n\nThe thing i massively dislike is the ap ratio and shroom changes. Currently and historically teemo has been awful at building AP. He rather builds magic pen because he just doesnt scale that well with AP. Liandrys + Sorc, Oblivion orb and void staff will give more damage then deathcap could. With the AP Ratio nerfs you are moving teemo from an assasin poison mage playstyle to a generic on-hit champion. Not only that but moving teemo away from his mushroom playstyle goes against what teemo inherently is. There is a dedicated playerbase who play teemo for his mushrooms, thats his identity. I dont think its fair to move teemo away from that. Mushrooms is what makes teemo unique, and is what makes teemo - well, teemo. Please please keep this in mind, his mushrooms are teemo.\n\nbrainstorming here: What about making teemo's mushrooms leave behind a cloud of poison  (when walked over) that slows and damages those who stand in it ? It would solve the instant damage issue but still make teemo able to zone enemies, follow up on good shroom placement and contribute in teamfights.

Even back in the day, if somebody spent 500 gold on oracles, you could focus them so that you could continue putting down your dominance in the areas you're strong in, securing objectives and making the jungle a scary place to walk into alone. With oracles being what it is now, it's not uncommon for 3 players on the enemy team to oracles every mushroom you have off the map, and adding 3 more health wont do anything to prevent that, especially if they space their oracles out and even with 45% CDR, you cant put down as many mushrooms as you need to before they're swept again. There needs to be some form of exception for him and his mushrooms that oracles cant see, if you're going to take away damage from the areas he's strong in and what makes his kit work.\n\nA real escape, making him immune to slows when he uses his W, something, he needs **something** to help him feel like the counterpick he's supposed to be rather than getting pulled by a no-item Darius and dying because you literally cant do anything but flash, and chances are he'll flash ghost on you and kill you regardless. Give him something, he needs something else than what you're trying to do.
