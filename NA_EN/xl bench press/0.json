Similarly, I also wonder how he scales with stacking ults, such as Veigar&#039;s Primordial Burst.\r\n\r\nSo let&#039;s say Sylas is super fed.  He steals {{champion:126}}  ult, which gives him regular Jayce abilities.  Will those abilities now deal as much damage as if Jayce we equally fed?  How would they even calculate that in terms of what items Jayce could have potentially built?\r\n\r\nOr, for example, you are a fed Sylas and you steal {{champion:104}} ult.  Will Collateral Damage now be super strong, or will it only be as strong as the Graves from whom he stole the ult?\r\n\r\nOr, to go back to the {{champion:45}} example - does Sylas also effectively steal the amount of stacks the enemy Veigar has built when he steals &amp; uses his ult?\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, what if Sylas is behind, and steals an incredibly fed Veigar&#039;s ult?  \r\n\r\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}}","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-01-15T09:00:38.694+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Sylas\n\n> All Hijacked ultimates and abilities that do not scale with ability power have their attack damage ratios converted to ability power ratios, scaling with 0.7% AP per 1% total AD, and 0.5% AP per 1% bonus AD.\n\nVeigar's ult doesn't have stacks. It's an ordinary spell. The stacks come from his passive, which grants AP. Veigar's ult simply scales off of that AP. Sylas won't steal that passive.","replies":[{"poster":"Kai Guy","date":"2019-01-15T09:13:20.946+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ce4MyWsmaBo&t=412s","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jaspers","date":"2019-01-15T09:37:21.594+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wait, that's a thing? That's stupid. Renekton has an AP scaling in his ult he'll never use and Sylas who could be stupid enough to steal a AD scaling ult is compensated for it? If he steals the Jarvan's ult over the Malphite's for example, that should be his own fault and he shouldn't be rewarded for picking the wrong one.\n\nI was took obsessed with his silly heal to read that. :P","replies":[{"poster":"HommeGoujon","date":"2019-01-15T13:03:50.619+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What if the enemy team only has AD scaling ults though?

Well done the other team picking a good team comp against him. He shouldn't be rewarded for the other team counter picking. He's already going to get more use out of Renekton, Ornn and Malphite's ults than they usually do, in exchange for him being able to use some champs ults better than they can (because they don't build AP, are ultility or scale on something they don't build), he shouldn't have any scaling on AD ults unless they have an AP scaling or he's building AD. A fair trade, surely?","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Madjack01","date":"2019-01-15T09:03:47.333+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The ults he steals only scale with his own stats and he can't steal passive effects (usually).\n\nDon't quote me on that but I believe he converts half of his ap into ad for physical ults.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dynikus","date":"2019-01-15T09:00:26.621+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sylas uses his own stats for any ultimate he steals.

Kinda curious because his passive scales on AD (for whatever reason).","replies":[]},{"poster":"XL BENCH PRESS","date":"2019-01-15T09:24:14.185+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the explanation!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"WoÎ˜xer","date":"2019-01-15T09:44:19.282+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If u see Sylas, better dont take Pyke into him.","replies":[]},{"poster":"XL BENCH PRESS","date":"2019-01-15T09:23:11.494+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nice one thanks all :)","replies":[]}]}
