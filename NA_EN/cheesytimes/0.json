I have never in all my time playing League of legends use a 3rd party software for any sort of reason on any of my accounts. I am very angry and displeased that I have been banned for such a thing. I was playing on my account today (2016,01,11) at my college and about 8 hours later when I get home from school I have my account banned. This makes no sense what so ever and I would like to have my account back please. I have been playing League of Legends since Season 3 and have bought tons of RP. I have done nothing wrong. I have never used any sort of 3rd party software to gain any advantage on players or in general. I do not understand why I have been banned?? This is honestly unbelievable. I have been playing League of Legends for 3 years and never got banned. I have been toxic in the past and I got my rightful chat bans for it and served my time for what I did. But this, this is ridiculous. I have never used anything to cheat or give an unfair advantage to any players. I have worked very hard to achieve the rank that I have and spent countless amount of money and time into this account and I would appreciate if I would be able to get it back. As I have done nothing wrong.","replies":[{"poster":"mirageofpenguins","date":"2016-01-14T22:38:56.062+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heya CheesyTimes,\n\nAs some other players have correctly identified, you were having your account boosted during the detection period (mid-October, specifically).
