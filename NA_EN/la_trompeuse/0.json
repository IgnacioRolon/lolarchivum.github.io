Besides, she has **yet to receive a skin for a long time** too and she **doesn&#039;t have any Legendary / Ultimate skins** so she qualifies for a new skin too. \nThe ideas and artworks by [Riot Hylia](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/player/NA/Riot%20Hylia) are also clearly represented in aspect of Splash Art and In-Game model so all the more this LeBlanc skin concept should be carefully considered to be made into a real skin, also putting in the thought of how much time and effort [Riot Hylia](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/player/NA/Riot%20Hylia) has actually put in to be able to come up with this skin concept. _(P.S.
