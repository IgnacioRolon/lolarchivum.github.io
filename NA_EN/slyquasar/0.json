Taric has an ult that lasts 2 seconds yet covers the entire team. Very similar except in the one second extra on kayle ult. The use of Kayle ult is also extremely lacking since Black Shield from Morgana can do everything that Kayle&#039;s ult can do as well and more. Black Shield is also on only an 8 second CD. I think that Kayle&#039;s Ultimate needs to have a lower cd, maybe to 20 seconds at max rank with 40% cdr. Or lengthened to the same time frame of Tryndameres ult or Black Shield.","replies":[{"poster":"Meep Man","date":"2018-01-09T22:47:21.301+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because the person the ult is attached to is Kayle and not Taric","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-01-09T22:39:57.754+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Because it is an incredibly powerful ult, and 2 seconds is already absurd when you use it on an ADC or bruiser at the right time.\n\nBlack shield is anti CC, it does nothing to stop physical damage and only blocks minor magic damage..\n\nAnd that is when i  realized this is a troll post.","replies":[{"poster":"Colton147","date":"2018-01-09T23:25:56.471+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MagicFlyingLlama,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=xmqZBkAt,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2018-01-09T22:39:57.754+0000)\n>\n> Because it is an incredibly powerful ult, and 2 seconds is already absurd when you use it on an ADC or bruiser at the right time.\n> \n> Black shield is anti CC, it does nothing to stop physical damage and only blocks minor magic damage..\n> \n> And that is when i  realized this is a troll post.\n\n{{champion:23}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cloud273","date":"2018-01-09T23:20:18.290+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MagicFlyingLlama,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=xmqZBkAt,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2018-01-09T22:39:57.754+0000)\n>\n> Because it is an incredibly powerful ult, and 2 seconds is already absurd when you use it on an ADC or bruiser at the right time.\n> \n> Black shield is anti CC, it does nothing to stop physical damage and only blocks minor magic damage..\n> \n> And that is when i  realized this is a troll post.\n\nIt's really not that good. All you have to do is save your cc until after she ults and you beat Kayle.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SlyQuasar","date":"2018-01-09T23:02:41.879+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Morgana's shield stops 350 damage at base with no added AP and scales at 70%. It also Nullifies many ults like Amumu's for an example. Also that 2 seconds is nothing for a Kayle ult because you can still be CC during the Bubble. If you couldn't be CC during this time i could see an argument for your case but there is not one. Kayle's ult needs a buff.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Tyrone Lannister","date":"2018-01-09T22:46:31.625+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I dont wanna live in a world where Kayle becomes pick/ban worthy again.

Unfortunately she is hell to play against, especially someone who knows Kayle well. If there's anything id change, it would be her W because overall its a lackluster ability that could be so much more.","replies":[{"poster":"SlyQuasar","date":"2018-01-10T20:57:28.389+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She is hard to play against in some top lane matchups, sure i will agree to that. However, in this day in age so many top laners now also have long range spells and gap closers. So many champions counter her now that its insane. Even Kayn's ultimate lasts longer than her shield so he can just stay in you until its over. I think if anything the cd needs to be increased a little while the length of the effect lasts at least as long as a Tryndamere ult does.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"KVbqbFsC8e","date":"2018-01-09T23:28:42.250+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This must be some sort of joke.
