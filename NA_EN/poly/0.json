I love the champion, but honestly right now I&#039;m really considering not playing him anymore. Morellonomicon and other constantly applied healing debuffs are too brutal. He is meant to lifesteal to stay alive. He has no kit to avoid damage or hide away in stealth or jump away or really do anything besides get kited to death. (It is pathetically easy to play around his ult.) So he is meant to stay alive by sticking close and lifestealing. (Which is actually pretty hard against a good team. And just plain impossible against a team that has a Morello.)\r\n\r\nNow here is my main issue -\r\nFirst off, let me say I don&#039;t mind Grievous Wounds being applied from ignite. Because if nothing else you can buy a quiksilver sash (Not that I endorse this) and get rid of it or at least wait for the Grievous Wounds to be over. But you cant do that against Morellonomicon or any constantly applied healing debuff. It has no element of timing. Nothing to play around. No match up of skill. It just simply shuts Olaf down. There is no counter play whatsoever. It takes the fun out of the game. I like the idea of ignite or exhaust shutting Olaf down temporarily because it is something that can be played around, but a constant healing debuff is too brutal to deal with.\r\n\r\nI do not understand how Olaf is supposed to do anything if he loses his passive magic resist and armor when rushing in. Because even though he is immune to cc. He is severely gimped by Grievous Wounds. (Grievous Wounds is fine. As long as it is not something that is constantly applied and re-applied.)\r\n\r\nHonestly right now at low health Olaf is deceptively weak.\r\n\r\nIf Olaf ults right now. He turns into a squishy that dies against any team that knows what they are doing.\r\nIt&#039;s already so hard for Olaf to even reach his targets during a fight because so many champions have so much mobility. So having no counter play to Grievous Wounds really hurts him.\r\n\r\nSo I guess my real point is- Please show Olaf some love. I have played thousands of Olaf games across different accounts. And I may not be that good, but I understand that there is a problem with him right now.\r\n\r\nHere are some options. Any one of these would help.\r\n-Give his Ult a movespeed bonus. (This would help. but it&#039;s honestly kind of meh to me.)\r\n\r\n-*Let him be immune to Grievous wounds for the six second duration of his ult. (I really think this has to be implemented. Or at least make Morellonomicon/any other constantly applied Grievous Wounds source not absolutely destroy him without even the ability for counter play)\r\n\r\n-Let him keep some armor and magic resist when he ults. I actually really like the idea of Olaf having to choose between being squishy with a lot of damage, or tanky with not so much damage, but at this point in time neither really matter because he gets kited and killed (Especially by Grievous Wounds) either way. Isn&#039;t the point of him ulting to be able to stick on top of carries without dying instantly?\r\n\r\n-OR Give Olaf wings to fly away to Valhalla where he can finally rest in peace knowing that he won&#039;t have to deal with any more healing reduction.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m really not expecting to be heard but I really would be ecstatic if I got a response from Riot about why or why not they are working on this issue.\r\n\r\nOn a side note. Why is there no healing reduction options for ad characters (besides ignite) if ap characters have Morellonomicon?","replies":[{"poster":"Reinou","date":"2015-05-04T13:58:17.256+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Tanky Olaf does tons of damage.\n\nDoesn't care about Griv.
