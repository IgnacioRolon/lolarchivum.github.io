While some energy users do have poke, its not exactly equal to lets say a mages poke. For example most mages either do more dmg comparing 1 ability for another, or they have better \"utility\" (using this fairly loosely to cover cc,aoe, and range) Almost all energy users  abilities are either meant to be used in close range or are purely for burst. Zed for example who probably has the most range misses out on alot of dmg unless he is able to proc electrocute or hits them directly instead of through minions. With his poke combo (W-E-Q) he only has enough energy to press E once more once its off cd then thats it, he is completely out of energy until it regens. (though he does get refunded energy if it hits multiple people) While mages can do their full combo many times before they run out of mana, and some can even do the same combo multiple times before zed gets his energy back such as ryze, and cass. There are many other examples on why some champs use energy over mana, im just naming a few of the pros and cons of both sides.\n\nEnergy users typically dont do well at all in poke especially in the late game as most are designed to be assassins. Late game mages such as Xerath, Vel, and Brand can do full combos non stop until they run out of mana depending on their items. Mana is by design more suited for late game while energy is more suited for either early game or burst.\n\nI dont expect you to be convinced by this or anything anyone says. Im just pointing out there are two sides to every coin. It might just help to look at both sides before complaining about one.\n\nAlso by your logic mana users shouldnt be able to burst. :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"Stars Shaper","date":"2019-05-21T06:48:01.762+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":30,"body":"Yasuo poke requires 2 hits and is rather telegraphed though.","replies":[{"poster":"SuicidePlank","date":"2019-05-21T06:51:08.796+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":10,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Stars Shaper,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=q8hpwkqB,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2019-05-21T06:48:01.762+0000)\n>\n> Yasuo poke requires 2 hits and is rather telegraphed though.\n\nNo, he just needs to press Q.\nIf you are Melee and want to farm you can't avoid it.","replies":[{"poster":"NemeBro","date":"2019-05-21T07:40:38.709+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":13,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Laufplanke,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=q8hpwkqB,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2019-05-21T06:51:08.796+0000)\n>\n> No, he just needs to press Q.\n> If you are Melee and want to farm you can't avoid it.\n\nBuddy, you main Gangplank.\n\nYou have point and click poke from a longer range than Yasuo's that, get this, does literally the exact same damage (unless they crit, in which case Gangplank's does MORE), and if you can use your barrels well does even more damage and is even longer range.

Like he usually does, every season.\n\n\n> calling him one of the best gangplanks is hilarious though, watching him vs a challenger gp player from korea is like night and day.\n\nIn terms of knowledge yes, but mechanically he is one of the best GPs out there, which was my point.\nAlso when did you ever watch Tobias Stream? If you missed him hitting GM, neither Master (and playing even on stream on it), it can't be to recent and I mean the last two years.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"DaTrout77","date":"2019-05-21T07:01:42.757+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":6,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Laufplanke,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=q8hpwkqB,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2019-05-21T06:51:08.796+0000)\n>\n> No, he just needs to press Q.\n> If you are Melee and want to farm you can't avoid it.\n\nbesides just dodging it.","replies":[{"poster":"Heko The Man","date":"2019-05-21T07:04:04.765+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=DaTrout77,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=q8hpwkqB,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2019-05-21T07:01:42.757+0000)\n>\n> besides just dodging it.\n\nhe can use it when ure going to last hit a minion, you can't dodge it in that momemnt cause u'll be stationary for a sec.","replies":[{"poster":"DaTrout77","date":"2019-05-21T07:08:00.139+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":9,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Heko The Man,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=q8hpwkqB,comment-id=0000000000000001,timestamp=2019-05-21T07:04:04.765+0000)\n>\n> he can use it when ure going to last hit a minion, you can't dodge it in that momemnt cause u'll be stationary for a sec.\n\nyou will be stationary for a fraction of a second, and he has a windup time to cast it so its telegraphed and he has to time it damn near perfectly for it not to be dodgable.

GP cd on Q is 5 seconds while yasuo's Q is 4 seconds until he gets attack speed.

Does your champ have a ranged ability you can use to either farm or trade dmg back? Does your champ have any sort of tankiness or sustain mechanic? \n\nJudging from your match history you only play GP so you have both a sustain ability (W) a ranged poke used for either trading or farming (Q) (E). all that aside if the yasuo is simply sitting on the minions waiting for you to walk up then that is free poke and gold for you as GP since you always are running klepto. Honestly your complaining about a brain dead yasuo just sitting on the minions letting you poke and farm all you want? \n\nYou are one strange cookie... :D","replies":[{"poster":"Paletongue","date":"2019-05-21T14:34:52.115+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Looking up someone else's champions is deflecting from the problem we are discussing currently.

Also this wasnt a personal attack in the slightest.

An earlier post said \"Buddy, you main Gangplank.\", which my apologies, I thought was you. Regardless, you followed up on his point where you zoomed in on a specific situation between Gangplank v Yasuo. Unfortunately this post isn't supposed to be about Gangpank at all, and only about how Yasuo can be difficult against melee tops as a whole. While you didn't start the deflection yourself (that was NemeBro), you did continue it, and thus continue the invalidation of his opinion simply because he mains Gangplank.\n\nAlso, I liked the strange cookie part","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Heko The Man","date":"2019-05-21T07:24:09.115+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=DaTrout77,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=q8hpwkqB,comment-id=00000000000000010000,timestamp=2019-05-21T07:08:00.139+0000)\n>\n> you will be stationary for a fraction of a second, and he has a windup time to cast it so its telegraphed and he has to time it damn near perfectly for it not to be dodgable.
