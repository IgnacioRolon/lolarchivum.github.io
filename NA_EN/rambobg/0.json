We investigated internally, and it looks like there was a problem on the back-end several days ago causing matches to either be severely delayed in loading or just straight missing.  We have resolved the issue and now the system is hard at work back-filling these matches and displaying them properly.  It may take a couple of days yet before it is all back to normal however!","replies":[{"poster":"RamboBG","date":"2016-05-18T17:54:30.396+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"nice dude thx \ni will wait few days and will replay again if is work or not :)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"KamaainaDiscount","date":"2016-05-16T23:03:56.083+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=dArtagnan,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=WWvWmwlT,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-05-16T21:30:55.616+0000)\n>\n> When I open that link, I see the match history details loaded.

It has the leagueoflegends.com background but lacks any content within the body.\n\nThis seems to be the case for about a week now, maybe longer.","replies":[]}]}]}
