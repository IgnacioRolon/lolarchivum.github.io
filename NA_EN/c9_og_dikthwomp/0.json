For some reason it tends to BSOD (blue screen of death) while I am playing league. Due to the whole computer shutting down I am unable to receive a bugsplat message and it is counted as going afk.  I have checked my computer several times and there is nothing wrong with it. I have also checked the specs on my league client and in game options and they are all at the minimum possible to try to help my computer, (which it shouldnt have to since there is nothing wrong with it). \r\n\r\nAnyways, Due to riot's incredibly ignorant AFK rules I end up with having to wait in 20 minute timers to then go into queue due to leaver buster. I have brought my case to Riot's attention several times and they either refuse to respond or refuse to help.\r\n\r\nSo what i wanna know is: \r\n\r\nWill Riot change its AFK policy such that in times of BSOD, a gamer will no be punished?\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\nWill Riot atleast act like they care about their community and try to help me with this problem? I believe I have sent in atleast three help tickets already, with either no response or no help given. (The only response i get back is to go to a link so i can check the rules on afk)","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-16T23:35:27.093+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Regardless of the reason for the disconnection, your absence negatively impacts *everyone in the match*. This is a big factor as to why the system treats all disconnections equally and why we are unable to remove penalties associated with it. We understand that sometimes emergencies happen, but a *consistent trend* of disconnections is not reasonable and can result of low-priority queues.\n\nBSOD's don't typically happen to healthy computers and they typically happen as a result of driver or hardware issues with the PC.
