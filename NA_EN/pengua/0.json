At its worst, _which is randomly realized_, a single critical strike can define a game - especially on feast or famine characters - in either direction. Individual attacks have high meaning in League and having that action not be controlled when most of the rest of the game is feels a bit wrong.\nAnd to be further clear it's not the RNG element that's wrong here; it's the RNG element compounded by the reaction window afterwards. RNG that guides strategy and decision making but doesn't define individual events are amazing (Bard meeps <3). Short response window RNG is the icky one.\n\n... However...\nCritical strike also does a lot of good things.\nTo highlight these, I would like to call out and contrast some of the effects of Critical Strike to the most common suggestion in changing it: Flattening the output. (Flattening the output is where Critical Chance becomes a basic attack damage multiplier. 1% Crit -> 1% Basic attack damage amp).\n\nIn the broadest of theory, assuming all actions are the same, just changing one for the other would (given that there's lots of games being played) would statistically be the same.\nHowever, that wouldn't actually be true. Not all actions would be the same. Here are some of the key differences (in no particular order):\n\n1. Critical chance proposes a degree of possible threat that people **do** respond to. An ahead Marksman will be more reluctant to engage on a Marksman that's behind and has a bit of crit because of the chance of a crit still sits in the realms of possibility. This allows a behind Marksman to still project some control whereas if all damage was flattened this would be less true.\n\n2. There is an interaction with critical strike that I will call \"crit fishing\". Crit fishing is where someone will poke the enemy and then hard engage if they see a critical strike. If they don't, they back off (with the enemy sustaining back up a bit). Even though what's being tried is luck (ish, thanks to pseudo-rng it will actually be guaranteed eventually), there's a skill and a mini-game wrapped around it on capitalizing on the event. This entire mini game doesn't occur with a flattened damage situation.\n\n3. Thanks to pseudo-RNG, when there is a decent amount of crit (but not max) on a character in a full team fight where Marksman get to hang around for awhile then the fight will have a mix of crits and noncrits. In mid to late game, given the high damage outputs that Marksman have, this can be pretty defining. The marksman **will** crit someone into being into burst range, the question is \"who and can it be acted on?\" This is an element of unpredictability and interaction with other classes of characters (burst mages) that is very similar to point #1, but stretched even further and with a proper response window for teams to react and decide if and how they hold their engagement or disengage. This flowing and shifting long fight dynamic would be lost with the flattened version.\n\n4. One of the hardest ones to capture: the _feeling_ of crit. When a crit occurs, for a lot of people it's fun. The number is larger, there's an awesome fiery icon next to the damage, the damage number moves differently, your champion does different things (animation and sometimes sound), and the enemy health bar takes a heavier chunk. Each of these aspects feed off of each other. There are an ensemble of elements executing this feeling and the shift itself between adagio to allegro is what matters. Having just one or the other can be quite boring for many.\n\nI'm sure there are more things crit is doing as well. These are just some major ones that have been partially understood.\n\nNow, what the value of each of these aspects are is much more difficult to define and emulating them all becomes rather complicated.\nUnlike, say, the dodge mechanism or the phage random slow mechanism of many days past, critical is also much more ubiquitous which makes trying to understand these values much more important.\nAll of that said, it might turn out that the right answer is just flattening it - or any number of other ideas. The bad of Crit might just be straight up worse than all of these elements combined. However, I can't say with confidence that that's true.\nTricky area.

This entire mini >game doesn't occur with a flattened damage situation.\n\nI have to disagree again...if you get rid of crit-fishing you still will see short or long trades, but those depend on playing around ability cooldowns and abusing misspositioning or wavecontrol perfectly instead of just pushing ones luck.

I don´t see where that proper window would be if your support gets blown up by 3AAs from an ADC featuring 40%Crit at random within 1,4seconds.\nAgain...i don´t see why playing around Ability-CDs and Positioning (+wavecontrol on the makro level) should be insufficient. All that Crit-RNG will acconplish is that eventually the team that manages to have both sidelanes push in their favour during the standoff and get´s a perfect initiation off still can get punished for being the better team because the opponent ADC randomly blows up their frontline while their own struggles with a streak of non-crits.\n\n>One of the hardest ones to capture: the feeling of crit.

I think you are way to onesided here....the feeling of Crit is still a very onesided joy for the one dealing the Crit whereas it´s just frustrating for the receiving party nontheless. Very similar to dodge actually (I mean...being invulnerable as Jax felt great, no doubt there).\n+ you can shift the crit-animations over to sheen proccs, thus enabling the feeling for aps and tanks aswell (especially Maokai...that guy has such a badass headbutt and you can´t ever see it outside of bravery matches)...and for ADCs you can code the dmg such that the higher the numbers get they change size and colour.

I was almost completely won over by the above Rioter but after reading your post it really dissuades any of the \"positives\" of crits he mentioned.\n\nThe whole \"snowball deterrence\" thing was never something my mind would factor in when going hard on someone with a small amount of crit. I just see my abilities and stats vs their abilities and stats and determine that I have a pretty good chance of success but when my failure is determined by a crit I don't think that I forgot to factor it in --  I instead think \"That's such BS that he got a lucky crit there, _I should have won that_\". And I think that's the biggest reason why it shouldn't exist. That is the opposite of a positive decision making tool. It creates unnecessary uncertainty in luck and chance -- things that are definitely not needed when determining whether you can win a fight or not.\n\nI think it comes down to this: Luck based on skill is fully welcome (via lucky dodges and such) but luck based on chance is not.\n\nSo if snowball deterrence is really needed beyond the non-crit tools already provided -- such as dodging and landing skills -- then simply provide more tools for use in skillfully outplaying an opponent who is slightly ahead instead of using the threat of random chance as the deterrence.

Marksmen are late-game carries, mid game is the time for AP carries and assassins to shine. This would be made much better by the % damage increase because it would not be something you could get so much use out of on only three items. The % damage increase items would cement carries as six item fighters, not three item fighters.\n\nPoint B) Marskmen are sustained damage carries that need peel. They SHOULD NOT have burst damage unless it is part of their kit (Tristana, Graves). IE creates these weird situations where you get lots of extra damage simply by attacking once, and yes, that might not affect the overall damage you would have dealt in the fight, but it definitely shortens it. \n\nSay you have a target with 1000 HP, and you have 1.0 Attack Speed and 100 AD (and they have 0 armor, for the purposes of this discussion). Normally it would take you 10 seconds of dedicated auto attacking to kill the enemy champion. But, with Infinity Edge giving you a 20% chance for 250% bonus damage, that would in theory reduce the amount of time to 9 seconds (400 from 4 autos, then 250, then 400 from another 4 autos) but it _could_ reduce it to as little as 4 seconds or it could not reduce it at all! You can't plan around that, and that's disadvantageous to the carry, as well as poorly telegraphed to the person being attacked.\n\nPoint C) The damage from auto attacks should be standardized for clarity's sake. This is a big one. If I'm getting auto'd by a mage, or auto'd by a tank, or auto'd by a fighter, I watch my health, see how much damage each auto deals, and do my best to dodge any skill shots while I keep up pressure, while also watching the map for potential aid or incoming enemies, watching their health to see if I can kill them, watching my cooldowns and my summoner cooldowns...that's a lot of information to process at once. You know what messes all that up? Random chance. Want to talk about crits not being skillful in and of themselves? Try interfering with skillful play. When you remove _consistency_ because that's what it is, not predictability, _consistency_ from a game, that game becomes harder to play. And that is through no fault of the player. The player is not given the information of how much a critical strike auto will deal until it happens. This is _especially_ problematic when you are completely unable to anticipate it, such as when an enemy has a 1% crit chance rune. If I hit Tab and see the enemy has no critical strike items, then I pay close attention to the fight and time my skills and heals perfectly, managing to just barely edge him out of the fight, but then I die to a random 1% crit I wasn't expecting, how is that fair? And you could argue there's a very rare possibility of that happening, but it _does_ happen, and with very little given up on the part of the person who has the crit rune. That's because the % chance isn't the real issue, it's the burst granted by the % chance. It's all or nothing, and it's horrible.","replies":[{"poster":"Retillin","date":"2015-04-16T12:49:46.750+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":4,"body":"I'm sorry I'm stuck on your idea that Marksmen shouldn't be relevant in the mid game.

The number is larger, there's an awesome fiery icon next to the damage, the damage number moves differently, your champion does different things (animation and sometimes sound), and the enemy health bar takes a heavier chunk. Each of these aspects feed off of each other. There are an ensemble of elements executing this feeling and the shift itself between adagio to allegro is what matters. Having just one or the other can be quite boring for many.\n\nI give you that, the high damagenumbers + fancy animations really feel great.\nBut it isn't mpossible to get them without rng!\nThere are some ideas for crit reworks that keep big shiny numbers, they just would take a bigger scale of rebalanceing that flatening out the damage.\n\nbesides that, there are options for keeping those numbers with flattened crit:\nSheenprocs could trigger those animations and speciall damage numbers, high damage skills and even combos could reward with special damage numbers and a big chunk of missing health on the enemie healthbar(like a close distance buckshot, a pointblank cait Q, a turningpoint sivir Q...)\nIf you want to chunk for big loads with a single hit, than simply pick champions that offer that in their kit and itemize for abillity burst. If that isn't viable, that is a different problem.\nItems like the old SotD with on X attacks effeckts could proc crit-animations and offer burst spikes.\n\nReworking crit and still keeping a most of which made it fun definitly isn't easy and will be alot work, but it IS possible.

The output of each is the \"good\" aspect. The fight that it's RNG based isn't. It's just so happening that RNG is creating these outputs.\n\nThis distinction matters because a lot of the effects are harder to capture. I'll go into examples for each:\n\n>Why is it a good thing that you have the possibility to win fights that you should't win based on luck? Why is it good that a player that earned an advantage through skill can't press that advantage cause he's afraid of rng?\nAlso, why are adc and the trinity bruisers allowed to turn the tides of a fight by 'devine intervention' while APs and Tanks need to purly rely on skill for combacks, isn't that a bit double standarts here?\n\nThe main thing a range of projected threat (that includes greater than the average) does is deter snowballing and enables people towards wanting to play even when behind. Each player gets a very different sense of this point, and a lot of that choice tends to occur when people aren't aware of it. It's important to note that different people respond different here as well.\nOverall however, snowball effects tend to be a good thing. Until it reaches a certain point (extreme rubberbanding), then it becomes a bad thing.\n\nThe next issue is what is the value of this particular antisnowball effect? We're always trying to figure that out since it's a tricky point to reach. The more antisnowball effects, the more comebacks and the more long struggles. In the most extreme worlds, too little comeback potential (everything is equal) means that games are decided the moment one line goes slightly behind on CS. Too much means that games never end and you can never seal your advantage.\nThe question is, is how much is this mechanism specifically contributing (to either direction)? Also, how does it reflect **perception** of antisnowball on personal levels? Removing it _might_ increase the number of \"This game is over AFK\" first blood cases, for example.\n\n>Crit fishing is one of the mainreasons i hate current crit. It's not about proper use of skills and wavecontroll, it's about getting a random crit in the beginning of a trade and capitalizeing on it.\nI honestly fail to see any positiv aspects on that.if i see a caitline useing her passive on a minion and then missing her Q and therfor dash into her face as lucian, and i loose the trade cause she crits and i don't while we both have IE, i fail to see how that 'minigame' has anything to do with skill....\n\nThe example here you addressed something that is not critfishing. I may have not described it very well then. Sorry about that!\nI agree completely that in a committed skirmish that a rare and unexpected crit (e.g. the crit firing from a 1% Crit rune or a 10% from Zeal) is outside the realms of skill. That's exactly a primary problem of Critical chance (notably from low crit percentages!). That is also not Critfishing.\n\nCritfishing occurs when the champions are such that an autoattack initiates the skirmish. Champions that initiate via a moveblock or train play pattern tend to not experience this as much (or see it when it occurs on them), because the fight didn't start based on the Crit itself, it played out in spite of any Crits.\nInstead, Critfishing is where a champion will poke the enemy champion with intention to pull off immediately. Only upon seeing a crit does the aggressor engage. It's a chaotic fight initiator.\nIt's also important to note that during the course of that fight, they will have fewer possible Crits as well due to the nature of pseudoRNG. If properly responded to (avoiding their skills for example), a fish can turn negative.\n\nAgain however, this is a single examination of game mastery. The value of this occurrence is unknown.\n\n>Some how i fail to see the 'proper response window' to crits in teamfights.

I would like to follow up with a bit of a clarification (having now read through more of the responses).\n\nThese individual good things are within a sliding scale, and all of these are outputs of what Crit causes and not a commentary about the RNG itself or if Crit is holistically a good thing.\nMore directly: Don't take this as a reason why we should keep (or remove) Crit. It is simply an examination of the good qualities of Crit separated from the RNG nature of it.\n\nAs an example, threat range allows a team to not be completely snowballed. That it's RNG that leads to that threat range - or worse that it might of been RNG that started a snowball that needed to be deterred - is *not* a good thing.\n\n\nOr if a metaphor might make the stance more clear: When a person is impaled by an object, that's obviously bad. However, that object's existence could also be holding back internal bleeding so it should only be removed surgically and the good thing it's doing (stopping internal bleeding) should be respected and replaced by something else (preferably being closing the hole).\nThe object also caused the need to have the internal bleeding addressed, but that still doesn't mean that you can just rip the object out.\n\nCritical strike is that object.","replies":[{"poster":"Daen","date":"2015-04-22T17:49:08.700+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":">Or if a metaphor might make the stance more clear\n>The object also caused the need to have the internal bleeding addressed, but that still doesn't mean that you can just rip the object out.\n>Critical strike is that object.\n\nTo an extent, could it be argued that Flash is another one of these objects?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"asamu","date":"2015-04-17T05:49:12.776+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's funny that almost all of the positives and negatives are the same as Dodge had, but dodge was removed years ago.\n\nIf those are valid arguments for crit staying, then dodge should come back, but I think most people could agree that crit going away entirely would be much better for the game than bringing back dodge.\n\n\nOn another note: Balancing around lower damage and defense from items would lead to less polarized game play, which is one of the major problems in League imo. For high damage champions, getting a lead will often allow you to instantly kill anyone on the enemy team, but if you fall behind, you will often be one of the least impactful members of the team until VERY late in the game. It's not fun for a game to function in that way. For high defense champions, it's a similar state; when you are ahead, you can feel nigh on invincible, but while behind, it's frustrating how fast you die.\n\nLower damage and defense from items would also help mitigate lane snowballing, which IS a problem in league because of the length of the laning phase in standard games. In professional games, the laning phase might only last 5-10 minutes, but in casual games, the laning phase often lasts upwards of 15 minutes, and in many cases, champions that have high scaling and burst can get a single kill and snowball off of it to the point of their lane opponent being locked under the tower or roaming and losing all of the CS in that lane.\n\nIn short: Reduced item strength reduces the variance of gameplay, which, while it might make the case of winning less fun for the people that find it fun to stomp their opponents into the ground for 10 minutes, it makes the game better for the people that aren't winning.\n\n\n> Critical chance proposes a degree of possible threat that people do respond to. An ahead Marksman will be more reluctant to engage on a Marksman that's behind and has a bit of crit because of the chance of a crit still sits in the realms of possibility. This allows a behind Marksman to still project some control whereas if all damage was flattened this would be less true.\n\nBecause they have to, not because it's fun to do so. Streamlining damage output and putting more into the abilities for ADCs so that they don't rely so heavily on Auto attacks and/or giving controlled damage boosts from certain items that currently give crit would still allow for Marksman that are behind to turn things around.\n\nThis is literally the reason that was given when Dodge was removed from the game. It's NOT a positive.\n\n> There is an interaction with critical strike that I will call \"crit fishing\". Crit fishing is where someone will poke the enemy and then hard engage if they see a critical strike. If they don't, they back off (with the enemy sustaining back up a bit). Even though what's being tried is luck (ish, thanks to pseudo-rng it will actually be guaranteed eventually), there's a skill and a mini-game wrapped around it on capitalizing on the event. This entire mini game doesn't occur with a flattened damage situation.\n\nI do not find this fun playing from either side. It may be \"skillful,\" but it isn't fun. I would much rather be able to control an increase in damage to engage on (Think Bork+Ghostblade Twitch. Not crit-fishing; massive controlled upfront damage.)\n\nControlled crit would be fine (IE: activated ability on an item to increase damage for x seconds); it's the fact that it's completely random and can't be played around short of not fighting at all that's problematic.\n\n> One of the hardest ones to capture: the feeling of crit.\n\nIt's actually not that hard to capture the feeling of crits. Look at Blizzard's HoTS. They have multiple effects in that game that give temporary damage boosts and a \"Crit!\" indicator on the damage numbers. It gets the same feeling as critical strikes, but with no randomness.\n\nAlso, this may be \"fun\" on the end of the player that is getting crits, but it's the opposite for the player receiving them, which makes this point moot. Again, a controlled crit timing would allow for players to get that same feeling while the opposing player gets the chance to react and play around it. (See Searing attacks and similar effects in Heroes of the storm)\n\n> This flowing and shifting long fight dynamic would be lost with the flattened version.\n\nI think you are confusing ACTUALLY dynamic fights, where 1 person dies on a team, then the other team gets a pick and starts turning it around, for a fight randomly appearing dynamic, but in reality not being dynamic at all.\n\nA flattened damage output, would not make fights less dynamic, just less random.\n\nA controlled burst damage output would make fights actually be more dynamic. (Hence why I despise champions like Jinx and Garen who have consistent damage output and an execute (EVERY ability that functions as an execute has caused serious problems for balancing in this game... Go look back through the patch notes and champions that have caused trouble in balance since the game's release. EVERY champion with an execute has been buffed/nerfed/reworked multiple times and most of them eventually ended up either not viable or extremely overpowered for long periods of time, until eventually settling on being fringe playable and/or good for pubstomping). Executes aren't so much controlled burst as threshhold burst; Were they low enough? If so, they are dead, if not, then the person with the execute generally is.)\n\nCrit is good in single player games, but there have been 0 cases of multi-player PvP games where randomized Crit has been a beneficial mechanic.\n\n\nAt the very least, the variance in damage from critical strikes should be reduced. 200/250% damage on crits is too much. Something along the lines of 150/175% might be alright.\n\nThe problem is that crit is so powerful compared to every other stat in the game once your other stats are up to par, that it is mandatory to stack crit items on ADCs. Anything else is bad.\n\nRemoving crit might also allow for the removal of Deathcap, which would open up actual Hybrid builds as a possibility (they currently aren't viable because you lose out on the multiplicative scaling you can get focusing on one damage stat). Can we agree that this would be a good thing? More viable build variety = good.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Truly Prideful","date":"2015-04-16T13:12:43.680+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"I can understand most of your arguments for crit and I also dislike it a lot.

Thanks to pseudo-RNG, when there is a decent amount of crit (but not max) on a character in a full team fight where Marksman get to hang around for awhile then the fight will have a mix of crits and noncrits. In mid to late game, given the high damage outputs that Marksman have, this can be pretty defining. The marksman **will** crit someone into being into burst range, the question is \"who and can it be acted on?\" This is an element of unpredictability and interaction with other classes of characters (burst mages) that is very similar to point #1, but stretched even further and with a proper response window for teams to react and decide if and how they hold their engagement or disengage.

I'm all for variability keeping things interesting, but AAs by nature are supposed to be the most consistent aspect of the game (I click on you, you take X damage). \n\nIf you at Riot simply *removed* crit entirely as a purchasable stat (like the OP asked), then that would do a couple things from what I can see: ADCs would be substantially less powerful, but it would hurt ADCs without AD scalings the most (not good). It would also make the game experience kind of vanilla for them, but that could open up the opportunity for more unique items/more dynamic item interactions (maybe? It could also leave them with relatively bland builds). Lastly it would remove variability from their gameplay, which runs the risk of making it rather one dimensional. These aren't the best outcomes to be sure.\n\nIf you made it a flat % increase in damage like your example, statistically it would be the same as now and would not hurt those ADCs without substantial AD ratios. It would also make the game experience a bit more vanilla, and would again remove a lot of variability from their gameplay.\n\nThat said, ***is getting variability from RNG a healthy and truly interesting experience?***\n\nI would argue not. Statistically speaking it has the exact same effect as a simple % damage increase, but it is variable. That variability is only appealing in a select few scenarios and almost always is only satisfying *for the player who gets the crit.* \n\n1. For your first example, that is possibly the only positive I can see that is very consistent (ironically enough), because it helps the behind ADC, but again, that is only because *luck* poses a substantial risk to the player in the lead. It is good for the player who is behind, but the player in the lead feels somewhat cheated that they worked to get ahead, but the enemy ADC can just get lucky to nullify that lead, where it would feel better to have a slightly more skill reliant method of deterring snowballing.\n\n2. I have only seen this in a couple situations, so I'm not sure how pervasive this technique is, but again, this is variability that instead of adding depth to play pattern simply enforces a prerequisite to an engagement that once achieved has no difference on a fight, but gives the player who fished a strong advantage, which leaves the player on the receiving end feeling like the only way to avoid this \"crit fishing\" is to stay out of range. Since it is random though, you can't just play strategically and back away like when Caitlyn has headshot, you have to be wary and concerned about the risk at all times, which while adding some in game tension and sense of pressure, but also adds unnecessary stress for little gameplay enhancement.\n\n3. For this example, I think crit is just the supporting role and without it, the same situation would occur, just after more shots fired. Maybe a tank initiates, and the ADC gets several non crit AAs off onto a target. Just like when the ADC gets a lucky crit, you get the exact same moment of decision (which is linked to the assassin/burst mage, rather than the ADC).\n\n4. I would agree that getting a big meaty crit is really satisfying (like a Master Yi double strike-double crit, that feels glorious!), but again, it is equally *aggravating* to the player receiving the crit. Dealing crits is really fun, they give you a huge damage spike out of nowhere and can give an immense sense of power. Receiving cries feels like *absolute trash*. Suppose I'm playing as Sion. I catch out the enemy ADC and stun lock them. They are down to half health, but then they get a super lucky *crit-crit-crit* and suddenly I go from being the smart/skilled/strategic player that caught out the ADC to this sad sap at 20% HP because the ADC got *lucky*. That. Feels. GROSS.\n\nIn the end, I agree that replacing crit won't be simple in any way (you want to retain the *good feel* that it gives the user, while removing the *nasty feel* it gives the receiver), but the best way to tackle it is to get somebody working on a solution for it as soon as possible. There are a few things that really would do better as a simple % AA damage increase In the short term, things like Tryndamere's passive *shouldn't* be based around crit, but rather a % increase to give a clear window of strength, rather than a window of *maybe* strength.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ryvaku","date":"2015-04-15T22:39:40.839+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":2,"body":"Tryndmere would be a bit more useless.
