Just need to find a way to beat the 4 other gold+ opponents i am matched with then.","replies":[{"poster":"Unker139","date":"2019-09-09T23:50:00.597+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ll3lackbeard,realm=NA,application-id=RaE1aOE7,discussion-id=RnTjqUJb,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2019-09-09T23:35:45.502+0000)\n>\n> That would be awesome.

When I was iron, I gained more  lp from a 4th place finish than I lost from 8th.  \n\nFocus more on consistent play and less on wins.....and never give up even if things don't look like they are going well.  Holding on to get a 5th instead of a 7th is meaningful.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
