Now thinking back on {{champion:8}} Vladimir&#039;s biography, the beginning reminds me a bit of Jhin with the crazy bloodlust going on.  I am hoping he will have a bio update to really give a sense of his own character like how his little overview does. The diary makes the end a bit too open ended and weak.\r\n\r\n&gt; Left alone and suddenly without purpose, Vladimir resolved to return to Noxus, determined to prove the supremacy of his craft. \r\n\r\nAlright so our boy is going to flex his new hemomancy. \r\n\r\n&gt; When the Noxian High Command observed the gruesome fates which befell the palace guards, they elected to avail themselves of Vladimir&#039;s unsavory talents.\r\n\r\nSo they throw our unhinged and purposeless boy out of their huge Empire, built on the principles of strength (might, vision, guile), to the League. It sorta works since he doesn&#039;t have a vision aside from probably building his own prestige and standing in the aristocracy but it felt like a lazy ending. \r\n\r\nCut, paste and done. Good run everyone. {{sticker:zombie-brand-clap}}","replies":[{"poster":"Interlocutioner","date":"2018-04-16T16:24:23.144+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey DrockREQ, a few observations!\n\n[Avail](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/avail?s=t) actually means \"to take advantage of\"! Noxian High Command doesn't kick Vlad out of the empire, they decide to use his hemomantic talents to their advantage! {{sticker:vlad-salute}} \n\nBut, here's the real kicker. Noxian High Command? Not exactly canon anymore. We've put a lot of work into developing Noxus since Vlad's lore originally released, and haven't been able to officially revisit his place in the grand, cloak-and-dagger scheme of things. It's highly possible certain details will change in the near future. Noxus is more about the Trifarix nowadays.\n\nIt's a bit frustrating that we have this confusing mix of old and new lore on the \"official\" source of all lore for the game, Universe. Maybe it would be best to remove this bio until we're able to give Vlad something new and more accurate? \n\nThe good news is, we have an opportunity to ensure that in the future, his lore avoids lazy endings like the one you identified! Thanks for the thoughts.","replies":[{"poster":"Warlord Dienekes","date":"2018-04-17T00:59:37.443+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Wouldn’t it be easier to just make a banner that says OUTDATED on the top of old lore rather than removing it?\n\nThat way people who are interested in their champions have a way of finding some information about them.

Wasn't it also speculated that he was in Leagues with the Black Rose, since Swain, LeBlanc and himself represented an extraordinarily powerful trifecta of mages? Vladimir seems like one of the most powerful and connected characters of Noxus, with a lot of potential to explore Noxus' views on magic, aristocracy, and ambition within the empire through him. His Blood Mage archetype is way too cool to be merely glossed over and forgotten in the lore.","replies":[{"poster":"Interlocutioner","date":"2018-04-16T17:27:23.932+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes.
