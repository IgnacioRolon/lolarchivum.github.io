I would like to use it for attack move, but the game doesn't let me assign the left mouse button for anything at all. What instead happens is that the dialog just disappears when i press left mouse button. Is it possible to fix this? I'm guessing no, sadly, but it's worth asking, right? :/\n\nAlso, you know what would be useful? A command that upon pressing it's key, your champ will attack the target it has last attacked. This would be useful for kiting in a minion wave while focusing an enemy champion that chases you.","replies":[{"poster":"yoshi2790","date":"2016-09-21T19:42:24.946+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wanted to try it too, kinda lame it doesn't work but I understand it though.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-21T18:52:46.835+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That option isn't available in-game, and modifications to the game files in order to make it work often results in breaking your input settings.
