The way they push the game for burst damage is unfun for some people, but the amount of complaining is mind boggling. Any rework/mini-rework happens; “Riot destroyed my favourite champion, my life is ruined”, I understand, if my main was reworked I wouldn’t happy but play it out and wait like 2 weeks and then if you still think it’s shit then complain. It’s the same with any change people don’t like. I bet if Kled was nerfed next patch, the Kled Mains are gonna go; “Riot you gutted my champ, you’re so shit as game designers”\n\nIf you think the game is so unfun or unfair then don’t play it. If you don’t find enjoyment in a game don’t play it. Don’t go around saying “I wish league was like it was in season 4, Riot change your game”. \n\nObviously I don’t know everything but I kinda want to understand why League has such a whinny player base when you can leave anytime you want.","replies":[]}
