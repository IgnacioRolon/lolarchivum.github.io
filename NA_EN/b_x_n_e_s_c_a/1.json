I received no email about this so it came as a shock to me. I've submitted a ticket with support via my email but I can't update the details because it prompts me to log into the account that I can't even log into. I'm posting this from a smurf I had made a little over a month ago.\r\nI've been trying to research it on the internet and i've seen alarming posts about people who have been locked out for months. So i'm here to see if anyone else is dealing with this issue? I've spent A LOTTTTT of money on my account (which im not ashamed of, I love rito and the skins they come up with) but I'm extremely worried that im not going to get that content back.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-22T00:07:50.315+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Submitting a ticket was the right move in this situation since you'll need to work with one of our recovery specialists in order to sort this out.
