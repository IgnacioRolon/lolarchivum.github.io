This is a key reason why the system treats all disconnections equally and why penalties cannot be removed or modified. \n\nCrashes that happen during champ select are often caused by the client experiencing a drop in connection to the server due to an unstable connection.

Champ Select in all modes requires a more steady connection than the home page as picks (and bans for Draft) are processed in real-time. This is why it's more vulnerable to disconnect there. \n\nIt's not a widespread issue as only a few Summoners are experiencing this issue. \n\nI highly recommend you follow the steps in the guide Targons Blade linked you so we can put your disconnections to rest, prevent future punishments and level up your pre-gameplay experience. :)","replies":[{"poster":"Space Nërd ","date":"2016-08-08T21:09:13.759+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"inccorect. i have friends that i play with and we talk on curse and they all experience it, tons of people have it happen to them when im in a lobby, people even responded to my posts saying that it has happened to them aswell, and i am pissed because i dont lose internet connection as i am still talking to friends as my client crashes.","replies":[{"poster":"Kürama","date":"2016-08-08T21:38:17.780+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"While your network may not be at fault here, your connection with the LoL servers definitely is.
