While other roles have less Core Items to get and have often choices what to buy, Supports dont in case of the SIghtstone, which is maybe the most important Core Item for them.\n* **Sightstone favors Tank Supports.**\n   * While Health is useful in the one way or another for every Support, it is not so effective on Utility and Poke Supports than on Tank Supports.\n* **These Issues reduces the Support versatility**\n   * Especially for Supports, who are relieing on Items to be effective e.g. Poke Supports.\n\nThe Idea of having a choice among several Sightstones is not a new one. But with my Suggestion I want to fix more than just the Sightstone Problem. I also want to fix the Core-Items Problem.\nWith Sightstone giving Movementspeed, **Boots become actually an option for many Supports** &ndash; now you can more easily exchange Boots for another Item, which offers you MS, such as Twin Shadows or even an Item without..\nThe downside of this is, however, the **increase in price for the Sightstones**. Upgrading a Sightstone costs ~200 more than before, but are **much more worth the gold than before**.\nAlso **the last Upgrade refils itself** - like the Wardtrinkets, which fixes another issue a little: to teleport back to base just to refill your Sightstone.\n\nUpgradeable from a new Basic Item, the 3 new Supportstones represent **Defense, Aggression and Utility** and are so to say Counterparts to {{item:3303}} {{item:3301}} {{item:3302}}. You are free to Combine the Sightstone and the Supportitems.\n\n**Edit**: I decreased the flat Movementspeed but made it higher when out of Combat (like Mobility Boots). It also does not stack with Boots. On top of that you can add a boots enhancement to your Sightstone :)\nLeaves the Problem how to prevent laners to buy it.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**[New Item]: Tigereye**\nhttp://i62.tinypic.com/5v2no4.jpg\n_325 Gold + and one of the Following/their Upgrades: {{item:3303}} {{item:3301}} {{item:3302}} _\n> + **[Unique: Enhanced Movement]**: + 10 Movementspeed.

I'm not sure you realize how much income spellthief's generates...\n\nHere's some math:\n\nSpellthief's generates 2 gold per 10, or 12 gold per minute.

Combined with the passive 5 gold/hit every 10 seconds, that could max out at another 5gp/10, or 35 gpm- assuming you hit something Half this often, you end up with ~18 gold per minute, just from spellthief's (and that's only half efficiency from the onhit). At your first back @8, it's given you ~182 gold (Accounting for the 2 minutes you won't be hitting anything). If you do what I do (although I run relic's), you upgrade your gp item and get boots, and pick up a ward or two to keep the lane safe.\nSo now you have the same 2gp/10, only now you get 10 gold every time you hit a champion- every 10 seconds for 60 gpm, and assuming much error pulls down to 30+12gpm, 42 total. In the next 10 minutes, that's 420 gold- so it's not too efficient if you can't hit the enemy. But it spikes to 720 if you can actually hit the enemy like you should, making even just those 10 minutes wildly effective. From there, it just keeps giving back, especially if you pick up the final upgrade to let you kill minions and not have to deactivate the gp passive- lets you waveclear (or just pick up stray minions with AoE) while still getting your monies, along with an active slow and increased passive gp10.\nIt even synergizes with your masteries that give you gp for hitting the enemy for maximum annoyance for profit.\n\nAll in all, you really should get it to give yourself some decent income- you don't get minions, after all.

Combined with the passive 5 gold/hit every 10 seconds, that could max out at another 5gp/10, or 35 gpm- assuming you hit something Half this often, you end up with ~18 gold per minute, just from spellthief's (and that's only half efficiency from the onhit). At your first back @8, it's given you ~182 gold (Accounting for the 2 minutes you won't be hitting anything). If you do what I do (although I run relic's), you upgrade your gp item and get boots, and pick up a ward or two to keep the lane safe.\n> So now you have the same 2gp/10, only now you get 10 gold every time you hit a champion- every 10 seconds for 60 gpm, and assuming much error pulls down to 30+12gpm, 42 total. In the next 10 minutes, that's 420 gold- so it's not too efficient if you can't hit the enemy. But it spikes to 720 if you can actually hit the enemy like you should, making even just those 10 minutes wildly effective. From there, it just keeps giving back, especially if you pick up the final upgrade to let you kill minions and not have to deactivate the gp passive- lets you waveclear (or just pick up stray minions with AoE) while still getting your monies, along with an active slow and increased passive gp10.\n> It even synergizes with your masteries that give you gp for hitting the enemy for maximum annoyance for profit.\n> \n> All in all, you really should get it to give yourself some decent income- you don't get minions, after all. It's worth delaying your core by a little bit to get.\n\nThe problem isn't the potential payout.  It's the amount of time it takes to acquire it.  For the little amount of gold I accrue early-game, I could dump it all in the support item for later pay-out, or I could get a Tear and be set on mana, which gives me much more map presence and laning threat than the support item.  Or I could get boots+a component of sightstone, or a sightstone itself, etc.\n\nIt pays off eventually, but by that time, you could have already had more important early-game items. \n\nGranted, it depends on the support you're playing.  I play Zilean so the build is kind of nuanced.  In particular, I need the Tear ASAP.\nFor supports like Soraka, your baseline effectiveness is probably enough to just go Spellthief's.\n\nEither way, I think the fact that tank supports have been overwhelmingly dominant for a long time suggests that squishy supports are, in general, a little bit undertuned.  Or maybe they just have worse itemization, or too-heavy mana costs.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Mad Milliner","date":"2015-08-25T03:09:19.344+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a pretty great idea.

It assumes supports should be required to buy sightstone.\n\nThe issue isn't with supports and sightstone's strength.  It's that too many people don't understand the true power of warding.\n\nI always buy sighstone on my supports.  Personal preference.  I can think of more than a few supports that can ward effectively  without them too though.\n\nIn any event, vision control is a team activity.  The ap mid or adc that only places 2 wards in a match is failing their team and the game in general.  Sighstone doesn't need a buff.  It's incredibly powerful as is.  What the games really needs is a tutorial that teaches players how valuable sightstone, trinkets and vision control in general are.\n\nVision control may not win a game, but lack of it will certainly  lose a game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JustBoneBrook","date":"2015-08-25T19:41:25.799+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Only Support item i find good is {{item:3361}} and {{item:3302}}  (not {{item:3401}}  or {{item:3097}})","replies":[]}]}
