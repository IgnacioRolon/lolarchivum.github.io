Paid for $25. Well, when I got back to my friends house, I scratched off the code area and, in the process, damaged at least half of the code. I did make a few attempts at TRYING to read and input the damaged code but none were successful and I was hit with the 24-hour lockout.  I sent a support ticket within a few hours with a more detailed explanation and including several photos of my damaged card and the receipt. I was wondering if anyone else had ever run into the same problem and what their outcome was. Also, if any Reds are out there and see this, if they could give some input. Thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-10T21:49:50.669+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not on our billing team, so I can't really speculate on what may happen as a result of your support ticket.

I actually sent a second ticket because I kinda messed up with the categorizing of my issue with the first one and I thought that might have an effect on getting my ticket addressed. First one was categorized under  Management or something and my second one I put it under RP Purchasing Errors. I'll leave it at that though, I won't be flooding you guys with multiple tickets on the same issue and I'll be waiting patiently. Thanks for your reply Targons Blade.","replies":[]}]}]}
