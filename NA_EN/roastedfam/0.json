It doesnt give me a time-out message just a small message about how there was an error. Also sometimes i disconnect from league halfway though a match even though my internet connection is totally fine. Maybe this is unrelated or maybe not. Is anyone else experiencing these problems?","replies":[{"poster":"CrazFight ","date":"2016-07-27T00:12:07.451+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ye... \nI suggest downloading the[ WinMTR Network Diagnostic Tool](http://winmtr.net/download-winmtr/), then use that to run a traceroute to the following IP (allow this to run for 5-15 minutes);\n\n104.160.131.1\n\nExport the results to a text file and paste them here if you'd like us to help, or submit them in a [Support Ticket.](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new)\n\nThis will help us determine if there is actually \"nothing\" wrong with your internet ^_^","replies":[{"poster":"RoastedFam","date":"2016-07-28T01:55:13.126+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"WinMTR statistics                                   \nHost              -   %  | Sent | Recv | Best | Avrg | Wrst | Last |\n192.168.1.1 -    0 |  454 |  454 |    0 |    2 |  393 |    1 |\n10.207.46.1 -    0 |  454 |  454 |    6 |   10 |  353 |   11 |\nNo response from host -  100 |   90 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |\n198.251.50.209 -    1 |  450 |  449 |   20 |   25 |  356 |   62 |\n198.251.50.249 -    0 |  454 |  454 |   21 |   24 |  355 |   24 |\n198.251.50.233 -    0 |  454 |  454 |   20 |   24 |  358 |   25 |\nte0-0-0-2.211.rcr11.b011027-3.yyz02.atlas.cogentco.com -    1 |  450 |  449 |   21 |   26 |  359 |   62 |\nte0-0-0-30.ccr21.yyz02.atlas.cogentco.com -    1 |  450 |  449 |   21 |   26 |  357 |   71 |\nlevel3.yyz02.atlas.cogentco.com -    0 |  454 |  454 |   21 |   26 |  355 |   25 |\nNo response from host -  100 |   90 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |\n4.35.80.238 -    0 |  454 |  454 |   34 |   41 |  367 |   41 |\n104.160.132.35 -    1 |  450 |  449 |   37 |   42 |  366 |   75 |\nae31-br01.chi01.riotdirect.net -    0 |  454 |  454 |   41 |   49 | 1043 |   46 |\n104.160.131.1 -    1 |  450 |  449 |   41 |   47 |  139 |   77 |","replies":[{"poster":"CrazFight ","date":"2016-07-28T02:34:39.296+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Bot Darius,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=VJ5E5aKa,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2016-07-28T01:55:13.126+0000)\n>\n> WinMTR statistics                                   \n> Host              -   %  | Sent | Recv | Best | Avrg | Wrst | Last |\n> 192.168.1.1 -    0 |  454 |  454 |    0 |    2 |  393 |    1 |\n> 10.207.46.1 -    0 |  454 |  454 |    6 |   10 |  353 |   11 |\n> No response from host -  100 |   90 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |\n> 198.251.50.209 -    1 |  450 |  449 |   20 |   25 |  356 |   62 |\n> 198.251.50.249 -    0 |  454 |  454 |   21 |   24 |  355 |   24 |\n> 198.251.50.233 -    0 |  454 |  454 |   20 |   24 |  358 |   25 |\n> te0-0-0-2.211.rcr11.b011027-3.yyz02.atlas.cogentco.com -    1 |  450 |  449 |   21 |   26 |  359 |   62 |\n> te0-0-0-30.ccr21.yyz02.atlas.cogentco.com -    1 |  450 |  449 |   21 |   26 |  357 |   71 |\n> level3.yyz02.atlas.cogentco.com -    0 |  454 |  454 |   21 |   26 |  355 |   25 |\n> No response from host -  100 |   90 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |\n> 4.35.80.238 -    0 |  454 |  454 |   34 |   41 |  367 |   41 |\n> 104.160.132.35 -    1 |  450 |  449 |   37 |   42 |  366 |   75 |\n> ae31-br01.chi01.riotdirect.net -    0 |  454 |  454 |   41 |   49 | 1043 |   46 |\n> 104.160.131.1 -    1 |  450 |  449 |   41 |   47 |  139 |   77 |\n\nIt seems you get many spikes which could be the cause of a unstable connection to riot servers , I recommend using the Connection TroubleShooting guide as mentioned above.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-07-27T16:39:05.334+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You could be experiencing an unstable connection to the servers.
