While she does have some helpful effects to boost her team's potential, primarily a poke support's job is to constantly keep pressure, zoning the enemy adc out with the threat of either high damage or hard cc. While you can build like an enchanter on Lux and be good, without damage you still fall behind. Typically I go {{item:2301}} {{item:3020}} {{item:3174}} {{item:3504}} {{item:3027}} {{item:3089}} . \n\nEye is obvious, so are boots. Athene's is critical on Lux, Ardent is mostly for the ap and the % boost to heals and shields (but the passive is good too, even gutted after the next patch). Rod gives mana, which Lux needs lots of, and health to prevent you from being curb stomped. Sustain in lane, and ap, a very good item. And Raba to finish it out since total this would give you about 430-450 ap (depending on your runes/masteries bonuses). It's supporty, but can still do damage, without being enchanter-built, or mid-lane build.","replies":[]},{"poster":"iLBGAMing","date":"2017-10-20T10:38:12.604+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or even better people call out in champion select screen \"support\" when they only build one support item {{item:2301}} and then just build full AP.
