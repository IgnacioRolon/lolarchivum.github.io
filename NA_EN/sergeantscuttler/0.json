They all influence the gameplay, they all give bonuses and change the information about player's setup. But suddenly you try to suggest that \"that particular group has indicators\" (no, they don't)?\nI said a lot of the minor runed don't have any indicators for the enemy, you tried to suggest they do and asked \"where I got that idea from\". Don't try to move the goal posts now, buddy.\n\nExactly, you can see biscuits in their inventory after they get it/use it.
