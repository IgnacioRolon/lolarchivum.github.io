In their current form, runes will probably always be something you just look up on the internet and copy from a guide, and that&rsquo;s not awesome. \n\nThis argument could apply to anything which has the capacity to be studied and thus seems silly. Keystones don&#039;t offer more customization than before. You actually have fewer choices but they make a larger game impact. In most cases, there is one Keystone which works best for a certain champion. You&#039;re not about to see DFT, Fervor or SoA on LB.\n\nRunes are one of the remaining areas where you actually have meaningful choices. While many runes aren&#039;t really viable (something Riot can improve without abandoning the system), there is still plenty to change based on matchup, playstyle, and powerspikes. Even if you were to study the game like a professional, differences in composition and matchups still make it unrealistic for a one-size-fits-all page to be best.  I&#039;ll take Ziggs for example since he&#039;s one of my favorite champions:\n\nVs difficult matchups with high burst like LB:\nI might want to take flat MR Glyphs and even Quints if I&#039;m really scared and they have an AP JG too like Nidalee.\n\nVs poke AP champions like Xerath & Fiddlesticks or Amumu JG:\nI&#039;ll probably want scaling MR since their kill pressure is mostly level 6+.\n\nVs poke & burst champions like Lux or Vel&#039;Koz:\nIdeally, I&#039;d want MS Q and scaling MR or scaling CDR. With a few levels and items, one bind or Vel&#039;Koz E can often mean death. High MS is critical. \n\nVs AD champions like Zed:\nI&#039;ll take scaling CDR most times so that I can use my escape more and outscale. If they&#039;re weak early like Talon, I might go for AP or Scaling AP Glyphs.\n\nWhen we both lack kill pressure:\nIf I&#039;m facing something like Taliyah or Morgana, I&#039;ve found little success going for kills so I sometimes take 30% scaling CDR playing for a more late game oriented build.\n\nThese are only modest examples of customization and there&#039;s way more you can do. A Nocturne going Fervor may want ArPen marks while he&#039;d take AD marks when going Thunderlords. There&#039;s a lot of interplay between runes and masteries. \n\nThe rune system isn&#039;t broken and offers more viable options than anything else in the game if you care to explore them. **The main issue is that some runes are simply not up to par in strength. **\n\nI sometimes feel that Riot has too many people working to reinvent the wheel. In fact, a lot of players like the core gameplay as it is and the changes often offer more frustration than benefit. I understand the need for rebalancing but sometimes it goes too far. What if we changed the rules of tennis every year? A lot of people who actually like tennis may not like the new format and it would also create enormous difficulties for tournaments, players, trainers, and the audience as a whole. I actually bought some tennis training DVDs a few years ago and if that was League instead, the game would be so different that they&#039;d be useless for me now. Unlike other sports, because League changes so fast, it&#039;s also less interesting to look at famous old matches. That gameplay has little to do with how it is now.\n\nThe example that pains me the most is the random Kog rework when he wasn&#039;t oppressive in either solo or competitive play. I instantly had my favorite mid laner and playstyle for 6 straight seasons deleted. 1/3 of Kog players used him as an AP poke mid and nothing else has ever quite fit his old niche. Instead of a versatile champion which supported a wide variety of builds and playstyles, I got a mindless W bot. He&#039;s not even a midlane hypercarry anymore. I fear the same thing for runes. Instead of dozens of customizations, I bet it will become a simplified system with fewer options. Will I even still be able to sacrifice laning strength and take 30% scaling CDR?","replies":[{"poster":"Great Muta","date":"2016-09-02T14:37:37.710+0000","up_votes":35,"down_votes":0,"body":"Runes aren't bad, just they are too expensive IP wise, the pages have to be bought to make it worthwhile and new players are at a huge disadvantage.

The quoted statement is a bit contradictory and indeed, even at the pro level, there is more variation in runes than masteries. For example, some ADCs take AS glyphs while others go flat MR and some even go scaling MR vs passive lanes.

Yeah I guess there's no point in having 9 rune pages if you can just edit 1 really fast every game. But I think everyone, including Riot, would be okay with trading the IP/RP cost of rune pages for a better, easier-to-use rune system. Especially because paying for rune pages is basically paying for power in-game, if it means you have a better loadout available more often.","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2016-09-02T21:44:29.144+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think they should just reduce the cost of runes or make them free like masteries.\n\nI would like to be able to edit runes in champion select, but I doubt they'll add that for a while to come regardless.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"BlâckLotus","date":"2016-09-02T20:54:35.036+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"riot i know you want to make runes intresting but please dont do what you did with the masteries,i do enjoy having an impactfull to the game mastery but i also want to have CHOICES.","replies":[]},{"poster":"48983507DEL1","date":"2016-09-02T17:52:12.626+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lets be real.
