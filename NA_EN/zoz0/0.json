Said \"Sup boys.\" Ready to play a fun game. Asked how come I never see Taric players anymore. Then out of freaking nowhere, the WW and Diana begin to tell me inhumane things about my (deceased) mother. They called her a whore and 10x worse as champ select progressed. I told them that was the last time I would talk and they continued to bash me. The replay has all the proof. They flamed the hell out of me. I muted them in game yet my TEAM was laughing and saying stuff like \"Yeah WW thats funny.\" And told me, \"It's just words dude.\" \n\nIt's actually not just words when I have a breakdown and cry during a game cause my mom passed away a few months ago. This was seriously the worst representation of humanity I ever, ever, ever experienced. **I'm seriously asking here if I can get a personal email about what is going to happen to these two players**. I've never been more passionate about a report in my life. I had an anxiety attack because of these really mean human beings. \n\nAcid Butterfly was the Diana\nPetimus Crediumus was the WW.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/iB5gfNd\n\nThat's what he said at the end. I muted them so I don't even want to imagine what they said then.\n\nPlease Riot, you can't let toxic people like this just get away with it. Can you please contact me personally about this. \nluffyandzoe@gmail.com","replies":[{"poster":"Ganked By Tilt","date":"2017-06-19T20:39:29.745+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looks like they were duo :/, toxic duo.

If you feel like reporting just isn't enough, take those screenshots and any others you might have and shoot those over to our player behavior team in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). I'm sure they will be more than happy to investigate.","replies":[]}]}
