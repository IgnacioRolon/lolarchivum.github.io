Now when I try to patch it, I am running it as administrator because I have heard that it helps. It scans my files then begins patching appropriately. However, the download progressively slows down. I start around 7000 KB/s, a usual speed for me then it slowly decreases down to like 300 KB/S. I checked my download rates for Overwatch, and I was downloading at 7.2 MB/s, usual for me. Also, it always show that I have 3351.0 MB left to download for LoL, no matter how long I let it sit there (as the download speed decreases). How do I fix this?","replies":[{"poster":"illsuckyourtoes","date":"2017-12-30T07:43:37.346+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same issue, obviously nothing has been fixed. Cant find a way around this anywhere online. As a gamer coming back to league solely to keep in touch with one or two close friends I am very disappointed, as what has been a night I was looking forward to has been ruined.","replies":[]},{"poster":"sk√ºks","date":"2017-05-19T00:57:22.327+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same issue here","replies":[]},{"poster":"KENNY CHESNEY420","date":"2017-05-18T06:08:19.419+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Any update to a fix for this? I am having the -exact- same issue. Connection is fine, I'm actively running a Speedtest as this is patching.

I recommend going through the steps in the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to troubleshoot any obstacles and strengthen up your connection.  Just don't cancel out your update, and let it do its thing.  Otherwise, you'll force the patcher to scan all your game files for  corruption before starting the update all over again.  Let me know if that clears things up!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fatboy415","date":"2017-05-17T23:30:25.100+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same issue, currently downloading new patch @ 176 kbps.
