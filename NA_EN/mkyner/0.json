With his permission, I&#039;ve been developing a satellite-style version of this map, like you might find on Google Earth. To do this, I need to determine what the physical geography of this Runeterra is like. This post is the first part of that process, which looks at ocean currents and weather. \r\n\r\n(Note, I made some edits to Killaburn&#039;s original map so it would be easier for me to work with, and some changes that I thought made more sense geographically. Hope that&#039;s ok! Also note, all this is assuming Runeterra has similar shape, size, and rotation properties as Earth.)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nBefore I can do any climate work, I needed to figure out how big of an area I&#039;m working with. Different climate characteristics are generally associated with certain latitudes. To determine the latitudes, I overlaid an outline of the Runeterra map onto a map of Earth, then adjusted the size until it lined up correctly. This was the result...\r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/aAd4GfA.jpg\r\n\r\n(Unconfirmed locations end with &quot;?&quot; and are based on Killaburn&#039;s logical conjectures. Other locations are based on Medarda map. Also, note the distinction between Shurima Continent and Shurima the political faction/region)\r\n\r\nWhy this size? From the Medarda Heirloom, we have a good idea of the locations for Piltover, Noxus, Shurima, Bilgewater and Ionia. From the sailing times given on the Heirloom, I decided that the length of the sea depicted there was about the size of Earth&#039;s Mediterranean Sea. So, it was just a matter of lining up that portion of the Middle Sea from Killaburn&#039;s map (about the eastern-most quarter) to our Mediterranean, and then aligning several Runeterra regions with the latitudes appropriate for the climates we know exist there. For example, Shurima _needed_ to be on the same latitude as the Sahara desert, (around 20 degrees North), and Kumungu _needed_ to be at a latitude near the equator to support tropical jungles. Freljord of course had to be in the north, and Noxus needed to be in a more temperate climate (if Noxus was atop a mountain or in its own desert, I think we would have heard something about it, so temperate climate seemed a logical choice). The end result places most of the Valoran and Ionian continents at the same latitude as Europe, Russia and Canada, while Shurima is at the same latitude as northern Africa and the southern US. From the base map of Earth, I assigned latitude lines to Killaburn&#039;s map. Freljord is a bit further north than I&#039;d like, but everything else landed in a reasonable climate. \r\n\r\nCartographer&#039;s note, I&#039;m using a mercator projection here. This means that areas near the poles are depicted as bigger than they really are. (If you want to see this for Earth, zoom out on Google Maps and compare Greenland to Africa; though Greenland looks bigger, it&#039;s only about 1/14th the size of Africa.) As a result, Freljord and the northern part of Ionia are not as big as they seem. I chose mercator because it&#039;s easier to work with for what I&#039;m doing, and because it was easier to line up regions with their climates; several diverse areas are relatively close (Shurima, Piltover and Noxus), while Freljord is pretty far north. With mercator, I can wave off some of that distance as simple map distortion. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nWith latitude lines in place, it&#039;s time to determine our ocean currents. We need this to determine weather patterns and likely climate zones. On Earth, ocean currents move in giant circles called gyres. The Gulf Stream carries warm water north along the eastern US coast while the Canary Current returns cooler water down the coast of Morocco. Using Earth ocean currents as a base, I decided these are the likely currents on this part of Runeterra...\r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/HFEi6mL.png\r\n\r\nRed are warm water currents, blue are cold water, and purple are not extreme cold or warm. Warm currents are generally associated with moisture while cool currents with dryness. The warm current that circles up from near the Shadow Isles and passes between Bilgewater and the Shurima Continent is similar to Earth&#039;s Gulf Stream. This current will provide warm water for hurricanes to strike eastern Shurima Continent and Bilgewater, and help steer warmth and moisture to the southwestern shore of Ionia. On Earth, the Atacama and Kalahari deserts are both along shorelines with cold currents. In this version of Runeterra, we see cold currents along the northeast shores of Ionia and Valoran and the southwest shore of Shurima. The area around Targon would probably be pretty dry.\r\n\r\nThe Middle Sea between Valoran and Shurima Continent is somewhat problematic. The closest parallel we have on Earth is the Mediterranean Sea. While the Mediterranean does have its own currents, they don&#039;t play a role in larger ocean circulation. Because of the hot, dry areas around the Mediterranean, ocean water flows into the Mediterranean at Gibraltar to replace evaporated water in the eastern end of the sea. The Middle Sea here is different for two main reasons. One, it&#039;s much larger than the Mediterranean and has fewer obstructions (like the Italian peninsula). Two, it has openings at both ends. The Middle Sea would see extreme evaporation along the Shurima Continent shoreline, just as the Mediterranean does along Africa. But on the other hand, the northwest portion of the Middle Sea is in a temperate zone and would have more rainfall than any part of the Mediterranean. In addition, the Middle Sea would be the destination for rivers from both continents. So, we have water leaving via evaporation, and water coming via rain and runoff. Ultimately, I don&#039;t think the Middle Sea would have currents that strongly impact weather the way the bigger ocean currents do. But, this sea could serve as a source of moisture for storms to bring rain further east on the Valoran continent than they normally would (like lake affect snow, but for rain, and on a bigger scale). \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAnd this brings us to.... THE WEATHER. On Earth, prevailing winds generally blow from east to west between the equator and 30 degrees North. This is why hurricanes move from the central Atlantic towards the Caribbean and North America. From 30 degrees to 60 degrees, winds generally blow from west to east. This is how a lot of North America gets its weather. Storms come down from Canada or the Pacific Northwest, sweep over the Midwest and exit over New England or the Maritime provinces. So, if we take what we know of prevailing winds, and how currents impact local climates, we can get a sense of what most ground covering on Runeterra would be like...\r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/sEoeu7N.png\r\n\r\n(Quick note: this assessment does not take into account mountains and the impact they can have on local climates; that will be addressed in Part 2.)\r\n\r\nPink lines are the main prevailing winds. \r\n\r\nThe first thing we notice is how wet the eastern end of the Shurima Continent is. This makes sense for the lower area with Kumungu Jungle (comparable to northeastern South America, on the edge of the Amazon). But the northeast corner of Shurima Continent is problematic. This area should be like the Caribbean or southeastern US (Florida especially), given its proximity to the ocean. Not really what you think of when it comes to Shurima. For comparison, look at the Sahara and then east along the Tropic of Cancer. Most of that latitude passes over land until you reach Southeast Asia, where storms from the Pacific dump a lot of rain. At that latitude, the eastern end of a big land mass should be wet and the west end should be dry. \r\n\r\nBut, there could be an explanation. The Medarda Heirloom depicts a large river system draining that exact area; the rain has to come from somewhere. It should probably be reaching further west into Shurima, but there could be an undepicted mountain range, or magical effects from the Rune Wars, keeping the moisture out. The border between wet Kumungu and dry Shurima would be grassland, similar to the Sahal south of the Sahara. \r\n\r\nThanks to prevailing winds and the cold current off of Targon, much of Shurima is dry. I&#039;m not sure how far along the southern coast the jungles would extend before being replaced by grassland (comparable to the llanos tropical grassland in Venezuela and Colombia). Depending on the season and specific storm trajectory, moisture could come from the nearby coastline to extend the jungle for some distance to the west, though the grassland would not be far inland beyond that. \r\n\r\nThe northwest of Shurima Continent would be like a different world. This area extends up through the temperate zone. This is comparable to the west coast of North America. Killaburn placed Bandle City pretty far north (roughly Juneau, Alaska), but with the warm current, it wouldn&#039;t be too bad. The very northern tip would extend to taiga/boreal forests. If there are mountains, expect glaciers that drop icebergs into the Middle Sea.\r\n\r\nThe Valoran Continent is a lot like Canada and the Great Lakes/Northeastern US, though possibly wetter. In the northern hemisphere, climate bands generally go from northwest to southeast. The clearest example of this is in Canada where the border between the prairie and boreal forests and then tundra run in a line from upper Alberta and Northwest Territory down towards the Great Lakes and Hudson Bay, respectively. The northern portion of Valoran would be tundra with forest further south. In this map, Freljord ended up way way way north, about on the level of Greenland. Similarly, it should be in an icecap. I envision Freljord as more like Scandinavia though, so will probably move it a bit further south before moving forward with the project.\r\n\r\nThe southern part of Valoran would be more hospitable. This area would probably be wetter than the Canadian Prairie or the Great Plains in the US, thanks to the Middle Sea. While the Middle Sea isn&#039;t large enough to establish regional climate changes the way the ocean currents do, it would still serve as a source of moisture for passing storms. Winters along the southern shore could be very snowy as a result. Summer would be mild. There would probably be more forest than grasslands along the shore. \r\n\r\nAny large prairie in Valoran would have to be on the plain between Noxus and Piltover. This is the only place that could be dry enough and warm enough for such grasslands. This area is also the most likely to form tornadoes, given the warm, moist air coming up from the Middle Sea and the ocean off Bilgewater. Eastern Valoran shore would be similar to the northeast US, but more mild during winter.\r\n\r\nThe northern half of Ionia would be forest or tundra. Great place for new things to appear. The southern half would be temperate. Southwest Ionia would see significant rain, comparable to England. That large bay would be especially comfortable, and likely to form the core of a local trade network. \r\n\r\nThe Shadow Isles should have a climate similar to Cuba. Bilgewater is in the perfect place to be regularly lashed by storms. During the winter, storms coming off Valoran to the west would strike the islands. During the summer, tropical storms would batter the islands from the south and southeast. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe main thing missing here are mountains. A few mountain ranges can change things significantly. Much of eastern Washington state is dry thanks to Seattle and the Cascades catching the moisture from incoming Pacific storms. Here, a mountain range south of Piltover could extend Shurima&#039;s dryness further east. A coastal mountain range along the southern edge of the Shurima Continent could limit how far the Kumungu Jungle spreads. Mountains in the middle of south-central Valoran would lead to a dryer Noxus and more grassland further east. Similarly, mountains in southwestern Ionia would result in a dryer interior to that continent. These are the things I hope to explore in the next part of this project.","replies":[{"poster":"An Undead brat","date":"2017-08-24T12:24:23.366+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"Waiting for Riot Bioluminescence like:\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-popcorn}}","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2017-08-24T16:52:46.171+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Sexy Bisex Plant,realm=EUNE,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=4EF57KGs,comment-id=0006,timestamp=2017-08-24T12:24:23.366+0000)\n>\n> Waiting for Riot Bioluminiscence like:\n> {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-popcorn}}\n\nHey!

This is just beautiful.\n\nMkyner, I am super impressed by what you've done here - we went through a very similar process on our end too - ocean currents, trade winds, relative planetary scale, that sort of thing.

I love seeing that huge ocean current being dragged round the equator by the Earth's spin, and then get peturbed by the mighty Amazon river!  I love turning on the SO2 display and finding little active volcanoes in the middle of nowhere.  I've been getting a lot of inspiration there, and just kind of absorbing a deeper understanding of interacting systems etc.  Even when it's not directly relevant to my work, it's just awesome to study.","replies":[{"poster":"I Main Swain","date":"2017-08-24T17:18:31.543+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"it looks like the whole of known runeterra only covers a very small portion of the globe, what do you think the possibility is of an eventual \"discovery\" of a new continent?","replies":[{"poster":"mkyner","date":"2017-08-24T22:03:34.572+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"That would be a great way for Riot to introduce 15 or 20 new Champions at once.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The DrBonjigollo","date":"2017-08-25T03:40:22.443+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This would be super exciting but hasn't riot ventured every theme possible with the current factions?\n\n* The Shadow Isles: The undead.\n* Ionia: Furries, Ninjas, Monks and 'mystical/strange' magic\n* Bandle City: Gnome-furries\n* Zaun: Steampunk Science\n* Piltover: Cyberpunk? / General Science\n* Demacia: Knights and Royalty, generally the good guys\n* Noxus: Brutal Strength and Badass-ery, the bad guys\n* The Void: Aliens and monsters\n* The Freljord: Snow People and Demigods\n* Mount Targon: Warriors and Demigods\n* Bilgewater: Pirates, Bounty hunters, Biker Gangs, and Religion(s?) \n* Shurima: Desert Dwellers and Demigods\nBeyond those, the outliers go with space ({{champion:136}}{{champion:432}}{{champion:16}} ) and common things to humans ({{champion:203}} Death, {{champion:10}} {{champion:25}} Angels {{champion:12}} Minotaurs {{champion:9}} Scarecrows, etc) and then there's {{champion:72}}.\n\n What I can think of that hasn't been put out is Swamp People, Voodoo, A full continent of Dragons, Competent Aliens(like riot's blue bobble-head that was never released), and maybe even bring back the HearthBlood from Ornn's lore.","replies":[{"poster":"I Main Swain","date":"2017-08-25T05:29:52.011+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"idk why that made me think this but is there a bounty hunter yet?  also ethereals and other forms of mystic beings could be a possibility off the top of my head","replies":[{"poster":"The DrBonjigollo","date":"2017-08-25T07:16:14.840+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, there is! {{champion:21}}{{champion:107}} and {{champion:203}}\nProblem is they all revolve less around hunt a bounty and more around kill everybody to git gud.

The only cyberpunk we really have is the futuristic setting for the PROJECT skin line. \n\nAssuming the other half of Runeterra isn't overrun by the Void, I think that new continents beyond what we have would probably be repetitions of current themes. I mean, Earth has had multiple cultures in similar climate regions on different sides of the world. We had big empires in Rome and China at the same time. Inuit versus Norse for the 'cold' theme, for another example. Freljord seems to focus more on battle and what we think of as Vikings. A new 'cold' faction could be more religious/spiritual or magic based. Not sure how that would translate into unique champion abilities though. But the faction could at least be made unique.\n\nMaybe one of the other continents is home to an immortal race where Kayle and Morgana come from (like the Elf lands west of Middle Earth).\n\nI think some of these 'off the map' regions might come in to play if Riot ever decided they needed an 'other' group for a known champion or faction to interact with, or needed a setting for something new (new game style or story?) that was set in Runeterra but needed to be far from the traditional factions.

So there's definitely more to the south. While you're right that we don't know for sure, I am assuming Runeterra is an earth-sized planet so it is easier for me to apply earth climate dynamics.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nylisa","date":"2017-08-25T07:56:50.850+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is Beautiful , i thought im the only one who spend time analyzing a fictional world to make a better concept of it for myself.\n\nas someone who use to study social sciences, i also spend a good deal of time trying to understand many different disciplines of a beloved fictional universe such as its anthropology,history,economics,political science, psychology, religion,philosophy, sociology and archaeology!\n\neach one of these fields can be extremely hard to determine without proper data and each piece of information released by Riot helps a lot but still i have lots of questions before i can write a proper article like this.\n\ni will add this to my database, thank you and very well done :)","replies":[{"poster":"mkyner","date":"2017-08-25T14:57:40.433+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Glad you like it!\n\nMy focus in school was more towards urban geography and GIS, and I have a strong interest in history.

The northern winds go from east to west, and the southern winds go from west to east?\n\nThis would better explain Shurima, and the wind would pull moisture off the middle sea, delivering it to Piltover and Noxus, and having Shurima act like the Sahara, developing storms that would hit Ionia.\n\nHowever, this causes a problem for the Kumungu jungle, for it would be far too dry to host a tropical jungle. Perhaps, there is an even more southernly wind that blows in the same direction as the northern most wind does, delivering moisture from the southern most ocean.","replies":[{"poster":"mkyner","date":"2017-08-24T21:57:56.522+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wind and current patterns are derived from the direction in which the planet rotates (see Coriolis Effect; this describes how fluids move on a rotating sphere), so flipping the prevailing winds would imply flipping the currents, and also imply that the sun would rise in the west.

That kind of ties our hands.\n\nBut putting that aside... Simply flipping the map so north becomes south wouldn't work, since the east-to-west trade winds between 0 and 30 degrees applies to both hemispheres (for illustration, compare western Pacific Ocean typhoon paths in the northern summer with cyclone paths in the southern summer; they both move west, they just arc in different directions). \n\nBut, rotating the map so North becomes South AND East becomes west would solve the issue! South America is a perfect example of this. Shurima ends up aligned with the Atacama Desert. You can see on satellite images the contrast between the dry Atacama on the west coast and the greener lands in Argentina on the east coast at the same latitude. Between 30 and 35 degrees, this flips. Chile, along the west coast, is green and wet, while to the east, Argentine Patagonia is dry. This would place Piltover around the latitude of Buenos Aires, Noxus around the temperate part of Chile, and allow for some big dry steppe to exist beyond Noxus (east of Noxus in this new arrangement). \n\nNow, this would leave Bilgewater kind of dry, and depending on how big Ionia is, the shore facing Valoran could be dry, too. But it would definitely solve the hurricanes-in-shurima issue. \n\nGood thinking!","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Whyte Lyon","date":"2017-08-24T14:52:05.381+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So this doesn't breach into the Community Concepts and Creations perimeter?
