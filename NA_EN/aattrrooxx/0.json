Once everyone said it looked weak Riot went ahead and simply made it bigger and left it at that, but the issue is is that most people will never be happy with the ultimate or it's particles I mean look at what people say about {{champion:136}}. I find it's a great ultimate with lots of utility and late game does so much damage that it has won team fights single handed once or twice but people think it isn't god like enough. \n\nIn an ideal world they would give him a VU but it's unlikely as \n\n1. There are a whole host of champions that need it more *cough**cough* Rumble *cough*\n2. His visuals are limited by the fact that he is mostly particles rather than model \n3. If history is anything to go by it aint likely simply because Xerath has always been the forgotten red headed step child \n\nWhat do i mean by that? well if you look at Xerath's history you will realize that he received one of the biggest buffs in the history of the game when Riot changed how MPEN worked in season 3 and nothing happened to Xerath until he got reworked. He's 3 years old but has only had 2 additional skins even though with the powerful elemental fantasy he has, he would surely be an prime candidate for PROGRAM, mecha and Master Arcanist skins. Hell why is he the only ascended champ that doesn't have a galactic skin I mean how hard can it be to have him charging up and throwing star matter at the enemy? Also why is he the only ascended not to have a unique interaction with {{champion:136}}? both are bound god like beings would have thought {{champion:136}} would have something to say, or is it because {{champion:101}} rips him apart? :p\n\nbut this minor rant is moot as if history is anything I'm not going to hold my breath that these things are going to happen","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Wulf Helhammer","date":"2016-04-21T02:18:27.756+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Tested it on the PBE, it's pretty nice.

Her E is castable from 1100 range with a radius of 350, actually exceeding Xerath's range.  And we all know how hard it is to avoid getting hit by her E.

Overall, I think they are worried too much with range and not worried enough with actual design that has something to do with his lore overall.\n\nIt is 'nice' to have a few absurdly ranged shots now and then, but I doubt anyone actually plays Xerath for the Ult (I mean, taking the ult as a major factor in the kit). IMO, his ult should have the ammo mechanic and I will explain why.\n\nI've posted somewhere else on the boards that the whole roots himself concept is outdated. I still do, but now I think it maybe renewed if (it will sound a little bit contradictory) it was closer to how it was before the rework.\n\nXerath's ult could be a toggle where he roots himself and has access to up to 3 to 5 CHARGES (levels 1 to 3) of Power Overwhelming (or any other name). Press R to root and unlock the charges and click to move to uproot.\n\nWhat could he do with those charges? Primarily, shoot them more or less like he does now. The only change here is that if he decides to move, the remaining charges are not lost. They recharge one at a time and would be designed in a way that he more or less always has a charge but takes a while to have all charges available. \n\nSecond use, and here is where things actually make sense lorewise. Since Xerath is trying to escape his prison, his Power Overwhelming Charges would represent his outbursts of energy while trying to break free (the number of charges available at later levels showing how close he is to breaking free). And how he uses those outbursts (besides artillery)? By modifying his other skills. Xerath's kit is not disabled while Ulting, but any other skill he uses consumes a charge of Power Overwhelming for and additional effect (and not damage, unless his kit becomes too lightweight there). Like, using an Arcanopulse while Ulting? Max Range, no charge time, grants speed after Xerath uproots. Use an Eye of Destruction while Ulting? Eye of Destruction gains a few extra units of range and leaves an area of slow for a few seconds. I confess I have not thought of an empowered Shocking Orb, but I think someone can come up with a nice idea here.\n\nJust my thoughts.
