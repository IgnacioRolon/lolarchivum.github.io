This has happened 100% of the times I have played her with the skin. I have not experienced this with any other champion/skin.\n\nHow to reproduce:\n1. buy Lunar Wraith Morgana\n2. play a game with the skin\n3. in next champ select pick Morgana\n4. when it shows which skin to select it should be hovered over her base skin and not her Lunar Wraith skin\n5. Get confused after 10 games and write a bug report","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-02-08T17:37:07.886+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey iguy  - \n\nThanks for the awesome bug report!
