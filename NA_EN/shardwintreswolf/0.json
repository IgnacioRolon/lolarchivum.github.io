The issue is that upon launching the client, the League of Legends logo will appear but will stop without actually launching the client and should I hit the icon again it creates a blue square in the top left side of the screen and freezes. I have attempted to reinstall a few times and still no luck. Same goes for launching it in admin mode and changing permissions. Can't tell what's causing it, so some suggestions would be helpful. Thank you in advance!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-07T02:46:38.221+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmm it definitely sounds like your client is having some problems loading correctly. First let's make sure that check for any damaged or corrupted game files to make sure your installation is working properly. Use our [**Hextech Repair Tool**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367-Automated-Troubleshooting-Hextech-Repair-Tool) and run it with the reinstall and clean uninstall options, and you should be good to go! Let me know if that doesn't seem to be helping though!","replies":[{"poster":"ShardWintreswolf","date":"2017-05-08T00:11:48.629+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No luck after the tool has run it's course and the reinstall completed. Now it will only get as far as the League of Legends logo after the Patcher client is done with it launches the current updated client. It won't produce the blue square any longer but will not allow for anything further as it seemingly closes the client. Any attempts to relaunch with admin permission or changing the permissions are also unsuccessful.\n\nUpon checking the task manager, when the updated client is set to launch, the League patcher process closes and the LeagueClient Ux and League Client processes are listed as running once the logo appears, but will not continue further\n\nI will run the Hextech tool one more time and see if perhaps something was missed, but as of now the issue still remains\n\nEDIT (21:15): Still no luck, though I have also noticed that the LeagueClient and LeagueClient Ux processes is indeed running in the background to some degree after the patcher has been told to launch the updated client and the League of Legends logo appears.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-08T01:17:52.907+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Iiiiinteresting. Since the blue L isn't appearing anymore it kind of sounds like a permissions issue, but it definitely sounds like you've gone through the needed steps to get that fixed as well.
