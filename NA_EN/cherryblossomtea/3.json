My farm and K/D/A's arent as horrible as they used to be at least. But over these years I still haven't figured out how to build item sets on my own. I always use premade or recommended sets and I dont know how to know what Items to build for a specific team comp, or know what to build based on how the game is going. I use the same exact build for every game and I think its holding me back. Im a jhin main.

Unless you're a pro player with a pro support that you duo and practice 8 hours a day and that support is playing only {{champion:16}} {{champion:117}} {{champion:40}} then you cant build for maximum damage, aka full glass canon.\n\nWhat i see people sometimes do and cringe is build an ADC like this {{item:3006}} {{item:3094}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3087}} {{item:3036}} {{item:3095}} , meanwhile exchanging {{item:3095}} for {{item:3072}} on a full build means literally 200-300 hp per auto with a 350 hp shield on top of that while sacrificing almost no damage.\n\nExchanging {{item:3087}}  for {{item:3046}} gives you a 600 more shield and MS to kite out melees while losing essentially nothing in damage since shiv is nerfed to the ground and will add an extra 30 magic every 7th auto while you crit for 400.\n\nAnd finally {{item:3026}} , this little item alone can win you games by making the enemy team blow all their CDs and then dying to your team or just by getting you back in the fight.\n\nWhat im trying to get at is ADCs can basically build full damage while also being super hard to kill and i'm really surprised more people don't do it. \n\nLifesteal is your best friend as an ADC next to your GA.\n\n{{item:3006}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3046}} {{item:3072}} {{item:3026}} {{item:3095}} most ADCs can go this build\n{{item:3006}} {{item:3153}} {{item:3124}} {{item:3046}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3026}} or this if they have some on hit like Vayne\n\nhttps://gyazo.com/36cdccc3640f6b495cb1ad9995e4b5a6","replies":[{"poster":"LightswornLance","date":"2019-12-08T16:02:37.788+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Depends on champion, but on jhin you don't have very good sustained damage so lifesteal isnt the best.

I saw that you play with fleet of footwork. That's good if you want some sustain, but getting electrocute is also another possibility if you want to win a fight in just 2 trades. I personally always felt that fleet of footwork isn't worth it on Jhin, unless if you're on a bad match up, except jhin doesn't really have bad match ups considering his early game is super strong compared to that of the majority of other adcs. Only problem with Jhin is that he naturally pushes harder. So I would much rather take an offensive rune, out-trade the opponent, that way you can take a 3v2 if the enemy jungler comes (or... their lane is so weak that he knows he'd die ganking so he just doesn't gank anymore). You could even try aery for all I care if your only objective is to do 1 auto and then run away. But obviously AA + Q + AA on electrocute is hard to beat in terms of damage.","replies":[]},{"poster":"WalkingInACircle","date":"2019-12-06T19:11:49.846+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hrm...
