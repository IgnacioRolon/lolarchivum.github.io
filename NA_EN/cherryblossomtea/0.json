CSing, positioning, team fighting, map awareness, vision, lane manipulation, how well you know your champ, its counters, what it counters etc, then how you execute all of that together i would say is the core of the game. Once you learn all that and a few things i left out because I'm lazy, i feel you should be able to perform at least at a gold+ level.\n\nBut after that i feel it's quite luck based. Whiny feeders throwing a tantrum and taking it out on the team, 3 autofills, a dc, or a lagger, or someone using a fucking potato to play the game getting 10 FPS in team fights come to mind as shit out of your control, that directly effects the outcome of a match. Match making in general is a nightmare, and completely coin flip. (queue the hate for saying coin flip)\n\nI mean most people at Gold+ just use OP.GG or some shit, and check autofills/champ winrates and dodge accordingly to climb. That kind of really shows a flawed ranked system that really does depend on a lot of factors that are completely out of your control.\n\nBut yeah if you are stuck in iron or bronze or some shit, that's probably due to lack of core game mechanic knowledge. Since most of those elos you can pick a hyper carry and just 1v9. But once you get to where mostly everyone if not everyone knows at least semi what they are doing, theeeeeen it kinda relies a lot on how well your team performs.\n\nI'm sure we have ALL been there, where 5 minutes into the match, your bot lane is already somehow 0-6, and the fed ass enemy bot has arrived to take YOUR lane before you even had a chance to do jack shit. I'm sure there are idiots out there who will go \"winnable\" at that point, but we all know 9 times out of fucking 10 that is a loss, and you will have no impact purely because of how hard the enemy is snowballing. Kinda hard to have an impact when one right click does half your life of HP. \n\nSo yeah, to an extent.

Pretty low samplesize. \nWin % barring K factor changes irrelated the order of a win or loss.  wwlw lwww wlww will all end with the same MMR value assuming identical K and We.\nNow if your going to argue that Streaks matter because your going up in rating thus playing higher rated players so the games harder... your literally admitting to the game being influenced strongly by skill, and that your running into a range your just not exceptional anymore.\n\nPeople treat it like leaderboards. Not like a Balance. They don't account for the MMR offset each loss and win make.  Similar K and similar We is going to negate a loss with a gain and a gain with a loss. 500 W and 500L should be fairly close to the accounts starting MMR value, as long as it had not  been lopsidedly acquired.\n\nPlaying to win in lower MMR is not to complicated with good mechanics, assuming your willing to adapt your playstyle to what's viable there.

The first few years it wasn't too hard to climb, lots of people were new to the game and there was little to no comeback mechanics in the system. \n\nFast forward to today and the average player base (which is around silver-gold) has lots more experience and also a wide range of skill levels due to 1) a natural bell curve because of the sheer number of players in those elos and 2) new accounts in ranked Start around those elos which includes new players and smurfs\n\nThis is why it's become a pretty frustrating point for many. Your top lane might be a bronze player vs a gold, mid might be diamond vs silver, jungle is silver vs silver, and bot lane is gold vs plat. (I'm judging on skill not implying actual rank or their MMR.)\n\nWhen you have such mismatches in skill it feels like a coin flip - i.e. Who got the really good teammates and who got the really bad ones.\n\nSo yes in my opinion it's harder to climb these days.

If I am the WORST player on my team, I will climb.  I can usually keep level with my lane opponent and at WORST can usually keep myself light enough to be carried, I won't go 100%, but can probably be 70-80% WR in this state\n2. If I'm \"mid tier\" on my team, I will probably climb.  Again, I can hold my own in lane and can contribute in line with what's expected of me\n3. If I'm the BEST of my team, I'll have negative WR.  In this state, I will win my lane, sometimes strongly but will usually have at LEAST 2 other lanes losing.  In a rare few games I can rally my team back into it, but more often they either give up by the time lane phase is over or any attempts to help other lanes merely leads to my own lane starting to catch up while I try to deal with enemies who are either as fed or MORESO than myself.\n\nThe argument would be \"that shows you're at your proper elo\", which as I said at the start, is most certainly true.  But the PROBLEM is that you FEEL like you can play with a higher elo, because when I HAVE higher elo teammates (or even EQUAL teammates) I win more than I lose.  The core problem with the \"W/L is all that matters\" situation in ranked (aside from trolls &amp; smurfs) is that I don't WANT to be the superstar of my team.  I don't WANT to be 50-3-2 and hard carrying past scrubs.  I want to play my role in a TEAM game and see our TEAM succeed at what we're trying to do.
