I was very excited to get it, but I've come to realize it is only available in japan. I am quite sad about this, considering its the only icon I have liked enough to want to buy it. I love cherry blossoms and I would be so happy to have this Icon. PLEASE tell me there is some way for me to get it! I want it so bad T^T\r\n{{sticker:cass-cry}} {{sticker:sg-janna}} {{sticker:sg-soraka}}","replies":[]}
