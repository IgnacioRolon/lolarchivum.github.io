I've played one placement and we won. Why was I placed so low? Was it my personal performance or does everyone start low? I was two ranks higher at the end of last season. How much will it change now until the end of my placements? Does the LP work like it does after placements? \nThanks {{sticker:vlad-salute}}","replies":[{"poster":"Darkdemon653","date":"2020-01-12T02:19:33.026+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=CherryBlossomTea,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=JI0t5yle,comment-id=,timestamp=2020-01-12T00:45:32.314+0000)\n>\n>I've played one placement\n\nPlay the rest.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sukishoo","date":"2020-01-12T01:00:09.448+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Everyone tends to start lower than they were if they had played in a previous season. This season though feels a little off imo as I've seen a lot of people place way lower than they have in previous years.  If you get wins though during placements it goes up a lot faster as they are generally 60-70LP.  After that it usually drops down to 30 or less LP pre-win as it evens you out.","replies":[{"poster":"CherryBlossomTea","date":"2020-01-12T01:03:46.912+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah.
