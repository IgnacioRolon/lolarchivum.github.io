The game was running fine yesterday, today, not so much. I think I've tried to play 4 games today, and of those 4 games, so far, I've been able to play the last minute of one of them - I can't even begin to describe how great it was to spawn as a level 2 ezreal, while all my teammates and the bots (because i tried to test a game where only 5 people need to be in it and the practice tool worked fine) were level 10-12. You guys I think I made it to the nexus on my side before the game ended. Seriously, that may have been the best game of league I've played yet. (sarcasm) Anyway, I'm a little bummed about this crap, anyone find a fix for it yet? I'm pretty sure I shouldn't have to reinstall league more than once a year....","replies":[]},{"poster":"sswwoonn","date":"2017-07-18T16:57:55.010+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"same issue.......terrible really. how long does it take to fix a small problem","replies":[]},{"poster":"JYP","date":"2017-07-01T01:10:41.835+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tired of this issue, had it since 7.11..... {{champion:17}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Not Warwick","date":"2017-01-13T04:41:20.792+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have this issue as well. Tried to do my first provisional and sadly I got the same black screen and warning. Everything else works perfectly on my laptop and it's definitely not an issue with the internet as I'm capable of browsing and streaming.\n\nEdit: It's kind of unpleasant that I have to start the season with a remake/loss despite just trying to play the game. I'm glad the remake system is put into place so my teammates do not have to suffer a 4v5. However, it's very off putting and dissatisfying. In all honesty it has negatively impacted my experience with the game. \n\nAdditionally, I wasn't the only one who had a client crash in the game.
