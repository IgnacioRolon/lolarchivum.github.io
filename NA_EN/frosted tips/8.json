She offers a little too much pick potential from such a safe position. I really think her E needs a late game cooldown nerf. It just seems up way too frequently for how strong the ability is.","replies":[{"poster":"Craft Zeppelin","date":"2019-03-04T13:06:19.498+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or, there is legit nothing to pick aside from fricking cassiopeia and lissandra.\nBy the way, that TSM fight? 5 kill Zoe and the crowd goes crazy, but 0/3/4 Aatrox 1v3ing and ending the game nobody bats a eye lmao","replies":[]},{"poster":"General Matty","date":"2019-03-04T12:34:15.675+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Rule No.34 of league: Nobody likes Zoe.","replies":[{"poster":"lolipopevelynn","date":"2019-03-04T14:03:19.042+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=General Matty,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=GBOoplTB,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2019-03-04T12:34:15.675+0000)\n>\n> Rule No.34 of league: Nobody likes Zoe.\n\nR34 zoe?
