This was meant to allow anyone to use any rune they wanted. They accomplished this by giving every rune a hybrid scaling or giving it adaptive damage. But, when they added Conqueror it seems they forgot give this rune any adaptive ability. The rune only gives bonus AD when activated and will never give bonus AP.\r\n\r\nSo my question to you is why? Why does Conqueror only give bonus AD?\r\n\r\nIMO Riot should give it bonus AP and maybe some AP fighters would arise from this change, or better yet some new playstyles for champion. I think some champion that could use it would be {{champion:131}} {{champion:245}} {{champion:60}} {{champion:79}} {{champion:82}} {{champion:76}} and {{champion:68}} \r\n\r\nLastly, do you guys believe it could be a good addition to the game?","replies":[{"poster":"HéntaiSénpai","date":"2018-08-23T13:01:35.698+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think Conquerer should just be removed.
