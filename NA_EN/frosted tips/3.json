Punishing her for using W, would be a more favorable type of nerf strategy while keeping her assassination skills strong when used correctly. \nI do not think Riot is punishing an Akali player enough for using their W, else she is a well-designed champion.\n\nThank you, for not making a rant.

All of these reduce her healing.\n\n2. If you have a Brand, Nasus or Leona on your team, you can force her out of her shroud; AoE champions (especially with hard CC) are too much for Akali to handle. Especially someone like Annie with a 2 second stun or Nasus with a massive slow; you can stop her from fighting and make her have to ult away.\n\n3. Ninja champions have massive mobility, ability resource and damage at the cost of predictability and the fact that they can easily be taken down if more than one healthy target is before them.\n\nHopefully this helps. {{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[{"poster":"Frosted Tips","date":"2018-12-03T16:21:49.435+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Number 2 is wrong.

True stealth would imply that nothing reveals Akali when she shrouds, but she is still revealed by turrets and true sight, and she appears as a white silhouette, she just can't be targetted by single target spells and AAs.\n\n1. I disagree on the too much sustain on Q specifically, it's a really minimal amount by itself. It only starts ramping up once Akali gets gunblade, which is usually 12-16 minutes into the game. It also has counterplay, you can build morello, executioners or bramble vest to apply greavous wounds and gimp her healing. One of those, and some magic resist will really slow down her power spikes and make you much harder to all in from the Akali's perspective.\n\n2. This I think is a decent idea. It wouldn't have to be nerfed very much, just enough to weave an aa or an extra ability in.\n\n3. Also disagree. Akali needs the large amount of energy given from her shroud due to her using literally half her energy bar using 1 Q. Now the cost lowers with each level up but it's still quite large. If they decided to nerf this she would need a compensation buff to the energy restore on her passive.\n\nGlad some people can post about nerfing Akali without crying for half the post. Really helps me want to contribute to the discussion.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Elisza Kitsune","date":"2018-12-03T21:57:46.714+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be fair; her old healing was extremely potent compared to her's now [some even built tank and still oneshot] and she's kind of weak in her early levels but it shouldn't scale super hard.

Turrets in League are supposed to be eagle eye and go something like this: \"i see you! take my fist to the face!\" but with Akali's shroud it's like \"oh...who spray painted my eyes?!? I see a blurry ghost i'll just blindly shoot around hoping i get you!\"\n\nAs for her e, it needs to have a range limit. Not even WW can do this much leaping like Akali and he's a mutated wolf compared to some Ionian human.\n\nakali's already on my list of badly designed champions.\nEven if i make her 0/10 (because of how predictable she can be) i still have the urge to punch the wall due to how frustrating she is.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GayFluffyUnicorn","date":"2018-12-03T19:28:47.628+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":5,"body":"She has exactly the same problems as old akali. Which really speaks for certainlyt and yes i'm derailing this thread a bit to shit on him deservedly so. \n\nLow interactivity/counterplay and too much sustain. \n\nAnd you pointed out her problems perfectly. Fuck the true stealth noone cares. \nHer being able to harass/trade you without you being able to trade back is one of the biggest problems of old and new akali. Maybe if you play on 5 ping and have a 14 yos reaction time you might be able to get one auto through but other than that there is no chance in hell you trade her back. \n\nThen there is her sustain where you will say \"oh but she has to use her Q for it\". Yes she has to use an ability that costs nothing to heal back massive amounts of hp she lost in a bad trade. B B B BUT THEN SHE CANT ATTACK YOU, yea but you also cannot force her to attack due to E and W. So simply cannot abuse her supposed counterplay because her kit covers her \"weaknesses\". Y'know a fact a lot of certainlyt champs (but not only his unfortunately) have in common. \n\nHer stealth duration is just too long. Someone who watches high elo akali play will notice how akali can zone entire teams off for 8 seconds just by throwing down her shroud. It has such ridiculous amounts of power it's insane. \n\nHer kit needs a lot of work before it gets bareable. \n\nSustain and shroud need massive work.","replies":[]},{"poster":"xDelightifyx","date":"2018-12-03T16:48:48.765+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":7,"body":"Every spell needs to be gutted.
