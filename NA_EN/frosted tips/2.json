I have definitely liked the champion in different ways throughout her journey. Now I&#039;m just going to get into it. This is a post suggesting a different direction from the mistake that will occur if the current direction is taken.\r\n\r\nPassive: Gathering Fire - Karma stores up energy. Karma gains 1 stack from basic attacking enemy champions, 3 for shielding champion damage from an ally, and 5 when Karma damages an enemy with an ability. At 100 stacks Karma will be able to use her Mantra an additional time while it is on cooldown consuming the stored energy.\r\n\r\nQ: Inner Flame - Fires a blast of energy that explodes on enemy contact dealing 80 / 125 / 170 / 215 / 260 (+60% of ability power) magic damage to enemies in the area and slowing them by 25% for 1.25 seconds.\r\n\r\nI also kept Inner Flame the same. It is a simple ability that with my version of it&#039;s Mantra form will be very strong.\r\n\r\nR+Q: Soulflare- Inner Flame deals 25 / 75 / 125 / 175 (+30% of ability power) extra magic damage and leaves a circle of flame at the impact area or upon reaching maximum range, slowing enemies for 50%. After 1.5 seconds, the circle erupts, dealing 50 / 150 / 250 / 350 (+60% of ability power) magic damage to enemies in the area and applying brittle to all enemy champions.\r\n\r\nPretty simple buff here. Adding brittle to the eruption portion of Soulflare adds some more supportive potential to Karna&#039;s kit. This may seem like a pretty big buff, but it will even out with some changes you have yet to see.\r\n\r\nW(Enemy Cast): Focused Resolve - Karma forms a tether to target enemy champion, revealing and damaging the target for 60 / 110 / 160 / 210 / 260 (+90% of ability power) magic damage over 2 seconds (one tick[35% of the damage] at the start of the cast and one at the end[65% of the damage]). Gathering Fire is applied every time this ability damages. If the tether is not broken after the 2/1.75/1.5/1.25/1 seconds, the target is rooted for 1.5 seconds\r\n\r\nSo my main changes here is that the time it takes to root is lowered per level instead of the duration of the root. 2 seconds is a long time and it is just not reasonable for Karma to ever do that in a teamfight unless she is purely getting chased down. Now the tether duration is a static 1.5 seconds which is stronger early, but significantly weaker later on to compensate for the shorter duration to root. Damage is now more focused on the the full tether.\r\n\r\nR+W(Enemy Cast): Renewal - Focused Resolve increases the duration of the root by 0.5 / 0.75 / 1 / 1.25 seconds and heals Karma for 20% (+1% per 100 ability power) of her missing health immediately plus another 20% (+1% per 100 ability power) of her missing health if the tether remains unbroken.\r\n\r\nI don&#039;t love this Mantra effect, but I really don&#039;t have any good suggestion in changing it, so I left it alone.\r\n\r\nW(Ally): Focused Harmony - Karma forms a tether to target ally champion combining their defenses, giving herself and the targeted ally bonus armor and magic resist over the next 2 seconds. Karma and her ally receive 10/15/20/25/30+(20% bonus armor and magic resist form each other).\r\n\r\nSo Karma receives a 20% of her allys bonus armor and magic resist and her ally receives 20% of Karma&#039;s bonus armor and magic resist. This is a way to make her more of a battlemage support. She likes to be in the thick of it.\r\n\r\nR+W(Ally Cast): Enlighten - Karma and her target ally heal for 10% (+0.5% per 100 ability power) of their missing health immediately plus another 10% (+0.5% per 100 ability power) of their missing health if the tether remains unbroken.\r\n\r\nThis ability can really save an ally, but really doesn&#039;t heal for a ton.\r\n\r\nE: Inspire - Karma shields target ally, which absorbs 70 / 95 / 120 / 145 / 170 (+50% of ability power) damage for 2.5 seconds and grants the target 40 / 45 / 50 / 55 / 60% bonus movement speed for 1.5 seconds.\r\n\r\nKeeping it the same. Offers a unique buff to a shield.\r\n\r\nR+E: Defiance: Inspire&#039;s shield overflows with energy, increasing the target&#039;s shield amount by 30 / 100 / 170 / 240 (+30% of ability power). The Shield erupts with the overflowing energy dealing damage to nearby enemies equal to the total shield amount.\r\n\r\nI know this is where I&#039;m going to lose a lot of people, but hear me out. I tried to add almost purely supportive power to her Q and her W to make this change not force her to be a mid laner. I believe Kamra should be able to be played both Mid and Support. I would really like her to succeed in both those roles, but she has zero chance to succeed Mid without more access to the enemy backline then just her easily blockable Q. I hope both sides can understand this.\r\n\r\nR: Mantra - Karma empowers her next ability cast within the next 8 seconds, adding an additional effect. Empowered abilities share the same cooldown as their basic form.\r\n\r\nKarma begins with one rank in Mantra and can increase it at levels 6, 11, and 16. Ranks in Mantra improve the additional effects of empowered abilities.\r\n\r\nKept the same.\r\n\r\nAs of right now all cooldowns and mana costs and base stats would stay the same except her base armor and magic resist would be reduced by 3 a piece because of her new W.\r\n\r\nSo what do you think? Would love to discuss any issues/concerns/suggestions or whatever with anyone.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-11-30T03:24:10.161+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a mastery 7 karma, i find the idea of being able to doublecast R to be complete and utter bullcrap.\n\nIt will degenerate into Karma support poking a bit and then going ham with RQRQ for a free kill at lv3 or so, not to mention all the other BS combos.","replies":[{"poster":"Frosted Tips","date":"2018-11-30T03:58:12.221+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It doesn't take your Q off cooldown though, so you would have to wait until your Q is back up to RQRQ.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-11-30T04:04:52.282+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Q has a meaningful cooldown?\n\nBy the time they flail out of the first RQ and flee, the next should be about ready to go.\n\nEither way, it would just overload her kit even more, force massive nerfs, and not change much of anything.","replies":[{"poster":"Frosted Tips","date":"2018-11-30T04:11:40.922+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"7 second cooldown at level 1 and 6.5 seconds at level 2 the max you could have at the time with 1.5 seconds of maximum slow duration. At most you could have 10% CDR at level 3 so that means the lowest cooldown possible would be 5.85 seconds, and take 1.5 seconds off because of the slow so it is 4.35 seconds minimum between the end of the first RQ and the start of the second RQ.\n\nAlso that's if you stack your passive to 100 by level three and those numbers could be reduced to make the effect take longer to get access to.\n\nIf that is found to be too strong then I would suggest that the passive Mantra could not cast the most recent regular Mantra ability.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
