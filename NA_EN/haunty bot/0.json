I had no issues playing until about a month in when after an update I started getting consistently high ping. I've gone through riot support and used the Hextech Tool or whatever, with none of the offered solutions having any success. I work with network and computer equipment so I have a good amount of knowledge in this area.\n\nI've been told that \"this game requires a constant connection and it may be the quality of my internet.\" I pay $150 a month for the highest speed comcast offers in my area so it is *not* a connection issue on my end.\n\nNow, the current PC I have has an Intel Core I7 2600K with an XFX R7800 Series graphics card. By no means is this newer or even great equipment but it is *more* than enough to handle this game and I even have to limit the fps to 144 in the settings otherwise it wants to try spiking into the 400s, which runs my cpu pretty dry. I've even swapped out my motherboard as my previous one didn't support 5G Wi-Fi or ethernet connections and this has also had no results. So I know that my hardware is not the problem here.\n\nAnother thing to note here is that while play versus AI I do not experience any ping issues. And if I sit in base, or keep my champion away from other ones physically, it also keeps me at a stable 40 ping, sometimes spiking to 55. But as soon as my champion goes near an allied or enemy champion I begin experiencing 800+ ping, sometimes upwards of 2,000 or more which is just, well, unplayable.\n\nI really want to play this game again, but every time I queue up a match I have such horrid ping that I get mass reported for trolling and end up in low priority and sometimes the packet loss is so high that the game think I afk'ed and leaver buster hits me - **HARD**.\n\nHas anyone experienced these issues, or found a solution to it? I would greatly appreciate any input I can get here.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-08T02:50:02.344+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you tried updating some of your network settings to make sure your connection is being routed in the best way yet? Check out the steps in this [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) on how to configure your Port Forwarding and DNS options to make sure your connection gets a good start when it leaves your network. \n\nTypically that's able to get you a clearer signal to our servers, which seems to be the problem since AI games run a lot smoother (most likely due to there being less overall connections being handled).","replies":[{"poster":"Haunty Bot","date":"2017-11-08T03:04:56.565+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I looked at what the site recommends as default settings and all my settings are fine. I use a custom firewall that flicks off at the touch of a button so that isn't the issue. My router supports both IPv4 and IPv6 connections so that isn't the problem either. The Hextech tool says I'm spiking up to 800 ping consistently.\n\nI have tried troubleshooting different connection types but I get hit with leaverbuster so much, and the problem only occurs in PvP which isn't an optimal place for troubleshooting. I guess I'll keep trying and if I get banned, well, then I get banned.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-08T03:23:19.146+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wouldn't recommend trying this over and over in matchmade games since I don't want you getting punishments for troubleshooting.
