I then unlocked it as a skin perm, but it showed some error, telling me to restart the client.\r\nSo I did and after I went back the perm shard was still there, but it already unlocked the skin. Isn't the shard supposed to be gone or is it just like that?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-02T22:48:26.975+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh wow....huh....yea that's not supposed to happen xD!\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}} \n\nI double checked and you do have the skin unlocked, so you're free to disenchant that extra shard. Not sure why it wasn't removed to begin with but it should have been ¯\\ _(ツ)_/¯","replies":[]}]}
