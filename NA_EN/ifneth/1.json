Almost every interaction with worked ground sets one off, and since she&rsquo;s almost always interacting with worked ground, there&rsquo;s no time for her other lines.  My guess is that the engine has an internal timer to prevent passive lines from being spoken too often, and these new ones refresh it.  I have heard them all, and almost nothing but them, for every one of my few games with her tonight.\n\nPlease, reduce their frequency.  I loved her old lines and want to hear them, too.  They were diverse and interesting and showed off her character, and there were quite a few of them, too.  Also, because a couple of her new lines are rock puns (&ldquo;pebble browser&rdquo; and &ldquo;I wish rocks could give pep talks&rdquo;) those in particular get old fast and unintentionally make a joke of our little sparrow.  Please, cut their rate down.\n\nEdit: Apologies for Title Typo","replies":[{"poster":"semipriceysoap","date":"2018-03-27T01:00:31.038+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"hey hey!

WOOO!\n\nEdit: Here’s a list of as many of the lines as I can remember.\n\n(On getting gold, whether from minions or champions) “New supplies!”\n\n(On leaving worked ground) “Nothing like a patch of fresh earth to clear the head.”\n\n(On leaving worked ground) “Ah, a clean slate.”\n\n(On walking past inhibitor turret) “Time to get going!”\n\n(On stepping onto worked ground) “I can’t squeeze much more from this stone.”\n\nI never once heard any of these lines before the sound engine update, though I did hear something like them on her Freljord skin.  Having heard the lines on her base skins often since, I have come to understand why they exist and now want to keep hearing them—at an appropriate frequency.  Will you make sure of that?\n","replies":[{"poster":"semipriceysoap","date":"2018-03-27T04:14:33.575+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heck yeah you were!!! :D \n\nThis was actually a coincidence that it happened around the same patch as our sound engine update.

Any advice?\n\nI made the same switch and would love to help.  Please add me in-game.  I’ll help you however I can!\n\n****\n\n**My Story**\nADC in 2k17 just couldn’t carry in Bronze, especially since I was playing Ashe.  So, I switched back to midlane, which is what I originally wanted to play.  I tried Lux, one of my first few champions, but she wasn’t very good.  Anivia was way too hard and clunky.  I read through all the midlane mages, seeking a champion.\n\nI won’t play evil (LeBlanc) or dubious (Corki) or even ambiguous (Aurelion Sol) champions, and I will only play champions who make the best choice, not just a good one.  Taliyah was literally the only one available.  I had seen her on the champion roster before, not to mention occasionally in glimpses of pro play.  Though I cringed at her short bio, I steeled myself and bought the champion.\n\nIt’s been an experience.  I relate to her a lot.  Her story is as epic as that of Ashe.  She is just as noble, brave, bright, and determined.  Few midlaners have ever been as well designed, both for their players and their opponents.  I think I have ever seen a few complaints about her the whole time I’ve read the boards—and almost always in the form a rare comment in a thread about least-favorite champions.\n\n**Gameplay**\nShe leaves you feeling like you’re playing a really fair champion.  You deserve your wins.  There’s no cheese or high-mechanics-low-stats nonsense.  Yet she’s also incredibly strong.  She has the range of an artillery mage, the waveclear of a scaling mage, the burst of an all-in mage, and a roaming ultimate.  Her laning is safe, her snowball is strong, and her item builds are both diverse and viable.  Oh, and did I mention that she has safe, strong laning and lots of outplay potential, both at the macro and micro levels?\n\nTaliyah mains are rare, and she does have some mechanics, so you get to be part of a small group of players who main a champ that has respect from the community.  But they’re all really sweet people because mains tend to be like their champions, and Taliyah is kind-hearted.  No edgelords or skill-fiends here.  \n\n**Tips**\nHer early gameplay revolves around landing her Threaded Volley during laning phase to poke her opponent while managing the Worked Ground it leaves behind.  A Seismic Shove over Unraveled Earth will deal lots of damage throughout the game.  Once she has lane control, which can happen as early as level 2, she can roam to other lanes by using her passive.  Her ultimate only enhances these roams.  Gain a lead during the first 10 minutes to get the snowball rolling.\n\nHer mid-game is solid.  She can wall enemies off objectives like turrets, dragons, and the Rift Herald.  Her shove-earth combo damage approaches the one-shot threshold for any squishy champion.  Her threaded volley cooldown will become equal to its duration, letting her keep the damage going for early or sneaky Barons.  Keep the snowball rolling or risk falling off as tanks build Magic Resistance.\n\nHer late-game is stealth OP.  With Liandry’s Torment, she does %HP damage that refreshes on every rock of her volley.  Rylai’s applies a slow on every rock and also doubles the burn.  Void Staff, or Morellonomcion against teams not building Magic Resistance, lets her punch through tanks.  That spell has _1,000 range_, which is more than almost any ability in the game.  Tanks can’t engage on you.  Mages can’t poke back.  Marksmen are nearly helpless.  Unless the enemy team can dive you during a teamfight, you will scale into a fountain laser, even without forgoing a defensive item for Deathcap. \n\nOne of her basic combos is to walk up, cast Unraveled Earth to slow an opponent, and knock them over the rocks with Seismic Shove while they’re slowed.  Once she has Rylai’s Crystal Scepter, she can set up the combo with a slow proc’d by landing Threaded Volley.","replies":[{"poster":"HonestJohnTheCon","date":"2018-03-25T12:15:39.799+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks!
