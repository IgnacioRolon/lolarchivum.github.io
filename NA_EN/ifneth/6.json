I want to know: what brought you to playing a Tank in League of Legends?","replies":[{"poster":"Baron Barian","date":"2018-10-19T08:46:43.286+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"So many people want to be super flash and score tons of kills and offer nothing to their team in return and blame everyone else for not starting a fight.  I, however, have always appreciated the more subtle ways of bringing the pain to the enemies. That feeling of walking towards a Lucian ulting and just eating every single bullet without stopping is something no flashy carry can do, and boy is it ever satisfying to be that giant, buffed beast.\n\nAlso, the one thing I've learned from playing support is that the only thing squishies are good at is finding the fastest way to kill themselves. Hence why I love tank-supports like Braum and Tahm Kench.","replies":[{"poster":"ZT Xperimentor","date":"2018-10-27T09:47:09.752+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Juggernauts feel the similar, that impressive steady march into their team, but being able to bury whoever's in the way.\n\nAlso agree about braum and tahm, but kind of a problem when they're some mobile champion and keep running from you, though still amusing in a morbid sense.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SweetSoulBrother","date":"2018-10-19T08:59:21.562+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be honest tank mains are either the silent heroes or minimalist when it comes to finding rewards.  Like the friend who likes to see their friend succeed at what they do, while providing a helping hand when they can. \n\nEven though when i play Solo I stray away from tanks when top, I usually look and ask what my friends are playing. So versatile champions that can adjust on the fly or even in the last seconds of drafting are best for me. My fave pick has been and probably always be J4. A simple champ design , yet a versatile one.  Assassin, bruiser, tank or the always fun support aura tank build . Either way i find a way to squeeze the pick into the team comp and provide what is lacking to the best of my abilities. Any versatile tank is always on my mind. They may not be the best at any of the roles but my team will not be caught lacking peel and protection.\n\nother champs I can flex with Are Naut, Maokai, Shen or  Poppy.\n\nMost of the above is redundant but I'm too lazy to edit at 4 AM.
