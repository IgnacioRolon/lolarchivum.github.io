I have since solved the problem by clicking the \"Verify Email\" link, which led me through a process to receive the email.  I suggest that this link be displayed more prominently, or that the verification email be sent automatically, without the user having to guess which link to click and then take the aforementioned additional steps.  Also, your customer service is excellent.","replies":[]}]}]}
