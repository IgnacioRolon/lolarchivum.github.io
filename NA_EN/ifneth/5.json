I don&#039;t know how else to say this, but I read the Star Guardian lore, and I couldn&#039;t help but feel like there were either Freudian slips or bizarrely-sexual references throughout.  It wasn&#039;t just barely-justified references to a champion&#039;s lifting their &quot;long legs&quot; over a rock or Lux&#039;s wishing she&#039;d worn a &quot;bikini top and shorts&quot; because of the heat.  Even mundane tasks were described in ways that I couldn&#039;t help but blink at, baffled by the choice of words.\r\n\r\nBeauty, even allure, are certainly parts of the Star Guardian theme and the themes of the Star Guardian champions themselves, but if the gnawing feeling I described above is accurate, then there&#039;s something *creepy* in that lore.  I hope that Riot doesn&#039;t repeat it.","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2018-01-12T11:18:30.844+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The Star Guardian skins are based on magical girl anime and manga.

However, Magical Girl stories take breaks between moments of fanservice, whereas I found one weird Star Guardian innuendo after another.  And even if the Magical Girl genre is known for having that much fanservice, there’s no rule that Star Guardian must, and we should ask ourselves if we really want it to.  Personally... it just made me really uncomfortable.","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2018-01-12T21:20:41.119+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly on my first read through I didn't even notice anything like that, I will have to go back through and read it again.

The story was otherwise interesting and well-written, with accurate and expressive characters.  I want to enjoy it.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Blood Magicks","date":"2018-01-12T11:08:46.200+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mostly agree with you but can you make a full list of sentences that made you uncomfortable?

The stuff I found was so unsettling that I would rather not think about it, lest my imagination should never unsee it. :-( However, you can just read the first chapter’s kitchen scene to see my point.","replies":[]}]}]}
