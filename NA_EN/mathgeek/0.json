However in team fights the FPS will drop from 141 to low 100s or 90s.  However, on games like Overwatch FPS will stay at 150 through out the game.  Both games are set to max graphic settings but in league I have shadows turned off.  Also I update my graphics drivers and that did not help.  I am wondering if this is normal and if it is not normal how do I fix it?\r\n\r\nThank you for any help","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-11-09T22:54:42.961+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Grats on your new rig!

Kind of annoying to deal with.  I also did not see a reason why Overwatch worked fine but league did not.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
