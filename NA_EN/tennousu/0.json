If the average health contributed throughout the game from Overgrowth is 200, and Shield Bash scales %1.5 on health, then that's an average of an extra 3 damage/proc.

A lot of adcs already second slot Resolve, and they are losing Bone plating\n\nThis rune + Revitalize on an adc as secondary runes pretty much = a 5% increase in the power of Life steal, 5% greater shield size, and  a HUGE on hit bonus. Why wouldn't they?\n\nKeep in mind they are taking the raw stats out of the rune page too, so a player will be able to take Resolve Secondary without taking the Bonus HP mod. They can take Resolve Secondary, and add AD to it, meaning Precision + Resolve will have Attack speed/AD mods.\n\nThey basically are re-introducing the old runes (there's even a 1-10% CDR rune for those who used to build CDR builds)","replies":[{"poster":"I lit your baby","date":"2018-10-24T10:15:43.321+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A lot?Literally no one using resolve on adc. \n\nNot sure about it's exact mechanic, but lets believe the description:\nso when you get shield, your next attack deals bonus dmg.\nFirst of all, i'm sure, this will work against creeps - already useless.\nEven if not, this is just 1 attack, because you still have shield after procing bash.\n\nSecondary, exept Draven or Jhin, no one will abuse it, because gathering storm much better in every way.\nAnd still 90 dmg is...meh,  at 20 minutes you already getting more with sorcery runes, than bash allows you to at his maximum, dont forget, youre forced to buy bloodthirster as your 1-2 item.","replies":[{"poster":"True Garen","date":"2018-10-31T20:55:05.569+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Forced Abortion,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=4T5R5shN,comment-id=0002000100000000000000000000,timestamp=2018-10-24T10:15:43.321+0000)\n>\n> A lot?Literally no one using resolve on adc. \n> \n> Not sure about it&#x27;s exact mechanic, but lets believe the description:\n> so when you get shield, your next attack deals bonus dmg.\n> First of all, i&#x27;m sure, this will work against creeps - already useless.\n> Even if not, this is just 1 attack, because you still have shield after procing bash.\n> \n> Secondary, exept Draven or Jhin, no one will abuse it, because gathering storm much better in every way.\n> And still 90 dmg is...meh,  at 20 minutes you already getting more with sorcery runes, than bash allows you to at his maximum, dont forget, youre forced to buy bloodthirster as your 1-2 item.\n\nIt doesn't \"work against creeps\". The description says \"next basic attack against a champion\", within 4s of gaining the shield (you could even kill a few creeps and keep the buff).\n\n It may or may not turn out to be an effective option for ranged champions, but pretty clearly, this was the kind of interaction that the sponsors of this Rune were going for. The possibility for a champion to buy into Resolve (especially now that stat bonuses are seperate) - Extra damage on rapidly decaying shields like Overheal, and supports with spammable shields providing benefit even when there was no obvious reason to use the shield. Overheal gave value to heal procs at full health, and Shield Bash gives value to shield procs with no damage to mitigate. With Overheal feeding into Shield Bash.\n\nOverheal reduced the factor of restraint in heals. Shield Bash reduces the need for restraint in shielding.\n\nWith Overheal, the support doesn't need to save Relic Shield for when the ADC is low. Instead, with the Shield, the ADC can try for a play.\n\nWith Shield Bash, I might not wait to cast the Shield when the ADC is actually threatened. I might cast to increase his damage. It's not a lot, but it's not insignificant either, and it can add up.\n\nAnd since it synergizes with several other mechanics it could be viable. Now that the shielding is increased %10, it might even be worse. Not for oppressive late game damage. But for an unpleasant amount of increased sustain in laning. I'm still thinking about dual relic shield bottom lanes with Overheal. But with this rune you don't even need the ADC to wear relic to make it work.\n\nWhen the dual relic strategy was meta earlier this year, the ADC did not take Sorcery secondary. The ADC went Resolve, to get the Revitalize buff. (The support also took Revitalize.)\n\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"True Garen","date":"2018-10-27T16:15:56.480+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Forced Abortion,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=4T5R5shN,comment-id=0002000100000000000000000000,timestamp=2018-10-24T10:15:43.321+0000)\n>\n> A lot?Literally no one using resolve on adc. \n> \n> Not sure about it&#x27;s exact mechanic, but lets believe the description:\n> so when you get shield, your next attack deals bonus dmg.\n> First of all, i&#x27;m sure, this will work against creeps - already useless.\n> Even if not, this is just 1 attack, because you still have shield after procing bash.\n> \n> Secondary, exept Draven or Jhin, no one will abuse it, because gathering storm much better in every way.\n> And still 90 dmg is...meh,  at 20 minutes you already getting more with sorcery runes, than bash allows you to at his maximum, dont forget, youre forced to buy bloodthirster as your 1-2 item.\n\nYou're not forced to buy Bloodthirster. Just take Overheal and either Fleet Footwork or Bloodlines or both.

Focus gives 24ad and gathering storm in late game is frequently 48 ad.\n\nNo. I meant how much damage does an ADC pull from another comparable secondary rune?\n\nYou're right about the Sorcery Secondary runes - in low mmr Gathering Storm can be a beast. The game doesn't calculate damage contribution from all runes the same way (I wish that it did).  But by 30m, that's probably around %10 more AD. If you take the rune, and the game goes long, it will contribute more damage than your other 5 runes combined.\n\nI was approaching it the other way: With a support with a spammable shield, and overheal and bloodthirster etc....The rune could be procced a few times a minute. Probably 100 times in a longer game. If it gave an average of 25 damage each time... that's 2500 damage against champions from the rune throughout the game. (With a chance for some much larger hits, by using Locket, for example.)\n\nI don't think that ranged champions who go sorcery secondary will switch over either... You have to be consistently be regaining and losing the shield to get any use out of Shield Bash since it requires a NEW shield to proc it. On an ADC it may not be worth taking, considering you don't want to be hit in the first place and therefore will never lose the shield and proc the rune again (at least not as frequently as a melee fighter will).\n\nWe might see another iteration of the Duo Relic Shield Bottom lane... Shield Bash might make it more attractive. Last year, increased damage wasn't even a factor...\n\nRiven on the other hand...","replies":[]},{"poster":"True Garen","date":"2018-10-30T01:42:05.989+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Forced Abortion,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=4T5R5shN,comment-id=0002000100000000000000000000000100000000000000000000,timestamp=2018-10-29T21:38:34.273+0000)\n>\n> You&#x27;re forced because overheal shield  gives you at max ~50-200 hp(which is 17 dmg if sona/nami will heal you, dont forget, that you&#x27;re building overheal much slower by yourself)\n> Bloodthirster gives you a lot of vamp, so you&#x27;re building this shield in 1 hit better, then with any other source(also it gives decent amount of dmg)\n> \n> theoretically, even if yur team have jhin with overheal, bloodthirster, another vamp item + vamp rune(in total these are 40-43% lifesteal) 3 fire dragons and baron\n> And imagine he will crit for like ~1400-9999 dmg, the next his attack will deal 22(base)+30(bloodthirster)+17(overheal) dmg\n> \n> \n> It&#x27;s not even close to be good.\n\nCompared to what?\n\nAlso, it will proc from shield casting supports (not just heals funnelled through Overheal.).","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Z3Sleeper","date":"2018-10-24T16:28:52.378+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why not?
