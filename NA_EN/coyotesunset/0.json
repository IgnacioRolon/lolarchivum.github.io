Just click on whatever seems interesting. There are a lot of artworks there, so you can really get a feel for each faction. Additionally, there are a lot of links to the universe site; champion biographies, short stories and the like. It's handy to keep the map bookmarked, since most names of towns, mountains, rivers, and regions referenced in short stories are marked on it.\nOnce you feel like you want to read something I'd recommend reading the short stories that aren't specific to a single champions by searching in the region sections of the universe site.\nA few recommendations are [Shadow and Fortune](https://universe.leagueoflegends.com/en_us/story/shadow-and-fortune-story), [Turmoil](https://universe.leagueoflegends.com/en_us/story/turmoil), [The Eye in the Abyss](https://universe.leagueoflegends.com/en_us/story/the-eye-in-the-abyss), [The Principles of Strenght](https://universe.leagueoflegends.com/en_us/story/trifarian-legion), [Progress Day](https://universe.leagueoflegends.com/en_us/story/piltover-progress-day), [Where Icathia Once Stood](https://universe.leagueoflegends.com/en_US/story/where-icathia-once-stood/), and [City of Iron and Glass](https://universe.leagueoflegends.com/en_us/story/zaun-cityironglass).\n\nI know it's a lot, but those stories should give you a summary of the current state of most regions. Of course if something intrigues you, like a specific champion or region, feel free to explore. In fact, I think that is the best way to learn about the lore. Find something that interests you and read everything about it.\n\nI've seen some people recommend watching Necrit. If you decide to watch some of his videos, be aware that he often gets things wrong or is stating theory as fact. You can get quick summaries from his videos, but take what he says with a grain of salt.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Riot Scathlocke","date":"2019-11-13T00:04:55.702+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":5,"body":"I'm appalled that no one has yet recommended you read **'Realms of Runeterra'**, much of which is geared toward folks who are looking to get into the lore/setting...\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-popcorn}}","replies":[{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2019-11-13T01:19:58.182+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"It's appalling that no one recommended the one thing about league lore you have to pay for?","replies":[]},{"poster":"HalfTangible","date":"2019-11-13T17:04:58.966+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"You gotta pay for that.\n\nWhy would anyone pay for lore on something they know nothing about?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2019-11-13T18:46:18.370+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"I put together a Bilgewater (ocean-going monster hunting, bounty hunting, and piratical region) recommended reading guide about a year ago, if that takes your fancy?\n\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/story-art/idaBsEQv-getting-in-to-the-lore-bilgewater-guide-unofficialish\n\nA lot of the other suggestions here are also fantastic.
