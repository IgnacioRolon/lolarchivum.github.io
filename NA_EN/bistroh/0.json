As for gameplay I have been playing mostly assassins and have been moving into some mages such as Taliyah or Twisted Fate.  The thing with assassins now is that there compared to the amount of champions overall, very few are assassins.  Also, most assassins at the moment are either really broken or always banned, or just garbage all together.  I think some balances with people like Zed or maybe even Akali and some buffs to some of the weaker ones could help fix this.  Also, some of the assassins are just old and deserve a rework.

At this point I don't really enjoy any of the new champions or the reworks. I've been basically reduced to playing Shaco every game, but I do fear that he will be reworked into something I dislike as well.\n\nWhat I do enjoy:\n\n1. No skillshots. I like point and click spells. But it can't be all melee/AA point and click. I want range point and click spells.\n\n2. I like strong to very strong early games and am more than willing to give up late game power for it. I especially like full on lane bullies.\n\n3. I like my champions to have strategic depth, but not mechanical depth.\n\n4. Something I appreciate, but is not required is a wide variety of builds such as how Shaco can go Tank, AD or AP and be effective in each one.\n\n5. I enjoy dealing damage more than taking it (i.e. not the biggest fan of tanks).\n\nEdit: 6. I forget one. No mini games. They are almost tedious and not fun.\n\nAlso past champions that I really enjoyed playing but the reworks ruined them for me: Gragas, Poppy, AP Yi, Zilean, Taric (when I needed to play Support), Garen, Veigar, Shen, and Mordekaiser.","replies":[{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2016-06-07T20:53:07.870+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pantheon is perfect for you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Abyssphere","date":"2016-06-07T21:37:31.054+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just curious - what is it about targeted abilities that you fixate on so much, and why the fondness for extreme early power even if it leads to huge problems later into the game?

Most of the heroes there are mechanically simple once you've adapted to their lengthy attack, cast, and turn animations in comparison to League, yet there's a whole lot of strategy in hero choices, skill usage, and item builds. Not to mention, most abilities don't have proper stat scaling ( they recently added universal scaling to all abilities, but it's overall pretty minor compared to what you get in League ) and instead scale really hard with levels - of which basic abilities only have four of, so you cap them out even faster than you do in League.\n\nMain thing I think you wouldn't like is the fact that the high mana costs to mana pool ratio means you have to be very precise when bullying your lane opponent, but there's ways to mitigate that anyway.","replies":[{"poster":"bistroh","date":"2016-06-07T21:19:37.017+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just dislike Dota 2's gameplay as a whole (not to mention the graphics)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Jorencice","date":"2016-06-07T20:48:55.058+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Except garen rework made him better in all the ways you want....\n\nThe only thing he lost is his ap build.","replies":[{"poster":"Guardman","date":"2016-06-07T21:13:57.570+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Jorencice,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=jRm084AB,comment-id=000800020000,timestamp=2016-06-07T20:48:55.058+0000)\n>\n> Except garen rework made him better in all the ways you want....\n> \n> The only thing he lost is his ap build.\n\nHe lost most of his early game bullying power for late game power.

It&#x27;s possible people might be able to help you identify some champs that could resonate with you after you put a bit of time into them if they can understand what you&#x27;re drawn to.\n\nThough I am a bit baffled that one can continue to play the game and not enjoy any of the champions, I partially understand the sentiments of this player.\n\nI play very few champions. I tried a bunch, but have not had fun  playing most of them. \n\nMy champion pool has expanded a bit, but there are only a handful of champions I really enjoy playing. Still, that handful is enough to get me to continue to play the game and have a very enjoyable experience. \n\nIf I didn't find {{champion:75}} last summer when I began playing I probably would have stopped playing completely. This may however, be due to how expensive some champions are and sometimes you need a lot of time to play a champion before you can determine if you enjoy playing that champion or that role (they are two completely separate concepts).\n\nWhen I was a new player, I played a lot of {{champion:98}} and {{champion:19}} and got quite bored playing both.  I only learned Shen because when I was learning how to play with my friends they thought that I could still have a lot of utility with my ultimate regardless, how hard I lost lane. This basically turned me into an \"ult bot\" and actually led to a lot of boring games for me.\n\nI also purchased some champions that I thought I would enjoy and surprise I didn't have any fun playing them. So I burned IP buying champions I didn't have any fun playing. It would be nice that you are pre-level 30 you could return a champion for IP after so many days or games played for a refund. One of my friends even purchased me {{champion:14}} to try because I didn't have IP and was getting bored with my limited champion pool.\n\nSomething I learned later is that role matters a lot too. I was put in the top lane when I started playing because I wanted to play a tank, but over time after playing other roles I realized I don't like specific ones at all. I do not have much fun playing ADC or in the mid lane. I like focusing on farming without distractions OR not focusing on farm at all. There is too much activity in the mid-lane and as an ADC their is a lot going on in the bottom lane. \n\nI now know that I prefer farm dependent champions (in the jungle or top) or playing supports, but arriving at those preferences was a bit of a grind. If it was not for the encouragement of most of my friends who played, I probably would have completely abandoned league.\n\nI think Riot could do a few things to lower entry barriers for newer players.\n1. Offer an IP refund option for early champion purchases\n2. A \"Champion Recommendation\" tab - some type of metric that gauges newer players and their preferences and later makes a recommendation to them. If Riot offered that player a trial week of that champion that would be really cool.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cubíx","date":"2016-06-07T20:04:59.609+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm not the OP but I've been looking for new junglers to play, maybe you could recommend some?\nI mostly play Kha'zix, ekko, a few tanks aswell\nI've gotten to the point where I want to find new junglers but Nothing really piques my interest.","replies":[{"poster":"Elewd","date":"2016-06-08T05:09:28.798+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"since you like Kha'zix/ekko.\nhave you tried Diana jungle? shes actually a lot of fun to play and has a surprising amount of versatility in how she builds, tanky? ok.
