Now that may sound a bit untrue to some people who main her, are high enough rank that they don&#039;t really notice, or they see a lot of players who see her potential and use her, however to someone who recently got to silver this is very obvious. Especially in Normal non-ranked games Poppy is rarely played if ever. I think that one of the main things about this is her character design. I mean just look at it {{champion:78}} . A lot of newer players don&#039;t buy champions based off of their kit but off of their visual appearance. For someone like Jinx, Echo, and the like this is easy, but for someone like Poppy who hasn&#039;t had a visual update in months or years, almost no new people buy her, even if she&#039;s only 450ip. As you may well know most people main one of the first champions that they buy when they&#039;re below level 10. This makes it hard for many people to be introduced to Poppy. I&#039;m not saying this just for people who might want to play her, I&#039;m also saying it for people who might have to go against Poppy that would never want to try her kit. I don&#039;t mean to offend anyone by saying that they can&#039;t deal with facing champs you don&#039;t know. What i&#039;m saying is that it would be a lot easier if you already knew what to do beforehand. This is why I am suggesting to Riot to give Poppy a visual update to allow newer players to see her potential. Please consider doing this update as I think it would help a lot","replies":[{"poster":"IronStylus","date":"2015-07-18T23:20:41.113+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":2,"body":"Well, so good news and bad news:\n\nGood news: Poppy will get a visual update. She's in the same camp as Sion, Taric, Urgot, etc which will recieve complete overhauls which will not only increase fidelity and introduce a newer and cleaner design, but also will aid in clarify and mechanical expression. We did a lot exploration on Poppy and are happy with what we've got. She's currently in the art production pipeline as her kit has been locked for some time. Now it's a matter of time and the technical work of getting that new character to live in game.\n\n\"Bad\" news: Poppy is shipping with a complete kit overhaul which will retain the spirit of Poppy, and utilize some signature abilities, but will probably vary pretty significantly than current Poppy. Think of the same way which we wanted to retain the \"feeling\" of Sion while keeping virtually nothing of his existing kit. I'e played her, and she's really, really fun. I think players old and new will find a home with her. I think that's what's going to bring her into a place where she'll be loved by passionate players but also new players alike. \n\nSo shipping the visual update probably isn't going to turn people onto existing, present-day Poppy as much as it will excite people to try what is fundamentally a brand new character which takes what we love about Poppy, amplifies it, and makes her more cohesive. Our goal on ChampUP is to excite enthusiasts, to get at what the real and visceral emotional attachments that bind them to a character and hone them, making that feeling more clear, maybe even stronger. Often that means pretty substantial change, for multiple reasons. Unique identity, clear role and play pattern, character/kit/art cohesion, among other things.  A sub-goal is to bring that character up so at the very least new players are aware of the character and can approach it comfortably. To bring that champion back into some rotation even if it's with a smaller but dedicated slice of players.\n\nThe team is very excited about Poppy. I'm happy to have been part of her development and can't wait for people to get a hold of this take on her.

Poppy is a beast and nothing needs to be done with her other than bringing her skins back. She only has two available and they aren't even her best skins so it makes her less appealing as a champ to play. drop her ult time by 2 second and buff her base stats. that's really all you need to do.

I mean Gangplank is mostly the same, only his E is very different gameplay-wise and Miss Fortune just got a couple of tweaks that could have taken 5 minutes to decide on. Poppy's a total overhaul though, so even if announced first it's not surprising she'd be released later.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Shénzhì","date":"2015-07-18T10:50:37.356+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Give her Gnar's raging and Tristana's rocketry and everything is explained.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Puri Puri Taric","date":"2015-07-16T09:08:18.395+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"this is how she gonna look like after because she is poopy the iron poobassador\nhttp://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--2ed8zSFC--/c_fit,fl_progressive,q_80,w_636/rxluh2jhqynpfbult7ea.jpg","replies":[]}]}
