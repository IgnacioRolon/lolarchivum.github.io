In my eyes it doesnt seem like its that difficult realising that something is op then nerfing it. Dont get me wrong, im sure the balance changes in terms of numbers is confusing and challenging to deal with but when it comes to certain mechanics surely it should be a quick fix. For example, at this point in time Kha&#039;Zix is pretty overpowered. What i would do is revert the q evolution to how it was in season 6 and then see how things play out. But then again thats me.","replies":[{"poster":"Meep Man","date":"2017-02-05T02:25:16.500+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Incredibly hard.

Nerf or buff an item/mastery and everyone that builds it, and everyone that it counters, are directly affected.","replies":[{"poster":"WoonStruck","date":"2017-02-05T02:24:19.243+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Meanwhile Riot goes and completely fucks up balance on a yearly/semi-yearly basis with preseason/midseason changes. \n\nHard to claim that actually balancing the game would be hard when Riot intentionally fucks it up constantly. \n\nDon't see that kind of stuff happening in other MOBAs, many of which are more complicated than LoL.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-02-05T02:35:09.068+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I get the feeling riot has conflicts of interest within the balance department, or between them and esports.\n\nThey try to rebalance to improve game health without properly testing all the collateral damage and without giving enough time for feedback and meta development.","replies":[{"poster":"WoonStruck","date":"2017-02-05T02:49:06.350+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pretty much this. \n\nThey never give time for meta development anymore.
