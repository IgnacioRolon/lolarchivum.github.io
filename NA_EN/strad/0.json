Kills turrets fast - for obvious reasons. Trynd gets free AD from Q, sometimes I tank turret for a few shots just to drop my hp down to half for that purpose. He also builds a lot of AS/AD later on.\n\n2. Strong duelist - If you have to run as soon as they send 1 measly support at you, you are useless as a splitpusher. You want them to send their strongest people, and still be able to kill them, which means they need to 2v1 or 3v1 you, leaving your team of 4 free to do something else.\n\n3. Slippery: In the event where the enemy sends a whole bunch of guys to take you down, it's a waste of manpower on their end, which can be good enough already. Still, it's even more insulting when they send 5 people to corner you and still fail to kill you, while your team gets bot inhib. E and R is a survival kit built for this.\n\n4. Weak teamfighter - Usually one of the weaknesses of splitpushers. Either they hate CC, or get bursted down without doing anything, and have no utility to offer the team, so he's better off splitpushing than joining up anyway.\n\nTrynd fits all the bill perfectly. I wouldn't say he's the best but his strengths in #1-3 are quite high up there among the top laners, and his weakness in #4 further cements his identity as a champ who doesn't like to group up but prefers to play PvE for turrets and minions (and maybe dragons/barons).","replies":[{"poster":"Tis a nice day","date":"2016-11-21T09:58:29.003+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Very clear and informative answer.

But now you do about a third the damage if there aren't ally minions. \n\nNow he's more like A splitpushing champion, with a lot of competition who are just as good and other strengths besides only that.","replies":[{"poster":"Darkwind","date":"2016-11-21T08:33:17.150+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"That's highly inaccurate.\n\n**Patch 5.22**\n* Turrets gain 300 ⇒ 200 armor and magic resist if no minions are nearby\n\nThis is the only change to backdoor mechanics during preseason 6. As you can see, this is actually a psuedo-nerf to their tankiness under backdoor situations. It isn't *really*, because the 300 AR/MR included the base AR/MR, and the turrets were given +500 HP and up to 30 AR/MR, scaling with time. So late game it's 300 ⇒ 230 AR/MR and 3500 ⇒ 4000 HP, which about evens out.\n\n**Patch 4.20**\n* Turret Reinforced Armor bonuses have been increased to +200 armor / magic resistance.\n\nThis change did actually increase the amount of the backdoor bonus... but it was even out by a nearly opposite change. Before this, towers gained AR/MR per level, and after it, they didn't. Furthermore, inhib turret HP/5 was nerfed, and Turret HP was also nerfed. All-in-all, neutral to positive for backdoor champs.\n\nBeyond this, Tryndamere isn't good at splitpushing because he's good at killing towers. He's good at splitpushing because he's good at killing a lone person (or even 2) that are trying to defend the tower and getting out. His E allows him to easily escape dangerous situations, and his damage+R lets him 2v1 in a lot of scenario.\n\nTLDR: backdoor hasn't been nerfed in a damn long time. Not since, like, 3.5. Or maybe even V0.9.25.24, depending on your definition. Plus, this is almost completely irrelevant to Tryn, as there hasnt been a time in a LONG time when you could 1v1 towers as anyone but Xin Zhao.
