Like first of all riots balance team has shown that they are terrible at balancing champs like these so why even release this guy lol, and not to mention the nightmare hes gonna be in the future every single time they release a new champ they have to think about this guy, every new champ released welp gotta rebalance sylas because he can steal every persons ult, which btw is my main gripe with this guy like all champs kit power levels are balanced of their ult so they cant have too powerful a kit with a powerful ult or you have a kaisa situation which the ult shield is too much nerf that if you wanna nerf her not the dumb e atk speed nerf they did, which further proves riots balance team has no idea how to deal with these champs so why does sylas' kit have as much as it does like thats so bonkers he has a stun  a shield aoe medium dps in his passive burst execute burst heal and a slow which his q is meh but everything else about his kit is good and then you give him the ability to steal any ult from the enemy team to round it all up its just dumb and terribly designed lmao and riots team is not good enough to balance a champ like this just my 2 cents on this champ","replies":[{"poster":"Tr4shB4NSYST3M","date":"2019-09-16T21:45:27.368+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The thing about sylas is he has a strong kit before you even factor in the ult.  2 part aoe Q w/ slow, Waveclear autos on passive, W is basically illaoi W but with a heal if sylas is low, and E is riven E for magic damage AND a free amumu Q added in.  \n\nSo before you even get to the ult his kit is very strong, then you throw in his MEME of an ult, that was JOKED ABOUT BEFORE BUT NEVER REALLY THOUGHT ABOUT SERIOUSLY BECAUSE EVERYONE KNEW THAT STEALING ULTS WOULD BE DISGUSTINGLY OP.\n\nBut IMO riot is just gonna keep making disgustingly overloaded champs like sylas pyke and quiyana because flashy champs like this keep their dying game afloat, for every 5 people that hate it there will be 5 that say \"WHAAOW SO KEWL\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-09-16T23:26:31.267+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://images-wixmp-ed30a86b8c4ca887773594c2.wixmp.com/f/a5220c6a-fd1e-48f3-8a22-cbe15ed21d0f/d7w1dbf-4485a08a-94de-4165-870b-b16b83ef4d40.jpg?token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJ1cm46YXBwOjdlMGQxODg5ODIyNjQzNzNhNWYwZDQxNWVhMGQyNmUwIiwiaXNzIjoidXJuOmFwcDo3ZTBkMTg4OTgyMjY0MzczYTVmMGQ0MTVlYTBkMjZlMCIsIm9iaiI6W1t7InBhdGgiOiJcL2ZcL2E1MjIwYzZhLWZkMWUtNDhmMy04YTIyLWNiZTE1ZWQyMWQwZlwvZDd3MWRiZi00NDg1YTA4YS05NGRlLTQxNjUtODcwYi1iMTZiODNlZjRkNDAuanBnIn1dXSwiYXVkIjpbInVybjpzZXJ2aWNlOmZpbGUuZG93bmxvYWQiXX0.7S6odjr84o0jEeaW8dT4FPMNlZi0AwuHkYVSmuI0TXs","replies":[]},{"poster":"Karn Bishop","date":"2019-09-17T03:45:23.406+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Their only mistake is their insistence that he be a laner who is anti mage, just make him what he naturally wants to be which is a mage jungler.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Saezio","date":"2019-09-16T21:49:45.334+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"I mean, sure if you are masters or above Sylas is hella strong.
