There's more players and the game matches you, there's nobody to say \"OH fuck that I don't want AeroWaffle playing Nami jg in my game\". If there were more playing in TB it would slightly help but TB let's them see you. If you queue with me I have no clue what you're gonna play. I've put support as my secondary and gotten my primary a healthy amount of times.
