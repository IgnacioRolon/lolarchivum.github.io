Is there ever a reason to not take duskblade on any ad caster ? Im kind of tired of champions that are overpowered because they can proc duskblade twice. I feel like its kind of silly that assassin rework happened to give more counterplay and yet this iteam by itself removes any counterplay. Here are my suggestions, i would be happy if even one came to fruition:\r\n\r\n- Remove ward detection\r\nIts ridiculous that good duskblade user cant be caught in a warded brush because he reveals the ward and if its on cooldown its easy to see that proc duration goes down = its warded. \r\n\r\n- Remove proc buff when damage is taken\r\nAssasins should be all about surprise and getting first hit, champions shouldnt be able to just run straight  in clear vision on their target and get away with it.\r\n\r\n- Add diminishing returns on multiple procs\r\nSo you can stop nerfing  {{champion:121}} {{champion:141}}  the abusers instead.\r\n\r\n\r\nIm honestly very frustrated with this iteam i dont know if i will open any discussion but this post really helped me vent my frustration with this game right now.","replies":[{"poster":"Śhunpo","date":"2018-02-10T16:42:55.875+0000","up_votes":68,"down_votes":2,"body":"Nerf Duskblade and buff the AD assassins who are using it as a crutch for their strength.

Even tought I hated the old LB, this new one isn't that better.\n\nHer laning phase it's the same thing to the enemy. She still has her insane poke and safety that she had pre-rework. the difference it's that she just takes 1.5s more to do it, wich in the laning phase isn't a big deal.\nShe became also more unpredictable with her R, wich, once again, makes sometimes extremly hard to punish her because she has always at least one dash up. Old LB only could Re-cast the last spell she used. \nAlso, her late game wich pre-work we need to agree was a bit abnoxious, she now is useless. The time she takes to assassinate the target it's just too much. While she's waiting for the passive to proc, the enemy ADC will monstly be able to kill her.\nSo basicly:\n- It didn't fix any of the issues she had in the laning phase, she still has the same laning phase, basicly, and also she is less predictable because her R is different now;\n- Her late game is god awful because the targets she's supposed to kill are actually killing her instead.\n\nNow talking about Fizz, I used to main Fizz back then, but not anymore. Fizz suffered the same as the LB: Delay. His ulti is completly useless if you hit from short range, because it will do less damage and the AoE is pathetic.\nHis burst is dependent on his W nowdays, wich he has to wait 2 seconds.\nThe rework overall was just a nerf to his damage. His core abilities and how he works didn't change at all. The only thing they did was add delay to his burst and make his ultimate dealing damage when landed from long range. I used to love play him, and I admit he was kinda abnoxious, but this is just stupid because nowdays Fizz is a shadow of his former himself.\n\nKatarina rework was actually the only one I liked, because she now isn't the same braindead she used to be, but she actually is overturned in my opinion. I won't dicuss any further about her because my opinion is a bit biased.\n\nI could be here talking about the other assassins, but I think you got the idea:\nThey basicly, in most of the cases, just add delay to assassins kits and nothing else, when they saw they had a big lack of damage, they introduced duskblade and the AP assassins started to build items as gunblade and protobelt.","replies":[{"poster":"Arakadia","date":"2018-02-11T16:00:51.660+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"I actually originally meant that outside of a few examples like Leblanc there was some success in the Assassin Rework. \n\nI agree that new Leblanc has a whole bunch of issues still. \n\nHowever it doesn't seem to me that you understand why they did these changes.\n\n> Now talking about Fizz, I used to main Fizz back then, but not anymore. Fizz suffered the same as the LB: Delay. \n\nThe delays were needed. They might not have been executed or implemented successfully but having some form of a delay was really needed. \n\n> His ulti is completly useless if you hit from short range, because it will do less damage and the AoE is pathetic.\n\nThat's a good thing! Old Fizz could ult you in melee range and there is very little chance of you dodging it. New Fizz is extremely encouraged to get longer ranged ultimate so his enemies actually have a good chance of dodging the spell. At the same time, a max ranged Fizz ult can be even more effective than old Fizz ult. \n\n> His burst is dependent on his W nowdays, wich he has to wait 2 seconds.\nThe rework overall was just a nerf to his damage\n\nThis I disagree with.\n\nThe rework did not lower his damage. It lowered his reliability. In fact I think most assassins got more _potential_ damage in the rework. But they became more reliant on accessing this potential damage. So while old Fizz maybe dealt 50 damage in his whole rotation, new Fizz could deal 40 if played poorly or even 60 if played correctly. This variance is probably what makes Fizz feel like his damage was lowered. \n\n> I used to love play him, and I admit he was kinda abnoxious, but this is just stupid because nowdays Fizz is a shadow of his former himself.\n\nUpdating Leblanc and Fizz is difficult because many LB and Fizz players like the champion for the reasons they are poorly designed. One of your issues with the Fizz rework is you can no longer ult in very close range, which was one of the big issues with old Fizz. \n\nAs a result, its hard to improve the champion's design without removing what the players liked. \n\n> I could be here talking about the other assassins, but I think you got the idea:\nThey basicly, in most of the cases, just add delay to assassins kits and nothing else, when they saw they had a big lack of damage, they introduced duskblade and the AP assassins started to build items as gunblade and protobelt.\n\nI agree that assassin shouldn't rely on overtuned items to be successful. I think AP Assassins need some more itemization. I also think that not all the delays added in the assassins rework were successfully implemented and a lot of them made playing the champion feel worse (which is a bad thing).","replies":[{"poster":"ChaddyFantome","date":"2018-02-11T17:16:07.307+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Arakadia,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=txYtQ0UI,comment-id=0001000100010000,timestamp=2018-02-11T16:00:51.660+0000)\n>Updating Leblanc and Fizz is difficult because many LB and Fizz players like the champion for the reasons they are poorly designed. \n\nQuote for truth.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Pommel Knight","date":"2018-02-10T20:10:53.042+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":3,"body":"Fizz ult change is the worst thing ever.
