He also has his standard taunts and jokes, but whenever I use his taunt in the proximity of an enemy champ that I know he has a specialized taunt for, he just says his standard phrase instead, for instance, &quot;Nocturne spooky&quot;. I am not sure if this is intentional or a bug, but it bothers me that a feature of his legendary skin isn&#039;t working properly. Any help would be very appreciated. :)","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-08-04T18:42:54.118+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hiya HeavensReaper, \n\nI was able to trigger the taunt against en enemy Nocturne by using /taunt.
