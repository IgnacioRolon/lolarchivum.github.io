Your MMR has to be pretty low to be demoted out of a tier (at least the MMR of a normal player of the tier below yours - so Bronze V).  You should be able to tell if you're close to that on your Summoner profile.  \n\nA notification like this should pop up if you're close to being demoted: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204010760-Ranked-Play-FAQ#h6q2","replies":[{"poster":"Lucifer","date":"2015-10-13T01:01:28.524+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is this currently broken?

It can be fairly easy to miss, especially if you don't visit your Summoner profile after every game.

I can say that for me personally it would put a ton more pressure if every time I lost a game I got a pop up notification telling me I COULD be demoted if I don't start winning.  Most people try to win, so giving them a pop up telling them they need to win seems redundant.  The warning is more there for people who WANT to check if they're close to being demoted.\n\n2) For divisions there is no notice because every time you lose a game at 0 LP you run the risk of demotion.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kosm1K","date":"2015-10-15T08:25:13.203+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Big question here, does this occur for every time you're gonna go through a big demotion only when you're \"shielded\" like the link you posted said?

After some wins and losses in gold V I ended up at 0 LP and kept checking my summoner profile for the warning after every loss at zero LP (did not want to risk dropping a tier so close to season end). No warning did ever show, and I did drop back to Silver I eventually.\n\nI filed a support ticket for this, as it seemed to me that the warning system was broken. I had a nice chat with support and this was one of the replies: \n\n> I apologize for any misunderstandings regarding demotion. The alert will only trigger if you're currently being shielded. Demotions are based on your LP and are influenced by your MMR. If your MMR is significantly lower than the average for the current tier or division, every time you lose a game at 0 LP, you run the risk of demotion.\n\nI.e. the warning apparently only shows when you are still being shielded. \n\nAnd answering my question on how to know if you are still being shielded or not:\n\n>Unfortunately, there is no way to know if the shield is still active or not. However, whether you win or lose, the shield will be used up on our next games after being promoted. After it has been used up, then you're at risk of dropping every time you lose a game at 0 LP\n\nTL;DR: the shield after promoting a tier is a \"consumable\", it decreases every game, whether you win or lose. After the shield has been used up, there's no warning when you are about to drop a tier. So: summoner beware! :)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"MysticFlameHaze","date":"2015-10-13T16:47:19.792+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I also think this is broken, I've have never once seen this when i got demoted not to long ago.
