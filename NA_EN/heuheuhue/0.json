It only says scroll, but hey, what to scroll when you cannot magnify them, as I&#039;m running a relatively high resolution, and i&#039;ve tried to use the zoom feature of the browser, but guess what, it maximizes the layout so that the page of the comic stays centered anyway. \r\nOnly one solution I found was to open each page as an individual picture, and zoom in and out however I like, but doing this for every page... it&#039;s annoying.","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2018-12-28T17:35:37.507+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lots of folks recomending the mobile version, but I understand you want to see it bigger on your monitor.

I don't mean to sound harsh, but why is that necessary for a slideshow? Not even a slideshow; an image viewer. Those have been popular on the Internet for a long time and are basically a solved problem. You (meaning the comics team web developer, not you specifically) could... do that. Just take it down a notch from this monstrosity that takes control away from the user and use something simpler. I've been using Highslide.js on my website's image gallery for the last ten years, and it looks fine and works with browser zoom. Even the custom slideshow I wrote for my sister's wedding a few months ago with a wide variety of CSS transitions supports zooming. But this doesn't even need that - you could just slap a centered table onto the page to hold the image and the forward/back links.\n\nI mean, yeah, \"don't you have phones\", I get it, but... really now.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"The Iceborn","date":"2018-12-28T14:59:55.567+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I read my comic on comicology on my phone and I was absolutely able to zoom in so try the phone","replies":[{"poster":"WAAARGHbobo","date":"2018-12-28T22:10:49.207+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Comixology has panel view and better zoom tech we don’t have.
