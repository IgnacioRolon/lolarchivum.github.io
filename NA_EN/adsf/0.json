It's really ironic that people focus on KDA when they complain about scoring when trying to get people away from the KDA mindset was what Riot intended to accomplish with the scoring system in the first place.","replies":[{"poster":"Adsf","date":"2016-11-20T13:32:38.510+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But im not even complaining i just think its funny and yes form my pov he did participate very well in the game but maybe your right about focusing only on K.D.A","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sona Ping","date":"2016-11-20T12:49:39.066+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why?
