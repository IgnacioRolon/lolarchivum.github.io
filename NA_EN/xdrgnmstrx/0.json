Relatively new, 6GB graphics card, latest gen processor, SSD, 16 gb RAM, etc. etc.\n\nWhen I run League of Legends on my laptop screen, I have no problems at all.  When I connect via HDMI to my external monitor (its actually a Vizio 4K TV) I can't seem to get the game client to load.  I've tried changing the resolution via windows to all possible settings (including 1080p), and I've even tried adjusting the resolution in the CFG file, without any luck.\n\nOne glimmer of hope is that I was able to close the game, login again, and click reconnect and was able to join the game, but this certainly isn't a viable long term solution.  It does prove that its working however.  I also updated my DirectX, DotNetFramework, and graphics card drivers, which didn't solve the problem.\n\nAny suggestions on how to fix this problem?\n\nP.S. My other PC has no problem running two monitors and LoL, but its a windows 7 machine.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-21T23:17:00.468+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"4K is not currently supported, so you may see issues like this such as black screens or a wonky resolution.  Your best bet would be to use a smaller screen, if you are able to use the monitor for other things just fine.  If not, there could be an issue with the cable or a hardware problem, and swapping it with another can rule out some possibilities.  Hope that helps clear things up!","replies":[]},{"poster":"xDrgnMstrx","date":"2016-09-21T23:04:56.217+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Forgot to mention, I was also able to get the game to run in Windowed mode by changing that setting in the CFG file.  Really frustrating though.","replies":[]}]}
