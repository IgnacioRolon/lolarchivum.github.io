There is a secondary work around that might be able to help:\n\nLog in to League of Legends\nBrowse to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config and open \"Game.cfg\" in notepad or any other text editor\nFind this line: WindowMode=X\nChange the \"X\" to 2. IE: WindowMode=2\nSave this, then launch a custom game\n\nI suggest testing it out in a custom game to prevent any penalties.
