It is possible for a single person to solo carry out of Bronze. I myself have had some success carrying myself out of B5 all the way to B2 promos by cleaning up some aspects of my own play. I learned to cs, better, focused more on pushing than trying to pad my KDA, learned to trade better in lane and it really helped. \n\nDon't get me wrong. There are a many games that are simply uncarriable for the slightly above average Bronze player and even then those games are carriable too, just not by us.\n\nLook at this guy:-\nhttp://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=dragonsoysauce\n\nA couple weeks ago he played Sivir on the enemy team and he just straight up fuckin wrecked us. I swear this dude carried the entire game by himself. He played so goddamn good that even if two of his team mates went AFK we would have still lost. That's how fuckin good he was. His team barely even mattered. I felt like me and my team were beginner AIs just waiting to feed this guy. We just could not stop his relentless assault.\n\nThe problem though, is that most of us will never be that good. But, I've seen that it certainly is possible to be so good that no bullshit your team does can jeopardize your victory.","replies":[{"poster":"MonkeyMadness","date":"2016-06-20T21:09:49.523+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"I agree with you, this low elo \"my team causes me to lose\" attitude is just so bad.

I think this is why so many people complain. Just a while back today I decided I'm giving up on trying. I'm just gonna play for playing sake and do whatever the hell. It's just way too stressful. I really put a lot of effort into it and despite how many people say its easy to get out, my best effort only got me to B2 promos and that's after hitting B4 and dropping back down to B5 0 LP no less than 10 times this season.\n\nI know its my own fault that I can't get out but I think I got caught up in all the \"oh Bronze so easy, just do this and that and you'll get out easy\". I've only just realized that in reality it takes a tonne of practice and research, watching videos and streams, just a fuck tonne of effort and frankly, I'm exhausted. I have a life and I really cannot devote all this effort to become that good at a video game. I've made up my mind that when I inevitably fall back to B5 0 LP, I'm done with ranked. I'm just gonna play casual and just have fun. \n\nI think a lot of people complaining about how hard it is to climb should do the same. The effort you have to put in is far more that people realize and unless you're prepared to devote 8 hrs a day playing this, you shouldn't be aiming to climb.","replies":[{"poster":"MonkeyMadness","date":"2016-06-20T23:06:57.167+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I never said it was easy to get out of bronze, and honestly whenever someone tells me that this game is easy, I seriously want to punch them in the mouth.

I'm not saying it's not doable. What I'm saying is that the effort required is enormous. When high elo people are always ragging on about how Bronze is easy and how bad Bronze is, it gives the impression that's it's relatively easy to get out. Based on my own rate of improvement, I'd say even getting to Silver is an amazing feat of determination. While yes, Silver is low elo, anyone who makes it there has my respect. It takes real effort and not 2 hours on a weekend kind of effort. I can only imagine what it takes to get to Diamond. You'd have to live, sleep and shit this game to get that good.\n\nThing is most people think they can just spam a couple games now and again, watch a couple streams and that's enough.

Recently, I finally managed to make it to B2 promos which I lost and I'm currently falling right back down again. No doubt I'll once again be B5 0 LP by the next couple days. It is next to impossible to keep a positive attitude. This shit if seriously discouraging. Losing 7 games in a row makes me wonder if I learned anything at all or if almost reaching B2 is luck.

I doubt this tilt is lasting several days. To be honest, I really don't know why this happens. I'm thinking luck has some factor to play in this. Every time I climb, I do it on win streaks, most of which I'm carrying. When I start falling, it's usually due to a high amount of uncarriable games. My 1st few loses after losing B2 promos, had me getting teams that feed close to 15 kills in the space of 10 minutes. I have no idea how to carry these games, even if I play snowball champs. After that I start playing like shit, feeding and all that, the tilt you were talking about. I took a break, came back and 1st game after my break, another uncarriable game, followed by another. Pretty much gave up trying hard after that and just let the fall happen. I actually think it's better that I accept that I'll fall right back down because when I expect anything else and get disappointed, it gets me in a bad mood. \n\nEventually, I'll climb back up. I can get B4 pretty consistently now. B3 takes more effort and a little luck. Still working on B2.","replies":[{"poster":"Oldwisepotato","date":"2016-06-22T13:47:49.197+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"damn man I want to help you haha. Looks like your three main champs currently are {{champion:268}} {{champion:39}} {{champion:10}} all of whom I don't really play. Azir has a pretty high  skill cap and is op at like mid/low Diamond + but not until that skill cap. Kayle can carry if you know how to play her right. {{champion:39}}  can carry as well. \n\nYour csing looks to be pretty good in most games which is encouraging. However, it looks like you die a decent amount. So let me ask you. Do you just sit in lane and farm and push most of the game or do you roam at all? Ultimately csing and pushing lane are generally more important, but ganking lanes when your mid can help the team out a lot. Especially if you are running teleport. Also, with your average of 10-11 deaths a game in recent games it looks like you might be getting killed by ganks a lot? Or dying right away in team fights? You should work on your positioning so you can do damage in team fights, yet also stay alive. And make sure you have wards or try and keep track of where the enemy is so you don't get ganked and die as often. \n\nWhat I do when I am playing in bronze and trying to rank up is play a champ I am confident I can carry In. I then try my hardest to not only cs in lane, but win the lane by killing my opponent over & over. If the enemy is not a hard counter to me (even if they are a lot of the time) I am generally able to get some kills in lane while continuing to cs. I then look for opportunities to gank lanes to 1. help my allies, but 2. more importantly try and get myself more kills. Even though you can only rely on yourself to rank up, bronze is the lowest elo and the least likely elo where you can rely on your allies to help carry. You no doubt are going to probably have to carry some games 1v5. So its all about getting yourself or whoever is fed on your team as fed as possible. The good news is, besides smurfs most people in bronze are there for a reason. So its the easiest elo to get super fed and hard carry in. The more you learn the easier it is to carry in other elos as well. \n\nI know its hard to see the light without experiencing it, but its there. Its embarrassing how much I have played this game and seeing how bad I am. I had probably 400-500 normal wins before even playing ranked in season 2. My elo in season 2 was probably the equivalent of bronze 4. Then when season 3 came around and the system changed I was put in bronze 4. I was pissed, but knew I had to work to rank up. Not sure why but I decided to play adc. I mained {{champion:110}} adc in season 3, which pretty much got me out of bronze. I laugh really hard about it now because I never play him anymore and I look back at my season 3 stats and see how terrible they are. Then in season 4 I got up to silver 2 and could not figure out why I could not get past it. Took literally over a year of grinding silver until roughly the end of season 5 before I realized silver 2 was my actual current elo. I finally realized I just needed to improve to start to rank up. It really did not take long to improve enough to reach gold after realizing that. Now I realize I will stick around gold 4-5 unless I continue to improve. \n\nThe good news is there is lots of things to improve on. Start with the basics and work your way up. Focus on winning your lane hard, but play safe if you fall behind. Focus on trying to catch enemies with ganks and try to snowball the game. Work on your team fight positioning. Warding and paying attention to your mini map is also important.","replies":[{"poster":"FioraWillCarry","date":"2016-06-23T17:13:27.715+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Oldwisepotato,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Ba7QEsbE,comment-id=000600000001000200000000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2016-06-22T13:47:49.197+0000)\n>\n> What I do when I am playing in bronze and trying to rank up is play a champ I am confident I can carry In.

I think it was called freezing to Diamond or something like that. He talk about freezing lane. Now, I've watched a lot of these kinds of videos so I know what freezing is, hell I've done it. But I didn't really get it. I knew what it was and how to do it sure but I never really grasped its power. I just thought it was some cutesy thing you can do to frustrate your opponent or make a hard lane easier. This specific video mentioned how it can be used to get fed. I didn't really make the connection.\n\nJust played a game and decided for the hell of it, I'll just freeze the fuck out of the lane. I was Azir going up against a Syndra. The result ? I shit on that Syndra. Killed her something like 3 times within the space of 5 minutes. Because of the freeze, she had to come close my tower to cs and I'd just shuffle her into my tower, and ignite or auto attack her to death. Worked so beautifully. \n\nNow I'm probably gonna try it again and I may very well get wrecked this time. I've had similar breakthroughs before that seemed to work for a while and then it stops working. I don't expect I'll start steamrolling now, but I know something I didn't yesterday. And with some practice, I have yet another thing I can abuse to win in Bronze.\n\nJust wanted to let you know since you touched on this in our discussion.","replies":[{"poster":"FioraWillCarry","date":"2016-06-24T14:55:14.264+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Oldwisepotato,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Ba7QEsbE,comment-id=00060000000100020000000000000000000000000000000000010000,timestamp=2016-06-24T13:48:43.802+0000)\n>\n> Nice there you go!

Since that 1st game, I used it for every game afterwards, went on a 7 game win streak. Got from B4 0LP to B3 with almost no losses. I did it using Kayle top exclusively. 80% of players in Bronze really don't know what do when they are freezed out. I was able to zone them from csing and later, outright kill them or force a back every time they attempt to cs. \n\nThe only problem I have to solve now is freezing opponents who can out trade me. I had problems with Nasus and Olaf due to the fact that they can build MR items first while doing insane damage early game. When I freezed on them and poked them when they tried to farm, they would trade and win almost every time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Oldwisepotato","date":"2016-06-24T13:48:43.802+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nice there you go!

I have an affinity for sustain damage champs which I why I play Kayle and Azir alot. I like Irelia because she can build super tanky and still deal massive amounts of burst. Plus she's like sleeper OP, ie, nobody bans her and she's not a contested pick. However, it's a coin toss with Irelia. With Azir and Kayle, there are hardly any lanes that present a problem. They can cs insanely well and I love love love their waveclear.\n\n > Your csing looks to be pretty good in most games which is encouraging. However, it looks like you die a decent amount. So let me ask you. Do you just sit in lane and farm and push most of the game or do you roam at all? Ultimately csing and pushing lane are generally more important, but ganking lanes when your mid can help the team out a lot. Especially if you are running teleport. \n\nRoaming is a tricky thing. If I'm against a strong pusher like Yasuo, roaming is out of the question. He shoves too fast so I'm pretty much always pinned against my tower. Using roams in more favorable matchups, mostly to prevent feeds at bot lane which happens in 95% of Bronze games, I discovered that it is detrimental if your roams yield nothing. Meaning, you MUST get a tower, a kill, something otherwise you fall behind. Last few games I just stopped roaming all together because its too unreliable. I try to stay in lane as push as hard as I can to get towers as fast as I can. Kayle top is incredibly good at this. Sometimes, I would do this until I'm near full build. It actually worked for a while. Got me to B2 promos then it stopped working. \n\n\n> Also, with your average of 10-11 deaths a game in recent games it looks like you might be getting killed by ganks a lot? \n\nActually, last 10 games or so I was really fuckin tilted. I was just playing very carelessly. Its easy for me if I want not to die at all. There was a recent game somewhere in my match list where my team fed super super super hard and I was 2-0. So I know how not to die. Most of my deaths come from jumping into fights my team starts that I know we'd probably lose but still do in the mad hope that I can turn it around. Sometimes I can, sometimes I cannot. I really don't know what to do sometimes when my team goes in for a fight that is unfavorable. 95% of my deaths come from this.\n\nHere's an example. Say I'm top on the red side and I see my jungler following the low HP mid laner after a skirmish. And he is running from mid to top. Now I'm fighting with the enemy top laner and my jungler is pinging for help. This is a bad fight because to start because 90% of the time we do not know where the enemy jungler is. But what can I do ? Leave him to die ? I will intercept the fleeing enemy. Their top would follow me, and when the fight starts, the enemy jungler would come out of now where and now it's 3v2. The vast majority of my deaths come from situations like this. In my view, no one should ever chase someone into unwarded territory yet I keep getting dragged into fights with no vision trying to cover my team mate's stupid decisions and often end up paying for it with my life. In this example, the correct thing would be for my jungler to break off pursuit. Thirst is the number 1 reason for feed fests in Bronze.  \n\n>Or dying right away in team fights? You should work on your positioning so you can do damage in team fights, yet also stay alive. And make sure you have wards or try and keep track of where the enemy is so you don&#x27;t get ganked and die as often. \n\nI try to do that as much as I can. I have a lot of trouble when the enemy team has either a strong engage, think Gnar, Malphite, Maokai, Annie, Warwick, Amumu. Or when they have a lot of high damage divers. Think Fizz, Leblanc, Akali, Diana, Xin-Xiao. When they have more than one of either on the enemy team, I have a lot of problems with positioning. I often find myself being the only one who thinks about Malphite's ult or Fizz's E. I often don't know what to do other than wait for them to use their moves before going in. Problem is, you'll meet a lot of smart ones(usually on the enemy team of course) who hold on to their game changing abilities. And what happens usually, I'm forced to do little to nothing the entire time just waiting for Malphite to ult or for Fizz to use his E. My team dies many times during my wait and I'm left facing all of them by myself.\n\n Two divers is a real problem. I have to wait for not one, but two sets of cooldowns to be blown. I never know how to approach these fights especially when my team has no respect for their enemy's abilities. Often times I just say fuck it and go in mindlessly like the rest of my team and pray for some kind of fuck up on the enemy's team. Its a coin toss in other words. A lot of my deaths come from situations like this\n\n \n> What I do when I am playing in bronze and trying to rank up is play a champ I am confident I can carry In. I then try my hardest to not only cs in lane, but win the lane by killing my opponent over &amp; over. \n\nCan't tell you when last I was able to kill someone over and over again in a lane. I usually get 1 kill, maybe 2 and that's it. I have seen smurfs kill the enemy laner over and over again. Hell, I've had smurfs kill me over and over again in lane. I've been trying to figure out how they do this but I just can't figure it out. They just seem to be able to do this easily. \n\nAkali is the only champion I can get reliably fed on by abusing her powerful roams. Akali though is not really a reliable carry. Tanky teams fuck her up, she can't siege well, she can't splitpush all that good and her laning is among the weakest, ie, she gets bullied too easily in lane. She's only really good vs a team of squishy champs and she hasn't been bullied out of cs during the laning phase.\n\n> then look for opportunities to gank lanes to 1. help my allies, but 2. more importantly try and get myself more kills.\n\n Another thing I've seen smurfs do really well. Half the time I do it, I get nothing. A smurf roams in a Bronze game, bet your ass he's getting a double or tripple kill. I need to learn what it is they see that I can't that tells them they will get something. \n\nI look for over extended lanes when I want to roam but with me what usually happens is that I get fucked over by the time it takes to reach to the lane I'm ganking ganking. For example, say I'm mid and I see the enemy bot pushing up against my team's bot lane tower. I start walking to bot. By the time I reach, the lane has reset, and they have backed off. I just roamed for nothing. I don't know what I can do to improve my odds. \n\n> I know its hard to see the light without experiencing it, but its there. Its embarrassing how much I have played this game and seeing how bad I am. I had probably 400-500 normal wins before even playing ranked in season 2. My elo in season 2 was probably the equivalent of bronze 4. Then when season 3 came around and the system changed I was put in bronze 4. I was pissed, but knew I had to work to rank up. Not sure why but I decided to play adc. I mained {{champion:110}} adc in season 3, which pretty much got me out of bronze. I laugh really hard about it now because I never play him anymore and I look back at my season 3 stats and see how terrible they are. Then in season 4 I got up to silver 2 and could not figure out why I could not get past it. Took literally over a year of grinding silver until roughly the end of season 5 before I realized silver 2 was my actual current elo. I finally realized I just needed to improve to start to rank up. It really did not take long to improve enough to reach gold after realizing that. Now I realize I will stick around gold 4-5 unless I continue to improve. \n\nYa, I pretty much figured it would take a year to years to get out. I honestly thought it would have been easier given how people love to comment on how bad Bronze is. I'm discovering that it would take a lot more skill to get out than I originally thought.\n\n> The good news is there is lots of things to improve on. Start with the basics and work your way up. Focus on winning your lane hard, but play safe if you fall behind. Focus on trying to catch enemies with ganks and try to snowball the game. Work on your team fight positioning. Warding and paying attention to your mini map is also important.\n\nYa, still working on those.","replies":[{"poster":"FioraWillCarry","date":"2016-06-22T18:52:41.406+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Oldwisepotato,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Ba7QEsbE,comment-id=00060000000100020000000000000000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2016-06-22T18:19:12.450+0000)\n>\n> Yea it takes some getting used to. Generally what I do when playing mid is first I try to keep track of my lane opponent. Did I just kill them? Did they just back? Did they go in bottom bush and have not returned to lane? Top bush and not returned to lane? A lot of times this may indicate they are about to gank bot or top. You can ping whatever lane you think they are going to gank to try and warn them and follow if you feel you can help in a fight. Usually if you kill your lane opponent and still have health and mana and see bot lane is over extended, this could be a good time to gank. Or push mid turret. Whichever looks more promising. I guess the most important thing is trying to keep track of your lane and the enemy jungler. If you just saw the enemy jungler gank top and know your lane just backed, then ganking bot should not be too risky. I have been playing a lot of jungle lately and when junlging you have to get used to paying attention to the mini map. You want to try and see where the enemy jungler has been or is going so you can either gank a lane without worrying about getting counter ganked, or trying to counter gank the enemy. So the same thought process goes into when trying to roam as a mid laner. If you feel you can beat your lane opponent and think they are ganking bot, you can follow bot lane and counter gank and that&#x27;s usually when players pick up those double or triple kills you are referring to. I know sometimes I personally start heading bot without looking at run into the enemy jungler and that can lead to you dying so always have to be paying attention to your character. Really its all about learning how strong you are and keeping track of the enemy or at least keeping track of knowing what you know. Like if your lane opponent is missing for awhile, you might not know if they are heading bot or top but overtime you should start to become more confident in knowing if they are heading bot or top or if they just grabbing their blue buff. You also will learn to pay attention to the enemy jungler overtime which will help lead to counter ganking them  or at least avoiding their  ganks.\n\nThanks for the advice. Never really thought much about keeping track of the enemy jungler. I generally only pay attention to whether I know he is near me or not. I assume as a mid laner, its not a bad idea to ward the enemy jungle ? It's something I've never done as a mid laner, except maybe for an invade.

But, I&#x27;ve seen that it certainly is possible to be so good that no bullshit your team does can jeopardize your victory.\n\nThis is only partially true as I have found that it is a combination of luck and skill. Because if the enemy team has players just as good as you are, then you're going to lose. The fucked up match making system has a lot to do with this issue.  The only time I am legitimately able to outplay a whole team is when I am a fed Udyr, and I just dash behind the entire team, taunt the shit out of them, and run like hell to give my team a chance to start pushing, or use the distraction to allow them to land a hard engage.\n\nUnfortunately, if the enemy team has a brain stem they'll just send one person after you making whatever teamfights transpire into a 4v4. Seriously, I get it when people say it has to do with attitude, I've had games where i've legitimately fucked up, but that does not suddenly remove the responsibility of the rest of your team.  They could have taken advantage of the distraction, they could have bought a zz'rot portal and placed it in top lane so they could push in mid, while I myself split push bot. Did they? No, they did not, and that is _their_ fault. The same thing goes for if split-pushing isn't the solution, and a teamfight is, and you have one doofus incapable of figuring out that we can actually win in a 5v5 scenario, or is simply choosing to be a coward, whereas if that person did show up then we would have a legitimate shot at winning the game.\n\nEverybody has a part to play on a team, if one person fails to do their part, the whole team potentially **falls** apart. In every case where I see one person carrying the game, it's because those teammates eventually realize that if they do one that person tells them to do, follow his lead, and act like a fucking team then they will most likely win. \n\nTeamwork determines the outcome of this game, and yes it does take a good attitude to lead a team, but even then a good attitude is not enough to overcome the mentality of a stubborn brat wherein the only way to get him/her to listen is to slap them across the mouth and get them to listen to you out of fear, but there's possibly hundreds miles separating you from them. This is honestly why I'm looking forward to voice-chat. I've always had a better time getting a team to hold their shit together through voice chat, so much easier to get them to buckle up, and play their part.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MrPharmD","date":"2016-06-22T13:43:29.679+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even Lebron couldn't win last year when Irving when down.\n\nTeam > the best player any day.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2016-06-24T15:27:39.747+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe you can get stuck in Bronze2 is you have a Silver4 level.
