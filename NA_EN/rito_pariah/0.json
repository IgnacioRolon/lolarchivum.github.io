YOU can't change their behaviour but you can change yours, hence why yours is given for review, and only yours to keep the focus on what you can do to improve, rather than simply shifting the blame because they did something wrong too. Two wrongs don't make a right, just makes double the wrong.\n\n> And sadly, I bet riot didn't do anything to the people who were being so toxic and vile to me. \n\nWhat exactly makes you think this? In fact, if hate speech was involved, it's grounds for an instant perma ban. Your punishment is proof that people get punished, so why would you think they wouldn't for spouting such vile garbage?","replies":[{"poster":"Rito Pariah","date":"2016-11-05T03:10:23.513+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"If using hate speech was an insta permaban, then why is it so prevalent? Why do I keep seeing it? Why does it keep happening? Why am I allowed to be victimized by these pre-made teams of trolls? And again. Nothing posted above deserves a chat ban.

No. Not even close.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-11-05T03:27:10.491+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You mentioned in another response that you have been chat banned previously. The punishment tiers escalate, so while you can skip tiers for excessive behaviours, even 'mundane' negative behaviour will net you a 14 day ban if you've had the two chat restriction prior and have shown no signs of reforming.\n\nYour case to me looks like one where the behaviour is not so severe, but is consistent, and may be coupled with in game behaviour that was also detected.\n\nThis punishment is a warning, and for your sake I'll make this very clear, the fourth punishment tier is permanent account suspension.","replies":[{"poster":"Rito Pariah","date":"2016-11-05T03:45:29.723+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Then the rule is overly broad.

Do I think this alone should get you banned? Probably not, but we on boards have no way of knowing if it was this alone. It could have been a consistent thing, it could have had in game behaviour to go with it, there could have been more than one game that you didn't post. We just don't know.\n\nI can almost guarantee there is more to this than just this one log, and if you aren't aware of what it is then I would suggest submitting a ticket to player support so they can clarify for you.\n\nThe rule is broad to stop those who want to walk the line between ok and not ok, knowing that they can get away with scummy behaviour because it isn't explicitly stated as disallowed. Having a generalised \"Don't be a jerk\" prevents this.","replies":[{"poster":"Rito Pariah","date":"2016-11-05T04:12:32.776+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wasn't a jerk. I wasn't happy about the fact that the entire rest of my team was flaming and trolling me. But I wasn't a jerk. I wasnt flaming them. I wasn't being toxic. If the rule is broad enough to ban someone for this game. And when I hit the I understand button, I hit copy text. So this is the entirety of what I was banned for. This is not something someone should be punished for let alone banned. This is heavy handed. This is reaching. This is BS.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"nerak23","date":"2016-11-05T02:51:46.759+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Who really wants to play a game like this?

People never get a ban because of a single game unless it's something really egregious. \n\nThat said, calling for reports is a nono. Not only it's harassment, it's actually useless because one report on a single game is exactly the same as 9. What matters is the number of reported games, not the number of reports.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KVbqbFsC8e","date":"2016-11-05T02:24:11.274+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":6,"body":"Well, if you had a 4man premade intentionally feeding while telling you to kill yourself, but you called them \"bad\" in retaliation, you'd still get banned.

And *I* get banned over it? Regardless if Ive been punished in the past or not. THIS was not worthy of punishment. If they wanna ban me over something, ban me for something I actually did. This game was not worthy of punishment. And if it is, the rules are too broad.

You don't always get what you want. It would help to relax your standards for what roles you play and be a little bit flexible when playing with people you don't know. Otherwise, if you want your role every single game, find some friends to play with and fill out a 5-player queue.","replies":[{"poster":"Rito Pariah","date":"2016-11-05T04:06:29.598+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you could read the other people in chat it would provide context. I wasnt being childish. I called adc and the enemy team literally said they were trolling and then kept rotating bot to make sure I couldnt do anything. Then they started using homophobic slurs and cursing me so I checked out. Again. I understand banning people or chat banning them for toxicity. If this is toxic, this game needs to be rated pg13 and made only for kids. Because this is nothing. This is not worthy of punishment. You can claim I was toxic all you want. This is petty. This is reaching so hard that it makes me realize that you cannot talk in chat without being ready for punishment.\n\nIm of the opinion now that the only reason not to get punished it to /mute all at the beginning of every game.\n\nOr just don't play.","replies":[{"poster":"elduris","date":"2016-11-05T04:23:49.120+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The only thing that matters when it comes to your behavior...is your behavior. You didn't get the role you wanted, and instead of adapting and choosing a role that was available, you decided to pick for the role you didn't get, refuse to cooperate with your team, and suggest a surrender immediately after entering the game. \n\nYou didn't get a ban for this game alone. You got a ban because, after two separate warnings, you continued to have a negative attitude in game. My advice would be to take this time and reflect on your attitude, identify the mistakes you tend to make, and work on resolving those. When your ban is up, you'll be ready to get back in game. I would also take this break very seriously, because the next punishment is a permanent ban.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"YOU LOST LMAO","date":"2016-11-05T03:31:36.082+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"your attitude was very toxic and unsportsmanlike,\nyour ban was well deserved,\n\nstay banned kid,\nstay hypocritical","replies":[]}]}
