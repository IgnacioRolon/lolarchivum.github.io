The only fix is to finish the game, and reboot the client (and even that doesn't always work).\r\n\r\nIt is extremely annoying to play with a locked camera as I miss a lot of vision. \r\n\r\nI have played around with the settings, and in semi-lock, it does work when I move the mouse along the corner, but the champ has to be in-frame,when I unlock it again it doesn't work. \r\n\r\nI uninstalled the game, and re-installed it, and nothing, same problem.\r\n\r\nI also read other threats and tried all suggestions: move the small icon beside the mini-map into the mini-map, use 'Y', etc... but nothing has fixed it so far.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions?\r\n\r\nThank you","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-29T23:55:02.053+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There may be an issue with your configuration here that's causing a problem with your camera interface.  The fix here would be to reset your configuration files, and not perform any file modifications afterwards:  \n\n **Log into the game** then hop into **a custom game**. *Alt+Tab* out of the match, then navigate to your League installation folder, which should be in C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\n\nDelete the folder named **Config**\n\nOnce you've deleted the folder, leave the custom match. You'll then want to hop into another custom match to confirm the changes were saved.\n\nLet me know if you still have any issues after!","replies":[{"poster":"SeverusStark","date":"2016-09-30T01:21:48.131+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll give this a shot and get back to you!\n\nThanks for taking the time!","replies":[{"poster":"SeverusStark","date":"2016-09-30T01:51:13.224+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So it worked on the first game right after I deleted the file. The camera worked perfectly on unlocked.\nHowever, once I started the second custom game I had the same issue.\n\nSo I am guessing that that is the problem, but the changes are not saving.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-30T17:52:35.012+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's strange to hear, but we'd like to keep helping!

The camera jumps to wherever I click on the minimap, but then again, remains locked and I am not able to move it by moving the mouse along the corners.\n\nThanks for the suggestion, though!","replies":[]}]}]}
