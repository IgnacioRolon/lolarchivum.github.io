I recently returned to League within the past 4 or 5 months and after a patch or two I have noticed that my Corporate Mundo skin seems to be faulty. The skin itself visually is fine, but he does a mix of his Corporate Mundo quotes and his normal Mundo quotes. In fact, it's mostly his normal Mundo quotes. He says the odd corporate witticism, but I find them rare. This has been ongoing for probably 2 or 3 months now. I tried googling it but could not find anyone with similar issues. Do you know how to fix this? Thanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Zimberfly","date":"2019-04-09T20:03:15.939+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi there!\n\nThanks for the heads up!
