I can play ARAM all day will no problems but anytime I try to play Rift or anything other than ARAM  I will start to lag at the 10 min mark or so. I start out great but then i will get unplayable lag. I never have anything else running and i have tried all the different setting and changing the compatibility, I just don't know what else it can be. As I said ARAM runs fine. anyother suggestions would be great thank you.\r\n\r\nRouter:\r\nBelkin\r\n\r\nComp specs:\r\nAsus F550v\r\nWindows 10 Home( i play on windows 7 compat)\r\nIntel core i7-6700HQ CPU @ 2.60GHz 2592 Mhz 4 cores\r\nRam: 8 GB\r\nCard: NVIDIA Geforce GTX 950M","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-21T21:55:18.036+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"When you say you start to lag, is this an increase in FPS or ping? Or do you actually see any visible increase in those numbers at all?
