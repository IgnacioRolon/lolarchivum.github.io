Credit for the idea goes to the lovely [Bioluminescence](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/story-art/Wns6RG83-2018-lore-tournament-vote-for-your-favorite-stories-of-the-year) of course, but this time, I'm doing it on my own.\n\n#####**_~~Rules~~_**\n\nIncluded in the tournament are all _main universe_ stories released this year, as well as **Halfway between the Stars and Earth** and **Demacian Heart** from last December which could not fit into the last tournament. Likewise, if we see new stories towards the end of December, they will probably go into the next tournament. No comics, cinematics or AU stories.\nI will use the following format, which will correspond to one battle a day each. I plan for each post to go up around 5 pm CET / 8 am PST; at that time voting for the last post will conclude. \n ######I'm already late, but let's ignore that. My goal is to get each post out before 6pm.\nIt's a standard KO-Bracket, so if a story loses, it's out.\n\n---- \n| Day  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | Story 1 | vs &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  | Story 2 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| [Day 1](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/story-art/R1qqQu0p-2019-lore-tournament-day-1-what-once-sailed-free-vs-aftermath) | **What Once Sailed Free** | vs  | ~~Aftermath~~ |\n| [Day 2](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/story-art/yzQXWqZq-2019-lore-tournament-day-2) |\tThe Winterspike Road | vs | The Final Reign | \n| Day 3 | The Recruit | vs | Trouble |\n| Day 4 | Demacian Heart | vs | Turmoil |\n| Day 5| The Harder Path | vs | Fit to Rule |\n| Day 6 | Halfway Between the Stars and Earth &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  | vs | For Those Who Have Fallen |\n| Day 7 | The Echoes left Behind | vs | The Whispering Doodad |\n| Day 8 | Adaptation | vs | Message on a Blade's Edge |\n| Day 9 | In the Fires of Justice | vs | Prayer to a Crumbling Shrine |\n| Day 10 | Canticle of the Winged Sisters | vs | Snow Day |\n| Day 11 | With the Flowers | vs  | Thorns of the Black Rose |\n| Day 12 | Homecoming | vs | Roots of a Poisoned Tree |\n| Day 13 | Silence for the Damned | vs | ? |\n| Day 14 | The biggest Catch | vs | Remember Me |\n| Day 15 | Homebound | vs | The Shackles of Belief |\n| Day 16 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | The Voices of the Dead | vs | ?  | \n\nhttps://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/365550473429909504/648237903100510229/WT7mmUN.png\n\n#####**_~~A troubled guardian~~_**\n\nThe first battle of the tournament revolves around Xin Zhao, the Viscero. \nIn our first story, **What Once sailed free**, we learn about how he found new meaning in life after being defeated and ready to die, pledging his life to King Jarvan III of Demacia.\nIn the second story, **Aftermath**, he reflects on what he could have done to honor this pledge. Was there any way to protect the king from the rebelling mages? In the end, he joins Prince Jarvan IV, apparent heir to the throne.\n\n----\n\nhttps://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/365550473429909504/640814050506309647/unknown.png\n\n[What Once Sailed Free](https://universe.leagueoflegends.com/en_US/story/whatoncesailedfree/) _by Michael Luo_\n\n##vs\n\nhttps://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/365550473429909504/640815795051429908/unknown.png\n\n[Aftermath](https://universe.leagueoflegends.com/en_US/story/xinzhao-aftermath-story/) _by Anthony Reynolds_","replies":[{"poster":"SkiptoMyLuo","date":"2019-12-06T23:32:24.264+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm honored to be even mentioned in the same post as Ant Reynolds.

I was not sure what it was when I first read the match-up so I read them both again and I must say... There is real emotion, I feel the sincerity of Xin, J3 and even Tianna. A man at the end of his days seeking out some meaning for it all and finding it in the least expected place. It's an amazing story and deserves to progress.\n\nAftermath - Even though it was written by a different author, I feel a likeness in the way the story was told to the first one. A shared respect for the characters and the world. I felt the loss of a man who had not just lost a beloved master, but a brother and a friend, and the way he assumed that everyone would judge him for not being there just shows the kind of honorable man he is. I couldn't help but think about Azir and Xerath and how the latter forgot his place while Xin remained firm even in his old age, truly a man for Demacian soldiers to aspire to be like. I was not a fan of the fighting and honestly I would have appreciated if that interaction was between Xin and Tianna instead (it's unfortunate a romance didn't develop there over the years... then again, who's to say it didn't? ;) ). I dont like this \"Let's continue the war on magic\" J4, but I feel that this is just a phase for him (Because shyvanna exists) so not too worried.\n\nI ended up rambling about the second one but that's just because it's current, this is happening here and now and is wide open to speculation and that's exciting for any lore fanatic on here... But I'd have to give my vote to What once sailed free. It's a story that touches the heart, makes you fall in love with J3 and his wisdom and genuine spirit while making you feel passion for Xin, a man who had never known purpose, a man about to die after living an empty life being confronted with destiny and managing to grab hold of his true purpose... it really speak to me personally.","replies":[]},{"poster":"dontspinbutwin","date":"2019-12-01T23:59:49.909+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"What once sailed free wins, but only slightly. Both stories were massively immersive, and both portrayed xin zhao well. Only reason I think What once Sailed Free wins, is simply preference. I liked seeing Xin Zhao's origins, and seeing how he acted as he did. Here, we are introduced to Xin Zhao's strength, his personality, and his loyalty, and these traits are seen again in Aftermath.\n\n\nAhhhh I wish this could end in a draw. These two were some of my favorite stories, its hard to say which is best. \n\nStill gonna have to What once Sailed Free. Glorious stories on both sides!","replies":[]},{"poster":"zaire90","date":"2019-12-01T19:51:58.867+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Damn its really been a year since the last one.
