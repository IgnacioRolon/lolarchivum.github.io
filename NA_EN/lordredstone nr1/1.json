That's not a month or a year off, that's just wrong. It was released on the 29th of May 2019 during patch [9.11](https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/champions-skins/creative-spotlight/911-lore-update) .\r\n - Mordekaiser's color story [The Final Reign](https://universe.leagueoflegends.com/en_US/story/mordekaiser-color-story/) seems correct, but there is a duplicate just at the end of the website. It's a different story (the [URL](https://universe.leagueoflegends.com/en_US/story/mordekaiser-color/) is different) with the same content, but it is missing art and the release date. It should just be deleted.","replies":[{"poster":"The Iceborn","date":"2019-06-21T17:12:01.053+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"Good catch, hope they do something about it","replies":[]},{"poster":"Riot Squimpy","date":"2019-06-25T17:53:10.056+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the info everyone! \nWe'll go ahead and work on getting these fixed right now.
