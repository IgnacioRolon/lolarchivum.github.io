Obviously, I will discuss the plot of the current issue as well as all previous issues, so this will contain spoilers. However, I will wait for the Universe release before I post my threads, so everyone who wants to read the comic for free there has a chance to do so.\n\nI'll give a short summary of what happened, then go deeper into interesting details we learned about the characters, different cities or Demacia as a whole.\nFinally, I want to pose some questions and I would very much appreciate if John O'Bryan, Odin or someone else working on the comic could answer at least some of them. (No spoilers for future issues though!)\n\n#**_~~Spoilers! Last warning!~~_**\n\n> # Summary\n\nhttps://universe-meeps.leagueoflegends.com/v1/assets/images/comic-series/luxcomic/Luxcomic-issue-1-link.jpg\n\nWe start off in the ruined city of Demacia, where Lux introduces us via some narration. This narration style is similar to the one found in Ashe: Warmother. What's notable is that we find the teaser phrase \"It was my light that did this\" on the very first page. I could call that foreshadowing, but I think it was obvious to anyone who has been keeping up with the lore and read about Sylas. Lux carries a wounded Garen somewhere, and then we jump back to the present. \n\nGaren and Lux ride through the city (the same street that was destroyed in the first image) and have a conversation about a \"witch\" when a mage tries to flee from the mageseekers. Lux goes to help some bystander wounded by the mage, and Garen runs after the villain. He smashes down a bridge in an epic move, and they manage to arrest the young mage. there is some more conversation about the mages and the anti-magical laws, and Sylas of Dregbourne is mentioned. In the process, Lux' hand starts to glow. She tries to contain it but her old tricks fail. In the narration, she is worried about Garen seeing it. \"_Maybe he's never seen it._\"\n\nLux then decides to look for information in the headquarter of the mageseekers, where they keep all confiscated books and magical stuff. In the night, she is allowed into the headquarters due to her special position as a child of the crownguard familiy, as well as her position in the Illuminators. She is looking to contain her light, but does not find anything useful.\nIn the meantime, Garen discusses with their aunt Tianna (once Leader of the DV, now advisor to the king) what they should do about Lux. Apparently both know about her disregard for the laws against magic, and worse, about her **powers**. They talk about the possibility of marrying her to Prince Jarvan IV Lightshield, where she would be safe from the mageseekers.\n\nBack to Lux, she has not found anything on her powers and decides to look around in the headquarters. She winds up in the cells, where she is stopped by guards. After introducing herself with the Crownguard name, she gets a free tour around the dungeons. (Apparently the name is stronger than her position with the Illuminators.) She sees the horror of the imprisoned mages, who can not be sent to the hinterlands, and finally winds up on the door to Sylas' cell.\nThe warden sends her in, but stays outside. We get to see a creepy Sylas, who tells her they are so very much alike,  and then the issue is over.\n\n---\n> # People &amp; Places\n\n_*~~Lux~~*_\nhttps://universe-meeps.leagueoflegends.com/v1/assets/images/demacia-sketches/lux-demacia-sketch.jpg\n\nLux clearly is afraid of her powers, but can't contain them. The last time that has happened, she got help from the Illuminators (according to her color story and some bits in _Flesh and Stone_) but now even that is failing. She is clearly growing stronger and stronger and can't control her powers anymore. She is so desperate for help, but can ask no one because that would get her imprisoned or exiled. So she turns to the mageseeker headquarters to look for something, anything, that could help her, she does not find it, but stumbles upon a creepy prisoner.\n\nI really liked the art style and the portrayal of Lux, only one thing bothers me: **Boob plate**. I guess they kept it because of her iconic look, but that still does not make it good armor design. Even if it's just ceremonial, to look good, please just don't.\n\n----\n\n_*~~Garen~~*_\nhttps://universe-meeps.leagueoflegends.com/v1/assets/images/demacia-sketches/garen-demacia-sketch.jpg\n\nGaren is the strong warrior like he is supposed to be, he stops a criminal on the streets, as his duty as Sword-Captain of the Dauntless Vanguard commands. (It's not clear that he is the sword-captain, but he is addressed as \"Captain\" so I figured he should be sword-captain by now. Keep in mind that this happens some weeks before Sylas' release, so at the latest point of their story arcs.)\nWhen at home, he reveals how deeply he cares for Lux: He tries to protect her at any cost and wants to have her marry the prince (which, let's be honest, wouldn't be too bad). \n\n----\n\n_*~~Sylas and the Revolution~~*_\nhttps://universe-meeps.leagueoflegends.com/v1/assets/images/turmoil_bg.jpg\n\nSylas is still imprisoned, so there is not much of a revolution going on. We see almost nothing of him, but when he finally steps out of the shadow, he's creepy as f\\*ck. Exactly how I imagined it, excellent art, would not want to see again. It gets even better (or worse, it depends) when you see the cover for the next issue [here](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D6CozzyWsAAhekQ.jpg).\n\n----\n\n_*~~Demacia~~*_\nhttps://universe.leagueoflegends.com/images/demacia_emblem.png\n\nWe get to see some of the \"Great City of Demacia\", which looks stunning. Probably one of the best places to live, if you are not a mage. \nSad to see that bridge destroyed. Of course, we also get a look at the darker side, the imprisoned mages. If just the prisoners in the retaining cells are desperate and almost starving, then what is going on even further down? They are in petricite shackles and occasionally forced to drink petricite elixir, and you can see they are in great agony. Of course, these are the worst mages, most of them are sent into exile in the hinterlands, but it's still a glimpse of the dark side of the law that Lux has seen.\n\n----\n\n> # Final thoughts\n\nThat was definitely an interesting first issue. We saw Demacia burn, probably due to Sylas and his revolution, then cut back to Lux and Garen where all seems well. Demacia is doing great, but we already see some of the anti-mage-laws in Demacia, especially when they chase down a criminal, but for now they accept mages that are benign. As we knew from _Turmoil_ and _Demacian Heart_, Mages can choose to be registered and not use their powers, but are allowed to live in exile in the \"hinterlands\". Only after Sylas' revolution they started to imprison all of them.\n\nI liked the hints of other stories and cameos in this issue: The panel where Lux went to help an injured man buried under rocks reminded me of her color story [Last Light](https://universe.leagueoflegends.com/en_US/story/lux-color-story/) where she arrives after an earthquake. Then Garen also mentioned a \"Witch in the Woods\", which to me looks like a nod to _his_ color story, [The Soldier and the Hag](https://universe.leagueoflegends.com/en_US/story/garen-color-story/).\nAlso, there is the seemingly less important NPC who lets her enter the library and introduces himself as Jaredan. **Riot** Jaredan maybe?\n\nSo as a conclusion, nothing major has happened here, but the most important thing is that she met Sylas. It's been a great issue setting up the location, the anti-mage-policies and Lux' inner conflict.Now we have to wait for the next issue to find out what Sylas can teach Lux... and what happens then.\n\n> # Questions\n\nI had some questions, mostly regarding the timeline of this series and the connection to the other lore, as well as a question about the different versions of the comic.\n\n1. How old are Garen and Lux during this issue? I assume it's close to Sylas breaking out, so they must be around 20-25 years old. Is that correct?\n2. What happened to Tianna? Can you tell us more about the former Sword-Captain, now High Marshal to the king?\n3. Unrelated to the series, but are the Lightbringers and Illuminators the same order? Is one of these organizations a part of the other one? What about the Radiant Ones? (Or is that too spoiler-y?)\n_For Demacia_ mentions the \"Lightbringers\", but Lux' biography and her color story _Last Light_ call them \"Illuminators\". On the map and the universe page for Demacia, they are once again called \"Lightbringers\". In this comic, it's \"Illuminators\" again. I just would like some clarification, unless that will be answered in a future issue.\n4. When does this happen in relation to other important events of the Lore, such as the Ascension of Azir, the Battle of the Placidium or Swain's rise to power? I would like to see any connection to current events so we can sort stuff into a timeline, but for now Demacia has no connection to any other nation: Their lore reflects their isolationist politics.\n5. How can we buy this comic to support you and the lore team? Are there special editions again? If so, what bonus material do they include?\n\nThanks for reading this far! Let me know what you think of this issue and maybe add your own thoughts and questions for the writers!","replies":[{"poster":"a highwayman","date":"2019-05-09T03:24:08.126+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey, thanks so much for reading! I'm Mary, the Riot editor on the comics team -- here are some quick non-spoiler answers to your questions, with my apologies that these aren't super in-depth:\n\n_How old are Garen and Lux during this issue? I assume it's close to Sylas breaking out, so they must be around 20-25 years old. Is that correct?_\n\nYep. We're thinking Garen is about 25 and Lux is about 19 in the comic.\n\n_What happened to Tianna? Can you tell us more about the former Sword-Captain, now High Marshal to the king?_\n\nThe comic won't be super-focused on Tianna, so I'll leave her stories for a future time, but she does show up again in the series.\n\n_Unrelated to the series, but are the Lightbringers and Illuminators the same order? Is one of these organizations a part of the other one? What about the Radiant Ones? (Or is that too spoiler-y?)_\n\nFor the sake of clarity, we're trying to default to using \"Illuminators\" consistently and phasing out \"Lightbringers\" -- they're the same organization. The Radiant Ones are a special unit of the Illuminators. Without wanting to spoil anything, in this comic, we're not touching on the Radiant Ones, but that doesn't mean Lux will no longer be connected to them -- just that she's not yet a member of that elite group at the time of these specific events.\n\n_When does this happen in relation to other important events of the Lore, such as the Ascension of Azir, the Battle of the Placidium or Swain's rise to power?_ \n\nThis is a great question that I unfortunately can't publicly answer 100% confidently right now, but it's something we're paying attention to internally. I know this is an underwhelming answer. \n\n_How can we buy this comic to support you and the lore team? Are there special editions again? If so, what bonus material do they include?_\n\nI'm always moved when people ask this question. THANK YOU! We're not doing special editions this time, but you can still buy single issues digitally on [Comixology](https://www.comixology.com/League-Of-Legends-Lux-1-of-5/digital-comic/772304?ref=c2VhcmNoL2luZGV4L2Rlc2t0b3Avc2xpZGVyTGlzdC90b3BSZXN1bHRzU2xpZGVy) if you prefer that reading experience. We are also totally happy when people read it for free on [Universe](https://universe.leagueoflegends.com/en_US/comic/lux/issue-1/0/)! The physical collection of the complete series releases in November and is up for pre-order on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/League-Legends-Lux-John-OBryan/dp/1302919431/ref=sr_1_1?crid=R3GOEGOOVC14&amp;keywords=lux+comic&amp;qid=1557370887&amp;s=books&amp;sprefix=lux+comi%2Caps%2C173&amp;sr=1-1). If you have a local comics shop, you can also ask them to order a copy for you, which helps support the store and encourages them to consider stocking future League comics. Letting them know it's published by Marvel and comes out in November will help them find it. \n\nWe haven't decided exactly what bonus material to include in the collection yet, but I personally love backmatter, so I'll always push to get something special in there if it's possible. If you have things you'd particularly like to see in bonus content in the future, I'd love to hear about that, too! I'm a little internet-shy and don't post often, but I do check the boards, and I'm very interested in hearing what you all like (or don't like) and what you want to see more of.\n\nFinally... regarding boob-plate. Yeah. So. Honest answer: we're experimenting with a few things in the comics right now, and one of those things is character recognizability. Lux is maximally on-model here, and my personal takeaway is that a more varied take on outfits will often be a good call in future series.\n\nThanks for checking out the comic, and for taking the time to post this!","replies":[{"poster":"AnotherPurple379","date":"2019-05-09T03:47:44.627+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Okay actually, thank you for addressing the boobplate issue and explaining the reasoning behind keeping it. I may not like the end result of keeping it, but I can totally understand where you're coming from when you say you're experimenting with character recognizability.

It's one of the reasons I liked the Ashe comic. But hey! You guys are the ones making the call, so I'll wait to see what you decide in the end.\n\nCan I also ask a question for clarification? Do Garen and Tianna really know that Lux has magic? Most people seen to interpret that this is the case with that one scene between them, but I interpreted Garen's words of \"flaws\" as Lux's consistent questioning of the law, not her magic powers itself.

Sometimes people aren't ready to consciously acknowledge what they might understand deep down. Garen loves his sister, and that's what he wants to focus on.\n\nTianna is very smart and very protective of her family and their reputation. Garen is talking about the general possibility of Lux making a mistake and getting herself into trouble. I think Tianna understands what he's saying (and not saying), and she may have her own suspicions, but she's interested in solving the problem on a practical level.","replies":[{"poster":"Terozu","date":"2019-05-09T05:01:04.499+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Lux has a defined age thats older than her old range!

(I thought they were 22 and 26 respectively, based on their other stories). Time to do some maths and revise my timeline.\n\n_Lightbringers_: Good to see that you thought about that too, clarity in names is important. Now that I think of it, \"Lightbringers\"  could actually be a Demacian name, it shares the first word with the Lightshields. (And it could also be a song title of an awesome metal band :D ). \n\n_Relation to other events_: If you had answered that, you would be my hero. But to be honest, I didn't expect it anyway. There simply is no connection like Taliyah, who connects Noxus, Ionia and Shurima (all of the major factions, and each of them had their own important recent event that I listed: Swain's rise to power, the Battle of the Placidium and the Ascension of Azir). \nI guess we have to wait for an official timeline, but again it's great to see you are talking about that internally.\n\n_Bonus content_: Bonus material is always good, I think I would buy almost everything that you put in there.\nA legitimate concern is that we have to pay for Lore, and I would like to avoid that. Even though I and many others will gladly pay for physical editions, there are just as many who can not afford to or simply don't want to. Paywalling stories is not cool. \nBonus content in the form of stories - maybe. I once saw the idea of fleshing out some parts that were skimmed over in the comic, maybe the chase from the perspective of the mage? Or how Ashe and Sejuani stay at the village, then sneak away in the middle of the night. Short stories that give a different perspective, but have no overall impact because the main plot has been told in the comic.\nThat being said, give me all the bonus content you have! Additional notes and concept art maybe, and a glossary if necessary. Warmother had one, but that was because it used many words and phrases that were new, even to folks that read the lore. \n\nI think I can say more on that topic when my copy of Warmother arrives.","replies":[{"poster":"Terozu","date":"2019-05-09T18:40:27.072+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"I feel like the reason you thought she was 22 was Necrit's video on ages.
