My top, mid, and jung is really bad now because I tend to play mainly support. This puts me into a pickle for ranked. Do I just play support like Braum and Thresh in solo que even though I am not a &quot;carry&quot; or do I try to learn a different role. I do know that supports can help carry games though because you can set up some awesome plays! At the same time though you can only help the adc so much, I am bronze 1 and ended last season silver 2. I feel  like I should just support, but want to get others opinions on this!","replies":[{"poster":"UrgotToBeKidding","date":"2015-05-30T08:06:51.419+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are two correct answers to this question.\n\nThe easiest answer is to keep playing support for fun. This game is not important to be good at. If you will have more fun supporting silver than learning other roles and improving your finger speed, keep doing that. Fun should be foremost IMO when you are not making money from playing the game.\n\nHowever, if you have your mind set on climbing ranks, that is going to happen VERY slowly by playing non-scaling champions. As your mechanics improve (IF they do), you will be offering less influence on the game than you could be. Most very high ranking players who are pushing on a smurf will play characters they can get a lot of kills on. Mechanical skill difference is basically the only important factor below Platinum. To raise your ranks faster you need to be a dominant influence on the game. You could maybe accomplish this by building mage sets on supports (Annie, Zyra, Leblanc). However if I were to assume you are capable, learning other roles would be more effective.\n\nI added you ingame.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Their Jungler","date":"2015-05-30T07:12:20.625+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, someone's got to do it!","replies":[{"poster":"RuinedDruid","date":"2015-05-30T07:49:58.699+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Haha ya, but is it going to work for trying to get higher ranks.","replies":[{"poster":"FedAsFuk","date":"2015-05-30T21:43:12.068+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If that were true there would be no support mains above gold. It can works, it usually does work, you actually influence a game more/as much as an ADC, you control the bot lane, keeping them safe, possibly getting them fed, warding objectives, tracking the enemy JG (you are least focused on in lane activities and can help JG with that), you can babysit carries in teamfights (support engages are rarely worth being unable to peel for carries, especially in soloQ). You also are the teams support, so if/when lanes become dead to the JG and inefficient to gank for as the JG, the support roaming is good, it gives ADC soloXP putting them in a better spot as well as helping a struggling lane, can also roam to winning lanes to snowball and create pressure.\n\nAll in all, i would suggest peel focused supports, Annie, Braum, Morgana, Nami (not recommended for lower elos), Thresh, Bard works surprisingly well. Generally for lower elos play simple things that allow you to sit and protect a carry.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"rescued","date":"2015-05-30T12:48:38.694+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To carry as a support, make sure that you roam to other lanes and help your teammates out, set up kills for them. :) I love playing Leona for this reason.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ChewyBaccaWookie","date":"2015-05-30T10:45:53.330+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It depends on your adc and the team, in the lobby you cant know how well your team will do so i would say in high elo it is good to play sometimes support (i allways ask in chat if anyone is main adc and if so i go support) but in low elo like bronze/silver i woudnt go support (if you can), coz if you want to get out of bronze and even silver the best way is to play the carry from mid or jungle or duoQ bot lane.","replies":[]},{"poster":"drew parrymore","date":"2015-05-30T07:27:55.987+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:12}} {{champion:412}} {{champion:111}} {{champion:89}}","replies":[{"poster":"RuinedDruid","date":"2015-05-30T07:50:28.793+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"what about Braum?","replies":[]}]}]}
