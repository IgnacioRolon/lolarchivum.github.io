Also, if {{champion:161}} auto attacks after using one of his abilities, he will freeze in....an odd position, but still able to move. This bug doesn&#039;t really affect the game, and it is quite funny to see that &quot;odd position&quot;, but I just wanted to point this out. I&#039;m not sure if this is all of the {{champion:161}} skins, but I noticed it when I played using the Arclight skin. So yeah.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-12-04T02:29:33.249+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey DexterousFlip,\n\nThanks for the report!
