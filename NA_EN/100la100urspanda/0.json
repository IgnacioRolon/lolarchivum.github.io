Here's some things i've found to be very helpful.\n\n1. So it does all depend on when you play, Usually you will play vs other unranked players. After you win a few games you may go vs some bronze and low silver, but they try and keep you in you're own skill ranking. \n\n2. There's not that much between ranked and normal. I am almost only playing ranked these days because i find normals are full of afkers. The biggest difference is that in ranked games, you will almost never run into troll things like a talon support or a caitlyn jungle. People will usually not want to ff unless it's a loss on matter what(it's 0/40 in kills and you're an early game team for example). \n\n3. So it does all depend on what roles your looking to play, ill go into detail about that a little later\n\n4a. If you want to increase game mechanics then i would just say play the champ. It's that simple. I was able to teach myself Zed without ever looking at a single guide by just playing him a shit ton.\n\n4b. Teamfights depend on you're roll and champ\n\nSo here's some tips i found to be helpful. I went from bronze 5 all the up to silver 5 back in season 5 and have been climbing higher and higher every season.\n\n1. **Understand the different roles and what you want to do in those rolls**\nIf you want to play ranked, you need to have 2 main rolls, and be able to play the others and not feed in case of auto fill. Top, Jungle, Middle, ADCarry and Support all have different jobs and it depends on what champ you play in those said roles. Ill go though each class that plays in top and list easy champs in each of those rolls.\nTop laners are usually tanks(like {{champion:36}} {{champion:57}} {{champion:54}} {{champion:78}} ), Bruisers(like {{champion:122}} {{champion:86}}  {{champion:83}}  {{champion:24}} ) or the much harder Carries( {{champion:23}}{{champion:80}} ). If you are first starting out i would avoid playing carries until later, tanks and fighters are much easier.\nTank team fights are to front line and just sit there and soak damage while ccing the other team, stopping them from getting to your back line or being the engage.\nFighter team fights depends on the champ, but they are still front line, soak damage and help you're back line get through the tanks\n\nJungles are usually Tanks({{champion:32}} {{champion:59}} {{champion:254}} {{champion:113}}) or Assassins({{champion:11}} {{champion:28}} {{champion:56}}).\nTank jungles have the same teamfight as top lane tanks\nAssassin jungles are mid line waiting to find a good time to go in and try and get onto the back line and melt them before you die\n\nMid Laners are usually Control Mages({{champion:1}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:74}} ), Burst Mages({{champion:99}} {{champion:161}} {{champion:45}}) or Assassins({{champion:245}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:103}})\nControl Mages are Back line using you're CC spells to try and lock down as much of the other team as you can while still putting out consistent DPS.\nBurst Mages are also back line, but they're job is to try and burst down the back(if they can) or the mid line\nAssassin Mids are kinda like jungle assassins in team fights but much more bursty.\n\nADCs are ALWAYS Marksman({{champion:22}} {{champion:51}} {{champion:222}} {{champion:18}}) only. They're are different kinds of them but they all have the same job.\nIn teamfights you are back line, and you have 2 jobs, do damage and **SURVIVE!!!!** Attack what you can when you can. do NOT run into the other team's back line, play safe and let you're tanks keep you safe. You are the carry, LIVE.\n\nSupports are mainly Support Mages({{champion:117}} {{champion:37}} {{champion:16}} {{champion:26}}), Utility Mages({{champion:25}} {{champion:267}} {{champion:40}}) and Tanks({{champion:44}} {{champion:89}} {{champion:201}}  {{champion:12}}).\nBoth support mages and Utility mages spend their time in the back line with their ADC, you're job is to LITERALLY baby sit you're ADC. Buff them and let them carry you.\nTanks are back line with their ADC waiting for someone to try and kill you're ADC, so you peel them off you're ADC with your CC and peel spells.\nPick which one you want to play and try those champs out when free week comes. If you just want to buy champs RN, {{champion:24}} top {{champion:254}} jungle {{champion:1}} mid {{champion:51}} ADC {{champion:201}} Support. They are all really good and are very easy to learn and pick up\n\n2. **Don't Rage**\nBe able to be un-tiltable. If this means you /Muteall at the start of every game, do it. If you tilt and rage, you WILL lose. with out any questions.\n\n3. **WARD**\nFor the love of god, use your Trinket and ward. Get your {{item:3340}} and put wards down and buy {{item:2055}}. Vision WINS GAMES. No joke, If you have a ward up, put down a ward in a bush or somewhere to give you good vision.\n\n4. **Understand you can't win them all**\nNo one will win every game, everyone will lose one here and there, people will go on 20 game losing streaks and others will be on 20 game winning streaks. Just accept each loss and move on\n\n5. **People have Bad Games**\nIf you're Mid is 0/5, don't rage at them. Calling them trash and raging at them all game will do NOTHING. The only thing it will do is make them want to AFK and leave. Be nice to them, Maybe something is happening to them in their normal life, Break up, Death in the family, Depressed, or hell even an abusive home, and they're playing league to forget. Don't just go off on people, let them play and accept that maybe they aren't the best, maybe they got auto filled or anything BUT rage at them.\nI hope this helps, good luck! :D","replies":[{"poster":"100la100UrsPanda","date":"2018-10-12T05:55:00.476+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ok thx very much for info","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"im not your sis","date":"2018-10-07T19:54:40.177+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1 - your initial mmr is somewhere inbetween silver 2 so expect your first games to be vs silvers / low golds. if you win your first 2-3 matches ull start playing vs high golds and so on\n2 - not really people are just more toxic in ranked since its ranked and they lose lp \n3 - depends what your main role is?\n4- just play a lot, mechanics arent that important if your macro is good enough to climb","replies":[{"poster":"100la100UrsPanda","date":"2018-10-07T20:01:29.125+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am good at jgle and mid , i am decent adc  , play good sup , and realy suck tryhard at adc (when for example hecarim always come full speed +ulty)\n\nAnd.. wath is macro? i am not familiar ?\n\nIs there a mmr for normal games ? if it is where i check it?","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2018-10-07T20:04:02.537+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=100la100UrsPanda,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=cRn0n1OV,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2018-10-07T20:01:29.125+0000)\n>\n> I am good at jgle and mid , i am decent adc  , play good sup , and realy suck tryhard at adc (when for example hecarim always come full speed +ulty)\n> \n> And.. wath is macro? i am not familiar ?\n> \n> Is there a mmr for normal games ? if it is where i check it?\n\nmacro is basically decision making.\n\nyou cant check normal mmr, but yes normals do have their own mmr.","replies":[{"poster":"100la100UrsPanda","date":"2018-10-07T20:22:37.218+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ok thanks very much for your time and knoledge","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
