If i change servers, do i have to change my name?  This is while assuming that my name is not taken on the Japan server already.  I would also like to ask if i have to change my name if i switch from Japan server to NA (assuming name not taken).  I heard that if i switch over to Japan server, use japanese characters in my name, then switch back to NA, i can keep the japanese characters in my name.  I want to see if this is true or not.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-23T03:39:20.837+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You only need to change your summoner name if your current summoner name is already in use on the new region.
