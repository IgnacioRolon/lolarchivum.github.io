However, i have never given anyone my acc information other than my player name. I don't know if this is a bug or just a glitch, but I just want to let you guys know that this happened and i lost my first promo game because of this. I wouldn't lie and dodge on purpose because the season is almost over and I had a 9 game winning streak. This really saddened me and i hope this gets cleared up for others if this is really a bug.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-11T00:13:14.625+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is definitely not a bug, and I'd recommend **immediately changing your passwords** for both your League account and the email address associated with it.
