What is going on with your servers? I'm literally going to lose my mind if this keep happening. I get non stop lag. LITERALLY! Every match I play, I slide across the screen, all my skills go out as one, chat messages are delayed, it's making me go crazy. I'm not here to get the same response as you always say, oh well it's your ISP go talk with them. Yeah, I called them 3 times today, and they came over today as well and said everything was more than perfect so that was a waste. Do you not realize all of these people with problems the same like this and none are getting solved? Everyone in game says they're lagging but this lag is unplayable. I really don't want to quit League but, if Riot can't get their shit together, I'm done. Not like they'd care lol. I don't spend money so they don't help.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-07-22T18:14:11.535+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"High latency and packet loss can be caused by a number of factors.

Sorry if I sound mad it's really nerdy to say but not being able to play League daily is the most boring thing I have ever done. But, I will wait for them to reply.","replies":[{"poster":"Muffenman45","date":"2016-07-23T13:47:02.110+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i have a question i have had the same problem and i have some of the best internet with no one home only me on WiFi i still cant play its frustrating i cant play and might switch to melee or another moba it only happend in 6.14 clearly its not my fault because so many people have the problem riot i really love ur game but its in a state that is un playble can you plz give this a hotfix its so stupid that i cant play my favorite game because a new patch","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-23T22:13:56.614+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your network might be having a problem maintaining a strong connection to the game, and there may be a few factors including wireless.  A quick troubleshoot could be to try a wired connection to see if this improves your connection.  I also recommend going over our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to get this fixed for good.
