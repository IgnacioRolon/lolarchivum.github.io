I've tried everything possible to fix the ping but it's not working. I should stick to 38 ms but when I'm farming or whatever Im doing the ms will spikes to 800-900 and I freeze and then die. It happens basically all game every game. I just ran a speedtest for my internet and i have  4.76 Mbps download speed and 7.16 Mbps upload speed so it can't be my computer. I'm getting really sick of losing most games unless they carry me due to my high ms.","replies":[{"poster":"KÃ¼rama","date":"2016-07-21T08:01:14.953+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Connectivity between the servers and your network is seemingly poor.

It said I averaged 42 ms which is good but pinged like 700 ms at times. I don't understand though. I played LoL with good ping like a week ago but my wireless adapter thing that plugs into your computer, blew up so I went to get another one and ever since I started using this one, it has been doing that. It's brand new aswell. I'll do more research on packet loss. Thanks for the help you and Rineyy.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-21T17:30:33.941+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Considering the change was recent and the log reader's information suggests very bad packet loss, I'm betting that your ISP has changed your routing.  It sounds like it's taking a long way to reach our servers which is causing the delay you're seeing in game.  When you have some time, run a [traceroute ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752674-Network-System-and-League-of-Legends-Logs#wq2)to get an overview of your routing, and attach it in a [player support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).  Our tech team can look into this further and provide you with some options.","replies":[{"poster":"HamShinobi","date":"2016-07-21T17:46:42.435+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It says I can't CTRL+V but I can't right click, and the link to the doesn't work to download one.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-21T17:53:41.206+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You may need to run the command prompt as Admin, or need permission issues.

I know for sure 100% it's on you guys, not my router. I've literally done every possible thing in the entire world to fix this. I even reinstalled my whole pc and bought windows again. I tried on a different PC. I've called my ISP. The guy that came from Cox told me everything was going well and I had better internet in the area i live in than 82% of people in my area. If I have league open it dc's me from the internet JUST ON MY PC keep in mind and I have to reconnect every 5 minutes or so. But if I close league everything is fine again and the internet is goign super fast. I just got leave buster'd for dcing during champ select and didn't ban since I could click anything. I really don't know what to do anymore. All you see on boards is how they're lagging and in game it's all oh wow i love this 800ms and ping! I already know tech support is going to tell me, oh hello there! we see that you have problems and we'd like to help. OH lets see.... hmmm looks like your internet is garbage and should get it looked at bye! Always goes like that. Literally don't know what to do anymore.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HamShinobi","date":"2016-07-21T17:58:12.819+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, it doesn't work with admin either.
