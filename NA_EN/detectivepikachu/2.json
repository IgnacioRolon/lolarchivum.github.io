When your connection drops off during the switch from champ select to the game servers, you'll typically see either a black screen or your client to disappear entirely. I suggest working through the steps in our [Mac Connection Guide ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#section-mac)in order to resolve this.\n\nA common workaround for this issue is to spam the **ENTER or RETURN** key after you leave champ select. If this works, it confirms that the core cause of your crashes is a connection problem.\n\nLet me know if this helped.","replies":[]}]}
