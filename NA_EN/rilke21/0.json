Did any Rioter respond to the countless reports of smite being able to kill Trynd, Fizz or Vlad? Or the fact that you see the hp bar of an allied champion drop for all the damage they have taken since you last saw them? Or the countless Azir bugs?\n\nOr the fact that pressing the reconnect button does nothing? Or that some skills are bugged after reconencting?\n\nSome of these issues have been here for months, pressing the reconnect button has been bugged for years.\n\nThen there is Riot support, they will only deal with stuff such as payment gone wrong or needing few RP for something (though both of them are really useful) and some minor things like checking the toxicity/afk stats of your account or how much money you spent on your account.\nEverything else is automated. I reported some bots a month ago, they are all still playing the game without any punishment. You would think a large spam of 5 Soraka bot games when the person never plays Soraka or the support role would be enough proof. But then there is even obvious bot behavior of following somebody around, recalling when they do, running away when targeted by turrets only to run straight into them again because the person they are following did. It's so obvious i really don't believe they are even investigating theira ccount.","replies":[{"poster":"vscAloha","date":"2014-12-07T10:38:03.274+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I should just copy/paste my previous comment here, as nothing I've said has to change for it to still be a valid response.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"ƒæµ","date":"2014-11-29T09:58:07.786+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are some random VU's.

I've also encountered pieces of terrain (on the old Summoner's Rift) that were replaced with the wrong asset as well.\n\nHope this helped!","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Swede","date":"2014-12-03T05:55:50.716+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I used to have this problem but I haven't recently.
