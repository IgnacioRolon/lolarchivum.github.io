I have had no issues logging in since then and haven't been kicked out of the regular client.\r\n\r\nHowever, I went over to the PBE client and typed in my new password and it didn't work. After a few unsuccessful attempts I tried my old password and it worked like a charm. This isn't really a big issue, but I am wondering if the new password should have been updated. \r\n\r\nI know that the PBE is a completely separate account, but I am just wondering if this is expected behavior or a bug. My username on PBE and Regular client are the same \"miniquandt\". I am fine with my PBE account being the old password, I figured I would say something just incase this is a bug.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-23T21:15:18.095+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Working as intended!
