Some one invited  me and I couldnt accept as match join window appeared. So after the match I tried to find him but dont know where to find these invites. Also I have a a hit who is that guy (someone played with him in previous match) but he is not on Recent Played list and can't find him.\r\n\r\nAny idea?\r\n\r\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"IceMyth","date":"2017-08-13T13:40:42.670+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the reply, \n\nSeems either the system auto declined the request (when a popup window for the invitation disappeared)  or he canceled it (if he can) as I cant see anything with friend requests.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-13T22:35:31.025+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You might still be able to find that request in the Notification window as well, but it could also be likely that he canceled the friend request through the add friend button =\\ . You could also check the recently played section, and it's closed by default so try clicking on it and let me know if you still don't see anyone there.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Valeeva","date":"2017-08-13T13:08:09.423+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"On the right hand chat panel, you will see your Clubs and then Friends. The Friends Request button is between them. You should be able to click it if you still have the invite, if not they cancelled it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"IceMyth","date":"2017-08-17T22:38:53.332+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you all, seems it was the case. I was afraid it was a bug as I had issues with my account before after I transfered from EUW to NA but was fixed (I hope :))","replies":[]}]}
