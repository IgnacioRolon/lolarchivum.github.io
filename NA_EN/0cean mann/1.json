The Schedule does say that Pantheon is next in line after Qiyana, however I do suspect that it might be a lil while before he comes to PBE.\n\nIf I had to make a prediction, Pantheon could be ready sometime either before or after Worlds 2019 (between August and September). This is just my guess anyways, he might take longer or he might be released earlier than that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GreenKnight","date":"2019-06-17T14:55:57.060+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Never, i hope","replies":[]}]}
