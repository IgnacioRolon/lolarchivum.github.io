To be ignored and not get any ganks because the jungler is trying to recover from the bad start.\r\n2. To have the jungler feed you lane because they're already on a bad start.\r\n\r\nJust had a game where I was in that exact situation and was raged at because I chose to not feed the enemy laners any more than they already were. I was then told to be reported by both our mid laner and incredibly toxic adc (who later stayed away from all teamfights farming whatever was convenient just because I didn't do what he wanted). Thankfully the enemy team didn't fall for it.\r\n\r\nTL;DR: you don't control the jungler on either team. Learn to adapt.","replies":[]}
