Zileas made plenty of arguments about how certain things are anti-fun. Stuff that you&#039;re putting in for minimal trade off all for the sake of a flashy game.\n\nLet&#039;s start with Tahm and Kalista, two champions who can cause undesired loss of control of your character AS ALLIES. Disregarding the fact Tahm can also do this with enemies, there needs to be a line of communication that most of your player base does not have with each other in order to really make this a more fun mechanic. Since there is not, it can and has often lead to poor plays  and can even 180 your own victory in a fight.\n\nYou&#039;ve also reworked Fiora into such a state where there&#039;s more anti-fun than fun for her enemy. Both can reset the vital zone. Both can maneuver to change access to it. But only Fiora has the spammable dash that gives her an extra tool in playing the game. Let&#039;s not forget that her ultimate further exacerbates the problem by also giving her a large chunk of extra move speed while its primary effect is active.\n\nYou&#039;ve now tossed in a number of items that work far too well with certain champions, and have done nothing to actually correct the problems they present. Key examples are two of your juggernauts, Garen and Darius. Let&#039;s start with the idea that juggernauts, as you stated, should be easily kited. Darius just builds Black Cleaver, and will be able to eternally chase you down as long as he keeps applying the bleed stacks. Garen would just build Deadman&#039;s Plate on top of that, and proceed to kill you quickly with a move speed boost from Q and then being able to use his Judgment to quickly shred you down without much ability to actually stop him even if you push him off.\n\nAnd now we come to mastery choices, particularly the keystones. You had found problems with specific Keystones being too good on select champions. However, instead of nerfing the champions who were the actual problem with those keystones, you instead nerfed the keystones. This act had not only avoided fixing the real problem, but it had also created a new problem where we now have a single dominant keystone because you have nerfed the viability out of the other keystones. In addition, the champions who were problems with those nerfed keystones are still problems. You didn&#039;t solve the actual problem and instead created more problems.\n\nWhat happened Riot?\n\nI feel as if you&#039;ve tossed the lessons you learned previously out the window. Lessons that, when applied, had made your game better than anything else out there.\n\n**TL;DR: **\nIn my opinion, your Late Season 5 and Season 6 changes have been equivalent to Cataclysm expansion for WoW, the expansion that&#039;s well known as the expansion that killed most of the game. I don&#039;t see much chance of you bringing your game back into anything close of the glory that it once was. Blizzard failed at that, but perhaps you may succeed. However, I&#039;m not holding my breath.\n\n**EDIT:**\nThe primary argument I'm making here is that Riot has gone against the good design philosophies. Everything mentioned in this thread is an example of bad but flashy stuff being used over good but simple stuff.","replies":[]}
