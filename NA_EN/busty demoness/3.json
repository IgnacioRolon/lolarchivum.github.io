Top would be two modest triangles, leading up to being tied around the neck with a band all the way around her rib cage.\r\n\r\nParticle/sfx changes would be as follows:\r\n\r\n- Globs of Water for Auto attacks\r\n- Love Tap would become two water drops, angled to look like an upside-down heart. Splash SFX\r\n- Make it Rain would be water drops with a puddle on the ground, with a shower SFX\r\n- Double Up Failure would sound like a low splash or spill\r\n- Strut would use suns instead of hearts\r\n- Bullet Time would use tidal waves, with similar SFX\r\n- Strut Active would make the water tanks glow blue instead of Green.\r\n\r\nPLEASE! This would be a perfect Pool Party skin with a curvaceous humanoid female in a bikini to go along with Lifeguard Sivir!","replies":[{"poster":"Krigjer","date":"2016-06-25T17:55:43.204+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I prefer the summer outfit.
