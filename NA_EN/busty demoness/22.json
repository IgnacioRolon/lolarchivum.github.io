So even if this is intended as 'just a joke' on your end, for the people you're joking about, it's a very VERY serious issue. \n\nNow then, let's move on to a more shocking statistic - the sheer number of women that are unhappy with their appearance. https://metro.co.uk/2016/10/20/three-quarters-of-women-are-unhappy-with-the-way-they-look-6204437/ I've searched through several articles like this and despite the results on this survery stating that over 70% of women are unhappy with how they look, it is actually one of the lowest scores when compared to the others. Other articles claim that potentially 90%+ of women are unhappy with their appearance. However for men, the results seem to suggest that only 20-40% were unhappy with how they look. \n\nAll I'm saying is there's a reason anorexia and other eating disorders are considerably more common in women than in men and the media's focus on women's appearance is believe to be one of the leading causes.\n\nSo maybe instead of making a 'joke' about sexism in video games, educate yourself and realise that there's a real issue going on in today's society that you are contributing to.

With this logic it would be okay for a player to post explicitly racist things in this category and not be published because it was a 'clear joke since it was on the 'memes and games' boards?' \n\nApparently it's sexist to ask for sexy skins for a specific gender or for more sexualized females champions after the past dozen had avoided it. Even Kai'Sa avoided a lot of the potential sexualization and some people still lost their minds when she had a V neck.\n\n> You really don't need a source to realise that a woman with breasts the size of her head, with little to no muscle or fat on her body, would suffer from chronic muscle fatigue if they were to exist in real life. The fact you need a 'credible source' to understand this is laughable.\n\nBiology facts:\n\nMuscles can be strong without being big.\nAll physical attributes can be trained much like the mind can.\nWomen have different bone and muscle structures from men, leading to the average woman being less physically capable than the average man.\nWomen have been shown to have weaker spatial awareness compared to men.\n\nI guess even Biology is sexist, and that's a fact-based science.\n\n> What question? The statement about Kotaku that I never even hinted at bringing up and is a completely separate matter? Yes, my fault for not thinking that was at all relevant to our discussion. Clearly it's me who's the idiot. \n\nYou made the claim that female gamers wanted realistically proportioned and well-written female characters. You did not source this claim and I included several facts that do not support your claim.\n\n> https://www.usnews.com/news/the-report/articles/2017-12-05/study-women-valued-for-physical-attractiveness - This study shows that over a third of women feel that their appearence is what society values most about them. Over a third of women believe that they're physical appearance is more highly valued than their education, intelligence and personality. Do you think video games and other pieces of media portraying women in such sexual ways, even if it's irrelevant to their character, helps this mindset at all? My guess is probably not. So even if this is intended as 'just a joke' on your end, for the people you're joking about, it's a very VERY serious issue. \n\nAll of this is refuted on the idea that games are supposed to break away from reality. There are plenty of people these days claiming that games need forced diversity, forced messages and otherwise need to be a platform for telling people how to think BEFORE being a product of entertainment. Those people are the types who want to control you and deprive you of free will. They don't want you to have fun. They don't want you to leave reality for an hour or two by playing something with a setting completely irrelevant to the real world.\n\nBesides, ever notice how so many games recycle models between males/females? Pretty unrealistic to expect every man/woman within a race to have the exact same body shape (or one of X specific variants) unless you're somehow a VIP in that particular universe.\n\n> Now then, let's move on to a more shocking statistic - the sheer number of women that are unhappy with their appearance. https://metro.co.uk/2016/10/20/three-quarters-of-women-are-unhappy-with-the-way-they-look-6204437/ I've searched through several articles like this and despite the results on this survery stating that over 70% of women are unhappy with how they look, it is actually one of the lowest scores when compared to the others. Other articles claim that potentially 90%+ of women are unhappy with their appearance. However for men, the results seem to suggest that only 20-40% were unhappy with how they look. \n\nAnd we can just as quickly blame media outside of video games. Television shows and Movies generally aren't going to take on newcomers who are unattractive. The older actors get a pass because they've had a history in acting. Advertisements as a whole are also problematic. Right now, I just see you putting all of the blame on video games, where most of it is hand crafted and not based on real people.\n\nWhat bugs me most about that second article is that there is no link to the survey. It just claims it was taken. That comes off as unreliable and therefore does not support your argument.\n\nThis is what I mean by \"source your information\". Kotaku will title their articles to make it sound like some issues are bigger than they really are. Rather than \"I am offended by this thing\" they title it \"Fans are offended by this thing\" and they do that for the purpose of misrepresenting the facts, aka bias and pushing a message. If an article doesn't source where its information came from, it's not something I will immediately trust. All I know on that article is that the survey was taken in Britain and didn't say how many people were surveyed. They didn't even give the agency who did the surveying.\n\n> All I'm saying is there's a reason anorexia and other eating disorders are considerably more common in women than in men and the media's focus on women's appearance is believe to be one of the leading causes.\n\nAgain, Video Games aren't the only media here and Video Games are predominantly played by men. This is not to mean the industry is male dominated, just more popular with men AND THAT'S PERFECTLY FINE.\n\n> So maybe instead of making a 'joke' about sexism in video games, educate yourself and realise that there's a real issue going on in today's society that you are contributing to. Would you make this same joke if you had a daughter or a sister quite literally killing herself because she doesn't believe she is conventionally attractive according to the media's perception of women?\n\nI don't play video games to worry about real world issues. I play video games to entertain/challenge myself. If I'm sexist for that, I'll bear that as a badge of honor.\n\nAlso, there aren't any females who are killing themselves SOLELY over media's perception of women and how they should be portrayed. There's always more to it. It's pretty ignorant to claim that it's solely the fault of media if a female is doing that.\n\nNext time, use a little logic. It will go a long way towards making your arguments for you. I don't want to hear any more from you because it's clear that you're not going to put up anything worthwhile.","replies":[{"poster":"Ulanopo","date":"2019-05-26T12:33:09.763+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":7,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Busty Demoness,realm=NA,application-id=Ir7ZrJjF,discussion-id=sOQwLMkB,comment-id=001a0000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2019-05-26T04:08:31.754+0000)\n>\n> Apparently it's sexist to ask for sexy skins for a specific gender or for more sexualized females champions after the past dozen had avoided it.

The fact you're attempting to use Kai'Sa as an example of a champion lacking in sex appeal in honestly mind boggling. Thought at this point it's quite clear you only look at these champions for their bodies and not their lore. So, I believe before we go any further I need to quickly explain Kai'Sa's lore and why her appearance is so utterly ridiculous - When Kai'Sa was only a child she was trapped inside of the void. The place that Riot's storytelling team are trying to tell us is the single most awful place in all of existence, filled with nightmarish horrors that are breaking through the fabric of reality to bring destruction to absolutely everything. Even being near the place can cause horrific mutations and quite literally cause you to go insane. Kai'Sa spent most of her life inside this place and how does she look like surviving in this place? Well she is a carbon cut out of the very thing we're talking about - big breasted, very slim and absolutely no disfigurements what so ever. Apparently the creature she defeated as a human child and subsequently was moulded to is now strong enough to protect her this completely... Now please tell me what sort of advantage this cleavage gap provides Kai'Sa in a combat situation? The void born abominations are not going to be distracted by her sex appeal. All it does is leave an extremely vulnerable opening around the chest area that is almost guaranteed to get her killed.\n\nNow compare her to a character like Nidalee, whose appearance makes a lot more sense. Her entire outfit is extremely traditional for how we would expect a human living in the jungle would dress. She is essentially female Tarzan in that regards. Though, again, her proportions are \nCOMPLETELY out of whack.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYou're absolutely right! You don't have to be rippling in muscles to be physically strong! But that still doesn't change the fact that the vast majority of these women in League would suffer from chronic back pain, should they exist in real life and I'm sorry to say, but chances are that they'd likely get breast reduction surgery to fix it. \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHere are a couple of articles of women explicitly stating that female video game characters that follow the trope of huge breasts, tiny waists and curvaceous hips is not what they look for in a video game.\n\nhttp://www.pbs.org/kcts/videogamerevolution/impact/women.html\n\nThis one shows some pretty staggering statistics about women in video games as both consumers and characters. For example - 90% of playable characters in video games are men. \n\nhttp://www.womensmediacenter.com/fbomb/the-big-breasted-curse-of-women-in-video-games\n\nBoth of these articles were written by women. \n\nAnd if those aren't enough for you, I did my own little investigation and reached out to some of my friends whom I share a mutual Discord server with and asked them the following question:\n\n** If you had to play as one of the following types of female, which would you choose?**\n\na) a sexualised women, with extremely large, disproportionate breasts, very skinny and massively curvaceous hips despite it having no relevance to their backstory, personality or established lore. \n\nb) an attractive and traditionally 'sexy' appearance, however everything is realistically proportioned and nothing is massively exaggerated to the point where it couldn't possibly exist in real life and everything is relevant to their backstory, personality and established lore.\n\nc) an attractive woman who isn't sexualised at all.\n\nI managed to ask 7 people this question and quite literally all of them answered B or C. With several mentioning how much they straight up did not like A at all. \n\nhttps://gyazo.com/cf5f9e5f105a0e84968a0743d90fb32a\n\nIs all of this too 'click baity' too? \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs I stated above, playable female characters in video game make up around 10% and as also mentioned above women don't seem to enjoy playing as characters so obviously sexualised for no reason other than to fulfill male pleasure then it's obviously quite difficult for them to use these as methods of escaping reality. \n\nHow would you feel if Riot started posting every single male champions' penis size and they were all above 13 inches? What if women then started laughing at YOUR penis for not being the clearly unrealistic penis measurement the champions' had? \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI am not stating anorexia and low self esteem is a result only of video games, it basically is all forms of media and if someone made a similar post to this regarding a different media outlet, I'd be telling them the same thing, but since you're explicitly asking for more sexualised champions in League of Legends, I feel it's most relevant to talk prominently about unnecessary oversexualisation in video games specifically. Heck, since most women don't play video games, this media format is arguably the least problematic. Nonetheless it is still problematic. \n\nI apologise, but I don't understand why you would need a link to the survey? It is no more difficult to fabricate a fake survey than it is to fabricate a fake news article. Hopefully my own survey that I constructed myself is legitimate enough for you. \n\nWhat I find truly fascinating is how you disregard all of the information I'm presenting to you, whilst not bring anything of your own to the table. \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThere is really nothing wrong with having some characters designed for the sole purpose of satisfying a male audience and as the above survey I conducted myself shows, women have no issue with playing as sexual characters so long as they are proportionate and don't forcibly make their sexual regions so drastically unrealistic. Do you not believe that women can be sexy unless they are given bodies so drastically out of proportion that they couldn't possibly exist in real life without suffering from major physical pain. \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYou made an excellent point there. When you play video games you don't want to have to deal with real world issues. So why is it different for women? Why should they have to start up a video game to be greeted by a roster of adult, female characters who are almost entirely comprised of overly sexualised women? Why do they have to log into League of Legends for the first time and instantly be reminded that a large part of the world views them only for their bodies? Not only that, but that the bodies they have aren't good enough for men? Would you be uncomfortable if every male champion walked around with their tesicles hanging out? \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMental illness is an interesting topic as it's almost completely different for each case and scientists have many different theories as to what causes just about all of them. Chemicals in the brain, genetics, the social and economic climate, the media etc. as some of the main forms of what causes them. So whilst it's unlikely that women quite literally starve themselves to death SOLELY because of the media's obsession with being extremely skinny I am confident in saying that if the media promoted a more diverse range of body images then there would be a drop in anorexia cases. \n\nhttps://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/media-eating-disorders\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUse a little logic?

So you'll have to bear with me on some of this.\n\nI didn't say Kai'Sa was LACKING in sex appeal, just that they avoided a lot that they could have done. Congratulations on that reading comprehension. Also, Kai'Sa's lore is outright horrible. It is so Mary Sue that I'm disgusted that it was approved in the first place. She's attractive, sure. But that's it. Her personality is flatter than a sheet of paper and her story makes Miss Fortune's seem well written in comparison despite Miss Fortune being a classic and cliche femme fatale with a thirst for vengeance that will only allow one thing to quench it.\n\nNidalee is also far from out of whack proportions. They are still quite plausible from a realistic standpoint. And guess what, every other League woman falls under that same \"within realistic\" range. MF had actually gotten reductions in her splash art so that she too was within that range.\n\nThe only part that's outright unrealistic is that almost all humanoid League champions are up to those standards. Not just women, but the men as well. The only exceptions that immediately come to mind are Urgot, Sion and Ornn. So perhaps you should expand your complaint to the men of League as well? Or are you somehow fine with one-way sexualization? Because if you are, then that makes you sexist.\n\n----------\n\nThis is where I gotta ask, again, why do real world standards need applied? This is supposed to be a fictional world. If all Marksmen champs have unlimited ammo (with or without reload mechanics), then why is it suddenly too much to ask for body types that are unlikely yet 100% believable?\n\n----------\n\nTierney acts like she's speaking for all women and I don't like that. It sounds like she would decry any female who disagreed with her or didn't like her opinion.\n\nWomen's Media Center acts like game developers were deliberately pushing the envelope of sexism for decades. And that's not just presumptuous, it's biased and narrative pushing.\n\nThe Guardian asks for forced diversity to match the real world. Bias, narrative, an ultimately unrealistic as well because I can guarantee they'd make that complaint in games where it doesn't make sense.\n\nYour survey sample was also 7 females. That's WAY too small to be considered a valid source of information. It's no different from having a poll of 2 options, and knowing 8/10 participants will vote for the same option while claiming it's a country-wide 80% agreement. It doesn't work in terms of \"yes, this is the general opinion\".\n\n----------\n\nI'm going to disregard the first part due to the improperly surveyed nature you're basing it on.\n\nSecond part? Depends on if it matters within the game. Does the game require that measurement for actual gameplay? If not, then it shouldn't. For that reason, women shouldn't have their measurements listed on the same virtue. But on the flip side, these appearances are still generally relevant because of Riot wanting to make sure that characters are easily recognizable for the purpose of \"Gameplay Clarity\". That doesn't mean we get any measurements, but it does help us know what information our brain needs to pull up for a given match.\n\n----------\n\nAnd if you'll actually read, you understand why I'm not simply dismissing your information. I didn't just read the articles. I took into account wording, what was discussed, and how it was discussed. Articles can be both opinion and/or fact based. The worst articles typically do both, often by twisting facts to push that their opinions are the correct ones. I've already pointed out how at least one of those articles pushes for forced diversity.\n\nLike it or not, forced diversity is bad. Because then, no matter how much someone might not fit in, it should be included anyway to meet a quota. Guild Wars Nightfall Expansion had an area where all of the natives were some form of dark skin. This made sense because it was an area heavily saturated by sunlight and desert. It does not make any sense for natives to include those as pale as ghosts even as a minority nor does it make sense to make the population as varied as the United States population.\n\nThis is what it means to use critical thinking. You don't just take people at their word.\n\n----------\n\nThere are two problems with this paragraph that lead me to dismiss it entirely.\n\n1. Sample size of 7 others used as the argument.\n2. You're still pushing for real world standards in a fictional setting.\n\nYou can't seem to separate what's supposed to be fiction from reality. And that is its own disorder. In games where you have characters launching fireballs, throwing ice balls, summoning lightning, summoning gods, and so many other completely unrealistic activities; you somehow still think it's a good idea to ENFORCE realistic standards on bodies.\n\nIf we were to truly have realistic standards across all games, I can guarantee that most of the characters in games would no longer be attractive, no more cool and flashy abilities, no more respawn mechanics, no game saving, and pretty much anything else that can't happen in real life would be prohibited from being featured in a game. At that point, let's go ahead and require that all stories of fiction apply standards that have basis in real world events and no fantasy or futuristic stories can be written ever again.\n\nIf that last paragraph doesn't explain just how absurd your reasoning is, then there's no helping you.\n\n----------\n\nMental health and science are currently pretty new. There's still tons we don't understand about how the human brain works or why certain events trigger different reactions in otherwise very similar individuals. Social and Media climates, while they can influence what happens, are far from being the base factors in why various disorders come up.\n\n----------\n\nI actually think it has been a very fair claim because of your argument \"humanoids must follow real world standards in a fictional world\". If this standard was truly applied, we would lose most comics, many TV shows, fantasy genre, futuristic science fiction genre, super heroes, animated cartoons and so much more because \"human body shape\" wasn't enough.\n\nIn the end, I feel like your argument truly boils down to \"I don't like what you like, therefore you shouldn't have it\". After failing to produce any wide spread studies on \"what female gamers want\" or anything else to substantially back up your claims regarding video games, I don't feel like we will ever come to any sort of agreement on standards outside of \"disagree\".\n\nRather, I should ask \"is it really so bad I enjoy that in my video games?\" Because at no point have I claimed that what I want in my video games is in any way realistic or should be expected in the real world. If you want more realistically proportioned characters, great. You can find plenty of games with that even though I probably won't enjoy them for the same reasons.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
