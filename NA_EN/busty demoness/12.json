At the time we were breeding the fish to harvest them and turn them into an easy to access medicine. The fish is really great at helping with a lot of stuff. It just sucks it isn't more known about because people think it's a joke. \n\nSome of the ingredients in a lot of years-long birth control come from the fish and can be extracted without hurting them.","replies":[{"poster":"Anish22","date":"2019-03-13T10:29:17.735+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"And here I was thinking this was a reference to High School Musical 2{{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-03-13T02:27:51.586+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Busty Demoness,realm=NA,application-id=Ir7ZrJjF,discussion-id=Lo4jKsOh,comment-id=00090000,timestamp=2019-03-13T02:01:22.816+0000)\n>\n> The sad part is that I now want to ask you HOW you know that's an actual fish name.\n\nIt's a popular \"look at the long word I know; it's a Hawaiian fish\" word.
