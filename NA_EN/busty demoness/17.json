Quit giving me &quot;this is gonna happen whether you like it or not&quot; bullshit because that is an easy way to come off as someone going solely off knee-jerk reactions and should generally not be listened to. Especially since you can&#039;t prove it.\r\n\r\nAs to if it actually happens? Look at most natural disasters and how to handle them. You PREPARE with stocking up supplies and having a plan for if/when it hits. You REACT to one by following said plan. You prepare for the worst possible scenario because you never know when it will hit. You pray that it won&#039;t be the worst possible scenario, but you are ready if it is. If it&#039;s not something you can readily prevent, prepare for the possible outcomes. Do not act like you can see the future and stop using doomsday prophecies as your primary argument tool, it makes you look extremely stupid.\r\n\r\nRight now, most of what I&#039;m seeing is reaction. And it amounts to running around like a decapitated chicken. It is embarrassing to see so many people act like it&#039;s suddenly the end of the world wide web just because the USA repealed a portion of law. Do one better than the headless chicken. Create a plan regarding the worst possible situation and work from there. That means any and all contingencies. If that means starting up a petition now to send to president Trump upon the final repeal of NN, get started and rack up those e-signatures. If that means writing many detailed, emotional letters to various members of congress/senate, get started on a good one for your template.\r\n\r\nThe point is to stop panicking and start planning your next move. Even a zombie apocalypse has a general plan you can use to increase your odds of survival. You wouldn&#039;t get far in most disasters running in circles screaming and flailing about. So stop the crazy and get ready for what you think is the worst possible situation to come.","replies":[]}
