I did really well; I only missed a few Groups teams and one first round Knock-out stage team. I think I got like 96 points or something.\nThis year, I'm sitting at thirty, with a maximum possible of 85 if I get all my other Knock-out stage picks right.\nThis has inspired me to do a random Pick'Em next year.

In the case of ties, I will roll again for both teams to see which team gets higher.\nGroup 2: Will use a spinner divided up into quarters, one quarter for each team. First team I spin wins the group, next team gets second, etc. If I spin a team I already got, I'll spin again.\nGroup 3: Will get playing card deck and shuffle. First, I'll assign teams to their respective suits by choosing a team then drawing a card until I get a suit that has not been taken yet. Then I'll reshuffle the deck and draw the first card. That team wins. Next suit that I draw that was not previously drawn gets second, etc. If I draw a joker, the EU team (if there is one) goes last automatically and all teams are moved up one spot if possible.\nGroup 4: Will trust my gut and do an actual Pick'Em for this.\n\nExceptions:\n1. SKT gets first.\n2. For the two Wildcard teams, I will choose one as heads and one as tails, then flip a coin. The one that gets flipped is placed normally in its group, the other gets automatically put in fourth in its group. If the losing Wildcard is with the EU team that drew a joker, the Wildcard gets third instead.\n3. If it happens that no NA team is in first or second for any group, I am allowed to use another spinner split into quarters. One quarter will be empty, the others will have the NA teams. If it lands on a NA team, I move that NA team up to second and move the displaced teams down. Otherwise, no NA team moves up.\n4. Team Liquid (overrides EU joker and Wildcard coin flip loser, is not a candidate for exception #3)\n\n---\n\nKnockout 1-1: Will trust gut and do actual Pick'Em.\nKnockout 1-2: Will assign teams to sides of a coin and flip coin.

If there is no EU team, I choose who wins and who loses.\nKnockout 1-4: Will trust gut and do actual Pick'Em.\n\nKnockout 2-1: Will trust gut and do actual Pick'Em.\nKnockout 2-2: Will trust gut and do actual Pick'Em.\n\nKnockout 3-1: SKT\n\nExceptions:\n1.
