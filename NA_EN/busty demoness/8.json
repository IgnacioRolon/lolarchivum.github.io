However, the execution was sexist to both genders; men were outright excluded and women were prioritized for being women rather than being more qualified. Sexism doesn&#039;t solve sexism, it simply trades one version for another (also goes for racism).\r\n\r\nBoth genders being able to choose whatever field they want to be in without judgment is true equal opportunity. Sadly, we haven&#039;t quite gotten rid of the judgment part yet. Plenty of initiatives to encourage people to make the CHOICE to enter a field their gender may not find as popular is what we need to do, not prioritize based on minority. It&#039;s okay to have a massive gender imbalance, and a gender imbalance doesn&#039;t need fixed as long as the field is open to all. The important part is that anyone who truly wants to be in that field is allowed to strive to be better than their peers and get that employment based on their merit and efforts rather than random factors.\r\n\r\nThat equal opportunity, where you are not denied choices based on some factor you had zero control over, is what true feminism/black rights was about. We don&#039;t need to give favors to the minority population, we simply need to encourage them to do better.\r\n\r\nDo not let people say &quot;sexism/racism can&#039;t happen against those in power/majority&quot;, for all it does is twist the definition so they may use false generosity to gain favor.","replies":[]}
