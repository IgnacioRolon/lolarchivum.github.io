However, that&#x27;s the formula I&#x27;m using for this particular argument against Youmuu&#x27;s efficiency.\n\nThat's not how this works at all...\nWhen you purchase an item with base stats (i.e. what you're referencing gold value off of) you get those stats PERMANENTLY (or at least until you sell the item). You can't give the same gold value to stats you get from an item active, ESPECIALLY the same gold value PER SECOND. \n\nYou CAN say that the item active is worth 1790 gold when active. Which basically means that Youmuu's gold value is:\n3166.67 when not active\n4956.67 when active\n\nNow, you make a valid point about comparing item actives - obviously since the bonus is temporary you need to factor in how long they last. You do this very wrong though. Inevitably temporary stats are worth less than permanent stats, so how are you assigning a permanent value to each second the item is active? Then doubling it because of how often it's active?\n\nYou asked for a better option. I'll put one here, but it will STILL be incorrect. It will overvalue the active since (as you admitted) the item will never achieve perfect efficiency, you'll inevitably not use the active whenever it's up (nor will you fully use the active when you activate it, as you may get the kill/turret before the stats wear off, or you may only need the MS or only the AS and not both when you use it). It will also undervalue the active because there's plenty of time where the cooldown is ticking while you don't need the stats (although MS is always useful, so this undervaluing component is only really on the AS). \n\nAnyways, how you could value it:\nPermanent value: 3166.67\nActive value: 1790\nActive duration: 6 seconds\nActive cooldown: 45 seconds\nActive percentage: 6/45 = 2/15 = 13.33%\nTotal value = 3166.67 + 1790 * 0.1333 = 3405.22\n\nSo Youmuu's costs 3200 gold. It's 99% gold efficient without the active, and 154.9% gold efficient while the active is used, averaging out to 106.41% gold efficient in total.\n\nIn contrast, almost any top tier item without an active (ranging from the 2600 zeal items to the 3000+ items) will be around 110-120% gold efficient. So it's actually pretty balanced overall - you're sacrificing permanent efficiency for the ability to temporarily gain a power spike.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"IS3E531E3F964391","date":"2016-07-30T07:19:07.198+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think another problem is it's low cooldown, you don't have to think ''hmm should I use it now or save it for a team fight which might happen in a minute'' because by then it's already up again","replies":[{"poster":"Volcanuz","date":"2016-07-30T11:11:46.227+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Not really. The thing is most times you won't even be able to activate it, like in a gank on you. Or even when ganking, even if you activate it a Exaust can destroy the active and get you killed. People see or use it as a IWIN button but it isn't. It only helps people who auto or need A LITTLE MORE gap closing. Like take Panth for instance. \n\nI buy it on my panth as his first item. I get it really early in game, like super fast. But i don't use it much. Panth has a gap close (W) and he has a stun attached to it, he only autos tops 2-3 times in a 1v1. In a group fight by the time his combo is done, he is dead or the team have finished them off. So the AS right away goes out the window. Then you have the move speed, it isn't super crazy high, it is % based so if your move speed is a small amount it will only affect it a small amount. Also it is only 20% which there are many items better at bumping your speed. \n\nSo in the end on Panth i use the active ONLY if i am helping kill baron or dragon, or think it could help me catch a champ, which it doesn't, if they have even 30 more MS then i have they are long gone even with the active on as i only gain 30 or so MS with base and 32 or so with boots. \n\nSure there are champions where the active works wonders!! But the thing is it just isn't viable enough for them to buy, most times if you see youmuu in someones build, it is someone who relies on their skills to kill and not on auto attacking or movement speed and only use it on towers or objectives as i said. \n\nSO I DOUBT they use it ALL THE TIME.

It sounds like you are talking about decision making? \n\nBork I can see is conditional upon the enemy being in range. The output of that active is also conditional on the enemy. Which leads to the variance.\n\nZhonya's has no conditional that I can see (which is why I'd like you to clarify what you mean). It can be used any time and the output is the same. A 2 second statis. The variance in Zhonyas comes not in the conditionality of it, but the decision making. _When_ do I use it. Even though the statis output is the same the value of that varies because it might prevent a huge amount of damage, it may prevent nothing. \n\nSo to me, Ghostblade has no conditionals because it can be used whenever, wherever and however. It has a huge amount of variance in the output in terms of damage (similar to bork) even though there is no variance in the stats gained. If you were talking about decision making, I'd agree it's fairly low with Ghostblade. Even though there is a huge amount of variance provided depending on _when_ it's used, there isn't a great deal of tension or decision making that I would say is present in Zhonyas. \n\n>t's the active that makes it so valuable for an ADC.

If you didn't need the movespeed for dodging during that time, then it plays more like 667 gold value for that time period.\n\nThe average max value is still going to approach but not actually reach 238 gold due to not popping it on cooldown.\n\nAnd if you're caught out while it's on cooldown, you get it for 0 seconds of that interaction, and get 0 gold value during that.\n\nHow you use the item is extremely relevant to the value of it, because if you're consistently layering that 6 seconds over short interactions when they matter most, you get a lot of value out of it. Obviously very good players are going to tend to maximize the use of it.\n\nThe active isn't why it's bought though, it's that the general stats are nice. Penetration is a geometric scalar like other auto attack related stats. If the enemy has like, 100 armor, then you're getting 11% more damage out of all of your physical damage due to the 20 ArPen. (100+100)/(100+100-20) = 1.111ish.  If they have 60 armor, its (100+60)/(100+60-20) = 1.14ish, for 14% more. That'll range from 16-13% on turrets too, which crit doesn't work on, due to turrets now ranging from 40 to 70 armor throughout the game.\n\nAn I.E. costs more, and it's bonus only adds to autoattacks. The average value it adds being 30% to autos only, and is very erratic early. (0.2 * 1.5)= 0.3, for 30% more average auto damage. That'll pop to a harder spike with a zeal item, but when early trades are dominated by ability use, and the ArPen still scales multiplicatively with the crit you build later, Youmuu's is obviously pretty efficient. It's cheaper, so you spike earlier, and you're more consistent. It's a good lane winner, and has a friendly build path.\n\nThe comparison's still wonky since B.F. into Zeal item into I.E.'s been more effective than straight I.E. for a while, but the point remains. Youmuu's active is gravy. Armor rushers are the only ones that'd make the Youmuu sub-par, and they don't make up that much of the enemy team. And I.E.'s reliance on a 2-item spike is rough with the early game focus.\n\nThis mostly applies to the ADCS, but AD casters mesh even more naturally with the ability scaling Youmuu's gives.

Penetration is very nice (especially with the tower armour from a few patches ago), but I don't think ghost blade would be bought without it's active (at least not on ADC's). A lot of fights are won and lost in 6 seconds. That extra 'spell' that the active provides can contribute a reasonable amount to fights for auto attackers.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Brimaz The King","date":"2016-07-30T14:57:17.761+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's the number one bought item in dimound plus ranks","replies":[{"poster":"BloodyTompon","date":"2016-07-31T01:43:25.846+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Does it trump these?\n{{item:1001}} {{item:2003}} {{item:3649}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Virgin Ray","date":"2016-07-30T05:12:01.020+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"https://66.media.tumblr.com/97e7d177c76e0d545de3f4d972a05001/tumblr_nki94ic8K11ta2n54o1_500.gif","replies":[]},{"poster":"MaeDoSan","date":"2016-07-30T04:34:17.583+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nice math","replies":[]},{"poster":"FrodoBagginses","date":"2016-07-30T14:39:48.408+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"{{item:3140}} This item's active is worth more than any other in the game.
