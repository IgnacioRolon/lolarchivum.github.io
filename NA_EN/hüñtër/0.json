If possible, it would be great if a Riot employee could spectate the game to see what this player is doing.

We've got a similar note up on the service status page at http://status.leagueoflegends.com/?en_US#na.  You can also report this person to player support at https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new.  \n\nIt's definitely a shitty exploit, and we're getting it fixed ASAP.","replies":[{"poster":"Dies to Wolves","date":"2014-11-13T21:41:47.403+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hey, can you guys add a function to report for cheat/hack/abuse/script or something like that in game? was recently watching a streamer for example who was playing against a very obvious streamer. In the end he was going to report him, but since the only report options are fur stuff like griefing / negative attitude / etc, he didn't report him. some people really don't like the hassle of tickets or have had bad experiences with player support (automated responses for very specific cases, for example) and end up not reporting cheaters.\n\nthis could also alleviate the issue of people posting on the forums about those abuses (a lot of people believe that this is the correct place to report such cases), which could reduce awareness  of the exploit (and as such, less people potentially trying to find out how to do the exploit)","replies":[]}]}]}
