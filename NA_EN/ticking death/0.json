I never play games on TT (mainly enjoy ARAM or an occasional team builder), but when I saw the kinds of changes Riot was making to the map, I got pretty excited. I wanted to try out a couple of games, but soon found out that my enemy team was just a bunch of sub-bar bots. Not one, or even two. But all three were IP farming bots. And this happened in my second game too. One of my teammates told me this was really common practice for the map. It destroys all the fun in the game. It's not worth winning if you don't have to try for it. \n\n\nIs Riot doing anything to address this issue? Would appreciate it if a Rioter could give some insight into this.","replies":[{"poster":"ShÃ¯ren","date":"2015-06-10T22:00:02.964+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"All this talk of bots and I have yet to ever see one in TT.

It's very much been a thorn in my side and others.  I think it's great if you haven't encountered them, but I bet if you had to start over and be forced to slug through them for a couple of months you'd have a different attitude.  That is if it really is tied to MMR...I'm hoping so for my own sanity.  I noticed some posts indicating it could be timezone/player population related..ie I'm on late night US typically and there are just less humans playing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"poodoo","date":"2015-06-13T20:04:30.344+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bots are affecting everyone","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ticking Death","date":"2015-06-11T20:01:56.293+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sure, those things could solve the problem, but it doesn't fix the fact that people sell these accounts for money or that players have to waste time dealing with bots before they can get an actual match, wherein they can practice the map before going to ranked.
