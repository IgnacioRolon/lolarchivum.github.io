They literally give up before the game gets going and start throwing themselves at the enemy and practically spoon feeding kills to the enemies. Now I know it's fair game that every team can have those, but lately I feel if I screw up and make any mistake I can't do anything for my team because they're worse off than me, on the other hand my enemies seem to pick up on even one mistake. I feel the odds against me, I'm slowly climbing, but there's always these types of games to derail me, what should I do, what can be done.","replies":[{"poster":"DexterousGecko","date":"2014-10-26T06:24:32.146+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hmm, i was thinking about the whole \"no one can adc in silver\" thing. It also seems like no one in Silver or Bronze knows how to protect an adc either. I always see silver and bronze people just chasing kills, ignoring the guy jumping on their adc, etc. It's more like no one really knows what top, mid, adc, support and jungle are even supposed to really do at my skill level.","replies":[{"poster":"StOrmysLIVE","date":"2014-10-26T10:17:39.040+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the biggest issue for botlane in silver is no one ever wants to be support (probably because they suck at supporting, which is one of the hardest roles to play).\n\nevery lane chases kills, but bot lane is affected more because theres 2 people instead of one, so the chances for a mistake to happen is a lot higher down there.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TehomCD","date":"2014-10-26T07:39:39.615+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Games always feel like they're a tossup when you're basically being matched against people who are the same skill level as you or a bit below. Games can usually be easy or hard based on champ select, where people might happen to get the roles they want while the other team has a bunch of people who could really only play one role well and get forced onto things they're bad at, or whether bans just happen to take away someone's best champion while something strong gets through that someone is good at. Then you throw in more random factors like someone who decides to troll, random 4v5s or 3v5s based on internet problems, and more, and it might seem like a lot of games are completely out of your hands - which is true if you aren't so much better than the people you're matched against that you can win games that are completely stacked against you. So the only long-term path to victory is just getting better enough where you can start to win in horribly unlucky situations.\n\nUltimately the only thing you can control is yourself, so it's just practical to focus on self-improvement and learning from any mistakes you made, even if they weren't really relevant in that specific game's outcome.","replies":[]},{"poster":"UnicornPurple","date":"2014-10-26T06:17:10.134+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"duo queue helps a lot.\n\nif you and the other person have good synergy it feels like easy mode, lol.\n\ni got stuck at silver 3 for a second, had a good game with our support, he added me to his friends list and we both were gold 5 within a matter of days with very few games that felt like we couldn't easily carry.","replies":[]},{"poster":"God Mode Enabled","date":"2014-10-26T06:16:04.544+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"always pick vayne, learn how to use her ult / roll combo right to push people, learn how to use her E properly\n\nsit back and laugh your way to plat\n\nup to plat, no one knows how to handle good vayne players... no one","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chewbacca Merkin","date":"2014-10-26T03:52:30.599+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yorick isnt a late game champ, and its easy to farm on ziggs.
