My first suggestion would be to see if clearing your browser [**history and cookies**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752694-Clearing-Browser-History-and-Cookies) helps out. \n\nSince you've already tried that, let's see if you're able to get the PBE signup page to work in a different browser.","replies":[{"poster":"ricebunniesben2","date":"2017-03-26T16:06:32.079+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok. I just checked with my friends and they also said that the website shows that they have been accepted even though they didn't send an application in.

They may have received that email unintentionally, but we can always double check if they reach out to us.\n\nIf you still can't get onto the website to sign up, reach out to us in a [ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) so we can look into your issue one on one.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ricebunniesben2","date":"2017-03-26T15:54:34.651+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"what does clearing your history and cookies do anyways?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-03-26T20:16:40.949+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When you try to pull up a website that stores data for future use, it'll store that data as a 'cookie'.
