The first one I had I was using almost 2 years. Then I started playing League actively and soon it stopped working. All 4 laptops that followed have been in 3-4 reclamations before I just threw them away and bought another one. All the same. Different brands (Lenovo, MSI, one which I can&#039;t remember). This year with my 5th one I didn&#039;t play League much. More didn&#039;t than did. Last month I got into it again and started playing more actively. And guess what. This is the fourth time it froze and I had to restart in the middle of the game - after what, 4 months of no problems.\nThe conclusion is clear: League is destroying my computers. No, I&#039;m not hitting it when I get tilted. It&#039;s just from playing the game often.\n\nAny help? I&#039;m desperate, I&#039;ll actually do anything.","replies":[]}
