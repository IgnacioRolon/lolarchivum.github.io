Unfortunately, it only alerts her teammates you are about to be CCed and it&#039;s easy to prepare skillhots for them. Also unfortunately alongside with the short cooldown of Paddle Star it just gives Zoe more time for Q to come back up so she can zone you with one Q into easy E and kill you with the next one. Also unfortunately you are slowed and the delay is so short you will not be able to reposition anyway without a mobility spell and that obviously doesn&#039;t do anything for the enemy.\n\n* #Paddle Star being a narrow skillshot + required to be streched from behind\nThe skillshot actually is narrow and that would make for a good counterplay. Unfortunately, Zoe&#039;s sparkly theme makes it so a narrow skillshot will always be hard to see, almost invisible, which doesn&#039;t help the enemy. Combined with her having to throw it behind her which telegraphs the damage, that would have made for a skill interaction. Unfortunately, the first cast will go into the Fog of War most of the time and her Q animation is not very distinct from her normal twirling, so it only makes it hard for the enemy to predict where it&#039;s going to come from. Not to mention it can be thrown around the creeps so covering behind the creeps is less of an option, not the point of this post though.\n\n* #Her ultimate will always bring her back to the casting location\nThis helps the enemy to know where to line up their skilshots for a guaranteed hit. The problem is Zoe will never (unless she seriously messes up her positioning which would be her fault you can&#039;t set up for) cast her ultimate in the range of your skillshot - she will rather jump from outside of your range into it to get herself in range of her own spells. Considering ranges, this is extremely effective against all but ~3 champions. This unfortunately means Zoe will always get back to safety no matter what she gets hit with while in the range.\n\n* #Don&#039;t use your summoner spells to avoid granting Zoe Spellthief procs\nThis one is one of the more obvious: Unfortunately, while this is the form of counterplay that is purely onto you, both scenarios (following it or not) put you in a serious disadvantage. Zoe will always have two more usable summoner spells than you (note: while not sacrificing anything kit-wise compared to other similar working characters). \n\nThese are the mechanics you might not seem on the first sight and which are, in my opinion, mainly what makes her so frustrating to play against, because basically her whole kit acts like &quot;this is the counterplay&quot; while either doing nothing for the person playing against Zoe or even screwing them even more. \nI really hope Rioters can get their hand on this and consider addressing these issues (preferably by reworking the whole kit&#039;s function **or**/and purpose). Frankly, Spellthief is one of the spells that seem cool and all but don&#039;t have place in a game like this, it won&#039;t be healthy even when scrapped to it&#039;s basic form of *only* stealing champions&#039; spells and nothing else because that&#039;s exactly what makes it toxic (even when probably weak in that state).\n\nThanks for your attention.","replies":[{"poster":"Kai Guy","date":"2018-11-14T09:34:32.732+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't have nice things to stay in response to your statements.

If your comments are OMG NERF THIS TO GROUND! That does not mean its current iteration is a positive. \nIf you make it work on the same power scale like you just keep same # and just simplify things? You only can buff the champion you gigantic fool.   \n\nTLDR. Comlicated does not mean overloaded. The more variables the less you see best case usage. That's how it all works.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         1)Hard CC instantly on E is better? Yes it is so then No its not a freaking nerf. Look in any tier of play where your teammates are not shit you can expect them to chain CC. The delay makes it weaker and enables more counter play then instant CC. Look  Its just a better ability in any situation your allies are not garbage + in ever situation your alone. Instant CC on E makes her stronger in lane, Makes her able to do some stupid QREQ burst patterns.  Making it so E instantly applys sleep only hurts lower elo. She has more survivability to ganks, more options in lane.  unless incompitant teammates blow her sleep its never a bad thing. Also sleeping folks are still really fucking easy to CC. You just point on them and cast CC. That's it, nothing else is required.  So options 1. Gut her E, 2. It cant be instant CC with out it buffing her.   If you want to sit here and tell me that you can not possibly use E moe effectively in lane on an instant application All I can say is your a trash zoe don't play her.\n\n2 ) first off, AUDIO QUES ARE A THING. Following that, what's a better option. Go the route of old nid Insta gibbing folks from fog? look the requirement to cast backwards and/or put additional abilitys (have to use E or R for set up) onto CD is always weaker then a single use ability that's not interactive with the rest of her kit.  No seriously name one universe where back casting  MAKES IT STRONGER. Im waiting.... Like if its just a skill shot 1 cast ability?   Gee golly gosh I do think I could just relocate with R to line the shot up, fog of war stills gonna be a threat. Change it to have a bigger hit box. Hell make it a single cast skill shot, it only gets BETTER. \nLook I was around for old ap nid days and if you think zoe Q is superior your so freaking wrong I want to slap you magically thru your god dam monitor.  The hell you want out of a skill shot  out of fog of war. Lets use this to poke holes in your \"Drowsy delay for repositioning\"  Kudos dog, her Q is EVEN STRONGER if there  is not delay. E Q  dead. Fog of war with 0 counter play. E lands you walk back cast Q, Or E lands you R then Q.  \n\nUnless your demanding a nerf to the damage and scaling, or the distance of her Q making it single cast  or bigger hit box is not a fucking nerf why the hell would you claim otherwise?  If your asking for an ability to be gutted or nerfed just say exactly that. \n\n3) Its clear that you seem to have a Garbage undersanting of zoe range, so I guess its  no wonder you hate this champion.  If your bad at keeping vision and hate to ward, or you lack a basic undersanding of summnors rift and areas your going to be threatend by a 800 range ability fine I grant you Zoe will be a frustration But Like dog, you cant even caculate the # of folks who have over 800 range?  {{champion:103}}  Does it on Q and E. {{champion:22}}  Volly outranges zoe, much less R being global. {{champion:1}}  R due to AOE out ranges Zoe. {{champion:32}}  Q out ranges. Theres 3 champions that out range zoe and I don't even have to leave the A's in the champion rooster for that shit.   Look zoe R MOVES HER INTO DANGER SHE CANT CAST OUTSIDE OF 800 UNITS MAX.   Bitch all you want but at no point is her 575  cast range on R going to make her hit units 800 units away from her hit boxes.... and also just to call you out more SHE WOULD ONLY GET BETTER IF E INSTANTLY CCED. R hanycap is that it fucking cant excape, and locks her out of movement.\n\n4) You have to suck if you only use summoners defensively. Zoe gets shit if you happen to say {{summoner:4}}  Then {{summoner:14}}  And kill her with it.  How the hell you gonna sit here and tell players OMG DONT SS ZOE!   when you can use most SS agressivly and she cant pick them up?     you wanna say 100% of the time you cant use SS vs her? well then I guess 100% of the time she has to be kicking your ass. Tell me more about how Zoe managed to use {{summoner:13}} {{summoner:1}} {{summoner:21}} {{summoner:14}} {{summoner:3}}  when your going aggro and she has to back but some how she killed you with your own SS.    \n\n\n\nYou want to make Zoe Braindead with out nerfing her #s to shit?   You make her broken. You want her to become braindead and also get nerfed to garbage tier?  Why bother with this post just be like other folks and Demand riot removes her.  Awfull logic here and you don't show any understanding of the game state man. Gross.\n\n\nNothing personal, sorry for profanity. Just... Yuck man. Don't bitch about counterplay when its removal can only be a buff. Account for what required balance changes or nerfs will be required. You cant call weaknesses strong with out accounting for the fact IT ONLY EVER GETS STRONGER WHEN SIMPLIFIED OR BUFFED BRAH!!!111one!!!!superimportiantstuff!!1111!!!!!\n\nSeriously, call me out if I am wrong anywhere.

The idea was that being around a Zoe would give people a terrible experience, making them so angry and frustrated that they continue to have strong feelings about the game. The fact that those feelings are negative is of no concern to Riot. They just want people to stay addicted.","replies":[{"poster":"Kai Guy","date":"2018-11-15T03:51:40.173+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Humm.

The part about the ult was kind of a wash, as Zoe's primary purpose for ulting is more range/damage on Q. If she's going to be out of range most of the time anyway, it's basically just a higher Q mana cost. It doesn't really end up helping her instead of her opponents; it just isn't as big of a drawback as it ~~was~~ _wasn't_ supposed to be.\n\nThat said, I think it bears repeating that Riot designed and released a champ that made the game worse just to keep people addicted via their rage. Do you think that's ethical? I don't.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Evil Bisex Plant","date":"2018-11-14T09:41:06.583+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"If it's not nice it's also not true because this is exactly what Zoe does.
