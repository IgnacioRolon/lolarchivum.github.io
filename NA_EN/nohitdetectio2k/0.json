Getting cursed out and reported for having a bad game or two.  Especially ranked, i fear playing jg ranked because even if you hit every lane in an attempt to be in the game, you&#039;ll be a victim of all caps from someone.

It's what I do. I have bot lane rage at me all the time because if you are slamming your lane under their own turret while they are full hp and you are half and you don't ward. Hell no I'm not coming down there. I'm going to the two lanes that are easy to gank and have the oppurtunity to take turret right after. \n\nMy common thing I hear from bot lane is, \"You have no presense! You don't gank at all!!!!!\" MEanwhile scoreline is most of the time in the range of 3-1-2. Top turret gone. And rotations starting.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Karfuss","date":"2017-04-16T04:18:36.431+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Jungle is the absolute worst role for avoiding flame.\n\nBot lane is 0/5?

I dont consider myself a good jg, heck I only play irelia jg and Im mediocre, but it is not just the jg responsibility to be in a lane at all times. People forget you need to farm also. On top of them bot lane has the biggest possibility of surviving ganks since there are two people. \n\nI think people just need to actually try more than two lanes and three characters to know what to expect.
