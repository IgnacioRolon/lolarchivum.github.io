RIOT, please respond so I can play.","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, it seems to be official. Patch 4.21 has snapped my league client in half. As of yesterday, I was able to play, no problem. However, today I tried to start league and it doesn't work at all - it opens the logo for a second, the logo disappears, it reappears with a bar underneath it (like it was going to patch), then disappears. \n\nLooking at the task manager, I can see that lolpatcher and RADS kernel started but they force close themselves after 10-15 seconds. I'm about ready to give up and start playing DOTA at this point, I have spent almost 4 hours trying to fix this using various guides.\n\nHere's a list of what I have tried:\n-Disabling firewall\n-Disabling antivirus\n-Replacing the RADS kernel with a new one from Riot\n-Giving all permissions to league related applications\n-Manually installing new ADOBE AIR and Directx 9\n-Uninstalling league --> disk cleanup --> reinstalling (4 or 5 times)\n-Windows updates\n-Run as admin\n-Disabling UAC\n-Checking active scripting (it was on)\nEDIT: added more above\n\nNOTHING works at all. I have no idea what happened but this patch completely disables my ability to play. What's really weird is that I only have lol patcher and lol launcher subfolders in my RADS project folder - not AIR client or game client files, so these aren't being downloaded by the patcher, though they should be.\n\nI've seen several posts of this nature since 4.21 in the help and support forum. This is the first time I have ever posted on the forums, since I've never been so frustrated by LOL. Can we please get a RIOT response to this soon, since I would like to play my favorite game?\n\nBIG EDIT: I got the game to finally work. It turns out when I changed the hosts file, I didn't change it properly (mistyped the localhost number). It seems to be working now, thank goodness.","replies":[{"poster":"UstYdTta7F","date":"2014-12-11T02:07:53.424+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"1) Go to C:\\Windows\\system32\\drivers\\etc\n2) Open \"host\" file\n\nMake sure your localhost is 127.0.0.1\n\nIf you have anything else below that, it's the issue that is preventing the patcher from opening and closing out automatically.

I had this issue myself with a second install I have of LoL. After closing and re-opening it a few times, Windows Firewall eventually popped up and asked me do I want to allow it through. I assume something has changed with how it patches which makes all older firewall rules obsolete.\n\nMy first suggestion would be to do the same thing as above, just keep trying to launch it until, hopefully, Windows Firewall pops up as mine did. Then just allow it through the network.\n\nIf this doesn't work: if you already have LoL added to your firewall exceptions list, I advise deleting the rules and readding them.\n\nIf you don't think you use a firewall or just use the standard windows firewall, please follow these steps:\n\n- Go to Start and search for \"Windows Firewall\"\n- Open up Windows Firewall, and to the left select \"Allow an app or feature through Windows Firewall\"\n- Click the \"Change Settings\" button at the top right here\n- Scroll down and select any existing LoL rules, and \"REMOVE\" them\n- Once complete, go to \"Allow another app...\" at the bottom\n- In the window that pops up, go to \"Browse...\"\n- Go to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends and add lol.launcher.exe\n- Do the same with lol.launcher.admin.exe\n- Do the same with C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\RADS\\system\\RADS_USER_KERNEL.exe\n\nOnce done, try launching LoL again, and see if it makes any difference.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zalzalaar","date":"2014-12-11T08:48:32.273+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had this too and I managed to launch the launcher by starting:\nRiot Games\\League of Legends\\RADS\\projects\\lol_launcher\\releases\\{Latest Version}\\deploy\\LoLLauncher.exe\n\nHope that works for you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"D0nC","date":"2014-12-11T02:20:32.202+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"My fix was easy.\n\nRestarted and then disabled both firewalls windows and Avast, hooked the PC straight into the modem with no router and voila.\n\nYou apparently need to restart before disabling FW.","replies":[]}]}
