Those who don't know, I have been permabanned on an account I have spent much, much money on. It's made me thoroughly depressed and what not. I am making a strong effort for a reversal of the ban. Here are the messages between me, and a player behavior specialist. Note, they are still on going and I will update the thread frequently.\r\n\r\nI was permabanned for abusing an exploit. I have truly, truly reformed. Here are the messages:\r\n\r\n\" I made a grave mistake and I regret it so much.\r\n\r\nI am a huge fan of League of Legends. I absolutely LOVE the game. I had been playing for 3 years, until I was recently banned for using an Ashe exploit in two ranked games.\r\n\r\nI had a total of 51 skins, and only missing 1 champion. I have spent a ATLEAST $400 on the account, and I miss it so dearly. I am SO sorry about what I did and I deserve my punishment. I have reformed since then, and I would never abuse a known exploit ever again. I've become depressed as of the last three weeks because League of Legends was basically the only fun I have. I miss playing the game so much.\r\n\r\nI love what you guys at Riot are doing, and I supported you guys by throwing all my money at your wonderful skins and well designed champions. I would be so grateful if my permaban could be lifted. I am truly sorry for those who experience I ruined during the two games I abused the exploit.\r\n\r\nIf I can't get it lifted, is there anyway I can get the skins and champions transferred onto another account of mine? I am really sad and I am so desperate.\r\n\r\nRiot, please make an exception for me. I love your game and am having trouble without it. Please consider this request... thank you so much.. \"\r\n\r\n- Me.\r\n\r\n\r\n Hello Summoner,\r\n\r\nOur systems detected the use of modifications within your client that gave you a competitive advantage over others. Improper modifications to your League of Legends client are against the Terms of Use and are a suspendable offense. We believe that all players should play on an equal field in an effort to maintain fair and competitive sportsmanship.\r\n\r\nI hope you can see that it would be unsatisfying and frustrating to play against other players who are using a tool to gain an unfair advantage. The actions we have taken have been to protect the fairness and integrity of the Fields of Justice.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nSirAaru\r\nThe Grandmaster Explorer of Piltover \r\n\r\n- Riot automated message.\r\n\r\nI understand that, but why not give me a second chance? Considering all the money I spent on the account, please show some mercy. I've learned from my mistakes. Shouldn't that be the only thing that matters? I've reformed. I will never chat again... please. I'm begging to be unbanned.\r\n\r\n- Me.\r\n\r\n\r\nello Summoner,\r\n\r\nI understand you have concerns and Iâ€™m sorry I am not able to address them at this time. We have a Player Behavior Team in place dedicated to working with these requests, so I need to transfer your ticket. A Player Behavior Specialist will be contacting you shortly.\r\n\r\nThank you for your patience.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nSirAaru\r\nThe Grandmaster Explorer of Piltover \r\n\r\n- Me being transferred to an actual human being\r\n\r\n Thank you so much. I really hope the Player Specialist sees some mercy. I hope to be unbanned... I am truly deeply sorry. I made a huge mistake and will never do it again. I am sincere.  \r\n\r\n- Me\r\n\r\nI appreciate you reaching out about your permanent suspension and admire your honesty and apology. Since we've discovered that your account used exploits or 3rd party programs to create an unfair advantage for you over others, which is against our Terms of Use and a very serious offense, your permanent suspension is not up for discussion and won't be modified or lifted. \r\n\r\n- Riot Support Specialist\r\n\r\n\r\nI tried atleast. Thank you very much for the reply! I greatly appreciate it.\r\nIs there anyway I can get the current IP and RP from that account traded to my current account? I understand why I can't be unbanned, but I've seen people been able to have stuff transferred from the permabanned account to another. Is there anyway I can do this? \r\n\r\n- Me\r\n\r\n\r\nou are very welcome for the reply. As for transferring your IP and RP, I'm sorry, but I'm not able to transfer content between one account and another. Let me know if there's anything else I can help you with.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\n\r\nTimbomotumbo\r\nPlayer Behavior and Game\r\nBest Support Leona NA \r\n\r\n- Riot Support Specialist\r\n\r\nI appreciate the replies, but this is simply unfair.I don't mean any disrespect, but many people have had their RP and IP transferred to another account after being banned. I can source many threads being created on the LoL Boards/Forums Archive if need be. I also have seen others have their bans reduced from a permaban to a 2 week ban, however, i'm truly reformed, and I can accept being denied a second chance, I just can't accept the fact nothing can be transferred.\r\n\r\nI've supported Riot for years on years with donation of my well earned cash. I understand I broke the terms of service, and therefore warranted a ban, however, I do believe the saying that everyone does deserve a second chance. And it's just not fair if others are able to obtain what I'm requesting, but I am not able to. You can't give something to one person, but then not the other. It just can't work like that and I know, you guys as a professional company, know this as well. Did I deserve my permaban? Of course I did! I abused an exploit in ranked twice, admittedly. But I've truly reformed and really would like some help into getting me back into this game.\r\n\r\nMy life has gone down hill ever since I was banned. I play league because it's the only environment I feel comfortable in. Take this for instance. I use to be toxic until I was banned for being toxic. I am now a loving, team playing, helpful player. Have not been touched by tribunal in a while, now.\r\n\r\nPlease don't leave one of Riot's biggest fans in the dirt, suffering. I had spent $400+ on the account and I do truly miss it. But I guess there is nothing I could do to get it unbanned, but a simple transfer is all I am asking. I am begging you, as a human being to another, to get me through this in the best possible manner. It's happened before with others, why cannot I not receive the same treatment? I believe everyone is equal. Please, step aside from your job, and have a heart. I am begging you. I really miss my account. Please.\r\n\r\n- Me.","replies":[]}
