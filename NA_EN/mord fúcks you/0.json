Before the change I could grind out games,save up my Ip and grab exactly who I want. Now I have to wait for those stupid capsules and when I get em sometimes Ill get just liek an Ashe and 50 blue essence. And thats like 140 essence only for like 15-20 games... Its ridiculous! I have a certain champ pool and I want to get those champs but I cant.. Its to the point where I dont even want to play cause I dont have who I want to play. You guys need to make it so we earn BE every game cause how it is now.. Its ruined. Im not the only one who feels like this either...","replies":[{"poster":"PEEWEE78368","date":"2018-01-12T12:40:16.633+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes this shit is bad. it pushed me away from the damn game.. I KNOW FOR A FACT I EARNED CHAMPS FASTER I NTHE OLDER SYSTEM SEEING AS  I AM GETTING 810 EACH DAMN CAPSULE...","replies":[{"poster":"Mord Fúcks You","date":"2018-01-18T12:33:59.812+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Exactly! Im lvl 55 and from lvl 30 Ive gotten 3 champs using BE. THREEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! IN 25 FING LVLS!!! And because Riots tribunal system is broken and is incapable of looking at the context of a report, Ive had multiple accounts banned so now I have to start a new one and I cant get champs... I have a lot of resentment for this company and its employees.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Peritheus","date":"2018-01-12T09:37:59.368+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is it really that bad? I mean I know I'm a bit salty about BE since every1 was like you should turn it all into dust just to have a rng filled system that barely gives you anything unless you're a start from scratch guy and a shop that comes ONCE every YEAR ~~omfg r u kidding me!?? ? what is this a special gamemode that people demand and instead get 50 ascensions ~~and I missed it because I was so salty about trying to get gold and runes/masteries scrapped I felt like the game is about to turn into even more garbagier since they won't fix/admit their mistakes that we point out and get shunned on a whim.\n\nAnyway it was talked about and ignored, the grindy solo queue players that play many games you know, get rewarded absolutely nothing compared to the casual 12 yr old playing lvl  bronze fun fwotd fiesta 1-2 games.","replies":[{"poster":"MinchSko","date":"2018-01-12T12:32:02.294+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ya it is really that bad... every level i have always champions under 1350 its just retarded. they give no bleu essence","replies":[]}]}]}
