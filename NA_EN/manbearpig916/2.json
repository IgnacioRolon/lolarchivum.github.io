One report even had a teammate lying to the other team that I am toxic and verbally abusing him. \r\n\r\nI don&#039;t verbally abuse anymore. I do get false reported for verbal harassment if I played poorly as the jungle, though. \r\n\r\nI had 1 game last night where a tahm ketch outdueled my aatrox. I said tahm is overpowered to be able to solo aatrox with just tank items. He called me a little *. I said I  called your champ op. I didn&#039;t call you names. \r\n\r\nLater, he and his teammate said that&#039;s how little * lose.  They then reported me for toxicity. \r\n\r\nYes, this game, plus the other false reports of the week, all add up to justify an impending ban that I probably cannot avoid. You get verbally abused and targeted by bullies for saying anything. You also get reported for verbal abuse by these bullies when you don&#039;t even abuse anybody. You even get reported for a bad game, under the lie of verbal abuse. \r\n\r\nRiot, you need to be fair in the future review of my account. I have reformed and am reforming, and I am still receiving reports that will get me banned. I am behaving, and I will still get banned.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Tantram","date":"2015-12-07T20:43:19.899+0000","up_votes":25,"down_votes":2,"body":"You cannot be punished for false reports.
