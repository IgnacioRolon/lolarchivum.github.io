I didn&#039;t know how the system worked so the next season i ended up placing in Bronze V. I tried to stay positive and climb, which I did. However, when I got to bronze 3, before I could get over 50 lp, i would go on a loss streak thanks to 1) a bad game followed by maybe one more 2) teammates who seemed like they JUST placed 3) flamers 4) AFK. This was so bad I ended up going 12 losses in a row. Luckily, I rose back up to bronze 4. I thought that I should try again in Bronze 3 once I hit there. Now keep in mind B5 and 4 are way too easy to climb up imo. However, bronze 3 again knocked me back. I had 2 afks and a feeding bot lane. I&#039;m a talon main so I kinda suck at carrying and i do understand that sometimes my games aren&#039;t all that impressive, but for the most part I win lane and do my best to be an encouraging and intelligent teammate. Nevertheless, I fall back down to b4. This happened 3 times. I&#039;m honestly kind of done with ranked. Should I just stop playing ranked for this season and try my luck the next? I have a feeling normals would probably be more relaxing.","replies":[{"poster":"MysterQ","date":"2017-08-26T22:48:27.549+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you are stuck in bronze, play to improve. If you are good enough you will climb out eventually.\n\nBut also, if you are truly hardstuck in bronze, treat ranked as normals. There is no reason to add extra pressure to yourself. Just go into games to have fun, to learn, to play a game where both sides may be trying a little more but you should be relaxed.","replies":[{"poster":"blackid103","date":"2017-08-28T02:04:56.943+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"nah b ranked is competitive, if you can't handle the fire in the kitchen get out, that mentality needs to be put into several ranked players","replies":[{"poster":"MysterQ","date":"2017-08-28T03:24:23.795+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"bronze is and should be competitive. But if a guy is not able to climb, he has a choice to make: stress himself out, don't stress.\nThe dude is not climbing, why should he stress himself out. Even if he climbs, it is unlikely he gets to gold, which is the big reward for most people, so again why should he stress. He should play ranked games because in general they have better spirit and maybe he climbs by chance but hopefully without stress.","replies":[{"poster":"hi Ã¬m groot","date":"2017-08-28T03:29:43.136+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Spent a short period of time S5 in bronze when I'd just been playing for a couple months.

For many people the competitive aspect of ranked is what makes League fun. Others just want to mess around in normal games and try new champions or unique builds. Do what you find enjoyable, since it is a game after all.\n\nIf you want to climb out of bronze, then game knowledge is the most important factor- You need to learn what every champion ability can do, what item build paths to pursue, the basics of manipulating waves, the basics of trading in lane, how to \"read\" the map, and where to ward. \n\nWhen I first started playing I ravenously watched youtube videos on these concepts and learned what champions did by playing alot. You will get past bronze 3 if you accept that there's a lot that you don't know about the game, and you commit yourself to learning more.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DISHONORABLE XD","date":"2017-08-27T18:10:11.532+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"no keep ruining others silvers ranked , who cares","replies":[]},{"poster":"SwiftSwifties ","date":"2017-08-27T06:45:22.581+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just find a fun game.League is a game of tilts trolls and no way to vent.

Apparently most people lack the critical thinking skills to figure out what happens to a lot of people AFTER they get perm banned (they don't just quit the game and move on. They figure out how to become even bigger trolls, but now they know what caused them to get banned and they 'play' the system)...but hey, as long as Riot keeps pandering manipulated 'statistics' to the masses, a majority will just eat it up bc they've been conditioned NOT to think by the media these days...just look at the state of the USA, and the world in general.","replies":[]}]}
