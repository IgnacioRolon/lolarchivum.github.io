I bought Infernal Nasus with the left over RP, and got Lolipoppy from the Draven Spinning Axes, once i got enough essence to get  Pulsefire Ezreal I got Arctic Warfare Caitlyn from another Dravens Spinning Axes. Now, I only did this, because I really like Draven and really wanted that summoner icon. BUT, Its now April 15, and I still have not got the summoner icon.
