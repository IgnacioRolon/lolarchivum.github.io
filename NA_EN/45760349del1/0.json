Not only is this going to make them statistically less likely to win and get you reported, it's pointless noise. _**Nobody in the history of this game has ever suddenly started playing better from being told they're trash and toxic.**_\n\n>To say that you CAN NOT say anything back to someone who is being toxic and the only right course is to mute..\n\nThe first part isn't right. I'm a firm believer in killing them with kindness and then muting if that doesn't work. But, if you repay toxic for toxic, all you've managed to do is put another toxic player in the game, for which you will be rightfully {{summoner:11}} ed for. You're responsible for your tox just like the other guy is.\n\n>why even have a chat system to begin with!?\n\nTo help your team win.

If someone is being abusive, mute them (/mute <theirname> in the chat).

The fact that all I said was \"stop intenting pls\" when the vayne \"ran it down mid\" 4 times in 5 mins after dieing once is justified.
