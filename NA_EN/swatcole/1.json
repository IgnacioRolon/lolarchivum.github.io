I'm not sure how to describe it other than that; if you've ever been in a game like this you know what I'm talking about. Anyways, as the game went on the enemy Ezreal joked he was going AFK because he died, and I replied \"no pls :( you might be a %%%%%%, but you're my %%%%%% &lt;3\". Immediately after the game, I was two week banned, despite never being punished, or even warned in my 4+ years of playing League. \n\nDid I deserve the ban? Yes. I've come to realize that behavior like this isn't acceptable in League, regardless of the context or intent. \n\nFast forward to 3 weeks ago. I was in a game with a friend who started the game out by typing in all chat something along the lines of \"%%%%%%s yall suck bitch ass players\". I reported him after the game, yet he was not banned.\n\nYesterday, after winning a game, a friend of my regular duo told the enemy Heimer \"%%%%%%. go die. you suck\" in the post-game lobby chat. I reported him, and I think the enemy Heimer did too judging how long he stayed in the lobby. Yet, he was not banned either.\n\nIn both of these occurrences, I can confirm they were not banned due to me being in Discord/League Voice with them, as well as having them on my friends list. Why was my use of the word \"%%%%%%\" deemed as \"hate speech\" and therefore ban worthy, while these other two people's use of the slur is seen as acceptable enough to not even issue a chat restriction? One could argue that these two other players had a clean history, so Riot gave them a one-time \"get out of jail free card\". However, I also had a completely clean history my entire prior 4+ years of playing League, yet was still instantly given a 2-week ban, so that argument doesn't hold up.\n\nAm I missing something here? In my opinion, their use of the slur was worse than mine, as they were using it for the sole intention of flaming, while mine was used in a distrustful joke about Ezreal's sexuality.** I'm not saying that my use of the word was acceptable - hateful slurs have no place in League, regardless of intent, and I deserved to be banned**. Riot's rules and polices align with that statement. So, why are people like this not banned, or even punished at all? It's not that they somehow slipped through Riot's auto-detection - both of these players were reported by at least one person, and probably twice each. Why are rules like this not enforced equally?\n\n**\nTL;DR: Some people can use hateful slurs and not even get chat restricted, while others are instant 2-week banned. Why does Riot not enforce the rules equally to all players?**\n\nEDIT: Instead of downvoting me, leave a comment telling why you disagree with the points I brought up, then downvote me. I'm looking for a discussion that will lead to an answer.

I never said that I shouldn't have been banned. According to Riot's current rules, specifically the zero-tolerance policy, I should have been banned, but so should these other two players. \n\nPerhaps I am getting hung up on other people's behavior, but it's really discouraging for me to have built up my honor over 4+ months for saying a word I didn't even mean in a toxic way, yet people who use the \"zero-tolerance word\" in an intentionally aggressive and hurtful way are given zero punishment.  \n\nAccording to Riot, using the word has \"zero tolerance\", and you will be banned, no matter how clean of a history you have. Yet, these people aren't.

This isnt about wether this was right or wrong by riots standarts. We know where they stand. Its about wether this was justified from a \"i still have a brain and can take things into consideration\"- standpoint, which riot is clearly incapable of. Understandably so. But this doesnt give you moral highground. \nIts like grounding your kids when they were just fighting for fun to see who can score more goals and mikey jokingly called his brother bad for loosing. Nobody is offended but in comes Helicopter mom grounding them both for fighting. Yeah those are her fucking kids and she can do whatever she wants but that doesnt make it less re**** (aparently thats a nono too).
