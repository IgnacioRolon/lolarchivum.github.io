Here's why.","subforum":"Player Behavior","up_votes":3,"down_votes":27,"body":"**I know this seems like a backwards, counter productive thing to do (especially in today&#039;s culture), but I hope and urge you to read the whole thing before making a judgment/dismissing it. *This isn&#039;t me asking to be unbanned* - this happened two months ago and I already did my ban time. Instead, I&#039;m hoping to shed light on a policy of Riot&#039;s that has good intent, but also unaccounted for consequences, and ultimately should be slightly changed or reworked.**\n \n&nbsp;\n\nI&#039;ll start this off with a story for context. Awhile back, I was playing normals, and it quickly became one of those fiesta games where everyone from both teams are teasing each other in /all chat after a hilarious 5v5 teamfight broke out at level 1. Later on in the game, after the enemy Ezreal barely died in a 1v1 mid lane, the following exchanges were said:\n\n &nbsp;\n\n\n> Teammate: \"bad gg\"\n> Ezreal: \"o. :( leaving then bye\"\n> Me: \"no don't leave :( You might be a %%%got, but you're my %%%got <3\"\n\n\n&nbsp; \n\nI was promptly banned for two weeks.\n\n &nbsp;\n\nAt first I thought the system auto-caught me, so I contacted support. They told me that although they agree I didn&#039;t mean it maliciously, Riot has a &quot;zero tolerance policy on homophobic slurs&quot;. Never before had I been warned, chat restricted, or banned in my 4+ years of playing League. By all definitions, I am not a toxic player. For simply using the word &#039;%%%got&#039;, in what I intended to be a wholesome joke, I was placed into the same pool of players who full on flame others, intentionally run it down mid, AFK after first blood, or troll others - and continue to do so after being warned/banned by Riot. The entire game had this sort of &quot;teasing each other tone&quot;, which continued on well after I said this. It&#039;s a common joke that Ezreal is gay, which is what I was referencing. I wasn&#039;t calling the player a %%%got, I was referencing the champion. It&#039;d be no different than saying &quot;You might be a lonely sad mummy, but you&#039;re my lonely sad mummy &lt;3&quot;. The &quot;:(&quot; and &quot;&lt;3&quot; further suggests that it wasn&#039;t in a flaming matter.\n\n &nbsp;\n\nAnother, even more extreme example:\n\n &nbsp;\n\n\nAfter I was banned, I told my IRL friends about it. A few days later, one of my friends decided to test out the zero tolerance policy in action by reporting a teammate of his who had used the word %%%got. Shortly after, he got the &quot;a player you reported has been banned&quot; message, and, by checking the account activity, we confirmed it was a two week ban. What was the* horrendous flaming* that his teammate had said to deserve a full two-week ban? Surely, he must have typed up quite the storm, giving his full piece of mind about *just what he thought about their &quot;Diamond&quot; 0/3 Jhin*. He must have really *blew up* on him to deserve a full two week ban, right? Well, you&#039;re partially correct. After giving up first blood to an invade, his teammate *absolutely exploded* into the chat by typing:\n\n &nbsp;\n\n> \"fuck, i'm such a %%%got sorry\"\n\n &nbsp;\n\nThe point is, *context matters.* **Don&#039;t get me wrong, people who intentionally use homophobic slurs to insult and flame others should be fully punished.** However, Riot should revise their policy so that using the word, regardless of intent or context, doesn&#039;t always result in an instant two week ban, especially if the player has never been disciplined before. Or, allow cases to be reviewed on a case-by-case basis, rather than a &quot;sorry, zero tolerance&quot; approach to all bans regarding usage of slurs. Or, just take context into account when banning and/or deciding the severity of punishment. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nI think it&#039;s clear that these two examples were not deserving of full two week bans - the same severity for people who actively try to ruin games for others through flaming or trolling. Perhaps some sort of punishment was needed, but not this harshly. Riot&#039;s goal for punishments is for reform, not straight out banning because it doesn&#039;t solve the root problem. I, and I&#039;m sure the other guy, didn&#039;t even know Riot *had* a zero tolerance policy on this, and if they did, that it extended to jokes and self deprecating apologies. A simple warning message would have been just as effective on impacting on my future use of the word as the two week ban did. The difference is, the two week ban lead to unfair frustration, feeling as if I was being overly-punished for something I didn&#039;t even know was against the rules. God even knows how my IRL friend&#039;s teammate felt, getting banned for the horrendous thing he said.\n\n &nbsp;\n\nIt&#039;s extremely frustrating that doing something like this triggers an instant two-week ban, while you can blatantly and intentionally flame your teammates (on stream, no less), with videos showcasing it delivered right to Riot&#039;s doorstep via the front page, and still remain unbanned. \nHashinshin examples (I&#039;m sure there&#039;s more, but that&#039;s what I found with 30 seconds of searching): \n[[1]](https://clips.twitch.tv/AthleticResoluteBillDoritosChip) \n[[2]](https://youtu.be/y9RM6IvDKJw?t=10m10s) \n[[3]](https://youtu.be/y9RM6IvDKJw?t=8m37s) \n[[4]](https://youtu.be/VlmHdPfrJ8E?t=2m22s) \n[[5]](https://youtu.be/y9RM6IvDKJw?t=6m18s) \n[[6]](https://youtu.be/VlmHdPfrJ8E?t=3m39s) \n[[7]](https://youtu.be/VlmHdPfrJ8E?t=4m11s) \n\n\nTyler1 also took forever to get banned, with the same front-page attention, and his flaming/AFKing/intentionally feeding being arguably worse.\n\n &nbsp;\n\n\nI think we can all agree these have way more toxicity behind them and deserve a two-week ban exponentially more than someone offhandedly using the word &#039;%%%got&#039; ever will. \n\n &nbsp;\n\nIf Riot doesn&#039;t want to rework their policy, I&#039;d love some transparency on how they feel about cases like these. Nonetheless, I&#039;d love to hear your thoughts below, and if nothing comes from this, at least you now know to never say &#039;%%%got&#039; in game, *no matter what. Period.* \n\n\n\n &nbsp;\n\n\n**TL;DR:** Riot instant two-week bans anyone who says the word &#039;%%%got&#039; in game, regardless of context or intent. These bans are not eligible to be reviewed on a case-by-case basis due to Riot&#039;s zero tolerance policy on homophobic slurs. Riot has good intentions behind this zero tolerance policy, but it ends up with the side effect of punishing undeserving players. I suggest they update the zero tolerance policy to only harshly punish players who use homophobic slurs intending to cause harm, instead of just anyone who says one offhandedly.","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2018-03-12T23:23:28.017+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":2,"body":"\"Wholesome jokes\" do not use language with a decades-long history of hatred and homophobia behind it.

Full stop.\n\nAs I said, perhaps in my instance a punishment was needed. Two weeks though? I'm not arguing that Riot should do away with banning people who say a slur - that would be stupid. But the severity. If you've been banned before, then sure, maybe 14 days. But the fact that I have not been toxic in 4+ years of playing, then offhandedly say that and get 2 week banned, when there's people calling their teammates \"pieces of shit, useless, etc\" and AFK all in the same game not get any sort of punishment is absurd. Usually you get a warning, chat restriction, 1 day, 3 day, 7 day, 14 day. I skipped all of those steps and went straight to 14 day. Getting a warning before jumping 2 weeks would have been nice, especially given my history of never once being toxic.","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2018-03-13T00:37:56.888+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SWATCOLE,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=E5VEhPeY,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2018-03-13T00:30:39.384+0000)...then offhandedly say that and get 2 week banned, when there's people calling their teammates \"pieces of shit, useless, etc\" and AFK all in the same game not get any sort of punishment is absurd. \n\nWhile I agree those players are violating rules and should face punishments, those terms are insults against a single individual.\n\nWhen you use this particular form of hate speech, it is not only an attack on the individual being targeted but also an insult against an entire section of the population, as you're equating part of their identity with something negative enough that it can be used as an insult.

When I tell my friends to \"oh fuck off\", I don't mean it as a real insult. The same with this. If I was using it as an insult, then yes - you'd also be insulting the whole gay community. But I wasn't. Nonetheless, you can't tell that over text and I understand why I was banned, even if I disagree with it. \n\nThat's not where I see a flaw in Riot's policy. I see it in the fact that you are in no way able to try to get it repealed. The other guy was insulting himself. You shouldn't get banned 14 day banned for insulting yourself. Bronze players are seen as bad, and that's negative enough to be used as an insult. So, according to your definition it's \"hate speech\". Calling yourself Bronze after a bad play doesn't get you banned, and neither should this. If you attack someone else and call _them_ bronze, then yeah, sure, some sort of punishment is in order. But not yourself.\n\nRegardless, I still don't see why people who do worse things are given more chances and more warnings. And that someone with a 4+ clean record is given none.","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2018-03-13T01:21:05.790+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SWATCOLE,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=E5VEhPeY,comment-id=0001000000000000,timestamp=2018-03-13T01:03:02.203+0000)If I was using it as an insult, then yes - you&#x27;d also be insulting the whole gay community.\n\nThe thing about slurs and hate speech is that those words DON'T have other uses.

Despite being tied to positive traits, it would nevertheless be banned by Riot (which they have every right to).\n\nMy point was simply that punishment should be because of insulting someone rather than using a particular word.  I actually think the divisiveness of \"ni**er\" is a great example of why we shouldn't do that with \"fa**ot.\"  Making a word unspeakable just ties it to greater division.\n\nFor example black people say \"ni**er\" all the time, but if a white person dared to say the word, it would get them kicked out of school.  This divides the groups to a degree because there is literally a difference in the language they can use.  I don't want this to be what happens with \"fa**ot.\"\n\nI fail to see how I make the word \"fa**ot\" divisive.  I never actually use the word myself, I'm gay (so if anyone should be offended by its use, it should be me), and I'm comfortable with people using the word so long as they aren't being truly homophobic (like saying \"those fa**ots should all just drop dead\").\n\nIt shouldn't be a word for polite conversation of course, but the same is true for curse words and insults in general.","replies":[{"poster":"TrulyBland","date":"2018-03-14T00:55:26.510+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Right off the bat: Sorry, I didn't check the name and thought I was still replying to the OP.

There the negative association is there simply because an insult is inherently and intentionally negatively connotated.\n\nThe problem regarding the divisiveness is a tricky one. I will be honest, I don't really think I'm in a good position to argue on this, but in my opinion normalizing insults like these reinforces the divide just as much as banning them. \n\nSince you are **not** the OP, I'll rephrase what I said earlier in a more neutral way:\nI agree that the way words are used matter.

Back when TV first started, it was seen as completely taboo to show people who were married couples in movies/TV shows to even sleep in the _same bed,_ covers/clothes on and everything. It was seen as \"too sexual and offensive\". Over the years, however, it was shown more and more. Now, today, no one bats an eye to see full on sex scenes in movies. \nWhy? \nWhen you repeatedly \"censor\" (not literally, but I hope you get what I mean) the word, you actually give it **more power.** I'm not saying you should therefore, to solve the problem, go around and call gay people %%%gots 24/7. That's homophobic. But by saying \"you can't use the word, no matter the context\", you're only contributing to the fact that it's seen as extremely offensive. \n\n\n\nLet me give another example. When we were all younger, cussing was a super \"no go zone\" for us. However, as we grow up and are exposed to cuss words more, even using them ourselves, they loose a lot of the initial \"punch\" that they had. Why? Repeated exposure lowered it. \n\n\n\nIn psychology, it's common knowledge that the best way to get rid of one's fear is through constant exposure to said fear. The reasoning is the same as I stated in the last two examples. \n\n\n\nYou find it offensive because you have attributed it to such a \"high standard of offensiveness\". **Once again, if I am directly insulting you for being gay by calling you a %%%got to intentionally cause harm through the word, then you have _every_ right to be offended. ** But simply using the word in a context that isn't an insult, and instead just tossing around the word should not be offensive, and the more you say it is, the more meaning you are giving it, and therefore, the more effect it will have.\n\n\n\nAll of that is unrelated to the simple point I made in the original post, which is why I didn't touch on it. The argument I made in my original post is that the context of if the word is as an intentional insult intending to cause harm should be why someone gets banned, not just that they said it in a sentence, but I guess this goes along with it. This is a fact that not a lot of people understand, thus we have the zero tolerance policy.

The person your friend reported said \"I'm such a \\___\" as if being of that group of people is a bad thing. Honestly that's precisely the sort of thing that would genuinely hurt and offend another player in the same game who happens to be of that group of people.\n\nImagine how you would feel if every time somebody failed, they said \"Wow I'm such a <insert _your_ name here>!\" It's the sort of thing that would lead people to associate <insert _your_ name here> with being a failure.

Language like rank is unique to league of legends, and it doesn't have a history of real-world discrimination. As such it doesn't serve as a reminder in-game to peoples' real-world experiences related to such derogatory terms for homosexuals or people of particular races.\n\nAdditionally, bronze is a ranking directly correlated to making more mistakes (such as dying) in-game, so it's actually a fairly accurate and acceptable thing to say if you do make a mistake in-game.\n\n> I understand that using the word is offensive to people, and I&#x27;m not claiming it isn&#x27;t.

But I can't throw my hat in the ring when you're using examples like the \"extreme example\" that we discussed earlier. It's very different when you use the term endearingly as opposed to using it in place of a negative word. Your case I'm absolutely in favor of reducing the punishment, the case of that person in the extreme example... I'm not sure how I feel about that. It's not as bad as other uses of the word, but it's still very unacceptable.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Herald Est Mors","date":"2018-03-13T21:13:59.190+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I don't even have to look through the comments to know you're gonna have sensitive pansies telling you how bad the word is and how you deserve to be PERMA BANNED THAT TWO WEEKS ISNT ENOUGH, but honestly that's crap.

Not flaming, yes. Maybe in your case even not meant homophopic or first line negative. But the usage as such is in 99% at least negative in terms of devalue just because you  _use_  it.

And any filter working 99% proper is a better filter then one with less accuracy in the other direction wich may lead to let´s  say 90% accuracy= 10% really not necessary racistic words ingame.
