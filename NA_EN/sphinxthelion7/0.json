The game is now showing up as a remake. Please give me back my LP! I didn't lose the game cause it never actually happened. I don't want to lose my hard earned LP to server errors.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-15T17:07:12.790+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't see that there were any server issues during this game with Lux, and we don't have a reason to drop a player like this.  It sounds like your network failed to establish a connection, so communication with the game never happened.  Let me know if you're still having this issue, so we can troubleshoot it before more penalties incur!","replies":[]}]}
