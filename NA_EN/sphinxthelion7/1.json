I think it would help a ton with \"toxic\" banter... if good players get their ELO on the losing team they won't really care how bad their team was.\n\nThe cause of \"toxicity\" is when good players are forced into a loss by bad players, it has always been the case.","replies":[{"poster":"GripaAviara","date":"2019-01-28T15:29:58.279+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's why they try to address with the new ranked.
