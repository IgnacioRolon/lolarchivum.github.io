In looking at my match history, the last game played by me was..definitely not me. A very skilled Yasou apparently used my account. \r\n\r\nI've sent in a support ticket, and I'm anxious. I've had my account since the release week of the game (Bought my buddy and I copies at target - still in the box/cd format).\r\n\r\nWhat is the average wait time for a problem like this?\r\n\r\nThank you for your time!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-27T22:22:28.084+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't worry, we got your back.  The account was already locked to prevent any further unauthorized access.  I do see you have two tickets open on this, so one of them will likely be closed out to prevent confusion.  The ticket was escalated to our account recovery team, who will reach out to you asap and help restore access.  Hang tight until we reply back!","replies":[{"poster":"Lucroarna","date":"2016-12-28T21:11:23.530+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello,\n\nDon't mean to be rude, and don't reply if you're too busy - I'm aware of the high volumes. \n\nBut, I figure I will ask, any word on an ETA here? I would like to be able to play some Nautilus with my buddies during the holiday weekend.\n\nThank you, and Happy Holidays!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lucroarna","date":"2016-12-27T22:24:52.965+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is so great to hear!\n\nI work in IT, and deal with lots of CSRs with various vendors we deal with.\n\nNever have I had such a fast response in the business world, so to see this in my personal world is amazing.
