In game, i couldn't see stuff in the left side like the practice tool settings. If i change the resolution or if i set the game to bordeless window or windowed it works, but i would like to play with my normal settings. If i take a screenshot it doesnt show this black rectangle.  Sorry for bad english i hope you can understand my problem.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-07-11T18:12:22.577+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you using a 4K monitor or exceeding 1920x1080?
