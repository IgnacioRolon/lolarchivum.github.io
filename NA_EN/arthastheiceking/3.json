I live in Italy and where I live right now the internet connection is very very bad (3 mb/s max). Because of that I can't play league anymore because my ping is always high (150-200+ ms if im lucky). So today I gave up. I was wondering if I could get help in any way, I dont know how, one of them could be a refund but I dont think riot would care. Anyway, thank you for any help and sorry for my bad english","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-09T21:43:47.363+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There could be a few reasons for higher ping, and it's usually a network issue having trouble maintaining a strong connection to the game server.  You can strengthen your connection and fix up wonky settings through the troubleshooting steps in the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide.  Keep in mind that physical distance to the server can be a reason for higher ping as well, so any troubleshooting can't necessarily exceed that.  The guide should provide an improvement from what you have now!","replies":[{"poster":"Arthastheiceking","date":"2016-09-10T21:12:22.405+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i tried everything but it just doesnt work, i definitely gave up after my last game.
