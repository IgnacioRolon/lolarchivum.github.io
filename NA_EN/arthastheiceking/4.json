Then the client said attemping to reconnect, so i closed since my internet wasnt working. After 30 seconds it cambe back up, i restarted the client, logged in and it automatically reconnected to the game. The loading screen page was black and it said that i couldnt connect to the match, but my internet was ok. So i restarted the client but that happened again. All of this happened 10 minutes ago. Now when i try to restart the client the same thing happens over and over but after 10 seconds I can only see the client that says \"game is still in progress\". Sorry for my bad english i hope you can understand. I have ruined a match for 9 other people because of this bug and my poor internet connection.\n\nEdit: cool now i have leaverbuster\n {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}} ","replies":[{"poster":"The Magyk","date":"2017-03-04T23:29:18.409+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"same thing happened to me minus the internet connection loss and the game launching in the first place. got through champion select and the game client never opened.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-04T23:51:35.912+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"Is sounds like you're having a connection problem reaching the game servers.
