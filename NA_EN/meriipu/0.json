We recognized her wave clearing would be substantially weaker, but forcing her to interact more with her auto-attacks seemed reasonable, given that she had access to more spells (via mana) and moved a bit faster.  We'll be monitoring her closely and react if she needs further tuning.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kaioko","date":"2016-06-29T19:46:18.753+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because they want Lulu to fit in more as a support than as a mid/top laner. Honestly she's pretty boring to play against if she goes in a solo lane. She can wave clear easily and then she's got enough shields to stop whatever damage you hit her with.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Haihefa","date":"2016-06-29T19:44:26.567+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"What are you talking about? They have wanted to slow her wave clear down for a long time. This is the change they should have made back in like 6.8? I think it was. Not the other nerfs they did to her. Zed has below a 50% win rate and honestly isn't even all that ban worthy, not to mention the number of counters to him.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Meriipu","date":"2016-06-30T11:08:48.265+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well please stop the nerfs at this at least","replies":[]}]}
