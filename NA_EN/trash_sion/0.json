There's a content creator by the name of HuzzyGames who utilizes pentakill on his stream for segments he intends to create separate videos with.\n\nAs far a monetizing it, I think only if it's indirect, meaning you couldn't create CDs and sell them, but you could say create a youtube video and suck up the ad revenue, or donations, even patreon stuff should be fine as well, so much as you're not selling the music itself as your product.\n\nThat's just my understanding of it though, I'm no lawyer or anything.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Butt√®red Biscuit","date":"2016-01-21T02:34:14.915+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh sweet biscuits, I was wondering about that.
