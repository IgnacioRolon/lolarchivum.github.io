I was wondering if you can answer why languages have been specifically restricted from certain regions? Let's say if someone from Korea came to the US and didn't understand english entirely so he/she would be more comfortable playing league with the language set to Korean but It is restricted so he can't. Would there really be any problems with the ability to change the language completely even if you don't reside in the region?","replies":[{"poster":"xKurama","date":"2018-01-27T04:11:22.154+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi, I tried emailing about this and I was told that I should add to a forum to discuss about this. I completely agree, I think that players should be able to use any language they wish without having to change regions. All languages should be available in NA in my opinion. I'm currently studying Japanese and I would love to have it in game and have Riot support an official way to change languages. As of now the only way I found to change in game audio is through LVOC (a 3rd party application) but it doesn't fully work since Riot is changing the type of audio files for some of the Champions. I personally don't want to be tampering with the files just to hear the language I'd like to hear. I'd rather have Riot provide a feature to change in game audio. I know that a good chunk of the League community likes Japanese culture (mainly anime) and would love to hear some Japanese voice actors in game. Some of the voices will sound familiar if you watch a good amount of anime.\n\nBesides my whole view of adding Japanese just because I'm studying the language, I completely agree that there should be more languages to select. Spanish and French are very common in NA and your point about a Korean person coming to NA is also true. I can understand that you don't want to be getting teamed up with someone that doesn't understand your language, but I don't think that it should affect which audio the person wishes to listen to in game. I think it would be a great way for Riot to help provide methods of studying foreign languages. I've caught on to phrases and words that I already understood in Japanese and I've even learned new ones.\n\nI think that if the issue is having to do with the main language of the country, then only the written parts of the game should be region limited. For example, an American who only knows English doesn't really have any business on the Korean server since they wouldn't be able to communicate with any of the other players, but if the Koreans wish to HEAR the English audio, that should be available to them. All of the audio in different languages in my opinion should be available to all regions.\n\nRiot if you could provide this feature, I think many fans would be happy and you'd be helping many people practice foreign languages.\nThanks","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-18T03:12:07.139+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not actually entirely sure why the language choices are so limited for certain regions, but I do know it has something to do with the predominant languages spoken in that regions countries.","replies":[{"poster":"këÿ","date":"2017-09-23T09:22:10.216+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for replying.","replies":[]}]}]}
