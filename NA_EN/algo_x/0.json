This year I got to gold only to discover that I would be ineligible for the rewards.\n\nI think the biggest frustration isn&rsquo;t with the rules and boundaries that players have violated; it&rsquo;s with the messaging and transparency. It would have been a lot easier to avoid potential violations if I had been aware of all the penalties and how to accumulate them.\n\nIt felt like I was unaware of consequences until I had accumulated the penalties and from there, the potential for recovery was non-existent.\n\n***Context for my specific reason for being banned, as the comments below seem to assume it was for bigotry***\n\nI was one checkpoint away when the season ended. I'm Honor 1.3 currently. I think I may still be doomed though because I was banned in August for acquiring too many chat restrictions. I never displayed bigotry in-game chat, mostly excessive typing and flaming feeders, some afk'ing at spawn when the team wouldn't ff at 3/25 score lines.  (have since reformed, limited typing)\n\nJungle in Silver can be so tilting.... sad!
