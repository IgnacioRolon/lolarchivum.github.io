This is happening more and more frequently. \r\n\r\nWhen I am in game and I try to ping anything, like an enemy's summoner spell after it was used, it turns into a blank line or a time stamp with my name. I am also missing messages from my teammates as well (confirmed with a duo to compare our chats). Anything I ping like an item, a spell, or a portrait is affected. \r\n\r\nThanks in advance.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-11-02T15:54:32.212+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There might be some game files not loading your assets properly.
