Mine says that it's open. What does that mean and what kinds of other \"Statuses\" are there?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-22T23:49:25.285+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Open means that you can freely communicate with your Specialist.  Solved doesn't mean a lot, just that a response was sent back from a specialist.  Closed would be that the ticket is permanently closed, so you would have to create another ticket.  Let me know if that clears things up!","replies":[{"poster":"Ottoman Esquire","date":"2018-03-03T08:18:57.391+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"my ticket says hold what does it mean?","replies":[{"poster":"Caenen","date":"2018-03-03T10:01:41.746+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same for me, please answer me aswell seperately (just copypaste should be enough tho) so I get the notification. \n\nI'm mildly confused because the ticket said **Open** for some time yesterday, and I didn't ask anything new becuase the ticket is already long as is, thinking the response is in work. Now it's on **Hold** again.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Miffee","date":"2017-10-01T23:04:13.845+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for my reply!
