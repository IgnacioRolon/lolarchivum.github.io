The new player chest is guaranteed to provide you with Ashe and Garen, though.  Also I just want to point out that the skin shard you found is a pretty rare skin, and it you got a ward skin too.  Very lucky! ^^","replies":[{"poster":"pobożny Mokry","date":"2017-10-21T16:47:23.537+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hey Rito Games with one developed game!  check this thread pls https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/tEEwOz3e-is-the-free-hextech-chest-for-450-1350-ip-champions-actually-random :) \n\nfrom Rioter in this thread \n> Ahaaaaa! I honestly thought you were talking about the normal hextech chests, my bad! The Premium Chest will give you a random skin for a champion you own that costs 975 or less. Since Soraka has 3 skins in the shop that qualify right now it's pretty unlucky that you've gotten the same one, but it is still a random skin. I'm assuming that you're making multiple accounts and leveling them up, because otherwise, I'm a little confused as to how you're opening so many premium chests xD.\n\n\ni can also show you screenshot from rito support confirming that first hextech chest for lvl5 acc should give you skin for champion you own, random skin if u dont have any champions or ur bought champions have only 1350rp+ skins, sadly its not in english. \n\nand i loved urf corki, sadly it was 5 years ago xD","replies":[]}]}]}
