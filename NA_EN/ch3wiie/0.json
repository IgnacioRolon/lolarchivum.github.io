This seems to be the problem that I'm having, but they don't have a solution for it yet. \r\n\r\n_\"This doesn't seem to be the case for everybody, but it seems that once some people get all 4 chests, they can not get any more key fragments from matches. I got all 4 chests on day 1 and haven't had another fragment since. I've just been stuck at 2. Win after win, nothing.\r\n\r\nI've checked this with a couple people and we all seem to have gotten all 4 chests when it started happening.\"_\r\n\r\nThey claim to have implemented a way to guarantee a key fragment drop after a certain amount of possible drops, but I don't really believe it.\r\n\r\nSee statement below: \r\n\r\n_\"This is how the current tuning of the drop rate works:\r\n- It is possible to earn enough key fragments to open every chest you find in 4 week period.\r\n- You have to win to earn a key fragment. Performance does not factor into the drop rate outside of this.\r\n- You can earn key fragments in any mode that yields champion mastery points.\r\n- The drops are somewhat based on luck, but it’s weighted such that after a certain number of wins if you didn’t get a fragment we’ll just force a drop to   avoid being screwed by RNG.\r\n\r\n-Riot Socrates- Lead Game Designer\"_\r\n\r\nPerhaps with the new PROJECT:whatever materials that they were trying to introduce, it conked out the key fragment maths. :/\r\nRegardless, looking forward to a solution to open my chests without RP.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-04T15:37:47.203+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dark Annie and Rineyy provided some solid information that I hope helps!  Looking into this for you it looks like you've received a steady amount of fragments, which is slowing down now.  A reset is roughly 30 days, and once they drop you will notice a strong drop rate that will gradually slow down.  As suggested, our [hextech crafting ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207884233-Hextech-Crafting-Guide)guide will have everything you need to get crafting.

The more keyfragments you get, the less chance you have of gaining more in the following matches. It resets based on when you obtained them. I have been getting quite a lot of key fragments over the past day myself after a period of not getting them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kürama","date":"2016-08-04T13:59:31.028+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The drop rate for key fragments is a curve, not a line. With each fragment you earn, the chance to earn your next one goes down slightly. This number resets roughly every thirty days after you earn your first key fragment.\n\n\nRiot wanted to give players who didn't play as frequently a good drop rate for keys, without making it feel like farming was mandatory if you wanted keys.\n\n\n\nNote: There's currently a bug which prevents you from earning key fragments if you're playing a champion you don't own. This is unintended, and a solution for this is being worked on.\n\n\n**[Learn to craft.
