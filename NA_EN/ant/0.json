At various points, I&#039;ve mained the likes of Lulu, Lux, Anivia, Malzahar, Teemo and Sona. I&#039;m naturally drawn towards cute, colorful, high-energy, free-spirited characters. Initially, I was totally obsessed with Lulu. She had come out 2 weeks prior to when I started playing so I got to spend the whole week playing her via the free rotation. I thought she was the most amazing character, design-wise, that I&#039;d ever seen in a game. I mained her for a long time. I spent a lot of my early days as a new player on League slowly learning how to use her skills (the fact that she had different effects for enemy/ally really tripped me up a lot). I bought all of her skins, made an alt account with the name &quot;Lulu&quot; in it, bought the Lulu emotes (Delightify and Cup-Yay).\n\nFast-foward to [the animation of a shimmering bubble that shoots into the fountain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2G1Gy7xBsjE) and puts people to sleep at the start of a game.\n\n&quot;What in the world is this?&quot; I asked. I was very curious by the in-game teaser, but then I read [Riot&#039;s remarks on the matter.](https://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/2017/10/champion-roadmap-october-2017/)\n\n&quot;*We also wanted to take this chance to do something a bit more playful and bubbly as opposed to the dark and serious champions we&rsquo;ve done recently. The new mage will have unique abilities that haven&rsquo;t been seen before in League, so hold onto your summoner spells and don&rsquo;t fall asleep, because change is coming&hellip; cataclysmic change. Also, sparkles!*&quot;\n\nSuddenly, I went from curious to buzzing with anticipation. &quot;Is this going to be another Lulu-type character?&quot;\n\n[Then her Champion teaser dropped.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZnVHNJfFMY) My first reactions of it when I messaged my friends went like this:\n\n&quot;LOL she&#039;s cute\n\nAnd potentially very obnoxious\n\nMy new main?\n\nWe have a Disney character on the rift now\n\nVery annoying\n\nWell that settles it. My new main&quot;\n\nLittle did I know that would actually come to be the case.\n\nI must have watched that teaser a dozen times. Here&#039;s this obnoxiously happy character in League of Legends. She&#039;s jumping across the rift, using three Flashes in a row, being a massive nuisance for her enemies. When she showed up on the PBE I couldn&#039;t wait to get a few games in as her. Just like when I first started playing Lulu, Zoe was confusing as hell to control. But, little by little, I got the hang of it and she&#039;s now the most fun aspect of the game I&#039;ve had playing this game in a long time.\n\nEverything about her kit is so much fun. Landing mile-long sleep bubbles is the most satisfying thing ever. However, I tend to focus on the character design aspects. As far as Zoe&#039;s character goes, she&#039;s perfect. She&#039;s bubbly and obnoxiously innocent. She reminds me way too much of myself when I was a little kid. She sings randomly, talks way too much, makes up her own lyrics to songs, makes up words, gets mad when she messes up (miss Q&#039;s). The little things about her in-game model are great. Her hair is bigger than she is, she turns to the summoner and sticks out her tongue, she slips and falls randomly when she stops walking. Every time I look at this character, it genuinely makes me happy. She is amazing and I love everything about her.\n\nI embraced the consensus of her being &#039;annoying&#039; and &#039;cancerous&#039; and thought it was great how people got mad over her. It made me like the character even more. However, I was really disheartened by the genuine *hate* for the character &mdash; both for her personality and because of her kit. I knew she was going to be aggravating, but the community had this almost universal hate for her and it was not a good time to admit you liked Zoe. I&#039;m happy they nerfed her into the ground and then re-adjusted her numbers and abilities to be a lot less ridiculous. Now I can actually play her without her getting banned 90% of the time, or picked by the enemy team the other 10%. \n\n**tl;dr:** Zoe is the most perfect Champion I&#039;ve ever played. She&#039;s annoyingly bubbly, high-energy and free-spirited. I see a lot of myself in this character. She hits all the right notes for me and I identify with the character more than any other Champion in the game. \n\nThank you CertainlyT and everyone else involved so much for this awesome character. You got a lot of flack for designing her, but she&#039;s drawn me into the game more than any other Champion ever has. {{champion:142}}","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2018-03-24T15:46:29.541+0000","up_votes":33,"down_votes":12,"body":"http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Zoe/Development\n\n> #Designers\n> \n> Gameplay\n> \n> * Bradford “CertainlyT” Wenban\n> \n> Narrative\n> \n> * Odin “WAAAARGHbobo” Shafer\n> \n> Artwork\n> \n> * Jessica Oyhenart\n> * Elena 'Hellstern' Bespalova\n> \n> Visual\n> \n> * Sunny 'Kindlejack' Koda\n> * Tyson Murphy\n> * Anna 'Newmilky' Nikonova\n> * Larry 'TheBravoRay' Ray\n> \n> #Credits\n> \n> Voice Actor\n> \n> * Erica Lindbeck\n> \n> Attached Concept Art\n> \n> * Tyson Murphy\n\nCertainlyT is only responsible for the gameplay section of Zoe, which is easily the worst part of Zoe's package and in fact is one of the worst kit (from design and balance stand-point) ever made in League.\n\nThe credit of Zoe's thematic design and artworks go to the other ladies and gentlemen outlined in that infobox.","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2018-03-24T16:37:01.736+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":9,"body":"Well as for me, her gameplay is great too (after they adjusted her numbers and made cleanse stuff properly work on her E).\n\nShe has great high and low moments with her W in teamfights and those mile-long Es.

Old Nid issue on a full box of steroid? Check. Literal RNGesus and shockingly binary play pattern encouraged by W? Check. E being so unbelievably overloaded it was like the power budget of 3 ultimates being crammed into 1 NORMAL spell and required a gut so extreme it cut out like 60-70% of the spell out of the initial version? Check. Some people see that as \"\"innovative\"\", but I see that as posing a selfie with a loaded handgun to the head, there is reason why people don't do that but then this guy does it, even right after seeing someone already died from accidental discharge right in front of his face (Nid rework); it's not \"\"innovative\"\", it's just stupid and wrong. There is a difference between innovation and thinking outside of the box, and jumping off a cliff.\n\nZoe currently is only short of being officially confirmed a rework, right after just being released. Her design is utterly broken in all kinds of technicalities, it's kind of amazing someone can fuck up so badly as it's almost like they actually tried REALLY HARD to fuck up this bad.","replies":[]},{"poster":"hhaavviikk","date":"2018-03-24T19:29:14.984+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Votable Jester,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=UJRZARik,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2018-03-24T16:37:01.736+0000)\n>\n> Well as for me, her gameplay is great too (after they adjusted her numbers and made cleanse stuff properly work on her E).\n> \n> She has great high and low moments with her W in teamfights and those mile-long Es.

The bimodal distribution in experiences that i suspect exists and was alluding to is between people who permaban yas vs. those who don't. \n\nIf this underlying distribution is significantly bimodal in this way then the \"background\" games which contain a player who permabans yasuo can be subtracted and the \"signal\" games which represents the experiences of those who do not constantly ban him can be properly assessed. In this situation yasuo has potentially two problems, one being why so many players are of the proclivity to permaban him causing the bimodal distribution in the first place, and any other potential problems (which may or may not even exist) would be uncovered from the signal games which would not be assess-able without this kind of subtraction. \n\nIf the underlying distribution is not significantly bimodal then that means that yasuo's high banrate comes from many people who comparatively infrequently ban yasuo, and the spread of experiences around yasuo's pickrate is closer to normal and likely lower in deviation, implying a smaller set of potential problems that people are more unified on. \n\nIn this example a large spread implies different necessary action compared to a bimodal underlying distribution. \n\n--------------------------\n\non another note the number possible combinations of champions who make it into in a game is \n\nfor blind pick:\n140 choose 5 * 140 choose 5 = 1.7386025e+17\n\nand for draft: \n140 choose 5 * 135 choose 5 = 1.4456206e+17\n\nDivide these results by 2 if the exact same team comps on opposite sides of the map doesn't make a difference to you. \n\nYour calculation is 140 choose 10 but you're neglecting that which team the champion is on makes a difference. If zed and yas are on the same team that is a different set of teams than if they are on opposite teams leading to more combinations than you suggest.\n\n------------------------\n\nI noticed you are a concept artist so hopefully all the stats talk doesn't bore you.

The example of banning Yasuo was more to illustrate that each individual player has their own experiences and they do not really equip one to speak to the 'average' player experience even if they log a lot of hours.\n\nFortunately I get to spend my days designing champions and skins instead of losing my mind trying to create prediciton models or track trends for LoL but I am very close with our teams statisticians whose work I greatly respect as it empowers us to make the best decisions we can at any given time.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"AnataBakka","date":"2018-03-28T20:32:41.585+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"wtf, how did you get that number? \"573,658,984,353,378\" \n\ni got 1,738,602,515\\*10^17 combinations for a normal blind pick match considering both ally composition and enemy composition","replies":[{"poster":"Kindlejack","date":"2018-03-29T04:38:37.110+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just used the standard combination calculation\n\nN! / n!(N-n)!\n\nbecause you can't pick the same champion twice, although as Sixdogman points out below the realistic calculation would take into account the makeup of each team separately and also realistically consider the potential pick in each role.","replies":[{"poster":"Chromatic Eagle","date":"2018-03-29T19:00:25.208+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Kindlejack,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=UJRZARik,comment-id=000c00040000000000010001000000000000,timestamp=2018-03-29T04:38:37.110+0000)\n>\n> I just used the standard combination calculation\n> \n> N! / n!(N-n)!\n> \n> because you can&#x27;t pick the same champion twice, although as Sixdogman points** out below the realistic calculation would take into account the makeup of each team separately and also realistically consider the potential pick in each role.\n**\n\n\nClearly you haven't seen my bronze games.","replies":[{"poster":"Kindlejack","date":"2018-03-29T19:27:24.444+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"xD","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2018-03-26T17:29:09.156+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Kindlejack,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=UJRZARik,comment-id=000c0004000000000001,timestamp=2018-03-26T17:19:49.260+0000)A shadow ninja is badass no matter where you live &gt;:)\n\nAs someone who lives in the shadows with a clan of ninja -- nah, it's a pretty normal Thursday. :P","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Spoopy uwu","date":"2018-03-26T18:57:09.537+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm another Zoe lover, although I kinda stopped player her after my teams I was playing with and against would tell me how stupid I was and all that jazz {{sticker:sg-janna}} \nBut now I'm hoping I can pick her up again without feeling like I'm in a 9vs 1 anymore!

According to champion.gg, she's slightly above average in Plat+ and below average in Bronze/Silver.
