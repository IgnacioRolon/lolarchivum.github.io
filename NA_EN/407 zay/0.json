Most of them are scams to get your username/password, but a few have work temporarily, giving the user RP without Riot getting paid for it. Riot tracks them down and undoes the RP transaction. If they bought content with this RP, then the content is taken away.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Zielmann","date":"2016-07-30T03:34:41.005+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Submit a support ticket asking about it.
