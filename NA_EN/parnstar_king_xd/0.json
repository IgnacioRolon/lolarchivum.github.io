Anyways the point is I have been leaver busted by the \"remake\" system, it took me about 4 minutes to try and reconnect after restarting my computer.  I don't know what to do about the leavers, but at least help me with my client, here are the steps I have taken\r\n\r\n* Repairing client\r\n* Re downloading and installing client\r\n* manually transferring a friends client who claims to never crash (which it happened to him today as well)\r\n* playing in custom games to test client load screen and it didn't crash (but it did in an actual game)\r\n\r\nAny help is appreciated, I do not know what to do as far as fixing client.  can we at least talk about my leavers? \r\nP.S. I am on a updated x64 bit computer\r\nThank you!","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-15T18:40:36.154+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Connections errors after champ select are usually a sign that your client cannot establish a great connection to the game server.
