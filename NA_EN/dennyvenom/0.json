My ping usually reads at a steady 49-51, but everything else is weird. I would walk kinda slowly, and then speed up very quickly and walk at a regular speed and then the opposite. This also seems to affect me more than anything because other players in the game seem to be moving perfectly. Sometimes it does affect them though. My friends also say to them I look fine, but to me it's so difficult to play with this. This bug often fixes itself on the next patch, but it's such a pain to wait for so long. Is there any fixes on what I should do? I've tried reinstalling the game and repairing the client but nothing seems to work until next patch. Anyone else have this issue?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-18T05:16:35.451+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is not a bug, but rather common symptoms of *Packet Loss* issues.
