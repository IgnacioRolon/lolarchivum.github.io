In LCS this year rageblade tristana was one of the things that got CLG their victory. Up until it's appearance in LCS, Rageblade tristana was an \"off-meta\" pick. \n\nSomething being off-meta does NOT mean that it is bad or strategically weaker than other things. It just means that people aren't using it. \n\nAnd \"it's normals\" IS a valid reason to do off-meta picks. It being ranked is perfectly fine as well as long as you have experience with the idea or believe that it is the best move for the situation you are in. \n\nWhile I do agree that when laning with someone else esp, you should be respective. But, that works both ways as well. If I want to play adc renekton or adc thresh or something, whoever is laning with me should be respective of that decision. The people I play with are not able to, nor should be able to, stop me from playing something off-meta.","replies":[{"poster":"z14GaKI7TO","date":"2016-04-22T10:03:23.314+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"Yeah, because I'd LOVE Viktor support, 0 cc except for his easily avoidable W? Nice, VERY good support. \nIf you're picking something off meta, at LEAST fill the requirements of the role. Don't try and play something with 0 cc as a support, you're pretty much just killing your lane at that point. You might as well dive level 1.\n\nAlso, I will not accept RB Trist as_ that_ off meta. Even on paper it seems like it would be good. ","replies":[{"poster":"whocares123","date":"2016-04-22T10:54:42.843+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright, if RB trist isn't off meta enough for you, then consider the fact that in the last LCS season I saw kennen appear as both an adc and a support. Both of those were very off meta picks. Hell my last game I went vs a rageblade runnans adc kennen. And lost. In ranked.\n\nHere's the thing though, when it comes down to it, you don't get to decide what I play, if I want to play adc janna or something I can do it. I shouldn't be restricted from that.\n\nOf all off meta picks to highlight you actually pick one that would work half decently lol. Viktor's cc is pretty nice, considering it's a slow even if the stun doesn't connect, and he has massive poke. There is a catagory for poke-style supports, like karma and such. Viktor's cc isn't as reliable as most meta poke supports but his poke tends to be higher. \n\nRegardless of whether an off-meta pick is good or not, I still have the capability to do whatever I want as long as I am not intentionally trying to lose the game. \n\nThus is the purpose of normals - for casual play/practice against other human players. In fact, one of the best ways to get better is to give yourself a disadvantage, such as an underpowered off-meta pick, and get good at that, as it will force you to make better decisions and overcome your disadvantage.","replies":[{"poster":"Beldair","date":"2016-04-22T11:47:21.666+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well said.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"LordGeovanni","date":"2016-04-23T02:37:57.643+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if easily aviodable cc makes you not a support there are lots of supports like that damage can substitute for cc thats why support morg and lux is popular not because they give their adcs kills not that they NEED kills its better if they have them but if a support pokes the enemy down and gets a double kill the adc will most likely rage because they didnt get the kill even though they have their farm but if the support didnt poke there would have been no kills in your lanes favor at all and even a chance that the enemy would have pushed you the adc away from your farm","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"SrbLud","date":"2016-04-22T10:16:06.593+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'll play sona jungle in normals if i want to...\nNo one can stop me.\nIf i want to experiment in normals pvp i'm allowed to.\nIf someone doesn't like it...well too bad...","replies":[{"poster":"z14GaKI7TO","date":"2016-04-22T10:46:40.384+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"fine play sona jungle i could give a fuck less, just don't do dumb shit bot where it literally directly affects someone","replies":[{"poster":"Lauchmelder","date":"2016-04-22T11:02:17.466+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"What do you think {{champion:48}} or {{champion:78}} Support were called when they first surfaced?","replies":[{"poster":"z14GaKI7TO","date":"2016-04-23T01:15:33.717+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dont' recall at any point them being off meta, because they actually make sense.

Not to mention that it seems like the meta is usually just a list of who's broken/strong as hell and who counters those broken/strong as hell picks. \n\nWhich, if that's what you'd call metagame, then one could also argue that any pick that DOESN'T fall into those categories such as comfort picks that may have fallen out of favor as the patches roll onward, are just as off-meta as say...'support' Yasuo. Technically an out of favor character in their proper lane COULD still be considered a non-meta pick even though that's their proper role that they were designed for.\n\nI agree that team comps are worthwhile even in normals (it's always nice to win), but what are we defining as meta here? Furthermore, what about the fun factor? It's nice to win, but sometimes you just get bored playing the same handful of champions. Sometimes you really do just want a different experience once in awhile.\n\nLet's also ask the question of non-meta picks in other roles. If bot-lane is regulation, does it matter if you have an odd top, mid, or jungler? Those are going to affect others too, from sub-par ganks to fed enemy laners coming to shut down bot lane. Where does one draw the line, and when do you allow a game to be a game and let people have some fun?\n\nI think you can live with one off-meta pick, as long as it's not SUPER awkward, provided you know that things are gonna be tough if the stars don't align and the lane/role doesn't work out like the player hoped.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Maximum Morde","date":"2016-04-22T11:43:33.664+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol, I play fill eve support man and I win more games than I lose with it.
