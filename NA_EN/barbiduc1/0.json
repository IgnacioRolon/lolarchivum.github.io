I'm having this problem when I try to launch League. My client just doesn't start and I get this error tab: http://imgh.us/eroare.png\r\nPlease, help me. It happened to me few hours ago and by just trying to launch the client and closing it I somehow managed to make it start. But that doesn't seem to work now for some reason. I really need some advices, hopefully from a Riot official.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-11T22:21:22.094+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It seems like your client might have crashed in the background.  Restarting your computer might fix this up.  If not, let me know when exactly you're getting this message so we can try and pinpoint the cause.  Are you also using the updated or legacy client?
