Make sure that you have a priest on hand during this confrontation. Also ensure that your friend is firmly tied to an iron chair in the middle of a salt circle. At this point you must present him with evidence of his \"deals with the devil\" and attempt to persuade him to fight against the evil within him. If this fails, the priest must be prepared with holy water, a crucifix, and an original Latin copy of the Bible from which to read in order to dispel this entity.","replies":[{"poster":"Sinlaire","date":"2015-06-05T16:56:54.431+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"The power of Christ compels you!\"\n\n\"Really Jay?

Once the affliction has taken hold of the child you can only wait it out until it burns away.
