I&#039;m looking forward to the pre-season.\n\nI wanted to share some theorycrafting I did for my main - {{champion:119}} \n\n**PRIMARY - Precision**\n_KEYSTONE 1 - Fleet Footwork :_ This is pretty much a better rendition of Warlord&#039;s Bloodlust. It&#039;s always been essential to Draven so he can kite and catch axes effectively. \n\n**_KEYSTONE 2 - Triumph :_** I really enjoy this keystone, as it plays off of Draven&#039;s passive with the bonus gold. During teamfights, and even short 2v2s in the bot-lane, it really does help, because you may just need that extra bit of health to lifesteal so you don&#039;t die to something like Death&#039;s Dance.\nI would possibly switch this out for **Presence of Mind** in lanes that I know will be farm-lanes that I&#039;ll need to outpressure the enemy with.\n\n**_KEYSTONE 3 - Bloodline :_** I love lifesteal on Draven, and I believe that **Bloodline** will just furthermore enhance his sustainability. In match-ups where you might need to damage the enemy faster, say, out-do a Twitch on attack speed, you could also choose **Alacrity**. Really, any three of these are viable to take.\n\n**_KEYSTONE 4 - Last Stand :_** This one was a hard one. I chose **Last Stand,** because I know that there are so many times where you&#039;ll get ganged up on by the jungler and the ADC, and in these situations Last Stand can come in clutch to chunk enemies and kill them before you die. This is helpful versus assassins such as Zed and Fizz. When versing a tanky team comp, it would also be very helpful to switch to **Cut Down**, which provides extra damage to tanks (pretty much a mini {{item:3034}}). However, you could also go for** Coup De Grace**, as it helps when trying to quickly eliminate squishies.\n\n**SECONDARY - Domination**\n\nFor the secondary tree, really ANY tree is viable. It&#039;s so amazing how much versatility they added to the Rune system - I&#039;m so looking forward to experimenting and trying different combinations.\n\nDomination gives +12% attack speed, which enhances Draven&#039;s early game extremely well.\n\n**_KEYSTONE 1_** - Cheap Shot : This keystone works extremely well with Draven&#039;s E, &quot;Stand Aside&quot;. It makes for a great combo, as you can E, slow them, tag them with a true damage Q, and go in for the kill.\n\n**_KEYSTONE 2_** - Ravenous Hunter : I can&#039;t begin to say how much I love this keystone - since Draven already does an insane amount of damage during laning phase and when fed, this ability is going to be so strong on him. You heal for a percentage of damage dealt with your abilities - I like this because, since Q is an ability, it encourages you to catch axes to get that extra effect, rather than just auto-attacking and not really bothering to catch axes.\n\n\n\nI&#039;m extremely happy with the Runes, and will continue to theorycraft. I&#039;m so glad you can change them in the pre-game lobby, as it allows more strategic elements to be implemented. I&#039;m really looking forward to Pre-Season 8!","replies":[{"poster":"Nakoruru","date":"2017-09-25T19:19:31.717+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://eune.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/preseason-update/8200-8214?build=20202363 = 15% CDR of 45%\n\n{{item:3100}} {{item:2301}} {{item:3089}} {{item:3116}} {{item:3115}} {{item:3165}} = 90% CDR (with changes to Spellthief line at PBE)\n\nSo, it leaves me with 60% excess CDR which is converted to 120 extra AP due to TRANSCENDENCE rune.\n\nThis build works best on Karma because her ultimate is available from the start, so you can easily stack THE ULTIMATE HAT rune.

Also her passive helps to reduce cooldown of ultimate and can utilize items I used: {{item:3100}} {{item:3115}} by autoattacking champions (also hitting with spells reduces cooldown greately).","replies":[{"poster":"9tt2","date":"2017-11-12T23:32:04.361+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What order and when do you sell the magical boots?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rykagnar","date":"2017-09-25T19:23:33.941+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Nakoruru,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=XY1nj6w4,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-09-25T19:19:31.717+0000)\n>\n> http://eune.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/preseason-update/8200-8214?build=20202363 = 15% CDR of 45%\n> \n> {{item:3100}} {{item:2301}} {{item:3089}} {{item:3116}} {{item:3115}} {{item:3165}} = 90% CDR (with changes to Spellthief line at PBE)\n> \n> So, it leaves me with 60% excess CDR which is converted to 120 extra AP due to TRANSCENDENCE rune.\n> \n> This build works best on Karma because her ultimate is available from the start, so you can easily stack THE ULTIMATE HAT rune.
