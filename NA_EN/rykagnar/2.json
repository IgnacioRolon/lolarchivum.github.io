I&#039;ve bought lots of skins over my years, don&#039;t get me wrong, but this is getting sort of ridiculous. \r\n\r\nIt always felt good to buy a few skins and then buy one with the leftover RP you had. Can&#039;t do that anymore. I have a feeling the new price of skins in Season 8 is going to be 1820.\r\n\r\ntop kek","replies":[]}
