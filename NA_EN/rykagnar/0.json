Please don't take this away from me. It's really fun to make poke pages which normally don't scale well (such as Ziggs if you look at his late graph) do better. Since they're not burst assassins just going in for one rotation and then leaving, they absolutely need CDR but then if they get their normal CDR build they either don't have enough mana or they lack sufficient damage and die too fast as well. My solution is to lose the first 25 minutes and rely more on the jungler but allows me to remain relevant late (which is hard in this tankier shield/heal meta). I think the meta is fun personally... I like seeing more tanks but I see Adaptive Help vs me as Ziggs and it's already very hard so that's why I want these more scaling builds. Ziggs already won't solo kill people early if they're good and his waveclear isn't that amazing either (unless you use exorbitant mana) so I think I need to make him scale harder. I can't just take turrets and snowball every game. This 30% CDR build with Tear is my favorite by far and the only way to make Tear viable imo. If I don't go so many CDR runes, the Tear delays my own CDR way too much to be justified.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Akali is SO HOT","date":"2017-09-02T22:40:11.606+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:22}} {{item:3075}}","replies":[{"poster":"Bârd","date":"2017-09-03T06:26:11.477+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, they should really teach you how to build more than just Ashe.\n\n{{champion:432}} {{item:3094}} {{item:3285}} \n\n{{champion:516}} {{item:1083}} \n\n{{champion:99}} support with no {{item:2049}}","replies":[{"poster":"Fake Masks","date":"2017-09-04T12:32:57.353+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:34}} {{item:3085}}  I would like to see a tutorial where they make you build this, for no reason at all.","replies":[]},{"poster":" Cryptocurrency","date":"2017-09-03T07:57:00.844+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol, please support tutorial where lux builds rabadons first item xD","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"LostFr0st","date":"2017-09-02T20:21:27.537+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Firstly, there are 2 tutorials.
