I can&#039;t remember the specific post, although I believe it was something from Kitae.  However, a lot of the newer text seems to say &quot;Piltovan&quot;.  Admittedly I think both could be understood to be correct, sort of like &quot;aluminum&quot; and &quot;aluminium&quot;.  After all, we use &quot;Noxian&quot; for things pertaining to Noxus, when we could just as easily call them &quot;Noxan&quot;.  Perhaps Demacian dialects use &quot;Piltovian&quot; and Noxian dialects use &quot;Piltovan&quot;.\r\n\r\nEither way, it would be nice to get a little clarification on this, if there is indeed a &quot;correct term&quot; being used.","replies":[{"poster":"Interlocutioner","date":"2017-02-01T17:16:08.500+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"The official word on the official word is that it is...
