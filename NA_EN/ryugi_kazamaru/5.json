This thread will be for selecting judges that will preside over the auditions in the case that the community votes alone can not select a clear and valid winner of the competition. Judges will also run the auditions and set forth the means by which the people auditioning will present their portrayal of Illaoi.\n\nIn this thread, people will make suggestions for, and or offer their services as, judges. Once we have a list of Judge Candidates, another thread will be made with a Poll so that votes can be cast to select judges, which will require each voter to state who they voted for. No less than 3, and no more than 5 judges will be selected. Each person is allowed 2 votes. One primary, and one secondary. **NO MULTIPLE VOTES WILL BE ALLOWED**. That counts for smurfs too, folks...seriously.\n\nRegardless, please toss up your selections, or offer your services, here.\n\n**NOTE:** Remember that being a judge is based on your ability to judge who can most accurately portray the personality of the champion(s) in question based upon their canon Riot Lore. It isn&#039;t necessarily about writing ability of the applicants, but the personality they will portray to the community. Keep this in mind before you decide to nominate yourself or others.\n\n&gt;**Addendum:** It has come to my attention that people are learning who owns the Champion Smurfs before they have a chance to post their auditions. I would ask ANYONE who wants to audition for Illaoi to **_PLEASE KEEP YOUR INTEREST A SECRET, AND TO NOT TELL ANYONE WHO YOU ARE, EVEN HINTS_**. This is to eliminate favoritism and bias in the voting process, and will make everything much more fair. Thank you in advance! In addition, refrain from RPing on the client (if that still goes on) as Illaoi until AFTER the auditions are over.\n\n**Judge Candidates**\nRyugi Kazamaru\nAskKarthus\nNapaIm\nAsk The Kindred\nSariran\nthetimevigilante\nCryypter\n--\n--\n--\n---","replies":[]}
