So, I&#039;ll just toss up a less flowery thing and ask some questions straight up.  I know you might not be able to answer a lot at face value, but, maybe you can give non-committal answers to help flesh things out.\n\n>As that is the case, the area that has been gouged out to the Southeast of the map strikes me as peculiar. It seems to match the last known description of a cursed land, one with connections to...darker, more twisted things. I shudder to write its original name, but it has been known to be spoken of colloquially as &quot;The Void&quot; or as a passage to it.\n\nTL:DR - Can you confirm the scratched-out area is supposed to be Icathia?  Pretty sure it is.\n\n>To the West of the Golden City of Shurima, ... The rubbing is most unclear, however, there appears to be a shape not unlike that of a crocodile, or an alligator, near what may be some crude reliefs of fish, and waterways. ... I have heard tales of vast jungles that supposedly lie to the South. But this map seems to suggest such things may truly lie to the West of Shurima, perhaps along with some mountains? \n\nTL:DR - That totally looks like a croc.  Would it be safe to assume that the Plague Jungles/Kumungu might be over there?  And, if not, what exactly might that be hinting at?\n\n>To the Southeast, near what is certainly the Sai, ... It almost appears to be a clocktower of some kind, perhaps an obelisk? My thoughts remind me of ... Urtistan, and it is said there is still a grand clocktower standing there. Could this be an indication of such a place actually existing?\n\nTL:DR - That looks like Zilean&#039;s clocktower.  Would it be safe to assume that might be where Urtistan is?\n\n>I daresay Shurima appears to be surrounded on all sides by mountains. But, where one would expect to find the always tall Mount Targon, last listed as North of Shurima on our maps, the only truly large mountain appears to be South, beyond the Sai! This is most troubling to me, as it would seem as if perhaps the most massive natural landmark in all Valoran has moved considerably from my only reference maps. ... But if such is the case, they what lies to the North? They appear similar to the peaks of the Freljord, but two enormously diverse ecosystems being next to one another is most illogical...\n\nTL:DR - The mountain to the south is the largest feature on the map, which would seem to suggest that it&#039;s Mount Targon, but that&#039;s pretty different, which leave it a very confusing development.  Can you comment or elaborate on that somehow?\n\n>The large structure to the Northeast is quite puzzling. It almost seems to be a single massive crag or plateau rising from the desert floor. It is said there is a creature that guards a great mystery in Shurima, an insectoid of some kind. And yet, I cannot shake the notion that the rocky, angular, jagged peaks almost bear a striking resemblance to a mysterious rocky denizen&#039;s head, said to strike with Unstoppable Force.\n\nTL:DR - Theories on what that is consist of it being Malphite&#039;s new home in new lore (The Monolith maybe?), because it looks like his head, or maybe it&#039;s the thing Skarner is guarding?\n\nI pulled the Shurima Tablet Map into Photoshop and blew it up and messed with contrast and other things to try and clarify some of the details, and that&#039;s what I managed to come up with.  Understanding the things I&#039;ve mentioned would really help me, and others, get a handle on some of the locations of these territories, and help me construct a better map in my head, and on my own time.","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2015-10-06T02:28:28.871+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ryugi Kazamaru,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=iJ62W5JM,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-10-05T23:27:21.372+0000)\n>\n> It seems my [in-universe letter](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/story-art/bmExZ8PN-cartographer-seeking-shuriman-merchant-of-the-glowing-life) was removed or deleted because the mod in question must not have gotten that it was addressed to you, and linked to the Shuriman Tablet Map, trying to talk to the character you were playing in that discussion thread.  \n\nAw.  Sorry.  I saw the thread and was waiting until I got home to reply.  It was a fun piece of writing too :/\n\n> TL:DR - Can you confirm the scratched-out area is supposed to be Icathia?  Pretty sure it is.\n\nYes!  Icathia was striken from the record when it turned from a relatively normal place to the beginnings of what it has come to be.  An example of damnatio memoriae.\n\n> TL:DR - That totally looks like a croc.  Would it be safe to assume that the Plague Jungles/Kumungu might be over there?  And, if not, what exactly might that be hinting at?\n\nWell spotted on the croc!  It is, however, not safe to assume that there are jungles over there.  There _was_ water there, when the map was created.\n\n> TL:DR - That looks like Zilean&#039;s clocktower.  Would it be safe to assume that might be where Urtistan is?\n\nIt's not Zilean's clocktower, unfortunately.  Shurima did have, at one time, a network of 'lighthouse'-like constructions that were used for navigation through the vast distances of Shurima.  They may also have been used for signaling.  Doubtful any have survived.\n> \n> TL:DR - The mountain to the south is the largest feature on the map, which would seem to suggest that it&#039;s Mount Targon, but that&#039;s pretty different, which leave it a very confusing development.  Can you comment or elaborate on that somehow?\n\n...yeah.  So.  Let's pretend that the Shuriman creator of the map was mistaken when they put the giant, map-dominating, mountain to the South.  Wouldn't put too much faith in that particular representation.\n\n> TL:DR - Theories on what that is consist of it being Malphite&#039;s new home in new lore (The Monolith maybe?), because it looks like his head, or maybe it&#039;s the thing Skarner is guarding?\n\nI would suggest that the outcropping has a more... crystalline form than rocky.  I know it's really hard to make out in this version of the map, though.\n\n> I pulled the Shurima Tablet Map into Photoshop and blew it up and messed with contrast and other things to try and clarify some of the details, and that&#039;s what I managed to come up with.

I'll understand if you can't answer. :P\n\nNonetheless, very insightful and interesting stuff.

I was about to have a conniption fit over trying to work that one into the map.  The signal towers are also a really, really cool thing.  The dry lakes is also a nice touch.  I suppose that leaves the mysterious structures to the West and Northwest...and maybe the Southeast.\n\nThe Northwest thing almost looks like little ruined pillars, and the circular symbol ALMOST looks like a skull, or maybe a mummy.  This lead me to believe that, maybe, it was a tomb-marker, sort of like the Valley of the Kings in Egypt.  It might also give Amumu a place to call his origin.  Though, that's jumping to conclusions.\n\nThe Western Symbol almost looks like it could be a camel, which might suggest an area of trade or passage out of Shurima, but that, again, is trying to extrapolate the very rough shape into something recognizable.  There appears to be a settlement surrounded by rocky structures over there too, so, maybe more badlands, but it's hard to say.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BaWsMaNn","date":"2015-10-06T05:57:38.202+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Yes! Icathia was striken from the record when it turned from a relatively normal place to the beginnings of what it has come to be. An example of damnatio memoriae.\n \nJust a question about this. Does this mean the original map of Valoran is wrong and that Icathia is now to the west of the continent not to the east as stated in Malzahar's lore? If it's position has moved does it still share borders with the Tempest Flats and the Voodoo Lands? Sorry if this is a bother, I just really enjoy the Void champions and their lore so it is really cool to see Icathia included on the map.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2015-10-06T05:33:36.079+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mount Targon eh?  \n\nIf that's true then I am gonna be all giddy.","replies":[]}]}]}
