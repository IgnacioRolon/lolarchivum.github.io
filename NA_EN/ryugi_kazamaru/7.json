You may not be part of Narrative, but even when the Narrative folks like Jaredan show up to talk, they often can&#039;t tell us much of anything, and leave us with more questions than answers.  For example, the map threads.\r\n\r\nThe fact of the matter is that there&#039;s a huge rift between Narrative and us crazy lore folk.  It&#039;s been built over years and years of a real lack of communication and understanding.  We want it to mend, but there are a lot of people still bitter over it, and a lack of responses from Narrative folks regarding some really burning questions and situations doesn&#039;t help things.\r\n\r\nHOWEVER, that doesn&#039;t mean you shouldn&#039;t feel welcome to participate in these kinds of discussions.  Shurelia was a Game Designer, and wasn&#039;t directly linked to lore, but she still interacted with the community a lot, and heck, she even did some Roleplaying with everyone.  That&#039;s how the whole Roleplaying Boards thing got started and grew.  Interacting with you guys makes the gap seem smaller, and it&#039;s nice to feel like someone cares about our concerns, or even shares them, even if, realistically, there isn&#039;t that much you can do to solve them, at least someone knows.\r\n\r\nI can&#039;t speak for everyone, of course, but I&#039;m always happy to see you posting.  I love the tidbits you can drop.  And, I loved the Bard thing you wrote too.  You obviously have a love for the lore and the universe, easily similar to our own, which is why I think you have every right to hang with us and ask all your questions, and participate.\r\n\r\nP.S. - I saw you tried to add me on the client, but I&#039;m not always on there.  If you wanted to chat about lore stuff or whatever, we could set up a good time, or you could add me on Skype, because I&#039;m always on Skype.  And I&#039;m always down to nerd out about lore.","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2015-10-05T00:39:23.620+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, Ryugi,\n\nI totally understand where people are coming from in terms of the disappointment in finding me in a thread instead of someone from the Narrative discipline.  A lot of threads are asking questions of them specifically, and I should learn to leave well alone.  \n\nI get excited when I see map threads, and _**want**_ to participate, but I can't say anything to the main body of the topic, so I end up channeling my excitement into less useful avenues - like stories about VO lines.\n\nWhat I think I've learned is that if it's a thread asking a specific question of a Rioter who isn't me, then it's not my place to talk.  \n\nI hope you'll count me amongst the crazy lore folks too - I get so excited when I see some new story coming out.  This often manifests itself as fan fic, or a fan fic competition, or cupcakes, cookies, or whatever.  One time I made miniature Ekko Z-Drive jello desserts - and there's nothing particularly sane about that.  (They had edible glitter in them.)  When I made the Shurima tablet, I had also created an ancient Shuriman con-lang, pictograph writing system, wrote a modern Shuriman lullaby that referenced one of the ancient cities (and recorded myself singing it), and wrote several notes from a very full-of-himself archaeologist with proper citations from several academic books, with author name/s, publisher, and date.  When I go a bit nutty on a subject, I go full nutty.  \n\nNone of that is official canon - unless one day they decide to use it.  Who can say?

Let me know.\n\nOnce again I love reading your responses Bioluminescence!\n\nIt's not your fault, and I really hate to say this, but every time you respond to a Lore related before Riot narrative does makes me feel bad about Riot. And to be honest, they don't respond to almost every lore related thread they didn't start themselves.\n\nThe sad thing is: hearing you respond to a lore related thread as a RIoter who can't provide detailed information about the topic makes it feel like Riot's trying to copout of answering a question by sending a Rioter from another team to answer a question they don't wanna answer by giving us a non-answer.\n\nI hope this is not the case and Riot reverts to being as upfront and honest about it's game development as it has been in semi-recent years.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Impetual","date":"2015-10-05T06:59:28.447+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Bioluminescence,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=1KmfIy8I,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-10-05T00:39:23.620+0000)\n>\n> Hey, Ryugi,\n> \n> I totally understand where people are coming from in terms of the disappointment in finding me in a thread instead of someone from the Narrative discipline.
