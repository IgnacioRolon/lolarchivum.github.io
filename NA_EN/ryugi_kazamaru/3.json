Honestly the biggest thing that irks me is the frequent use of the word \"said\" after so many parts of dialogue.  The way that I write in my personal style is to eliminate that word as completely as possible.  Rather, I tie the language to what the character is doing at the moment they're replying or talking with their scene partner.  Or, if I have to say who said something that directly, I try to use a synonym, rather than reusing \"said\" again and again.\n\nMaybe it's just me.","replies":[{"poster":"Smithney","date":"2015-10-30T00:06:51.736+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The way you are introducing?

I'm neither writer, nor English speaker, so the details pass over me as well. ;)\n\nIt's not so much that I get weary of it, because it adds more depth to the characters in my personal experience.  Half or more of what we say is in how we say something, and what we do while we're speaking.  For example, if you say something like...\n \n> Angry curses followed him down.\n> \n> He spun out into a trailing forest of ropes and pulleys, flags and pennants. He thrashed as he fell, tangling his limbs and weapon. Fate was mocking him, wrapping him in a folded shroud of canvas sailcloth.\n> \n> “Not like this, damn it!” he roared. “Not like this!”\n\nThe pause where the author stops to say that he roared splits the story and slows it down.\n\nBut, if you rewrite the same thing just slightly...\n \n>\"Not like this, damn it!  Not like this!\" \n>\n> He spun out into a trailing forest of ropes and pulleys, flags and pennants. He thrashed and roared as he fell, tangling his limbs and weapon. Fate was mocking him, wrapping him in a folded shroud of canvas sailcloth.\n>\n>And his angry curses followed him down.\n\nIt's very clear who is speaking, and the story continues onward fairly fluidly.  There's no pause to mention how he's speaking, instead it is incorporated into the narration itself, and it gives an idea that the story is continuing onward at the same time.\n\nAgain, everyone is a critic, and this is just my personal taste.  But there's nothing actually \"wrong\" with how it was written.  It's style.  I just happen to prefer it my way as opposed to using \"said\" and the like.","replies":[{"poster":"Smithney","date":"2015-10-30T01:01:32.294+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"That was a very thorough comment and a good example.
