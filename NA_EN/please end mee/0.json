I don't have a paragraph or a whole point, I just hope that, when she does get a Visual Update, and hopefully soon, it will look something like this.  \n\nUnfortunately, I don't know who the artist is, but if somebody does, please let me know so I can give them proper credit. \n\nEdit: The artist is Riot Hylia aka Thomas Randby. Great work! \n\n2nd Edit: I noticed a lot of people in the comments talking about how she needs some Gameplay changes, and as somebody who has played Janna for over 2 years, I partially agree. While she doesn't need a full VGU, at her core her gameplay is fine, in my opinion, she could use some changes. The damage she receives from her passive is pretty much worthless, but the added movement speed, and the movement speed she gives to her ally champions is actually quite helpful. I think Riot should just shift the damage aspect of her passive and put the power somewhere else where it's more helpful and useful.  \n\nSecondly, and this my only other issue with her gameplay wise, but her Q is just kind of lackluster, and very.. average. What makes Janna's Q special is that it can knock up people in mid dash, like Rengar, but they can do so much more with it. It should reman a skill shot, and a handy disengage tool, but I feel like it could be more than a simple charge up ability. Also, and this is just a thought, but maybe let it leave a path behind that increases ally movement speed when they walk in it, similar to pre-rework Galio, because that was actually quite helpful, and thematically, fits perfectly for Janna.  \n\n3rd Edit: I noticed a few people aren't happy with her new lore, and while I respect your opinion, I would like to know why? Personally, I love her new lore, and her new lore is the reason I continue to play her. She's a goddess of the winds now, a bringer of hope to the hopeless, an ageless being, a guardian for those without one. \n\nIn the old lore, she was just a Zaunite orphan who found out she had magic then left for Piltover. That essentially gave her the same story as Vi, but instead of magic, Vi had hextech weaponry.\n","replies":[{"poster":"Valor Bot","date":"2018-08-18T03:30:13.992+0000","up_votes":31,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thomas Randby (Riot Hylia) is the artist behind this masterpiece :)\n\nI agree Janna could use a VGU, even if it's a minor one gameplay-wise.

While the art isn't complete, it's clear that her legs were going to be completely exposed, too. We have to understand that Riot is a global company, so they can't just ship Janna out in a g string and tube top, like they used to be able to do when they were a small indie company, remember how people reacted to Kai'sa and her neckline?

Knock-ups in general stop people mid-dash, that's not unique to Janna's Q. However, it is still special, simply due to the fact that I believe it is the *first* charge ability in the game. Therefore, it should still remain a skill-shot charge-up knock-up ability, but personally, I think the actual usability of the skill should be changed. I might just say this because I suck at landing it, but her Q is just way too hard to use in its current form.\n\nI will agree that Janna doesn't need a full VGU though.

Ornn, Volibear, and Anivia don't need mortals praying to them to manifest. The Aspects, while they use mortals hosts, don't vanish because humans stop praying to them (the Aspect of the Moon is proof of this.) Like, if anything, Janna's origins seem to fit closest with demons now, since demons feed on pain and misery; Janna's just the opposite, since her strength comes from hope and prayer.\n\nOn it's own, I think Janna's lore is fine.
