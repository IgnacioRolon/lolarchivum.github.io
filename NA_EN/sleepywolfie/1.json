However these two could be &quot;fixed&quot; with sligh changes in order for them to fufill their &quot;side role&quot;, and besides both are dominating the meta in their main role. These two champions are Kog&acute;Maw and Kalista.\n\nAlso by &quot;side role&quot; I mean: E.g: Quinn: ADC, side role would be the &quot;Roaming ADC&quot; thanks to her ultimate, etc.\n                                              E.g 2: Graves: ADC, Side role would be the &quot;Bruiser ADC&quot; thanks to his &quot;tanky&quot; capabilities and his mid ranged AA and abilities.\n\n Kog&acute;Maw:\n\nSide role objective: The Hypercarry ADC that needs great peel from allies. Kog&acute;Maw is supposed to have a interesting gameplay involving his teamates a lot. In orded to succeed these champion needs to stay far and deal damage whenever is possible (and by that when he is safe), he will be a primary target for enemy Bruisers and assassins and his team will need to protect him from them.\n\nWhy I think this isnt happening: Riot has made recent changes to Kog&acute;Maw since the big preseason patch, and I was astounded by the changes to Kog&acute;Maw. Im talking about mainly the change from Q passive to the W ability. Everyone Maxes the W ability, therefore has more attk speed early-mid game, as a result this champion has a BIG powerspike in the early-mid game. This is not what a hypercarry is, a Hypercarry should be weak or very weak in the early and be able to scale fantastically to the late game. Ive been checking Kog&acute;Maw stats, and the proof is there: Of 43,000 matches analyzed Kog&acute;Maw has a 58% of Win rate in matches with duration of 0-25 minutes and decays to 52% in 40+ minute matches. By the way, the Win rate is big because he was recently overbuffed, however this shows that he is not fufilling his side role of THE hypercarry ADC. Link of this proof: http://champion.gg/champion/KogMaw.\n\nHow to solve it: By the way, im not 100% sure how to solve this appropiately because im not a game designer. Im trying to communicate this and why I think its not right. All i can say that recent Kog&acute;Maw changes are controversial to what Riot said at first hand how would this champion be played as. That minimum dmg from W and the extra attk speed as apassive moved from Q to W are Early game improvements, this champion should have Late game improvements.\n\n  Kalista:\n\nNot gonna lie, this one im not too sure if she should be changed much. Im making this post primarily for Kog&acute;Maw, but I decided to drop Kalista in because i feel something is off in her.\n\nSide role objective (I suppose): The &quot;Duo&quot; ADC. A champion that is successful by playing well with its bot lane companion, good synergy between Kalista and her bot lane companion (being a support, or whatever) is what defines her and will bring them to victory in the bot lane.\n\nWhy I think this isnt happening: I think this has happened for a long time now, almost since release. This champion IMO doesnt feel like good synergy provides her TOO much. I just played a match with Kalista, and I realized that even without much synergy with my bot laner we were able to win easily. So I figured that maybe something should be changed around here. I feel like the pact mechanic isnt as important as it should be.\n\nThis is pure feels, i have no proof at all. I just FEEL THIS WAY when i play her.\n\nHow to solve it (sorta): I think her passive is very strong, maybe tone it down a bit and tone up the synergy abilities or adding a new mechanic to them (W and R), I also feel like Q is kiiiinda useless, or just not important. i just use it to sooometimes harrass, escape by jumping walls and (the main usage) to catch off an enemy and continue my Passive chain. Well im not sure what else to include :P.","replies":[{"poster":"Miraweave","date":"2016-02-24T20:30:32.239+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"In what universe is Quinn an adc?\n\nShe plays top and occasionally mid.","replies":[{"poster":"SleepyWolfie","date":"2016-02-24T20:59:32.796+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Vortices,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=3KIOO1FY,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2016-02-24T20:30:32.239+0000)\n>\n> In what universe is Quinn an adc?\n> \n> She plays top and occasionally mid.\n\n*facepalm* There are two things to notice in this game: Roles and starting positions. \n\nRoles are well.... roles you will fufill during a match.

Gameplay wise she's much closer to being an assassin than an ADC.\n\nShe doesn't fill the role of an ADC because she tries to get to priority targets and ideally wants to splitpush. She's almost never played as a backline DPS source.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Leu07","date":"2016-02-24T19:26:44.723+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Vayne is supposed to be a late hypercarry too yet she is strong at all stages of the game, why kog cant be so too?","replies":[{"poster":"SleepyWolfie","date":"2016-02-24T19:43:02.017+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Leu07,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=3KIOO1FY,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2016-02-24T19:26:44.723+0000)\n>\n> Vayne is supposed to be a late hypercarry too yet she is strong at all stages of the game, why kog cant be\n\nThe point of this post is not strength, much less compartively to other champions (although i do think Kog is overbuffed right now), but the meaning of this post is riots precious identity. Vayne does act as a Hypercarry, she has a very weak early game (I dissapprove what you said that she is strong at all stages in the game) that slowly improves to mid game and ends up great in the late game. Proof: http://champion.gg/champion/Vayne/ADC (check her Win rate% by game length, also notice that around 92,000 games were analyzed this patch). \n\nHowever look back at Kog´Maws Win rate % by game length, it descends the longer games go. That being said, Kog´Maw is the contrary to a hypercarry. And thats the identity Riot has been trying to give him! Proof: http://champion.gg/champion/KogMaw/ADC . \n\nThat justifies my opinion, have a good day :)","replies":[{"poster":"Leu07","date":"2016-02-24T20:20:02.321+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And I disagree that vayne has a weak early too.

If he's strong in the LCS, and he's complained about in YoloQ, chances are, he's simply too strong.\n\nAs for Kog's scaling, He probably should scale a little faster than before. (As riot intended for shorter games.) Though I would honestly look at rageblade first. (As Kog isn't the only one abusing it.) \n\nNot sure what happened to AP Kog. one of the Rioter's mentioned putting power back into his ult. (Not sure why we got the AS changes instead.) Perhaps Riot wanted to target ADC Kog first. Or perhaps they just don't like AP Kog's play style. (Ult combined with Rylie's is pretty annoying.) \n\nBut given the new rage blade, and his AS steroid, I'm surprised people haven't considered the Hybrid option. Rage blade generates a fair amount AP. combined that with Tooth, and you should have good damage on both your spells, and your autos, while not being quite as mana hungry as Classic AP Kog.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SleepyWolfie","date":"2016-02-24T17:08:10.056+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Point is: If Riot is going to give an identity to Kog maw, atleast support it.
