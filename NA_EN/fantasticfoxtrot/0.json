Dynamic skill lvl bias - your skill at champion and at a role was factored into teambuilder. This allows someone in bronze to be fairly matched with someone in Diamond in theory. This increases the pool of players you can fairly be matched against, which reduces queue time\n2. Teambuilder had huge pool to begin with - Blind pick has the most players in it at any given time. Team builder actually had more than draft. Despite the fact that there are roughly 12 million accounts (and I think 700k players on in a server at any given moment on average), ranked has a ridiculously small population as opposed to the other queues. Quartering a population size doesn't necessarily reduce the number of potential valdi combinations by 75%; combinatorics just doesn't work that way. So population size has non-linear effects on queue times.\n3. And it kind of did - it did not take literal hours, but if you wanted to start a game from scratch, it was several minutes for a team + matching. It felt longer because it was active waiting, but time from creation to actual game start was roughly equivalent to Blind. But that's not what we think of when we refer to \"queue times.\" We think of the average time between queueing up and pressing accept.

Because the players could then be placed into a queue by rank/rating, and rapidly combined with a standardized team composition according to that rank (or rank range even). You can simulate this by using a deck of poker cards. Separate the cards by suit. The card values equate to a player rank/rating. Line up the cards by value and line up the suits.

It's significantly harder. While it's useful to perform algorithms on small systems to see if it works at all, large systems behave differently than small systems. Thus, you have to test it on sufficiently large systems, not small ones.\n\nDo also keep in mind that there can be as much as a 100 mmr spread within a single tier of a division, which is enough to skew what could be naively said as a fair match to have as much as 3:2 odds. And with every mmr you shave off to make the variation smaller in skill, you make the population smaller, which can disproportionately affect queue times. One of Riot's challenges is to balance queue times with consistency in game experience. Even though it's unlikely, waiting 20 minutes for a game where you expect 99.7% of the games to be even matched is fine, but if you think that the game was a stomp (whether it really was or not), waiting so long only to get a shitty game is probably going to make you quit.\n\nLet's not get started about trolls ruining games either.

Which means I drop rank like a rock. Will I still try? Sure, for a few weeks at least, and if I'm wrong, I'll be pleased, but if not I'll just have to drop Ranked and Draft and stick to Blind only. And even then its a tossup.","replies":[{"poster":"Tis a nice day","date":"2016-01-15T07:20:50.407+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm, I see.

Might as well clear my rank history all together and start over because I dont play ranked as top or support. If I did, it was because I was last pick and during that game I would play as safe as possible, not feed, make sure i showed up to teamfights and pray that my team didn't suck.","replies":[{"poster":"Myozthirirn","date":"2016-01-15T07:54:22.886+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You dont play as top or supp rigth?\nThat lets you with Jungle/Adc or Jungle/mid\nChose one of those and learn to play one more champion\nIts that easy, it will turn you from one trick pony into a glorious TWO trick pony","replies":[{"poster":"SonicSalem","date":"2016-01-15T08:15:37.516+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Myozthirirn,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=gho8Pn0A,comment-id=001a00000000000000000000,timestamp=2016-01-15T07:54:22.886+0000)\n>\n> You dont play as top or supp rigth?\n> That lets you with Jungle/Adc or Jungle/mid\n> Chose one of those and learn to play one more champion\n> Its that easy, it will turn you from one trick pony into a glorious TWO trick pony\n\nThe problem is it's not just about people who can \"only play one role\" (though those people have been screwed over by the removing of TeamBuilder). I can easily play two roles very well (Mid & Support), & I can be a decent ADC & Top. Knowing how to play two roles is not the point, the whole point of TeamBuilder is that if I wanted to play Mid, & only wanted Mid, I could be guaranteed to get that role. If I only had time for one match in a night & I just wanted to play Mid, I'd get that role in TeamBuilder, now I'm stuck playing blind pick where I have to risk on the speed of the chat load to get the one role I want, until blind pick too is taken away, & then I'm not sure what I'll be doing, probably a lot of ARAM.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
