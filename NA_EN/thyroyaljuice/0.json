He tells me that his loading screen becomes black and closes itself then the client comes back up and tells him to reconnect. He has tried re-logging and his connection is completely fine but he is unable to join the game. After the second time this happened I wanted to know if  he can still play in a custom instead of ranked but now he is unable to login into any of his accounts saying that his username and password is incorrect and it is making both of us mad. Please help us if you can.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-20T22:44:29.337+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Those black screens your friend is seeing are most likely being caused when his network is trying to connect to the game server you guys were going to be playing on.

It looks like we had a small hiccup with those login servers over night, but they should all be smoothed out at this point. If he still can't get logged back in, have him refresh his client and try then!","replies":[]}]}
