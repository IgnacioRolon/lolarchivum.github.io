However, it is not a perfect system and that is one of the main reasons for me writing this post today. To address some of the minor issues and maybe find a community solution to make the lore reach newer, better heights. \r\n\r\n**Now that we have that out of the way, let me start with all the things the new lore does right:**\r\n\r\n- Great world building- we really get a good feel of not just the champions themselves but of Valoran as a whole. The dark, secretive alleyways of Zaun and the harsh pursuit of Demacian justice.\r\n\r\n- Character development- In the retconned lore these characters all seemed a bit two dimensional, even with the journal of justice to flesh them out a little. Now they have constantly shifting priorities and motivations just like any other human.\r\n\r\n- Creates interactions in between the characters that was desperately lacking before- Just like the point before this is a crucial part of what makes a story interesting. You can&#039;t have just one main character in a story and expect it to be interesting without anyone for them to talk to. Under the old summoner system that is exactly what was happening though; characters had no real reason to talk to other faction currently in the lore so any story just seemed.... bland to be honest. That&#039;s why we marshaled around the few pieces of interesting story there was, such as the love affair of Garen and Katarina. \r\n\r\n- A constantly evolving story- I could compare the new lore system to that of a comic book, in which even when a plot point comes to a close there can always be another to take its place involving the same characters because the possibilities of character interactions are all so diverse. \r\n\r\n**Now, a few things that I have noticed that the new lore system does not deliver on quite as well**\r\n\r\n- Some characters have no reason to be in these stories- Characters like Shaco and Fiddlesticks have no real human (or demi-human) motivations guiding them, and so have no need to interact with other characters inside of the lore. This means they will either just get entire thematic and lore overhauls if the time ever comes for them to be reworked, or they will just be forgotten entirely in the world.\r\n\r\n- Lore inaccessibility- It is much harder to access all of the new lore content than it was to access the old lore. Once certain lore events end it can be incredibly difficult for the average but not fanatic fan of the game to find the information again. I just did a quick precursor look through the league of legends website and could not find any of the old Bilgewater or Shurima storylines on there. People who miss these events miss out on large parts of this worlds lore and may be demotivated to try and find it on their own.\r\n\r\n- Some lands may never be featured- From Wukong&#039;s home in the Plague Jungles to the Tempest Flats (assuming they even still exist) may never be featured in any of these events leaving large swathes of the world unexplored and blank to our knowledge. This may not be a bad thing as having a bit of mystery in the world is a good storybuilding tool, but eventually all mysteries need to be answered and I worry that these places may not be mentioned again.\r\n\r\n- Long waits in between lore events- This problem I know is inevitable as it takes a long time to write content everyone agrees is of a high enough quality to be released to the public but it is still frustrating to have to wait such a long time to learn anything new about the world. \r\n\r\nSo that about sums up the list of the positives and the negatives that I can think of, can you guys think of any solutions to any of these issues so we can make the lore even better than it already is? Or any other pros/cons for that matter.","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2016-06-09T23:40:22.663+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree strongly with the issue of it being difficult to find stories and updates after they've happened.

They are one in the same, the same continuity, it's just that's it has taken Riot a while (a long while) to gain momentum and the work that was being done back then is coming to fruition now and most likely in the near future. \n\nSecondly, I find your concern of some characters not having a purpose in the world unfound. The point of a retcon is start over from scratch, salvage what's worth keeping and building on top of that. I take comfort in knowing that Riot is going to find away to naturally fit obscure character naturally into their world. Just look at how well Ramus was incorporated into Shurima's story. Before he seemingly had no place there, but know it just feels right. In addition, I don't think this is a valid argument until you've at least seen what Riot has in store for said champions.\n\nLastly, don't think you worry that Riot won't explore their previously established locations that are lesser known is well founded. We haven't gotten through all the champions yet, so until then I wouldn't worry. Even if they do end up scrapping a previously established location for whatever reason, I feel that they would replace it with something equally as interesting to fill the empty niche.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TzQGRUST39","date":"2016-06-09T23:54:12.851+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll go through the pros and cons and give my opinion.\n\nGreat World Building- I agree, the new lore has done a very good job of making this world feel massive, both in physical size and in history. The passing teases of past events like the rune wars makes me thirsty to learn more.\n\nCharacter Development- They have done a great job with adding complexity to the old versions of our champions. All of the characters introduced to us are able to be dynamic and malleable (Aside from Skarner maybe) which gives real and scary consequence to the happenings of this world.\n\nCreates Interaction- The character interactions have been some of the best parts of the new, but it depends which instance. Illaoi in specific is a great example, it gave us insight into the mindsets of both Gangplank and Illaoi while also managing to forward the story. Some other moments (mostly in the event stories) often seem a little stilted.\n\nEvolving Story- I agree, but it is barred by how slowly lore is being produced. For example, we know many characters are about to converge in Zaun, but how long will it be until we find out what happens? A year, two? Then how long after that will we find out what happened to the characters following the event? Though we know this will probably not be the last rodeo for those heading to Zaun, it often feels like it because it'll be a safe bet that years will past until we get our hands on what the characters get into next.\n\nSome Characters are Lost- Those characters with weak motivations will definitely not keep those motivations when time comes for their lore to be written. These characters with weak or non-existent motivations (Shaco, Fiddlesticks, Jax, Evelynn) were often the ones with the most shallow characters as well. The removal of what was there of the old characters is far out-weighed by the prospect of what the new lore team can turn them into, at least for me.\n\nLore Inaccessibility- I'm pretty sure that this problem will be fixed soon. I've said this before on some other posts, but I don't mind repeating myself. The unified format that they are using to distribute the lore for each region makes me believe that there is some sort of interactive map inbound. Specifically the couple paragraph explanation of each region before getting into the individual champion lore tingles my spider-senses. If we're lucky, this map will even be tied to the new client for maximum exposure.\n\nForgotten Lands- While I'm confident that the Plague Jungles or the Voodoo Lands will never exist in the new lore, I am sure that new locations will be created to fill their previous roles and more. The Voodoo Lands in specific I imagine being similar to that of the Shadow Lands in the A Song of Ice and Fire series.\n\nOverall I feel that the lore is very good and a mighty improvement from the old.","replies":[{"poster":"Lysdexic1","date":"2016-06-10T00:14:05.990+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Czeslaw,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=234PAAzH,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2016-06-09T23:54:12.851+0000)\n\n> Some Characters are Lost- Those characters with weak motivations will definitely not keep those motivations when time comes for their lore to be written.

Those are questions that have to be thought about as the characters get remade.

Now a note, I hate the new Targon lore so that totally colors my view of it. But a problem with Targon that isn't seen in the other lores is that the champions aren't the important movers and shakers of their own lore. Just reading Pantheon, Leona, and Diana and 90% of their lore is about Atreus, and the humans Leona and Diana. Yet the big climactic moment of the lores (Diana killing the elders, Atreus on the mountain, Leona forgiving Diana) is always the Aspects doing things and the people being forced to do it.  Taric's was better. But still, the players and all the other stories were about the champions themselves not some other unseen force doing things. \n\nIf they go back and clarify the Aspects that shifts the focus even farther away from the champions that people are actually interested in and further makes them just the vehicles of the plot. It also lowers the mystic view of the Space Targs which the writers said they wanted to keep in their Foundations talk on the Targon.\n\nIt all just leads to more of a mess of the things I dislike about the Targon lore.
