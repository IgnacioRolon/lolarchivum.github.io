It&#039;s been keeping me from playing for pretty much 2 solid years, coming back every now and then when i feel like a good game of league. But the one thing that has been keeping a constantly high level of quality for the past couple of years is the lore. There was a time when everyone was hard on the lore team for lack of content, but it was well worth the wait because since that point every release by them has been engaging and of the highest quality in both writing and detail. Now all we need is a map and I can die happy. So I sincerely hope you guys are over there giving yourselves pats on the back and thank you for all your hard work.","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2017-11-07T04:32:29.354+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":">...Now all we need is a map and I can die happy.\n\nNo, no - please don't die.

While some factions have interactions with others, you can't expect everyone to know everyone.\n\nSure, everyone can now be aware of Prez Trump, but PT won't be aware of everyone, nor would everyone meet him in real life.  He is background information that could do very little for a person's background. Especially if said person is 1 of 3 billion in China.  Sure, everyone enjoys a good crossover (hell, MF, Lucian, and Olaf all appeared in the same story, like WTF), but not every crossover makes sense unless proper happenstances occur for it to work.  MF and Lucy only worked because they both have a revenge story going on (so they get to mull things over on that), and Lucy came to Bilgewater for Thresh during the Harrowing.

But if you have 3 champs from Ionia, make some of them know each other.\n\nWe also need stories that branch from the Main lore(that needs to be fixed) about the lands themselves. New stories like the Varus has so much character and interest. They have families and bonds. Noxans come to invade them and so forth. That story makes sense. Im just asking Riot to spend more time fixing the old champion 'stories'. Thanks for your input.","replies":[{"poster":"Valaran Nara","date":"2017-12-03T20:00:32.987+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Sëtíer,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=yrE1gOGU,comment-id=000100010000,timestamp=2017-12-03T17:00:14.833+0000)\n\nAw! Okay, I see.  Here's the thing: the \"League\" does not exist.\n\nThe Institute of War does not exist\n\nThe game you play on the rift is not canon\n\nThis was Retconned in 2014.\n\nAll this new lore we are getting is BECAUSE the IOW no longer exists.  I believe the main story you are referring to no longer exists as for as post retcon is concerned.  With that being said, I am still waitin for some more champion interactions in lore to occur.\n\nThe last time we had some good lore with them interacting with each other I think was Bloodline. I could be wrong though, but I believe that was the only solid one unless you want to count color stories.","replies":[{"poster":"Sëtíer","date":"2017-12-05T15:27:39.411+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thats what I fear, is that Riot doesnt CARE to make any League or Institute of War, they mentioned it years ago. I absolutely agree with what you said there should be some champ interactions. \n My MAIN question is... Where does the rift come from? Where is it located? what gives it the magic properties so you can die over and over again?\nthe League of Legends = Leagues of players(bronze-challenger/pro) summoning champions for fun just to fight. Whats the point of the fighting? Why are certain people in the rift and some not? \n\nThe new Varus story is awesome. But how does that make him a chosen 'champion' for the rift? \nWe need questions answered!!!","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Nik Nikerson","date":"2017-12-03T15:15:03.972+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"What about the new lore doesn't make sense?\n\nAnd everything not fitting together may be in part due to the fact half the characters still have their old, bare-bones, kind of generic lore, and haven't been updated to fit into the new narrative.","replies":[]}]}]}
