But instead of saying I ranked up to S3 at the end game, it said Victory +20 LP and put me back to 88LP in S4. Can I get some help on this one?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-03T21:19:47.164+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That sounds like a really strange case, so I looked into this for you.  It really pains me to say that it looks like you had 2 [queue dodges](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751844-Queue-Dodging) in a row as soon as you got into your series.  Another loss put you down to 68 LP then a win which has you at your current 88 LP.  \n\nIt really sucks to see that happens, but let me know if there's some issue causing these dodges.  I'm happy to help troubleshoot any possible technical issues.  Good luck on your next run!","replies":[{"poster":"Jhìñ","date":"2017-02-03T21:55:32.020+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see :( \nWell thank you for looking into that for me. I did have some network issues earlier which made me dodge the queues. \nI guess I'll just get back to the grind stone and make my way up again.\nThanks again!","replies":[]}]}]}
