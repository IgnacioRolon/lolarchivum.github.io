I'm a Bronze support main (yes, yes, too wood to have an opinion, automatically invalid, w/e, idc, move on if you're going to comment on the player and not the post), and I play her, but I don't see a lot of other Jannas, it's true. Mind, it's hard for me to judge general population of support players at my level, as I only ever see one other support player in any given game at _most_ - often not even that, because autofill trolls. But yeah, certainly seems most want to play rawr damage or engage supports (ignoring Janna's amazing flash-ult engage for the time being...). That said, the situations where even I can actually _play_ Janna are very limited, since I have to be able to trust at least one other member of my team to do their job. Doesn't even have to be an ADC, just... someone. Anyone. Janna is a force multiplier, but multiplying by zero still gets you nothing.\n\nThere are other peel supports, though. {{champion:25}} is generally on peel duty in teamfights when she's not forced into the engage role, and most other supports can peel to one degree or another (ex. {{champion:201}} {{champion:223}} {{champion:44}} {{champion:432}} {{champion:117}} {{champion:267}} ). As long as you have someone who's not the support who's engaging, peel shouldn't be hard to come by. Of course, if the support is stuck engaging, there's less we can do to protect our ADC. :(\n\nIssue is actually finding someone who is truly playing the support role rather than discount laner. That doesn't even necessarily mean \"not AP\" or \"utility items only\" or whatever. It has more to do with role. Zyra, for instance, does tons of damage as a support, but there's a clear difference in mindset between a Zyra who builds no SS, goes straight into full damage from Frostfang, and focuses on foes vs. a Zyra who runs Eye of the Watchers, takes some early CDR/rushes Rylai's, places plants to zone foes as well rather than simply kill them, and holds her E for divers and assassins. Both claim to be support, both do and even build damage, both contribute similarly to killing people, but their positioning and general role is totally different. _That's_ your issue. Is your Thunderlord's/Lich Bane Sona a support, or a burst mage? Builds can be identical, lane position can be identical, but behavior, mindset, and goals give it away. The Sona who chases kills and always uses her Q-passive is totally different from the one who's moving around the team setting up wards for fights and carefully picking her passive targets for proper teamfight management. Kill Sona will generally try to position more safely but aggressively, whereas support Sona might take more defensive positions, be willing to bodyblock, make sure she tags the right people with her auras, etc. Even \"dedicated\" supports like Soraka, Janna, etc. play completely differently based on mindset.\n\nThat's part of why peel is so hard to come by. It's like a jungler who doesn't care about turrets. They're not in the jungle, no, but the goal is full objective control, not just jungle objective control. Even supports playing \"supporty\" supports can be fairly ineffective at their role if they don't understand that their job is more complex than just \"heal/shield/buff/CC people\". They can still succeed, just like the Zac jungle who does nothing but gank can succeed, but they're missing a big part of the role. Without the right mindset in their support, the ADC can feel weak, vulnerable, and left behind.\n\nIt goes both ways, of course. I usually have ADCs who are way too gung-ho, or expect me to hold their hand 100% of the time, or who can't stand to stay under tower long enough for me to ward/roam, or what have you. Those sorts of ADCs make playing support feel yucky at times, and it makes the position much less appealing. They make me not want to help them or focus on peeling for them, and often they'll put me in a position where I have to focus my support on someone else to do anything. Both lane partners _will_ either actively inhibit or support the other. Not bearing that in mind makes for a messy duo bot, messy teamfights, terrible map control, and the \"adcs in 2017\" thing where the position feels stressful and non-impactful.\n\nHopefully this hasn't been too rambling. Sorta written at 1 AM, and so I opted for more info to make sure I made my point clear, but I recognize that's also made it a bit WoT-y. >.>","replies":[{"poster":"Sp33d Zer0","date":"2017-02-10T07:32:50.149+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your opinion is valid no matter your rank.

First, where the support should position depends on the support, the adc, and how they function as a unit, not to mention other factors like junglers and roaming mids and whatnot. If I'm Morgana, you're Varus, and we're into a Vayne/Nami lane, you do not want me in front of you. You want me off to the side where I can consistently slip a Q around the minion wave onto Vayne when she goes to engage on you, and where I can easily screen you from either ganks or Vayne Es depending on the side and situation even when my E is down. On the other hand, into a Blitz, you _definitely_ want me in front of you ofc.\n\nThat sorta works into the second point, which is this: I can't stand in front of my ADC if my ADC is standing too close to wave. Sorta plays into the \"why is my adc ahead of me\" question you don't want me to ask. If I'm a tank, sure, I can stand a little dangerously close to wave and take some poke, but it's too easy to get caught and killed senselessly if I try to screen and bodyblock for an ADC who refuses to give me room to do so. It's less horrible with something like an Ezreal, but if a Jinx or Kog or someone stands inside our own minion wave, my job becomes nearly impossible.\n\nI agree that bot lane is lost more to a lack of synergy than anything else, but part of that is because there's not a hard and fast rule for all situations. It's not the support's job to unthinkingly stand in front of the adc, and it's not the adc's job to position any way they prefer and expect their support to just deal with it. Of course, doesn't help that your chances of running into an actual support main - never mind one who thinks in those terms - are fairly low. >.>","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Mike17032","date":"2017-02-10T03:55:28.519+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"What's a front line?
