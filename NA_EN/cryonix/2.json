If you mean the Boards, your profile should show your standing in the previous season's ranked.  You should also be able to see someone's current standing by mousing over a friend on your friend's list, or checking their profile in the client.  Let me know if that clears things up.","replies":[{"poster":"Piltover Customs","date":"2017-03-22T23:47:59.095+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He means \"Bronze Porocles\" :P for his IGN.","replies":[{"poster":"Cryonix","date":"2017-03-22T23:51:25.418+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"something like that :) thx Piltover","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-23T00:00:43.334+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh no, I'd be Wooden Porocles.  :P  This isn't currently a feature, but it's a neat idea.  I think having titles as part of your Summoner Name is a cool concept along with club tags.  I'm not part of the development team so I wouldn't know anything about that, though.  Since the updated client is still in testing, share your idea over at the [client discussion](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/alpha-client-discussion) boards and let your voice be heard.
