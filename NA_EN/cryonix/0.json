Because people are asking \"are you so and so\" and they reply \"yes i am\" like they basically posing as them. And those that count for streamer as well ? I'm just curious about all this because sometimes i get excited or i just get so upset that it's not them.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-14T17:00:56.355+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"We don't really mind players having a tag with their own name, but it may become a problem if they're deliberately trying impersonate someone.  We'll also consider changing it if a specific team asks us to.  If you run into cases like this in a game, be sure to report it so we can take a look at each case individually.  Hope that helps clear some things up!","replies":[{"poster":"Cryonix","date":"2017-04-14T19:55:01.061+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Will do thanks for replying :)","replies":[]}]}]}
