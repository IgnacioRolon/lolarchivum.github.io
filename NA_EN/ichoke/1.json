Happens 2-3 times per game. On top of that, I'm sitting at around 140 FPS as well. In the past, I've been getting 200-250 FPS consistently. I know the FPS issues may seem like a miniscule issue, but it's something I've noticed along with my fps drops. I've changed my Hard Drive from a HDD to SD about 2 months ago, but I never had any issues when I made the change. Symptoms occurred 2 weeks ago. I haven't changed any PC habits either. Chrome is always up. A stream is always up on 480p. Any help would be appreciated thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Son of Ornn","date":"2017-05-28T04:50:46.495+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even with that dent out of your FPS, we're still kinda jealous of those numbers. xD\n\nWhile Chrome shouldn't be a problem, streaming at the same time as playing LoL can be stressful on your comp and affect FPS. Even if this is a new development, try testing your frames in Custom games and compare FPS while streaming against not streaming. I also suggest running through the steps in [**this guide here**](http://riot.com/2dlHSAF); they can be really helpful in most cases of FPS drops!\n\nKeep in touch with me if these tips help or not and on any new developments. :J","replies":[]}]}
