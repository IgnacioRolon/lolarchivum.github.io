Or are you putting that off for another patch in favor of stability for Worlds?\r\n\r\nI wouldn&#039;t blame you, back before the changes to her E she was super broken, and the value of stability for Worlds is definitely something to consider.","replies":[{"poster":"Madra","date":"2015-09-04T01:47:19.293+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Sorry, LoL community... if you wanted bigger buffs than +Mana per level; you should have bought more Queen of Heart Syndra skins.","replies":[{"poster":"Cerulean Laser","date":"2015-09-04T08:10:37.051+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Madra,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=tGfHjXXb,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2015-09-04T01:47:19.293+0000)\n>\n> Sorry, LoL community... if you wanted bigger buffs than +Mana per level; you should have bought more Queen of Heart Syndra skins.\n\nAtlantean all day.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2015-09-04T08:35:15.617+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":0,"body":"Justicar 4 life.","replies":[{"poster":"warpenguin555","date":"2015-09-04T15:35:44.410+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=tGfHjXXb,comment-id=000300000000,timestamp=2015-09-04T08:35:15.617+0000)\n>\n> Justicar 4 life.\n\nSee.

We've also got a fix in for certain cases where spheres near, but not past, max E range wouldn't get knocked back.\n\nThat might be it for 5.18, though the balance team's still got a few more days to iterate before we need to lock the patch down.

I think it's a bit silly that her base damage on Q is less then her auto attack damage... Like... come on now that's just silly... technically she can auto about 3 times in the cooldown of her q and do more damage then one q even with a dorians ring level 1. I think even just a super small buff to the damage on Q could fix her. Not like it was before but I think when you guys nerfed her Q damage before you went a bit overboard... especially when there are champions with spells that have the same cooldown but are better. Cassiopeia's q does more damage and has more range and about the same delay.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MÆGÉ ÇRÅƒT","date":"2015-09-05T06:29:08.972+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why is it that when ever syndra finallu gets her turn for a buff she end up with whack bug fixes and weak buffs?
