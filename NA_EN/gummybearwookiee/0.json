Or add it to the DJ Sona page.\nIt was pretty confusing and seem to not be alone since this keep coming up in forums.\nInstructions say to hit TAB then hit music icon by Sona's icon, everyone assuming Sona icon in middle cause that's what pops up when you hit TAB.\nMaybe also remove the hit tab part of the process since the Sona icon where you have to click is there even when you don't hit tab. Guess maybe that could lead to a few misclicks? Not likely though since it's off in a corner.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vampy3k","date":"2015-03-02T17:50:36.763+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not on the scorecard.
