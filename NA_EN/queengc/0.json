I'm broke, but after a few months, my dad got me a new computer. It's a pretty old computer and has parental controls but its okay. I keep trying to download League Of Legends, but the file won't open when it's done. I've tried running as an administrator, but it wouldn't even open up. Is it because of parental controls, or the age of the computer, or is there a solution?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-27T23:20:46.071+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Try navigating to where the download was saved, right clicking and running it as an administrator there. If that doesn't help, try redownloading it again in case it wasn't fully downloaded or was damaged in the process.\n\nLet me know if you still can't get it installing and we might be able to get you a different method of installing the game through a ticket.","replies":[]}]}
