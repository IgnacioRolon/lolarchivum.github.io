The ticket was meant to ask if they could change the name into what you wanted it to be, sorry for that confusion. \n\nLike I mentioned in the first reply, the agents should be able to help change the name into what you meant to, but they can't simply refund name changes. I'd go back to the ticket and clarify you didn't need a refund and you just needed the name to be what you originally wanted without the typo, but again, it'll be up to your EUNE agents.\n\nEDIT: I'll also reach out to that agent myself and let them know what's going on to help alleviate any confusion and help you along fam ^_^","replies":[{"poster":"Infamous King","date":"2018-01-19T02:01:39.837+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ty so much bro if u can add me on facebook we will text there martin hadzov\ni dont think the will hellp me but..","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Infamous King","date":"2018-01-19T00:10:24.894+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"eh im still panicing cuz i didint wanted to change my name i was just trying to how its looking like so i hope they will gve my blue essence back and my old name .. im in panic man\nyep i","replies":[]},{"poster":"Infamous King","date":"2018-01-18T22:46:01.918+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"eh im still panicing cuz i didint wanted to change my name i was just trying to how its looking like so i hope they will gve my blue essence back and my old name .. im in panic man","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Tahminatrix ","date":"2018-01-18T03:00:28.212+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"cant you use one of your 3 refunds?","replies":[{"poster":"Infamous King","date":"2018-01-18T03:41:02.906+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"what do u think will they help me ? :P","replies":[]},{"poster":"Infamous King","date":"2018-01-18T03:39:51.704+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i laredy used them sadly :( im panicing ..\nhope Riot Games will help me :(","replies":[]}]}]}
