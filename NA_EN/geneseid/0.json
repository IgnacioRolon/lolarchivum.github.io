When designing Selena I wanted to truly delve into a fantasy that means something to me personally. Mage classes - specifically those from role playing games like Dragon Age - have always been the go to class for me in terms of what I was playing. My idea was to express how these ferocious battle mages are displayed in role playing games, controlling fights and devastating opponents with powerful spells._\n\n_ I wanted Selena to be a presentation of a battle mage. A ranged sorceress that stays in the midst of fights and continues to waddle down her opponents with a barrage of fire balls, leaving no time to react before they are inevitably consumed in the flames. With this in mind I continued to express my fantasy throughout her kit and lore to the best of my capabilities. My primary focus when designing every aspect of Selena was to be as unique and as different as possible in order to really bring her to life. Mages don't have many restrictions as other classes - as evidenced by Zoe - so there's an abundance of room to be creative. Any and all comments and constructive criticism is greatly appreciated and welcomed._\n\n>___\n\n**Splash Art**\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/cKHnYoH.jpg\n\n\n**Login Music**\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go6bENkQZyc\n\n**Disclaimer:** _I take zero credit for any of the artwork displayed.

Residing at the peak of Mount Targon, she stands watch as a stalwart protector over those gifted with - or by - magic, barraging any and all who would mean them harm with cosmic hellfire. Selena sees it as her destiny to ensure magic continues to thrive on Runeterra and will stop at nothing and no one on her path. Those who challenge the Phoenix Born bare witness to a form of celestial power thought to have been extinct for millennia._\n\n**Annals Of The Phoenix**\n\n____\n\n_In Runeterra's most ancient history, there existed a race of elemental demigods: mystical embodiment's of elements of fire and ice. These creatures, known as the phoenixs, were among the first forms of sentient life to appear on Runeterra. Being a species that is highly intelligent, sophisticated and practically immortal, they lived in tranquility with every other species on the planet, many seeking to indulge in their own godly duties and some growing an emotional attachment to the mortals they inspired with awe._\n\n_As the Rune Wars started to subside, many people across Runeterra would come to view their winged neighbors with fear and suspicion. After years of pain and suffering brought by objects of immense magical power - The World Runes -, the awe inspired view mortals previously held began to manifest into hate and jealousy. Runeterra's primitive  inhabitants would become so distraught of the phoenix race that hordes of people would hunt them over the next generations. Despite being a nigh immortal species that is reborn upon death, this reincarnation cycle has it's limits. Over the millennia a vast majority of the winged entities would migrate from Runettera entirely, never to be seen again. Only one particular cryophoenix - Anivia - would continue to guard over mortal lives as her brothers and sisters departed._ \n\n_Millenia passed since the phoenix population abandoned their previous home, leaving virtually no trace of their existence and venturing into realities beyond mortal comprehension. Runeterra's last pyrophoenix - an ancient being named Adara - was never reborn, or so those that contributed to her murder would think. In the many years proceeding her demise, people of Runeterra would continue to view magic similarly to how their ancestors viewed their previous demigods, some with utter fascination and some with bitter consternation._\n\n**The Phoenix Born**\n\n____\n\n_Born in the northern protectorate of Demacia known as Jandelle, Selena grew up as an outcast among her fellow Demacians. Even though the people of her town - and nation - were proud, strong and peaceful, many had a distrust of magic she found herself unable to cope with or abide by. As a young girl, her mother would tell her tales of some of Runeterra's most defining magical events, including the Rune Wars and the cataclysm that gave birth to the Shadow Isles. They served to instill a sense of fear into her daughter, while at the same time bestow upon her knowledge of the outside world and how dangerous magic can be. Her mother's fear mongering tales proved ineffective and in some ways were counter intuitive, as Selena retained her fascination with magic in spite of everything she had been told._\n\n_Demacian's have many duties and responsibilities to their families and to their nation, but despite this Selena would often spend her free time in Jandelle's library, reading of the many magical entities that shaped the very surface of Runeterra itself. While her fellow Demacian youth would spend their time wandering the town's beautiful outskirts, she had become knowledgeable in virtually everything her kingdom had to teach in regards to magic. However, the knowledge she had attained through all those months and years of unremitting study proved futile in quenching her thirst for obtaining more._ \n\n_On Selena's sixteenth birthday, she persuaded her parents to give her permission to travel to the Placidium of Navori. Her parents - thinking this was just their daughter expressing her desire to break the boundaries formed for her as a child, allowed her to pursue her wish. But unknown to them was Selena had been planning to visit the School of Transcendentalism, an organization dedicated to raising Runeterra’s populace to the greatest spiritual heights possible._\n\n_Through years of study Selena had come to learn a great deal of Ionian culture and became deeply fascinated with it. Unlike her fellow Demacian's, Ionians' viewed magic as a blessing upon all those graced by it's beauty. To her, this was the very manifestation of paradise on Runeterra, one where she'd be free to enlighten herself without fear of censure._\n\n_After weeks of preparation, Selena sent off to traveling to Ionia and making her dream a reality. She had spent weeks there studying some of Ionia’s most respected scholars, some going as far as to say she may as well be one of them. Selena viewed the Placidium as a place of utmost harmony, one where her inner being was free to escape the psychological shackles bestowed by Demacian propaganda._\n\n_On the final day of her stay at the Placidium, Selena was scheduled to mediate with one of her many teachers that had been her guide for weeks. As she meditated, she focused on the spiritual aspect of all things in existence, her mother, father, country, classmates, the Placidium and even herself. The meditation chamber began to surge with spiritual energy as she levitated into the air, her instructor observing in awe. The very heavens were quaking with the reawakening of a long forgotten celestial being, Selena's hair seemingly transmuting into strands of fiery orange._  \n\n_As the room became to hot for her guide to stay within proximity of Selena, she would be snapped out of her spiritual meditation by none other than Soraka herself: one of the Placidium's many governing regents. As she fell to the floor, her very palms were engulfed in scorching hot flames and eyes glowing as if she were imbued with lava. Seeing the confused girl in a state of pure panic, Soraka went about soothing her agony with a touch of her cosmic hand._\n\n_Soraka explained to Selena the nature of what occurred and what it truly meant in the grand scope of things: she was born with the soul of a phoenix. While naturally fascinated with the realm of celestial entitie,  Selena was could not fathom what this revelation could mean for herself and for her family back in Demacia. As Soraka continued to tell the young hybrid of her vast capabilities, Selena's fear of what Demacia would do to her should they ever found out exacerbated. Before the starchild could conclude what she was saying, Selena thanked the her guide and the celestial wanderer before making her leave from Ionia._\n\n_On the voyage back to Jandelle, Selena contemplated over her newfound abilities. To her, it was a sign that she was destined for something far greater, that her earliest years of being an outcast among her fellow citizens of Demacia meant something. She continued this deep train of thought as she made the short trip through the outskirts back to her hometown, but as she was traversing the abandoned road she was ambushed by a coven of rogue mages._\n\n_The mages looked upon the girl with malicious intent before beginning their attack. Unwilling to subdue to their desires or retreat, Selena conjured a ray of fiery plasma and hurled it towards their formation, devastating the surrounding area before the mages could even counter attack. As they retaliated with a plethora of their own spells, Selena harnessed the inner phoenix within and amplified her defense, easily shrouding off their attacks. A duo of dagger wielding assassins made their way from Selena's flank, but before they could get within reach of the phoenix born she swayed each away with a wave of repelling flame. The battle was fiercely fought for what would feel like hours, before a squadron of Demacian soldiers led by Garen Crownguard arrived at the fiery scene._ \n\n_As the Demacian troops made their way to the battlefield, Selena continued to defend herself from her assailants who simply wouldn't back down. Seeing the oncoming Demacian troops they started to retreat, but as they abandoned the battle their leader taunted Selena for arriving to late to save her family. They had been stalking the young girl for years, having gathered knowledge that she was in fact a phoenix born and among the most powerful magical marvels on Runeterra._\n\n_Heartbroken, Selena unleashed her full might and called upon a barrage of novas that rained upon her adversaries, completely liquidating them. After maneuvering around a field of fire and destruction, the troops finally arrived in the heart of the battle, but before they could have any influence on what was going on Selena disappeared into the flames, never to be seen again._\n\n_The engagement left Selena wounded and emotionally saddened at the death of her family, but at the same time almost relieved. She had spent her whole life wondering what her place in the world would be, but it had never occurred to her that she didn't have a real place among the inhabitants of Runeterra to begin with. She was part pyrophoenix - a race of nigh omnipotent beings with sheer dominance over the element of fire, but she still retained the view that magic is majestic and doesn't deserve to be feared. It's a gift to those who wield it, but it's also a weapon of incomprehensible proportions to those who would manipulate it. When she came to this realization, a magical vision appeared to her within her mind, one of a towering mountain that ascended into celestial territory. She remembered the palm of the being that subdued her confusion at the Placidium, only acknowledging now that Soraka had done more than what she originally thought. She was not of Demacia and not even of humanity, but of a race of beings that soared over all of Runeterra, where her innermost capabilities were virtually limitless. This mountain would be her nest, one where she keep a vigilant eye over all of those blessed with the beauty of magic._\n\n**A Tale Of Fire: I** \n\n___\n\n_She had been tirelessly following her trail the entire night, but would not back down until she found this little innocent girl and returned her to safety._\n\n_\"Tibbers!\" she heard as the blackening trees to her north began to light with fire. _\n\n_Selena hasted towards the sound of the poor girl's cries, arriving just in time to join the the fray. Tibbers had been defending Annie to the death from a vile nightshade: a monstrous being that had been praying upon those coated with the aroma of magic. _\n\n_ It had been determined to find a fresh meal in Annie, slowly approaching the crying toddler as she stood transfixed in a fetal position._\n\n_\"The phoenix commands you to step away from her!\" Selena said as she conjured a fireball and hurled it towards the creature before it could get any closer to Annie's location._\n\n\n_The nightshade - viewing Selena as a force above what it could possibly hope to handle, retreated back the nocturnal darkness of the forest, never to be seen again. It had endured weeks without a fresh meal and would surely starve to death, but the concept of death was all the more merciful than the antagonizing heat that would follow should it challenge the phoenix born._\n\n_\"It's okay little one, I'm here and nothing and no one will ever scare you again\" she said as she went in to comfort sobbing Annie, who had been inspired with hope at Selena's actions - viewing her as a mother figure that cared enough to ignore her fiery abilities and see her as what she truly was: a child. _\n\n_\"You're just like me\" Annie said as she rose to her feet and looked up upon Selena with total awe. Never before had she encountered someone with such genuine kindness and compassion._\n\n_\"Yes I am child\" Selena said as she formed a miniature flame from her hand as Annie observed with glee._\n\n_As Annie's tears began to cease, she grabbed her bear Tibbers and was guided out of the woods by Selena. It had taken a whole night without an ounce of sleep to simply get the young girl to safety, but it was worth it. She wasn't the only one gifted that had been neglected and left for dead, nor would she be the last._\n\n**A Tale Of Fire: II**\n\n___\n\n_If the stories were true then it was going to be her toughest challenge yet, but one she would overcome even if it meant her death._\n\n_\"Everything's on fire ... my home ... my town\" the man said as he crumbled to the phoenix born's feet. She had seen a fear instilled into his eye's unlike anything she had encountered before. _\n\n_As Selena continued to approach the village that was in need of magical assistance, she saw as it was completely devastated with scorching hot flames as if someone had sprayed it with a torrent of lava. This didn't stop her, as her very soul was of a heat that dwarfed whatever she could be faced with._\n\n_\"If it isn't the savior, the care taker, the phoenix born\" Brand sarcastically said as he continued to spray his surroundings with flames, including innocent lives pleading for mercy._\n\n_\"Mount Targon has judged you spirit, you must stop what you're doing or suffer the consequences\" Selena said as she took formation, ready to take whatever the vengeful spirit was prepared to throw at her._\n\n_\"You cannot judge a fire, you can only hope it will stop spreading\" he said as he conjured a vast fire ball and hurled it to Selena, manically laughing as it exacerbated the destruction he had already inflicted._\n\n_Selena called upon the phoenix and formed a magical barrier around herself, absorbing the flames and redirecting them back to Brand's position. Would it even be worth it? After all, what she was facing was fire in itself._\n\n_They continued to battle at a stalemate for hours, the entire village itself reminiscent of an erupting volcano. Although Selena had spent beforehand ensuring as many villagers escaped from the town as possible, she couldn't help but feel her attempts at nullifying the problem were only making it worse._\n\n_No. There was no time to dread on any feeling because she is the phoenix born: a cosmic guardian that stood watch over all of those magical in need. She had to stop Brand by whatever means necessary._\n\n_\"I've had enough!\" she said as her voice echoed with cosmic might as if the phoenix itself was talking in unison with her. As Brand continue to bombard her defense with fire, he looked above as he saw a glare of light fall upon him, engulfing him entirely in cosmic residue._ \n\n_Selena looked at Brand, defeated and incapacitated but unwilling to back down. Before he could react she formed a whirlwind of heat as Brand attempted to counter attack, but before any amount of flame could leave his palms he found himself being absorbed into Selena's twirling inferno. The burning vengeance had finally been subdued, for the time being._\n\n_\"Fires like you may exist to consume, but I serve to liberate\" Selena said as she proceeded to put out the many flames that encompassed the entire area around her. The village was virtually decimated and many innocent lives were lost, but the raging flame was finally put to rest._ \n\n>___\n\n**Design Philosophy**\n\n___\n\n_Selena can be described as \"different\" when it comes to every other mage in League's roster. When i first set out to designing Selena, I wanted her to be as unique and distinctive as possible while also introducing a play style that one could enjoy. The first step was to make her a mage, as mage classes are typically the most unique and thematic (Zoe, Azir) and thus allow for designers to be as creative as possible._\n\n_The second step was to find a way to separate her from Annie &amp; Brand despite being fire themed, because if summoners felt as if they were playing the same champions then it would defeat the purpose for her existing. Annie &amp; Brand are two champions that defined by the incredible amount of burst they offer, so with Selena I thought to myself \"What if there was a fire themed mage that - instead of outright erasing her opponents, slowly barraged them with a rain of fire until they inevitably fell?\" _\n\n_In order to accomplish this vision I wanted her to be more about sustained damage and utility rather than outright burst. When playing Selena, summoners should feel like they are continuously bombarding their opponents with fireballs leaving no room for leeway. Opposite to Annie, Brand and most other mages, who once you do your full combo with are left at a weakened state afterwards. Selena doesn't retreat like most mages, given tools and methods for dealing with adversaries most others of her class absolutely dread._\n\n>___\n\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/g9AD2hn.png **Innate - Cosmic Barrage**\n\n___\n　     　　         \n**Passive:** _After casting an ability, Selena's next 2 basic attacks within 4 seconds are modified into magic damage, deal bonus magic damage on hit, and apply spell effects.

Bombard your opponents with well calculated Ray Of The Sun's and radiate their health away with Cosmic Barrage basic attacks. If you're opponent tries to retaliate, gracefully flame them out of your your god like presence with Reprising Inferno as you continue to apply Cosmic Barrage and build up stacks of Blessing Of The Phoenix. _\n\n_If you find yourself in need of fiery assistance in the heat of battle, well utilized Celestial Aegis' will fend off some of your opponents assaults as you maneuver yourself out of harms way with Blessing Of The Phoenix's movement speed bonus.

Use it wisely in between ability casts to maximize your damage output._\n* _Blessing Of The Phoenix grants Selena the ability to kite her opponents more efficiently when at max stacks. When you find yourself in a skirmish ensure that you retain 4 stacks when possible, allowing for you to maneuver around the battle more swiftly._\n* _Ray Of The Sun - when properly cast -  amplifies your damage against your opponent during for a short duration. Use it to engage fights with your enemies, following up with Cosmic Barrage._\n* _Celestial Aegis' passive will not only bolster the strength of the ability's shield, but any shield that Selena is affected by, making her deceivingly durable in the heat of battle._\n* _Celestial Aegis' active is at its greatest potential when you are critically low on health. Save it for when you find yourself being overwhelmed, absorbing a hefty amount of damage before disengaging with Reprising Inferno - or reengaging with Ray Of The Sun and Cosmic Barrage._ \n* _Phoenix Nova is your most versatile ability. Use it to soften up wounded opponents, follow up on engages made by your allies or disengage entire fights._ \n\n>___\n\n**Recommended Items**\n\n___\n\n**Starting**\n{{item:1056}} {{item:2003}}\n\n**First Buys**\n{{item:3020}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3116}} \n\n**Core**\n{{item:3020}} {{item:3116}} {{item:3040}} {{item:3100}} {{item:3115}} \n\n**Situational**\n{{item:3151}} {{item:3135}} {{item:3165}} {{item:3030}} \n\n**Defensive**\n{{item:3157}} {{item:3102}}{{item:3027}} {{item:3025}} \n\n>____\n\n**Potential Ability Combos**\n\n___\n\n* Poke Combo: _Q - A - A _\n\n* Heavy Disengage Combo: _W (movement speed passive increase) - E Knock Back_\n\n* \"Burst\" Combo: Q - E Knock Back - R - A - A  \n\n* Kite Combo: _E Knock Back - A - A - R - W (with Blessing Of The Phoenix movement speed increase) - A - A _\n\n* Immediate Engage Combo: _R - Q - A - A - A_\n\n* Late Game Continuous Damage Combo: _Q - A - A - A - repeat_ \n\n>___\n\n\n**Good With**\n\n___\n\n{{champion:40}}: _Because Janna has one of the most powerful shields in the game that also grants attack damage, this makes her one of Selena's most valuable magical assets.

Overall a great asset to her play style._\n\n**Bad Against**\n\n___\n\n{{champion:157}}: _She simply lacks the tools to keep Yasuo at bay for long and his Wind Wall nullifies her kit. She will continuously die to him if she doesn't play her cards extremely carefully_\n\n{{champion:103}}: _Ahri has the means to maneuver all around Selena to prevent her from landing anything. She also wins in short trades as she has innate sustain and superior burst._\n\n{{champion:38}}: _Kassadin has a magic shield - which nullifies her damage, and the means to engage onto of her and disengage from her with relative ease._ \n\n{{champion:36}}: _Can stick onto Selena easily while ignoring her attempts at kiting while simultaneously healing any damage she manages to inflict on him._\n\n{{champion:164}}: _Camille's true damage completely counters Selena's damage reduction and she has more than enough means to stick to her with relative ease. She also has means of absorbing Selena's entire assault through her passive. _\n\n{{champion:39}}: _Does extra damage against shields and is ridiculously mobile and tanky. Irelia's disarm also affects Selena moreso than other mages because of how she's basic attacks oriented. _\n\n\n>___\n\n\n**Quotes**\n\n____\n\n**Pick**\n_\"Magic is peace, magic is freedom, freedom must be protected.\"_\n\n**Ban**\n_\"See you around summoner.\"_ \n\n**First Movement**\n_\"They threaten the tranquility of those gifted, they must be eradicated.\"_\n_\"My flames open eyes.\"_\n_\"Alas, my destiny calls for me.\"_\n_\"One way or another, the path we're on reveals our inner selves.\"_\n\n**Movement**\n_\"I have traveled far and wide, but there is still so much to discover.\"_\n_\"I do not wish harm upon them, but it is a necessary evil for the greater good.\"_\n_\"Fire doesn't consume, it liberates.\"_\n_\"I cannot simply bare witness to the intolerance of those gifted._\"\n_\"Magic is a gift, not a curse.\"_\n_\"I may have a soul born of fire, but my heart is of the utmost purity.\"_\n_\"The weight of my own destiny dwarfs the destruction my fiery presence could bring them.\"_\n_\"I do not rest when others are in need of my protection.\"_\n_\"They seek to challenge me?

A champions abilities should synergise well without stacking too much. An example of this is Malzahar: His E gives aggro from his W then his ult refreshes the E and pins them in place while his W and E do their work. You can throw this entire combo out and only do 40-50% of the targets hp (weaker then it should be but even when it wasn't it was only going to do 70%) and this is on a single target.\nNow look at your champion. Her passive alone gives more buffs then most mages entire kits, not to mention the rest of her kit giving increased damage, cc, knockback, stun, mr shred, slow, shield, damage reduction and burn... \nWhat you have created here could abuse any number of items/rune/combos to do stupidly high damage with little risk. She could actually fill almost any role (you never know with jungle until you try xD).\n\nThis isn't to say I dislike the champion. The concept is cool, and the abilities, when toned down, could be really good. I just think you need to think of it like this:\nWho is she meant to do well against? At the moment I don't think there is a champion she wouldn't do well against...\nWho is she meant to be countered by? No one yet, but hopefully soon :)\nWhat role is she meant to fill? Any except maybe jungle.\nWhat debuffs does she have inherently that should be filled by item choices/be left out? Malzahar E would work so much better with a 40% inherent slow. that doesn't mean he should have it :) \n\n\nLook forward to seeing which direction you take her :)","replies":[{"poster":"Geneseid","date":"2018-06-12T07:30:56.095+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I appreciate your response (I have been working on tuning down some of her abilities), but I think I should explain what exactly her true weaknesses are and how one can abuse them.\n\nHer range in itself is pathetic, but this is intended. The only ability that is above her auto attack range is her Q and her ultimate, but everything else is moreso for when she's in battle with melee opponents kiting them out. She gets absolutely destroyed by anyone with range. \n\nHer cool downs are all also formulated so that she's naturally weaker in the early game (when her W and E are on cool down in the laning phase literally anyone is free to engage on her provided they can - she may have a long basic attack range but she's still as squishy as any other mage) and has a low base mana on top of a semi spam play style. If she simply blows away her abilities she will go oom and be dead meat to anyone with engage. Since she's dealing a majority of her damage with basic attacks (intended, her abilities naturally have lower base damages and scalings than a traditional mage) she's the rare case where a mage would want to stay within dangerous proximity of someone that would one shot them (like Zed or Talon). While Ziggs would be as far away from Zed as possible throwing Bouncing Bombs from afar, Selena would be within auto attack range of his getting Cosmic Barrage's off as she uses Reprising Inferno and Celestial Aegis to brush him off. Of course Zed has options too, using R to dodge virtually anything (like her knockback), switching shadows to dodge skill shots and overall being able to easily disengage. \n\nI'd say her biggest counters are champions that are inherently good at sticking onto targets no matter how hard you try to peel them off (Camille, Irelia, Olaf, Yasuo) because she doesn't have escapes, but means of peeling people off her and kiting. She'd be good against targets that your typical adc has decency kiting. She's essentially an ability power adc, but because she's a mage she's not given tools that adcs naturally have to handle their targets (their basic attacks naturally hurt because they build attack damage, they can crit, they can get zeal items making them more mobile, they have access to life steal, etc).\n\nThe R is something I'm still working on. I personally don't think it's over powered because it has a low base damage, low scaling, but is mainly about the utility it offers. When utilized right it can be game changing (Such as Cassiopeia's R), despite it not having the most impressive of damage. The thing about Selena is her kit is different in the sense it provides her with tools for skirmishing (like you'd find on similar champions like Camille & Irelia) and dealing sustained damage, most mages don't require that because they're about the burst they offer (or other form of team benefit like wave clear [Anivia, Malzahar], Siege [Ziggs], control [Taliyah].

Her ult is now up every 26 seconds, the rest of them are on about a 5-6 second CD max rank. Look to increase these accordingly. Mana problems are only existent until she has tear or lost chapter. Aftert hat point I don't feel there will be much problem. Melee champions will definately find it hard to play against her thanks to her shield, knockback, stun.

She&#x27;s essentially an ability power adc, but because she&#x27;s a mage she&#x27;s not given tools that adcs naturally have to handle their targets (their basic attacks naturally hurt because they build attack damage, they can crit, they can get zeal items making them more mobile, they have access to life steal, etc).\n> \n\nI agree she has little escape othert hen her CC inherent in her kit, however I also feel that with just a single item she'd be able to 100-0 someone, plus have plenty of sustained damage in a teamfight. I'd again suggest picking one and sticking with it. At his height of his damage last season, malz mains still have to get their opponents down to 60% before using his full ult combo AND a Q afterwards to have even a chance of securing a kill. If you want her to be a defbuff control mage then look towards this kind of damage. Her AP ADC style to descirbe I can see, but can also worry about. Add rageblade, Rylais, Liandries, Hurricane and nashors tooth and you have so much damage, with a shield etc to match. If you want her to be an adc then remove her W entirely, take away the AOE of her E (or at least the stun part), concentrate on her passive being that on hit magic damage effect.\n\n> The R is something I&#x27;m still working on. I personally don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s over powered because it has a low base damage, low scaling, but is mainly about the utility it offers. When utilized right it can be game changing (Such as Cassiopeia&#x27;s R), despite it not having the most impressive of damage. The thing about Selena is her kit is different in the sense it provides her with tools for skirmishing (like you&#x27;d find on similar champions like Camille &amp; Irelia) and dealing sustained damage, most mages don&#x27;t require that because they&#x27;re about the burst they offer (or other form of team benefit like wave clear [Anivia, Malzahar], Siege [Ziggs], control [Taliyah]. I&#x27;m eager to here your opinions on this though, as you&#x27;ve given insightful feedback.\n>\n\nThe R is very much in need of change, but here's a few other things I'd suggest.\n\nPassive: Pick something. One thing. Concentrate on that. I love the idea of her having an AA become magic damage after using a spell, I love her spells giving the enemy a debuff so she spells do more damage, I don't like adding onto that a buff to everything else. I think it is overkill. Also consider her \"phoenix\" link. Where's the \"Rise from the ashes\" part that is definitive of the phoenix. I'd see her passive being better as a brand style with each champion hit increasing magic damage by x%, stacking 3-5 times. At max stacks she has an anivia/aatrox style Resurrection.\n\nQ: Increase the CD, lower/remove the damage amp (she doesn't need it if you make her passive do a damage amp instead of the buffs to everything), consider increasing the AP ratios.\n\nW: Consider this with Rylias and Liandry's and 800AP. The maximum damage is now almost 1000 aoe. You either want them to be close or not. I'd remove the damage portion of this and leave the rest as is.\n\nE: An AOE knockback on a CD that low? Increase the CD so at 40% CDR it has a LEAST an 8 second cooldown. \n\nR: So yeah, this thing is broken. It's almost as spamable as lux ult, and could easily get there with the right runes/items. The slow almost guarantees a hit with the following 3 charges, and it's a good AOE burn that with Rylais and Liandry's is just...well broken.\nRemove the slow, take out the other 3 charges, keep the MR shred and look at rumble ult and balance the damage around that (remembering the effects of the passive and MR shred!). Rumble may be in a bad place right now, but his ULT is not the reason xD.\nAlternatively keep all but the slow, have the animation be slow to allow for dodging, and reduce the base damage by half. Remember at level 6 most champions who aren't rushing HP will have about 1k hp. This means hitting with all 4 charges would do 500 (200+100+100+100) base damage with a 65% AP ratio on each AND a MR shred on the final 3. If the aim is to debuff then don't go on the basis of the best debuff is death xD\n\nWhen it comes to her low AP ratio's, I'd think of this: Low AP ratios needs high base. This puts them squarely in early/midgame strength rather then mid/lategame. Giving her low ratios AND base damage will make her bad throughout. With her I'd like to see a balance of early game poke, with a strong mid to late game to take advantage of a lower CD and her kit scaling naturally well with items.\n\nThese are my thoughts. I like the idea of her as an APC botlaner, and as a mage mid. But at the moment she could fill either role, as well as go toplane like swain and vlad, or support like brand. I think you need to consider which one you want :)","replies":[{"poster":"Geneseid","date":"2018-06-12T09:43:00.849+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I took everything you said into consideration and changed mostly all of her abilities minus her passive.\n\nHer Q has been kept relatively the same except the cool down altered and the amp heavily reduced (but still increasing based on her passive as I want her to feel rewarded somehow for maintaining those stacks).\n\nThe W has had it's damage removed, but I added a new effect that I believe fits her thematically.

There's more in that one passive then most entire champion kits. Remember the more it gives, the more that needs balancing required. Aim for one thing and stick to it.\n\nQ looks much better. I still feel she will suffer late game with that low AP ratio, but with 20% additional damage on her other spells I guess it's ok.\n\nW looking much better. It didn't need the damage anyway and I think this will be much more healthy for her. Also consider putting teh mana cost to 70 at all ranks.\n\nE Now we're talking! Low early game damage with some utility, but scales well into late game. Also a reasonable CD. I'd have the mana cost scale to 90 and start the CD at 20 seconds. Also consider making it a cone. Far more useful against melee champions and it's range could then be lowered to 600. Also be careful with fast scaling base damages/lower cd as you level it. People will wonder what to level first and this ability gives so much each time you level it :P\n\nR Looking better. The damage will no longer be devistating early, and removing the slow will also make it more of a skill shot. Still think the cooldown needs to be higher, say 180/120/60.\n\nOn the whole I think it's far more balanced now. The passive really needs some work, but the rest is starting to take a nice shape. Her Q will give her a pretty good clear early, with her W and E giving her some nice protection. Late game her Q will do little but initiate for that starting damage, with her ult and then E doing the heavy lifting. Just need to work out what you want from that passive now xD","replies":[{"poster":"Geneseid","date":"2018-06-12T10:40:39.768+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Passive has simply lost the attack speed as I feel it was just an addition to the cake.

Remove this and you could keep both, but then I'd suggest reducing the passive to 1 aa instead of 2.\n\nAs for the rest, really like it.

And is she a character you&#x27;d actually enjoy playing (I&#x27;m asking all of this to see if putting extra work into alternating her even paid off).\n\nMuch better. I think she's still got options. She could go as an APC style like Kennen, on hit, or go as a standard mage. I'd say she still stands out well, the core of her kit is still there, but it is no longer overwhelming. Theres some nice combo options for her, and with her relatively low CD's and multiple charged ult, she will cause havoc in a team fight, while still having the chase potential you were looking for in lane. \nIf I was building her mid I'd definitely look towards an early tear into a rylais rush then onto either liandry's or Lichbane and then finish up my serephs. A lot on control mages will build liandry's this way to get the maximum damage out of their kit (2% burn is a LOT with low damage early) though I'd put priority on Rylais because of the slow working so well with her kit.. Lichbane is also a good option on her because of the \"spam\" opportunity of her spells and her high AA range (650 is a nice high range).\nMy runes would probably be elecrocute as it would be pretty easy to proc and give nice burst, cheap shot because of the ryali's rush, anything next and then ultimate hunter. Secondary I'd grab transcendence and either mana flow or gathering storm unless I needed resolve for more tankiness, though precision would also be a good one for presence of mind and legend alacrity (lower ult CD and faster AA would work well on her).\nPhase rush is also a good option for her if you'd want to look at sticking with sorcery.\n\nCombo wise I'd go for a Q into my first ult, then E for a stun and follow up with the other ult charges, using aa when and if I could at 4 stacks with lichbane. This would allow some serious damage to be thrown out quickly. Q is dodgeable but not on a long CD so if it missed I'd lose nothing. If it hits then rylais will slow them and I can follow up with my first ult shot,and using the E to stun next would guarantee I hit the rest of my ult shots. AA at 4 stacks is optimal, but of course with lichbane you can look to throw in an aa after Q, and then use Q again at the end.\n\nIn extended teamfights I can see her kit being truly devastating, but again it isn't really overtuned anymore as the combo would do far less in a 1v1 in lane then in a teamfight. Using her ult well will also allow any other AP champions in your team to do a lot more damage as it is essentially a voidstaff worth of MP in mid to late game for all. Imagine that combo'd with a AP Kennen ult... OUCH!\n\nI like it, I think it's balanced, unique, has counterplay and fits the role/s you wanted. Obviously it would take play-testing to tweek but I'd be happy with seeing this champion on the rift :) GJ","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Warlord Rhinark","date":"2018-06-11T13:50:00.831+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> Her powers are among the most impressive of any mage on Runetera\n\nMary Sue detected.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hèntaî ","date":"2018-06-11T03:59:36.985+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Rito, pls.
