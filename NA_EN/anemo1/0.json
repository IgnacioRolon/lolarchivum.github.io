Come to find out after searching a bit others have had this problem before, anyways since I was dc'd the match was remade and I was given 5 low priority queue times...ok whatever i'll watch some videos and sit it out. Once in champ select I was trying to ban when it came to me but it would not select the character, which ultimately kicked me out and gave me a 10 minute wait queue time on top of the 20 mins. ANnoyingly queued up again waiting out ANOTHER 20 minutes finally the afk check comes up and I click accept/ready, it grays out since I clicked it but kicks me out and says I was not ready and have now been given a 25 minute queue wait time....I have now wasted about an hour just to get into a simple game....No clue wtf is going on and would like some feedback/justification of why im getting afk wait queue times when I am present and accepting the match...I also have been having trouble when people leave the lobby and I get stuck in champ select when it clearly says everyone in the lobby has left, and that summoner 3 has failed to select a champion...but im still here, reluctantly I wait it out knowing if I close the client I have to wait ANOTHER 20 minutes, after waiting about 5 of just staring at the champ select I close it out and continue wait...I understand the whole queue wait times but like I said i've now waited an hour for a single match, for no reason apparently if the 500 ping wasn't my fault but I digress.","replies":[{"poster":"Anemo1","date":"2016-09-12T09:35:20.922+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just now happened again, my client crashed so I restarted, loaded into game, went well and won...get out of game and I have another 5 games of leaverbuster...wtf is this system","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-12T18:37:02.321+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your client is experiencing an *extremely unstable* connection to the server. When you disconnect from the server in champ select, it looks like a dodge, which will trigger a low-priority queue if a trend of these happens. Most of the time, an unstable connection is caused by local network settings that conflict with League. As a first step in resolving this, I recommend working through the steps in our [connection guide.](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues)\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}]}
