No need to tryhard in co-op, whether in the ordinary version or URF. The bots would launch a bunch of nonsense at you, but it was okay, because you could do the same thing. And the bots picked normally rather than going for optimal URF champs.\n\nAnd then Riot removed co-op from URF, and then they removed _choosing the damn champ you wanted to play_ from URF, and then they removed the parts of Ultra-Rapid Fire that were _too_ ultra-rapid fire (like heals) rather than boosting the things that were garbage in URF (like Yasuo and Karthus), and so on.\n\nThe excuse for removing URF is that it was literally too fun - so fun that people quit when it went away. I guess ripping fun out of the game is a great way to get people to stay so that your revenue won't go down by 21%, right Riot?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Cloud273","date":"2019-01-23T00:01:09.034+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"No matter what game mode you're playing, it's only a matter of time until a meta develops.
