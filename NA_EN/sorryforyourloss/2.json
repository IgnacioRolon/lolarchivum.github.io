Does typing out a reason even help? I&#039;ve reported people who openly used racial slurs and homophobic slurs in all chat just to get no notification of disciplinary action. I have tried to report people who intentionally feed, (Its not as hard to prove as you make it out to be.) 0/14/2 is not a &quot;bad game.&quot;\r\n\r\nThere used to be a tribunal where actual people reviewed reports, boy that was nice. For a dev to talk so much about how they hate unsportsmanlike conduct, you sure do very little to prevent unsportsmanlike conduct. And you really don&#039;t give us any insight or impact on the matter. Bring back the tribunal, let the COMMUNITY decide what is bannable. NOT some algorithm.","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-06-08T13:50:25.384+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well there's many threads everyday about people complaining about how they didn't deserve their ban, so i say they do.","replies":[{"poster":"SorryForYourLoss","date":"2017-06-08T13:54:59.809+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"many threads?

Thousands.\n\nConcerning your topic, you rarely get a notification when someone you report is punished. It does not always send one out for punishments and when it does it only sends it to the last person that reported them before they got punished. So like, if you reported someone in a game, and someone else from that game reported them after and they get punished you won't get a notification.\n\nAlso, it is pretty rare that I see someone flaming nowadays. Maybe there is something you are doing that is helping to create a toxic environment? I would suggest at the first sight of toxicity muting the offender without saying anything about it.\n\nAs for the intentional feeding remark, you had a game 19 days ago where you went 0/12/3, so where is the line drawn?\n\nAs for the old Tribunal, there were very few players actually reviewing cases back then. Most people just waited until they were allowed to vote and then clicked \"punish\" so that they could get easy IP. There were also very few people reviewing in comparison to the amount of cases, which meant it could take a very long time for players who broke the rules to be punished meaning that it would be difficult for them to see what behavior got them punished.\n\nThe community still helps decide what is punishable. I believe the way it works is that Riot reads the comments and overall chatlogs reported to see what players deem reportable and, if it is prevalent enough they change the system to look for it. That is probably a gross oversimplification though, and I don't have a source.","replies":[{"poster":"SorryForYourLoss","date":"2017-06-09T01:30:04.756+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"close, but you blew your entire argument in the first sentence. There aren't 15 in a day, go check. there are 15 over the course of about 5 days. more like 3 a day, 900 in a year. A far cry from the THOUSANDS who are toxic daily lol. Riot doesn't \"read chat logs\"\n\nHere's how the system works, a program checks for buzz words. Homophobic slurs, racial slurs, etcc. When someone is reported, it takes a tally. So many tallies within a set time frame(Example: 3 reports in 3 days) results in a flag. That flag is then examined by a rioter. Then, the discipline is issued. (The first ban usually a chat restriction is fully automated.)\n\nSure there is a behavior subforum, but if you attempt to reach out there, they will remove your post and tell you \"submit a ticket.\"\n\nUhm, are you fucking kidding riot? In order to ensure my report meets a HUMAN I have to completely stop what I'm doing, get on the league site, and open a ticket, then wait days for someone to reply back \"We looked into it and thank you for your feedback.\"\n\nThe system is screwed.\n\nAs for your little comment about my KDA that game, do some extra research bud. My account wasn't even level 30, and there were two gold players on the enemy team. Not to mention the top laner did a whopping 4,669 damage and managed to get **ONE** cs in the last 11 minutes of the game. That game was a 4v5. Please, try harder to find me intentionally feeding.\n\nAnyone toxic in my games gets muted after I type something like \"Fight them not eachother.\" I generally am the more chill one in my games and tend to play the babysitter. I'm touched you look all the way to 19 days back on my OP.GG though. I'm glad you had to look THAT far to find a game even remotely close to inting even though your facts weren't straight.","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-06-09T02:12:49.032+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That game was like, maybe 3 minutes of research, and I don't care what the odds were, you said in your topic that bad scores = feeding. You are the one that said it is not gard to prove someone was intentionally feeding and could determine that based on score, so you just defeated your own argument.\n\nI didn't check thouroughly on how many posts a day, scrolled until I found enough (can't remember how many but it was like 12 or so) and the post I stopped on was 21 hours ago. If I checked inside the posts individually there were probably more.\n\nI have never heard of Riot deleting posts on the forums because they  are asking about your own punishments, assuming you did not break any of the board's rules and they were on the correct board. In fact there are several which we were just talking about.\n\nYes, you have to make a ticket and wait when you request a review of your account. There is nothing wrong with that, that is so that they can provide good customer service.","replies":[{"poster":"SorryForYourLoss","date":"2017-06-09T12:29:43.139+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have tried to report people who intentionally feed, (Its not as hard to prove as you make it out to be.) 0/14/2 is not a \"bad game.\"\n\nThose were my exact words. I didn't say bad score = inting. Also, notice the context. Maybe re-read the first sentence of the post there buddy. And as for the last two sections of your reply, I was not saying posts about your own account being suspended, I was talking about posts regarding OTHER players behavior. Hense the statement \"TO ENSURE MY REPORT MEETS A HUMAN.\"\n\nYou can try to debate me all day by trying to pick apart my grammar, (which is correct by the way.) Or you can acknowledge that I am correct and RIOT doesn't do much in the way of community regulation. Maybe you should go play a game or two in bronze to remind yourself of how many toxic people there are who just never seem to get reprisal.\n\nThe part about bad score isn't just a bad game, doesn't mean bad games = bans. It means bad games mean something needs to be looked at closer. Like my game for instance. You merely looked at 3 numbers. Thank GOD you're not handing out bans. You do zero digging. Literally clicking one arrow shows exactly what happened that game. If riot could bring back the tribunal, people could take 3 minutes to investigate these claims for a bit of IP, or hell. I'D do it for free, just to help clean up the community. After all, RIOT does provide us a free to play game. The least we could do is actually help out some.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2017-06-08T14:15:08.300+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"2% of the reigonal players are on the boards, 20% of them are vocal, and majority of them don't visit PB&M.

A chat restriction or 14 day, maybe not. And it depends on how much they value that account. Like going to court, is it worth fighting to reduce the sentence even if you commited the crime? I think the choice to come here and complain is personal and case by case, but the fact stands, riot doesn't police the game they way they would like us to believe. People do toxic crap all the time and because its simply not in chat, riot doesn't see it even if it's reported. \nFor example, you are fighting an enemy and your jungler is RIGHT there, full health, full mana, just around the corner. He stops and watches, maybe even does a /dance after watching you die, all because you couldn't save him earlier in a fight. So he just watches you die, over and over. Essentially throwing the game out of spite. Good luck reporting that guy.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"PandaPenyihir","date":"2017-06-08T23:21:08.834+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"finally learning riot doesnt give a fuck about the community? well done","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hawckey","date":"2017-06-08T22:30:47.655+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"gotta wait 10 years for these sloths at dorito HQ to finally catch up with what other games are doing. they have 1 computer at their HQ and it's powered by a hamster so they will probably take at least a few more years for them to realise that removing tribunal for a dog shit y = mx + b algorithm that only bans people for the most extremes of cases was a bad idea.
