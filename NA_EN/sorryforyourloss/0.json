I'm not trying to waste 30-45 minutes of my time on a loss because you want to troll and int every lane while bragging about it in chat.\n\n\"Its just norms\" is the most tilting statement anyone has made in my presence on league. That, and \"I dont care.\"\n\nSorry, if this was call of duty and i could get into a new match in 7 more minutes, whatever, feed your happy ass off. But this is league.

Just like when you're playing an ARAM or any other game mode and people will say \"It's just ARAM\" or \"It's just Poro King\". People who scorn or belittle others for wanting to do their best to win have some of the most negative mentalities in League of Legends. It's like they don't understand that their own definition of fun isn't the only one that exists. Some people consider doing their best in a game regardless of winning or losing to be fun, and that's perfectly fine. Others are more competitive and have more fun in victory than in defeat, which is also fine. But somehow, the latter are made fun of for being \"tryhards\" while the trolls who pick top Bard or support Gangplank in Normals get a free pass more often than not because \"it's just a normal\". Seems fair to me.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bardo Bard Bard","date":"2017-06-08T13:47:47.279+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since exactly 7 years I just play normals. Okay, there was no ranked back then yet, but I often hear \"dun crie, itz normalz\".\n\nFunny thing is, since it's actually a normal game, not a private bot game, of course the rules apply there as well - and thus reports and bans.\nJust yesterday (!) I had a Rammus in a 3-premade that was a total asshole and proud of, he and his 2 premades ruined my game on my alternate account and they were like \"It'z normalz, nuthing happenz\" and simply reported all 3 for all 3 reasons (giving up, feeding, verbal bause) and it took only one game that I have been greeted with a \"punished player\" popup before I even got into the endgame tally screen. So, listen you fucks: \"Da normalz\" giving you \"regular banz\" that will fuck up your whole account including your \"gret ranked skillz\".\n\n-- {{champion:432}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gunpowder Green","date":"2017-06-07T02:14:42.926+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe go normal draft next time?","replies":[{"poster":"SorryForYourLoss","date":"2017-06-07T13:53:27.268+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh that totally fixes the problem. no one ever target bans their own team, troll picks, or does anything kappa in draft >.>","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-06-07T01:20:53.024+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a player of bot annie and support garen, i agree that \"its just norms\" is the worst and most annoying excuse for someone being bloody bad.\n\nIf one must fuck around with idiotic picks in norms, at least do it right and make an effort.","replies":[{"poster":"SorryForYourLoss","date":"2017-06-07T01:29:30.294+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"right?
