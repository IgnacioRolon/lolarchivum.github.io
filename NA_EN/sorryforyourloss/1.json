You&#039;re joking right? I spend 20$ on a skin and you want me to spend 10 more just to get missions?\r\n\r\n2. You messed up the dates on the FAQ and in client to say we only have so much time to earn tokens. So I spent mine thinking I wouldn&#039;t get anymore.\r\n\r\n3. You gave us ONE update the entire event about who was winning the Chaos vs Order fight.\r\n\r\n4. The story was more of a bunch of back and white pictures that told us less about what was actually happening and didn&#039;t hardly tell a story at all to be honest. Yasuo and Riven are fighting. Dope. What started it? What stands to happen if Chaos wins? What stands to happen if Order wins? Unrelenting chaos or unbreakable harmony sounds less like an outcome and more like a white house explanation of foreign affairs.\r\n\r\n5. PAY FOR MISSIONS? WHAT?\r\n\r\n6. The whole event was a bit fuzzy. The dates were confusing, we have this long to earn tokens, we have this long to spend them, this is how you get the border, these other icons and emote mean literally nothing, etcc.\r\n-------------------\r\nRiot, thank you for any measure of free things, including this game as a whole. I did enjoy the event and convincing my friends who hate yasuo to side with him for me. I did like looking at the comic so props to the artist. The skins both look great, the dialog between them when they fight is awesome. I just wish there weren&#039;t so many trap doors that required me to spend more money to get something like the border when I bought the skin on the second day. It&#039;s like with the release of hextech cores and project skins. You damn well had to buy them to get the first strike borders, when originally first strike was something you got for buying the skin earlier than everyone else, or maybe buying a bundle. I&#039;d have rather still gotten the border for first strike on Yasuo than an emote that lasts a couple weeks. Or another icon that really doesn&#039;t mean much.\r\n_note to self: Self, don&#039;t ever spend anything riot gives you until the last day you can spend it._","replies":[{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-06-27T17:51:36.596+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Fed Zed Bot,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=jqEvIlPQ,comment-id=,timestamp=2017-06-27T17:34:37.206+0000)\n>\n> 3.

Also, it is HIGHLY unlikely its updated hourly as pretty much nothing in league updates hourly.
