The trail to show the passive seed being set was green (base) and then became the haunted Zyra color when I posted it. I don't know but in any case thanks because you know my love for Zyra ❤️","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vekkna","date":"2016-10-04T21:31:25.946+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Speaking of Zyra and skins, this month will be 3 years since Zyra had a skin in the rotation. I believe that is actually the longest any non-rework champ has ever gone without a skin (edit: Looks like it's been 3 weeks longer for Viktor). What's up with that?\n\n(p.s. was holding out hope for a Pumpkin Patch Zyra for Halloween Q___Q)","replies":[]}]}]}
