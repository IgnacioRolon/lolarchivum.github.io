The buff holder has empowered attacks it has killed a unit in the past 3 sec. (9 sec cooldown) The empowered attack fears the target for 1 sec and minions/monsters flee for 2 seconds around the target if it was a champion. \r\n\r\nContext: the 5% reduction and static shiv mechanic currently on herald is making it in appealing. Instead having a mini vilemaw buff exclusive to the holder with a cooldown would give more satisfaction and wouldn&#039;t overtune it.\r\n\r\n2) remove old buff, replace with the &quot;Head of the Void&quot; (similar to Khazix and Rengar). Lasts for remainder of the game. The holder and his allies (within 1000 units) take 15% reduced damage from Baron Nashor and has a 2% max hp/sec aura damage to Baron Nashor while engaging Baron Nashor. \r\n\r\nContext: having herald impact later game via barons etc would make it more appealing from the get-go. Maybe instead of a %hp/sec damage, Baron could have reduced attacks or have more basic attacks before special attacks?? Idk.\r\n\r\nAlso I think herald should &quot;age&quot; like humans. Have it do ok damage early (~6-8 min), more damage at (~9-15 min) and then slowly reduce damage until death at 19:55. Just an idea of where to shift action during the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2017-01-19T01:43:34.898+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Rift Herald as a pre-cursor to an early Baron's an idea we've been kicking around actually. Super speculative, but having it give you early baron pressure, in exchange for telegraphing your intent to the enemy team, might have some value. Wouldn't be too relevant in a lot of games (early baron too risky), but might perhaps give teams who are really ahead a way to close out games that are effectively over already quicker.","replies":[{"poster":"MunchCrunchLunch","date":"2017-01-19T03:52:27.290+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=grG2y998,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2017-01-19T01:43:34.898+0000)\n>\n> Rift Herald as a pre-cursor to an early Baron&#x27;s an idea we&#x27;ve been kicking around actually.

Also whatever thing you do with herald (minus the removal) could we have an animation for Baron killing the herald? I think that would be a nice addition when he's about to expire","replies":[]},{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2017-01-19T04:47:53.837+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It feels like Rift Herald's current plague is \"won't be too relevant in a lot of games\". Currently taking it depends on your Top Laner being able to put it to good use, as well as your Top and Jungler being able to get to the pit and attack the Rift Herald without being disturbed. More than 2 players attacking it feels next to useless, since the majority of the damage dealt to it is by attacking its weak spot.\n\nI think it might be better if the question \"do we take the Rift Herald?\" became \"*when* do we take the Rift Herald?\" or \"*how* do we take the Rift Herald?\". Part of that maybe making the power more visible, part of that may be making it harder to stop with just one enemy showing up at the pit. \n\nHaving something like Camille's adaptive shield for Rift Herald could encourage different players to get involved with taking it, needing a source of magic and physical damage to be most effective. That could create scenarios where an AD Top + AD Jungler would benefit from ganking for their AP Mid to free them up to help take it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"5000000000000000","date":"2017-01-19T04:30:35.569+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That seems like an interesting decision.

Way too strong for anyone who's skillshot reliant or needs to be outplayed, and also way too hard to manage since it procs on minions.","replies":[]}]}
