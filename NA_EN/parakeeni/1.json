I lost my first game and didn't get a free win. I'm loading into my game and my client crashes and it gives me an update that none of my friends had to do. Then i was loading into the game at 100% and the team did a remake. I got punished for something I didn't do. I'm back to 63 LP and super pissed.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-18T22:01:33.456+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I looked into this for you, and it does seem that you weren't able to rejoin the game, which resulted in a remake.  Your next series should enable promo helper, but it's important to fix up whatever is causing you to not connect properly.  If something like this happens again, your promo helper could be disabled!  Let me know if you'd like any help in getting that resolved!","replies":[]}]}
