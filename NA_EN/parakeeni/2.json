It removed it but again when the patch got to 33% it stopped going up. Now the files  scanned is still increasing to a highly unreasonable number. What should I do?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-21T18:32:31.919+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let it do its thing.  It needs to scan files and repair any corrupt files.  Depending on your computer, this may take some time.  Unless you receive any errors, it will keep scanning until it's done.  If you stop the process it will have to start all over again.  Since the connection guide didn't resolve this, please reach out to our tech team to help out by [submitting a ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).","replies":[{"poster":"Parakeeni","date":"2016-07-21T18:37:12.737+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok i'll give it an hour. Then if It doesn't improve ill submit a ticket. His computer is fairly old too, it's an HP Pavilion that we got maybe 5 years ago? It doesn't run things very well but we have never had a problem with updating LOL on it before. Thanks for the advice though","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
