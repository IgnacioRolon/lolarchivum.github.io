Or interact with all champions on the roster to name something odd\n\nWe already need to get S games to get 7 so that proves a certain mastery is needed before you can attempt mastery 8\n\nSo mastery 8 could be something entirely different then just getting S+ ratings which could then be used for mastery 9.\n\nAnd mastery 10 could be some sort of series of ridiculous challenges based on the champion itself like acquiring 10k health on Sion in a soloq game & killing 10 people with your passive etc etc, something iconic and unique for each champion","replies":[]},{"poster":"Teemodanegro","date":"2017-02-04T21:03:42.119+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"How about something actually having to do with being good at the champion?","replies":[{"poster":"WinTheWarOnPants","date":"2017-02-04T21:10:47.870+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"afk farming doesn't reflect champion mastery? {{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}}","replies":[{"poster":"Spice POWAH","date":"2017-02-05T00:26:51.442+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Of course not!
