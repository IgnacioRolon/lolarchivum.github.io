Patcher doesn't work can't click it anywhere and I haven't been able to play at all in months. It is quite aggravating since I do like to play even if I am a horrid player.\n\nIf anyone knows what's going on please let me know this is beyond angering.\n\nI have looked around the internet for fixes, I've uninstalled and reinstalled I've completely manually removed league and deleting all folders, factory reset my computer, everything that I can think of.\n\nI have even done everything that is mentioned here. I do not even know what to do anymore. http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/RW1cIzkE-solution-for-the-black-screen-glitch-on-pvpnet-launcher\n\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-17T21:22:57.650+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you using the Legacy Client or the Beta Client?","replies":[]}]}
