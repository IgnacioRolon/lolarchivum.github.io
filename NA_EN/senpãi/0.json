Basically what happens is I click on the \"Continue\" button when the game is over, then my screen turns black and a white window on the upper left hand of my screen keeps flashing for about 5 seconds, then I hear a sound that plays when something is disconnected, then my computer freezes. I tried every command in the book but nothing un-freezes it. I downloaded Hextech Repair Tool and re-installed the newest patch released, then I restarted my computer and started up another game to see if it fixed the problem. (Spoiler Alert: It didn't) So I basically have just given up playing until I fix this because I don't want to keep hard-resetting my computer just to play another game. Hope some of you can help.\r\n\r\nMy PC Specs (Things I think are important)\r\n\r\nOS Name\tMicrosoft Windows 10 Home\r\nVersion\t10.0.10586 Build 10586\r\nSystem Type\tx64-based PC\r\nProcessor\tIntel(R) Core(TM) i7-4770K CPU @ 3.50GHz, 3501 Mhz, 4 Core(s), 8 Logical Processor(s)","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-21T18:13:22.033+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm seeing an increasing number of players on Windows 10 seeing issues with system freezes and game crashes.

I didn't do the others because I wan't to have sound while I play, my computer isn't overheating, and I wan't very good in-game quality. But it worked for 1 game so far.

As far as I can tell, windows 10 doesn't like you telling your computer what to do.","replies":[]}]}
