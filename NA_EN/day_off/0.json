With his sustain, he can easily jungle, go against tanks/bruisers, assassins and mages, and sometimes I can see him supporting and doing just fine.\n\nThe roles are more important than the lanes. Picking a Riven top with a Shaco jungle isn't always the best idea, for instance, even if that's where they are \"meta.\" \n\nMid lane, from my experience, tends to be the snowball lane and holds champions who scale the best with levels (assassins to hit 6 and other power spikes to, well, assassinate. They don't do as well in other roles because their power spikes are delayed. Mages for base damages as well). Utility mages, however, are popular in mid as well as support, and a few go solo top since they aren't as reliant on levels and they have enough utility and damage to solo lane as well as teamfight. Lulu used to be like this and can be still with team comps such as Juggermaw, and other champions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"warpenguin555","date":"2015-04-24T15:38:09.458+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Urgot","replies":[]},{"poster":"AMYS GRAVE","date":"2015-04-24T15:37:24.654+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:117}} {{champion:85}} {{champion:10}} {{champion:41}} work in all 5 roles.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RÃ¯ven","date":"2015-04-23T08:11:07.024+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:150}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Spiritflare868","date":"2015-01-19T09:19:10.402+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thresh can be played any role.
