So is Nunu&#039;s both super weird and long duration &quot;slow motion&quot; knockup not a problem against both statements you had made before, Riot?\n\nHell, why can&#039;t the rolling snowball&#039;s CC be a stun? Because the &quot;slow-motion&quot; displacement just looks and plays like all kinds of wonkiness. Like why would you think slow motion knockup that locks the target in the air for ages and they sitting there feeling like the game is bugged, is such a great idea to begin with? I mean, what&#039;s the point of Tenacity when it would appear most of the game&#039;s currently CCs aren&#039;t even affected by Tenacity due to the clear over-presence of displacements?\n\nDo you really have to try THIS hard, to the point of blatantly going against your previous statements and making the effect look astonishingly awkward, and having this on a basic ability even, just so you can continue your spree of using increasingly contrived reason to not have CCs be interact-able with Tenacity?\n\nMight as well just remove Tenacity altogether, at least we won&#039;t have to deal with BS like long and slow-mo knockup. Ofc, I'm being sarcastic. I want Tenacity to stay, I also want it to actually matter, and I want Riot to stop fondling with displacements due to some undisclosed stigma that believe CC shouldn't be countered.\n\n.......\n\nDisclaimer, I am NOT saying Nunu rework is OP or anything, not yet anyway. \n\n**But the knockup on W is all sorts of wrong.

I would rather give him back his unstoppable on W and reduce its dmg, since he's meant to be a tank that soaks up damage and be hit by skills, so you can give him some skill expression and less stupid damage.\n\nI was talking about rakan in the other two points, sorry if it wasn't clear. I meant it's ok for Rakan's W to be this small Knockup unaffected by tenacity because of it was a small charm enemies with tenacity would immediately retaliate on his successful engage.

Its all well and good to act like buffing tenacity will make the game better, but you&#x27;re not even considering the huge metashift that will come with it.\n\nYou think the game is not at the meta where people blow up each other in 1 second or lose the fight, that tanks are very super relevant today, and no one can CC lock someone down to their death just because, that mobility and escapes aren't going overboard and making players to slippery, and Tenacity is actually on the items everywhere and easily accessible? Holy shit, I must be playing some hack version of this game, where can I go and download the real League of Legends?\n\nBut really, seriously. I'd thought counters are supposed to be, you know, actual counters? What's so wrong with having a counter to CC (especially in the time of CC bloating)? Or is there things that are never supposed to be countered, and you wonder why the game's balance is such a stupid mess.\n\nHell, you'd also think making all CCs uninteractive by making most of them displacements that can't be interacted with (and now, extendable displacements because fuck you) was the sole reason to the game's CC bloating, but apparently not accoding to Mr/Ms Jbels who is also implying that actually dealing with CC creeping with Tenacity will bring about the apocalypse where everyone stack Tenacity, like all 4 of those items (one of them is a potion, too), that are actually quite bad, and loses out a ton of other opportunity cost just like everything, and almost feels like building items is actually like a choice of the player and situational to the match to some extent once again.\n\nI mean, really. Just go back to the armour and HP analogy, with every mention of Tenacity to HP and armour, and the secondary subject into physical damage. What you're doing is saying that armour and HP are such a bad idea because all physical damage dealers would do no damage and everyone would be stacking armour and HP. \"Oh really?\" I ask. Yeah last time it happened was when HP and whatnot had no counters like way back in the S2 or something, so remind me why having no counter to CC (I'm referring to displacement CC) is actually a good idea again?\n\nLet us be real, Tenacity is not going to destroy League, it has NEVER done so even in the days of \"meta-golem\" in S2, which was broken but NOT in the sense of Tenacity (again, it was when tankiness had no direct counters. So this shows that having no counter IS bad, and NOT the notion of having it). Stop dreading the impossible and actually face the real and current issue of CC creeping that is actually in the game right now that needs something like \"universal Tenacity\" to finally address.\n\nThis is even more true when Riot is even introducing utter nonsense like \"long displacement\" into the mix like it's nothing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hemulen Magi","date":"2018-08-29T11:48:51.757+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Having tenacity affect knockups will not on its own make tenacity a must-have on carries.  What it will do is prevent tenacity from being phased out as a reliably useful stat for anyone as more and more knockups are introduced and standard CC is shortened and removed.  \n\nAlso, hypothetically, even in a meta where carries can't be perma-cc'ed or instantly bursted, tanks won't become worthless unless if carries' damage isn't nerfed and they continue to output so much damage that they shred the tanks within 1-4 seconds while not needing their protection in short fights where everyone is obliterated.  In a meta where carries can survive several seconds non-cc-locked in a teamfight without pumping out enough damage to ace the enemy team, even higher survivability tanks can still make an impact by disrupting a fight enough to turn the tides of battle, possibly putting out multiple rotations of CC abilities in doing so.
