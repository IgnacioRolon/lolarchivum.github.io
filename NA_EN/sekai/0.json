No one was playing TT, and no one was posting or speaking or making suggestions about TT (at most we take shots at its 99% bot infested state since no one was playing it); TT was completely forgotten and ignored by the VAST majority of the playerbase who treat as if it'd never existed in the first place. For years no one gave the slightest of care when it was still a thing, so naturally thinking no one would mourn it when it leaves, right?\n\nWRONG! Because oh noes, Riot is going to remove the mode we've done everything we could to pretend it never existed for years, and what better chance to have a bitch about it?\n\nIt's like when Urgot was reworked where everyone is suddenly an upset Urgot main, when Galio was reworked everyone is suddenly an upset Galio main, and the story goes on.\n\nThis is not to defend Riot's often questionable decisions, but so I am equally appalled by the community for their often chronic need to find excuses go on an outrage.\n\n..........\n..........\n..........\n..........\n\nDownvote me for pointing out the reality. I don't care.","replies":[]}
