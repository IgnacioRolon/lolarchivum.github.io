However I don't feel you managed to hit the mark yet - and I'd like to tell you why.\n\nBear in mind, I'm only going by what we know so far about her kit (the ability preview on the Mid Season page) and the way it's being presented. **The biggest issue I'm having is with the way her new Miasma works.** Sure, at first its sheer size may seem impressive but **it comes with a harsh penalty - its fixed cast range.**\n\nAccording to the ability preview, you're unable of casting it close or right in front of Cass **which will make any attempt at combining it with your ultimate basically pointless** since the affected target will be still way out of your range. And how come you didn't buff her ult yet? **Instead you NERFED her R** - it's nothing else but a pitiful slow (**40%, it used to be 60%**) on a huge cooldown (120sec) at this point.\n\n**Her new Miasma will be still ineffective at stopping ganks or any other attack from the brink of your eye** since your enemies will be BELOW the cast-range of your W once that happens. In the end you're even less mobile than before since you won't be able to stop anyone who's about to get into your face. This new Miasma doesn't seem to work with her kit very well since it only prevents targets from fleeing at best (**and what's stopping them from simply flashing or jumping OVER it?**) as long as you can't influence its range at all. It has far too many handicaps and too little utility when it comes to her own survival.\n\nAnother aspect that still leaves me wondering has to be her manacosts which I wasn't able to deduce from the preview but apparently her E is a lot cheaper now compared to her Q, yet the poison-damage is still rather low compared to the output you receive from spamming your E. **How exactly is this a change from her current E-focused gameplay?** Her poisons are still too weak to justify maxing Q first, especially if you're depending on your E to properly lasthit.\n\n**In the end you weren't able to address her most glaring issues, those being her sloppy and unreliable ultimate along with her lack of mobility and escape tools.** You may have given her a slow with an impressive type of cc but it's still far too limited gameplaywise and doesn't synergize too well with the rest of her kit. **It's far too offensive in its use and offers too little defense for herself.** You seriously need to consider changing its size in favor of a more flexible cast range. You also need to address the power on her Q if you really care about her poison-mage identity.\n\nI really hope you listen to some of this feedback, I'd hate to see this rework end up as a disappointment like the one before.","replies":[{"poster":"HowPlayGAEM","date":"2016-04-19T19:49:54.830+0000","up_votes":28,"down_votes":3,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"MrBuffington","date":"2016-04-20T00:32:12.634+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean, Aurelion Sol sort of has a fixed distance with his passive and W (two different distances, but fixed at each location).\n\nThe fixed range seems to fit neatly with her ult AoE, so if players dash towards Cass over her W, she can always react with her ult for a good stun, since they'll be facing her. It doesn't really stop enemies from running away, but that wasn't a strength she ever had, so I don't think it's that big a deal.\n\nI think we have to see it in action more to really get a feel for it. On one hand, I think it should stop on enemy champions hit (it already stops on terrain), so she has a defensive option, not to mention the synergy with her ult is sort of niche. On the other hand, I think having it thrown over champions can let her trap enemies, and does have better ult synergy.","replies":[{"poster":"kDrakari","date":"2016-04-20T20:05:23.885+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"From using it on PBE her other abilities all have very similar range to each other, while Miasma's area is just beyond that so there's no overlap. The problem with that is, Miasma doesn't really do anything to keep enemies in that range, or protect her from things already within that area. Champions can still use mobility to go through the area, and the slow isn't strong enough to keep them from just walking through without problems and the debuff doesn't last long enough that it would hinder them once they leave.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Leu07","date":"2016-04-19T19:48:52.518+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah, if her W is fixed Ranged Then I suppose it is kind of shitty, it would be nice if they could allow her to cast it in shorter ranges and nearer you cast it, the less wide it is but it gets rounder (like current one), also, I am kind of worried about her dps now, is it going to be overall less damage coming from her?

Cassiopeia has 328 movespeed, gaining +4 movespeed per level. (So, technically, 332 base movement speed.)\n\nHer Q base damage was increased to 75/120/165/210/255 + 70% AP. But that damage is now divided into **7** ticks rather than 3. Idk why, it's not necessary. Just make it 3 tics or 4 if you want it to synergize with the cooldown and this ability will be good. The mana cost was increased from 40-80 to 60-80, and the ability pops a lot quicker, like maybe 2/3's the time of old Cassi Q. Idk why Riot did either of those last two changes.\n\nCassiopeia's new W is extremely weird. It behaves much more like like Morgana's puddle than other poison spells. The ability comes out fast, and reaches pretty far beyond Cassiopeia, and covers a lot of ground. But, it only lasts for 4 seconds, and as soon as the ability disappears, the damage stops- it doesn't linger for a little bit like on live. It also has a 70 mana cost at all ranks and a 20 second cooldown at all ranks, and has a really weird collision with terrain, bunching up the spell in one area.\n\nCassiopeia's E got tweaked heavily. It no longer resets on kill but has a base cooldown of .9 seconds, (Presumably, I took the CDR mastery and got .95 seconds) It refunds mana if you kill a unit with it, but no longer adds additional mana so you can't slowly recooperate your mana anymore. The base damage of Cassiopeia's new is very low and scales with level, and only has a .10% AP Ratio. You'll be doing around ~25 damage more than your attacks throughout the game. If the target is poisoned, the ability gains like 130-140 base damage at max rank and the ap ratio of 35%, for a total of 45% AP Ratio hitting poisoned targets. The base damage is like a little more than 200 hitting poisoned targets. And the spell also heals Cassiopeia for around ~25 + 10% AP damage if she's hitting a target who's poisoned.\n\nThe changes to Cassi's E was weird. The mana sustain and healing are pretty good to have from the get go, but the cooldown increase... you'll really notice your spam rate of the spell go down... Maybe if you get a lot of CDR it won't be so bad, but Cassiopeia doesn't have a lot of room in her build for a Morellos, nor will she probably get Abyssal's or Zhonyas or any items given CDR that didn't have it before until later on in the game. Cassiopeia's dueling potential has taken a hit for sure.\n\nCassiopeia's R is identical to live: 150/250/350 + 50% AP, with the nerf to the slow if targets are facing away. 40% down from 60%\n\n**Specific Notes**\nCassiopeia's play style feels a lot different now. Feels like you want to hit your Q, hit an E, footsie, hit an E, footsie, rather than just Q-EEEEEE. You'll want to be kiting around a lot more; this Cassiopeia feels a lot like Ahri in some ways with their huge emphasis on kiting.\n\nCassiopeia's kill combo potential was hit hard. Even with the original and 1st reworked Cassiopeia, you could stun someone with ult, and burst them down from full health by the time the ult wore off. I don't think that's the case with this new Cassiopeia; if you hit the stun, your W will fly far behind your target, leaving you only your Q and E. And E's no longer very spammable and the Q ticks way to many times. You'll probably get your target to half health.\n\nOn the whole, it seems this Cassiopeia has a huge emphasis on harass rather than all-inning. Use increased speed to hit a Q, maybe 2 E's, back off. Throw a W if someone tries to get too close. When their low, try to bait an engage, stun with ult, and then finish them off.\n\nWell, that's it. Everyone can form their own conclusion from this data!\n\n{{champion:69}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"exe3","date":"2016-04-20T01:04:13.071+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm very much on the fence about these changes.
