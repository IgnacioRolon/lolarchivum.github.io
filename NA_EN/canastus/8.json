It might not match her identity, but it still is fairly healthy gameplay.\n\nWHAT?!\n\nCalling Cass's ult AoE hard cc is very misleading since anyone actually awake can turn around during the animation and turn it into a mediocre slow.\n\nMiasma is a rubbish zoning tool. The damage is completely pathetic, the slow is fairly weak, it takes FOREVER to get up to a decent size and at that point it isn't around for much longer. Kog'maw produces a larger, more relevantly shaped slow field instantly, it deals its damage instantly and deals more than you could ever expect to deal with miasma, and it has a longer range than miasma.\n\nVayne has a solid source of self peel that she has pre-6, it becomes hard cc way more reliably than Petrifying gaze, and its fail-state is still way more useful.\n\nRyze likewise has a low-cooldown piece of cc that is hugely useful for him, plus he can stand to get a build that lets him take a hit or two without going down.\n\nCass's kit is GARBAGE for team fighting. Period. 1v1 late game is all she has but 1v1 doesn't win in the late game. If she Q's a target and it backs up behind a bruiser, she just has to sit and wait for Q to come up again because that bruiser is going to zone her out. If she misfires an E on the wrong target by reflex or due to mobility, then she has to sit and wait for Q and E to come up again. If she misses a Q due to mobility or a bad prediction, she has to sit and wait for Q to come up again AND she loses her movespeed buff.\n\nEvery time Cass has been decent since her rework were because the numbers had shifted such that she was strong in the early game like she used to be, because her kit works at bullying, 1v1'ing, and kiting, and is garbage at team fighting. What it's good at can let her get ahead and snowball in the early and mid, if the game comes down to 5v5 fights then she can do her best to get in some pot shots but is overall gimped.","replies":[{"poster":"iamleburk","date":"2016-01-12T04:44:09.187+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Lol you are getting really worked up about something really stupid.

Like, not even close to a legitimate thing. A late game cassio with peel is one of the most threatening things in the game, she can melt an entire team. Q has a low ass CD so it's not exactly much of a punishment to miss\n\nAnd no, she has been used at IEM for her late game potential and her teamfight potential.

Even if they dodge it, they've been forced to move somewhere and you can funnel them into a worse position.\n\ncass requires you to click anywhere on the 50% of the screen away from her during a very long and obvious animation marked by a very loud noise. There are very few skills in the game that lock the direction the champ faces and all you can really hope for is to catch the enemy in a dash animation which is much more about luck than skill.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Slamurai Jack","date":"2016-01-10T20:08:30.957+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Canastus,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=e7yzgea0,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2016-01-10T15:47:41.511+0000)\n>\n> I just see no point in playing a champion with a powercurve set between a 39% and 50% winrate from early to late \n\nI agree. \n\nhttp://imgur.com/2e6vLhR\n\nAlthough, oddly, I don't see any buff Yasuo threads anywhere.","replies":[{"poster":"KaisadiIIa","date":"2016-01-10T23:23:53.638+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"You make Jesus cry with your statistically-backed posts and your lack of meaningless, irrational hate.\n\nWhat's next?
