There are several reasons why both I and many others (not even Cass players) prefer her older form. \n\nFirst: Old Cass could be played several different ways. Her poisons had actual meaning and you could max Q instead of E if you wanted to play a poking style. You didn't HAVE to run in as a super squishy, immobile mage to capitalize on your already landed skillshot. Now was this the best and most efficient way to build her? Probably not, go ask King Cobra. However, it was enjoyable for the Cass player, and you couldn't 100 to 0 players at level 2 (which is the primary complaint I see people whining about for the new Cass). \n\nSecond: Old Cass could be built several different ways. While this is a similar point to #1, there is a contrast in build pattern. You could go pure AP with {{item:3020}} {{item:3089}} {{item:3157}} {{item:3135}} {{item:3040}} & DFG do deal punish enemies for not building MR. Or instead you could play the subtle poking game and wear down the defenses of tankier individuals by substituting in {{item:3116}} {{item:3151}}. Sure, you can still purchase Liandry but it is nowhere near as effective when you have to risk your bacon just to hit the tank with 3 Twin Fangs with puts your squishy mage ass in a autoattack range for 1.5 seconds. New Cass HAS to capitalize on her new passive by purchasing as much AP as possible in order to benefit from the % AP increase. It has shoehorned her build path into a singular build with maybe 1 exception to the clause being Rylai's since it's so good for her kiting.\n\nThird: As I mentioned briefly above, Old Cass (with the poking style) could not 100-0 you at level 2. She needed to whittle you down and land multiple skillshots in succession to bring you to a point where she could go all in with her twin fang (which by the way puts you in a very vulnerable position). How is that NOT a healthy gameplay pattern, landing multiple skillshots? I'm 95% positive that Cass players would've much rather chose a 1 second longer cooldown on her Q (which by the way she still got anyway in \"compensation\" for her 25% \"free\" CDR) instead of this halfway rework that has completely ruined both her identity and a whole playerbase that preferred one style of Cass over the other.\n\nFourth: Doesn't it make more sense as a snake/poison/seductress champion to whittle her opponents over time with poison? She makes you believe that you're not taking too much damage until it's too late. She'll let her poison do just the right amount of damage before finally going in for the final strike. HOW DOES IT MAKE ANY SENSE THAT NOW, WHEN I POISON PEOPLE, I GET STRONGER????\n\nTL;DR The old Cass has options to work with. She had a poking playstyle that required landing multiple skillshots in succession. She had less lane sustain, solving the problem that Rito has found now. Finally, her identity was upheld better in her older kit compared to her newer one.","replies":[{"poster":"jDVL20eCYs","date":"2015-05-25T18:55:26.300+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":13,"body":"haha.. .haha..\nokey first you play her the same as you always did. you mean you play cassia without ever sue your e? her kit is build around her e as much as syndras kit is build around her q and iris around her q and azirs around his w.\nshe is much healthier now then she was and she is the dps/dot hyper carry mage she was meant to be. if you want q poke  why not ziggs, karma?","replies":[{"poster":"Earthlord Jazz","date":"2015-05-25T20:26:01.500+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"The difference is older Cass did not fully depend on her E for damage. Have you seen the text for her E? Everything in her kit is tuned for one ability, so her other moves are nerfed. That is perfectly acceptable for Cass players that already used a Twin Fang style of play. Poison the enemy, and then jump on them for lots of damage.\n\nHowever, the rework ignored the other fanbase for Cass. Want to enhance your poison damage? Spam them with Twin Fang twice to get 40% increased damage. By that time, what's the point of me playing the subtle poisoning game? Might as well go all the way and hit them 4 or 5 times with Twin Fang. \n\nI do not want to play Ryze, I want to play a poison mage. Many people on the boards relate Cassiopeia to Rambo, saying this does not fix her character. A Twin Fang Rambo is not her identity: Not in the new lore Riot gave us and neither in her quotes.\n\n\nYou raise Syndra as an example.Remember back before the Syndra nerfs, Riot saw her as an early game lane bully that scaled well into the late game? How about instead of nerfing her damage and stun width, they went the route in nerfing both the cooldown and damage of her Q and making it so you have to hit your W to compensate for the reduced damage. Syndra's Q is what defines her, there's no doubt about that. Syndra mains would be vexed to see Riot take that path. Same with Cassiopeia players (or at least a good chunk of her playerbase from times past).\n\nThe difference between your examples is that those champions ALWAYS were defined by those abilities. Cass lore and quotes was defined for poison, and not for an AP Rambo style of play. Even though back then, the Twin Fang style of play was probably most efficient, people found it enjoyable to have presence in a teamfight without always relying on her Twin Fang.\n\nAnd for your final point of Ziggs and Karma...I have a hard time describing it. How about I put it this way: For years I've been wanting a puppeteer champion. Someone with actual puppets a la Sasori from the Akatsuki in Naruto. Puppets have always appealed to me. However, even though Azir is played like a puppeteer champion, he is more widely accepted as an Emperor and he does not use puppets per se. For some reason, I cannot bring myself to play Azir more than one or two times without getting bored of him. He is just not that interesting for me. He's still a great champion, just an emperor does not fit me as much as a puppeteer. The same goes for a Poison mage. I want to feel like my poison has meaninful value besides making my Twin Fang spam more powerful. I do not want to play a bomber nor an enlightened Ionian that shoots mystic shit out of her hands. I'd like the more poison-centric mage back.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Riot King Cobra","date":"2015-05-25T03:48:02.771+0000","up_votes":31,"down_votes":8,"body":"The nerfs make perfect sense.

Her Q has like, a cast time (green poison that explodes where you're at) so even if you're in it, you're not actually IN it for like a second.\n\nTake almost no poke from her if you can, if she pokes you she's not always doing it to get you low because it's extremely difficult for her to follow up without like 5 mana potions. When she pokes you she can get stacks of her Passive and if she keeps getting stacks she'll hit her mid and late game much faster.\n\nTo go on what I said, it's very difficult for a Cassiopeia to follow up early game with kills because of her crazy mana situation. She has low mana and her kit forces her to spam 2 - 3 abilities that drain her mana pool insanely quick. If she fails to kill you or follow up with her poke with a proper engage, she'll most likely be left with little to no mana and that's when you attack her. Her weakest despite her being able to bully you, is early game and her strongest is late game. Be warned though, when I say her strongest is late game I mean she does like 700 damage every .5 seconds on just one of her spells, not including her Q damage or W damage.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Scarlett Grimm","date":"2015-05-25T07:19:29.544+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":4,"body":"The rework just about killed her, they moved everything from her poisons (which now do a pitiful amount of damage) and into her E completely destroying her identity as a DoT mage.

The changes are going to push Cassiopeia into a bad state where she isn't going to be picked over other champions because she doesn't bring anything special. \n\nBalance changes shouldn't be made based on FOTM, yes she does well right now because of the types of champions being picked, and she didn't do well before because of the types of champions picked.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Martyrofsand","date":"2015-05-25T19:57:03.973+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Sadly as much as I love Cassio she needs some pretty significant changes because as she is now she really can't be healthy in the game.  Her remake has brought a new problem to light, not really with her so much as with the itemization of league of legends itself.  Magic resist is not designed to be able to deal with a champion capable of putting out the constant damage Cassio can put out.  Sure there are some other constant damage mages like Karthus but his damage is spread out among a team where as Cassio's is tunneled into 1 person.\n\nThis creates a massive problem in that you simply can't itemize against Cassio.  Even if you stack both Banshee's/Locket/Visage/mercs to try and account for her it isn't going to give you enough magic resist to account for her damage.  You end up with 150 magic resist, which can be enough for a normal mages burst and then kill them while their spells are on CD, but Cassio's damage doesn't go on CD, she just continues to pump out a ton of damage and eat you alive inspite of all that magic resist.\n\nIn this regard the Cassio rework is broken.  Not because of \"it doesn't fit with her character\" not because \"to much is loaded onto the E\" but simply because there is no way to itemize against it in the game.  Now it may sound simple to just say \"well bring back force of nature\" or \"add more magic resist items\" and think that will fix the problem.  Thing is, it might fix the Cassio problem but then it creates a problem for every other mage in the game.  If people have enough Magic Resist to absorb the damage of someone like a Cassio how are other mages like Xerith/Orianna/Syndra/Viktor/etc etc who couldn't even hope to reach Cassio's potential damage suppose to compete?  \n\nThis in the end brings us back to Cassio herself.  While I have come to enjoy her rework and have had a lot of fun playing it, and it is indeed powerful, in the end it is a broken design with how mages are set up in league of legends.  If you create magic resist to make it possible to itemize against her you make other mages unplayable.  If you nerf her damage then she isn't going to be able to compete or be viable.  Nerfing her sustain and her mana regen isn't going to fix the problem, she will still be perfectly fine with tear and she will have enough sustain to get through the laning phase against most opponents.  Simply put you can't fix the problems the rework has created without creating far worse problems.  She is going to need another rework, something that really reinvents her in a way that can be made healthy in league.  Sadly she has yet to really exist in such a fashion.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot King Cobra","date":"2015-05-25T20:58:28.661+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I disagree with this. Cassio, with the upcoming sustain nerfs, is perfectly healthy in the game. The fact that you can't stack MR and survive her damage if she manages to get it all off is the entire point of Cassio. You take her out fast or you are punished. \nIf you let Cass get her items then that's your fault for not shutting her down. The nerfs should make her easier to punish in lane. \n\nCassio's design is perfectly acceptable if you ask me. She trades instant burst damage for sustained damage that eats through MR and health.. It's the reason she excels in this tank meta. She's not inherently broken because your MR can't handle 5 seconds of constant Twin Fang, she just does well against the popular champions because they can't instagib her and she can sustain through their comparatively mediocre damage. When tanks stop being popular and assassins/early pressure junglers come back into flavor you will see a lot less of Cassio because she can't deal with that well. And then people will stop complaining about her and start complaining that the popular champions are broken because of something along the lines of \"you can't itemize against their burst because then you do no damage yourself.\" \n\nIs Cassio really good right now? Yeah - this is the perfect meta for her - 1-2 threat enemy comps that don't have a lot of dive. When the reign of tanks comes to an end, Cassio will most likely become a niche pick again because she is super easy to take out with multi-threat dive/assassin comps.","replies":[{"poster":"Martyrofsand","date":"2015-05-25T21:39:46.691+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"I'm gonna have to disagree with you on this one.  Even you yourself have said Cassio doesn't really have a bad match-up, even back when Zed/Leblanc were FoTM, and how many times have we seen a Cassio sporting Exhaust wreck these assassins that are suppose to destroy her?  Are highly mobile assassins good against Cassio?  No doubt, but do they out right counter and/or stop her?  No they don't.\n\nCassio is suppose to be the AP ADC, the problem with this though is that there is currently armor itemization against ADCs that can make it difficult for ADCs to just melt people, it's fine for them because AD damage in this game is designed around being constant and high, as such armor can be stacked up to extremely high levels, I've seen people break 400 armor in this game, and the resistance is very noticeable.  You can't do that with magic resist because there simply isn't enough of it.\n\nCassio doesn't shred magic resist, there simply isn't enough magic resist to account for her damage and if their was then other AP champions wouldn't be able to compete.  That is the problem this Cassio rework has brought to light.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot King Cobra","date":"2015-05-25T22:12:17.004+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm not talking about wrecking her in lane. Sure, she doesn't have a lot of poor lane matchups, there a few champions like her in that regard - Orianna and Syndra (who actually beats Cassio in lane) to name a couple. And that's OK - League isn't a 1v1 game. Also, in competitive I don't think Zed or LB have been picked into Cassio that much so we haven't seen a Cassio sporting Exhaust wreck any assassins really. \n\nIf Cassio falls behind, it's extremely easy to snowball a game against her. She's insanely item dependent - if a tank gets ahead and gets some MR she'll go OOM trying to burn them down before she kills them. \n\nCassio really only has her consistent damage going for her. That's all she ever has had. She doesn't bring the utility of Orianna or the catch potential of Syndra and Ahri. Saying she's broken because its hard to stop her by building resist when she gets her core items is ridiculous because that's the whole point. If she gets her items it should be expected that she's going to be shredding the tanks that other mages can't.\n\n And sure, I think she should be allowed to do far more sustained damage than ADCs - they have the ability to burn down structures a lot faster than she does and their damage is all resource-less point and click. \n\nRight now Cassio is built completely glass cannon because she can get away with it since nobody is going to be diving her. When the enemy has a Kha'Zix jungle, Fizz mid, and heavy engage top like Malphite you can bet your ass Cassio is going to die regardless of Seraph's shield and Zhonya's unless she has a Janna sitting on her if she builds like she does now. And if she doesn't build like she does now then she doesn't do the insane damage that you are saying is OP. \n\nCassio didn't bring to light an MR itemization problem. If she can't burn down the full build Mundo and Gragas when she's rolling then there's seriously no point in picking Cassiopeia because in that case you're better off picking a champion that can easily get to the enemy carries and take them out fast - which Cassio can only do if they position poorly and she catches them with a flash ult or something that shouldn't happen.\n ","replies":[{"poster":"Martyrofsand","date":"2015-05-25T22:47:02.145+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"We actually saw it when it was fnatic vs Unicorns of Love for the Cassio vs Leblanc match-up.  There where several highlights to consider including Leblanc jumping on Cass just to east exhaust+ult and die while doing all of 25% of Cassio's HP in damage.  \n\nSame game had a lovely 4 man gank on Cassio and Nunu that saw Cassio kill leblanc and Lissandra before eventually dieing to the Sej and Naut.  \n\nNote both of those plays where all done before Cassio had more than a tear built.  This idea that her early game damage is lacking straight up wrong.\n\nAs for this idea that \"Cassio with items should be able to destroy others\" just think about that statement for a moment.  If Cassio is ahead I would agree she should be melting people, anyone that is ahead should be.  Thing is I'm not talking about being ahead.  I'm talking about a tank with 3 magic resist items and merc treads vs an AP carry with equal items and those magic resist items being irrelevant.  \n\nWe went through this once with assassins having so much armor pen/shred that armor was irrelevant and it was just as toxic and stupid then as the issue with Cassio is.  If you are a tank building correctly then there should be a reward for that and dieing to Q+6E spam from Cass most certainly isn't rewarding.  \n\nTo deny that magic resist itemization is not set up for a champion like Cassio is simply crazy and to think its healthy is even crazier.  I get she is your main and you love playing her and you love how strong she is, but if you step back and look at magic resist items in league, the mentality behind why people have built magic resist in the past and then look at what Cassio does its pretty clear why the set up is in fact broken.\n\nOh and for the record I never said Cassio was OP.  I've said it in several thread but I will say it in this one...\n\nBroken =/= OP\n\nIt is possible for a champion to be worthless yet broken and OP but not broken.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot King Cobra","date":"2015-05-25T23:20:21.340+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's the point of taking exhaust though and that was good play on PowerofEvil's part. He outplayed LeBlanc hard with his ultimate prediction and was rewarded for that. In regards to the 4 man gank on Cassio and Nunu, if you watch the gank play out, Sejuani used all of her cooldowns on Nunu (wiffed her ult), Nautilus was level 5 and used his anchor on Nunu, LeBlanc used her abilities on Nunu, and Lissandra came in late. That was basically Cassio freely beating on Leblanc while she focused Nunu then 1v1'ing the Lissandra while still having exhaust up because the two tanks had all their abilities on cooldown. Cassio had a tear, Sorc Shoes, 2 Doran's Rings, and a Null Magic Mantle. So she had way more than just a Tear.\n\nA tank with Randuins, Frozen Heart, Thornmail vs  a Vayne with BT, Botrk, and PD will probably still lose to the Vayne if she plays it right. Some champions excel at 1v1 extended dueling. I can easily say that the Cassio building and playing correctly should be rewarded for doing so by being able to 1v1 the MR stacking tank because that's what Cassio is supposed to be able to do. Cassio counters tanks - that's her niche and why she is popular. You're basically saying she's broken because she is good at what she's supposed to do and it's entirely a slippery slope argument. \n\nBeyond all that, if you actually think about in practice, the Mundo or Sejuani with Spirit Visage, Warmogs, Banshees, Mercs will probably destroy a Cassio with Seraph, Abyssal, Void. It's when she hits 500 stacks + DCap + Void that tanks have to be weary of her because that's the point where her life vamp becomes relevant and their damage falls off. \n\nAnd I'm not denying that magic resist itemization is not set up for Cassio - it isn't. If all mages were able to put out sustained damage like she and ADCs could then MR itemization would be in a pretty sour place. What I'm saying is that it isn't a problem because the only champion that benefits from that lack of itemization is a full build Cassio and that's exactly the point of Cassio - if you don't kill her she's going to take out everybody on your team. It's not a sign of a broken mechanic or champion. It's literally as simple as: the meta is saturated with tanky champions and Cassio is a counter to them because of her immense sustained damage - same reason why Azir and Vlad are popular. When the late game scaling tanks of top lane and jungle fall out of meta, then you'll probably see the late game team fight oriented champions fall off as well in favor of pick-oriented and poke-oriented ones that excel early to mid game.\n\nI'm not defending her because I main her and enjoy seeing her strong. I agree with the nerfs. I'm just calling you out on something that is not correct. Cassio's resurgence as a top tier pick does NOT highlight that she is broken by design due to how she scales beyond the resistances provided by MR stacking. That statement is just a gross complication and sensationalist way of stating her intended strength - she is a counter-pick to MR stacking tanks and tanks in general. ","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
