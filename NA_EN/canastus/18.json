By that I mean we should be able to see the common themes of the feedback and work towards that.  \n\nThere's likely a million ways to adjust Cass ... or any champion really.  The key for me is that we can map the changes back to the concerns.  If we can:  we are getting progress.  If we can't ... we are wasting time.\n\nI'm not convinced the poison tweak addresses the champion issues ... so focusing on tweaking the numbers feels premature to me at this point.\n\nTo type the percieved issues out for the {{champion:26}}th time:\n\n1.  Her Passive is unsatisfying and thematically goes against the champion theme/character\n2.  Too much of her power budget is placed in her \"e\", which over simplifies everything from gear purchasing to game play.\n3.   Poison has been de-emphasized and is no longer \"core\" to the champion identity.\n\nThere's a \"hidden 4th issue\" around if hyper-carry should even be a role for her ... but personally  I've felt our chance to impact that decision is too late, so it's best to focus on the areas we CAN impact:  game play and character theme.  \n\nI'm rather in \"spaghetti mode\":  keep throwing ideas out there until something sticks.

With the PBE passive adjustment this doesn't synergize with getting stacks at ALL.

I have to last hit with E to get mana back while poisoning the enemy champ to get passive stacks?  if i don't efficiently last hit with E I go OOM (a common complaint) so I wont be able to stack poison on the enemy champ.   At the end of the day this extra resource management wont get me any lane power as we are deliberately using a passive to gate her early game so it's a ton of work just so we can carry 10 minutes sooner?\n\nI could be in theorycraft over-drive but the idea of keeping \"e\" powerful to ease in last hitting implies the E really is and truly  an AA replacement which is ... well ... interesting.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DreMLoK","date":"2014-12-03T00:55:21.861+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":3,"body":"> This is a good question.

A long overdue PBE update rolls out with a series ofchanges that were heatly debated for weeks that helps emphasize poison (see key issue #2).\n2.  The new change is nearly immediately scaled back.\n\nSo what we have is a community that has been pushing HARD for a certain change in Cassi only to see it arise and get scaled back in a matter of days befoer ever going live.

(I think) Well, that won't do, it's backwards thinking, right? So, Stashu raises base damage on Noxious Blast back to 75/115/155/195/235 and nerfed the poison amp on Twin Fang, therefore scaling back the power of the \"buff\" without reducing Noxious Blast's base damage. Someone please respond if I am incorrect, but I think the base damage on Noxious Blast has not been touched if this youtube video is correct. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdN37EhNrVg At about 2:02 you can see the base damage on Noxious Blast. Thus, the changes are indeed a strict buff... if not a perfect one.\n\nI still we've got a long ways to go before Cass isn't so reliant on Twin Fang. My problem is that she may be in a balanced spot after the changes, but she won't be fiXed. She'll still be focused on Twin Fang spam. She won't be fun. She still won't be the poison mage.

Stashu has not given any indication of changing her back into the interesting playstyle she had before the rework, despite all of the literally thousands of forum posts saying they do not like the single target hypercarry direction for Cass. The rest of Riot seems to have his back on this, so the Cass we knew and loved for years is gone for good.\n\nI for one, am pretty turned off of Cass and can't bring myself to even take her into a normals match. It's like playing Caitlin because you loved having the longest early game range and really good early game harass and power, and then they cut her range in half and make her have an inherent Runaans effect. Sure, you can turn that into a balanced champ at with enough tweaking, but it isn't the same champ in any regard.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"The Red Warden","date":"2014-12-02T23:29:53.523+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"Wait for when he says \"the passive made the boosted poison do too much damage so we nerfed the boost on poison\".
