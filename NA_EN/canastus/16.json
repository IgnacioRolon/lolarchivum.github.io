Upgrading an item should be because you want what the item gives. Upgrading to Athene's provides you with a bunch of AP and CDR plus the other Unique Passive at a reasonable price.\n\nUpgrading to Mikael's gives you its incredibly Unique Active on top of some other stats alongside.\n\nWhat what it's worth, I prefer that upgrades be somewhat of a choice. I like when items add a little something different as they move upward, it lets me help tailor my build to the specifics I want.","replies":[{"poster":"Ding an Sich","date":"2014-06-19T00:43:50.607+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel mentioning it still is one of the last items to give 20% cdr is a huge boon too.

It was bought in 90% of games. That's pretty crazy. Itemization is supposed to be a choice. Keep in mind, this is an item bought BY mages, and works AGAINST mages. So it's not like the MR reduction nerfed the mage class, it just made the mage vs mage matchup a bit squishier, or incentivized other item purchases. It doesn't shift class balance anywhere. It's not like Zed is now\n\nAs far as the mana regen nerfs: It was not nerfed by 33%. It literally couldn't be. Most of the mana regen on the item actually came from the Unique Passive. So instead of contributing 15-30 mp5 plus up to double your mp5, it contributes 10-20 mp5 plus up to double your base mp5. Additionally, it provides even further mana restore on kill or assist.\n\nWhat this means is that the item does two things:\n\n1. It is still the number one mana regeneration item. Don't be silly. The unique passive basically guarantees that. It doesn't also need to be the best AP/CDR and defensive item too.\n\n2. It works better alongside other mana itemization, because if you buy flat mana (Archangels, RoA) it will restore more on Kill/Assist, or continues to multiply your other sources of regen (Morellonomicon, Archangel's, etc.)","replies":[{"poster":"3mptylord","date":"2014-06-19T11:29:14.068+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you ever considered making Mana Font work like Spirit Visage? \"Your mana restoration effects are increased by 1% for every 1% of your missing mana.\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"Penguin Eclipse","date":"2014-06-19T00:44:27.853+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"If you wanted to create more choice in itemization, wouldn't it have made sense to not nerf Morellonomicon?
