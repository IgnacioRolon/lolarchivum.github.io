Apparently it's impossible to balance this old goat as long as her current kit remains in place.**\n\nWe know, she used to be a dedicated healer but you radically nerfed the effectiveness of her heals and reduced the armor buffs on her W. Next you took the damage from her starcall and slapped a ridiculously low ap ratio on it. Bear in mind, that was still during pre-season.\n\nThen people started to play her as a solo-laner since her ability to support was less than favorable after what you've done to her. She already lacked any form of peel and her damage was abysmal. So naturally all she could do was try to sustain herself while farming on a solo-lane to get that gold which she could impossibly acquire as a support (it takes 600 AP (!) just to undo your season 4 nerfs).\n\nNow that patch 4.8 is here, we're dealt with another wave of Soraka nerfs. This time you've reduced the damage on her starcall EVEN more and added a mana-cost to the only reliable form of poke she had, her silence. You claim to only weaken solo-lane Soraka with those changes but actually you've killed support Soraka aswell.\n\nNo more silencing people while throwing bananas at them. How do you expect to pay for those insanely mana-hungry heals if she already used up most of her mana-pool after applying a short-lived silence that costs 50 mana (!) and yet only deals a laughable amount of damage? It used to be tolerable since it was a free ability but now it's entirely unacceptable.\n\nYou never really calculated her overall mana-costs apparently. You may have not have realized it yet but you've made her gameplay even more passive since she can't even poke people anymore. Where's the interaction with the other player which you've wanted the entire time?\n\n**Since you clearly refuse to buff Soraka in her current state, we've got to ask ourselves: what's next? How about that rework which you've been talking about for god knows how long? Time's running out for this old goat and all you do is watch as she slowly dies.**","replies":[{"poster":"Morello","date":"2014-05-22T21:23:30.827+0000","up_votes":26,"down_votes":1,"body":"Couldn't agree more.

She became FOTM because some people didn't know her counters and they were playing all in champs.  There was QQing on the forums because the FOTM crowd for the most part doesn't understand picks, counter picks, and countering other player's picks in most cases.\n\nNow that the nerf is going into effect, more and more people who were fans will be crying for Riot to rework soraka.  Thus making the radical changes more palatable to the player base at large. \n\nAs a developer, you can't just rework a champ with a strong fanbase that you don't like.

That was less an issue of balance/counterplay and more about telegraphing. Soraka is problematic for an entirely different reason: all of her win conditions rely on the removal of counterplay.\n2. Karma fans were sad to see their classy out-of-place matron turn into a psionic monk with governess backstory. She turned into a totally different person. Soraka already had her visual changes, and apparently people are fine with this current look. (I don't like the humanization and severe age-reduction she got, but that's just me.\n3. Karma had a VERY small fanbase, and our feedback was almost entirely dismissed. Even after the rework went through and the concerns still existed, Riot just sort of... stopped talking about it.

I made my own lame attempt at an alternative idea [here](http://community.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/live-gameplay/ZNUnngdq-soraka-re-work-based-on-veshs-guidelines). It involves giving Soraka stacks of a buff for engaging in combat. Her heal consumes stacks, and if she doesn't have any to consume, it takes a percent of her health. This way, she chooses between taking enemy attacks or her own self-damage. \n\nThe important difference between this and the \"infuse healer\" models I've seen proposed on the forums is that she might be able to remain a squishy champion with it, and I think the incentives are more clear cut than the infuse model.

Every champion has one, and as long as that concept is kept in mind, one doesn't have to bother with the ridiculous balancing of \"champ X does Y, but this champ does exactly the same thing!\".\n\nIn my opinion, Soraka's core concept seems to be longevity. She wants to drag fights out as long as possible, slowly giving her marksmen/team the edge in the battle. If we carry this core concept, we can break her down into design variables to determine her scope (fancy talk for what her kit does individually).\n\nRight now, Soraka's current kit has the following: zoning (Q), MR shred (Q), heal (W and R), silence (E), and mana restore (E). Sorry, but that tiny damage from E isn't very consequential in the games I've played with her, so I don't count it.\n\nWhat's the issue with that picture? All of the top played supports have at least some form of engage or peel, and, in many cases, both. Thresh has his hook and flay for both, Leona has a hard engage followed up with sustained lockdown, etc, etc.\n\nWe also have to observe the issue that pure blood supports (also known as classic supports) such as Janna and Sona and falling by the wayside due to the changes in the game. Supports have quickly morphed into a off-carry type of role, due to Riot's changes, player mentality, and simply what the game rewards in a design sense.\n\nBearing all this in mind, the following bullet list can be gained:\n\n1) She must be able to sustain her team in varied situations.\n2) She must be able to either peel or initiate.\n3) She must be able to off-carry, if given the opportunity. If not, then she must be able to provide enough in other categories to compensate.\n\nSo let's make Soraka into a sustain monster, capable of NOT carrying her team, but easily able to push her team to victory by dragging fights out. There's a few ways to do this: heals over time (HOTs), damage share/split (en-kor from MTG), or stay her current course.\n\nI lean towards a split of HOT and damage share/split, like so.\n\nPassive: When an ally that Soraka has placed a heal on reaches full health, that heal is passed on to the nearest allied champion and refreshes its duration.\n\nQ: Ally cast: The ally is healed for a small amount over the duration. If the target did not reach full health by the end of the duration, half of this spells cost is refunded.\n\nEnemy cast: Silence the target for 0.5 seconds.\n\nW: Soraka creates a zone of celestial energy on the ground, providing armor/MR bonus to all allied champions that stand inside. Additionally, all enemies passing through this zone are slowed.\n\nE: Soraka creates a link with an allied champion (picture a white Karma link), healing it over the duration. Whenever that champion would receive damage, half is dealt to Soraka instead.\n\nR: places a celestial boon on all allied champions, healing them each second over its duration (duration extends based on level).\n\nThe Q is super sloppy imo, but I think these all somewhat form the idea of what I think Soraka should do: a classic support that can be brought up to a new level.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Absolute Soul","date":"2014-05-23T06:19:36.465+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"played her support with the new patch, they couldn't have nerfed her more if they'd taken her out of the game.

I mained Soraka SUPPORT, but was well aware of her solo lane capabilities. I was happy with Soraka before as a support, heals, mana, silence and harass with Q. The damage now is laughable, so much so that the two games I've played with her since 4.8 I have never felt more useless in all my time playing Soraka.  What's hilarious is that enemies know she can't do damage now, so she is easy pickings with no ability to peel or defend herself, at least before people were afraid of getting hit by starcall more than a few times, now I am just a walking summoner spell Heal/Clarity.  I have no ability what so ever to bring pressure into the lane, making it far too easy to push back my ADC (sorry, Marksman!!)\n\nTo be honest I'm not understanding why you bothered buffing supports for season 4 with AP scaling on their moves, then nerfing them once they leave the bot lane, while Quinn and Vayne can wreck top, Riven can feast on mid champs, Braum can Jungle and I've been dealing with nothing but kill lanes bot for the last two days.  I feel almost useless as a support unless I'm playing Morgana, Annie, Orianna, Braum, Thresh or Leona.  It seems all that's happened is this season has paved a path for tank supports while leaving true utility based supports in the dust. Lulu's tiny nerf hurt her support, Soraka as mentioned above is laughable, Janna has no damage what so ever ( but I love her utility!!), Sona is in a terrible place at this moment, and Nami is, well, Nami.\n\nI thank you guys for trying to buff supports with income items, and their new scaling, but to be honest support is still in a bad place right now. As aggressive as bot lane and jungle have become, True utility supports are having a hard time, so are any  Marksmen ( let's face it we all still call them ADC's) that aren't Lucian Vayne or Cait!!","replies":[]}]}
