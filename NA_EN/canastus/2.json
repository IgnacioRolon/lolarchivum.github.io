Your history with this champion is by no means a happy one, it&#039;s a rather sad one.\n___________________________________________\n\n**We&#039;re all aware how you missed the mark with her rework:** champion identity? Gone, her poison damage basically removed in favor of Twin Fang spam - and don&#039;t get me even started on the butchered lore. Playerbase? Drastically reduced by half (!) since the rework happened. Fun? There&#039;s nothing enjoyable about playing this binary mess while being chained to an extremely late powerspike which you&#039;ll probably never hit. Most of the time you&#039;re just playing a handicapped champion who doesn&#039;t get to reach their full potential.\n\n**Pre-season has turned this game into a hellhole for Cassiopeia due to games ending far too quickly** all thanks to your extremely problematic snowball-mechanics. All she can do is try to survive for 40 minutes before becoming somewhat useful, and even then her lategame is vastly overrated and doesn&#039;t ever exceed a 50% winrate at that point (also let me remind you, her winrate's between 39-43% during the first 25 minutes). Care to remind me why she&#039;s worth the effort again?\n\nBut like I said earlier, MOST games don&#039;t even last that long. And you&#039;re still pretty much relying on your teammates to keep you alive, she&#039;s by no means capable of 1v5ing like she used to before the rework when she was capable of melting entire teams with her Q and W. **It&#039;s beyond me how you could even consider a short ranged, squishy, immobile caster with a strict focus on single target-damage to be a RELIABLE hypercarry.** This goes beyond common logic, it simply doesn&#039;t make any sense. **Let&#039;s also not forget that she&#039;s unable of switching targets as easily as a real marksman.**\n\nMeanwhile your dear teammates have to deal with a rather passive midlaner while she&#039;s trying to stay in her safe-zone, the game&#039;s basically a 4v5 if you&#039;re trying to avoid death at all costs. **And you REALLY don&#039;t want to die on Cassiopeia**, every single second you spend on farming minions counts here. **Unlike other champions, Cassiopeia&#039;s powerspike is gated through two instances** - her passive stacks AND her gold income. And both are strictly linked to each other, falling behind in farm can easily ruin the game for her. Just ganking her 1-2 times in lane is enough to shut her down for the rest of the game.\n\n**Let me ask you, WHO even WANTS to play this champion anymore?** Who can say they&#039;re enjoying themselves while playing this extremely unreliable and binary champion? Who even wants to see a Cassiopeia on their team nowadays? Your rework has caused far more damage than you could imagine, this has gone beyond mere viability at this point. I&#039;m talking about Cassio&#039;s reputation here. \n\nHave you seen how little sympathy Cassiopeia receives within the community itself? You&#039;re lucky enough to even find artwork of her (kudos to the talented people out there who have drawn her), let alone any merchandise. **I don&#039;t even recall you ever granting her any fanservice** - no summoner icon, no skins (it&#039;s been almost 3 years since Jade Fang Cass came out), no animations (neither fanmade nor official), no stickers, no figurine, simply NOTHING.\n\n**We&#039;re dealing with an ongoing history of negligence here**, there&#039;s no doubt. Heck, even Mordekaiser&#039;s rework is receving more care and attention right now than Cassiopeia&#039;s back then, and since then you hardly tried to even make up for your shortcomings. Instead of raising to the challenge you tried your hardest to shove her carCASS under the carpet, it&#039;s too bad the noticeable bulge she left behind couldn&#039;t be easily ignored like that.\n___________________________________________\n\nI simply don&#039;t understand you anymore. **First you admit that she&#039;s in a bad spot with the initial rework failing to meet its goals, and yet you refuse to even touch her?** I&#039;ve checked the PBE countless times and she didn&#039;t receive any changes on there, what are you even doing with her? Yes, she needs another rework but that&#039;s no reason to let us wait for god knows how long until that happens. [Didn&#039;t you say that you&#039;d look into the immobile mage-update during mid 2016? That&#039;s most likely another six months of waiting, and YOU CAN&#039;T EVEN GUARANTEE that she&#039;ll be affected by it.](http://i.imgur.com/kRnP4Zu.png)\n\n**Listen, all I&#039;m asking for is something to work with until her time has come.** Would it be too much to ask for a reversal on some of those nerfs she received between patch 5.2 and 5.10? I&#039;m talking about manacosts, because her Twin Fang ability right now is just too expensive with its 90 mana (the same goes for her Q cost which was raised from 60 to 80). Also let&#039;s not forget the devastating nerf to her sustain by HALVING her mana refund and spellvamp ratio. **The closest thing to a truly viable rework Cassiopeia was her 4.21-self  so why not revert her to a similiar state until you&#039;ve got her next rework ready?**","replies":[{"poster":"Blainezy","date":"2015-12-23T01:33:19.279+0000","up_votes":57,"down_votes":3,"body":"Highly upsetting that they are all gung-ho to fix mordekaiser nonstop but still won't make the slightest effort to fix our beloved snake lady.","replies":[{"poster":"Retillin","date":"2015-12-23T02:33:44.319+0000","up_votes":42,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"fix\" Morde nonstop might be a bit wrong.

Her old passive kept up her spellcasting thanks to the reduced mana usage it gave, made it ideal to use Q and E then W so that the high mana cost on the W wouldn't be so high and there'd be an actual strategy on how to cast her abilities.

He's said in the past that new Cass is strong, but I'm still struggling with her the past several patches, maybe he's made a revision?\n\nAnyways, thanks again for bringing her to board attention, as I'd personally love for her to fallback to her original style (of which even then there was a divide amongst maxing Q first compared to E) where she could appeal to a larger playerbase and actually mean something when behind.","replies":[{"poster":"Queen Cassiopeia","date":"2015-12-23T03:23:44.574+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"King Cobra is ... akward...\n\nHe never changed his mind about Cassio.\nWether if she was patched good, old cassio or the bad one right now... he is allways \"Ok\"...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Riot King Cobra","date":"2015-12-23T17:19:36.864+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":4,"body":"I think Cassio is alright right now. She's not a top tier mid laner but she's probably tier 1 (with Viktor and Lulu being top tier). Despite what OP claims, Cassio's laning is amongst the still amongst the strongest. High elo players are still managing to find plenty of success with her. The Rod of Ages buffs really benefit her more than other mages since she isn't giving up CDR for it (like a Lulu, Lissandra, or Orianna would) and she can afford to go Sorc Shoes or Merc Treads as well (something other mages can't if they opt for RoA if they want to hit a CDR cap) so she gets additional power there as well. \n\nI have no opinion on the supposed shift in her playstyle. I played Cassio before her rework because of her ability to duel (her single target damage) so I like the fact that Riot gave her a niche of being a mage that does super high single target dps as opposed to another AOE damage control mage. \n\nAll that being said, I think Cassio could use a few slight buffs. Personally, I'd like to see her passive stacks lowered because games seem to be shorter. If not that, I don't think it'd be a poor idea to reduce the mana cost of the later levels of Twin Fang. \n\nAnyways, I can't stand the fact that people think her laning is weak. She becomes extremely annoying to lane against as soon as she so much as a mana crystal to enable her some all-in threat without going oom. Here's a video somebody uploaded of one of my games on Cassio after her nerfs (but before pre-season): [Cass vs Viktor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TdGf3qkvxw)\n\nIf you watch that you'll see she's plenty viable still.\n\nTL;DR: I think Cass is in an OK spot, could maybe use a buff to her passive or mana costs but that's it really for short-term stuff. Her laning is not weak by any means.","replies":[{"poster":"Quepha","date":"2015-12-23T18:13:29.297+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=King Cobra,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=EJRHGTlK,comment-id=000e0002,timestamp=2015-12-23T17:19:36.864+0000)\n> \n> I have no opinion on the supposed shift in her playstyle.

I really want something that can spam debuffs on a target and get them to the point where they'll die even if they kill me first, or they try to get away but my poison kills them in the fog of war. But according to Riot that stuff isn't fun enough for me compared to the people whou would lose to it to justify making a champion like that.\n\nI also don't understand how Cass can fit into a niche with how much mobility there is in the game and how many other options there are for her niche. Why doesn't Ryze end up in that niche when he still does ridiculous single target midrange dps while being tanky enough to take a hit? Why not Zyra who has better cc and has a MUCH STRONGER team fight ult? Azir seems to have the same potential for dps but he gets mobility, hard cc, and that ridiculous ult...","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Canastus","date":"2015-12-23T02:58:12.727+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Cassiopeia holds a very special place in my heart, after all she's the reason I even started playing this game way back then.

I remember Cassiopeia Bot getting suuuuper fed consistently in bot games and thought id try her out. She was tricky, but fun, and rewarding when played well.\n\nSo i rolled her in ARAM last night (kinda wish i didn't have her unlocked anymore...bought her pre rework) and was reminded why i stopped playing her. FYI we won and I did 60k damage, 20k+ more than any other player in the game. So great I did awesome right?! I guess, but it wasn't fun in the slightest. Instead of landing relevant poke with Q, and having the option to level Q first, you just fish for hits with Q. Land one? proceed to go all in mashing E as fast as possible. Wasn't fun for me, and sure wasn't fun for my opponents who, if they ate one Q, instantly lose half HP and/or die. \n\nher kit seems like it would be rewarding..you have to scale up and get through early/mid game to really get strong (oh wait...games are WAY more snowbally now...late game is more of an unusual occurrence these days). Then, you have to hit a fairly difficult skillshot to unlock her damage. \n\nIt's hard to put my finger on it, but just mashing E as fast as you can isn't engaging. Please, her abilities still function basically the same, it's just that 95% of her basic ability damage is died to E. PLEASE RIOT just redistribute that damage from E to mainly Q, and some more into W. \n\nas it stands, she is no poison mage. Poison in games always calls to mind DoT. Cass? Not a DoT mage. Scaling hyper carry (as she always was and should remain imo), whose damage is point and click. Basically a magic damage spell marksman. Marksmen damage is tied to point and click aa...this is basically what Cass is now.\n\nLastly, there is no DoT mage in this game. While she wasn't a pure DoT mage before, why can't more of her damage be DoT. It would honestly be more unique than what we have now.\n\nand don't gimme that \"she was played in the LCS\" crap. yeah, because her damage is STUPID and those highly coordinated teams can set her up for success.
