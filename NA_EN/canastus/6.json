[It took us a great deal of effort to finally get Stashu back](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/A9MgbKkB-riot-care-to-explain-why-youve-entirely-abandoned-cassiopeia-in-418) and what does he do? [He simply disappears after dropping off another excuse](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/gFME3v51-on-the-future-of-cassiopeia-also-some-background), just like last time. **The guy literally admitted in his thread that the rework was RUSHED due to time constraints from the Shurima event and now we're stuck with a mutilated snakelady. **He even had the audacity to tell us that there's nothing immediate planned for her. Did it ever occur to you that we want to have a talk with the people responsible for destroying the identity and viability of our favorite champion?\n\n**Now we've arrived at the main issue of this entire rework, this total lack of communication.** I've seen other reworks and they certainly recieved a lot more care than this one. Actual threads created ahead of time (can't say the same about the Cass one on GD) and ongoing dialogue between the project leader(s) and the affected playerbase. None of this took place for Cassiopeia, we didn't even get a single pinned thread. [Speaking of that, how about you finally pin this one?](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/gFME3v51-on-the-future-of-cassiopeia-also-some-background) \n\n**It's almost as if you're desperately trying to sweep this entire thing under the carpet, but I won't let you.** Not after what you've done to her. If you really want to know why we're so upset with the rework, I strongly advise reading our feedback. Beause so far I've got the impression that you did no such thing. What you need to do is to actually start doing something about this - the longer it takes for you to fix this mess, the longer we suffer. We haven't seen a single trace of PBE changes since several weeks for poor Cass, that needs to change.\n\n**I expect you to start acting like a team that respects its playerbase along with its beloved champions** because this is NOT how you should handle a rework. Bring back Stashu and tell him to take this more seriously. Make him talk **with** us, not **against** us - convince him if you have to. I could have easily posted all of this into his own thread but at this point I doubt that he even pays attention to what we're saying, otherwise this could have been prevented a long time ago. **I'll keep posting about this matter until you've finally taken some action.**\n_______________________\n**Edit:** If you wish to gain a better insight into our reasoning, [I highly suggest reading this post.](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/Tf8gcj9v-riot-when-will-you-finally-listen-to-cassiopeias-playerbase?comment=0027)","replies":[{"poster":"jjookkeerr","date":"2014-10-19T18:50:57.165+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":5,"body":"the same day they will listen to lb playerbase","replies":[{"poster":"gubigubi","date":"2014-10-19T19:50:02.376+0000","up_votes":36,"down_votes":3,"body":"I would tell you to be silent but I cant make people do that anymore.\n{{champion:7}} {{item:3070}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"1nixia","date":"2014-10-20T17:33:23.917+0000","up_votes":28,"down_votes":2,"body":"For those new to the discussion, here's what I gather are many of the reasons why other Cassiopeia players are generally not happy with the rework:\n\n-The new passive combined with low dmg scaling- which makes her very vulnerable early and mid game, and focuses her playstyle on farming minions/stacks and playing passively which is less fun for many who enjoyed her early game harrass and more consistent dmg contribution to games. There are  concerns the passive kicks in too late, she is less versatile with roles (her build path is more linear), and also that her design doesn't really support her carrying well in late game (range, escape options, setup time, dmg scaling, etc..)\n\n-Pretty significant mana issues early on- because of the reliance on spamming a fairly mana intensive ability- twin fang to defend herself (and if twin fang doesn't snag a kill on a minion she doesn't get the refund).  This causes her to have to back early and rush tear. And combined with the passive means she can't wander out of lane much until later.\n\n-Her DOT/Poison identity has been drastically reduced, which is what some felt was core to a snake themed champion like Cassiopeia- Her Q and W both have pretty mild dmg outputs now, and she has lost her ability to harrass and aoe in favor of Twin Fang dives (which may be riskier for a character who is squishy and lacking escapes). This also means that point investments in these two abilities after the initial point don't really mean as much. To add to that part of the reason it was reduced is bc Riot felt her DOT theme clashed with other champions like \"Brand, Rumble, Swain, Zyra, Malzahar, and even Mordekaiser\" which doesn't make sense.\n\n-Her win rates.  While these are a bit better than what they were at first on release (<40% until E was fixed) they are still hovering around ~46%. This is still not really a viable position, and maybe its partially due to more dedicated mains trying her than new players which help inflate it, but that's probably stretching it some tbh.  Its not where it should be in any case.\n\n-Skin changes/Visual Update- Some examples: The new model doesn't match up with her new splash (tail color, scale width, etc..). The Desperada skin lost the cooler tail design from before for a pretty plain brown one, and some preferred the old Desperada splash as well. She is less pretty- and it doesnt' fit the seductress theme as well. Her new icon reminds people of Wukong's icon...\n\n-Lore concerns- Her new lore is very short (a longer version may be hinted for release). She never seems to show her charisma/seducing qualities in the event (she just stabs Sivir). Why the snake trap? How does it protect what's inside? Isn't the curse (animal hybrid) something Shurima considered an ascedant quality? \n\n-And finally, Lack of Communication by Riot.   The changes were rushed through testing (like 2 days?) there was plenty of feedback which was never considered- including a bug on E which damaged her early release. Some feel there is a confirmation bias towards which replies were looked at (generally ones that liked the new direction). Wildly popular threads (nearly 300 on the old board) on her only get an early red response but then followed by silence, and are not pinned- leading to the feeling of being ignored. There has been little to nothing for her hitting public test (the only changes to date have been pretty minor- even though more had been promised to be in the works- its felt excruciatingly long for people waiting for these seeing new patches come and go with nothing)","replies":[{"poster":"Canastus","date":"2014-10-20T17:43:08.163+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fantastically written, you've hit the nail on the head. \n\nI did put a link to your post on the top of this thread, it deserves all the attention it can get.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"forgottenfables","date":"2014-10-19T18:59:43.472+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":8,"body":"Welcome to what Karma players dealt with.

Let's say you work at a restaurant. There's a customer sitting down, enjoying a lovely fruit parfait. It's delicious, it's presented beautifully and nobody has ever had any complaints regarding it.

The Karma example is one of how sometimes the overly vocal forum community can be wrong, because they don't represent the sentiment of the larger community.

Yes, there is a small similarity in the way in which a Riot employee interacted with the forum community, being dismissive and uncaring of the community's opinion.  I'm saying that in Karma's case, there was a good reason for that dismissiveness.  While you and other old Karma fans complained on the forums, Karma saw her pick rates rise, indicating that the larger playerbase was perfectly happy with Karma's rework.  It sucks that you liked old Karma more, but Riot wasn't wrong to change her, as evidenced by the greater playtime she has seen since.  Cass is different; the rework was rushed to match the Shurima events and it made her weaker overall when the stated goal was to make her weaker early and stronger late.  Her pick rates weren't great before the rework, but now her pick rates and win rates are falling to horrific lows.

Cass is a cool champion, she has fun abilities, neat theme, really cool skins, everything: she's awesome, and she deserves to be played. There are obviously problems with her weak early game and not having the tools to make it to the late game. Stashu himself admitted as much. But acting all self-entitled isn't going to get us anywhere. Demanding answers isn't going to find a good fix for Cass any sooner; I'd much rather they spend their time actually working out those changes rather than vaguely talking about them. \n\nThe thread you reference [(the Stashu thread here)](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/gFME3v51-on-the-future-of-cassiopeia-also-some-background) explains everything we need to know right now. In it, Stashu says:\n\n> the primary reason why we had no changes for 4.18 is that we still haven't fully determined which tools to add to/bolster on Cassiopeia's kit. We know that we can buff her stats to a point where she's strong, but we're spending some extra time to ensure that our changes do everything we want them to (namely, reinforce her Snake Mage identity). \n\nThis is the exact answer most of us were hoping to hear. He mentions how resources are tight because of all the Pre-Season changes incoming, and then he says:\n\n>That said, I plan on getting some Cassiopeia changes into testing with the target of finalizing them by the next patch or two. \n\nSo there, we have an ETA *and* confirmation that they are indeed looking at Cassiopeia. Anything further is just going to be a useless, repetitive \"we're working on it\" post until they have the actual change, in which case we'll know right away.   \n\nAlso, everyone, enough with the crying Cassiopeia pictures. She's way to cunning to let something like this bother her. :P","replies":[{"poster":"Grand Eleven","date":"2014-10-21T20:55:10.305+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> \n> So there, we have an ETA *and* confirmation that they are indeed looking at Cassiopeia.

As someone else pointed out she had two identities before:  late game carry (Tons of damage!) and DOT mage (which made her a heavy harass champion).  They ripped out one of her identities claiming it overlapped with champions like Brand.  This is unsettling on a number of levels:\n\n1.  Of the two potential identities to take away ... why would you take poison/dot away from a snake mage and keep the hyper/carry aspect?  Thematically alone .... **WAT?**.  How does snake/poison say hyper-carry more than DOT?\n\n2.  Further on the DOT removal, the list of champions whom's identity it apparently fringed upon were clearly not DOT champions ... something easily observable by ... uh ... everyone in the thread.  Brand is a DOT champion?  Really?\n\n3.  Then there are DOTs themselves .... had anyone heard they were toxic before that answer was ponied up as a reason it was pulled from her kit?  Are there any threads in GD on this?  Teemo shrooms are legendary I guess ... but yet they persist... and I doubt it's the DOT aspect that makes them infuriating.\n\n4.  Third is the ugly M word:  meta.  The mage hyper-carry has no place in today's meta.  At all.  People were upset that it was announced that Cass would be re-tuned into a role that doesn't exist. \n\n5.  Finally there's flexibility:  why is it bad that Cass can build for multiple roles?  Why did she have to be streamlined at all?\n\n\nPut all this together and yeah:  lot's of people aren't so thrilled that this change came about ... and buffing numbers addresses NONE of those 4 concerns listed.  Now it sounds like they are trying to make it \"feel\" like poison is involved while not making her DOT based anymore ... but is that really a fix?  At all?\n\nTo me no.  I dont like the DOT removal from her kit.  It was part of her identity.\nJust like I dont like that they striped all reference to her being beautiful.  (notice Shurima event pulled all references to her being beautiful?)\nOr they stripped the rattlesnake from her desperada skin.\n\nReally the ONLY thing I've liked from this sea of change was her default splash art ...

These arn't numbers... these are player responses ... feelings.  If Riot designers were basing this on closed testing then the debate was little more than academic:  you can pretend to know how the player base will feel ... but do you really know if it never gets pushed into the PBE?  On that note ... can you name a DOT champ right now as a point of contention?  Honestly the only poison/dot champs I can really think of are Teemo and Singed.  Do we see threads about their power level being too low?  I certainly don't.\n\nWas it stipulated by looking at Cass's low pickrate?  If so:  why is that a problem?  They've stated repeatedly that it's ok to have a champion with a niche popularity as long it was unique and viable.  \n> Furthermore, burst is always going to be more desirable than DOT; it happens instantly, and is easier to judge exactly how much damage you(or the enemy) is going to do.

DOTs are in plenty of games I can think of.\n\nI honestly just don't get it.  I don't understand _where_ this comes from.  Not everyone likes DOTs ... so what?  Not everyone likes playing spell casters.  Not everyone likes bruisers ... it's just not a basis to remove a mechanic IMO ... especially in a game that would benefit from mechanical depth.\n\n> \n> I think striping her beauty references was a bad play, but that has nothing to do with game balance and Stashu probably has little to no control over it.\n> \n> Desperada still has a rattle and its clearly still a rattlesnake motif.

Problem with the desparada skin is that she was a \"wild west\" theme skin ... aka western diamondback rattler.  The diamondback pattern in her tail is gone.  It's not a major issue ... but no:  I don't like it.  You put together a lot of little things you dont like ... suddenly you start to dislike.\n\nI dislike the \"new Cassiopeia\".  A long (long) time ago she wasmy favorite mage that I tabled as I decided i love playing bruisers ... I was hopeful with the announced Cass changes that maybe I'd pick her backup ... I played her dedicated for a week ... and simply dislike almost everything they changed about her.  Rather than bumping her up they made her worse both in raw power as well as thematically.
