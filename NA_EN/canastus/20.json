I&#039;d like to know why an overly mobile champion with great assassination potential is allowed to stay at such a high winrate throught the entire season without ever getting looked at. Her pickrate ain&#039;t too shabby, either. **No matter how many casuals pick her up, she continues to perform in an overwhelming fashion**. Don&#039;t you think there might be something problematic about that?\n\nAhri is the most popular ap midlaner in the game, and that for a good reason. **Her gameplay leaves little risk for her while offering huge rewards once she lands one of her skillshots**, all thanks to the extremely generous safety nets you&#039;ve given her (her sheer mobility) which makes it almost impossible to even gank her in lane. She also gets free movespeed for merely casting one of her abilities without having to hit her target(s) unlike certain other champions ({{champion:69}}).\n\n**The last nerf to her sustain didn&#039;t do anything to reduce her effectiveness, she remains as strong as ever.** So why haven&#039;t you considered any real changes to her gameplay yet? Could this be due to the recent release of yet another Ahri skin or do you simply fear upsetting her playerbase? Please respond.","replies":[{"poster":"Only Play Darius","date":"2015-09-08T21:37:17.063+0000","up_votes":29,"down_votes":3,"body":"Because she isn't outright toxic to play against.

Many midlaners can poke with 2+ abilities and combo, while Ahri only has an easy to dodge skillshot. Not to mention she is easy to harass out of lane. She has no kill pressure before lvl 6, and even when she does get her ult it is still quite easy to dodge her skillshots. I don't quite understand why people join the Ahri hate train.

If she was building Athene's it would be believable.\n\nAthene's has the same amount of base mana regen and CDR, 2% missing per 5, and 30% mana back if she gets a kill or assist. Plus a nice little bit of MR to help. With a difference of 20 AP and 400 gold.\n\nAhri's mana regen without Morello's: 6 - 19.6 (Lvl 1-18) Ahri's mana regen with Morello's: 12 - 39.2 (Lvl 1-18) Ahri's mana regen with Morello's and Doran's: 15 - 42.2 per 5.\n\nThis means that at lvl 18, Morello's gives 10.8 too little per 5 for her foxfires which cost 50 mana (Which are on a 5 second CD at level 5) And with Doran's the mana regen still isn't enough.\n\nAhri's base mana pool: 334 – 1184\n\nUnless she buys more mana regen items other than Morello, builds flat mana or Athene's, she'll run out of mana rather quickly if she tries to spam poke at you.\n\nOrb Costs: 65 / 70 / 75 / 80 / 85 (7S CD)\n\nFoxfires Cost: 50 (9/8/7/6/5S CD)\n\nCharm Cos: 85 (12S CD)\n\nFoxy-triple-dash-whatever-it's-called Cost: 100 (110/95/80S CD)\n\nMorello's doesn't cut it for the mana needed to sustain, so it means she's getting a lot of mana from elsewhere. And she is. CS. 4 mana per minion may not seem like much, but it stacks up fast when added to her mana regen. That's a potential 24 mana per cannon-less wave, 28 if cannon is included.\n\nThough that 24 - 28 isn't much in the late game, it the early to mid it means a lot. She's getting gold and the mana needed to poke you, by CSing. So to counterplay her, deny her as much CS as possible and punish all attempts at CSing to the best of your ability.\n\nWhile this doesn't fix her being a little bit too safe, and I agree that she should get her MS boost from hitting people with her abilities instead of from just casting, it makes things a lot easier to deal with in lane.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tomatosx","date":"2015-09-09T07:41:36.109+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":4,"body":"Because you don't know how to pick {{champion:50}}  or {{champion:1}}  doesn't mean a champ should be nerfed.","replies":[{"poster":"SaltyKracka","date":"2015-09-09T07:49:26.858+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=YellowTomato12,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=aQREbWfK,comment-id=0015,timestamp=2015-09-09T07:41:36.109+0000)\n>\n> Herp derp y dun u counterpick her herp derp\n\nGreat idea!
