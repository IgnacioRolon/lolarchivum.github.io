In his current state he&#039;s literally just an ult-bot, and even that ability comes with a huge price - usually the loss of his tower the moment he leaves lane to help someone. And don&#039;t get me started on his complete lack of waveclear, he&#039;s just extremely dull to play as.\r\n\r\nWasn&#039;t your original plan to give him some more laning power while increasing the cooldown of his ultimate? He&#039;s already a very weak solo-laner (just look at his Solo Q performance) and yet you feel inclined to balance the game for an extreme minority that apparently knows how to make this sad excuse for a ninja work.\r\n\r\nHow about you finally fix his taunt-hitbox?

As a low ELO player with almost 300k on Shen, repeatedly hitting his lane power really started to hurt. Why play a high skill floor champion for mediocre results when I could just Yorick and win on CS alone? \n\nTo suggest/note a few things:\n- Giving recipient-side enemies a way to combat his ult would probably be one of the most effective ways to just kill him in pro play, but keep him functional in soloQ. i.e. the ult gets canceled when the shield breaks, not just when the recipient dies. A more narrower but more reliable interrupt condition (like it breaks when charmed or feared) would probably be a more nuanced way to do it, since it makes counter-picking Shen in competitive a more legitimate strategy. \n- I hate his W from a game health perspective. It's absurdly powerful vs auto attackers and worthless vs abilities (can't be helping the competitive marksmen situation). I'd prefer a more consistent defensive skill with actual scalings, if only so I could blind pick Shen more consistently.     \n- I think incentivizing CDR more would be a good way to reduce his consistent power in pro play, while making his amateur play a little more impactful/fun (basically reducing ult uptime and increasing core kit uptime). \n- Shen's got maybe the most limited (competitive) itemization in the game. Broadening the items he can meaningfully pick would help make his balancing less volatile/painful.\n\nI'd love to see the shyvanna-scale rework team give him a once over. I don't think he needs a full rework, but he definitely needs some actual dev time, vs \"High pick rate in competitive, so nerf him again\".

Yeah who gives a fuck about his late game dueling power? I'm sure no one wanted to have a chance of dueling a Yasuo or Riven past laning phase. It's not like those champions are popular in solo queue in all levels of play while being very rare in competitive. I'm also sure they'd much prefer being much less durable in team fights since their main tank steroid is being hit hard late game. No, Shen players would much rather lose something like that than lose a bit of his global omnipresence which is what lets him dominate pro play.

Shen's survivability comes from his passive and his W. You're gutting the former after level nine.\n\n> At the same time, our PBE changes are a slight buff to his early laning, not a large one but it definitely can be meaningful in extended trades in the early game.\n\nNow if only you hadn't already gutted his Q damage, then that might matter. And I'm sure being slightly better at laning will make up for the large decrease in mid to late game dueling and team fighting durability.\n\n> Historically, Shen has been strategically countered by a late game duelist who could lane against him throughout the game. The nerfs on PBE are intended to push him slightly more towards that historical weakness.\n\nName a single late game duelist top lane other than Camille or Fiora that is picked or banned often in competitive. \n\nAnd are these champions having a great deal of trouble dealing with Shen personally in lane in the early or late game? I find that hard to believe, considering Camille and especially Fiora shit on Shen personally as the game goes on. Are you sure it isn't just that they have trouble keeping up with his insane global presence? Huh... it's almost like you should nerf that, because it would impact Shen players in solo queue far less (since they aren't coordinated with their team and can't rely on them to play smart in a way that won't make ulting in suicidal). Or maybe you're trying to open top lane up for more late game duelists? Is that it? You trying to open top lane up for the hot Tryndamere in the LCS bud? Shen's ultra powerful late game dueling keeping Tryndamere out of top lane? \n\nNo, sorry, but this is all bullshit. Shen is already weak late game to powerful duelist divers, skirmishers, or juggernauts. You're doing the same dumb shit you guys did before. You're nerfing an area where Shen is already weak or mediocre instead of focusing on what's actually making him a huge pick in professional play (which makes him binary btw, he can either win the game with the use of his ultimate that's taking up so much of his power budget or he can't and he loses). And after you destroyed his Q Shen was a piece of dog shit in solo queue but hey! At least he wasn't dominating pro play right? Because that's what matters. You don't want Shen to be a popular pick top lane in professional play because when he is it's boring.

Historically, Shen has been strategically countered by a late game duelist who could lane against him throughout the game. The nerfs on PBE are intended to push him slightly more towards that historical weakness.\n\nwhy did you nerf darius then? darius had a fair winrate in solo queue. why not make him viable in pro play? or you know only ahri and mid lane mages are allowed to have 54% winrates?\n\nwhy not make champions that counter top lane tanks that aren't fiora viable? can you please answer this question wave because it haunts me every day","replies":[{"poster":"SaltyKracka","date":"2017-03-12T07:19:53.290+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"They nerfed Darius because he was OP.\n\nAnd hey, surprise surprise, he bounced back.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Clementine","date":"2017-03-12T07:18:09.181+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"Or you could stop balancing the game around pro play","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jeddy017","date":"2017-03-12T14:10:16.309+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, any nerf to his ult will affect normal & pro play. But it would allow you to give him compensation buffs in other parts of his kit. The ult is draining so much power out his kit that he's just an ult bot now. Removing power their allows you to put power elsewhere. \n\nThough, you guys should probably just rework his ult or rework how it works. It's the cause of Shen's problematic history even after his rework. If I recall correctly, the rework was done to target how uninteractive his laning was or something. Maybe you guys should have change the ult too because right now, he has the same issue as Azir, Kalista, Rek'sai because of his ult. Constantly picked & nerfed because of pro play & made worse for the rest of us.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"fuffychan","date":"2017-03-11T01:12:20.790+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"Whats a Shen?","replies":[{"poster":"Canastus","date":"2017-03-11T01:12:55.313+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"**Exactly.**","replies":[{"poster":"fuffychan","date":"2017-03-11T01:20:01.701+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":2,"body":"On a serious note I actually enjoyed playing him back in the day with his Vorpal Blade Q.
