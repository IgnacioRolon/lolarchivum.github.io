The average game lasts 25 minutes now with most games already being decided after 15 minutes, that&#039;s the kind of meta we&#039;re dealing with.\r\n\r\n**I&#039;m aware of the buffs on the PBE for her (increased E-scaling), however they&#039;re not the solution to her problems.** She&#039;ll be stuck getting 3 mana-items before building any actual damage and games are already decided after that. Right now, Cassie is sitting at a 45% winrate on diamond level and above, and she&#039;s undescribably bad below that. At the same time there are 20 other champions who are within the range of a 55% winrate and don&#039;t seem to get any nerfs at all which isn&#039;t very nice.\r\n\r\n**There are some ideas I&#039;d like to bring up on how to approach this snake problem.** First of all, an update to her passive has become absolutely mandatory. It&#039;s unacceptable that she&#039;s omitted from getting flat mpen while every other mage in the game can deal true damage to their lane opponent from getting a simple pair of boots. Meanwhile that 6th item-slot of hers serves no purpose as long as she&#039;ll never reach that full build state. It feels like an extreme handicap and not a strength, I&#039;d gladly trade it in for something else.\r\n\r\n**The least Cass deserves would be a secondary passive that gives her one point of mpen for every level she acquires** (thus arriving at 18 mpen like everyone else). She&#039;d also need her basedamage nerfs reverted since she won&#039;t be making any use from increased E-scaling due to being forced to rush 3 mana-items just to function, this leaves her with very little AP to begin with.\r\n\r\n**Now if you truly care about her balancing, you should strive for a final rework.** However this time get rid of her Twin Fang ability, it&#039;s literally the source of ALL her balancing issues. Having a low cd point and click ability as your main source of damage is a terrible design, she&#039;d be far better off by relying on skillshots entirely as long as she gets some of her power back. \r\n\r\n**Turning her into a proper poison mage would easily be the most healthy approach if you&#039;re looking for a long-term solution.**\r\n\r\nhttps://i.imgur.com/nK0tkeg.png","replies":[{"poster":"Penns","date":"2017-12-10T19:59:54.036+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":">3 mana items\n\nwith all 3 of them giving high AP unless you go Abyssal lel","replies":[{"poster":"Canastus","date":"2017-12-10T20:31:49.505+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"You usually get a Tear and Catalyst first which give you zero AP on their own, then you finish RoA which will be done usually at the 15 minute mark.

First off, nearly all midlane mages outrange her. You can just abuse this and poke her while staying out of range. She runs out of mana extremely quick while spamming E, early game she may even go oom before killing you. The damage is reduced a lot if you dodge her q. Additionally, she's forced to build mana items and unable to get the flat pen which gives the highest damage output for AP.\n\nAzir outclasses her in pretty much every way possible right now. She is not strong.","replies":[{"poster":"T4underbolt","date":"2017-12-11T12:46:14.600+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"You have a really bad understanding of outranging her.

She can just use w that literally cant be missed, slows and makes you unable to flash or use any mobity spell while spamming empowered e on you. \n\nAzir is obnoxious with his range anyway.

Literally just use your spells and walk away if she tries to go aggro! Playing Ori for example, you QWE so she's slowed and can't chase. Guess what, you can do that to poke as well! Outside her range! I don't see the problem here. As a mage you want to be the one zoning her, not the other way around. you have burst damage to win quick trades, she doesn't. \n\nWith your logic basically all midlaners are broken. You can't just overlook their weaknesses and say they are overpowered. Cassio clearly has more weaknesses than many other mid champs.","replies":[{"poster":"T4underbolt","date":"2017-12-12T02:27:57.151+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Leblanc with silence had the lowest wi rate of 45 % in the game but she was toxic and the most broken champ.

Wow, your lack of game knowledge is amazing.\n\nBtw, when you slow Cassio you are already outside her range or walk out of it before she has time to react. Most of the time, you are not letting her W or Q you in the first place as a mage.

Orianna has no flaws. You can barely farm if you are not lux or xerath. She zones you with her ball and spams q with no mana costs. One qwe combo on lvl 3 takes nearly half hp and as i mentioned has no cooldown so its basically a spammable nuke not a poke. Not to mention her w has same ratio and base dmg almost the same as ult. Nice to have aoe ability with ult level of dmg on basic ability with no cooldown. Additionally they just had to make it even easier to farm and trade with autos so she also outtrades ad champs. Bo us resistances, ms. Shielding allies. She is always good with any teamcomp and never was out of meta.

Every champ I've mentioned is broken according to you.\n\nOrianna is a jack of all trades and overall a safe pick. However assassins, Syndra, Annie bursts better, Azir, Cassio, Ryze etc dps better and TF/Taliyah roams and pressure better. Orianna is a high skill cap champion due to all the interactions with the ball. She is also outranged by many midlane champions.

Azir has a pretty safe lane due to his E, that does not mean he has a low skillcap. Also, I think you are mixing skill floor with skill cap. It may be easy to make the champions decently effective, but teamfighting optimally with them isn't easy. \n\nTaliyah is also way stronger than Cass, for both soloq and pro play. She has solid damage and extremely good roaming with R, and also very good waveclear and solid DPS in addition to a oneshot-combo. \n\nYou have to look at champions compared to the rest of them. Azir being viable makes Cass weak by itself, since he's basically a stronger version of her.","replies":[{"poster":"T4underbolt","date":"2017-12-13T18:52:32.736+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes I actually meant skill floor. My bad on that part. But you have to understand that such a stupidly strong laning phase that gives you huge advantage since lvl 1 or lvl 2 leads to easy snowball which means in return you get many items before everyone and you have so much damage you can just stand in place and attack cause you nuke everyone and you still have 4 other people. Your jungler cant be there and camp mid everytime cancer like cass or azir are in game to get free advantage. I had never find taliyah to be that strong. She has roams but her laning is not giving her free cheese and zoning. Even as meele you can manage vs her mainly because of skillshots. Meanwhile both cass and azir are basically point and click champions with most power in that point and click abilities. I never seen any Taliyah oneshoting anyone unless she had like 7 kills in 10 minutes.","replies":[{"poster":"SB Arneeman","date":"2017-12-15T11:05:10.100+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In lane, you don't need to fight Cassio. You don't need to trade with Cassio. You poke and waveclear from safe distance with the superior range of pretty much every mage. If she gets low(or if you can oneshot her, playing something like Syndra or Annie) you can kill her since she lacks burst.\n\nCassio has a big weakness: she lacks both burst and mobility. With the 4 other people on your team, you should be able to burst her down pretty quick, just like you play against an adc. Even though the DPS numbers scale well, lategame basically all squishies kill each others nearly instantly and then the lack of high range, burst and mobility is a big problem.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"hoyohai","date":"2017-12-13T00:55:29.619+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ryze dps's better?\n\nEdit: Oh.

I miss it. For those of you who don't know, back before 2014 when they first reworked her with the Shurima event(and utterly butchered her), her passive was Deadly Cadence. For a few seconds after casting a spell, her next spell will have it's mana cost reduced by a percentage, and it stacked up to 5 times. This helped her with the spammable spell fantasy, because it helped to mitigate her mana. It was oppressive before because her poisons were incredibly strong and it made her oppressive. However, now that her newest rework has balanced out her poisons and her E, I think Deadly Cadence could return and help her out with her mana issues.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Teridax68","date":"2017-12-11T15:35:08.875+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I largely agree with this assessment and its conclusion. I'm not the most experienced at playing Cassiopeia, but I agree that her Twin Fang feels like the source of many of her problems: it doesn't really provide any unique gameplay of its own, so much as punish Cass's opponents extra hard for getting caught in her Q or W. Additionally, while Cassiopeia is balanced around being a late-game champion, Twin Fang gives her a lot of bullying power in lane, as outside of its mana constraints its only limitation comes from Cass's ability to chase her target, typically only the tower or minion wave while in lane. I imagine many players may be attached to it due to how it's been a core part of her kit for so long, but at the end of the day it's a DPS pump with no real gameplay or interaction of its own.\n\nI also agree that Cass is the champion with the greatest potential for being a poison mage, yet that potential has remained untapped for a very long time. Currently, she's kind of midway between being a poison mage and an AP pseudo-marksman, and neither playstyle gels exceptionally well with the other. In addition to this, her passive is a non-mechanic, wasting a slot for what could be an additional source of gameplay for her and her targets. Looking at her current kit, Cass is already able to apply a host of negative effects on her victims, such as damage over time, a slow/ground, and even a stun, so it really is a matter of structuring her kit in a way that makes her choose what kind of harm she wants to apply to her target, and thereby become a proper poison mage.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Phazanor ","date":"2017-12-11T04:44:20.282+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Having a low cd point and click ability as your main source of damage is a terrible design, \"  \nYou mean an ADC?","replies":[{"poster":"Canastus","date":"2017-12-11T15:32:58.541+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Marksmen are inherently toxic by design due to the fact that they can be played in any lane (or even the jungle), they're simply that good.
