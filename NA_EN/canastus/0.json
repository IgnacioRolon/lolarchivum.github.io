The limitation of pink wards and their blatant visibility have crippled counter-mechanics against those champions severely.\n\nAs a midlaner it's impossible to ward both sides of your lane with pinks, neither can you secure vision in every single brush since you're restricted to having only one pink per champion. The sweeper-trinket is more or less useless against stealth-junglers since their ganks are extremely unpredictable. It gets even worse once said stealth champion is fed, from that moment on you're dead the second you encounter one.\n\nSo where's the counterplay which you value so much?

Teemo can place mushrooms a lot faster than you can. And unless you saw him place the mushroom, it's a guessing game. When you end a team fight and step on one of those land mines and survive with like 10 hp, it's a bit of a daunting task to determine where he might have hidden his shroom this time. You only get one guess, one shot. If you miss it, not only will you probably step on his other shroom, but you also lose the CD to do more important things such as disable wards. \n\nIf the cd was quicker on the red trinket it would help the shrooms, but you can't really do that without also changing the cool down of the yellow trinket, otherwise in a duo-bot lane, the person with the red-trinket(if only one bought them which is pretty common for early game) will have mad ward control over the other. That being said, I think this is something A LOT of people forget... you can upgrade trinkets. It doesn't help anywhere near to enough to handle the fungus problem, but it helps.\n\nHell, reading the Sweeping Lens it aparently summons a small drone to scan the area. Why not make the effect the same, but apply around you in a circle just like oracles, but no where near as long? With it having a cool-down, I don't think it would a problem at all if it only lasted like the 6 seconds that it does.

I don't think the op is asking for that to change, they just want oracle's elixir back. \n\nOracles was a good item it had a time limit, and wasn't as direct a counter to invisible champs as pinks were. As it was, in most games only one person bought oracles and that was the support and that in no way majorly crippled any one stealth champ. \n\nThe problem now is the passive buff that riot has given stealth based champions {{champion:17}}  anyone?\n\nThe issue with sweepers is that they don't last long enough to take out more than one ward or a couple of shrooms at best with the upgrade. Without oracles, a lot of teams are at the complete mercy of any stealth champ. If elixir was brought back, I don't forsee more than the support or maybe mid, buying it on a regular basis, which in all honesty won't hurt stealth mains too bad, and will give people a way to counter what has become a very frustrating issue.","replies":[{"poster":"Gorbache","date":"2014-03-07T02:05:13.616+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"They reduced mushroom damage to compensate for the fact that you'll get hit more than before\n \nOracle does what I said though, it makes stealth completely useless in the enemy team.","replies":[{"poster":"Zalkreai","date":"2014-03-08T01:12:36.845+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I disagree, oracles does not make stealth completely useless, it allows for effective counter play.\n\nTake Evelyn for example, she has a range on her stealth that is *granted* slightly larger than the old oracles range, yet it doesn't ruin her ganking effectiveness or otherwise stealthy qualities. Getting oracles back in the old days was effectively adding Eve's sight range to other champions. \n\nThat being said, oracles sight range was still relatively small, about the same size as a basic sweeping trinket, and did not cripple any stealth champ, just made assignations a bit more tricky. \n\nMaybe there can be a compromise here, like allowing the oracles effect on an upgraded trinket last a little longer, for more shroom sweeping effectiveness, and also allowing for a little more security against an enemy that you can't see.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"exec3","date":"2014-03-07T08:08:16.855+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"To me Oracle's felt like a crutch to justify broken stealth mechanics and a broken ward system.

It seems to have been created with the mindset of clearing wards rather than being effective against all other invisible things on the map. The Red Trinket does its intended job effectively, it is good at clearing out a ward or two in a valuable area without being able to seek out and destroy every ward on the map like Oracles Elixir used to.\n\nNow that Shacos, Teemo shrooms, large cats and smelly rats have domain over the rift, the Red Trinket just isn't able to deal with them effectively.\n\nI've been thinking of a new Oracles-esque item, and while I can't come up with a creative name, (Oracles tonic? I'm bad at this) duration, or a price for it here's my idea on its function:\n\n* Grants vision of nearby invisible enemy traps and champions\n* DOES NOT grant vision of nearby enemy sight wards\n\nI don't know if this has already been talked about, but personally I'd spend some extra gold to see that Shaco that just avoided death with his Q, or the Rengar that might just be sneaking to the back lines.

The changes I would make would be....\n\n- reduce green wards per champ to 2x\n\n- give green wards a small \"see invis\" radius of about 25%\n\n  + so it can see stealth champs, but only if they pass very close to it\n\n- increase health of pinks to 8 hits, and expand range by 25%\n  + need more options to defend them\n\n- introduce additional vision items (Lightbringer) and invent \"fogging\" items\n\nI've always felt that the vision and stealth part of matches should have plenty more options for tactical decisions beyond champion picks and standard wards but also in form of itemization.  \n\nNiche champion design and current champion redesign/tweaking could help as well.\n\n*edit* - I do like trinkets as well.

Stealth was absolutely useless when Oracle's was around in any major capacity. \n\nYour concerns are also pretty easy to work around. Stealth junglers fall off much harder than a lot of their counterparts, and stealth warding a fringe camp will help you keep an eye on them to gauge risk of being ganked. \n\nSweeper is excellent, especially with the upgrade. There can't be any confusion here. It's an investment that can help suppress an enemy stealth champion's advantage. It protects against the two trap champions and gives you a reveal for stealth assassin players for a healthy portion of time.\n\nIt sounds like you've been camped and that's frustrating you.
