(Still, I&#039;d greatly appreciate it if you&#039;d take your time to read the long version, it has plenty of interesting points.)\n\n**If the majority of (popular) midlaners are already counterpicks to her, when is it ever okay to pick Cass in a Solo Q environment?** From a statistical viewpoint, her pick- and winrate have reached new lows, such as 2% and 44% respectively. This has been an ongoing issue for months already and you even admitted how you&#039;re aware of her current problems along with the strong dislike for her rework. So why aren&#039;t you taking any action? [Well, let&#039;s look at RiotRepertoir&#039;s post for a second there.](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/L0msce7E-riotrepertoir?comment=0000)\n\n> \"**Cass isn&#039;t currently a scheduled project due to us wrapping up the season and preparing for the next.** This isn&#039;t to say someone can&#039;t get some ideas rolling on her, but we do have to be respectful of the current stuff planned. I think the good news for Cass is that I really think she doesn&#039;t need a ton of change to help out in most of the main areas where old Cass mains would be happiest.\"\n\nThis has to be most questionable response I&#039;ve seen from a red regarding this topic yet. **So your main argument is that you&#039;re pretty much afraid of any drastic changes before Worlds is happening?** At the same time you release major changes to several OTHER champions (see the last 2 patches) while going as far as to introduce a semi-rework for \"juggernauts\". That&#039;s pretty huge if you ask me. Your argument doesn&#039;t really stand if you already contradict yourself with your very own actions.\n\n**It&#039;s almost as if we&#039;ve gone full circle since her rework came out**, we&#039;re back to having an extremely questionable and underperforming champion who defies every expectation of her playerbase (what happened to that poison mage identity of hers?) while being widely inaccessible to everyone else.

Dropping current projects just to please a player base can bite you in the butt if you're not careful.  We've also got to consider that the player base for Cass is wanting something that is a very touchy subject.  A poison based mage, that is a dot based mage, can be highly toxic to play against (See {{champion:17}} ) and requires a LOT of forethought.  For what it's worth, her current kit does a fair job of living that dream (Not great, but fair.)  \n\nAbout the only way I can imagine her kit being more tuned for a poison based mage dream would be to extend the duration of her poisons a little, drop the damage on all of her basic abilities and have E buff the damage on her Q and W exponentially more than it does now.  In that way you can make her poisons deal exponentially more damage but requires you to keep poison and E stacks maxed on an enemy champ to deal maximum damage.  The damage is moved from E while preventing Cass from dropping a Q or W and walking away with a won trade thanks to her dot.","replies":[{"poster":"Champion Skin","date":"2015-08-26T07:59:29.160+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Teemo is toxic because he is incredibly hard to deal with from some melee champions\nBecause he is quick (his W) and hard to get to thanks to his (W + R) and even if you get to him he still has his blind if you are an auto attack reliant champion\n\nAlso his harass costs no mana as it is a passive ability...\n\nIn general... DoT's are just the same as instant abilities.... but weaker (if a DoT and instant ability does the same damage and such then the instant ability will almost always be better as the DoT gives the enemy time to react and use shields/healing and might survive thanks to HP regen and even if the DoT's will kill the enemy... it will still take some time and that might give the enemy enough time to turn around and kill you)","replies":[{"poster":"Kuroi86","date":"2015-08-26T08:29:40.024+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">In general...

I think Riot had the right idea with low base damage on Cassiopeia poisons while having her E amplify the damage, the problem is people see E spam as better than using it to stack more poison damage.  About the best way to fix this is to lower the damage on E but have it buff the damage on Q and W more while her passive can give more % AP on her Q and W.  The other alternative is to still lower E damage, but have it extend poison durations and/or lower the enemies magic resistance for as long as they are poisoned.","replies":[{"poster":"Solumindra","date":"2015-08-26T13:59:16.443+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or you can just rework her instead of trying to force a bad kit into something it was never intended to do.\n\nthe poison amp was added after the rework.
