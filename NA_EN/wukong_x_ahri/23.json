Honestly it still feels like challenged elo but at least we get  an extra reward this season :).\n\nPersonally the games feel a lot more chill overall, which is nice. Like we all still bad but at least a portion of players seem content with their rank so when getting stomped we just shut up and try our best rather than flame all game. Not everyone/every game is completely toxic free but it does seem better than silver/bronze and even some of the higher elos (according to reddit/boards), as far as toxicity goes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KGS Mystiq","date":"2016-10-31T19:16:26.370+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My gold experience earlier the season: Gold V easy, Gold IV easy, Gold III easy, Gold II okay, Gold I hell.\nAlso just dropped from plat 4 hope i can get it back until the ranked Season ends","replies":[]},{"poster":"Only Play Darius","date":"2016-10-31T03:13:16.736+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just got into my Gold promo, hoping I have the same luck","replies":[{"poster":"Wukong X Ahri","date":"2016-10-31T11:47:05.857+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good luck dude","replies":[]},{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2016-10-31T07:59:22.905+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good luck/how'd it go?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Niyumi","date":"2016-10-31T08:01:16.499+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Now that you're in gold, get ready for teammates worse than you ever had in bronze.","replies":[]}]}
