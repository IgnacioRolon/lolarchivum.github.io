If you consider all the retarded shenigans he's been thru, you'd think he would of already aged 5 years or even more, missed plenty of 'mandatory' school education, plus could likely be the only reason why it could be logically explained he is pulling mistakes like he gets amnesia after every episode, even back in the original seasons. Likely should of caught way more pokemon then he should already be at, use his entire roster of pokemon instead of dropping them all sides the mascot mouse, somehow loses pretty much every 'pokemon league he enters' because plot fk'ery, even his 'mascot mouse' should already be some powerhouse capped out monster yet loses to a starter that may of just been with a new trainer for less then a few days, yet he can blow up stronger pokemon with ease.\n\nAnyone remember how basically in the first set of episodes that electric rodent basically used \"Thunder\" [Stormy weather aside] (one of the best original electric moves) and nuked a swarm of spearow and a fearow? Weakness or not, you'd have to be pretty overpowered to pull that off when your basically a 'starter'.\n\nEnough of that rant though, i would agree Annie is not only in the 'old kind of champion spot', even if they gave tibbers a enrage effect. She's still in a good position to get a champion tune up to make her into something a little more useful and throw in a 'appearance progression' update like how Tarlic had his lore progress from his previous one into the version it is now, giving him a less of some silly crystal knight look and more of a 'gem power battle mage look.'\n\nWouldn't have to be serious if they ever decided to progress on it, add maybe a few years to make her look more like a middle schooler maybe, keep some of her charms of what makes her, her (because she ain't Annie without Tibbers~ ^^). But obviously don't turn her into some gothic trope, plenty of 'characters' end up with those silly schmicks. Course now im just reminded on how Ahri could also use a retooling of her kit and style since lore'wise she's just a fox who has life stealing powers where unless Annie has some crazy lore, i would assume she's just a little innocent but can basically seem like a demented little girl to others with pyro'kinesis powers.","replies":[{"poster":"SSJTribe","date":"2016-08-18T17:35:48.793+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"or this one ->\n\nIf \"The Simpsons'\"characters had aged in real time, Homer would be 62 years old, Marge 61, Bart 36, Lisa 34, Maggie 26, and Santa’s Little Helper would be 196 in dog years.","replies":[{"poster":"GetMariahCarried","date":"2016-08-18T21:19:48.822+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sheesh, Ekko, quit ulting.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Tattersall","date":"2016-08-19T04:10:43.561+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ash trained Pikachu through 13 seasons (that's 653 episodes).
