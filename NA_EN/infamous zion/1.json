I&#039;m coming back from a game where in the last team fight i got one shot from his 4th AA that dealt 2470 damage and i had around 2500 hp. As a mobility champ with 3 dashes, why am i not able to catch up to him with his insane movement speed and his AA hurts more than a full assassin legit. I feel like Jhin and few other adcs took over the assassin name","replies":[]}
