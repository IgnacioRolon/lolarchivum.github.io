I did not change any of my setings before the bug occured, but since than I uninstaled Lol once and reinstaled it, I also deleted the custom skin programm I am using since it caused bugs before and I tried out both clients but the bug happens in both. So if anyone can help me that would be lovely.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-05T22:02:14.760+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you using a 4k monitor or resolution higher than 1080?  Your resolution might simply be too big and can't be supported, so you'll have to stick to a smaller scaling.  You may need to reset your configuration folder to default which will then sync up on our side, which should then get your resolution back to default:\n\n **Log into the game** then hop into **a custom game**. *Alt+Tab* out of the match, then navigate to your League installation folder, which should be in C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\n\nDelete the folder named **Config**\n\nOnce you've deleted the folder, leave the custom match. You'll then want to hop into another custom match to confirm the changes were saved.\n\nKeep in mind you'll have to redo your bindings as a result.
