Also there was coding where our name&#039;s should be.\n\nIn game I actually had Rusty Blitzcrank (I do not own this skin as much as I wish I did lol).  I should have taken a screenshot; I&#039;m going to try to replicate it.\n\nWTH?\n\nUPDATE: here's a screenshot of me using Rusty Blitzcrank (I replicated the glitch by trading with my heimer duo again). I Don't own this skin.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/W012eJU.png","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-01-15T22:34:07.588+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Touched by Blitz,\n\nThanks for reporting this!
