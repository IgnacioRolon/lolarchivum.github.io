Why? What good does letting allies who didn't quite know when to back off steal XP they didn't mean to do?\n\nBecause duo jungle is a thing. And giving jungle creeps a different coding for exp sharing/range just to fix a 'newbie' problem seems...very clunky. People just need to learn to do their 2-3 hit and get to lane before they miss their 1st cs.\n\nEdit: Also, as jungler, I'd consider it more your responsibility to know when allies should leave than theirs. If they aren't jungling, then they may not jungle ever. And different jungles need different amount of leashing.\nI usually ping which camp I will start on with down/'assist me' ping before minions spawn. I only ask bot or top lane to leash, as mid will always miss at least 1 cs for leashing, so if I see mid going too far from mid after minions spawn, I tell mid they don't need to leash.\nAfter top/bot has given enough hits (depends on who I'm jungling and who they are) I vping, if they don't leave immediately and the creep is almost dead, I'll move away slightly/stop attacking so it won't die while they are in exp range. When they leave, I finish camp and say 'ty' in chat.\nNot hitting 2 is gonna hurt a LOT more than taking 1-2 extra hits from the camp to avoid the exp sharing.\nAnd unless you're eve or shyv going for a 4 camp 1st clear, 2 hits isn't going to be enough to get you killed unless you get invaded or you're on the wrong runes/masteries or don't know how to properly clear.\n\nIf worried about trolls intentionally stealing your 1st camp. Well, trolls will troll. If they're out to throw the game from before minions spawn, not like losing your 1st camp is gonna change much.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yandere Carry","date":"2015-02-27T10:37:34.104+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"teach them to c:","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Flemman","date":"2015-02-27T13:20:14.911+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"is it possbile that there is some bug with jungle xp in this patch?\n\nI play a nunu game yesterday and, despite doing the scuttle crab alone, it didn't gave me exp so I stay level 2 and couldn't invade safely the ennemi jungle for a quick steal :s","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yandere Carry","date":"2015-02-27T10:38:25.975+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you destroyed my friend in his placement matches ;-;","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Centuros","date":"2015-02-26T04:58:40.287+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"...do you get XP even if an ENEMY steals your monsters?","replies":[{"poster":"Drunk Rummate","date":"2015-02-26T14:55:27.859+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Centuros,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=sZWoKjFU,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-02-26T04:58:40.287+0000)\n>\n> ...do you get XP even if an ENEMY steals your monsters?\n\nnope. one of my favorite things to do with evelynn is stay outside of vision range and smite the enemy's gromp away just before they kill it.  you hit level 2 and they sit there sad and down a full potion. it's great!","replies":[{"poster":"PepSakdoek","date":"2015-02-27T10:18:23.878+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Eve needs a lvl 1 play to be viable :/\n\nNice thinking!","replies":[]}]}]}]}
