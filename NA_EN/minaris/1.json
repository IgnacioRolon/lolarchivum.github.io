But through all this time, Rito support has really helped this whole way. If anybody reads this, know that Riot support is probably one of the best support teams out there. My life has had deathly troubles though paypal, amazon, ebay, dell, apple, blizzard, and many others. But nobody does it quite as good as Rito. All in all, thanks rito for keeping my account safe, helping me with bugs, and stupid frame drops.
