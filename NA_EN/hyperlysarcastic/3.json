Yes, your own home internet is fine, but that doesn't mean you're going to have a top notch connection to every server in the world. Sometimes a network can just have a hard time getting a solid connection to specific servers, possibly due to how your ISP is routing your connection or some kind of local setting blocking you from making those connections. \n\nBased on what was happening to you, it makes me think that your network is having a hard time getting a solid connection with our servers if you can't get your champions locked in. Essentially what's happening there is this.....\n\n- You click on a champion and your client needs to send that data to the servers\n- For some reason, that data never hits our servers and your client is left wondering what it's supposed to do next\n- Your network never gets a response from the servers, since the servers never got any of your information, so the game thinks you never picked anything\n\nIn the long run, these issues are all very typically related to network problems. Again, it doesn't mean your internet is bad, it just means that we need to make a few adjustments to make it easier on your network.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
