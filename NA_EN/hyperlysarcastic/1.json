Then i re-open the launcher, login, click reconnect and it works fine.\n\nThis is the only way i can get it to work for me. I thought maybe it was something with my ISP but recently ive been having to use a VPN to route my traffic for every game as my ping went from 39ms to 480ms consistently with Time Warner Cable but goes back down to 39MS now with a VPN. But it still happens either way, even on my normal ISP connection or with the VPN Routing i still get this bug constantly.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-29T20:05:26.950+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"HyperlySarcastic","date":"2016-07-29T20:06:49.290+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Porocles,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=8sX9Awej,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-07-29T20:05:26.950+0000)\n>\n> It looks like your network is having trouble connecting to our servers, and resulting in the black screen you&#x27;re seeing.
