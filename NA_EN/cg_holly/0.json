And so far the changes from the PBE was a slight broken. But since it came out to the public I still have that feeling some of the stuff the patch added is still broken. The runes in 2017 made it balance because it was a choice of choosing your set. And be creative on what you want to create. Now we have this new system where its already made for you and you get little choices which some of the stuff is broken whether you look the other way. Even Doublelift said Triumph was broken. I know it takes alot of time to create something. But I've been with Runes alot more lol its hard to transition over to this new stuff.","replies":[{"poster":"SadKill","date":"2017-11-16T17:07:17.457+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't know what else to say other than.\n\nWelcome to preseason.

Most people are having a lot more fun with how interactive these runes can be, but there's a good chance something might be a little OP here or there. Since the system is still rather new, we're constantly looking for feedback and open to making adjustments. It'd be best to post those kinds of suggestions over in [**Gameplay **](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance)to make sure the Devs notice them!","replies":[]}]}
