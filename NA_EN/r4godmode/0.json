Yes they are strong with it, but once it on cd, they are more useless than a caster minion. Ence why Yi's ult duration resets on kills and assists and why Tryndamere is a bad teamfighter.

First of all because as we said, he's useless without his ult meaning him being tanky can help him dish out dmg without dying in a blink of an eye. Second, his e. Seriously, name one tank in the game that can ''dodge'' attack and spells like Fizz's e, you won't.

Both Wind Wall and Riposte make Yasuo and Fiora both stand still for a second, allowing me to do something whatever it's repositionning or casting an item, summoner. Playful Trickster make Fizz already on top of me/my adc.\n\n2. Both ability have a longer cd than Playful Trickter. Wind Wall is around 17 sec while Riposte is 13 sec at max level. Meanwhile, Playful Trickster is 9 cd and unlike the other 2, Fizz has a lot of cdr in his items ({{item:3100}} {{item:3165}} {{item:3102}} if ap), it can end up at like 6 sec.\n\n3. They are utility spells, meaning maxing them first is a very bad idea because you won't have any dmgs. Playful Trickster has utility AND damage with tiny cc (if you waited) meaning that Fizz doesn't lose any dmg by maxing it first or second.\n\n4. They can use it at best once per teamfight, meanwhile Fizz can use it at least twice.\n\n5. Both ability actually doesn't do anything if you don't fall for it or are not affected by them. Wind Wall only affect projectiles and can be countered by picking someone like Ali and Riposte doesn't last long. Playful Trickster can be use whatever Fizz feels like it, whatever it's for dodging something or not.","replies":[{"poster":"Atanchan","date":"2017-05-08T03:59:43.930+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Nymzo,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=eEAh010U,comment-id=00000000000000000000000000000001000000000000,timestamp=2017-05-08T03:18:00.764+0000)\n> \n> 1.

As an Ahri main, it breaks my heart to see them straying so far away from the badass \"Kiss of Death\" fantasy that suits her to a T. They've done EVERYTHING to avoid it, from removing the damage amp to even removing the ability to stop DASHES. Ahri's current iteration's playstyle is  just land a q or 2 in lane and then r in and spam q and w. Charm is completely out of the equation. I very rarely need charm to secure kills. Ahri's ult was  designed to land her charm and curve her q. Just make the charm a little more relevant, please. Assassin Ahri > Mage Ahri. At least when I killed someone as assassin ahri, I felt like i had outplayed the enemy and earned the kill.","replies":[{"poster":"Keevalroy","date":"2017-05-07T16:36:00.794+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"I agree.

It only came into existance when DFG became a thing, and they had to balance a mobile mage, into a mobile Assassin, who relied on DFG, for kills. Mage Ahri is much more healthier for the game, because getting hit by charm no longer means insta-death, not until Middle and late game. It gives room for outplaying early game, as it lengthens her kill time, so even if they get hit by charm, they can still respond. \n\nThe type of gameplay I see people wanting is like Syndra gameplay. You want to hit a target with your CC, and kill them before they can respond. That's all and well, but you can't have that on a Mobile mage early game, someone whose able to reposition, flank, and escape from tricky situations real fast. The only reason that existed during DFG times, is because they kept Ahri's bases low, forcing her to rely on hitting Charm and DFG, which lead to binary gameplay of \"Did I hit charm? No: Well now I'm useless\". \n\nOther mages, mobile or not, don't have to rely on hitting their CC to up the rest of their damage. It makes it easier to hit their combo, but not hitting a Xerath stun doesn't make his Q do less damage. That's the entire purpose of Ahri's charm, to make the rest of her damage more reliable, not do more damage. It allows a skilled Ahri to still kill someone, even if they miss their Charm, it just takes longer and forces the Ahri player to rely more on skill to hit both parts of Q without Charm helping them.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"NineTailedMystic","date":"2017-05-07T19:26:29.493+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":3,"body":"A rework is _completely_ unneeded.

It definitely would feel awkward for the Ahri player . How about reducing the movement speed she gets from it if she fails to hit an enemy champion instead of removing it entirely .
