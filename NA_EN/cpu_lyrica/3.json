I learn new champions in normal draft. Few people are helpful when it comes to helping you choose who to play in champ select. \n\nWhen people aren't having fun in a game anymore because they're doing bad, that's when people want to ff or give up. Some like to say \"gg\" after their team loses first blood. It's just their inexperience showing. They don't know how easily games can turn around with some gameplay alteration on their part. You have to pep talk them. Works for my teams, usually.\n\nPlay what you want in normals, but play what what you're good at in ranked games.","replies":[{"poster":"CPU Lyrica","date":"2017-12-17T07:37:28.381+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds good. until you go 2/12 to the enemy oriana because you wanted to try katarina mid, and the entire team, except the sejuani who quit at the start, begins flaming cuz ya wanna learn something new.","replies":[{"poster":"CamilleRule34","date":"2017-12-17T10:28:11.700+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=CPU Lyrica,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=F3f74f02,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2017-12-17T07:37:28.381+0000)\n>\n> Sounds good. until you go 2/12 to the enemy oriana because you wanted to try katarina mid, and the entire team, except the sejuani who quit at the start, begins flaming cuz ya wanna learn something new.\n\nGoing 2/12 as any champ isnt necessarily a mechanical issue, a lot of that has to do with decision making, contrary to my point a lot of decision making goes into knowing what your champ can or cannot do.\n\nThe best and safest way to learn how to play a champion is to watch some tutorials on them, then take them into practice tool, practice csing with them, practice their combos, and then hop into norms. You're gonna get your ass kicked, especially with assassins like kat who if you miss step ye done, but getting your ass kicked is how you learn. Watch the replay and then notice each time what killed you, and if the risk of you dying was worth it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Enna","date":"2017-12-17T15:52:48.073+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=CPU Lyrica,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=F3f74f02,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2017-12-17T07:37:28.381+0000)\n>\n> Sounds good. until you go 2/12 to the enemy oriana because you wanted to try katarina mid, and the entire team, except the sejuani who quit at the start, begins flaming cuz ya wanna learn something new.\n\nEven in blind pick people will talk crap. It's not right, but you can mute them if they start or in advance. I've used /mute all quite a bit when I'm trying something new in normals and don't feel like being tilted. I play worse when people flame, because I feel worse. So when I mute them, it's great because they can be flaming me and I'll still congratulate their victories.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"PhantomPrankster","date":"2017-12-17T21:54:25.424+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thats what you guys get for mocking people who didn't care about normals and just wanted to have fun. because this game is now plagued with tryhards who flame over everything. \n\nGG this community played itself","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mokuto Bunshi","date":"2017-12-17T21:48:51.762+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I learned to play {{champion:240}} for kind of the reverse reason.
