I just started playing league, I am level 37, and apparently I was doing pretty good in the unranked games because when I first played solo/duo ranked they put me in silver.\n\nI don't want to be in silver, because I played once and got raged at by teammates. It was deserved. I sucked.\n\nIs there any way for me to de-rank or drop into Iron without letting teammates down? I want to be in Iron because I just want to practice working my way up from the very bottom.\n\nI hear there is a ten-game shield to stop you from de-ranking an entire tier. I don't want to play ten silver losses just to get to where I belong.","replies":[{"poster":"Malix Farwin","date":"2020-02-17T11:02:24.384+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Sadly Silver is the base Elo they send/match new players in.","replies":[{"poster":"Sylaelque","date":"2020-02-17T12:05:17.073+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Malix Farwin,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=AFH4cIf7,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2020-02-17T11:02:24.384+0000)\n>\n> Sadly Silver is the base Elo they send/match new players in.\n\nNew players usually in Bronze and Iron ranks, just smurf accounts getting placed in the Silver.","replies":[{"poster":"Iljos","date":"2020-02-17T18:56:58.354+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"OP's rank is clearly not silver, its the MMR he plays at. you can go 10-0 in placements and barely get placed in silver while OP has a ranked record of 0-2.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Kai Guy","date":"2020-02-17T08:33:56.242+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Just play and Fail. Demotion protection Is pretty massive. You should expect to have to spend 50 to 100 games to really get a good feel for your skill.\n\nOn the Brightside if your really unable to play at all in a MMR, it will directly impact your WR and make the sink fairly fast.\n\nYour best off trying to win, trying to improve and muting the salt.\n\nIts  a skill curve and that means it takes time to sink just like it takes time to climb. Do not worrie for a second that your going to drag any 1 player down. Its just 1 of their games. for every 4 ya hamper 5 others profited. Net gain! (but seriously even in Elo which requires going back to 1960 the raiting system has a check and balance in place for standout individuals and will adjust the ratings of the folks you have encounter as a response to a dramatic sink or climb.\")\n\nYou never will stop the salt.  If your trying your best and actively looking to learn then its fine. Your likely better off... learning in normal or studying the game.... but eh do what makes you happy long as your not actively trying to ruin matches.\n\nYour also more then welcome to add me if you want some one who is not gonna flame you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Daddy Ants","date":"2020-02-18T10:57:24.976+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes but you need to lose a LOT of games in a row at a IV 0 LP rank to drop.\n\nIt's like 30 games in a row to drop from Silver.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Im Prismo","date":"2020-02-17T20:24:40.335+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is your name a DGD reference?","replies":[]},{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2020-02-17T16:45:58.284+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sadly, I don't think you have many options here.\n\nI'd suggest to just power through and play your games to the best of your ability. Mute people who flame you (and possibly report them). You'll get where you deserve sooner or later.\n\nAlso, to give you some better news: Rank doesn't matter for match-making, only the hidden MMR (literally Match-Making Rating), so the system will start matching you with and against Bronze players even while you're still officially in Silver. MMR moves and adapt quicker than Rank, and it's all that matter.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Clockwork Mouse","date":"2020-02-17T16:02:36.010+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Play {{champion:34}} and rank up wall and just spam that on your team mates.

You can be in SIlver with low Bronze MMR in which case you will be matched with and against Bronze players.
