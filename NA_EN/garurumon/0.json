Instead of the special drill he uses during overheat, it is featuring the regular non-overheat drill during this mode.\r\n\r\nPosting a couple of threads for further explanation:\r\n\r\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/8ukEpe6U-super-galaxy-rumble-overheat-drill-visual-bug?comment=00000000\r\n^Most recent one, which I&#039;m trying to highlight as it ACTUALLY isn&#039;t fixed yet.\r\n\r\nhttp://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=4846606&amp;page=1#post49846033\r\n^This one was commented by a Rioter in september last year, but it seems like it may have been forgotten or overlooked.\r\n\r\nSo I&#039;m hoping that we&#039;ll get some further explanation on what happened and what will happen.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-06-05T16:42:46.210+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Garurumon! \n\nI'm happy to report that we've found the root cause of the issue (which wasn't what we initially thought), and we believe we have a fix!

What a great thing! (also some attention for it was pretty neat), as it has sorta gone under the radar for a long time.\n\nI hope that I can speak for all of us when I say that it will make our Rumble plays more more clarified ;)","replies":[]}]}]}
