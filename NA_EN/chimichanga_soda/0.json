Have been having weird lag spikes ever since. I can chat during them, I can talk to my friend on Curse during them but for 20-50 seconds straight I just see minions swing at each other, I see people move around and HP levels change but no animations or actions until the spike subsides after 20-50 seconds. Obviously I can't play ranked until this crap is fixed.\r\n\r\nI've already done the DNS and port forwarding suggestions in the LOL support page. Can anyone help, please?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-21T17:09:57.255+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you're getting packet loss or some kind of connection issue.
