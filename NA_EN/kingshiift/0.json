If this IS a real email, i would like riot to check the IP connections to my account please. I will check my accounts match history to see if anything shady is going on.\n\nEDIT: Lo and behold there are alot of matches with high kills and low deaths. apparently there were 10 matches played with a guy named YolisHD so i'm guessing this guy's friend has hacked me. here's my NA.OP.GG profile as evidence. http://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=kingshiift","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-12T15:23:50.316+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I took a look into this for you, but due to the nature of sensitive account information we can't really share anything on the boards.

Literally none of these should apply to me. I  don't share my account and the last time I played was the event before the gp one. Can't even come up without how my account would be compromised. I wish I had access to the login times and dates and ip addresses. I am confused.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"KingSHIIFT","date":"2016-08-13T02:03:05.797+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I apologize, i fell asleep. \n\nI have sent a support ticket, and thank you in advance.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BlackDestruction","date":"2016-08-12T16:45:49.283+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I got the same thing.
