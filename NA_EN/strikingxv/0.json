He can start being a real threat just at lv 5 to 6, and if farmed well and itemization, you can out duel most champions. i would put him higher but its cause of his early game is bad and if nasus is fall behind with not good farm for q, he becomes quite useless till very later on in the game.\r\n4{{champion:24}}  ma boi. dodge basic attacks, lower aoe damage, ult makes you tanky, and empowered aa. with the right build in the right situation, hes scary to duel.\r\n5{{champion:23}}  late game he deals a lot of damage and life steal (depends on build) with his ult giving him a chance of finishing of enemies before he dies\r\n6{{champion:240}}  ive been playing him lately in pbe (i don&#039;t own him yet) and he is really fun. hes flexible, w doing a huge amount of damage, and for a skirmisher hes pretty tanky and mobile.\r\n7{{champion:39}}  (haven&#039;t played her but i see very good plays by her in dueling, has a lot of utility)\r\n8{{champion:48}}  against tanky fighters especially, i consider him as one of the best cause of his ult being able to heal you, and steal armor and resistance, essentially making him a high tanky fighter with good sustain and damage empowerment from his q\r\n9{{champion:50}}  him and vlad are the only mages i like to play (i dont play them alot though). swain is very good with strong cc and in built heal. for a battle mage, he has pretty good magic damage from his q. his ult will make him heal for a lot with a blast around him\r\n10{{champion:8}}  i dont play him much but i played him in pbe. grasp of undying with his passive and q, i find it a very good synergy because you can heal for a lot and do damage.\r\n\r\nas you can see i didnt add any marksman, support, tank, assassins and not that much mages which is because i dont own many characters and i dont play those roles as much, but feel free to add any champion from any roles, any item specification and any runes. (which includes non normal things too like ap leona dark harvest, ad braum electrocute, ap soraka , ad tahm kench grasp and etc) on your lists and feel free to make it as big of a list or a small list. im really curious to see what people have in mind.\r\n\r\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}
