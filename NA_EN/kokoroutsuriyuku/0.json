This wasnt a duplicate report. This was a report for a separate incident. The person was terrible in the game, yes. But this was a completely separate incident where they added me 10 mins after the game, after I had forgotten who they were, to talk trash and block me asap. So what I am taking from this is riot doesnt give a damn what people say outside of the confines of your match with them. Apparently if you dont like someone you can just add them a bit later and talk all the trash you want and riot wont do anything about it.\n\n..Removed by Moderation..","replies":[{"poster":"Evangele","date":"2019-06-01T02:43:25.945+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:267}} Hey OP,\n\nIve edited out your addition on your original post.
