I found this thread searching up my issue on google and since the author didn't respond I thought I'd show you my screen shot of the darker pool party zac. I was playing a team builder and when I loaded in I was dumbfounded at the dark color of the skin. (Unfortunately my print screen during that game ended up being a black screen, so instead I have a loaded up custom game.) Also here is an album link to a few more screen shots.  \n\nh ttp://imgur.com/a/Nn5CS\n \n(Because I can't get the hyperlink to work without making it a picture I broke the link up at the h)\n\nBIG IMPORTANT EDIT: I just changed my settings from Very Low to the highest settings with the slider (it seems to be character model, only at very low). This fixed the skin. I can't play on those graphics though so is this intended to happen?

Solid feel. *Wink Wink, Nudge Nudge*","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
