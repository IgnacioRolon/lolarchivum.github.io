But recently the people just crossed their lines because of an event?\r\n\r\n****Quitting the game because Riot won&#039;t let men into an event\r\nSaying community is punished bc &quot;men&quot; can&#039;t attend an event\r\nAngry over some rioters personal tweets and again blaming riot for that ****\r\n\r\nLeague of Legends which is a fantasy not reality game, has always been appealing to &quot;cis gender men&quot; by their &quot;bromance culture&quot; and &quot;sexualized female champs/skins in game&quot; ({{champion:103}} {{champion:84}} {{champion:28}} {{champion:60}} {{champion:164}} {{champion:51}} {{champion:69}} {{champion:145}} e.t.c)  but apparently that is not enough for them. Men have been a majority in every event of League of Legends. When women and lgbt people are being given an event where they can finally feel like they are &quot;majority and not some minority&quot;, people are crying? I am a man myself but I don&#039;t have any problems with that. I am still waiting for the patch where Trans, Gay, Lesbian e.t.c champ is released ( and not some stereotypical Media shown &quot;gay&quot;).\r\n The sad truth is that most of these &quot;keyboard warriors&quot; might not even go to the event or watch it online. When Riot is being open to women and Lgbt, these people are angry? Grow up, you cry/manbabies, instead of helping women and lgbt community , u r acting like dickheads and fighting for something which has always been yours.\r\nI am seriously done with these sensitive people and boards. This is really sad.{{item:3107}}","replies":[]}
