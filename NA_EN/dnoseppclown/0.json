So I alt tabbed to find a message that I had been banned and the client had closed. Now I know that a while ago I was going through a rough patch and was taking it out on the community but have since revised my behavior and have started climbing elo because of it (went from gold 5 to gold 1 within only a few days or so). I was excited to get to plat by the end of the season and now im not sure I'll be able to. I feel as though this ban was unwarranted and would love to hear what I did exactly. Thank you @lyte\n\n\nAccording to who ever responded to my support ticket I was exhibiting extreme cases of toxicity. I know for a fact that through the past month there have only been a handful of times that I have lost my cool while playing many MANY games. So, Unless this person was mistaken as to the reason and just hit ctrl+v to put the same response you do for anyone asking why they got banned I'm pretty upset at the moment. The email i receieved mentioned nothing of toxic behavior simply that my account was associated with violations of the TOS. @Lyte, I'd like some clarification","replies":[]}
