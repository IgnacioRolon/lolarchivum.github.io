Basically, so long as you aren't using one key to simulate or mimic multiple keypresses/independent actions, you are generally acceptable. Riot doesn't care what key you press so long as you're only gaining one action from that keypress.\n\nConsidering you're actually *decreasing* this to \"one keypress = zero actions\", you *should* be fine. That being said, third party programs are always at your own risk.","replies":[]}]}
