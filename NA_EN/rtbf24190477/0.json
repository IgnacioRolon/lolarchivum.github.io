But I got a little tired of league last year so I lent my profile to my friend (which is against TOS) but I trusted him, for the longest time he wouldn&#039;t tell me whats going on with my profile. At the beginning of last year&#039;s summer he gave it back to me only to see it permanently banned...\n\nEver since then my hopes for playing league ever again have died. I have written 2 support tickets to riot support, but to no avail they just tell me account sharing is bannable. And I understand that but isn&#039;t permanent ban a little extreme? To make matters worse I am in university now and my friends play league and I have to start all over again. Meanwhile some famous players have been unbanned even when they were perma banned. \n\nI would never repeat my mistake again if I was given a chance. But I&#039;ve lost hope by now my last hope is that I get some kind of help here, although it seems like I&#039;m begging. \nI just with I could get my old summoner name back and play on my real profile again.

Account sharing is against the ToU and is punishable by a permanent ban. You have the chance to not make the mistake again - on a new account.\n\nWe can't change Riot's policies. Next time, if you fall out of interest in a game, _don't give your account to someone who's interested. Keep it to yourself - if that friend or whomever else is interested in the game, they can make their own account._","replies":[{"poster":"rtbf24190477","date":"2018-12-17T16:04:54.498+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I guess you are right, it's completely my fault and there is nothing to be done about it.

Sorry.\n\n If you loved the account and played League for such a long time, you shouldn't have given it away knowing that it's against the TOS. Even if you didn't know that, there was just no reason to give your account away. \n\n The best thing I can say is that you should be able to join your friends quickly if you make a new account. You only need to be about level 17 to gain full access to rune pages and stat shards. The next milestone is only 30 for ranked.","replies":[{"poster":"rtbf24190477","date":"2018-12-17T16:06:29.185+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"If I am brutally honest I gave it to him because I was extremely addicted and ironically that got my account suspended thus freeing me of my addiction for awhile. ^^\n\nIt's good to know that making a second profile isn't bannable.","replies":[{"poster":"rujitra","date":"2018-12-17T17:25:05.647+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For full disclosure (in case someone else needs this information):\n\nIt *is* possible, but *exceedingly* rare, for Riot to issue an \"ID ban\" on a *person* or group.

Either story, you made a mistake, and you didn't feel like playing league anymore. If you want so bad you can start over, you're 7-8 years older than when you started league now, a few hundred dollars of skins should be a lot easier to afford.","replies":[{"poster":"rtbf24190477","date":"2018-12-17T18:30:35.354+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It does seem that way doesn't it?
