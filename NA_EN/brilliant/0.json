They will click the skip button because it requires less effort than considering who deserves an honour. While there is an easy option \nout, people will not honour. \n\n1. **Stats on honour screen**\nHave some stats displayed on the honor screen like _damage dealt to champions_, _crowd control score_, _vision score_, _damage taken_ and so \nforth.\n\n1. **Honour progression**\nMake the honour progression slightly faster. In today&#039;s world people have little patience and more inclined to want to see results sooner rather than later.\n\nJust my two cents worth, good luck :)","replies":[{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2017-07-06T19:12:15.321+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"1) Why should I be forced to honor someone if no one in my game deserved an honor?\n\n2) None of those things should matter for honor. It's about good sportsmanship, not game stats.\n\n3) They will learn to deal.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-07-06T13:29:24.474+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"1. do not remove the skip, because it's common that no one on your team deserves and honor.\n\n2. agreed.\n\n3. no. Honor isn't something that's meant to get in a month or two, it's meant to be consistently nice over the course of a year. People need to learn to be patient considering you're supposed to be a decent human normally instead of just to get some type of reward.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Firu","date":"2017-07-06T13:27:36.575+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"The one problem with #2 is that I think Riot wants this system to reward good social behavior (e.g., not tilting, being supportive of teammates).  Stats would further make it a system that just rewards perceived skill.","replies":[]}]}
