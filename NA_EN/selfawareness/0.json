One of the things that makes league so great is that you have over 100 champions and have such a multitude of ways to specialize your playstyle with your favorites via masteries, runes, and in game items. (for example, I used to like to play AD/AP Shyvanna hybrid, you basically never see that, I felt original and it worked out well and was never predicted by the opposing team.)\r\nWell I can&#039;t do that anymore because now it makes me choose between either AD or AP. No point in playing akali anymore either IMO since i cant take both magic pen and armor pen, honestly idk what you were thinking Riot. You&#039;re forcing players to pick specific masteries for a specific champion - to raise the question, Why even have masteries at all now? Just build those stats directly into the champions and save me the time of having to reread the new stats the illusion of selection.\r\nI stopped playing World of Warcraft after they replaced talent trees with a similar BS system, (no more frostfire mage which was my main) it&#039;s actually heartbreaking to see a game you love go down the toilet. Maybe I&#039;ll try DOTA :/","replies":[{"poster":"Hethalean","date":"2017-03-02T18:39:56.852+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You mean for the Left most tree (forgetting name atm) with the 7% Magic Pen or Armor Pen?

It is next to the last one on the left. From there for your keystone you have the option of either Storaider's Surge for additional sticking power or Thunderlord's Decree for additional burst damage. Also the third option in the ferocity (left) tree gives you the option of either lifesteal and spell vamp (which most consider to be the better one) or attack damage and ability power.\n\nI much prefer the new tree, the old tree had more options but most of them sucked, meaning there were actually very few options in your trees. Basically you chose whether you wanted damage, utility, or defense, then what you needed second most, then put your points in that tree in (almost) the same place every time. Now instead of having the illusion of having many choices (while really being locked into most of them) you have one really big choice. That choice is, what keystone do I want? If you are an adc you could go with Warlord's Bloodlust for the lifesteal, Fervor of Battle for damage over time (although everyone considers that one to be weak right now after it was changed), Deathfire Torch for poke, Stormraider's Surge for sticking power, or Thunderlord's Decree for sticking power. Most classes are locked into less choices than that, but you get the point.\n\nPersonally right now with Shyvana I go down the Resolve tree for Grasp of the Undying with the rest of my points in ferocity. If you were going for a hybrid damage oriented build though, depending on what your build looks like, I would go 0/18/12 with your keystone being Thunderlord's Decree.","replies":[]}]}
