Perhaps not. A couple games ago I had a silver v in my game.  \n\nNeedless to say my eve gameplay sucked and I went 1-10 not knowing how to play her effectively. But you know what? Fuckkit. Riots algos in flex are so imbalanced there&#039;s really no point in treating this boosted queue as srsly as solo/duo. I&#039;d rather wait in a 20 minute queue and match with people on my skill level than waste 40 minutes playing a losing game that&#039;s based on luck  on who you get matched with (and how far their skill level differs). \n\nTl;dr: riot sucks at math. Flex queue is so boosted there&#039;s no point in treating it competitively as if it were different from normals.","replies":[{"poster":"Escheton","date":"2017-01-27T02:41:06.484+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you were in a region where they disabled normal draft, this is excusable behavior.
