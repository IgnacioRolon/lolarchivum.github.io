I am not trying to be too picky about the new Gnar skin--after all it&#039;s only a 975 cost. \r\n\r\nWhen Gnar is about to transform, he runs on his fours as we all know, but with the classic and Dino skins, he goes through 2-3 stages of colors leading to his change.  With the Gentleman Gnar; it feels inconsistent.\r\n\r\nFor example, I&#039;ve experienced a few times where I find myself quickly glancing at my champion while we&#039;re in a tense stalemate waiting for the first move.  Gnar goes sometimes a mix of white and dark red first, then all dark red.  Other times it seems like it&#039;s in reverse or it just does one or the other.  With the intense moments, I screw up sometimes while trying to time my bounce transform perfectly from attempted muscle memory to what I see.  I know, it sounds silly, however I started to pay closer attention and noticed the errors. \r\n\r\nWas this unintended, or just the way that it is? \r\n\r\nThanks! \r\n\r\nPS; love the skin otherwise, especially the back animation with Mega Gnar recall xD","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-08-16T00:55:05.119+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hiya! \n\nThis is absolutely a bug and we're working on a fix to make this transition a bit smoother. :]","replies":[]},{"poster":"GreenLore","date":"2015-07-21T11:28:16.529+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I guess this should be posted into the \"report-a-bug-forum\",this one is for fanmade skin and champion concepts.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Attysu The Poro","date":"2015-07-21T07:07:12.511+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hm, as a person who bought Gnar at launch with his skin and found out I was trash with it him...
