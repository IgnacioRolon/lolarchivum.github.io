Furthermore, I can't bring computers to school for playing the game because I need administrator rights and they can't give it to me. So, I had a solution, I will rent a room to do the tournament and I will film the event and broadcast it on Twitch etc. On the other hand, I don't have enough computer to do the tournament. We will be nearly 30 participants wich means 6 teams. I tought of contacting some company to sponsor me and to lend me computers to do the tournament. Do you think it will work? Wich company should I contact? Please help me because I'm a fan of League of Lgends and I want to do a tournament that really looks like a riot event.","replies":[{"poster":"Aeszarck","date":"2016-12-22T22:48:32.631+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not here to give advice, but to show my support for you!

I wouldn't suggest trying to bypass that in any way.  They're usually good about that stuff, so I hope they can help!","replies":[]}]}
