My question is what is to become of skins like Sherwood Forest Ashe or Sasquatch Nunu?  These skins are already basically what chroma&#039;s will be correct?  Any insight on this would be appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Garurumon","date":"2015-04-18T21:51:51.872+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"They will stay the way they are until the champion recieves a MTU or relaunch, where the recolors will most likely become a remodel instead.","replies":[{"poster":"TauNoob1","date":"2015-04-18T22:34:12.282+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Garurumon,realm=EUW,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=xFjuzMZs,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-04-18T21:51:51.872+0000)\n>\n> They will stay the way they are until the champion recieves a MTU or relaunch, where the recolors will most likely become a remodel instead.\n\nThis^ ROIT's confirmed they will not change for a while.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Heckin Support","date":"2015-04-19T01:56:31.734+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I still hate how Sherwood Ashe is blonde in splash art but not in game, but Freljord Ashe gets to be blonde.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-04-18T21:46:09.420+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The skins that are just recolour version of the classic will get reworked sooner or later (like say take a look at Assassin Yi), you can only hope the one you like is the next on the to-do list.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Remlap1223","date":"2015-04-19T13:22:03.294+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not exactly.  Nunu needs a VU, and once that happens, he'll get a remodel on his recolor.  Ashe is probably going to eventually get the Alistar treatment or a small TU like Janna, and her recolor skins will be slightly augmented.
