But now whenever he ults he gains 50% cooldown reduction on his q???????? I really don't understand why he has gotten this it just feels like he is unstoppable 10 minutes into the game where he just continues to stack while he 3 shots whatever top laner he is against. If they do this big of a buff to nasus why hasn't other champs that are forgotten like aatrox have some sort of buff this big.","replies":[{"poster":"KVbqbFsC8e","date":"2017-08-30T19:30:05.219+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"He had one the lowest winrates for the last 2 years.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-08-30T20:13:18.642+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Nasus is weak.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Quepha","date":"2017-08-30T19:30:17.050+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"because he was garbage\nbtw he's still garbage","replies":[]},{"poster":"jwebb0113","date":"2017-08-30T19:19:02.725+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"but he wasnt strong he was barely playable... and now with the buffs he sits at a 50% win rate in plat +","replies":[{"poster":"Apocyliptic","date":"2017-08-30T19:23:37.246+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's lower than that, about 48-49 in plat and up and 46-47 in diamond and up.
