So I can definitely see that getting slashed, as well as the insane burst from E, but I don't see why Skarner has to lose that amazing shield value on W or his base AD. Since he won't clear with E anymore, that means he has to rank up Q and autoattack a lot, meaning the shield value (at least) should probably not change.

It felt less like a good vs bad Skarner use case and more of a binary decision on when to ult. And i find the AS/move speed given when you stun people feels a little cluttered and a very hard skill to maximizes and play around, it feels like a bonus that doesn't offer much meaningful decision making or interesting play, it just grayed the lines on when he is and isn't powerful. I felt like skarner should hit hard and be terrifying in his zone but be more of a small-ish CC low dmg meat wall when not in his zone, i think the graying of that distinction may have hurt him and added to much power.\n\nsorry if that's come across as harsh in any way, i actually LOVE the new skarner i just really really hope the focus for his strength can be in his zones and i'm just worried that the proposed nerfs are hitting him in every situation and even more so in his zones as the base AD hurts more when you have high attack speed. \n\nSo in essence if you can find a way to nurf him when he is outside his zones but keep him strong in his zones (similar to the initial iteration) i would very much love that.

She was strong (used in LCS in the midlane), but uninteresting. The rework made her more fun, and put her in a good place (she was even used in LCS to great success too).\n\nThe easiest place to look at would be Garen's Passive Perseverance.

The passive is called “Perseverance”, so this should mean that he will stay alive longer than anyone else, WHILE IN THE MIDDLE of the battle.

He's op.  What are you doing about it?  Not a thing.  At least not for now.  This is just one instance.  I mean, look at Skarner.  I'll give you props for actually 'hotfixing' the issue, like two weeks late, but he shouldn't have been shipped out like that.  He's broken.  Who in the office played that guy and went,''Nah Skarner is in a good spot''.  It's ridiculous man.  This happens every patch.  Every.  Time.  There are better, more fun moba's now where that doesn't happen.  You are no longer the only good one.  There are options, and people are starting to use them.  You've GOTTA start being smarter, listening to the community more, and stop releasing broken champs, over complicated champs, and doing 'weird and crazy' things for the sake of 'being in a good spot'.  That's my two cents man.  \nNot trying to be mean, its just that this has been happening for a year now and you keep going in the wrong direction.  You don't have to do everything the community says, but when you have a hive mind telling you what the problem is, its easy to see what you're doing right and wrong - but Riot doesn't seem to listen to that.\nAnyway.

He's almost certainly too strong, and we'll probably go through with the nerfs in 5.17, he's not so out of line we need to act before the next regular patch though. Taking the time to assess how he's doing a bit more as a result.\n\nI think players just need some time to adjust to the new Garen. The way he's played before and after hasn't really changed; but the times where he's actually deadly to fight against have. A lot of players I've seen are still trying to facetank Garen's damage late-game like you could before so it's pretty apparent that they're not used to the changes that have happened yet. His winrate has been going down and up constantly with the lower winrates being in the 52% range and the higher ones being 55%. (In Plat+ games)\n\nI do think Deadman's Plate in general is a bit too strong though.","replies":[{"poster":"God King Morde","date":"2015-08-25T18:56:44.685+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"PLEASE dont nerf garen.\nas a pre rework garen main his damage only slightly went up but his tankiness went down by alot and forces you to build more tank items. people say he got stronger only because in the past they built full tank and said \"garen was useless\" the few good garens out there know that pre rework garen and old garen are pretty close in strength but now people are building damage.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Hella Kaiser","date":"2015-08-24T17:26:16.868+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"the new morde is a mess! i don't know wtf to build! ad,ap,tank,ms,items that slows... wtf riot! at least before he could tank as a riven can do but he didn't have cc or mobility... now to win as morde you need luck or a stupid enemy so you can land the 3° q...","replies":[{"poster":"Shuveliq","date":"2015-08-25T10:31:56.033+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Get rylai 1st item then go from their I normally go Rylai into Titanic into  HP + Armor/MR based on the match up.
