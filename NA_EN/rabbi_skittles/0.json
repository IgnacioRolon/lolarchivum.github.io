He presumably is related to the same source as Nocturne and Shaco (Listed as related champions).\n\nMalphite, we know, must be some sort of giant elemental. A rioter commented that, in lore, he's literally the size of a mountain.\n\nMorgana and Kayle will likely be VU'd together, and get proper updates then.","replies":[{"poster":"Rabbi Skittles","date":"2016-12-19T04:41:05.076+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hadn't actually heard about the short stories about Jax and Fiddles, that's actually pretty sweet to hear!

While Im not really a fan of the little two-three sentence filler entries but even they would be better than the old stories that reference stuff that no longer exists. \n\nI'm just bringing this up because they've touched on the Shadow Isles twice since the retcon and while I really do appreciate the big updates they've been putting out its sad that these last little blank spaces have fallen on the wayside. \n\nMy bet would be Kayle and Morgana will see some love with an update to Demacia.

They should be independant characters with residence in those nations.\n\nThey´re angels, beings from another planet, and as far as Aether Wing goes, technologically advanced.
