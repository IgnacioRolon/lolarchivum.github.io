The rate of key fragments are just like before the honor system.  The only difference now is the opportunity for additional key fragments through the new Honor capsules.  Sometimes you may need to relog the client as well to see the notice that you received them.  Nothing seems out of the ordinary here, you'll just have to continue playing!  I hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
