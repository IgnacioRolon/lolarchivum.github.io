I already talked to my IP and they said it was nothing wrong on their end.\r\n1. I start up que get into champion select pick the champion I wish to play then it goes into ban phase.\r\n2. Last person in the ban phase is choosing their ban.\r\n3. Randomly I disconnect from chat my internet is up still and working fine.\r\n4. I reconnect to chat but it still says they have 0 seconds to ban and no ban comes up.\r\n5. I can't lock in or choose a champion so I auto dodge and have to wait 5 minute to 30 minutes due to the dodge (It happens probably twice a day or more).\r\nI just want to put this on the boards to see if anyone else has this problem and knows a solution or if someone from riot can help me fix this problem.","replies":[{"poster":"RiotBok","date":"2016-05-19T20:44:30.246+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In a general sense, this just indicates that you're disconnecting from champ select.
