So my best way to explain this is for example the opponent stands still for a second then jumps to a different place in another second. It's kind of like that but it only happens a couple times but it always happens at the start of the game. I changed my setting to the lowest still didn't fix it. I also have really good ping 40ms and my frames are dropping at all. So idk what is going on. I'm about to start a full repair and see how that goes. If the full repair doesn't work is there something I can do?\n\nUpdate: Did a full repair didn't fix the issue next I'm going to do an uninstall then reinstall it and see if that fixes the issue if not I might not play league till I can fix it.\n\nUpdate #2: So I uninstalled and reinstalled; league still having the same issue. So I really don't know what to do since I can't play the game efficiently with this issue. Anyone have any advice that could fix this issue?","replies":[{"poster":"Chemoarish","date":"2017-07-09T15:28:09.566+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm having something similar , mine seems visual it's not ping and there is no way to adjust for it like I might with just higher ping. Fps shows fine i updated graphics drivers and still just like a random occurrence seems very frequent and makes it very hard to play at all.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-06T21:28:28.578+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The type of lag you're describing sounds an awful lot like packet loss. Packet loss happens when you're connection loses pieces of the data it's carrying before it hits our servers. Sometimes it happens due to weird settings but other times it's caused by a faulty node that your ISP is sending your connection through. \n\nRun through and check for any [**network settings**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) that you could update, but go ahead and reach out to our tech team in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) if that doesn't help!","replies":[{"poster":"Destructron","date":"2017-07-06T23:21:28.267+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Though this is the first time I've had this issue.
