If you're using an email on the account that you don't have access to, then we won't really have a way to get back to you.

The ticket won't show up on the history so that it won't warn the person who took it that you're trying to get it back.  It can take up to two days to get a response depending on ticket volumes so sit tight until then.  Also: don't make a new ticket until you hear back, doing so will send you to the back of the line again; we don't want that do we :)","replies":[]}]}
