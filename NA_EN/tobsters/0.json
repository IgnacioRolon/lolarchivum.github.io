Then you can upgrade your summoner spell to tier 3 with gold, at the shop perhaps, which gives it even better stats? And maybe give it 2 tier 3 upgrades that you can choose from, each gives a new effect  to the spell.\r\n\r\nHere are some thoughts of mine\r\n\r\nFlash:\r\nTier 2: Decreases cooldown to 270 seconds from 300.\r\nTier 3:\r\n1-Decreases cooldown to 240 sec.\r\n2-Decreases cooldown to 180 seconds. Cannot be used if you have taken or dealt damage in the last 3 seconds. (this one can help tanks engage while limiting their escape)\r\n\r\nIgnite:\r\nTier 2: Cooldown decreased to 180 seconds.\r\nTier 3:\r\n1-slows the target by 25%\r\n2-Deals 1% of the target&#039;s maximum health every second.\r\n\r\nCleanse:\r\nTier 2: Decreases cooldown to 180 seconds.\r\nTier 3:\r\n1- Decreases cooldown to 150 seconds.\r\n2- Makes your champion immune to all cc for 1.5 seconds.\r\n\r\nBarrier can give you either better shield or a % reflection to damage recieved.\r\n\r\nHeal can either have more heal or better move speed boost.\r\n\r\nAnd so on.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?","replies":[{"poster":"meaniehead","date":"2015-10-16T22:15:59.591+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a fun idea! Summoner spells are so stale at this point :/\nMaybe a lvl 3 upgrade to tp can allow you to tp on a champ directly(without giving them stasis) or barrier can share it with the next lowest champ near your champ.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Roodrak","date":"2015-10-16T18:20:44.513+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think Ignite should have its cooldown reduced (i don't know by what integer) if someone dies to it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"thewire666","date":"2015-10-16T14:40:13.403+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The last flash uboost is a nerf lol\nRip all champs without mobility","replies":[{"poster":"Tobsters","date":"2015-10-16T14:48:00.939+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm saying you can choose from the 2 tier 3 spells.
