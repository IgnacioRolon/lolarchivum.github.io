It's your ISP, or it's some problem at home. If you legit think Riot is doing this to its players purposely then you've got some fucked up idea of what lies in the realm of possibility.","replies":[{"poster":"skarner4lyfe","date":"2017-09-27T05:11:55.646+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"A tad gullible aren't we?  They use the same method casinos use to keep people playing.  Bait them enough and they'll keep playing.  The longer they play the more likely they'll spend money.  Every other game online is pretty much like this if it's free.  There is some type of pay to win system.  Just popped in 5 bucks and got really poor opponents.  Instantly won my first promo.  Let's see if I put in 5 more what happens the 2nd time.","replies":[{"poster":"FatedSaviour","date":"2017-09-27T06:43:52.335+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"wow u just commented to the same guy 3 times for one reply (if u count replying to yourself replying to him an extra reply)","replies":[{"poster":"skarner4lyfe","date":"2017-09-27T06:48:35.488+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I KNOW SO ODD ISN'T IT?
