Please help!","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"So I have been afk in games before, mostly because my computer stopped working or my internet got unplugged. Recently this happened a couple of times, which is why I made a specific attempt not to do so again, and be connected by making sure nothing else was running on my computer. As i was entering a match, my league stopped responding, and I had to wait about a minute as it connected to the game, which had already started. (i was playing jungle and i dont need a leash btw) I got in, and my team immediately remade, EVEN THOUGH I CONNECTED! It was like what, a minute or two into the game? I got my 20 minute queue which i have been trying to avoid very hard. This was a bug, because I DID reconnect in time. Just because i got the bugsplat thing i have to wait 20 minutes for 5 games, and I didnt deserve it. I really need to get this removed. Please Riot games do something for me!","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-07-09T17:48:44.348+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"/Remake becomes available at 3:00 if someone has disconnected or been flagged as AFK for 90 seconds. A disconnection has a negative effect on your teammates, even if the disconnection was not intentional. For this reason, the Leaverbuster system treats all leaves equally, and any penalties cannot be removed or modified in any way. We have FAQ's for both [/Remake](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/208754686--Remake-FAQ) and [Leaverbuster](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ) if you'd like more info.\n\nSince you're experiencing bugsplats, the cause is likely a hardware or driver issue. I recommend trying the solutions on our [Bugsplat guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes) in order to resolve this and avoid future penalties.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[{"poster":"YashyDoodle","date":"2016-11-10T00:47:04.262+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the reply on this post!

How many games were you flagged by LeaverBuster (the answer is: not a few)? \n\nConsidering the games (and time) that you ruined (regardless of your intentions) for 9 other people (per game that you have been flagged by LeaverBuster), a 20 minute queue timer (during which you can do other things, just an FYI) is a comparatively **light** punishment.","replies":[]}]}
