Opening a second can actually drop your case to the end of the queue with Player Support.  I'm sure it's very scary, especially when it is an account that you have such a sentimental attachment towards, but be patient.  Support will get back to you, typically within 24-48 hours.  Things are quite a bit different from how they were back in 2012, and Support is very good about answering tickets quickly now.","replies":[{"poster":"Baffometo","date":"2017-06-12T09:59:27.656+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think they already closed one of my tickets (the spanish one) but well Im still waiting I had to create a new account just to play for a while\n\nthis is so frustrating  =(","replies":[{"poster":"OnlyYouCanHearMe","date":"2017-06-12T23:34:09.284+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When players open multiple tickets for the same issue, Support will close the duplicate tickets to prevent them from making extra work.  It slows the process down, and ends up with potentially multiple Support staff working on the same issue.  Instead of having multiple Staff doing the exact same work on the exact same issues, which is a waste of time, they could be letting the case be handled by one person, and working on other cases themselves.  This is why players are instructed to wait for the response to their ticket without creating new ones, or repeatedly bumping them.  \n\nI know it's frustrating, but just try to be patient and don't submit any more tickets or bump your ticket.  It just drops you in the queue, and will only make your wait longer.  They will get back to you, just give them a chance.","replies":[{"poster":"Baffometo","date":"2017-06-13T03:49:17.626+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tbats what they did they closed one of my tickets and now they are handling eveyrthing by email\nIm still waiting for their resolution atm they just asked me like personal data of my account like date of creation, my first RP purchase and things like that \n\nAt least they replied \n\nIll keep posting updates :D","replies":[{"poster":"OnlyYouCanHearMe","date":"2017-06-14T16:39:00.131+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That is the typical \"account compromise\" response.  And if it appears to Riot's system that an account has been compromised, it is immediately locked, and the account will display the \"this account has been suspended\" popup.  It's just locked for the safety of the actual owner of the account, and is typically resolved easily enough by answering the questions that Support has.  Don't worry if you cannot answer all of the questions, just answer as many of them as you can. \n\nHopefully this will be the only problem with your account, and no issues with the potential hacker doing any rule-breaking!  Once you have it back, be sure to change all your passwords and make sure they are extra secure.  (Support will recommend you do that as well.)  You might also want to consider changing the password to the email account you use to set up your league account, just in case that was how the hacker found their way in, and check with your credit card to see if you have any suspicious charges on there since the time your account was locked.  It never hurts to be a bit on the safe side.","replies":[{"poster":"Baffometo","date":"2017-06-14T20:18:21.495+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks friend\nYeah Ill do all that and ive been checking my CC charges im a lil paranoid HAHA\nand indeed they sent an email askin me personal questions \natm im just waiting for heir response :D","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"DJMason88","date":"2017-06-12T01:44:00.582+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Permanent suspension usually only comes from cheating (or using an unsupported 3rd party program sometimes) or when your account is compromised so riot locks it down until they can get it under control.

I think that may have happened in the past, but for most of the cheats (scripting, botting, banned third party programs, account sharing, boosting) there is no longer a policy of a warning prior to the account being punished.  Depending on the type of cheat, accounts may be permanently suspended as soon as the cheat/hack is discovered. \n\nBut, that doesn't mean that is the reason for the suspension of your account.  It may very well be due to a potential compromise, in which case Support will be able to tell you.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Allukaaa","date":"2017-06-12T00:48:42.770+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know I am his wife we were trying to login but only my account works and all the time we play together this is so wierd I hope Riot will fix this =(","replies":[]},{"poster":"DuckOnQuack","date":"2017-06-12T12:56:57.868+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Baffometo, I completely understand right now...
