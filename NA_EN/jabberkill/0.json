So my idea is to take more IP not only when there is IP boost to play with your friends. For an example: \r\n - There are 3 tickets at the start of the day. Each ticket can be used to predict (lose/win next game) so everyone at the start of the game that thinks that will win, can use a ticket. The tickets double the IP that you get from the game (but first win of the day doesn&#039;t double). If the player wins the match he gets double IP, and he loses one ticket. If he loses the predict, he does get a predict charm (5 of those create a ticket in hextech) and he loses the ticket.\r\nPlease tell me what do you think about this idea?","replies":[{"poster":"Selegun","date":"2016-11-15T16:27:18.813+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's a cool idea for sure.  My only thought is that something like this could be viewed as gambling and if I recall correct some public internet spots have a very strict policy against gambling.  While a great idea for sure it has the potential to limit the playerbase so I can see why something like this hasn't seen its way into League.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ArkVeil","date":"2016-11-15T15:18:58.567+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Problem with the ability to predict your own loss is people would actively **strive** lose. If you eliminate that, then you can only predict to win, thus would be no different from a normal IP boost. Still, it would be a nice concept to have some sort of IP boost as part of the hextech system. It would urge people to play more to get more charm.","replies":[{"poster":"JaBBeRKiLL","date":"2016-11-15T15:47:06.188+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ArkVeil,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=cPR8Ltf1,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-11-15T15:18:58.567+0000)\n>\n> Problem with the ability to predict your own loss is people would actively **strive** lose.

U explained it well why not to have a lose option.","replies":[]}]}]}
