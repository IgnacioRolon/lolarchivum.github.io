If this mana regen is taken away it will ruin sona and other mana heavy supports. For reference it&#039;s 1.25% of your missing mana every 5 seconds, and the closest we have in the new runes is manaflow band.  Manaflow band gives 10% of current missing mana every 60 seconds, and as far as I can tell you can not control it(so you can&#039;t use it when you want to, it will just sort of go off then you wait 60 seconds whether you wanted it then or not).  \r\n\r\nThis is overall a lot less mana regen and a lot less reliable.  If you run oom now, and you don&#039;t have mana flow coming up for another 40 seconds, guess what you&#039;re out of luck.  In current form sona will frequently go oom because she needs to spam spells and they have a high mana cost... I don&#039;t see how after the update this sort of playstyle will be viable.  I get that managing your mana is a &quot;skill&quot; but to me this makes the game a lot less fun and ruins my champ for me.  I would like some sort of item or some sort of rune that we can take to get back the old mastery.","replies":[{"poster":"Support Evelynn","date":"2017-09-28T14:56:53.995+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"You get biscuits which not only restore mana but give permanent increase to mana pool.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Khristophoros","date":"2017-09-28T03:59:48.402+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are also other mana sustain options you can get in addition to Manaflow Band.\n- Kleptomancy can randomly generate mana potions.\n- Presence of Mind gives you back some mana after autoattacking champions.\n- Biscuit Delivery gives you 4 15% missing mana restores over 12 minutes. \n\nAlso, you didn't consider the fact that Manaflow Band actually makes a spell free in addition to the mana gain.
