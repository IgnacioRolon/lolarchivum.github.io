Since switching to PC gaming, I've found it's much harder to find large open communities for gamers to socialize, brag about their best games, or just hang out and talk. Well, if anyone is interested, I have an offer.\r\n\r\nI am looking for **friendly** League of Legends players, regardless of skill, who want to be more social in game.** If you're 16+, own a mic, and have Discord**, just message _WarTurtle0211_ on discord, or in League Of Legends any time. (Will provide you the link in a chat.)\r\n\r\nHopefully we can keep things civil by enforcing a \"Zero Tolerance Policy\" in regards to drama. Don't start anything, if you have an issue, approach a server admin, and we will resolve the problem.\r\n\r\nWe hope to provide a network that will always provide teamates when wanted. But, that is not our only goal. We want members of this server to actively talk about champions, CS techniques, item builds, anything at all league of legends, we urge you to share. As a community we can grow in skill through socialization. **Looking forward to hearing from you!**\r\n\r\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}} \r\n_WarTurtle0211_ {{champion:127}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:134}}","replies":[{"poster":"âdí","date":"2016-12-20T19:09:57.384+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would love to join, I will send a friend request when I get home in like an hour","replies":[{"poster":"Xozi","date":"2016-12-21T01:10:45.117+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=narter4,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=sreyWAvf,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2016-12-20T19:09:57.384+0000)\n>\n> I would love to join, I will send a friend request when I get home in like an hour\n\nAlright looking forward to hearing from you!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Selegun","date":"2016-12-19T21:44:24.239+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll join if you still have room.
