That's about 120 wins a month (definitely more actual games, if you count losses as well).\n\nPlaying in a premade has slightly more chances for key fragments to drop BUT YOU MUST WIN A GAME in order to be eligible for a key fragment drop. And since the system works by chance drops, Riot also implemented fail-safes and if you don't get a drop after certain number of games (calculated by your chance for a drop), the system forces a drop for your next win.

Once you get lucky it's just shard. You need approximately 3 - 4 other shards to get a skin that's worth it. So it still ends up being circa 1 - 2 free skins per year, random ones, on champions you might not even enjoy playing.\n\nYeah, it's still free and nice, but you really make it sound so simple and worth it, not realizing that it was designed just as another questionable source of money. You get locked chest or redeemable shard, not a free skin. You get something that's supposed to temp you to forcely purchase key and forcely purchase several chests, hoping to accumulate enough Essences to redeem it, all of this random.\n\nDo you know what was free? A random (usually low-tier and cheap) skin you got at the end of season (not sure If Season 5 or 4) for good in-game behaviour. No chests you had to unlock, no shards you had to redeem, no plan you had to accumulate cores for, just that.\n\nNow people usually pull out the \"But deude, it's F2P, they need to feed their familiez that dont work, shut up, they dont owe you nothing, hurr durr\". To that I'll say - they released a skin which had more hype than quality, and although still very valuable thing that somehow took them year to develop and is maybe the best skin in terms of resource, it's more overrated than actually quality work - and it costs around 23€. Meanwhile, CD Projekt Red releases entire high-quality expansion pack with giant amount of new actor lines, with multiple actors, special storyline, new features and theme for 20€. While the latter can be pirated. Guess who I find more generous now? And Riot also sells recolors for real money that HotS offers for actually playing the hero, for free.\n\nCertainly, they offered something theoretically for free and kudos to them, we can enjoy, we enjoy, be happy, I don't stand in your way. But you put it in veeeeeery simple words, hiding a lot of scam it has beneath. Hextech chests, from business point of view, isn't morally as generous as you present it.\n\nAnd I may get overran by people who think I say that from pure entitlement, but it's simple fact.

I stopped playing League for about two months in the winter to work on college applications, so when I started playing again, I had a fresh Key Fragment cycle. (Each cycle lasts 30 days.) I decided to start recording data on how many wins it took me to get each Key Fragment because I thought I wouldn't get this sort of fresh chance again. I record every win and say whether I got a Key Fragment or not in it, and how big my premade was, if applicable. Every thirty days I start a new data table. \nI'm just one person and I am not playing very frequently because I have a ton of work to do for school and I also have karate, so if anyone knows when they get their next Key Fragment reset and wants to start pooling data, then just tell me. Just tell me how big your premade was for each win, and make sure to keep track of how many wins it took you to get each Key Fragment. Each one has a different drop rate, so we need to calculate each percentage individually. Losses do not matter, nor do grades.\n(Sorry about the formatting.)\n---\n2/6 - 3/7\nhttp://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/2418472209/227894082?tab=overview League of Legends Match History Y\n\nhttp://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/2420501185/227894082?tab=overview League of Legends Match History Y\n\nhttp://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/2420714163/227894082?tab=overview League of Legends Match History Y\n\nhttp://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/2420771994/227894082?tab=overview League of Legends Match History Y2\n\nhttp://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/2421676400/66101849 League of Legends Match History N5\nhttp://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/2421827461/66101849 League of Legends Match History N\nhttp://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/2421864066/66101849?tab=overview League of Legends Match History N\nhttp://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/2422392020/66101849?tab=overview League of Legends Match History N\nhttp://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/2422397373/66101849 League of Legends Match History Y\n\nhttp://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/2422502127/227894082?tab=overview League of Legends Match History N\nhttp://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/2422735059/227894082?tab=overview League of Legends Match History N\nhttp://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/2422936035/227894082?tab=overview League of Legends Match History N3\nhttp://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/2428249005/66101849 League of Legends Match History Y\n\nhttp://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/2429315965/66101849?tab=overview League of Legends Match History Y\n\nhttp://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-history/NA1/227894082 League of Legends Match History Y\n\nhttp://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/2429407241/227894082?tab=overview League of Legends Match History N2\nhttp://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/2429476013/227894082?tab=overview League of Legends Match History N2\nhttp://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/2430444670/227894082?tab=overview League of Legends Match History N\nhttp://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/2432033106/227894082?tab=overview League of Legends Match History Y\n\nhttp://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/2435379358/227894082?tab=overview League of Legends Match History N\nhttp://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/2435463201/227894082?tab=overview League of Legends Match History N3\nhttp://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/2436508982/227894082?tab=overview League of Legends Match History N\nhttp://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/2436747077/227894082?tab=overview League of Legends Match History Y\n\nhttp://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/2436830708/227894082?tab=overview League of Legends Match History N\nhttp://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/2443104850/227894082?tab=overview League of Legends Match History N\n---\n3-8 -

I guess you won't know which Key Fragment you're getting though.\n\nYou're probably at the last Key Fragments of your cycle though. More than thirteen wins to get a Key Fragment is quite a lot. You'll start earning a lot more at the rate you're playing when your cycle resets.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Mizuki Zahra","date":"2017-04-07T17:31:07.251+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"bump","replies":[]}]}
