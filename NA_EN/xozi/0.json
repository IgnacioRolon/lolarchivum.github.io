The guy can walk around with a DRAGON. He gets a shield based off his AOE damage in front of him, and all around his kit needs absolutely zero buffs. If you can't do well with this champion, its not the champions fault. Maybe you should just stick to Annie. I personally hope he gets reworked soon. He has blistering cool downs early game, and straight cheeses anyone who duels him.

So walk away once he pushes you under tower? And lose lane? Because as he clears the wave, his AP damage is converted into a shield that very, VERY slowly decays. Let's not forget if he kills something big enough, he gets to walk it around the map.\n\nOh but he's not broken. He's just an off tank with insane harass at range and a low cooldown shield that scales incredibly well late game. I mean, hey, people take meta top laners bot lane all the time. Because they can all do that. Darius is a great bot laner too. And garen! (Sarcasm). If you think \"walking away\" being the ONLY solution doesn't make a champion broken, then please, go back to playing the broken champs and defending them. \"Walk Away\" is not a proper strategy for laning. And provides a rather boring gameplay.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-01-22T05:28:36.571+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Siphon does _damage?_ What are you playing in top lane that cant waveclear faster than that...?\n\nHe has no harass at range at all, siphon is extremely easy to avoid due to very short range, and it does pathetic damage even if it hits.\n\nYou are  a bit late to the party, morde has not been played botlane for quite a while now, and he got a giant nerf and change due to how annoying it was.

Sorry to say, but people definitely still play him bot lane.\n1. Nearly every ADC takes mana. He doesnt. So even if you harass, he will out sustain and clear waves.\n2. No one else in the game can lead around a dragon.\n3. Most ADC's dont have escapes so if the support happens to slow you he's going to make you burn flash to get away.\n4. HE GETS A SHIELD BASED ON AP DAMAGE.\n\nHe is insanely annoying and I have no clue why Riot thought his ult would be a good idea.\nFurthermore, I have no clue why anyone would say he needs a buff. Sorry, not sorry. I've seen Mord bot lately than ive ever seen him top. And that is sad because that is the lane I main.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BeatzBoyFTW","date":"2017-01-22T05:24:32.068+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well it's not like he has CC to \"slow\" you down, and Rylai's nerf kinda impacted him hard.

They can do very well and really wreck teams, but that's really only the people who main them which is pretty much the only people who actually play them, so it feels like when you are facing them that they are really strong but it's because most of the time it's only the experienced players that are playing them. Do I feel Morde needs anything? He definitely doesn't need a nerf, but I could agree with the people asking him for a buff. I just don't think he needs as big as a buff that a lot of people are thinking, but some small buffs at first, or just a rework but that probably won't happen.\n\nI just feel that he is in such a weird position right now. I honestly don't even really know which lane he is suppose to play now, though I'm guessing mostly top now. Since he used to be mainly a top laner (and mid laner) but then they reworked him into a melee AD for bot lane, which he was OP at first and then nerfed out of there (Maybe he can do fine bot lane still)...I don't even know if he'll be able to survive the jungle though it would be cool if he was more of a jungler with that Dragon ghost. \n\nBut really, I feel that he might just need changes to make him more of a reason to pick him.","replies":[{"poster":"Xozi","date":"2017-01-29T03:22:26.749+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I played top for about 4 months straight and never saw him once in my lane. I play ADC for a couple days and see him twice in bot lane. And he does more than fine bot lane. Everything they did to nerf him, is compensated by nearly any support with hard CC. Good luck walking away from a mordekaiser when Lux slows and stuns you or Blitz pulls you and knocks you up. If you get within range of Mord in bot lane, if youre not playing Ezreal or someone with a built in escape in their kit, you're going to burn flash, and you're going to get CC'd again as soon as its off cooldown. Only this time with no flash. Mordekaiser just needs a complete rework.","replies":[]}]}]}
