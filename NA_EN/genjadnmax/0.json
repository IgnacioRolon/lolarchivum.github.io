If it doesn't freeze before I enter a game, there is a possibility of a complete crash, blue screen, or auto restart mid-game. \r\n\r\nI'm playing on Windows 10 64-bit with an ATI Radeon card.\r\n\r\nI've tried un- and reinstalling LOL and updating my graphics driver. Neither have helped. \r\n\r\nHas anyone else experienced this? Any ideas on what to do?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-12-15T21:37:07.029+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've often seen freezing cases caused by the [Xbox Game Bar](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html) bar.  Disable that and test it in a custom game.  The blue screen might indicate a more severe hardware issue too.  :(  Double check your airvents and check for overheating, it could be the culprit!","replies":[]}]}
