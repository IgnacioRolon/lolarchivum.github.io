Your losses are right next to your wins.","replies":[{"poster":"Nucleophilic atk","date":"2014-10-23T22:32:29.378+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is this for that specific game mode?

ARAM for ARAM. Dominion for Dominion. Co-Op is for Co-Op, and so on. Ranked is this season only. (Though you can view your past season ranked stats from the Leagues tab and switching to the other years.) Also, when you go in custom matches, it will only show your normal wins/losses. Custom matches don't count (whether solo custom vs 5 bots or 5v5). The wins/losses on every mode is total from the creation of your account (So you could also count the number of total ranked matches you did each season through the Leagues tab and add them all up so count how many total ranked you've ever done). So you could basically see how many Summoner Rift matches you've done and so on. Like if you have 233 wins and 267 losses, that's a total of 500 normal matches. Oh, and Team Builder is also only Team Builder (will not show your other normal wins). Normal Blind/Normal Draft do count together though.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"GameShyGil","date":"2014-10-23T20:18:00.688+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"At the end of a match it will tell you how many wins and losses  you have for that particular game type in largish numbers below the XP bar.
