It was bound to whatever attack thing that is where it creates the red arrows where you click, then I found out I couldn't click the shops or options or to add a point into an ability. I google'd it and saw other threads where they were told to close the game and delete some of the Config folder contents which I did and its still doing the same thing, it reset the graphics settings the red arrows no longer show on left click and set the client to Fullscreen instead of Borderless like I originally had but I still have to hold SHIFT to get into Shops or Options.\n\nWut do?\n\nEDIT(1): So its something in the PersistedSettings.json that looks like this \n\n\"name\": \"evtPlayerSelectClick\",\n                            \"value\": \"[shift] [Button 1]\"\nI removed the [shift] but when I open League it resets it back .. the input.ini is deleted and isn't showing back up.\n\nEDIT(2): Finally got the json file to stay deleted and it seems to be fixed now..

When ever i try to do something with the left mouse click i have to hold the shift key to do it. It sucks because i used to be able to click on the mini map for the camera to switch to the location i click on, now however i have to hold down the shift key to switch locations.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-03T20:42:56.421+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Left and right click are reserved keys, so they shouldn't be able to bind to other functions.  What happens if you swap to another mouse or keyboard entirely?  Do you have any programs or apps running that are performing macros or processes?  I don't recommend modifying or removing files unless specified, as it may end up causing you more issues.  As a first step, try swapping your hardware to troubleshoot.
