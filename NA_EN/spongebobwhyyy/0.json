Personally, I always try to be the best teammate I can be. I try to learn something new each game and try to constantly improve my play. I always ping MIA when my lane leaves, I camp tower when I am losing lane to avoid feeding, I try to position myself well so I don&#039;t get ganked or killed based on bad positioning, etc. However, I cannot control the actions of my teammates.\r\n\r\n**For those who have climbed out of bronze, what are some specific tips you can give me? **\r\n\r\nAlso, please don&#039;t flame or troll on this thread. I&#039;m looking for genuine advice.","replies":[]}
