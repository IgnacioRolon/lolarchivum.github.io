THAT CAN BE INTERRUPTED, and has a resource of 10% of your hp just to be interrupted, that is not broken powerful, that is broken REDUNDANT.\n\nSecondly, Riven builds hydra and bloodthirster in most scenarios so she has just as good lifesteal, paired with a shield that helps her for being aggressive, nice try. The only way Aatrox is super sustained is because he has so many AS steroids in his kit to make 3 AA proc sooner in battle.\n\nAnd please tell me how the revive passive is gonna help you survive in the middle of the enemy team hmmm? Aatrox passive is useless when you get left inside there team, it is at its strongest only during lane phase where you can dive for free, but falls off to almost uselessness late game.","replies":[{"poster":"humphreydump","date":"2015-11-04T20:04:15.790+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"if u need to ask how aatrox will survive a team with his passive then any futher comments i make to you will be like talking to a brick wall aatrox is a tank with high dmg and lifesteal nuff said if u cant figure it out from there than im sry that my attempts of trying to explain to you why your \"main\" is almost as broken as yi will never succeed because as a common quote where im from \"you cant fix stupid and you cant argue with crazy\"","replies":[{"poster":"Boulderox","date":"2015-11-04T20:18:14.235+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok, for one aatrox is by no fucking means a tank or a bruiser, if he builds any defenses he loses out on damage, and if you only build damage you cannot survive long enough to output the damage. Secondly, don't call out people as brick walls when statistically and factually riven is stronger in most cases, minus sustain. \n\nrivens passive gives her free damage for abilities, up to 50%, while Aatrox does 100% ad on extra damage from w, but COSTS YOU HEALTH in the process, so you are using your hp to do more damage and taking damage from enemy also, a lose lose situation.\n\nI am not an Aatrox main, I just can't see how you are saying Aatrox's AOE knockup is more oppressive than RIVENS AOE KNOCK UP when they do the same, where riven only has to hit a butto 3 times to do it while Aatrox loses 1/10 his hp to hope he lands uninterrupted, and stun on top of that. \n\nAatrox's sustain is the only thing he has to help him, his q and e in some ways hinder himself, as if he isn't stacking w, he can't survive long enough.","replies":[{"poster":"Shahamut","date":"2015-11-05T14:52:27.373+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There really is no comparison here.

They kept trying to 1 v s 5, they were pretty toxic, and it was just a pain to play with them.
