But i really do not see myself getting any higher than gold and Ive been stuck there for 2 years, i did put a lot of time and effort into learning every champ and abilities and focused on almost every aspect of the game and tune into a few a few channels that teach me how to play league better. But more often than not I find myself with others who do not understand that just csing and not being killed until out of laining phase is a good thing I can carry myself in lane but I dont know how you guys at riot expect me to carry more than 1 other person that is my support or just myself when im mid, i mostly play ranked alone because its my preferred game style so dynamic que does not help id rather wait 20 mins for a game that has an equal teams on each side than a 3 min loss of 20 lp because of uneven matchmaking, I ward, focus on turrets not kills ping for drags and all that but its pointless when people dont understand those key elements. I will miss you guys at riot for making jinx she will forever be my favorite champ but i guess ive reached my highest potential in League.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-11-04T03:04:53.245+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I started having fun when i realized ranked is stupid and useless, and a massive waste of time.","replies":[{"poster":"oSEXYPLATYPUSo","date":"2016-11-04T03:06:46.275+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so basically what i said about rank?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"oSEXYPLATYPUSo","date":"2016-11-04T03:01:23.622+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"just remember the actual point of the game is to have fun and enjoy it.\n\nhere is a though about rank...\n\nrank isnt something to be ashamed of. i feel rank is just a way for riot to put players of similar skill levels vs each other so they can have fair games and enjoy and have fun playing the game... hear me out...\n\nyou are bronze.. what if every game you matched vs plats and diamonds? and you get stomped up and down the map and the game is no fun to you.. are you likely to keep playing if that is what happens every time?\n\non the other hand if your plat/diamond whatever \"high\" elo if you playing vs people lower skill level then you is that fun not every being challenged? it would be like if you were to go play a game co op vs bots or a custom game vs bots and the difficult is set on easy?\n\nhow fun is that?\n\nso in theory rank is there to put us vs people we have a chance to win against while being challenged so the game is fun and rewarding at the same time and keeps you playing..","replies":[{"poster":"1 800 Top Lane","date":"2016-11-04T03:02:19.288+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Incorrect.\n\nNormal 5v5's 3v3's, Aram's and the rotational game modes are for \"fun\".

In ranked, I can understand the desire to have the perfect team, but you can't expect EVERY player to play on the same playing field. (Hence rank) People have varying playstyles, varying item builds, varying champion pools, varying preferred roles. There are so many different types of players in this game, that there's absolutely no way to be \"perfect\" at it. Besides, if everyone was \"perfect\", then what'd be the point.\n\nBut, ignoring all of this, people need to stop flaming people in normal games. They need to stop with the incessant \"mia\" pings. They need to stop with the \"dude, you're so trash\" commentary. They need to start giving actual advice, like, \"Hey, your opponent is taking advantage of you being out of position. Try to do 'x' and 'y' and see if that works.\" or \"Hey, your opponent is taking advantage of you not having 'mag res'. I know you want to rush damage, but trust me, building 'z' [Mag Res/Damage item] may help you.\"\n\nIf your complaint is that people are losing your ranked games, help them NOT lose them. HELP THEM HELP YOU.\n\n>Typically they also flame their team every time they make a mistake, to try and cover up the mistake (nobody is fooled).\n\nPlayers like this would go in to a 2v1 that they, by no possible means, would win, and then blame their teammates for not following up. Sure, maybe if they did follow up, you maybe [just maybe] could have gotten a kill or two, but what if they didn't think the kill(s) was worth it? What if they were busy taking a tower nearby (you know, those things that win us the game if we take enough of them)? What if they were behind and they weren't trying to take any unnecessary risks? What if they were oom or low on HP at the time, did you look to see?\n\nIt's just so ridiculous how hard people try to cover up their own mistakes, by use of flaming their teammates. Flaming your team doesn't erase the fact that you messed up, right then. You made that mistake, not your team. Just accept it and know how to not repeat the mistake in the future. Your team is there to help you. If you don't like having to rely on other players, you shouldn't be playing a team-based game. Go play single player ones and let us enjoy the team environment.","replies":[]},{"poster":"18 NAKED COWB0YS","date":"2016-11-04T03:36:21.484+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"whats funny is people dont understand what the word competitive game mdoe even means.\n\nhow would you feel if there was 2 different types of classes in your obvious 7th grade class? one for fucking around and one for taking shit seriously and you have to work as a team to get an A?

Also of note is the fact i have not been in a schoolroom of any sort in seven years, but if imagining everyone who disagrees with you as a small child helps you maintain denial, go ahead..\n\nCompetitive does not equal a need to be toxic trash and flame your team. Good sportsmanship is expected of professional sports players, they tend to not last long if they disrespect their team, or the other team. If you want to drag the analogy that far, it stretches a bit. Not that there is anything similar between babies playing a free online game in their spare time and highly experienced professional athletes.\n If you are not having fun, you have your priorities wrong. What is the point, otherwise? Ranked has no rewards except the rewards of playing the game itself - fun, achieving goals, improving your abilities.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"oSEXYPLATYPUSo","date":"2016-11-04T03:09:30.222+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{sticker:zombie-brand-clap}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"1 800 Top Lane","date":"2016-11-04T03:15:49.044+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"This is a game I agree.
