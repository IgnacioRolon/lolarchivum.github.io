Most champ selects that I have gone through since Xayah&#039;s release have been against me wanting to try Xayah jg. I studied her kit and came to the conclusion that it could work well with clearing jg camps, but the people that get assigned adc start complaining that Xayah is only supposed to be an adc champ, while Graves is an adc champ also, but he&#039;s been played jg frequently. I just wanna try the new champ. -.-\r\nShouldn&#039;t matter how I do it in norms.","replies":[{"poster":"Elder Dragon UwU","date":"2017-04-19T19:49:20.083+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I also gotta add that I got reported for no good reason earlier, because the adc didn't get his way.
