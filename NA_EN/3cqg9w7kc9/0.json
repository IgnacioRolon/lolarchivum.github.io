So, getting noobs implies you're getting players of low skill, implying that your MMR is low enough to be encountering players who aren't skilled/play like they're new.\n\nIf you're talking genuine trolls, then _they're not noobs, and criticising them is going to do fuck all besides entice them to troll harder._ _**Do not feed the trolls**_, it's a basic Internet rule.\n\nSo, if you're getting noobs, you're going to have to suck it up and prove you're better than them and climb to a higher MMR. If you're getting trolls, you're going to have to _not give them the reaction they want_, _report them_, and _**move on**_.\n\nEnd of discussion.","replies":[{"poster":"Ph03n1xdust","date":"2018-04-16T16:39:30.761+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":5,"body":"Haha reporting trolls, funny :D\n\nSadly it doesn't fckin matter.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"ParasiticBurn","date":"2018-11-16T19:33:37.233+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And we signed up to not be dragged down in a rank game for a player that doesn't know what dragon is.
