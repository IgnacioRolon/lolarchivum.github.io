Between playing ranked and playing on smurf's I have many more wins, but there's something special about having those triple zeros in the win column. Back in the day it used to be a tradition that people would ask to play with a rioter for their 1000th win on the old GD boards, so I'm hoping to recreate some of that magic with the 10th anniversary.","replies":[]}
