Guess y'all are just really on the ball with post launch review and/or discovered it before it went live, and just figured it wasn't important enough to warrant delaying the launch (which I agree with).","replies":[{"poster":"DuckCurry","date":"2017-07-11T15:53:03.005+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, we knew about it before going live {{champion:32}} .
