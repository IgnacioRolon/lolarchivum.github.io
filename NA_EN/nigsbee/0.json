Other games received noticeable improvements,\r\nbut League seemed to take a turn...\r\n\r\nThe main problem I'm having regards intensive teamfights. At the state I'm in, it's very difficult to be a\r\ncontributing player when my fps takes massive drops whilst in intensive teamfights. It drops from roughly 100-120 all the way\r\nto sometimes 15 fps! (It was never a problem with my 70 ti)\r\n\r\nI have no clue why this may be happening, so i really hope I can find some help\r\nThanks! :)","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-28T20:55:06.848+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm taking a shot in the dark here, but if you're running Windows 10, then you may have installed the Anniversary update that enabled Game DVR inside the Xbox app. You could [disable the game bar](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html) to see if it resolves the issue.\n\nIf it doesn't, then you may need to grab a fresh set of driver and ensure you've chosen the **'custom install'** and checked the box for a **'clean driver install'**.
