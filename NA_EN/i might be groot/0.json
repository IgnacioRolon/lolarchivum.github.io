I know it's not my internet as other people have been playing fine on it. I have tried bug fixing LoL on the login screen with no benefit. It's very frustrating as I keep being temporarily banned (5mins after failing to pick a champion or ban one in champion select) and cannot play games properly. Is there anything I can do to solve this? If it helps, I'm playing on a mac.","replies":[{"poster":"Dark Morgana","date":"2016-02-19T01:25:52.658+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey I might be Groot, \n\nSounds like your client is having a hard time connecting to your computer.
