I know one thing that everyone in the League of Legends community hates the most is Leavers. A system that I would think could help in preventing this is a system based on percentages of leaving the game.\r\n\r\nBasically, you would get punished when your leaving goes below a certain point.\r\n\r\n95% - 5 Minute queue in between Ranked games.\r\n90% - 10 Minute queue in between Ranked games.\r\n85% - 15 minute queue in between Ranked games.\r\n\r\nSo on and so forth until it falls below 70%\r\n\r\n70% - 24-Hour Ranked Ban\r\n60% - 48-Hour Ranked Ban\r\n50% - Week Ranked Ban\r\n\r\nThis system could reset monthly and only take effect when the user has played 10+ games.\r\n\r\nI hope this is something that could be implemented or a system very similar to this. It is almost impossible to win a 4v5 and is impossible to win a 3v5 when that happens. And it happens way to frequently.","replies":[{"poster":"The Fire on Fire","date":"2015-11-04T01:32:59.491+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IRRELEVANT:\n\nmy team won a 3v5 once","replies":[]}]}
