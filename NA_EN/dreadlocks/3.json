I don't like the way Q looks, or that it's this weird 2 set skillshot. I don't like that his ult indicator for finding a target is just as good for those avoiding him.. Its annoying, he's not a hunter anymore, he's a madman who swings his blades around and rawrs before he ults.\n\nFrom day 1 of PBE when i played Rengar i felt super superrrrr clunky. sure i've goten more use to it over the year, but its def not fluid by any stretch. From day 1, i knew his clunky kit would be compensated by the sheer power of his bonetooth neckless..\n\nIdc if Rengar is better or worse..

Basically, sometimes you design something that you think is great and you've ironed out the issues but it somehow missed the mark.
