As such i think that much burst doesn't fit the item, lowering the damage and cd on the active would make it less valuable for asasination patterns and still good for extendet dps patterns.\nLowering the ad is totally fine aswell, though i do think it will need either a buff to the on-hit or to the health it gives to compensate a bit.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Paress","date":"2016-03-14T20:10:43.992+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm a bit affraid that {{item:3074}}  will be forgotten ..\n\nI mean, with the Tiamat nerf and its final cost which is super high, there will be a huge gap between {{item:3074}} (75 AD) and {{item:3077}} {{item:1053}} {{item:1036}} (45 AD).

Titanic is supposed to be a Juggernaut item, and Juggernauts synergize with AD, CDR, and health stacking. They generally have VERY low base AS, and rarely build more.
