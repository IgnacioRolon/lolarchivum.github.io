I ended season 4 Silver 1 and I started season 5 Silver 2, I have managed to drop my ass all the way to silver 5 with 0 LP. I find it amazing and yet awesome that high skilled streamers can climb from bronze to diamond in a matter of hours/days. Now this is very unrealistic for the average gamer but can someone please inform me how I can escape this crap. I mean, do I really have to be at a diamond level just to climb low elo? I know i'm not that good but this isnt the first time ive had games look like this graph. Tips please.\n\nI had 100% Kill participation up to about 18 kills. Then as the game closed out in a Loss i finished 20/25 Kill participation.

I suggest you learn to play Yi jungle. I got from Bronze 5 to Gold 1 playing only Master Yi. If you want to climb you'll need to main a champion that can solo carry games.","replies":[{"poster":"Dreadlocks","date":"2015-02-04T09:43:22.504+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"perhaps this is kind of a loaded/dumb question.

Teammates, type of champions on each side, rotations, roaming, minion management, ect. \n\nThe only advice I can give you by going by your pic, is to roam. When you start to dominate mid, roam to the bot or top and give yourself a kill or 2. In bronze and silver, you have to carry yourself and not rely on your teammates. So pick champions that can snowball and go crazy. Roaming is one of the most beneficial things you can do when ahead. Also, be the shotcaller. If some idiot tries to ping Baron while the enemy team is still up, do not be afraid to say no. Positioning is also highly important that can either make you win or lose the fight. \n\nAnd try to watch some pro streams/esports that plays mid and see what they do and how they do it. Youd be surprised on how much you can learn from watching.\n\nOther than that, no matter how good you may be doing, you will sometimes lose because of your teammates. Best of luck to your games m8.","replies":[{"poster":"Dreadlocks","date":"2015-02-04T09:23:09.288+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah I roamed bot 2-3 times and each time was good trades for us.

Do things that would benefit only you and wield YOU the best results.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
