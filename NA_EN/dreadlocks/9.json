Now, I don't know how often this is acquired (almost never I assume since most people won't want an extra serrated dirk lying around), but the number makes a good case for talking about some things.\n\nJinx (our arbitrarily chosen ADC) has 82 armor at level 18 without items/runes/masteries.  With our 85 Lethality what is her armor against us?  The math is simple and works out to -3 armor, but there is an issue.  Lethality reduces the armor value used in the damage mitigation equation, but can't reduce that number below 0.  So we are wasting 3 Lethality, which isn't exactly a big deal.  But if we had more Lethality options we would quickly be wasting the Lethality on squishies and would start to be targeting tanks with it.\n\nZac (our arbitrarily chosen tank) has 84 armor at level 18 without stuff, and probably ~225 armor with stuff in the late game.  If the assassin has a Last Whisper upgrade (which they might, Mortal Reminder is good at preventing those annoying heals/lifesteal from saving an ADC), then they are ignoring ~40 armor before Lethality.  That leaves 185 armor, which goes down to 100 with the Lethality (glad that worked out to an easy number).  Zac was taking about 30% damage before all that, but is now taking 50% damage.  While this doesn't look that bad, you multiplied how much damage you are dealing to him by 166%.  Even a little more Lethality and you are doing a lot of damage compared to the \"no lethality\" expectations and each little bit you add to get the effective armor below 100 is more effective.  Ignoring more than half of a tanks armor feels really bad for the tank, and we didn't even add any armor shred.\n\nTL; DR and conclusion:\nWould I think it is reasonable to add more Lethality items?  One would be fine I think, especially when they do the new Rune system which would probably reduce the Lethality available outside of items.  The only objection I have to them now is that making large amounts of Lethality (>85) available would feel bad for a lot of people.  The assassins would be wasting money if they are doing their job (killing squishies), would be making tanks feel bad (ignore all of their armor purchases) and would negate what their counter should be (can't build enough armor to protect against the large amounts of Lethality).","replies":[{"poster":"DuskDaUmbreon","date":"2017-06-10T14:58:43.215+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"85.

It's the only class of champion that can fill the bot position. Literally in every comp. \n\nAnd the fact that AD Assassins can dip into a ton of AD itemization, insures that they arn't reliant on tons of items specifically tailored to them. And that extra itemization gives them that much added utility. \n\nI'm actually hard pressed to think of a \"utility for Assassins\" given that ghost blade is all ready a go to as a starting item. Duskblade acts a damage amp for stealth targets, and EoN a defensive utility. What could AD assassins possibly need, that isn't already covered in these items?","replies":[{"poster":"JavelinJoe","date":"2017-06-10T04:12:18.383+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not even all assassins build AD.

More damage is never going to be a good way of making an Assassin item. Because every other class can build it and just as easily perform the assassins job. (Why do you think DFG is no longer a thing?) \n\nTo that end, AP itemization doesn't have anything specifically tailored to Assassin either. Though it seems that Gun blade and Proto belt have found niches within certain assassin builds. And Fizz/Ekko have their synergy with Lich bane. (Which is why they also have synergy with ICB/TF)","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Melledoneus","date":"2017-06-10T01:04:50.538+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Assassin items should provide less raw stats but more utility.
