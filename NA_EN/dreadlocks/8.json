Right now it costs so much cuz it's among the most expensive  [the most expensive? tanky items] in the game... if it was cheaper with weaker stats it could compliment the class it was intended for. Similar to Rylias.. it was buffed to 100ap, and during the mage update they buffed the hell out of the slow. before those buffs though, it was as popular as current mallet aka not very. even before the buff to 100ap it wasn't even that popular because it didn't give burst mages enough ap to justify building it.. but after it was buffed to 100, there was literally no downside to having it.\n\nMallet is not in the oppressive state that rylias was because it hasn't been massively buffed like rylias was... but we shouldn't have to put it in that state to call for a change.. like many other items in this game, they are nerfed and left in bad states because a lack of attention, i.e wits end, zekes, etc... Why not attend to mallet right now?
