I proved that here for MR and they have the same formulas, the amount of MR didn't change the ratio of effectiveness for flat ap blues vs mpen blues.

Against 2 armor items it gets significantly outclassed pretty quickly, I'd be willing to say the small powerspike on Youmuus isn't worth building it next patch.
