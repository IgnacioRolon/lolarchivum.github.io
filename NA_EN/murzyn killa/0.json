With that being said, it doesn't actually look like the mastery data for that match has been fully uploaded quite yet, possibly due to how many back to back matches you've been playing. Let's give it a day, and make sure to refresh your client, and if you still don't see it try to grab a screenshot of your Match History where you earned that S for me!","replies":[{"poster":"Murzyn Killa","date":"2017-08-08T02:15:23.077+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://imgur.com/6VJM5En    heres the image just got an S+ too and still no chest","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-12T00:50:35.884+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahhhhh I see the problem here now. The reason you haven't gotten that chest for getting an S on Twitch yet is due to the previous chat penalty your account had.

Also your account can only store 3 chests  at a time. and if you use those available chests by earning S ranks in the same week any game beyond that till you earn another are ineligible. you can only recharge 1 a week hence the reason for 52 possible in a year.\n\n( also if a person goes 6 weeks without getting an S after earning all 3 stored than they can no longer earn 52 in a year. for 3 weeks did not accumulate a chest due to the allowed current amount being maxed out.)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Murzyn Killa","date":"2017-08-11T03:05:26.410+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"anything? still havent received it and have gotten like 8 s's on him","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Gazpa","date":"2017-08-07T11:11:36.282+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same for me just now, with Warwick, first game in like 3 days.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Killme304","date":"2017-08-07T08:58:33.708+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My premade just got a S each in my last 2 games, but I also got no chests.
