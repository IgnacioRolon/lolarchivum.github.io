I hate them, they ruin my games. But after a while I just get pissed about it! Sometimes after telling people to chill out and stop being toxic, i will resort to just telling them to shut up, and mute them. But other times I know I can't afford to mute the team member because they DO give useful information and I DO want to win my games. Is it wrong for me to retaliate by telling them THEY are the ones playing bad, and ruining team fights? I usually say something like \"You're the one being bad stop talking\" or if I get really tilted off it I say \"You're so stupid just stop talking and play\".\r\nMy concern is if this is too much of myself being toxic in return? I know that I shouldn't say anything at all, but it just builds up when someone does it every game!{{champion:518}}","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-11-10T03:09:48.858+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ever heard the phrase \"dont feed the trolls\"?","replies":[{"poster":"C9 Scott","date":"2019-11-17T02:20:00.749+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Someone said this to me once and it pissed me off like nothing else.

They see you think they are toxic, so they have a time to reflect.\nMost of the time, not always, the toxic people actually just stop.\nThe best part is, you're not flaming, you're not being toxic or rude, you're just making an observation and letting it go.","replies":[{"poster":"Skt T1 Deadproof","date":"2019-11-10T15:34:05.127+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"There should be harder punish for those people, and some kind of a reform even for those who got perma ban, or some kind of apeel which will make them looking better not just sepparating TOXIC and NON TOXIC\nits because of several reasons.\nNon toxic people will not get banned, than can provocate u on so much ways just so u can tell offensive word and that they can report u. Even tho they just int or throw, it will take alote longer for them to get banned for THAT KIND of offense sence the Automatic Ban System doesnt recognize if u playing just bad or doing it intentionally. I have tested this. i had account which i made in just intention of inting and trolling to see how much it will take me to get banned, emagine my suprise when i lvled 26 lvl's with constent int and trolling my team , even writting that i gonna int and so on.They can make u toxic with just theyre action, for example is that inting, when i done that, people consistantly flamed me, and i understand that, but if i just didnt talk back and continued to do it i wouldnt get banned, and the people i reported for verball harrassment and so on .. they did get punished while i did not. It took me about 3 or so months of consistent feeding and inting and telling in game that i gnna do that to get banned.\nand to be completly honest i would still have that account if i just muted and inted and did same thing i did.\nthere are many ways of toxicity which is sad. This is a game, competitive one if i may add. There will be trash talk, but if u Riot just would try focus more on toxicity of a gameplay and not just \"chat\"   it would be a better system overall.\nThis is a game SO GAMEPLAY should matter too. \nNot a chat which is just in game function, side thing which is added to communicate with u teammates. And which for u can get Higher and Faster PUNISHMENT then from a gameplay  which we all agree is important, we all wanna rank up and reach that sweet gold,plat,dia or what ever ^^\n\nBut that's just my oppinion i guess. {{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CominTowardsYa","date":"2019-11-10T05:33:18.180+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I just ignore what they do and say, and point out objectives or tactics.
