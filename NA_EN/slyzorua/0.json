Does anybody know of a fix? Is there a setting that disables it because I've repaired the game so often and have also reinstalled the game twice with no positive results.

Our official FAQ says it's only activated on multikills and that hasn't been changed recently. \n\nOur assumption is that the Practice Tool is showing the banner because it's practice, where you can test things like that to see how they look maybe?","replies":[{"poster":"SlyZorua","date":"2017-10-05T05:31:02.411+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there, while I was watching one of Gripex's recent YouTube video it shows him and the opposition nidalee with a mastery banner and it wasn't a multikill, it use to show mastery on kills in my matches but when I came back from my ban, I couldn't see the announcer banner. So does my  recent 14 day suspension from 2-3 weeks ago have anything to do with this?
