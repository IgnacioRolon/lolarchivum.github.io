At the beginning, I had not downloaded the new client yet. Every time I got to the log in screen, I would type my username and password, press enter, and wait. The outcome was usually a pop-up window in the client saying that I couldn't connect to pvp.net, and had a link to some suggestions to try and fix that. Tried going through internet explorer settings, internet settings, used the hextech repair tool, used the built-in repair tool, downloaded the new client to see if I'd get a different outcome, used the hextech repair tool AGAIN, repatched, restarted my computer, and tried all of the troubleshooting again.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-28T23:17:54.068+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"PvP.net is a pretty important service for League, and these types of issues are often caused by incompatible local network settings that conflict with League.
