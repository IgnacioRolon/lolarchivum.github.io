But instead of just going into work at Riot Games, i would like to get a proper job training etc.\r\nThe positions i saw at the riotgames.com website in the career tab all seemed to be aimed at already trained/atleast mildly experienced people.\r\n\r\nSo, i wanted to ask if there is any way for me to get an actual job training in Germany, or are you guys only hiring trained people?\r\n\r\nI would be really happy about an official answer,\r\n\r\nGood luck in the rift,\r\nPascal Strau√ü (That means ostrich in german, i also run like one, might come into handy!)","replies":[{"poster":"RiotSomeOtherGuy","date":"2017-04-06T18:00:55.792+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It kind of depends, what sort of work are you interested in? Software engineering? Game design? Playtesting? QA? Art? In general, experienced applicants are a higher priority. However, for most job types, you can do a lot of self-education and build up a portfolio of projects to use when applying. For example, if you're interested in software engineering, you can build personal projects to put up on Github. \n\nWe do have some entry level positions sometimes (for example some of the engineers I've worked with came here as their first job after finishing college) but as for training you're kind of expected to self-train and learn by doing. Your coworkers will teach you, but it's not quite like being in school and going to classes.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Yuujou","date":"2017-04-11T04:28:25.909+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"To piggy back off of this comment, our open jobs are listed because we want people who will level up our company / organization. We definitely have entry level jobs across a multitude of disciplines, but we expect our applicants to have some kind of knowledge or craft expertise to benefit us. There is on the job training at Riot, but it's more about teaching new hires about the nuance of working at Riot, rather than teaching them their base skills. Taking engineering as an example, we don't teach new hires how to code/program from scratch. We will however teach them how to code/program at Riot which is very different than coding at a past job. There are also guest speakers and world class peers to help you elevate your programming, but the underlying assumption is that you can do it to begin with.\n\nHope that helps!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Starcraft243ver","date":"2017-04-06T12:28:19.423+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You should ask this directly to a rioter","replies":[{"poster":"RedDownSyndrom","date":"2017-04-06T16:27:49.040+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, i asked in the Help and Support section first.
