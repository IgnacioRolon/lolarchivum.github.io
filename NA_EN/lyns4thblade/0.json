This insta ban system becasue the udyr this game reported me is kinda unfair. I mean sure I said a few things that I wish I could take back but if you saw what he said to me this game and my support blitzcrank I would say i'm pretty okay. I've been playing since season 2 and I have consistently been a pretty positive player. I got a lot of honour today and then this one game when I get reported by someone who was flaming and making the game less fun for everyone (who I tried to stop from flaming btw). and I get a 14 day ban? I put money into this game, and I dont believe it is right to ban me like this without any warning first or anything. Especially if i've had a lot of good games recently. Its like a computer sees a report and sees a certain amount of messages sent and says yup this person deserves a ban?\r\nI dont know about this riot. I think you need to bring back the tribunal banning system or fix this one because if you saw all of the players chat histories in this game mine was by far the cleanest. \r\nI just feel a little gyped. \r\nSo many players dont get banned or punished for their negetive behaviour and this game I clearly tried to help the team realize we could still win. and I tried to stop udyr from flaming and being toxic.

I never got banned in the last 5 seasons. I've always tried to have a  good attitude, with the acception of the occasional bad game. But everyone gets tilted sometimes and honestly if you saw my chat logs for all of my games today, I am a high percentage positive player and try to keep the fun alive when tensions are high in league. (as we all know they can be).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Friendly Ram","date":"2017-11-16T00:36:01.161+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"good luck on getting a red to look at this.","replies":[{"poster":"Lyns4thblade","date":"2017-11-16T00:47:46.170+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thank you.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"forist","date":"2017-11-16T00:49:07.122+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"I agree with ya man, 14 days is way too harsh for a one time offense. I used some offensive language in one of my games yesterday and got the same 14 day ban, so I really do feel your pain. This type of punishment seems quite extreme to me.","replies":[{"poster":"Lyns4thblade","date":"2017-11-16T00:51:34.856+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"I'm glad you agree. Like I said I wouldn't even be opposed to taking a perma chat ban on this account. I just want to play the game. I dont care about chatting I just believe that positive thoughts can help the team moral so I try to always say we can still win and youre doing fine even if I dont think so or if I think its gg\nI know I said \"its gg\" a couple times that game but I was just so fed up with udyr being so toxic all game.","replies":[{"poster":"forist","date":"2017-11-16T00:56:22.343+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"That's admirable, but you really shouldn't have to make concessions when its obvious that something is fundamentally wrong with their new automatic ban system and how quickly it escalates this preseason.
