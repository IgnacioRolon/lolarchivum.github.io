I have changed my password and everything but i can login to the main site and everything looks correct for region and email and everything but i can't log into the support site at all... i did the account recovery and got the automated support ticket reply via email in a language i can't read and its been days and still no response. I can't log into the support site to even check the status of the ticket.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-03-24T04:11:05.530+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like someone may have been on your account and started a region transfer, which would explain why you're not able to login to the NA server anymore. The fact that you filled out a support ticket and got a reply in different language backs this up, as you probably got the reply email in the language of whatever server your account was transferred to.\n\nMy best advice here would be to reach out to us using our [Account Recovery Form](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=72416) so that we can help you get control of your account again!","replies":[{"poster":"Wreyth","date":"2017-03-24T06:07:22.026+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"that was the account recovery form i filled out and got the automated reply in a different language...... been days still no further reply to my email","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-03-24T20:36:04.171+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When you go to the recovery form make sure that you aren't logged in when you submit your ticket. If you submit it while logged in, the ticket will go to the region that the account is on, which is why you're getting responses in a foreign language. If you submit that ticket while signed _out_, the ticket should go to the NA agents.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Wreyth","date":"2017-03-24T06:10:05.725+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"not to mention i cant lose my account i have irreplaceable skins and every champ unlocked ect ect","replies":[]}]}
