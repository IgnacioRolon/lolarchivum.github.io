Tried again it did not work. Then i realized when his defile was on it would stop my ult from bouncing but if it was not on it would bounce.\r\n\r\nHope this can be fixed or was a one game issue.\r\n\r\nThank you","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-02-08T17:53:26.972+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey CaptnKillABro -\n\nThanks for the report!
