So for an idea for balancing Lucian I was thinking of a nerf to his passive.\r\n\r\nHis second shot deals 50% of his AD, and each proc reduces the cooldown to his E, which adds a bit of flavor in gameplay, but one thing that his passive also benefits from is that it does proc on hit effects.\r\n\r\nSo for an idea, in order to make his passive a wee bit more balanced without taking away  from its core usage, I was thinking that the passive doesn't benefit from on hit effects as much as it does with his regular Auto. Its a very subtle change, but reducing the on hit  effects from his passive, [or removing it altogether if needed] would be a subtle change to him that won't affect his core gameplay, but would definitely make sense since his passive double shot is already weaker than his  regular auto attack.\r\n\r\nThoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"ZenonTheStoic","date":"2014-10-08T21:37:38.900+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah, this is on the table.

Or is that a seperate topic?\n\nDue to this ability of the passive damage to crit, Lucian is able to scale well with any stat, as visible in the post 4.10 build shift to Infinity Edge without much loss (if any) of his bullying power.\n\nFor comparison's sake, {{champion:92}} . Kit-wise, she is quite similar to Lucian, as a hardcore AD scaling, mobility focused champion. Her passive, Runic Blade, is fairly similar to Lucian's - it enhances auto-attacks after ability usage. And yet, her passives damage only scales up to 50% of her AD, instead of starting out at that value. And it can't crit, either.\n\nTbh, I am quite a bit frustated with Lucian, as he seems to be able to do so much more on top of his niche as a high-mobility ADC/marksman:\n- His short range doesn't matter as much due to the instant, spammable dash followed up by doubleshot-Q-doubleshot burst.\n- He has good waveclear with Q, W and ulti (which does 400% damage to minions), especially as the AoE of those abilities is rather large and fairly long-ranged.\n- He doesn't scale too badly into lategame, either, with how well all important ADC stats scale on him (on top of the normal auto-attack scaling: AS with ult, Crit with Lightslinger, Bonus AD with Q and Ult).\n- Also, his base AS is quite high, compared to the other ability-focused AD carries ({{champion:104}} {{champion:81}} {{champion:42}} ) with 0.625.\n- Since the Q changes a while back, it is also pretty darn difficult to dodge it.\n\nSorry if this comes over as ranty, I am just frustrated with the champion.","replies":[{"poster":"masterdragon481","date":"2014-10-08T21:55:41.366+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"And she has to be in melee range to apply it.

For AP champions, you've got Nashors + Lich Bane (maybe Wits End), and AD you have BotRK, Trinforce/Iceborn, and (sort of) Statikk Shiv.\n\nI for one would love to see on-hit builds as an alternative to Crit. Build Crit for raw, dumb damage, build onhits for a variety of buff/debuff effects (more items like Trinity Force for example).\n \nUnlikely to happen though.

Yes, this is mixed damage a bit, and yes, I didn't account for resistances.  I also didn't account for penetration or seriously look into lucians actual AD. However, the speed at which this damage comes out is very high; it also essentially sets his attack speed to 2.5. \n\n514.1 damage for 50+60+40=150 mana.  At level 3 lucian has 353 mana, meaning he can do this combo twice, without accounting for regeneration.  \n\nWhen you consider an opponent adc has health around 730, you realize lucian is able to deal around 70% of a targets health for 150 mana.  That is INSANE.  He does this damage very quickly and almost all of it is completely unavoidable (as compared to someone like corki).   \n\nThis demonstration of power only gets more impressive as the game goes on; the mana cost for the combo will decrease, and the potency of it will increase with level and scales VERY well with items, since the passive can crit and can apply onhit effects.  \n\nIn order to actually balance him, his passive needs to only apply when it hits a target with an ability.  This will remove the ability from his E, make dodging his W a larger incentive, and also make avoiding his Q (on those few champions actually able to do it, and even then....) a priority as well.  Note that as long as he hits something, he will get his passive. So with the exception of his E, he shouldn't have a problem getting his passive up in lane, at the very least. In addition, since his E is no longer granting him bonus damage on activation, I would argue that Lucian's E should not have a mana cost.  \n\nThis would drop the total damage done to 89.6+64.5+2(80+40)+80 = 474.1 damage for 110 mana.  I have now also assumed that Lucian hit all his spells.  \n\nI don't know if this solution is the best solution, however this nerf is going to basically do nothing to his performance in lane.  Out of lane, with the mana cost going to zero, it won't matter either.  I realize the champion has no CC, but his wave clear and his damage are simply too strong to compensate.  His damage needs to come down.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sire Hippington","date":"2014-10-10T00:05:10.535+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That would change nothing at all, unless u feel Lucians rushing BotrK are very abusive...\nHe's acctually well balanced now imo, besides maybe the to easy to land poke in lane(Q simply can'T be dodget, it can be missed, but without massive reactions AND flash, u can'T dodge it)\n\nBut if i were to change anything, i would change the passive ad-ratio to scale up on higher ranks(50/55/60/65, increasing on lvl 6/11/16) , but therefor loose the possibility to crit, so he becomes a real ad-caster.\nI've seen so many lucians step into someone and get 4 crits in the passive+q+passive, deleting a squishy from fullhelath.\nBut i've also seen many lucians step in ones face and not crit at all, getting explodet him self in return.\n\nCrit(or rather rng) is just a flawed concept for a competive game, and currently crit is the only viable path for adc...thats imo the most important thing to fix for S5","replies":[]},{"poster":"asamu","date":"2014-10-09T09:12:36.571+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That would do nothing... The only \"on hit\" effect people get is BoTRK, but only some people even build it because BT is better.\nThey should make his passive not reset the auto timer and/or give it a cooldown so that he can't dash->double auto->Q->double auto->E double auto. It's a silly amount of burst damage that he doesn't need given the amount of mobility in his kit and how prone to snowballing he is because of said mobility and burst. It would have little to no effect on his lane burst for short trades with Q->passive, but it would make the damage a bit more manageable if he also used the other abilities, giving other carries a better chance early in the game.","replies":[{"poster":"KzooCrasher","date":"2014-10-09T09:50:14.036+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think you mean W double auto at the end of that but my main problem with your argument is where are you acconting for his range problem and counter play from the enemy ADC or support.
