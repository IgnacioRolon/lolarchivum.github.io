They aren't looked at initially by the Instant Feedback System, but Riot does have records of them and can pull them if needed when reviewing a player. So yes, it is reportable, just make sure that you specify that you are reporting for pre/post game chat. \n\nWith that said, as per the [Universal Rules](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/4LgZ2EwM-universal-rules), we do not allow \"Naming and Shaming\" here on the boards, so I've gone ahead and removed the summoner name from your comment.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ch1mes","date":"2017-03-03T21:06:07.402+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ya sorry I should have mentioned that.
