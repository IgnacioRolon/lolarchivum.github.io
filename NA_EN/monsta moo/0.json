After a certain amount of time passes it seems to work. Until then, like a greedy king, it refuses your pleads.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2017-11-29T22:27:07.357+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh dear. ;-; I've tossed this along to the folks who work on this feature, they're looking into it!","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Sukishoo","date":"2017-11-26T22:45:57.698+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I got that error when I first got it.

After awhile it let me add it. \nThey should really fix this, it happened when I got a emote from a chest too.","replies":[{"poster":"Sukishoo","date":"2017-11-27T02:07:39.272+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah :/ The emote system seems to have a lot of bugs right now.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
