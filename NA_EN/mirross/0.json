If someone in your premade gets an S (S-, S or S+) and you haven't already earned a chest on the champion you're playing, you get the chest.\n\n3) We've got some numbers on this for the PBE deploy but it's definitely something we'll be tuning as we get the system ready for launch. Typically you'll be getting a shard in a chest, sometimes with essence. you can also disenchant shards you don't want for essence.\n\n4) There will be a daily limit on chests. We've considered IP purchase but it won't be there initiatlly.\n\n5) We've built Hextech Crafting as a really flexible system and we expect that we'll be able to add new types of content in future.

If you already play a diverse range of champions, or have friends you play well with, you'll find it easier to earn chests than a solo player who has a narrow champion pool. \n\nKeys are random rewards for winning matchmade games of League of Legends. You can play ARAM, Ranked, Normals etc. The intent here is you play League the way you want, so we'll be tuning with the goal that you'll earn keys at about the same rate regardless of which matchmade queue you are playing in or what champion you are playing. Drop rate is higher with friends, but you won't need to play with friends to earn keys at a good rate.\n\nWhat we're going for with the above is players are rewarded for mastering a diverse range of champions, but players who prefer to play a smaller champion pool can still do most of the time.\n\nI know there are some detailed questions about exactly how chests and key drops work, I'm going to leave that one for RiotSocrates to answer!","replies":[{"poster":"PaladinNO","date":"2016-01-13T22:09:52.150+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":1,"body":"That is a great question indeed, because I've been used to not needing keys. ^^\n\nhttp://www.gamersbin.com/attachments/f137/9063d1312412611-assassin-diablo-2-lord-destruction-wallpaper-assassin-wallpaper-assassin.jpg\n\n---\n\nJokes aside, I haven't read through all of this yet, but as I understand this, we can get keys in every matchmade queue, but only chests on Summoner's Rift, and only if someone on the team gets an S (+/-) performance rating? Or alternatively, the chests can be bought in the store?\n\nNot really sure how to put this without making it sound too negative, so I'll try to do it as gently as I can:\nFirst off, I appreciate this initiative, I really do; we all like free stuff, BUT (and this has already been adressed as \"we're looking into it\", I know), getting these loot chests on only ONE map (when you have 4) does make it feel quite grindy, especially as it's only a limited chance to get what you want. And even a limit on the number of chances.\nAnd that feeling of grindiness is exactly the same argument that was used _against_ the implementation of a sandbox mode. So...I feel there is a contradiction here.\n\nAnd being forced to play on one specific map - and I dont even like SR, personally (to put it this way, I need to talk to your support about purchasing some real estate on the Howling Abyss) - makes me feel forced into playing a part of this game that I don't really want to. \n\nAnd the only reason why I would now play SR, with this feature, would not be for fun, but for the rewards, aka loot, chests, whatever you want to call it. And as I may not, or even probably won't, get what I want within a reasonable amount of time, it is bordering on what I would call unhealthy gameplay.\n\n...\n\nI seem to have a habit of being unable to write short posts, but to do a TL;DR version:\nPlease enable chest drops in every matchmade gamemode, and not just lock them (pun intended) to Summoner's Rift.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Big Durkon","date":"2016-01-13T18:14:40.491+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":2,"body":"Once this goes live, will players receive awards for mastery ranks they have already achieved?","replies":[{"poster":"CrabDust","date":"2016-01-13T19:49:24.824+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"No, but the chests are seasonal.
