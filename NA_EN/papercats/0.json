Basically, my problem is that there's a timed out leaver buster on my PBE account (from when I crashed for some reason and immediately rejoined) that's 1. still there and 2. won't get me into any games. (The longest I've gone until giving up is about 135 minutes) The support has been entirely ineffective and marked my problem as solved TWICE once they sent me something they think would solve the problem from their long list of premade answers. I'm not using my PBE account anymore as it is useless now.\r\n\r\nTL;DR: Riot Support didn't help me whatsoever and now I can't use my PBE account :(","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-19T03:20:26.241+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Some technical issues are a bit more difficult to resolve, which means they can take a longer path of troubleshooting before a solution can be found. I did see the latest ticket requested you to follow up with us in your ticket if you're still having issues, but I was unable to find a record of this being an ongoing issue for 2+ months. I definitely recommend following up on your ticket so we can further troubleshoot this together and find a permanent solution.\n\nIf you have any other questions, let me know.","replies":[]}]}
