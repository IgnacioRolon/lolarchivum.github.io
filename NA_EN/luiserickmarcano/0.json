I have spent over 40+ days out to sea wishing i would be able to play the game by myself, if not just to practice, or play with friends.  I have spoken with many people, and they have said that if there was an offline version of league they could play they_** wouldn't even mind paying for it, myself included.**_\r\n\r\n\r\nI understand that what i am asking is a very difficult task, but if there is a way us servicemen and servicewomen could play the game in remote locations throughout the world, i feel, that it would increase the amount of people playing the game. And your current fans that are active in the community would greatly appreciate the gesture.\r\n\r\non behalf of the gaming community in the armed forces, afloat, overseas, and domestic. Thank you for listening.\r\n\r\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}} \r\nABFAN Marcano Schmilinsky, Luis, E.

That being said, if anyone from Riot is able to see this, please contact me through there. I understand I am not supposed to leave sensitive information here, but once I leave port, well, no internet.","replies":[]}
