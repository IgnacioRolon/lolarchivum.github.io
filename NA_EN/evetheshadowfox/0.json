So naturally I submit a ticket to riot asking about it and apparently the user that gifted it to me had refunded it (which as far as I knew was a breach of their own policy). Anyways the reason my friend had gifted it was I did not have the money for it at the time and I wanted to get it before it was out of the store, in turn a couple weeks later I gifted him a skin as per agreement as payment for my winter wonder karma skin. After explaining this to riot this was their response. &quot;I do apologize for the inconvenience this caused as you explained this was an exchange. However because this isn&#039;t a riot-sanctioned exchange we cannot assist you in this case. &gt;_&lt; Unfortunately, we are not able to reverse or refund gifts at this time. I understand that this may be frustrating, but in the future I recommend only doing these sorts of exchanges with those whom you are close to and trust.&quot; Which ok understandable EXCEPT WAIT, he refunded his gift... Anyways Its whatever I wasn&#039;t too worried about it but I did want my limited time skin back and I had requested to trade skins I currently own OR RP to receive my winter wonder karma skin back. This is their reply, &quot;I definitely understand your frustration, however, if an account is having bank issues then it is possible for content to be removed. As far as exchanging content goes, sadly, we aren&#039;t able to do a trade of sorts in this fashion. In this case, I&#039;d definitely check out this article (https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752944) for more information on limited skins and their availability.&quot; So they basically said even tho you previously owned limited availability content and we removed it from your profile we will not let you get it back (for money or trades) until you wait to purchase it when It comes out in the store in winter. Yet I had already owned the skin and had been using it for over a month... I don&#039;t understand how riot can just tell me to basically go fuck myself and expect me to continue supporting their product.

What do you do?\nYou take back the delivered goods.\nDo you care what he wanted to do with the product? No.\nSometime later, another guy calls, and asks for a product no longer in store.\nDoes that concern you? No, why would it.\n**_That is what happened from Riots point of view_**\n\nYou seem to think they should be concerned because your friend and you had an agreement, and that didn't work out because of a problem on his end. What you don't seem to take into account: **this agreement has nothing to do with Riot  and therefore, they don't need to concern themselves with it.**\nAnd before you say _\"but why wouldn't they give me the skin...\"_ ...Its simply not their responsibility to make sure, a deal between two random people works out, especially not when doing so would go against their own sales strategy (limited availability != available when someone asks for it).\n\nAs far as they are concerned, one guy bought something and couldn't pay, and another guy wanted something when it was no longer available.\n\nThere is nothing \"unfair\" about that.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"69469238DEL1","date":"2017-05-11T13:31:26.971+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your friend isn't much of a friend","replies":[]},{"poster":"AJStarhiker","date":"2017-05-11T21:36:06.596+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the \"can't refund\" policy refers to the limited purchase refunds they allow for people to remove a mistaken purchase (I believe it's 3 refunds per account).  In other words, you can't gift something and then use one of your refunds to cancel it.\n\nChargebacks are a completely different issue.  Sucks that you lost the skin, but doing a chargeback will result in the account getting locked until the money is repayed.  In other words, your \"friend\" lost out on not only the gifted skin, but all access to that account until he pays it back.\n\nAs far as Riot not allowing you to pay for the skin yourself, I'm not sure how that works.  I imagine it's probably something about protecting themselves from scams.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GreatWhiteNorth","date":"2017-05-12T10:35:54.159+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No pic?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Starcraft243ver","date":"2017-05-11T13:55:51.329+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Riot is giving me the finger and I don't now why I should continue playing their game.\n\nThey dont, they just follow their policy, read them carefully next time.","replies":[{"poster":"EveTheShadowFox","date":"2017-05-11T20:26:15.406+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"You mean the policy where you cannot refund gifts...

This sounds unfortunate, but it's not on Riot to break their limited availability skin release structure just because your friend backed out on a deal using a system (the gifting one) for something it isn't the main intent of that system (aka giving skins.  trading is not giving).\n\nRiot is not victimizing you here.
