As for the expiration date, that will not effect how long you have to use the RP you buy. Once you buy any RP, you're free to use it whenever you want. It will never expire or go away.\n\nIf you're looking for a good skin for ol' Kha'Zix, I personally love Mecha Kha'zix and Dark Star Kha'zix. Guardian of the Sands is a really sweet one too!!","replies":[{"poster":"chesterbe","date":"2017-07-10T08:52:34.002+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for replying,you really helped me!","replies":[]}]}]}
