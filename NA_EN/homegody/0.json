He wanted to be a tough guy and he thinks he has some kind of power. He has no power over me and I gave him what he deserved. Seriously the system is f*cked, this isn&#039;t kindergarten this is a game jesus christ. Why would I EVER allow a toxic asshole to have some kind of power over me? The system benefits toxic people so those of us that aren&#039;t toxic get banned so you have nothing but toxicity left. I have NEVER flamed players who are playing badly and/or feeds, never. I only flame people who flame others or me.","replies":[{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2018-08-26T15:00:34.926+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":1,"body":"Defense does not involve repeating what they said or lowering yourself to a standard which would get you punished.\n\nYou have one way to \"defend\" yourself against chat: Mute.
