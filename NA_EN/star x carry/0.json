Does that mean there will be another this year and if not, what dates will the sales begin again?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-04T17:55:35.289+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really don't know the answer to new or upcoming sales beyond what's provided in the [chroma faq](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204475264-Chromas-Packs-FAQ).  I recommend bookmarking our [Sales](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/store/sales) page for any announcements on this and more!

It would be nice to get conformation. Also, if the next sale starts in Feb, will all of the chromas from say January  to all the way back to the first sets of chromas go on IP sale? Like would it include the battle regalia Poppy chromas, the O.G. Zac ones and all of those released in between? Or would it **only** include those that have yet to be purchasable with IP? I'm gonna probably buy a month long IP boost which is equivalent cost of 6 individual chromas and I wanna know if it is gonna be worth it.","replies":[]}]}]}
