It leads to a lot of hooks like Blitz/thresh just jumping 3 or 4 teemos to the left/right it seems just to hit you.\n\nI quit playing a while ago because of the bugs (but I visit the boards to get a tldr of kind of what is going on in LoL from time to time), and just how unfun this game is to play.
