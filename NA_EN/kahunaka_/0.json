If you're going straight to the logon screen, it's the wrong shortcut you're using. You'll find the correct one in C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends (Lol.launcher.admin or something).","replies":[{"poster":"kahunaka ","date":"2016-08-17T14:38:14.440+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Didn't help, but I have Riot Games/lollauncher.admin on my second hard drive.

Always make sure you start the game via the launcher.\n\nThose are the only things i know to prevent this error.","replies":[]}]}
