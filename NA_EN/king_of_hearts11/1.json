How long do you plan on ignoring any advice from Garen mains?","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":44,"down_votes":16,"body":"Okay so just before I start, I want to say I tried the 6.24 changes or &quot;buff&quot; to Garen which has 25% armor shred on his E which was actually nerfed from the initial 35% scaling with levels. \n\n**My question is this:**\n**_What exactly did you accomplish by giving Garen this &quot;buff&quot;?_**\n\nDid it change any of his match ups? **_No_**\nDid it lead to a more dominant laning phase with the shitty base damage on Garen&#039;s E? **_No_**\nDid it give him a means to trade better against almost all of the champions he struggles against? **_No_**\nDid it accomplish E max on Garen again? **_No_**\n\nNow hear me out, Garen has one of the weakest laning phase amongst all champions in top with no real form of sustain which means he gets decimated by champions who have either more means of sustain, burst, or a shield mechanic (the new cheese on every champion from Riot in S7) than him in the early levels. Examples of such champions are Riven, Tryndamere, Renekton, Irelia, Poppy, Trundle, Darius...the list goes on. Its even hilariously sad that **Nasus**, **a champion with a supposed terrible early game** gives Garen trouble in lane with E max unless you run a very specialized rune page on Garen to deal with it._**LOL**_\n\nRight now you literally can not trade with much if any champions in the laning phase _successfully_ considering they will outduel you at any point in the early game due to their kits inherently offering more dueling potential due to sustain or shields except maybe level 6 where you can get a cheese kill with ignite + Ult combo or level 11 when the ticks on Garen&#039;s E start scaling with levels.\n\nTo top it off, Darius literally does **everything** better than Garen at any point so **what is the point of even picking Garen when you have a champion like Darius who is better at every stage of the game and fulfills the same niche?** Like why should any sane player pick Garen over Darius except for the dedicated Garen mains who genuinely enjoy playing a shittier version of Darius?\n\nIts honestly disheartening when you completely ignore the cries of Garen players in higher elo and give him a small &quot;buff&quot; which at some point is going to be completely mediocre approaching into Season 7 and on top of it you nerf it as well by 10%.\n\nTo quote you Meddler, you said something to the effect of we will be toning Garen&#039;s numbers in patch 6.24 as well. In that case I would like to see those Movement Speed nerfs reverted along with the Silence Duration nerfs reverted.\n\nIts absolutely downright disgusting how Garen doesn&#039;t even do well in the match ups he was once supposed to during the multiple nerfs he recieved along with the big hit to the bruiser items. \n\n\n**Keeping all this in mind, I just have a question for you Meddler:**\n\n_**So what is the point of such a mediocre change and what do you think its going to accomplish for Garen?**_\n\n\n\n\n\n**UPDATE: MEDDLER'S RESPONSE**\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=NrIimRFN,comment-id=0007,timestamp=2016-11-28T23:23:02.212+0000)\n>\n> There are a few things we&#x27;re hoping to accomplish by adding a shred to Garen&#x27;s E:\n> \n> 1.

Others however will push for buffs to their favorite champs until those champs are the strongest, or close to strongest, members of their class, without regard for the impact on other champs or the game as a whole.\n\n\n**MY RESPONSE: **\n\nFirst of all I'd like to **thank you** for finally commenting on what direction you plan on taking Garen. It means a lot when you show you actually care about a champion's base of players even from a balance perspective. \n\nCouple of things:\n\nI am in favor of **_moderately_** buffing Garen as long as they are **_significant_** buffs to his gameplay. I am going to quote one of the other players in this thread:\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Critmaster Garen,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=NrIimRFN,comment-id=00010001,timestamp=2016-11-28T17:09:03.454+0000)\n\n>_\" hes at a point, where he deserves a significant buff. **giving him the wrong one seems like a wasted opportunity**. i think there are other changes possible tha would really help him in the long run.\"_\n\nTo put it bluntly I don't want to have to suffer for the entirety of S7 with feeling little to no reward for playing Garen when I could be playing someone like Darius. I am **not** asking for Garen to be at a stage where he's OP. _However_, what I am asking is to be rewarded for picking Garen in some situations feeling like **he excels at something which other champions do not**. \n\nPutting personal feelings aside, Its pretty frustrating playing Garen when you know the other champion i.e. a champion like Darius who will simply offer more at every stage of the game and you can't even outscale him. Does that mean I should simply just not play Garen as long as Darius exists in his current state or what? Its more or less a simple fact that you will lose to him Early, Mid and Late game. I don't think its unreasonable to ask that I should feel as Garen at some point I should feel like I will fare up or do better at some stage. I mean if Darius can exist in such a stage in fulfilling the exact same role **while** having obvious counters, _why can't Garen?_ **Does that mean Darius is now too strong and unhealthy?**\n\nKeeping all this in mind, I suggested _utility buffs_ not _number buffs_ such as reverting back to 2.5 second silence at max level and reverting the 30% movement speed back to 35%. I understand everyone has their own way of looking at the situation judging from the multiple posts and I expect you guys to take the best. I just hope I did my job in bringing to light some major issues which need to be addressed while looking at these changes and move them forward in a _significant_ way rather than offering wasted opportunities which won't be revisited for over a year.\n\n{{champion:86}} ","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2016-11-28T23:23:02.212+0000","up_votes":30,"down_votes":4,"body":"There are a few things we're hoping to accomplish by adding a shred to Garen's E:\n\n1.

I'm one of the high elo garen mains on the NA server.\n\nFeedback on this Change : I agree largely with points 3 and 4.\n\nFor point 2, I disagree that Garen isn't impactful when getting the kills - but this mostly stems from what Garen players choose to build on him. I personally play a much more aggressive style opting for items like Ghostblade, Edge of Night, or crit items. I honestly believe Garen is pitched at being tanky a little too much - a more offensive build really tanks advantage of the damage output he has. His unique ability to crit with his spin means he can build snowball items like Infinity Edge and really run people down, at the cost of being less tanky. Seeing as how killing is his job, it's a shame riot does not encourage Garen players to build slightly more offensively than they currently do. Cleaver rush is a straight up noob trap in most games, where as ghostblade enables him to do his job (hunt carries) significantly better. The point of all this I guess is - Garen should be encourage to only build as tanky as he needs to survive and dump the rest of his resources into damage. Also garen players would love to see more items that can enable effective crit builds on melee heros like garen (atma's crit, + ghostblade crit + infinity edge + triforce were all great crit items for bruisers at one time, now only IE remains and its situationally useful on melees at best - garen/yasuo/trynd/yi/etc)\n\nWhat's Missing from this change :\n\nGaren's real weak point is his early game. It's horrid. It's been bad since the update. This won't do anything to change that.\n\nAlso, E should be garen's encouraged first skill but Q max is his best skill order since juggernaut update. Q gains movespeed duration which is central to the anti-kite he needs, and the damage gained per rank in Q and E are very very similar - early on Q is actually superior unless you get multiple isolated spins on an enemy. Therefore - garen's best damage and utility skill is his Q from level 1 to 10-13~. It's only around 10 that Spin becomes strong enough to want to stay in range for its full duration in trades regularly, and only by 13 does the damage from spin really make it feel like your primary damage skill. The iteration of this change where the %shred scaled gave me a reason to want to max E first again, but now that its 25% flat once more - I have no reason to max E first again. Without making Q weaker (it's his best ability right now and the only one I can really count on early) will there ever be changes to E to make it his primary skill once more?\n\nthanks","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2016-11-29T02:00:43.235+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":2,"body":"Thanks for the feedback. With you that this still leaves Garen in a rough spot in a number of early game match ups. A shred will add a bit of power there, but not enough to shift many cases to an appropriate spot. We're not expecting this to solve all of Garen's issue by itself. \n\nOn a similar note would also agree it'd be good to see Garen want to max E more. Scaling Armor Shred was intended to push him in that direction, we ultimately concluded we wanted it starting higher and capping out lower though. I'd imagine at some point we'll want to either buff E and/or shift power from Q to E. \n\nRegarding the items we push on Garen (assuming you're talking Recc items) that generally reflects what we believe will give players new to LoL and/or Garen a good starting experience. Where we have to choose between one or the other we'll usually favor 'these items help you learn to play the champion and do ok' over 'these items are harder in your first games and you may have a rough time if you do it wrong, but they'll be great choices once you know what you're doing'.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheMoobile","date":"2016-11-30T02:56:04.509+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"I'm sorry, I have to disagree with your comments about Q.\nEspecially \"E\" not being a skill that gets maxed, E is quite a decent damage skill at the moment and thus it is the MOST POPULAR skill to max.

Others however will push for buffs to their favorite champs until those champs are the strongest, or close to strongest, members of their class, without regard for the impact on other champs or the game as a whole.\n\nGaren's E buff is just a somewhat worse version of Darius' passive on E (since Darius' passive is up all the time). I see you guys are really sticking to Garen's identity as \"a shitty version of Darius\".\n\nOh sure, it gives some cute armour reduction for the other AD champions on your team, but the problem with trying to give Garen a teamfight-oriented buff is actually pretty simple: _Garen is bad at teamfighting_. He is possibly the single worst juggernaut at team fighting except maybe an Illaoi with the wrong comp or Udyr. Maybe Yorick too. \n\nYou're balancing Garen around a high-end that he has no means of actually achieving, by giving him less reliable power (though in this case the power isn't even particularly powerful). Remember the last time Garen was given unreliable power as a substitute for having some reliability? He was given the Villain mechanic, which has such an obnoxious high end that his numbers were gutted so his more general power suffered.\n\nHe needs to have some actual damage and steroids in his kit that aren't unreliable gimmicky bullshit, and then he needs to have the Villain mechanic thrown in the dumpster where it belongs. Tailor his identity around being a duelist juggernaut, without Darius or Illaoi's potential for big boy AOE team fight damage, but dealing incredible damage in his short radius. I agree that he should be more target agnostic, more than most other juggernauts. I'd like to see him be made into a juggernaut with a side of skirmisher, who doesn't deal huge burst and doesn't have much in the way of range, but is a hard nut to crack and deals heavy sustained damage to tanks and squishies alike.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Belharion","date":"2016-11-29T00:08:34.872+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":4,"body":"Any comment on removing the crit chance from his E and giving him power elsewhere?

It means a lot when you show you actually care about a champion's base of players even from a balance perspective. \n\nCouple of things:\n\nI am in favor of **_moderately_** buffing Garen as long as they are **_significant_** buffs to his gameplay. I am going to quote one of the other players in this thread:\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Critmaster Garen,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=NrIimRFN,comment-id=00010001,timestamp=2016-11-28T17:09:03.454+0000)\n\n>_\" hes at a point, where he deserves a significant buff. **giving him the wrong one seems like a wasted opportunity**. i think there are other changes possible tha would really help him in the long run.\"_\n\nTo put it bluntly I don't want to have to suffer for the entirety of S7 with feeling little to no reward for playing Garen when I could be playing someone like Darius. I am **not** asking for Garen to be at a stage where he's OP. _However_, what I am asking is to be rewarded for picking Garen in some situations feeling like **he excels at something which other champions do not**. \n\nPutting personal feelings aside, Its pretty frustrating playing Garen when you know the other champion i.e. a champion like Darius who will simply offer more at every stage of the game and you can't even outscale him. Does that mean I should simply just not play Garen as long as Darius exists in his current state or what? Its more or less a simple fact that you will lose to him Early, Mid and Late game. I don't think its unreasonable to ask that I should feel as Garen at some point I should feel like I will fare up or do better at some stage. I mean if Darius can exist in such a stage in fulfilling the exact same role **while** having obvious counters, _why can't Garen?_ **Does that mean Darius is now too strong and unhealthy?**\n\nKeeping all this in mind, I suggested _utility buffs_ not _number buffs_ such as reverting back to 2.5 second silence at max level and reverting the 30% movement speed back to 35%. I understand everyone has their own way of looking at the situation judging from the multiple posts and I expect you guys to take the best. I just hope I did my job in bringing to light some major issues which need to be addressed while looking at these changes and move them forward in a _significant_ way rather than offering wasted opportunities which won't be revisited for over a year.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DCYOUNG888","date":"2016-11-28T23:40:05.118+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"How is Mordekaiser's state right now in the preseason?","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2016-11-29T02:08:43.983+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":5,"body":"He's not on our radar yet at least, though we'll be giving him and a lot of AP champs a look after 6.24.

Any buff is certainly most appreciated and welcomed but his damage department is fine for the most part. His struggles are elsewhere.\n\nHe definitely needs his stats to be upped; the gutting of his HP and HP scaling gutted his early game, making it very easy to fall behind. Scaling to late game is good and all (Judgement max spins and therefore dmg, passive starts really doing work, Courage lasting more etc) but not all games reach there; many are decided long before that. By stats alone, Darius is a far better damage dealer AND tank than Garen (level 18) :( Garen is a better tank while W is active but that's just about it. And Rito's official statement was \"We don't want a game where champion X is better than champ Y at all things Y does so you won't have a reason to pick Y over X.\" Currently, many do that to Garen...:/\n\nHis passive could definitely be looked at. I liked how it got buffed but early on, it's not much use-you must sit away from combat a lot to regen, which will cost you cs/get you behind. Many have the in-combat sustain which leaves you at a disadvantage. When it kicks to overdrive you really see the difference but anyone who meets the requirement's with Warmogs essentially gets a max power Garen passive for free again bringing him on the losing end (it's pretty much a 'winmore' item on him). A not OP and not changing much change could be to make it so that you get the full heal from passive when you activate W and it cannot be interrupted/stopped for the duration (until we can come up with something better).\n\nQ seems fine as is (although the nerfs to ms bonus it gives and base ms made Garen the easiest champ to kite or of the most easiest at least). What you could do with it would be to make it into some form of a gap closer; every new champ which has the same role (and not only) with Garen gets that- more disadvantages he has to compete with.\n\nW was hideously nerfed in juggernauts patch. A % bonus of armor/mr coming from everything (items, runes, masteries) gave you huge value the moment you leveled the ability and made every defensive item that much more worth on Garen. The measly flat 30 bonus isn't something great imho (which you need cs to achieve). I also don't understand why it should be capped; Sion has no cap, Veigar has no cap, Bard has no cap, Nasus has no cap. I don't think it's that OP, especially since it comes in lame doses of 0.25/creep. Also, removal of tenacity hurt a lot; Garen WANTS to absorb cc for his team. The \"we don't like/think built in tenacity is healthy\" justification didn't quite cut it imho (Irelia's passive still stronger version that's ALWAYS up and the recent change didn't do much to end the frustration she creates as a champ). Idk, it needs to be changed a lot imho, just keep the core essence- reduced % dmg taken.\n\nE is ofc his trademark and iconic ability, the original and still best spin2win in the game, wouldn't want it to change ofc; except maybe a few things. I don't like how, at some points, someone can just sit there, auto attacking you and do more damage than a full E on his face, especially in early levels. That's why many max q first now (bigger ms and for more time) since e also scales with champion level. Also, \"Judgement can crit for bonus damage\" but what items for crit are you expecting Garen to build? IE-which was nerfed, then buffed (a little) but still very expensive? Or any of the Zeal items (RFC and PD could be nice but still not optimal)? Youmuu's was neat but they removed crit chance from it. That's why you put 1 crit chance rune in the page and pray to RNGesus. You could make it so each subsequent tick you land does increasingly more damage (reward for sticking to target). Maybe increase its range a bit.\n\nR should also remain as is- or Rito could do us a favor and make it AD scaling at long last. Villain mechanic does seem fitting thematically but the bad thing is that it is very unpredictable (supports or anyone you shouldn't be focused on killing gets it). On the other hand, if the one you should go for is enemy adc and you can already 100-0 it without it then again, it's not much help. Considering this was the 'counter-balance' for Garen's nerfs, it doesn't seem that OP. What they could do maybe is giving the ult reduced cd if you manage to kill the Villain/give a recast time window if you execute the Villain (that would make him very Darius like ofc..). Or when you successfully kill the Villain, get a buff that gives E increased range and damage and cd reset on kill.\n\nYou've said that you want to \"keep Garen a beginner-friendly champ\" and this kinda ruins the hopes of a potential bigger rework... You don't want Garen being able to make plays/used at competitive level? If you look at the Battle Training you have Ashe, Ryze and Garen- 3 'beginner' champs, each considered the easiest for his role. Ashe had to be nerfed, Ryze is having a resurgence, both are prevalent in the highest levels of play. Poor ol' Garen? Struggles in obscurity... I believe you can find a middle ground where you can 'modernize' his kit up to today's standards while keeping him beginner-friendly.\n\nP.S.

To get the big defensive masteries he'd have to go 9/0/21. \n\nDo you know how much MR Garen's old W passive would get you with the current masteries in place if you took standard MR runes? Three.\n\nEquivalent to having about twelve CS, which shouldn't be hard to have by level three. \n\n> For example, I was at 52/51 armor/mr. This, along with the gutting of HP and HP scaling is what made Garen pathetically weak early game.\n\nWrong, it is strictly superior in the early to mid game. Getting armour and MR without having to build any (as opposed to the old W passive which required it to be built or taken to get any use) means you can more readily rush HP, increasing your effective HP more than armour alone would do. \n\n> A plain +30 is lame- any completed armor item gives more or equal (Ninja Tabi) at worst- plus, you gained the bonus %.\n\nNinja tabi with the current iteration of his W gives you 60 total armour.\n\nNinja tabi with the old iteration gives you 36. \n\nOnce again, you need 150 bonus armour and MR to exceed the current stacked value, which rarely happens for MR and only happens in the late game with armour.\n\n> Only with Knight&#x27;s Vow you&#x27;d be at a loss but that&#x27;s something you&#x27;d rarely consider building (if ever). If it didn&#x27;t have a cap, we might had something, but currently, it&#x27;s a joke (also lost tenacity).
