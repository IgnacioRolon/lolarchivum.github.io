It gets better, worse, or unchanged every patch. I haven't seen the get better slope in so long that I didn't bother playing ranked this year.   I considered it may have been my 6 yr old q6600 with a 980gtx with some windows 10 on a ssd with various issues thrown in. That was until 30 min ago when my just finished being built ryzen 7 1800x with nvme drive with the windows 10 1607, 32 gigs of ram and a 1080 ti ftw3 that just blew through benchmarks at ultra settings....struggled to maintain anything near 100fps. I actually dropped tp 40 a few times. I knew i should have gone with a threadripper.","replies":[]}]}]}
