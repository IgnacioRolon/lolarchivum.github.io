I really don't care about the ban. My problem however is that I got banned, while in queue. I was in my promo series so I lost my promos and 10 LP because of the ban. Since there isn't anyone reviewing a ban, it should be instantaneous if its going to happen. Its absurd to ban someone mid queue and punish them because you allowed them to queue. If you get banned mid queue, why does it still count as a dodge?","replies":[{"poster":"rujitra","date":"2020-01-19T18:48:07.807+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Because you still dodged.
