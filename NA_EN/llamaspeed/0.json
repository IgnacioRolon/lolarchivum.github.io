Go look at the threads from back when Azir was on the PBE, and you will find PLENTY of threads talking about the EXACT issues he went to live with.\n\nRiot ignored us, because they wanted to push him out with the Shurima event. Then when he was released, they finally went \"oh hey, problems\" and all of us PBE testers facepalmed, and cared a little bit less the next time.\n\nPBE should be more than testing new champs, but Riot cares so little to actually listen to feedback that most people (like me) have given up trying completely to give feedback. Hell I uninstalled the PBE from my comp because what is the point? Last thing I seriously tested was the leaverbuster system, and Lyte ignored half of what I gave as feedback (and many others too).

That is exactly what they are doing, though. They are seeing a vision of where they want this game a year down the line, or even 5 years down the line. They are not using short-sightedness to guide their vision into the future. The future for them is far further than the week it'll take for people to adjust to any new changes they make.\n\nI see a lot of crying. I see a lot of \"change X suck balls\". I see a lot of \"such and such is cancer\". I see a lot of \"Rito ruined the game, I quit\". If you go into every decision they make with a knee-jerk, \"Oh my god the sky is falling\" mentality, you may as well pack up shop and find a different game. That's just like telling the guy in top lane after he's died a second time in 10 minutes \"GG, we lose\". Everyone talks about the \"toxic community\" in their games, but these boards aren't any less toxic and counter-productive some days.\n\nUltimately, this is Riot's product, a product that they want to be successful. They're not making choices within the game to ruin your life. They didn't look at their player base of their FREE TO PLAY game and say \"we have too many people playing, let's get rid of a couple hundred thousand by making wholesale changes that will destroy what we built\". They genuinely want to build something that lasts and you really have to have more faith in them than that. If you don't have that faith, don't invest your money into their product. If you don't have a belief that these employees want to keep their jobs and improve a great game, keep your money and invest it into something you do believe in.\n\nChange isn't always good, but change is inevitable. Riot isn't ignoring people or dismissing your opinions when they move content from the PBE to live. They have cancelled several ideas that they have had after it hit the test phase and didn't work the way that they wanted it to. But I am willing to bet that as Riot employees, the Reds have been instructed by their bosses to not post anything in regards to new changes and these rampant flame posts that litter the boards. There's no reason to fuel the fire when the answer they give you as to why things change will never be the \"Sorry, we'll change it back right away\" answer that you all want. Instead, they'd rather let the community flame and attack them while they monitor and assess where they should be putting their resources in making the game better on the whole.\n\nEvery day, I look forward to seeing what new and exciting changes Riot has on the horizon for what this game could be. There isn't a single game out there right now that brings as much free content to their community. New champions, new game modes, and new events (like Shurima and Bilgewater) keep the game fresh and still FREE. Yes, they introduce elements of each event that can only be experienced through the purchase of real money, but much of the content you can experience without spending a single cent.\n\nIn the end, I have put plenty of money into this game. I have done so with little regret. It's better than spending full value on a game for my console and putting it up to collect dust a month later when I have finished it off. Instead, I have the ability to log in each day, interact with a generally fun community, and put my skills to the test in a very solid game. This is a game that from week to week, I never know what opportunity I might get to enjoy. Next week I might have to re-evaluate my item choices with a patch re-balancing my favorite champion's toolkit. Or maybe I get a chance to try out a new or reworked champion that becomes my new favorite. Maybe I'm just an optimist, but at the end of the day, I would much prefer to embrace the inevitable change of a game that has provided me over two years of challenging gaming fun and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future.","replies":[{"poster":"Binxy Prime","date":"2015-07-23T15:29:02.067+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While I don't really agree with a lot of what you said I think you did do a very good job of explaining things from their side.

I agree that the new Hud was a little jarring at first, and will take time to get accustomed to.

Riot has a good operating procedure for this scenario.\n\nStep 1: Make sure the champ isn't broken.\nStep 2: Buff to viability.\n\nThat's a GREAT way to do things. To expect that they will nail it on the first try every time is absolutely ridiculous. The older I get, the more I appreciate how difficult it is to make systems like this work. The only people I see that think it should be easy are people that are too young to appreciate what a real, live workplace looks like, and/or have never tried to create anything on their own.\n\nRiot employees argue just as much as we argue here. It's a miracle this game works even half as well as it does. It's remarkably balanced, and the turnaround on realizing the flaws is very fast. I remember the days when games couldn't patch at all. This is much better.
