Here is why:\r\n____\r\n\r\n\r\nRank is supposed to show how far you have come as an individual in the game. As much as we would hate to admit it, we always see players skill mostly through their rank. For example, we would much rather have a diamond player on our team than a bronze 5 player. This is of course, understandable because to our eyes the diamond player is much more experienced. This is ok, in fact the system of having ranks such as gold plat diamond, that system is fine. However, the system of how you&#039;re supposed to GET to those ranks is completely and utterly wrong and frankly, outdated.\r\nLet&#039;s take the example of tests in school. All of us know that these teachers can not determine our actual knowledge solely on tests. I remember reading an article the other day where the author wrote something interesting. He said, &quot;How are we supposed to understand the level of knowledge in our children when the level of knowledge we are teaching them is how to take tests.&quot; He continued by stating, &quot;If we are teaching our children to take tests, then how are they going to be ready for the real world? We should be teaching them how to sustain a lifestyle, not how to get an A+ on a piece of paper.&quot; (Please note that these are rough interpretations from my own memory as i could not find the official source) \r\nI could not agree more with his notion, and with that system in place, children are not being taught how they should and want to be. Now then, if we were to take that same example, and apply to ranked matches, we would have a similar case. Before i continue i do want to state that League of Legends is definitely and without a doubt a team driven game, however the word &#039;team&#039; only reaches so far to many people. **It comes to a point where your &#039;team&#039; was a sole reason you went down in rank, or, in the same sense, went up in ranked.**\r\n\r\nI believe that your rank should be based on YOUR level of skill, rather than mostly other teammates. Of course, in a team 5v5 ranked match, all numbers should be calculated as a whole. However, when it comes to solo que ranked, numbers NEED to be arranged in a different manner, only because the rank at hand, belongs to a certain individual. That is the word isn&#039;t it... **Individual**... that will be the main idea of my argument here, that will be the word that brings all my ideas together.\r\n___\r\n**Solo que**: You take on the task of being paired with people you know nothing about. All you have are your first impressions on them and that&#039;s it. You don&#039;t know what kind of life they&#039;ve had, or what they have been through, but that is what it is. What you depend on is trying to work with these people to secure a win, why? Because your rank depends on it. Most of the time, and definitely NOT always, you take on an artificial friendship for these people JUST to get on their good side, and JUST to keep them happy, keep them focused, in the sole hope that you can get them to play their best. You fear the moment one of them begin to argue, you fear the moment the peace you tried so hard to sustain is broken because of one of them dying. You fear THE MOST, one of them becoming a troll, or going afk, because it is at that moment, you know you lost that match, or rather, YOU didn&#039;t lose that match, that person did, for everyone. Everyone suffers the consequence that SHOULD have been bestowed on the one who deserved it. In the end, you suffered for the actions of someone else, and that should never happen.\r\n\r\nWe have an excellent system implemented to our game recently, the champion mastery system. Our performance with our champion is taken and transformed into a Letter, a letter that shows us how much farther we have gotten, or need to go. Because getting an S+ with a champion, gives you the feeling of &#039;i did it&#039;. I believe this system should have been taken, and in-cooperated heavily in the ranked system. You wouldn&#039;t want to be arrested because you were with someone who shot another person, because you didn&#039;t do it, he did. In the same sense, you shouldn&#039;t be stuck in bronze/silver/gold/plat because someone else decided to screw you over, you were innocent, you did not deserve to get punished. Because in the end, our rank should be a manifestation of our OWN performance, because in the end, we are **Individuals** and we should not be calculated based on the actions of others. \r\n\r\nThank you for reading...","replies":[{"poster":"jaymc1130","date":"2015-08-02T20:35:19.869+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with this post 100%, the system is in dire need of revision.

If you lost the game but went 17/3/7, you shouldn't lose 17-22 points purely because you lost.  If you won but went 1/11/6, you shouldn't still gain a bunch of points purely because you won.  It just makes it needlessly harder to at the very least maintain your rank if you have a string of bad games and easier to just have a platinum smurf friend carry you out of your rank.

They're not in every game, but they're still relatively common.  (At a conservative guess, I'd say that about ~10% of games are decided by toxicity instead of skill - since there are highly toxic players in roughly 20% of games.)\n\nIn order for matchmaking based on win/loss to work, then skill and teamwork need to be the only factors which decide the outcome of the game.\nFor every game which is decided by a single toxic player, turning what should have been a win for a team into a loss for that team, the matchmaking system becomes slightly less aligned.\nThis means that sometimes a player may end up significantly higher or lower than they belong.   In turn, that can cause two things:\n\n - A game where one player plays much worse than everyone else.\n - A game where one player plays much better than everyone else, potentially stomping on the enemy team.\n\nThis can lead to more undeserved wins/losses because of the skill gap, but also increases frustration for the other players in the game, possibly leading the to those players being more likely to be toxic in their next game because of the bad experience, which in turn disrupts even more of the matchmaking.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LlamaSpeed","date":"2015-08-03T00:36:17.720+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For those who are gravely mistaken:\nMany are neglecting this post due to my own rank, Bronze 2.
