There are a variety of reasons you can take someone's advice, especially when you yourself can admit that you don't know (and can't possibly know) everything about the game. I'm personally more than willing to take any advice I can get on any champion or role so long as the person doing it knows more than I do and/or has some semblance of credibility. This person can be less mechanically skilled or less knowledgeable overall than I, but if they play a specific champion or role more than I do, then there's a pretty good possibility they know something I don't that might be useful.\n\nBut of course, this would require people to be reasonable, respectful individuals on the internet.

My MMR isn't \"significantly better\" due to the simple fact that I barely play ranked. If you don't play ranked you don't rank up, it's a very simple concept. \n\nI'm \"that guy\" you're referring to because my understanding of macro level play due to having spent _hundreds of hours_ watching the game played by pro players makes me the smartest guy in the room by default. That **doesn't** mean I'm the best at my champion or role, but I know what needs to get done, and it's certainly difficult to get that done when everyone else on my team who thinks they \"know everything and don't need help\" refuses to consider that maybe they _do_ in fact need a gameplan. \n\n> Second, in the two years I have been playing league, I have never witnessed a situation where \"coaching\" in a game turned the game around.

This idea is kinda the opposite of what Riot has made.  The raging players who blame and insult their teammates get ignored, while the victims get punished by the automated system.  Riot says the system isn't automated right now, but the only way that is true is if it's being run by people who care about customers even less than their support staff does.  \n\nWhat Khurby says is sadly true and most of the trolls have figured this out.  They also know that Riot refuses to figure out how to take pregame logs, so they will constantly troll as hard as they can, saying the most hateful things they can think of.  When you get into the game and someone is on tilt due to the horrible(yet ignored by Riot) pregame, the guy who's on tilt gets reported and punished by the troll, his duo partner, and anyone he can convince from the enemy team.   The system has been reduced to nothing more than another tool for griefers, and when you point out its flaws to Riot, they just lie about it and swear it's infallable.  They don't care that its busted.  They seem to actually want this game to become fully populated with trolls, griefers, and raging sociopaths.\n\nAnother, somewhat smaller, crowd in this problem area are the players who simply refuse to listen to anyone no matter what.  I've been reported in countless games for simply asking people to do things like group and play safe(not being mean, and in some of them I'm trying waaay too hard to be nice to obvious trolls).  Some of these kids just instantly gang up on people who type in full sentences and try and make them stop and think about anything.  You know what's great about that?  All it takes is two of them with this mentality and you can actually get warned or punished for this thanks to the wonderful \"non-automated\" system.\n","replies":[{"poster":"LGBTCute","date":"2015-07-07T17:19:22.253+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"The only upside to all this is that's the \"false positives\" are coming so fast and furious that the community in general is beginning to realize what is happening.
