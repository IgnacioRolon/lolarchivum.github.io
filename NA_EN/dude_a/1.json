So i click the restart now button and the downloader comes up to download the patch (~200mb? i think). But then the download stopped at, 200mb/200mb downloaded, I wait about 5- 10 mins but its still stuck on this so i decide to close it and relaunch League. It gives me the same update message and i go ahead and let it download again. It gets stuck at 100% again and even after 20-30min wait its still stuck. So i close and and try it again but this time the client is trying to redownload the whole game? It says Downloading|Game and is downloading about 3.5GB of data. At this point i am just letting the download go. But is this the client not being able to find my game files anymore and trying to download it somewhere else? Or is this new patch just this big? Anyone else having this problem?[](http://imgur.com/TTi1iMv)","replies":[{"poster":"BrxGaming","date":"2017-10-25T07:03:08.833+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i downloaded the game and its downloading again{{item:3151}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"DECTATOoOR","date":"2018-03-07T15:27:10.148+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"SAme here now omg! {{summoner:21}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"RoyaLFortun3","date":"2017-10-09T12:00:54.731+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im having this exact problem now, my game was patching on every startup so i uninstalled and reinstalled andnow ive got this nonsense, my eta is 3500+ minutes, honestly what is this?

After interrupting the download a few times, the download file got bigger to compensate for any files that became corrupted or damaged when you were closing the update. Wait for that download to finish, and let the update process finished as well. After that, if you run into any errors, I'd suggest running an update through the client or by using our [**Hextech Repair Tool**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367-Automated-Troubleshooting-Hextech-Repair-Tool).","replies":[{"poster":"Celeste Benal","date":"2017-08-06T17:25:29.158+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I also have this problem of a 3.5GB download. Except I have not done any of the things this person did. Start the game and all of a sudden 3.5GB download. Are you kidding me? I've never had to down load so much. I really don't have 4 hours to wait on this.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MageShroom","date":"2017-07-27T07:50:23.587+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same problem with the last patch {{item:3073}} {{champion:103}} {{item:3073}}","replies":[]}]}
