Maybe there could be some other solution, as in simply lowering the damage on the skill or anything else cuz now it changes the way the champ is supposed to be played completely. Looking at it another way, Katarina's \"w\" and auto procs her q mark, remove that and the w becomes somewhat useless.","replies":[{"poster":"GaleWinUnleashed","date":"2015-03-12T03:32:23.423+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You realize that interaction was added last year when Akali needed a buff, right?

Her E began procc'ing her Q on July 7, 2012 with the same patch that brought in Jayce. lol.

It was added because she's got hugely clunky abilities that have almost no flow together. If she E's or R's, she can't do anything else for a good half second or more after it's dealt damage. Since they weren't very good with models back then, they just made her E proc her Q... Now it doesn't proc her Q and she still has the exact same burst potential, but now she's back being more clunky than Karthas' old auto attack. lol.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Stonington","date":"2015-03-12T03:31:43.755+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, the range nerf was probably enough to cripple her.

I feel like nerfing her passive would've been a better direction or at most the detonation damage on her Q.. anything but removing her combo. Basically what i want to know is, how does E fit her kit? How does it mesh with the other 3(4withpassive) abilities? Its just a random physical AoE ability.. lol","replies":[]}]}
