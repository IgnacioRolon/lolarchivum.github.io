Sometimes, When i click on the league icon, the client doesn't launch. I tried again and again. Sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't. Then I need to unisntall the whole files of league of legends. Then reinstall again. It takes me to four hour to install the files again and update the client. Now i need to upgrade alpha client because of this new patch. Once the real client finishes its updating, new client start to upgrade. It's showing right now \"upgrading your client 1034 MB (430KBps)\" which means i need to wait 1 and half hours more in order to finish this progress. Total 5 hr and 30 mins.\r\nDoes it even make sense? I need to wait that long just to install a game then upgrade?\r\nRiot should work on it. Just fix this bug or give solution for not launching the client even when click on the league icon.\r\nThank you!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-19T22:00:44.254+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You could be having a permissions issue, where either your OS or some program setting changed and not allowing the updated client to launch properly.
