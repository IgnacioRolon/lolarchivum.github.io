I've read the Riot Support article about Hextech Crafting and I have a question about key shards.\r\nI know that I have a chance to get a key shard if I win a game. I want to know if I can get key shard drops if I win with a champion I do not own.\r\n\r\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-03T18:39:13.098+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Currently, you'll need to play on a champion that you own to receive a key fragment.  I don't have any information if that will be changed in the forseeable future, but that's the current requirement.
