However, getting put in low priority queue after being afk for 8 minutes (bugsplat. Honestly, there should be a thing that detects bugsplat so that you don't get punished for it) just once is a bit extreme. Once can easily be a mistake. Why not make it after two or three offenses? Next time this happens, I'm not even going to reconnect. I'll probably just go play so overwatch or something, since reconnecting won't help me at all. Just make me play a stressful game with people raging at me for 30 minutes.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-08T01:16:30.500+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel ya buddy, almost all of us have been there at some point tbh. Even if you disconnect from something out of your control, it doesn't change the fact that your teammates were left to try and win that match without you.

It took me like forever to load a game and often i would make me come in game 2, or 3 or 4 minutes late. I would then finally get into the game, and the funniest part was that then i would get the message that says something like \"not moving for more than 3 minutes is considered afk\" and then i would get automatically outlogged from the game, just to have to reconnect once more to then get to play. If you're poor and don't got the best PC/ Mac, you will get punished more often than if you would have the youtube moneyzz to play on an alienware.","replies":[]}]}
