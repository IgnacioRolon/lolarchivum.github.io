It was an awesome experience, I played it because my brother got me to play, he got our whole family \"15\" to play, it was intense. Playing pvp for the first time, I went 5 and 16! \"Yes I know its bad\" But it was awesome for me, the people were nice and courteous. Got to level 30 in a matter of 3 weeks, and met tons of people. I played ranked for the first time and it caused me to rage quit LoL, They were so mean they caused me to be toxic back and I decided it was time for a break. But off that subject. I came back recently because I felt it was time to play again, Lots of new updates. My favorite champ, yasuo was nerfed alot but I learned how to cope. I met tons of people, including my first ever rioter today, She was so nice to me! KateyKhaos is da best xD.             I can't wait for the arcade miss fortune to come out, i saw the looks for it.. It will be mine >:C {{item:3070}} {{champion:21}} {{item:3070}} \r\n\r\n\r\nAnyway guys, that is my small leaugue life, my ingame name is GenericPop and this was my first experience with the Boards, Hope to meet some fantastic people! :D","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2014-08-11T06:55:20.151+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"It was nice meeting you! \n\nYou seemed to have had better luck starting out than I did, haha. Annie was my first, and I had no idea she had a stun, nor how do get the stun. \n\nRanked is definitely more intense than normals. There's a couple things I'd recommend to help you have a better ranked experience, should you want to give it another go.\n\n1. **Play ARAM!** Seriously, ARAM will allow you to play various champions you've never played (and you'll get better at playing them!) On the other hand, you'll also learn how to fight against all the champions. This will help you learn your limits as various champions, what carious champions do, how they combo, and learn how long their cooldowns are. I improved significantly as a ranked player from just playing ARAM.\n\n2. **Learn several roles.** This one's really important. Going into ranked only knowing how to play one champion can be rough ~ What happens if they get banned? What happens if someone takes your role? To feel more comfortable in ranked, I'd recommend being \"good\" at three lanes, whichever those end up being. I'd also learn at least three champions in each of those roles, for the same reason as I've previously mentioned ~ bans! Yes, this will take time, and yes, you're not going to be great with all three roles right away, but give it some time. Play some normals. Play draft to get in the swing of how picks / bans work.\n\n3. **Communicate with your team.** I can't stress this enough. There's nothing worse than having no communication in champ select, and then having two people fight over ADC. Talk to your team! Tell them which roles you're best with, and even who you'd like to play. Don't be afraid to say there's a role you don't know how to play, or don't play well. I often say that I can't jungle. It's best to be honest, than to have someone rage because you accepted a role you couldn't hold up to. If someone picks your role, or isn't willing to swap, that's okay. I've had to go top before, and that's not my best lane. I simply told them I'd do my best, but it's not my strongest lane. Ask for tips if you need them. Your team will most likely be happy to tell you what to build / how to counter your opponent than have you dive in blindly and feed your lane. \n\nHope that helps a bit. Like I said, it can be super intimidating, but with some practice, it's nothing you can't take on.","replies":[{"poster":"Kao Atlantis","date":"2014-08-11T07:09:21.029+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love your feedback, it is very valuable advice. I would just add twos things to point 3 if you don't mind...\n\n1. If someone on your team is raging, or otherwise being toxic in the chat, learn to use mute or ignore. The stress levels go down if you don't have to worry about people yelling at you (or other people) in the game. I have a really hard time playing when people are raging, even if it's not targeted towards me, and this helps a lot. \n\n2. Something else that helps, is when you notice someone isn't doing well, encourage nicely them to keep trying, everyone has bad games, and you can always turn it around. Boosting people's ego with friendly words wins more games, and helps stop people from getting frustrated and raging, or AFKing.\n\nJust my 2 cents to add. :D\n---\n\n{{champion:21}} \nAlso Miss Fortune is my favorite, Arcade MF HYPE! I am glad you love this game GenericPop, it truly is unmatched in replayability.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2014-08-11T18:52:55.734+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I totally agree ~ don't feed the trolls. \n\nThere's been plenty of times my ADC gets killed, and they apologize. I tell them not to worry 'cause one or two deaths isn't the end of the game. It usually helps your team to not get tilted if you tell them it's not a big deal that they made an off-play, or died 'cause they didn't see a gank coming. Also, helping people realize what they did wrong is also super helpful. Of course, some take it better than others. At that point, I try to help where I can. I main support, so if I see mid getting ganked, and they're still not warding, I'll help by tossing a ward near their lane.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Paying bills","date":"2014-08-11T07:01:39.327+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well thank you, you're really kind to give me advice about the game, I will keep this in mind going into games and I love arams!

Took a little over 3 monthes to hit 30. \nI read Ire's skills from minute one so I knew how her slow/stun worked but couldn't figure out the rest except for her ult, kinda. Learned to hate Darius and Teemo whenever I fought (because a lot of people played Darius because he was new and would crush me and Teemo was, well, Teemo). Put points in Q,W,E in order until i could put one in ult and just went that way for much longer than I'd like to admit. The game grew on me and I stuck to it and very happy I did. I've got friends who play, and made more by playing. \nAt the end of season 2, I picked up Riven and bought Redeemed as a skin, then made the mistake of ignoring the Championship skin because I \"Had a skin already and didn't like the look of her sword in ult\". Whoops! Though, still don't think I'd use it much for those same reasons (still would've been nice to have).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Stephenizgod","date":"2014-08-11T08:27:54.194+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"haha my first actual game (not customs) was terrible! i was so baaaad AND IM STILL SO BAAAAAAD!!!!
