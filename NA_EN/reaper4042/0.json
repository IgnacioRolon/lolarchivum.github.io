Every board comment just says you probably suck just get better, and I have my k/d ratio is always at least 1/1 in auto fill and if I jg it&#039;s about 3-4/1.

You kill, thats all. This guy is Bronze 4, he probably has terrible mechanics. He should focus on playing easy to play champs that can carry a game pretty easily and his mechanics will slowly get better and his game knowledge will increase a bunch since he isn't focusing on playing his champ and he is focusing on playing the game. \n\nEdit: All those champs are roll face champs.

Play hyper carry champions: burst mages and assassins or tanks. I don't recommend jungle, support, and bot because they are \"team reliant.\" If you play jungle, you have to hope your lanes don't all feed. ADC's depend on their supports and vice versa. A mistake made by the ADC or support is usually a lost bot lane. \n\n2. Decide who you want to main or be an OTP altogether. Your match history has told me you like to try a lot of different champions. While it's ok in normals, it isn't in ranked.\n\n3. Work on your cs. 100 cs in 20 minutes will not get you out of bronze. 150 in 20 minutes is usually my goal but it's definitely something I have to work hard on. \n\nBefore you wonder why I'm still bronze 3, it's because I've decided to stop doing ranked this season. Normals games are more fun and allow's for more practice. Ranked is spamming the same champion over and over again. \n\nI can also play a game with you(tomorrow) if you want just to see what you're doing wrong :P.

But if the team sucks you can just go out on turrets and run away. Same thing for Yi. I never played Jax but his kit is designed to destroy turrets. \n\nIt is possible. When I was Bronze4, on Nasus I would just walk up to Inhib and Q it down. I hate to say bronze is bad but a Cassiopea jept trying to duel me and just died.
