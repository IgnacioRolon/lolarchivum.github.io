It's a targeted AoE with a knockup. But if he were to just gesture in a random direction and all of a sudden you were being knocked up, there would be no counterplay. You wouldn't know where exactly it was going to happen or how long you had until it did. Riot adds in a particle effect so that enemies have the opportunity to visibly be aware that the knockup is coming and take steps to prevent it, whether it be a timely flash, a blink, dash ability, or just right clicking in another direction.\n\nYasuo's wall already blocks well over half of what is available in the game. It's safe to say it gives him more than enough as is considering he can cast it for free. Sounds like someone just got wrecked by a VelKoz and isn't too happy about it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Anonagon","date":"2014-12-05T04:39:11.187+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":">wanting windwall to block even more spells\n\nnice meme","replies":[]},{"poster":"Blazing Tenshi","date":"2014-12-05T05:13:45.434+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol, rito fix something that is actually a problem? \nBut yes plz fix it, make the animation go through as well.","replies":[{"poster":"F0ND","date":"2014-12-05T05:18:57.570+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> Lol, rito fix something that is actually a problem? \n> But yes plz fix it, make the animation go through as well.\n\nBut its a projectile and should be blocked.
