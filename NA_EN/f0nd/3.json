We need  to get at least one of her jokes changed to something along the lines of \"Trying to kill me? Your efforts are in Vayne!\" It could at least be added as another joke line if anything. The pun is real and it would fit Vayne's slipperiness. Rito pls.\r\n\r\n(Bump this thread for awareness if I'm not around. Together we can get this changed for the good of all Vayne players!)","replies":[]}
