As someone else has commented, you are only able to earn a chest on a champion once per season.

Do you know/can you say whether there is any plans to add this to the client in the future? Would be very nice to see what grade I got in previous games. What about seeing other players grades? Thanks.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-05-22T23:11:48.569+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"To receive a chest, you must meet a few other requirements;\n\n1. You must have at least 1 of your 4 chest slots available. You can see how many are available in your Champion page.\n2. You must have not received a chest on the champion you're playing yet this season. In your Champion page, champs you've already earned one on will have a gold border.\n3. You must not be ineligible for loot due to current or recent behavioral restrictions.
