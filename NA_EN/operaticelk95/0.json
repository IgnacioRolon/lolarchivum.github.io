I have been surfing the web, and even while the problem persists I have tried downloading to see if it gets interrupted due to problems with the internet. Clearly though, this is not an internet problem. My client is working perfectly fine, meaning that I am connected to the Riot servers with no problems. I am currently in a ranked game which I will probably be reported for being AFK since I can't connect, the reason for that being out of my hands completely, as it's from the server-side. I have seen the problem arise previously with no solutions provided. Here is what happens exactly: 1- I start a game, in this case ranked. 2- Champion select proceeds without any problems whatsoever. 3- Game starts, and my client fails to connect, says error with connection etc etc. No problem, has happened to me before, I could probably restart client before minions spawn, as I have done previously 4- Restart client, attempt to reconnect, and while the game loads: \"You have disconnected. Please check your internet connection and try again.\". Oookay this is weird, let's try again \"You have disconnected. Please check your internet connection and try again.\" Hmm. Maybe there's something wrong with my PC? I'll try restarting it. I might join game late but it's better than nothing, right? \"You have disconnected. Please check your internet connection and try again.\" I'll just keep trying until something happens. \"You have disconnected. Please check your internet connection and try again.\" \"You have disconnected. Please check your internet connection and try again.\" \"You have disconnected. Please check your internet connection and try again.\" Well. There goes my ranked game. I look through Google to see if anyone is experiencing anything similar to what I am, and without a doubt there have been people with the same problem. What do I do?\r\n\r\nThis article was taken from someone (the link I added), but I couldnt comment. So hear it is again.
