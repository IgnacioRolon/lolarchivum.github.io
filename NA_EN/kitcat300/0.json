The pastoral scenery belies a field spattered with blood and littered with the dead and dying. Survivors hack away at each other with rough-hewn axes and scream battle cries. One side is losing quite badly. Stag skulls rest atop pikes stuck into the soil, next to writhing warriors. The few still on their feet are encircled by soldiers riding great shaggy beasts._\n\n> _Those defeated, surrounded few see me and valiance seems to surge through their veins. The wounded rise and grasp their axes and bows in a final stand that throws their foes off guard. I don't linger to see the rest of the little clash play out because I've seen this scenario unfold a thousand times: The survivors will scratch my comet likeness onto their cave walls. In a thousand years, their descendants will fly my image on banners and undoubtedly ride into a tediously similar battle. For all their efforts to capture and record history, one ponders why they do not learn from their mistakes. That is a lesson even I have had to suffer._\n\nIn no way does that piece of lore indicate that either side of that conflict are the Magelords or the Protectorate, or that the stag side were directly connected to Demacia. Nations crumble and are built up again with only culture keeping things consistent, so while Demacia's insignia could've been spawned from the visage of Aurelion Sol in flight, it's not guaranteed that they are descended from the blue side faction of Summoner's Rift, as any culture could've also seen Aurelion Sol flying overhead at some point and done the same thing -\n\n _I've seen this scenario unfold a thousand times: The survivors will scratch my comet likeness onto their cave walls. In a thousand years, their descendants will fly my image on banners_\n\nAs Aurelion's saying, it's happened thousands of times over the course of the universe's history. It's probably happened on Runeterra before.\n\nAnd back to the Magelords and Protectorate thing, again, no mention anywhere of anything indicating that it is the case. Aatrox's lore implies that those two factions were the oldest human civilisations known to history, where as we know that the forces fighting on Summoner's Rift when Aurelion was flying over were doing so at a relatively similar time to when the Sun Disc was being built in Shurima. Aatrox also appeared in Shurima enough to be depicted on pottery, so it's always been implied that the Magelords and Protectorate predate every other known human societies, and given the fact that the blue and red sides of the rift existed when the Shuriman empire was a thing, they aren't old enough to be the Magelords or Protectorate.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Blue Moon Wolf","date":"2016-07-29T18:17:31.102+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Strange how he has more interactions for champs he kills than when he taunts, but I guess that fits his personality. \nThough that part of his taunt to {{champion:122}} about him looking a bit Ionian was interesting.

Tahm's got it out for almost every yordle out there, and Kled clearly knows something about demons.\n\nI feel like we need more explanation on yordles and demons in general, but one proposition I'll make is that Kled's resentment of Noxians might stem from Aatrox twisting the vision of Noxus that Kled originally liked. That's a huge leap in theorising there though so I dunno. Kled's incredibly demeaning to Aatrox _specifically_ so I doubt Kled was empowered by Aatrox, though a meeting between them isn't out of the question.\n\nI do kinda like that these fuzzy yordles are seemingly the natural enemies of demons and darkin.
