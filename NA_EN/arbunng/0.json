It seems like bad design if a player could accidentally run out of space to buy T3 runes because they got a full set of T1 and T2 runes early on.

All things considered, it's pretty rare for people to be hitting the rune cap and even rarer for people to be hitting it before they gain access to T3 runes.  BUT, if anyone happens to run into that issue, then we can take care of that via Player Support tickets :D","replies":[{"poster":"Mysticman89","date":"2016-05-20T00:26:19.920+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Now that T1 runes aren't a thing, are there even 700 runes available for a new player to buy?","replies":[{"poster":"RiotBok","date":"2016-05-20T02:22:00.508+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yep!  I believe there's just shy of 700 Tier 3 Runes and around 140 Tier 2 runes, so it's still possible to reach the cap.
