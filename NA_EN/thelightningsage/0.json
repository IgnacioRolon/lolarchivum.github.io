It can happen from as early as 5 minutes into the game or as late as 30 minutes into the game. When I say the game freezes, I mean the screen is completely frozen.  I can't move my mouse, I can't control-alt-delete, and I can't switch tabs. In other words, my computer gets completely locked down. There's a distinct buzzing noise that occurs when the game freezes as well. \r\n\r\nI've updates my video and audio drivers, and I've completely reinstalled the game. I've tried searching online for solutions as well and haven't come up with anything.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-03T04:46:27.964+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you may be plagued with the Windows Game bar issue caused by the Anniversary update.
