But the sneaky way that Riot goes about this, hoping people won&#039;t notice if they buff &quot;Riot&#039;s Golden Boy&quot;. I am really tired of Riot&#039;s favouritism towards some champions in this game and their unfair treatment of other less popular champions.","replies":[{"poster":"Blåbæret","date":"2016-08-28T10:27:05.582+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"THe problem with Lee Sin is that he can freely invade your jungle and take your buffs early game since you can't duel him - he'll just oneshot you. Buffing Lee without nerfing his early game is pretty stupid imo.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Succubús GF","date":"2016-08-28T09:29:45.454+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Favorites : {{champion:64}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:103}} <-- good luck seeing any of these champs gutted","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2016-08-28T09:35:24.549+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They've only giving ahri nerfs the last few times she's even shown up. the nerf to her charm was a pretty strong nerf on it's own. Ahri just has a good Kit overall, doesn't matter what nerfs she gets tbh.  Last nerf was to her E, enemy champs can still complete their dash or blink so they can end up in safety no matter what. before that was her passive and Q nerf. before that i believe was an ult nerf\n\nyasuo is yasuo.\n\nCant say anything for lee.","replies":[{"poster":"Succubús GF","date":"2016-08-28T09:42:45.365+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean ahri has ALWAYS been strong in all elos so it didnt matter. Yasuo will soon be out of existence when we get 10 bans so yay xD.

Because there is NOTHING that gates their low cooldown, spammable abilities so he does not have to worry about lack of resources in a fight. Give them both mana and ta-dah... he's fixed and cannot dash around like a hyperactive hamster.","replies":[{"poster":"Succubús GF","date":"2016-08-28T09:40:21.702+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"zecastar","date":"2016-08-28T09:51:32.881+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"He 100% needs it and I doubt it's enough.","replies":[]}]}
