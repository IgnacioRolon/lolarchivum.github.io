However this simply is not the case anymore. Sure its harder, but with all the new damage items and damage creep in the game, an assassin can easily 1v1 and kill a tank. This is really disturbing to watch and really highlights the problems with the game at the moment.\r\n\r\nTanks are supposed to be countered by sustained damage like ADC&#039;s (less said about {{champion:67}}, swatter of squishies and tanks alike, the better) but it seems now that assassins are not even afraid of tanks anymore. {{champion:238}}, {{champion:105}} and {{champion:245}} can capitalise on a tank&#039;s lack of damage and just burst them down like they were a normal squishy. \r\n\r\nI want to go back to a season where League was actually about THINKING how to engage your opponent correctly, thinking about their strengths and weaknesses and not the reaction &quot;fighting-game&quot; style &quot;beat-em-up&quot;, its become recently.

I'm just answering your question of why he makes a poor tank.\n\nI wouldn't call the shield spammable though. And since a lot of its power budget is tied to the AoE damage from detonating it, it's not even that amazing of a shield.","replies":[{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2016-07-27T16:47:36.737+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is in very clutched circumstances. \n\nDo people really only want to use his shield offensively?
