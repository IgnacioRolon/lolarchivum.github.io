He is completely unfun to play against because regardless of if you dodge his hook. He is still going to get somebody eventually and thats all he needs to do for free kills. Its offensive, how simple he is to play and how rewarding he is for essentially landing ONE skillshot. \n\nI think thats why I find him so frustrating and usually ban him every time I get the chance. Its actually pretty insulting to me, (I play combo based supports that require landing more then one ability) that Blitzcrank gets all his power from ONE ability! Plus, he has an annoying laugh that will usually be spammed and it doesn&#039;t matter how well ANYONE plays, he will get somebody eventually.\n\nHe is horribly toxic and has been for a long long time. But Riot decided that &quot;point and click&quot; bombs on {{champion:26}} were more toxic then this champion. Whose whole DESIGN is BASED on the idea of playing like a troll. He is an obnoxious, HORRIBLY DESIGNED champion who relies on ONE skillshot to win the game and this just seems completely unfair.\n\nHe actually makes me want to quit the game because of how unfun he is to play against. Yes, you can dodge his Q but he WILL get somebody eventually, just because of the low cooldown on his grab and minimal mana cost and it is not fair watching my ADC get pulled out of my support range because they picked something immobile. Very FEW ADC&#039;s can dodge him.\n\nAt least {{champion:412}} has a level of counterplay with his hook, as does {{champion:111}} who puts himself at risk.

You are already pulling the enemy away from their allies and in range of your ADC. That seems like a pretty massive benefit for one skillshot. Maybe change his knock up to a \"bear hug\" where he holds the enemy there but has counterplay because there is a mechanic that allows you to break free or something? \n\nTaking the silence off his ultimate would help. {{champion:91}} lost his, so why does Blitz still have it after Riot said that \"Silence is toxic and lacks counterplay\"?","replies":[{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2016-09-14T13:28:35.086+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Because assassins had the unhealthy combo of silencing you and then bursting you, preventing you from doing anything in response. \n\nBlitzcrank's silence comes with his burst, so if it doesn't kill you, it'll silence you for a really short duration. It's the only thing that allows him to be useful if he fails to catch you. \n\nCould he use a rework?  Sure, but he's not exactly only played by trolls. \n\nI'd imagine they'd only give him a new W and change his mana shield passive though.","replies":[{"poster":"DiamondLeonis","date":"2016-09-14T13:30:34.408+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Blitzcranks ult actually does a fair bit of damage and has a rather good AP ratio on it.

He's pretty useless if he misses his Q. \n\nYou'd have to make other conditions that Blitzcrank can utilize to be successful. So he'd need changes to allow this. Again I think his W and mana passive should be replaced with something that helps him stay relevant with a missed hook.

The negative side is blits doesn't have the defence naut has. He has his knock up yes, but with naut you say he puts himself in harms way...well yes but his W scales with health and if played right that shield is more ,\"toxic\" than blitz hook imo.\n\nIf your ADC is dumb enough to not position themselves behind their minions (most vayne players) then they deserve the hook. The best counter to blitz is your minion wall.\n\nI'll tell you now I've had some really great blitz games and some horrible, the horrible ones are where the enemy stays behind their minions the while time. Also remember that hook has a rather large hit box so if your playing correctly it will hit a minion if you bait it, early game it has a high cool down.\n\nHope some of this helps, but IMO naut is worse to deal with than blitz.","replies":[{"poster":"DiamondLeonis","date":"2016-09-14T13:27:48.517+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"However {{champion:111}} pulls himself to the enemy, thus putting himself in danger.

LITERALLY EVERYONE OWNS A FREE BLITZ COUNTER.   But it can go beyond that. Braum is good against blitz, morgana as well. They pick blitz?  amumu junlge, reksai jungle, gragas jungle.  You can also pick any number of mobile adcs.  Ezreals the first that comes to mind because you can blink with e just as you get hit by hook and it will still blink away every time. Lucian can dodge, trist and corkis jumps work like ez so they go free as well.\n\nBut on the flipside, blitz technically can counter or hard shut down any squishy member immobile of the enemy team.  He himself counters adcs like varus, ashe, jhin, draven or supports like soraka, sona, lulu.  \n\nTL;DR Blitz is just a specilized counter.  Very good in some matchups and in the right hands will always be a threat to at least the midlaner (although zhyonas).  Very bad when countered or in the wrong hands.","replies":[]}]}
