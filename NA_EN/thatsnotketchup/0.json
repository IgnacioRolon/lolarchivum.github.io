Once I buy an item i can't sell it later on in the game. It's extremely annoying. I can't find a solution. The option is grayed out so when I click sell nothing happens after selecting the item I want to sell. Is there a solution for this???","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-11T02:06:40.061+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm kiiiiind of wondering if you were at the fountain when you were trying to sell those items? You do need to be at the base in the fountain to sell items I believe (off the top of my head) so be sure of that first. If that's still not working, please be sure to bug report this for us!","replies":[]},{"poster":"ThatsNotKetchup","date":"2018-01-12T17:00:31.883+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So i am definately in the base at the starting location. the sell option is always gray for me.
