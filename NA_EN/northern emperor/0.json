I checked my router and my computer and there was nothing wrong. I checked my network with some other devices they showed up fine. I am kinda salty that I get a loss so I just wanted to see if there was potentially an issue with a server or something that caused me to disconnect. We did lose the game I went 5/9/8.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-07-06T16:35:11.989+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I located the game but was unable to find anything out of the ordinary, though the match did result as a loss for your team.  :(  If this is still happening, I highly recommend running through the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide in case your network is having issues reaching the game server.  Though your net might seem okay, you can still have problems reaching specific servers.  Let me know if that clears things up!","replies":[{"poster":"Northern Emperor","date":"2017-07-07T00:40:06.060+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have no clue what happened, but I seem fine now. I have been playing some ARAM and Ranked. The issue has not recurred. I did go through the connection issue guide after making the post and came back with nothing. It might have been like solar winds or something :P Thanks for nothing{{champion:89}} \n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TheViper7911","date":"2017-07-06T07:27:52.519+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But did you check your internet connection?","replies":[]}]}
