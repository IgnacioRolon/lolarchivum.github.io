Now I can typically tell how my laning phase bot is gonna go based off of multiple things such as their ADC&#039;s CS, their positioning, the frequency they throw out their skills (and miss), being easily read etc. and my lane was free. Now I can write out the play by play but for the sake of whoever is reading this, I&#039;m gonna just summarize. My Support gives first blood due to absolutely horrid positioning and inability to dodge skillshots. He tries to roam mid with no vision and dies. He doesn&#039;t pull back when I back despite my warning pings and then dies again to the Jungler, and even though I&#039;m 1v2&#039;ing the lane I&#039;m still ahead in CS by 30+ and managed to salvage kills on an overextended Ez. Infernal is up, so Malzahar pings to take it, our jungler is there as well so they start even though they had no vision, I ping NO, Mid pings NO... they get killed and give up a Drake. Now I decide to finally say something....\r\n\r\nNow I&#039;m not toxic at all... I simply say &quot;Malz... Please...&quot; I tell him not to tilt, and to play smarter. Now this for some reason made him sad, angry whatever i don&#039;t know.. and he starts acting out like a child. Saying &quot;O? so its all MY fault right? Blame the support&quot; and to put it bluntly I said Yes it kinda is, when the enemies team score is made up mostly of you minus 2-3 kills... then yea.. it sorta is. You are level 8 right now.. how many times have you used your ult?.... Zero&quot;.\r\nSo i guess the truth hurt his feelings so he said &quot;fine c-ya&quot; and never came back bot... he didn&#039;t afk, he just went to other lanes and applied some pressure there... which is fine. I ended up losing lane but it didn&#039;t matter because once the laning phase ended and despite being 4v5 I shotcalled properly, carried us and we won the game. In the post game lobby he said he reported me for being toxic...... (aside from what I have already wrote, I didn&#039;t talk to him at all, I muted him)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis game is why I feel... some toxicity is truly deserved. Players that are bad at this game, they NEED to be held accountable for their lack of skills and their mistakes. Otherwise how else will they improve? I really think majority of the people on these forums posting threads complaining about how toxic a player was, how mean this community is etc... are made up of majority of people like my Malzahar support. Players that are oversensitive, easily offended, and simply unable to process constructive criticism. Word of advice... (which you&#039;ll most likely take as an attack....) Grow Up.","replies":[{"poster":"Ulanopo","date":"2017-01-20T05:04:17.441+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I looked up your match on OP.GG.\n\nThe Malzahar is Bronze 3.\nYou're not ranked.\nIt was a blind normal.\n\nNow, my _standard_ advice is to not try and coach or critique your teammates because it rarely helps, but among low-MMR players in a blind normal? That's just asking for trouble. You're lucky all he did was abandon you and your lane. Your team ended up winning and he ended up with a KDA that's pretty much in line with what I would expect from a Bronze 3 player.\n\nAlso, a Bronze 3 support playing poke _who bought a sightstone and used it?_ That's like getting free unicorn rides to work every day. \n\nI do note that you had the highest CS, second highest gold and an excellent KDA. Although, looking at your other ADC matches, I kind of wonder if you didn't split-farm for longer than usual because you were mad at the Malzahar, because your CS in this match is much higher than your average. Unfortunately, you went 19/21 in your last 40 games. 48% isn't going to lift your MMR away from players like the Malzahar.\n\n>This game is why I feel... some toxicity is truly deserved. \n\nYou may feel it's deserved, but it's never acceptable. Not only will it get you in trouble and put your account at risk, giving vent to that frustration actually causes you to lose more games.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-01-20T04:00:53.136+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Asking someone to carry their weight in a polite fashion is not toxic, he was just salty trash.

I'm not a toxic player... but the purpose of my post is to showcase how players are overly sensitive... and honestly if there really is legitimate toxicity occurring... you really have to think WHY is this person saying this to me.... he didn't say it in the pregame lobby... he didn't say it in the early game... he only started saying it.. after I fucked up over and over... :thinking:  \n\nbut they don't process things like that unfortunately... they get defensive, and think... \"this person is so mean, he is attacking me for no reason at all\" i'm gonna show him.","replies":[]},{"poster":"mvmlego","date":"2017-01-20T19:49:24.648+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree that extremely poor play should be called out appropriately. Contrary to what Malzahar says, I wouldn't call what you did \"toxicity\" at all. There's a huge difference between typing \"try to stay behind the minions\" and, \"omg this fat@$$ support eating every skillshot\". It seems to me that you were doing the former, which is fine. I'd be surprised if that report, or ones by others cast in similar situations, actually did anything, and if they did, I'd support you to get your penalty lifted. It's the players who get one death every two minutes, not the ones who constructively call them out on it, who ruin the play experience. Based on what you've written, I think you'd be interested in a thread that I wrote about how Riot should handle excessively careless feeders. I'd be interested in hearing your opinion over on the thread's page. http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/6qUT19A0-intentional-vs-careless-feeding","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lexyy","date":"2017-01-20T16:49:44.090+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is a difference between being bad at the game, and making stupid decisions.

However, were your words constructive?\n\nYou're no fool. Surely you can tell that telling a madman to calm down will only make things worse. Words along the list of \"stop feeding, don't die, play smarter, wake up, grow up, map awareness, where's the countergank, etc\" do nothing apart from showing your frustration and will ultimately not improve the performance of whoever you're speaking to.\n\nDon't get me wrong, you're suffering from something you're not accountable for, and you have my sympathy, but you're not helping at all. He's held accountable for the mistakes, yes, but you have to lift the blame off him so he can play like he optimally would and suggest advice that will turn things for the better - if that's what it takes to win the game, and If you're winning the game without doing so, then I'm afraid you're too good for your opponents and probably shouldn't be in that game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Moetaro","date":"2017-01-20T16:26:53.480+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have had good games and bad ones. I can tell you that good adcs rarely complain even in my worst games. And I can tell you that awful adcs usually complain even in my good games.\n\nThis flaming shit, usually is nothing more than projecting the own lack of skills.\n\nYou can see that even in pro-players. The shittiest is his gameplay in a match, the more imaqtpie complains about his support. If he complains a lot, usually he's playing like crap.\n\nSo be careful if you think that flaming is deserved, because you are probably projecting.","replies":[]},{"poster":"deathgod5","date":"2017-01-20T15:42:35.737+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually agree with you not being in the wrong here, but I don't even consider you toxic here.
