The first few weeks things went OK and had a pretty balanced win rate\r\n(About 60%) and 3 champs/roles I&#039;m starting to get comfortable with. Now at level 22 I&#039;m stuck in games were one of the following things happens:\r\n\r\n- Games were I&#039;m playing against gold/plat players\r\n- Games in which I&#039;m playing against a low level player with high level skill (a lvl 10 who gets about 95% of the cs and crushes me)\r\n- Games in which I&#039;m constantly flamed for being a noob when making a single mistake \r\n- Ok games in which someone on my team seems to be  option 1 or 2 and he makes up for me sucking\r\n\r\nNow i understand that I need to practice, learn the game etc. but it seems to me that I&#039;m the only one in my games that is not busy with \r\ntheir 4th/5th account. Getting constantly flamed or absolutely crushed (and then flamed offcourse) is draining all my fun.\r\n\r\nWere is a genuine new player supposed to go when you can&#039;t play simple unranked? Start over?\r\nI would like to have some tricks and tips on this, since I would like to continue playing and have fun.","replies":[{"poster":"Kat  Head","date":"2015-08-23T15:12:48.453+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Summoners Rift from 5 - 19\n\nAram from 20 - 30\n\nThis allows you to learn how to lane and then learn how to team fight while avoiding the horrible 20 - 30 experience. \n\n20 -30 S R is horribly balanced and a rage factory.\n\n20 - 30 Aram is pretty chill and you get in and out of games really fast.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AirSonance","date":"2015-08-25T03:34:08.798+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My only real tips are these: Tunnel everyone out (not entirely. Need to watch for important info from teammates) so you can focus on improving your game, and try to find someone you can go to for tips, advice, and practice. Even if you don't follow the first tip, I highly recommend the second. It's always good to get a second opinion from a person that isn't you when it comes to improvement.\n\nPlaying bot games is always a good idea for practicing basics line cs'ing and champion mechanics. That, and most people you'll find there are more than willing to give advice.\n\nGood Luck!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Only Play Darius","date":"2015-08-24T21:45:46.697+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ZappoZero,realm=EUW,application-id=WEuoGbmp,discussion-id=mxg3Tkol,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-08-23T12:21:59.259+0000)\n>\n\n> - Games were I&#039;m playing against gold/plat players\n\nYou can thank Riot matchmaking for this. Wouldn't be so bad if all rune slots were unlocked from the start, but naah let's put a lvl 20 against a player with a full page of T3 runes.\n\n> - Games in which I&#039;m playing against a low level player with high level skill (a lvl 10 who gets about 95% of the cs and crushes me)\n\nThis is what we call a smurf. In high elo people can't really try new champions or else they get crushed and their winrate drops, so they try out new champions on a low level account where the slight mistakes they make due to not fully understanding a champion don't get punished.\n\nSome of them also smurf just to be dicks.","replies":[]},{"poster":"bathshebak","date":"2015-08-24T21:40:59.059+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can mute players by pressing tab and you will see some things like sound icons.

I played bots for 2+ years so I was mechanically advanced by the time I played PvP and was at least familiar with what every champion did and where every champion was intended to be played. So I had a very easy transition going into PvP. I was able to hold my own 9/10. So my experiences really won't help you very much.\n\nBut the real reason why I am commenting is because maybe about a month ago I saw someone in your shoes who made a thread about a great idea on how they could get better. They started to make a League journal where they documented their games. They would write 3-4 sections. How did the laning phase go for them, the end result of the game, how many afk/feeders/trolls they had and what they can do to improve. Real simple but the last part might help you for future games. Play a game, document results, ponder future strategies and maybe even research a little bit. And the improvements could be real simple too. I know one of his things was something like \"Played support. 4 enemies taking dragon. I am support Braum. Flashed over wall and attempted dragon steal, failed and died. Lesson? Don't attempt dragon steal unless you know enemy smite is on cooldown.\" Maybe you should look into keeping a league journal too?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Amelie","date":"2015-08-23T23:06:11.416+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can't do anything about the teams you get or play against, but you can at least mute the flamers. You can even mute your whole team when you start the game. It sucks, but you kinda have to grind to level 30, then it will even out after a while. \n\nYour win rate is definitely not gonna stay at 60% though, so maybe prepare yourself mentally for that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CasterGilgamesh","date":"2015-08-23T21:17:39.975+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"mute everyone who even seems remotely toxic and just enjoy the game","replies":[]},{"poster":"BernOut","date":"2015-08-23T20:30:28.005+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When I first made my account, I leveled up from 1-15 on bots (As the xp was decent, it allowed me to learn the game and the people were friendly). After level 15, bots weren't cutting it and I soon realized that playing normals was simply asking for trouble (Especially since people with a higher level had greater access to runes and masteries). \n\nFor me, the answer was in ARAM. Decent xp, quicker games, generally casual players (There are exceptions), and it allows you to practice team fighting. Once I was able to hit 30, I found going back to normals at lot better as I had T3 runes, 30 masteries and the matchmaking seemed a lot more accurate.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BluePolarizer","date":"2015-08-23T18:14:10.671+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just remember this:\n\nmost of the people who rage in pre-30 games are bronze or silvers.\n\nif you get to plat without being boosted, you'd probably understand that there's a huge range of skill differences, and not rage at ppl.

If one of your teamate have 2 tier 2 quints and end up in front of a player with 3 tier 3 quints. While it's not that obvious, added to the players experience in the game, it make that lane nearly garanteed to lose. All the players in that game will start with a massive advantage or disadvantage due to the rng nature of the matchmaker.\n\nThe mass of lol players are level 30 so it's even harder to match the small player pool correctly. And yes there is a lot of plain bad players, troll and smurfs in those games.\n\nAll I can tell you is to stick with us. Try your best to have fun even when you lose horribly and in no time you'll end on the 27-29 club who stump in most of their games because of masteries.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ZergReap","date":"2015-08-23T15:07:40.208+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the best way to get even games is honestly rank when you hit 30, and see where you land. Pre-level 30 is so bad for new players who don't have experienced friends already, not much you can do. Majority of players in those games have made a lvl 30 account or high rank already. They beat down the new players in game, but it's just how its just how it goes when someone just started. Then they get mad at them for \"feeding and ruining the game\", but in reality they are ruining the new players experience. Try to add others who did good in game and were friendly. It won't make games easier, but more enjoyable if you join games with them. Plus you will learn quicker and the more you know the more fun the game is.\n\nRanked is the most even games I think because in normal's you can have random groups of 2+ players spread around all ranks. Do your 10 matches which might feel the same as the usual smurf games at first. Once you are done though I think you would like it. \n\nHonestly, my friends and I played mainly bots to lvl 30 and went straight into ranked. I wouldn't recommend it to all, but you can escape the pain of normal games and still get to 30 quick. Since I never fought real players I was put in bronze 5 and had to play quite a bit to catch on. Since bronze is the lowest tier it's where many start and there is nothing wrong with that. People are still going to yell at each other and rage, but that is just their problem so. Hope this helps.","replies":[]},{"poster":"feral rrooaarrrr","date":"2015-08-23T13:50:54.044+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you are facing these types of people it means you are good enough to belong there. As for the flaming that simply comes from people knowing the game well enough to get mad at eachother, and that low gold level is the worst for it. If its really a problem just say at the start of the game you will mute if there is any flaming, or if it really bothers you, just mute immeadiately. if you are uncomfortable trying new champs, i believe team builder has a seperate mmr, so you should be against worse opponents on champs you are not strong on. Positive attitudes win games, if you can keep your team working together and trying it is  a valuable skill to learn. Playing with friends is always an option too.","replies":[]}]}
