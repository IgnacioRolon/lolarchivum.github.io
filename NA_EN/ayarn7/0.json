I made an account a while ago, it was a high level, then someone tries to log in to it.after that it gets banned for suspicious login and the only way for me to get the account back would be to submit a ticket and try to recover it, I give them all the information I could think of, and nothing. They tell me they can't recover my account with that information, and or it wasn't correct. After trying for countless days I gave up and stopped playing. Fast forward to just recently, I had an old account that I made a year or 2 ago that was only level 2. It had some end of the season rewards, and possibly RP from when they used to give you 400 free RP. So, I tried logging into that account and realized I didn't remember the password or username, just the account name. I spent hours checking emails, but I've made so many, including throwaway ones and I can't seem to find which one I made the account with, I've tried all of the ones I could remember.\r\n\r\nSo, despite me knowing how shit trying to recover an account was, I figured I could almost definitely recover this account as it was level 2 and I knew most of the info (well at least I thought I did, not according to Riot support though)......and I get the same bs response as I did for my first recovery for my other account I had tried. Listen, I know you guys want to make sure it's actually the original owners getting their accounts back, but this is ridiculous. For anyone who's played this game for longer than a year most of the info you make them provide is completely lost to them. Unless they wrote down every single thing they bought and purchased, and when they made the account to the exact day, it's impossible to recover an account. Most people don't even know what their first champions bought were, some do. All of my friends have been playing for years and that escapes them. And the date they made their account? How the hell is anyone supposed to know that. When people start playing this game they don't pay attention to things like that, they just play. For my recent account, I tried recovering, I knew exactly where it was created. The date is nearly impossible, all I could say was 2016-2017. It was level 2 so there's almost no chance it had any champions bought on it aside from the free ones from facebook, twitter, and youtube. \r\n\r\nIt looks like I lost another account for no other reason than being gimped by the system. I'll admit I'm salty about this, as I've done this multiple times to no avail, with multiple different \"Rioters\" with submitting support tickets. I literally would only need the email the account was made with and I'd be able to log in and reset my password, everything would be good. But they won't even do that. So yeah, the account this time is only level 2, but it's not the level it's the concept of it being so nearly impossible to recover accounts. I'm most likely not going to bother making another one if something like this happens in the future. Hopefully, this flawed recover system is revised in the future. There are multiple posts and players who have complained about the same thing, clearly, SOME people are able to recover their account if they either have a good memory or literally keep track of everything they've done in this game, but many people don't. Clearly, not a lot of people will have to recover their accounts so they won't face this issue, but if a mass spread account shut out were to happen, I could only assume the amount of outrage about not being able to recover accounts that would ensure.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-11-18T19:13:34.339+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The point isn't to get everything right, but to do your best in answering them.  I know the process can feel a bit of a hassle, but we have to be strict on this to make sure the account is returning to the owner without a shadow of a doubt.  If you continue to fail recovery, it's totally okay to try again by submitting another [account recovery form](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=72416).  If you have a ticket number, I can look into this as well, but the decision is ultimately up to the account recovery team.","replies":[]}]}
