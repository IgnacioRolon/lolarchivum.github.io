I used to have fun pushing games as long as possible and making a comeback by working as hard as I possibly can. Sometimes in games of 80 minutes plus, and yes, in previous seasons I&#039;ve had a lot of them. Knowing you could come back and having that never surrender attitude used to pay off, used to. Now, one champion gets fed and bleeds all over map, sometimes not even assisting other players to help them, just sh***ng on you and bouncing out.\n\nFor one or two players, sure that&#039;s fun. For the other players on that team, the win feels good. Realistically though, is this how you want your game to be? Do you prefer it to be a quick match? Does the fun factor even play into the game anymore? \n\nAnymore, every game I play feels like frustration, and I&#039;m having a hard time not moving on to something else. Maybe I should give up on league, and move to something newer. I feel as though the only thing I can try to improve is my ability to deal with severe frustration, which seemingly won&#039;t help me enjoy the game anymore. After a string of quick losses, I really cannot find the desire to play more, or the hope that the next one will be better.\n\nI know I&#039;m only one voice, and I know that I&#039;m not the best of players, but I hope this message matters to someone somewhere. Eventually, I hope that the snowballing mentality of the game will lessen, and more players can have an impact on the game. Maybe its just a personal gripe, and no one else feels this way. \n\nThanks for reading,\nThe Angry Frustrated Nerd\nDawsonator\n\nEdit for lack of auto filter.","replies":[{"poster":"Darkmind1212","date":"2015-06-10T17:31:26.410+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You know that this line of thinking is only a very small percentage of the overall league community right?","replies":[]}]}
