Both were dc'ing at the same times. One of those times was when we were doing baron lol. Anyway, is there a way to get a loss prevented for this? They probably dc'd a total of like 15-20 times, for just a minute or so.

Let's go ahead and run some tests using this [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues).\n\nPay close attention to port forwarding and how to flush your DNS, but be sure to go through all of the steps just in case.
