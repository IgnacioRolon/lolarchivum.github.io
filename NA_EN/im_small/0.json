It&#039;s uncreative and incredibly boring when a gay character is just there to be the &#039;token&#039; gay. However, I definitely don&#039;t see Neeko like this, but it seems that many people do. \r\n\r\nIn Neeko&#039;s interactions she has like what, 10 lines max that show her crushing on other female champs? I don&#039;t understand how people think that&#039;s &#039;too much&#039; and &#039;reducing her to her sexuality&#039;. It&#039;s not as if she&#039;s running around screaming &#039;I&#039;m a lesbian!&#039;. I think it&#039;s cute how Riot have portrayed her attraction to some of the female champions without making it overwhelming.\r\n\r\nSecondly I&#039;ve seen people take issue with Neeko&#039;s creator saying that she &#039;identifies as a lesbian&#039;. I don&#039;t think the creator meant that Neeko would be the type to actually say &#039;Hey everyone, I&#039;m a lesbian&#039;, but simply that she&#039;s just attracted to girls. \r\n\r\nI hate how as soon as Riot make a character that&#039;s canonically gay people accuse of them of catering to SJWs and getting too political. When Varus&#039; lore was changed one of the major complaints was that Riot should&#039;ve added a new champion if they wanted a gay character.. well that&#039;s what they&#039;ve done and people are still accusing of them of doing it just for diversity. Gay people actually do exist irl, and in a game with 140+ champs what&#039;s wrong with 1 lesbian? People don&#039;t complain about Xayah and Rakan rubbing their relationship in everyone&#039;s faces, but suddenly when a girl champion makes cute remarks and crushes on other girl champions people accuse Riot of pandering..? I just don&#039;t understand.","replies":[]}
