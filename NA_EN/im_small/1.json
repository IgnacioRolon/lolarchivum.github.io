Taliyah - this one is obvious really, aside from an esports skin she's received nothing since her release. Her upbeat personality and her being cute is exactly what the SG line is all about. \r\n2. Annie - she hasn't had a skin for a little while and she fits into the theme pretty easily.\r\n3. Sona - at first I wasn't sure since Odyssey doesn't seem like that long ago, but seeing as Yasuo is getting arcade in the next patch I'd say SG Sona is very likely.\r\n4. Zoe - this skin pretty much makes itself.\r\n5. Kayle - recently reworked so now is much more likely to receive skins, also fits into the theme very well.\r\n\r\nThey're the 5 who I think are most likely going to be this year's Star Guardians, but others I think could be possible are:\r\n-Ashe\r\n-Taric\r\n-Xayah &amp; Rakan\r\n-Neeko\r\n-Urgot (it wouldn't surprise me tbh)\r\n\r\nSo yeah, they're my predictions. Who would you like to see as the new Star Guardians?","replies":[{"poster":"Targon","date":"2019-06-12T16:29:00.970+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":2,"body":"My guesses would be:\n\n{{champion:350}} - Fits the theme too well and she's popular.\n\n{{champion:37}} - She's one of the few female enchanters left that doesn't have an SG skin (apart from Karma, but she just got a skin).\n\n{{champion:39}} - Popular and would fit the line well.\n\n{{champion:163}} - Not entirely convinced since she could also get a really good Halloween skin later this year too.","replies":[{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2019-06-12T21:07:14.207+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Pray tell, how would you think that Taliyah would get a Halloween skin over Yuumi, a cat flying on a spellbook?

I've been trying to predict the future star guardians too. Here are my predictions:\n\n{{champion:44}} - Taric's last skin was the pool party one 3 years ago. The Star Guardian skins have a \"cute\" theme, and among the boys who could fit the theme well is Taric. Im speculating that he could be kind of like the \"boss\" of the star guardians. \n\n{{champion:498}} {{champion:497}} - Even though these two got skins not too long ago we know that team skins don't count, and their last non-esports skins were the sweetheart ones a year and a half ago. They're popular, can fit the \"cute\" theme and their abilities would look good with sparkly effects. Almost a safe bet.\n\n{{champion:142}} -  I don't think this needs much explanation. Her last skin was almost a year ago and she just fits the theme too well.  Im not sure on this one but I wouldn't be surprised by it.\n\n{{champion:518}} - Ok, hear me out on this one. She fits the theme, and even though she was released not too long ago, we know that popular new champs get their second skin fast (hi, Pyke) also, we know for sure that there's a skin for her in development since they explained that Winter Wonder Neeko would go to the legacy vault next christmas but she would get a skin before that. Since the Star Guardian skins usually come with cinematics, lore and all that stuff, they probably pick the champions very early so if they already knew she was getting a skin for sure maybe its cause she's part of the future star guardians.\n\n\n{{champion:10}} {{champion:25}} - I wouldn't call them \"cute\" per se, but just like Syndra, they could be cute if they decided to make them. Morgana's last skin was almost 3 years ago and Kayle's was almost 2 years ago and since they worked on them recently I wouldn't be surprised if they were working on a skin for them and I think it could perfectly be star guardian skins.\n\n{{champion:163}} - Honestly this is more something I hope than a prediction. This lady has a lot of potential for cool skins yet all she got since release was an esports skin that doesn't even count. I get she's not the most popular champ, but still. Let Taliyah be a Star Guardian!\n\n{{champion:92}} - So yeah... I fear she might be chosen for the skin line. Just like they did with arcade, they'll have to pick one of the super popular champs for star guardian to get money, and her last skin was a year ago... still, I hope she gets the PROJECT one and not this one. \n\n{{champion:133}} - People constantly forget she exists but her last skin was 2 years and a half ago, and even though she's not very popular I think she would look good on star guardian, there are a lot of cool concepts.\n\n{{champion:1}} - She clearly fits the theme and everything and her last skin was almost 2 years ago so yeah.

How would you translate earthbending to sparky magic? (I'm actually salty she didn't get to be in the arcade skin line since I think her earthbending could have been amazing as a tetris reference. Such wasted potential. I also think she fits Pool Party more than star Guardian: original Taliya: earth bending. Winter Taliya: ice bending. Pool party Taliya: water bending: surf style) But if you make her earth bending shiny magic wouldn't it look weird and confusing from a clarity viewpoint?\n\n-The same goes with Irelia. How do you translate flying knives to magicall sparks withouh creating a clarity mess? \n\n-So I think we have to take into account popular champions that even if tematically speaking might not fit, they have potential to have effects fotting sparky magic withputh creating a clarity mess.

I think that'd be good, plus she doesn't get that many skins. I'm dying for Taliyah, Zoe, and Neeko though, so I'm gonna have to overrule Ashe and Morgana.

Plus...she's already pretty much star themed. I don't see how they'd make a star themed basic skin into a star guardian without making it essentially a chroma.\n\nTaliyah definitely has a quirky sort of fit to her. At the very least, I can see her kit converting to glitter well enough...even the ground FX can be glowing magical glitter circles that pretty much say \"you can't draw enough magic from this area\" so contrary to what other people are saying, she's not the worst fit. She'd seem kind of like the \"Rock Lee\" of the group - definitely quirky and awkward compared to the others, but absurdly motivated and terrifying at her unique style.\n\nI just don't see them passing up Ashe though. Not to say I necessarily want them to or not, more just saying I doubt it. She's one of those \"photogenic\" sort of champs that just sort of fits in wherever they want her, and she's also pretty much one of the main faces of LoL in general, so the odds of them passing her up are rather slim.\n\nMorgana and Kayle both just got major lore and graphics updates...so one or the other of them are likely to get a new skin soon, and Morgana is generally the more favored of the two (and has easier particle FX for it).\n\nNeeko would be the most interesting on this list. But in a way, I feel like she's in direct competition with the role Taliyah would fit - quirky and awkward, but also powerful.","replies":[{"poster":"Rashlasher","date":"2019-06-13T01:50:40.755+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good point about Zoe; that was my reason for Annie as well. I think they could make her work though, and it'd be fun to do something with her hair. While she's pretty childish, Lulu is also more childishly whimsical. I could see her joining as a sort of first year in between Lulu and Jinx.\n\nMaybe it's just rumors but yeah Taliyah seems like the obvious choice and I support it. I agree with your points about Morg and Kayle, I just don't want them to. I still find Morg a little...not boring exactly, but I'm tired of her even with the update. Kayle's particles are harder like you said. \n\nI really don't want Ashe. I dunno, I feel like she has a shit ton of skins, doesn't need more, and I'm also kind of tired of her. She's photogenic in a boring way, unlike say Ahri or Lux (Lux skins being a bit much though ofc lol). On the other hand, I'd beg for Neeko. I think she could distinguish herself from Taliyah in her own \"curious chameleon\" way--she's a little foreign/has eccentric ideas, while Taliyah is quirky but grounded (ba dum tss). Plus, she'll add the animal-girl to the crew!
