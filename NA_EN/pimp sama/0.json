Everything else works fine- my fps and ms. Everything still seems to run smoothly around me (teammates, enemies, etc.) so it's definitely not internet problems. I tried hextech repair and CCleaner but nothing fixed the problem. Can anyone tell me how to fix this????","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-01T21:17:06.295+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Those champions freezes sound an awful lot like what happens when your connection is having packet loss issues. Luckily we can test for just that by having our [**log reader**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743) scan the recent network logs from a game that had that weird champion freezes. \n\nPost a screenshot of what it gives you here so that I can take a look over it with you.","replies":[]}]}
