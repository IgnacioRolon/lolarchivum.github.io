(Normals)\r\n\r\nIn the past I&#039;ve seen some Rioter&#039;s join their fellow summoners on the rift for their 1000th game. I know some of y&#039;all are probably busy, so I don&#039;t mind If your answer is no. After almost 2-3 years of consecutive playing, I&#039;d love if y&#039;all would accompany me into my 1000th.\r\nAnd if that doesn&#039;t convince you guys here&#039;s some fun facts!\r\n\r\n*Fun Facts*\r\n\r\n- With an average game of league of legends on Summoner&rsquo;s Rift lasting about 30 minutes, I have spent 29970 minutes in-game. 29970 Minutes is equal to 499.5 hours or 20.81 days. I have spent almost 3 weeks in the past 2-3 years ganking lanes, dying to jungle creeps, and smackin&#039; Dragons! \r\n- My favorite position/role is jungle, so you know I&#039;ll be supporting you guys through my *SKILLED* ganks!\r\n- I loved Warwick so much when I first started playing, I built a 10 inch statue to commemorate him!\r\n- I recently dressed up as Jax for Halloween by draping myself in purple blankets and taping a lamp shade to a metal rod.\r\n- You can be a part of my 500th win, which means I will hold an exact 50% win rate in normals. \r\n\r\nIf you&#039;re considering a game with yours truly, I&#039;m under Central Time and I usually am available from 4:00pm - 10:00pm on weekdays, 9:00am - 12:00am on weekends. \r\n\r\nThank you guys for the great memories I&#039;ve made so far.","replies":[]}
