Teach me your ways senpai. I wish to become more than a mere mortal.\n\nHere some extra photos. Shown below is one of the forum moderators leaving up a thread for which I was banned for a solid 20 minutes after issuing said ban. Noticing they screwed up, another mod (or same one) re-issued ban to save face. Actually I would have rather had the 7-day ban I was originally issued if it meant they had actual accountability.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/QdRNrka.png\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/aOpjRap.png\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/zlfi1rw.png\n\nAn example of how it SHOULD be done.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/HJbicei.png\n\nYes Keyru fanboys, your down-votes sustain me. They fuel my drive. Thank you for your continued support in these hard times :^)\n","replies":[]}
