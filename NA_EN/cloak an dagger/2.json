Afraid to explore and of change. Just a dull type of person all around. no friends.\n\nSausage- Outspoken and bold. Not vegetarian so we get along better. Very outgoing and can have a short fuse.\n\nVegan/vegetarian- I respect your effort to take care of your body but at the same time, shame on you for making/trying to make the iconic american fat and greasy food healthy. You are also the same type of person that doesn&#039;t give a shit what people think of you or your life choices so I respect that also. We simply can&#039;t be friends.\n\nSupreme- The amicable and friendly type of person who gets along with most everyone, has a sense of humor, and is cool to be around. Is also at least responsible enough to add veggies.\n\nMeatlover- you naughty grill. ;) (seriously..master race in my un-biased opinion)\n\nPepperoni- The average Joe. The kind no one really notices until they speak. Still, solid choice.\n\nAny other topping or mix of different toppings- interesting and usually eccentric. They pique my curiosity and I am drawn to learn about them. Usually worth having a meaningful and engaging conversation with.\n\nThis is just my personal opinion. I&#039;m sure there are exceptions.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/yN1LyK4.jpg","replies":[]}
