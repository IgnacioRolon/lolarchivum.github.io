We think win rate's a useful metric, but it's an indicator that something needs to be looked at, not something that should decide things by itself.\n\nIn this particular case that sort of spike in win rate certainly means Graves is worth a closer look. From a quick glance at our internal data it looks like some of that stated increase is low sample size or a sampling issue (we're seeing him up a bit, but nowhere near 4%). Looking at his files there don't seem to be any significant changes that weren't in the patch notes either (couple of visual bug fixes for skins, but that's about it). Good champ to keep an eye on for a couple of weeks as a result, see if there's a trend going on or just a temporary spike.","replies":[{"poster":"The Blue Rajah","date":"2016-01-19T07:33:28.004+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":2,"body":"A good, solid, sensible reply.

Power is easy to measure; frustration isn't. Power-wise, Tahm is actually in a good spot (pre-season may have given him a slight bump, but he was very weak before).\n\n>**Power is measured by win rate. Obviously you then have a bunch of conditionals to that winrate (what ELO are we looking at? How does this behave over time? How does the winrate change with game length? What positions are we looking at?), but in the end of the day, power is knowable.\n**\n>Internal tools show Tahm Kench at a 47-48% winrate in the last three weeks across all regions and game lengths, in Normal 5v5s, Ranked Solo 5v5s, and Teambuilder 5v5s at ELOs of 1500+. If we expand to all ELOs, I see him at 49%, but at a slight downward trend (suggesting that at lower ELOs people are doing a worse job playing against Tahm, but are learning). Pre-season bumped him up by about 2%, so he was at 45-46% before in high ELO.\n\n>So again, if you're arguing that his power is too high, I will politely disagree, which is why I phrased this thread not in terms of power, but in terms of frustration. Frustration can come from power, but I don't think that's the case here. Janna has had 53/54% winrates literally for years now, and I never hear people talk about Janna as a highly frustrating character to play against (although Gosu may disagree with me here. Is Janna powerful? Absolutely. That E alone is ridiculous, and she is the queen of disengage. But is she frustrating to play around?

If I win, cool. Everyone is just another player to me in this game; rank factors nothing to how I play. Being Diamond doesn't magically make you more skilled than everyone else (as we all know from boosted accounts). There is, admittedly, a correlation between skill and rank, but honestly not enough to warrant people being dicks to low elo players like we can't understand the game.\n\nLike really, why do people think we're mentally handicapped or something?","replies":[{"poster":"AyRe CoNteMpT","date":"2016-01-20T08:42:34.670+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"oh yeah right with the name im sorry, i get like 20 replies per day and mustve confused this. my bad.\n\nwith the ranks, its really cool that you dont have a mindset of defeat when facing a challenger or high elo player/team in general.\n\nand OFCOURSE a rank doesnt mean shit by itself because you could be boosted, accbuyer or whatever but if that rank is genuinely earned, then that MOST LIKELY places you somewhere around that skill level. even tho this is only your SOLOQ prowess and doesnt neccessarily translate into broadband game knowledge. you can be a shaco main with 1000 games and diamond and still dont know jack shit about the game except how to cheese noobs. tho what is for sure is that you know better how to cheese noobs than a shaco main stuck in gold.\n\njust in general i'd really wish that people would respect ranks more. they DO have a meaning and ofcourse they dont incline you to be a dick but it just is very hard not to be when you meet so much disrespect. literally people asking for advice but what they want to hear as an answer has to fit their EXTREMELY LIMITED LOW ELO view of the game.\n\ni mean check out my first post. \n\"its because graves is a champion who can deal alot of damage in a very simple, braindead manner and without putting himself in danger too much. this means, its hard to \"fuck it up\" with him so noobs dont lower his winrate by their noobness. the point about graves is, you have to respect his damage and since league players tend to respect nothing and nobody and forget everything they learned from the last game instantly, he owns people pretty hard.\n\noh and also, the instant double Q is too strong.\"\n\nsure it might not sound super friendly but its a very valid explanation and it is also the truth but it has 22 downvotes becauses you know, noobs will be noobs.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Droogzy","date":"2016-01-18T18:39:21.149+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would say its most of an increase in popularity since he was seen in LCS, I've played him a few times in jungle since seeing him on LCS scene since I was curious to see how it was.","replies":[{"poster":"TotalJerk","date":"2016-01-19T01:58:35.825+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"The LCS popularity probably showed a lot about how to properly build and play Graves.","replies":[{"poster":"Droogzy","date":"2016-01-19T02:22:51.484+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=TotalJerk,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=6Jzlocg6,comment-id=00060001,timestamp=2016-01-19T01:58:35.825+0000)\n>\n> The LCS popularity probably showed a lot about how to properly build and play Graves.\n\nYeah I think that's what really influenced it, there were a lot of different builds and ways to play Graves, no one was really sure how the best way to play him was, outside of the fact that he IS a viable choice in the jungle. Now that build is clearer, it might be easier to win with him.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MrBuffington","date":"2016-01-18T20:58:32.586+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Usually an increase in popularity drops a champion's winrate, because an influx of players who don't know how to play the champion start coming in, which drags the average down from the mains who are actually good at the champion.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Akali is SO HOT","date":"2016-01-18T18:28:40.487+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":5,"body":"???????????\n\nThey put his Q on his auto attack and he can get 120 armor and magic resist for free.
