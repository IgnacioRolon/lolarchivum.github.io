One random day (yes today), without any warnings in previous days, I got a message that I demoted to Gold 1. Now I'm G1 75 LP. What I don't get is that I have been demoted by possibly \"elo decay\" but I had no warnings. Pretty BS if you ask me because I got messages about possible elo decays most of the time. Would like a response on why I demoted or why I get no messages to play a ranked. Pretty stupid to have to go through a series to get back.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-11T22:41:11.280+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It does sound like your account experienced[ ranked decay](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204010760-Ranked-Play-FAQ) in this case.  A notification should appear but it's not guaranteed, and it's really important to keep track on your own so there's no unexpected decay.  Hopefully a win will get you back in a series.  Good luck!","replies":[]}]}
