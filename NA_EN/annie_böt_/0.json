Not a single scratch on improvement OOF, but but how can this be, the #s just don't add up!? I did everything by the book and game still doesn't believe I behaved, well Johnny boi, it can smell your expectations via satellite and not want to giv ... I'm Just kidddinggggg lol\n\nJust play like your friendly neighborhood bronze players ( No joke they play for fun and it's something everyone above silvers literally lack){{sticker:sg-poppy}}  they be chowing downtown , slurping with their crown ka pow they just hit honor lvl 5 like now!, literally they just play 1 or 2 games and done for the day, not say anything in chat or bad, giving honor to their teammates that also prob gave honor, (unless they are friends then that honor means little to the system) bam everyone voted honor . heres that sweet pocket change honor for everyone re log back in next day for another honor lvl up.\n\nListen the honor moves in waves,you're not going to hit lvl 5 from lvl 0 in 1 day, log back in the next day and see if it's there after playing a game getting that bonus pocket change honor and repeat.  So don't beat yourself up over something complex, this honor isn't even as good as the past 1, it's not rewarding whatsoever since it's like an overwatch knock off to honoring now. it don't matter if you are the support that went 42/0/69 they going to give the honor to the adc that let you kill \"secure\". \n\nAnyway, sorry for the long message and probably awful sentence structures that may trigger those strictly in English everywhere, you should see my handwriting, it gets worse lol.","replies":[]}]}
