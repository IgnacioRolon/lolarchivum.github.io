If you're looking for the forums post, [click here](http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=4328969&highlight=).*\n\nHello! The name’s DI The Second (AKA **D**eath**I**nvoker in LAS, DI The First is myself after the transfer), and I present to you a skin idea I had for my favorite champ and wanted to share. Introducing **Surfer Nami**!\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/iqIq7iI.jpg\n*Left: Original design by DI The Second/DeathInvoker – Right: Current design by [Asfalanub (LAS)](http://asfalanub.deviantart.com)\n(Yeah, I'm not the best at drawing, but you understand the idea, right?)*\n\nAs you can see, she’s still a Marai/mermaid, and her looks are similar to Classic Nami, but of course, she's equipped for the summer with her swimsuit, sunglasses and her surfboard (which has a small icon of her main weapon: the Tidecaller's Staff). She also has a Philo Stone pendant as a bonus.\n*If the surfboard changes her silhouette too much, a surfy staff can work too. Thanks to CaptainMårvelous for the idea.*\n\nFor animations, my current idea is that she could surf when reaching 450+ MS (her Hasted Run). If not, she would swim like surfers reaching the waves. Her dance would be a Hawaiian dance.\n\nFinally, Nami’s abilities will suffer some changes. **Aqua Prison** will still be a bubble, but with some beach ball touches and a volleyball-like shot, **Ebb and Flow** makes her throw a frisbee (with Riot's logo for tons of damage!), **Tidecaller’s Blessing** gives some fruit to an ally champion with juicy explosions on hit (idea by ALEXKOND from LAS), and finally, looks like hitting the land with the surfboard still summons **Tidal Waves**, but they can have watery riders like Urf, Chomper, Surfer Singed or even Nami herself! (idea by Riot SlackZ from LAS)\n\nWant to create some Surfer Nami art? Do it and post it here!\nLike the skin? Comment and upvote!\nSeeing something wrong or you just don't like something?

Then again, I'm a Nami main, so I'm a bit biased. ;D \n\nI was even thinking having the **Aqua Prison** burst with some sandy-looking particles when they burst! We could take your beach all idea, and toss that on **Tidecaller's Blessing**. :D As for Ebb and Flow, I love the idea of a frisbee.  I would love to see Urf riding in her **Tidal Waves**. \n\nI agree that that biggest issue, which has already been mentioned is that her silhouette would drastically change if she had the surfboard positioned like you had it in the concept. I feel like the silhouette would also be an issue for **Tidal Waves**, depending on what / who you actually put in the waves, and to what scale. \n\nMaybe she could be on a smaller surfboard of sorts? I love the idea of making some sort of beachy / surfer staff. If only Leona didn't use an umbrella already!","replies":[{"poster":"Lady Zataku","date":"2014-07-29T00:36:56.094+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"As another Nami main I would find it amazing for this and to add on to your idea for the animations it would be amazing if in her ult there would be the sound of seagulls or something along those lines. Maybe for the ult windup she would spin and throw the surfboard into the wave? possibly urf riding it :D as for how she would move with her heal it would be awkward as she would kinda be flailing a surfboard for that. Her back could just have her be sitting on the board with ocean type wavy ripply water stuff(amazing technical terms in action there) below her.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CaptainMårvelous","date":"2014-07-22T04:12:08.272+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"My problem (And likely Riot's): The surfboard is going to -greatly- change Nami's silhouette. So she might need something smaller or that can be similar to a staff. LOVE the skin (So cute!) but there might be an issue.
