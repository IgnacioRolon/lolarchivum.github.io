All I get in my games are feeders and trolls. Yes, yes I know what you are going to say that I have to carry myself etc etc... But when I tp in to a fight at 3 mins into the game as Irelia, my team picks up 3 kills thanks to the tp and we snowball the game from there. At 10 minutes we are 20 kills ahead but no towers haveb een taken. I keep asking them to help me push but no, scuttle more important. In the end we lost the game with a 15 kill lead and about 100 cs for each player(excluding support) lead all becoase no one would help me push. This is just one of my many games that go pretty much the same way. So I am getting very frustrated and mad at this game. I would like to sell my account before i actually get cancer from playing with idiots again. Any legal way?\r\n\r\nTL;DR I want to sell my account... How can i do so legally?{{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}}","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-03-30T17:25:13.887+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"As mentioned, this is against the Terms of Use.

Think about how much money they could potentially make off of a fresh account vs one already made with skins and who knows what else on it.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"St3rkf0nt31n","date":"2016-03-30T11:00:33.926+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Really?
