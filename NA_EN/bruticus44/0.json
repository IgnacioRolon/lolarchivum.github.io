I wanted to share an idea which I think may be helpful or may not be, you can decide.\n\nAt the moment it is kinda like a free-for-all everyone is scrambling to have their ideas heard by riot and discussed amongst the Riot Community. What if there was a hierarchical  Question and Answer Thread that is Read Only for the majority of players. The only people who would be allowed to post would be Rioters and people who were invited to make a one time post due to their thread or post having x number of up-votes (each player only gets x up-votes allotted to them each week). Riot could invite the top up-voted threads or posts to the Question and Answer thread where the OP could summarize their points and the points of the community to Riot. Riot would then not have to sift through the thousands of discussions and would save them time. Players would have one central location to find their most pressing questions answered.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this in terms of pros and cons?\n\n-Please see below for Krylhos comment and my response which I try to clarify this suggestion a bit more.","replies":[{"poster":"Kajika91","date":"2013-09-18T05:37:06.207+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Could need a controvesial sort as well imo... posts that imply a lot of votes should be taken into account.","replies":[{"poster":"Krylhos","date":"2013-09-18T06:11:03.968+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":6,"body":"Here sir, have an upvote.\n\nEdit: Gave myself a downvote for this post.","replies":[{"poster":"Sp1n Kuro","date":"2013-09-18T07:34:34.670+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"No offense to you, but posts like this are the ones I don't like >.< \n\nThey bring nothing to the discussion.\n\n\nIf this forum is going to be more like reddit I'd rather it at least discourage all the memes and \"circlejerks\" that reddit is infamous for.","replies":[{"poster":"Krylhos","date":"2013-09-18T17:51:51.570+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"You make a solid point, and no offense taken. \n\nI should have provided a better response rather than affirming an agreement. \n\nThe geek in me was curious as to how these kinds of reactions evolve within this community site, and I'm glad to see how it was taken!","replies":[{"poster":"Hellsaw","date":"2013-09-19T01:35:01.155+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How can you prevent all this trollish-ness with this style?\nSomething that made me think.

I agreed with you and downvoted Krylhos, because I didn't feel like he was really contributing to the discussion. I'll have to suffer the consequences this morning when I go into work, but I'll do it FOR YOU GUYS.\n\nBut in all seriousness, determining what a vote means and collaborating with you guys to shape the platform around that meaning, is one of the core things we're going to work on in tandem with everyone involved in the beta.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Soli Deo","date":"2013-09-18T19:20:41.934+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree.

A goal of this system is to help raise quality content, which includes pressing issues. Although, I'm not sure if limiting players from talking or engaging would help, in the end. \n\nWe're aiming to encourage higher quality discussions within this new system, so and those back and forth's carry a lot of value.","replies":[{"poster":"Bruticus44","date":"2013-09-18T06:41:03.761+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good luck keeping up with all the suggestions as they come pouring in! \n\nJust a quick clarification, I wouldn't consider this a limitation on player engagement. Rather, as a stage where players, through their own voting and discussions, \"directly\" interact and play a part in fleshing ideas out that they know will have an audience with Rioters.\n\nI believe that if the players know that their voice will be heard through this \"official\" platform, the posts that say \"riot never listens\" \"riot doesn't read this\" etc will decrease and give way to constructive discussions.\n\nEach week that a topic is brought to the Q&A Thread, the community would respond in it's original thread to Riots answers with their own rebuttals. The rebuttals with the most up-votes could then be addressed in next weeks Q&A session. The players themselves would ensure only quality rebuttals and and questions would get through to Riot since the players wont want to throw away the opportunity to address Riot Directly.\n\nAt the moment the mentality seems to be, \"Riot isn't listening unless they post directly in my thread.\"\n\nIn terms of Riot directly interacting with players, I don't think that has to stop. There can still be riot started threads and riot chiming in on various posts, which we as a player base love to see.\n\nThank you for your time and commitment to improving the interactions within the community and between Riot and the player base.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sp1n Kuro","date":"2013-09-18T07:32:02.520+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm I like the idea but don't agree with the upvote method. I rarely used the old forums because I didn't like the design but I definitely have good ideas for how to improve the board.\n\n\nI think it should just be a heavily moderated post with silly comments that don't bring in valuable discussion being deleted. And also have a \"slowmode\" on where people can only post once in it per 30mins-1hr.","replies":[{"poster":"Montag","date":"2013-09-18T16:02:57.572+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Slowmode is interesting. A cool feature of this platform is the ability -- in the future -- for different communities to operate under different rules. Imagine a community where OPs and replies had a required minimum length and you were only ever allowed to post a certain number of times per day or at a certain rate. It could be an interesting experiment to see if it produced really high quality, long-form content from contributors.\n\nWe definitely appreciate you sharing these ideas with us.
