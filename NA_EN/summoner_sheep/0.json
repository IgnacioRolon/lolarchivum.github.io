However, when I went to the [patch notes](https://www.surrenderat20.net/2019/10/1014-pbe-update-tentative-balance.html) and saw the only thing they are changing is increasing is her shield by 20 and the damage on it by 40 (at max rank) I couldn't have been more disappointed. I max Q > W > E on Lulu, so this isn't going to help me much, and shields/healing SUCK as a game-mechanic design. There are plenty of areas of Lulu that could have been touched up besides her shield. Here's a list of some of the things you could have done to buff Lulu:\n\n* **Quality of life change** - put a timer on Help, Pix! to show how long the duration of Pix will be on its target.\n* **Ult Combos** - Hitting enemies with Lulu's ult while they are under the duration of one of her CC abilities has additional effects. If the target is slowed by Giltterlance and then hit by the Wild Growth knock-up, they take additional damage from all incoming damage while in the slow-area of effect. If the target is poly morphed and then hit by the Wild Growth knock-up, their damage is reduced while in the slow-area of the effect.\n* **Whimsy** - When used on an ally target while they are recalling, the back-timer is reduced by 10/20/30/40/50% while the ability is active on them.\n* **Glitterlance** - If the target is hit by Glitterlance mark the target for 10 seconds. If the target is hit again by glitterlance deal an additional 1/2/3/4/5% damage and reduce the decay of the slow, stacking up to 3 times.\n\nI'm sure there are some Lulu players who will be thrilled about the shield buff, but I would have much happier seeing the dynamic of her game-play changed.","replies":[{"poster":"The entire team","date":"2019-10-16T21:32:07.757+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The shield part is enough for now.

I'm disappointed.\"\nThat is literally you. Relax. If Riot feels like she needs a bit more after the buff then they will probably add a little more. Better to make a champion gradually better rather than to overload them in one patch.","replies":[{"poster":"Summoner Sheep","date":"2019-10-16T21:13:49.865+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"nooperton","date":"2019-10-16T21:18:17.573+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Woahhhh dont call people idiots.

He was also trying to be nice about it and explaining the buffing process. Then you decided to outright call him a \"flaming idiot\".

Just because you don't max E first or second, doesn't mean others don't. I myself max E first, since I believe It's her second strongest ability and It's good for leashing. Just appreciate that she's receiving a buff.","replies":[]},{"poster":"nooperton","date":"2019-10-16T21:10:12.120+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Damn i hate when my main gets buffed too. Oh? But wait... theres more... the entire support role is getting buffed by not having to spend gold to upgrade their support item? Why buff the role at all or lulu at all if neither are going to dominate the meta? SMH riot I cant believe I thought you were going to completely brake your game by giving my champion massive buffs.\n\nAs a kayn main I think his Q damage shoudlve been increased by AT LEAST 200 base damage and a 100%AD ratio increase, instead of only 15 damage.
