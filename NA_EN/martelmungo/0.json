This has happened multiple times too me, and I am done. You will never get a purchase of riot points from me until I do not experience this problem for at least a year. \r\n\r\nAll clients should be sharing data as other major game companies do, to prevent overload of their actual download servers. \r\n\r\nThis is unacceptable. I've tried the old client, the admin version of both, checked my connection with multiple throttling sites and speeds tests. No problem on my side. Tried doing this off a ram drive, an ssd and a hdd... unacceptable.","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2017-08-24T18:12:14.374+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I definitely feel your frustration.  It seems complete bullshit that its taking as long as it does with a solid connection.  \n\nWe constantly monitor our patching servers and how long it takes players to download the latest patch or the entire installation.  We haven't noticed any particular problems this particular patch and our patcher servers aren't overloaded at all.  There are a lot of players able to download the game at a pretty fast speed, so it doesn't seem like it is a server issue.\n\nAs to why your computer could have a problem downloading league even though internet speed tests all come up positive is that the download speed is entirely dependent on how reliable your connection is to our patcher servers specifically.  If you aren't able to establish a solid and stable connection, the speed may suffer.  The best way to rule this out as a possible root cause is to run through all of the steps in our [Connection Issues Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664).  There are a lot of steps found there, but they are the most common solutions to getting your patching speed back up to where it should be.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CatOptimist","date":"2017-10-23T23:53:39.229+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"65 minutes only!?! It took me 65+ HOURS!! And now the patch is loading super slow as well. At least LoL downloaded, but it's the patch downloading that's the problem. Gets to 45% and then back to 0%. \n\n\n(And yes, I'm new to LoL,)","replies":[]}]}
