Reinstalled the entire game delete all old files, even installed it on a different drive, chat still shows up blue as it just did in this picture. \r\nAlso I've been using left click to move for a very long time, is that not the common practice because I was in an aram and suddenly could not move with the left click anymore and had to right click, is that normal? Like is the default right click to move?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-08-15T18:10:10.455+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It seems like your configuration settings might be messed up.  Though you reinstalled, your settings are still sync'd to our servers.  Performing a config reset might help with this:\n\nLog into the game client.\nNavigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\nDelete the file  named **game.cfg** and **persistedsettings.json**\nGo into a custom game and verify that settings have saved properly.  Leave game to sync settings. \n\nYou can also swap your attack and move buttons as well in-game now.  While in-game, select Hotkeys in the options menu and scroll all the way to to bottom.  I hope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"Martelmungo","date":"2017-08-17T01:05:05.832+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So I did that and it still does not work, but further. When I try to bind MB1 it will not bind to anything.  I have a logitech performance mx mouse. So I just downloaded the software for the mouse, and even swapping the mouse buttons does not work. Yet the game clearly recognized the mouse button one, because I can upgrade abilities, and single click buy shop items, and move across the map. \n\nThis happened about 8 months ago,something like that, I had to force bind mouse button one, using the config settings file by typing it in... \n\nI am going to try that now, but that still means there is a problem, and my chat still is not working. I also just did a game repair and nothing changed. I even reset defaults. So I guess I'll go edit the config file.","replies":[{"poster":"Martelmungo","date":"2017-08-17T01:24:02.482+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I did the binding from the config  it worked my chat still does not pop up, which is sad.
