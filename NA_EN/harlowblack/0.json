The area is still experiencing problems as I ran a trace route last night and got 90% of my packets dropped. \n\nThe temporary work around is to use a VPN and re-route the connection around that node.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-21T00:06:12.377+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been noticing quite a few login issues today, and I've been told by a couple players that some of it might in fact be caused by some kind of issue with ISP's. I want to go ahead and take a look at what your connection is looking like after it leaves your network, so let's run a trace route to our NA server at 104.160.131.1 using something like [WinMTR](http://winmtr.net/winmtr-v0-92-now-available/).

The last thread it looked like we narrowed down the issue to it being linked to being routed through Denver. But apparently it's still messed up despite that all. We'll see if it gets sorted soon. Can't really do anything on our side, my ISP says there's nothing they can do either.\n{{sticker:zombie-nunu-bummed}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hello301","date":"2017-08-20T18:11:52.423+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"happened to me last week changing date on my computer back a few days worked haven't tried it yet, but I'm getting the same error.
