His wave-shoving ability is way better with the new W, so you can be a bit more of a threat while your opponent roams. You have to max W now I think, so you don't get access to the better cooldown and spammability of the E until later (level13). \n\nGetting used to holding W until the mark is cooked is really tricky, because you're probably in the habit of pressing Q-W at the same time or E-then W as you land. Now you just hold the W for the auto-reset and cooked mark damage. \n\nThe other nice thing is that, since you aren't maxing E as your primary damage tool, you don't have any mana issues. This means a lichbane rush is a little bit easier to do. Lichbane + cooked level 5 W is a surprisingly big chunk of burst. Add protobelt for that sweet bonus mobility and it's pretty solid.","replies":[{"poster":"AmazoX","date":"2016-11-03T05:10:58.697+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you the guy who got a job at Riot as analyst and said you'll prove Riot Games mathematically that Yasuo is overloaded?
