Unfortunately, Riots matchmaking system has given me a endless slew of drunks, ragers, boosted accounts, and general incompetents on my team. Every game I get placed with these people and my team (including my fleeting positive attitude) gets dunked into the dumpster so hard that D-man himself would be jealous. This isn't \"Oh my teammates are trash and I can't carry them\", these are all normal games. I want to play Yorick and have fun, I don't want to play Renekton and be the tryhard hard carry guy in a normals game. However, it's gotten to the point that i'm getting placed with people that are no where near my skill bracket AT ALL and it's every, single, game. I want to be positive but even I can't contain my inner IWD when my entire team has a .33 KDA ratio and are doing to the same &amp;%$# over and over again and flaming me. \n\nIn my last game I completely lost it, my team is at this point making me borderline insane at this point and the enemy team has destroyed all of our inhibit. The enemy ADC Draven asks us \"How are the minions going?\" as their minions swam our base, I respond: \"I couldn't tell, they look like my team\". The enemy team gets a good chuckle out of that and my team is still crying and raging like 11 year old COD kids who just got told by their parents that they are taking their Xbox. A few minutes the game ends (take a guess who won) and I type this in the post game lobby \"Call the San-Diego zoo, I think I found their missing Chimpanzees\". At this point the enemy team is crying and all my teammates have disconnected at this point. I am currently typing this post with 3 friend requests from the enemy team and praying to the Flying Spaghetti monster so he may grant me teammates that I can work with and are at my skill level (slightly more intelligent then a Frog).","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-05-25T22:03:03.101+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is this blind pick?

Ideally I rush Trinity into Visage or Deadmans but that tends to change especially since everyone and their mother plays Fiora and Renekton top. Masteries are usually constant and Runes are subject to slight changes as well.\n\nYorick has been pushed out of the meta which forces me to become more adaptive to the enemy top laner. I will probably play less Yorick simply because he's really not good in this meta and since it seems like blind pick isn't a good idea atm (getting counter picked against Yorick is not my idea of a good time).\n\nI haven't played the new Rammus and Zac so as soon as I win a game as Yorick I'm going to be spamming those two most likely. The new Zac looks sooooooo good.","replies":[{"poster":"SnakDatSmilesBak","date":"2017-05-25T22:17:39.842+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yorick was NEVER meta, but he's still my babe. If you're having trouble against renekton and fiora, try using warlord's bloodlust or fervor. Ghouls stack fervor and Yorick loves movespeed. You'll never beat fiora or renekton going so deep into the defensive tree.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Galvatron","date":"2017-05-25T22:38:47.679+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yorick was meta before patch 7.8 primarily in Korea as a split pusher afk top lane. Unfortunately Divers like Renekton and Fiora got a metic ton of indirect buffs with the item changes and now are really difficult to deal with. I have tried Fervor and Warlords but the issue is that it's your all dmg vs their all dmg which you will lose almost every time due to their superior innate sustain and your weakness to prolonged trades pre 6. The tech I do is ok vs them (especially Fiora when you bait her parry) but it is the fact that I can no longer hard carry using him even if I am ahead. The items and meta are simply no longer in his favor.\n\nThe bigger issue is that I can't rely on my teammates _**at all**_ to help me/compensate for any small mistakes I make. It's basically a 1v5 and any mistake I make auto losses the fight. Merritt I need to kinda shake off the rust I have accumulated over a month so I don't see anything in my control being a pressing issue that needs to be fixed. I just want matchmaking to give me people I can work with and are not Tinfoil 15.","replies":[{"poster":"SnakDatSmilesBak","date":"2017-05-25T22:53:33.610+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm I did not know Yorick was meta in Korea and before 7.8 thanks for correcting me. Yeah I know yorick is hard to play top.
