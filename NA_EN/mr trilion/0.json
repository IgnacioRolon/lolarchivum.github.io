But when my timer says 12 min remaining, the timer resets itself to 20 min... \nPicture: http://prntscr.com/hc19nn\nFirst I thought that this was a bugg so I left queue en rejoined it, I waited till 12 min remaining and the timer reset itself again to 20min...\n\nThen I restarted my game and tried it again, without any succession...\n\nNow I have waited 24 min and I need to wait 10 more minute's to start my game..\nPicture: http://prntscr.com/hc1be1\n\nCan someone explain to why?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-11-18T22:15:53.261+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"This could happen if you're having connection issues that's causing you to lose comms with matchmaking while waiting to queue.  Leaverbuster is good at catching what could otherwise have been another leave, so it may be a good idea to stick to customs for now and troubleshoot this.  Run through our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide which should fix this up.  You also have 3 games left of [leaverbuster](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ), so you'll see the lower priority queue for a few more matches.\n\nWhile you troubleshoot, I've created a ticket for you as well.  This will allow our tech team to work with you directly and see if there's anything else going on, of we can do something for you.  Your ticket number is #32667721.  We'll get back to you there as soon as we can.  :)","replies":[{"poster":"GeoTkas","date":"2018-01-02T22:09:09.190+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Drop the shittalk, if you fail to accept you have to press start again, this system is dead and stupid and you know it. Same happen to me today and i had to give up after 1 hour of refreshing.\n\nThose queue penalties do not make sense especialy when you havent left a game for 3 months, and they are buggy as hell on top of that.\nReally bad job.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheGibbs3","date":"2017-12-17T02:48:31.336+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey I'm having issues of the same matter as well.

I have had this issue as well. With everything accrued I have now waited the  full punishment to just play one game. Yet still will have another 2 or 3 games I will have to deal with this. I am LAN connected and shouldn't be having any issues. Also the reason I even have this punishment was because I thought I was support and chose brain then realized I was jungle when in game. So I left so that I would receive the loss and loss of Lp only.. which my team was very greatful for but at this point I may as well have just played and lost because I wouldn't be waiting over 2 hours just to play. This isn't right. You definitely have an issue with the system you guys need to address. I've seen posts dating 3 years back for the same issue. It's obvious you guys just don't care","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"liquidhentai","date":"2018-01-02T02:32:40.160+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"the same thing is happening to me as well","replies":[{"poster":"Yalathanil","date":"2018-01-02T03:06:30.888+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"same","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Thx202","date":"2017-12-27T22:02:41.167+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have the same roblem im trying to get into a game for 2 hours with no success.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Waryapple101","date":"2017-12-17T16:02:09.516+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm having the same problem, I hope it gets fixed soon.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Emperor Mo","date":"2017-11-18T20:28:07.062+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been getting the same problem as well, I think there is an actual bug.\n\nTimer pic - https://prnt.sc/hc7el2","replies":[]},{"poster":"KÃ¨nchUnbenched","date":"2018-01-26T02:51:20.730+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Me too...

ALL of my other computer games run fine LOL on the other hand ms spikes up to 9000+ or i will just DC. There is 0 reason for me to play a game with everything looking like a powerpoint slide my team would benefit more without me being there hell yea i'm going to leave. I would just stop playing altogether but for most of the time i thought it wouldn't be worth it to learn DOTA or HON but now it is looking much more appealing. terrible ping, horrible bugs not to mention 3v3 is just full of bots but you seem to care more about me leaving a game that consequently would benefit my team. This leave buster refreshing at around 8 min is Fucking unacceptable though. If you expect me to be perfect then you (riot) should practice what you fucking preach. maybe there should be \"bullshit buster\" for riot, every time you fuck up you refund some of my god damn money.","replies":[]}]}
