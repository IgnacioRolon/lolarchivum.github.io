I've done practically everything and it still does not work.","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem began this morning when I launched the game and signed in normally. I closed it after a while and when i tried to open it it wouldn't open. I re-installed it and still nothing. The league og legend's logo would stuck on the screen without responding, once I clicked it it would always say\"PVP.NET Kernel not responding \" (something among those lines). I proceeded to re-install it again and run it as an administrator a few times until it finally, took me to the home page where it said launch. I hit launch but the percentage was at 0 and the homepage was black (no thumbnails, etc.) After a while of deactivating my antivirus, giving permission to the firewall, deactivating the firewall, deleting every file,and reinstalling the game It finally worked, but my home page was still a black screen. I played a couple of games, (couldn't access the shop either, was a black screen too) theN quit, when I went to launch the game again it was back to square one. Same problem and still can't fix it. SOMEBODY HELP.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-16T05:59:38.160+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This sounds an awful like a poor connection to the servers is preventing your client from loading assets from the servers and preventing you from accessing specific services within the client.
