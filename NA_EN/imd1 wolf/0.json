Are the rates in which you can receive chests and the rates in which you receive key fragments really that lopsided? \n\nIn my opinion it should be much more balanced. What does everyone else think?\n\nAgain this is based on earning every available chest since the system was implemented, If you do not earn all the chests then the rates may be balanced, so please answer the poll with this in mind.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-12-13T22:22:05.771+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can't speak much for chests because it will depend on the type of chest you're trying to get.  Mastery chest drops are limited to how many chest icons you have available for the week, but key fragments do vary in rate.  It's about 12 key fragments per ~28 days per the [hextech crafting](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207884233-Hextech-Crafting-Guide) guide.  You could get more fragments with honor capsules, though.  The rate of key fragments will slow down the more you receive them until that ~28 day refresh.  I hope that helps clear things up!","replies":[{"poster":"ImD1 Wolf","date":"2017-12-13T22:36:04.286+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"After looking at some of the other Help and Support posts I do not know if this one should be in here...
