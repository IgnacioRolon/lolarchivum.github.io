He never received a ward skin or icon at his release and it would be epic to have a little more Rumble love with a nice icon of him. Just a trivial thing - but was wondering if this could be possible in the future.\n\nFinal Boss Veigar got his staff added as an icon when Arcade Riven and Battleboss Blitzcrank were added despite having released over a year ago. Can SG Rumble get his own summoner icon as well likewise? {{champion:68}} ","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-05-13T17:33:47.636+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"We don't have plans to create a SG Rumble icon.
