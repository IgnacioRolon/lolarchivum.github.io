I am not sure wether these quotes are scrapped or not as I have checked several posts asking this question and all seem to have gone unanswered, and also apparently unfixed either because I have played over 400 games on sion with said skin and not heard these lines. Can a riot member please confirm to me wether they were removed or not? thanks","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-26T21:51:18.515+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not sure about whether or not those VO's were just removed for that skin or not, but I'd suggest posting this over in Report a Bug to make sure this gets noticed by the right people.","replies":[{"poster":"EPiKDJ","date":"2017-06-26T22:22:09.480+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For mecha Sion. his slam's icon is smaller than the actual hitbox itself. I can clearly sidestep it and be out of the visual but still get hit. So either his skin needs to be disabled during ranked or just needs a visual fix. Countless times players admitted to that being the reason they got the skin","replies":[]}]}]}
