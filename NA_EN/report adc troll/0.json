I am from Mexico but I've always played in NA with a ping between 50-70 ms which has been fine for me, since I experience no delays on clicking. But since this patch came out, I've had a flat 180 ms ping non stop, and everything I click in game, takes a second or 2 to happen. I have also tested with my LAN account but the ping is the same.\r\nI've read people complaining about lag spikes so I assume I'm probably not the only one, is there anyone experiencing this problem with this new patch, or is it just me?\r\n\r\nRiotPLZ fix   {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{champion:32}}","replies":[{"poster":"FiTA","date":"2016-02-18T22:14:11.788+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"no its not just you. i've been having a massive ping. already reported to riot but still wont do anything. its been almost a week all of my games are 500ms highest ive got was around 4k i have screenshot just to prove it","replies":[]},{"poster":"SentAchilles47","date":"2016-03-03T13:30:11.783+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've normally experienced around 250ms on LoL but ever since patch 6.3 I've shot up to around 310ms or if I'm very lucky - 290ms. I live in SE Asia, but Garena is useless as the only way I can play is in a different language therefore I'm forced to play in servers on the other side of the world (such a stupid way to provide Asian players LoL, and it doesn't even work, in Malaysia's Garena, I'm still stuck with 200ms even with 30mb/s internet and Singapore's won't even let more than half the community log in to their accounts.) Though this may be seen as shocking enough, not only has the latency gone up, but just general in game lag that makes no sense relating to the ms in the top right. RIOT please fix this ASAP or you'll be losing a very high paying member of your community and maybe even more. Disappointing to see my ms go UP even more in patch 6.4. :(","replies":[{"poster":"SentAchilles47","date":"2016-03-03T13:31:57.199+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Might as well switch to fuckin playing SMITE or DotA 2.

LoL is probably by FAR the worst game I have ever dealt with when it comes to lag issues. No other game I've played even comes close to the amount of lag issues that LoL keeps having. I went from having 13 ping to 70-80 ping after the server move. Now I'm sitting at an awesome 180-250 ping. This game is literally unplayable for me right now.

I've been feeling the EXACT same issue. I knew I wasn't the only one. Since the new patches, (6.xxx), I've been feeling this unplayable lag. I've contacted Riot Support and I've followed the assistance guides, and nothing; I'm quite desperate, because I have more than 3 years playing this game, and this is by far the worst issues I've ever had. I contacted also my ISP and they said nothing was wrong. You know what's the worst part? That I play with 80-90 ms and 50-60 FPS, and it shows me that in the info on the top right corner. And when I try to do whatever kind of match, I can't play! It seems like if I were playing +2000 ms and 20 FPS. (And I can see what others do! And it still shows me the \"80 ms and 60 FPS.).\nSo, please we beg for assistance. Not only for pro players, but for the ones that just wanna have fun.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ioku","date":"2016-02-19T05:05:43.674+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm getting this too, everynight around 7pm pacific I start shooting up to 130+ sometimes 200+.

Have you guys happened to try Riot's Connection KB yet? It sometimes helps with high ping and lag: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues\n\nIf you go through the steps and that doesn't seem to work for you, I suggest you send in a ticket to Riot support for extra help. \n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-rainbows}}","replies":[]}]}
