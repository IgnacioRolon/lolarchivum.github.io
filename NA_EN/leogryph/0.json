Please reconnect to the game.\" screen show up after out game ended. We lost, the defeat sign showed up and we clicked to go to post match lobby as usual. The stats weren't showing up after a couple of minutes so we chose to skip. After that the screen popped up and has persisted through multiple relogging attempts. Actually attempting to reconnect results in a black screen and nothing loads. Is there anything we should do?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-05T20:59:13.274+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you guys might be playing from the same area; though, I can't say for sure. The issues you're explaining here, especially the black screen, strongly suggests that your network is having trouble maintaining a connection to our servers.  I recommend you guys go over the [connection issues ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues)guide to tune up your connection and get this fixed up.

It looks like this was a result of ghost games, meaning the server failed to communicate the end of the match.  There are a few ways to force an update and get this resolved:\n\n- Log out completely then back in\n-  Restarting your computer\n- Waiting for the server to update on its own, which can take up to 2 hours.\n\nOnce the update has kicked in, there may be a delay in updating your game stats and IP earned.  It's a crappy situation, and hopefully you can get back in with the first two steps.","replies":[{"poster":"Athenian Goddess","date":"2016-08-05T23:24:56.714+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"By update the client, do you mean \"repair\" it?","replies":[{"poster":"Leogryph","date":"2016-08-05T23:42:41.761+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I believe they just mean the servers will update themselves.
