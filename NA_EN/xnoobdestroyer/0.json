They never die in a 1v1 unless you're VERY fed or if you're playing {{champion:67}} ,{{champion:90}} , or very stacked {{champion:45}}  and can deal so much damage if you're not a tank yourself. If I'm not fed I have trouble with them in late laning phase (around 8-10 mins probably) where they get tons of armor and they suddenly outdamage me and I'm zoned from all farm because as I said they do a lot of damage with just one combo. I know jungle ganks are very good against tanks since tanks don't have much mobility but you can't always rely on junglers.  In teamfights I get the concept of trying to avoid the tanks and going for the real damage dealers and they you can melt the tank afterwards, but I'm in bronze and my team will just go for the tank most of the time. I want some good tips for how to deal with tanks in laning phase once they get armor.","replies":[{"poster":"LetMeCarry1983","date":"2018-05-12T01:19:44.380+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you can't beat 'em.

So having even a little bit of MR will allow you to actually negate a good chunk of their damage as they are only building resistances and health.\n\nChampions that excel vs Tanks you didn't mention though: {{champion:63}} {{champion:69}} {{champion:164}} {{champion:114}} {{champion:11}} {{champion:48}} {{champion:254}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:122}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:150}}  to name a few.\n\nItems such as: {{item:3151}} {{item:3036}} {{item:3135}} {{item:3071}}  or simply again, just building a Mr item (or Armor if it's like Sion)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tremaursen","date":"2019-02-19T06:59:22.342+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's some good advice in this thread, bit you really stated their greatest weakness already, your own team. Tanks are obnoxious because they need to be. They NEED high base stats to contest other classes in lane to prevent those classes from spiraling out of control with damage. It's design by necessity that they have an easier time in lane because whenever that changes  other classes have too easy of a time scaling and the whole game suffers for it (bruiser+Conq meta anyone?)\n\nSo instead of worrying about the 1v1s in lane, worry about the weakness you can exploit out of the tank role in the mid and late game. Tanks thrive in the center of teamfights, so work with your team beforehand to prevent them from aquiring the resources they need to do so. Have your team prioritise their anti tank strengths if you know tanks are going to be a problem. Even if that just means communicating not to be nunched up vs Sej, it will help.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Diing","date":"2019-02-19T06:38:20.258+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I might not be high elo, but from my experience carries with anti tank abilities still can't out trade tanks.
