We also listened to the &quot;**very informed**&quot; testers who told us Skarner was weak. Feedback is always contingent upon the choices made by the playtester.

I was incorrect. &quot;_\r\n- CertainlyT\r\n\r\n**very informed.\r\n**\r\n\r\nThis. this here hurts. Riot trusted us on the PBE to give informed data and feedback but we... no, I did not look at all the angles. I was one of the major voices on the forums that influenced the rework. I assumed my winning on the pbe with new skarner was not because he was unbalanced or broken, but because I lived and breathed that champion on live. And as one so used to that specific champion I never once took into account _&quot;how would someone with NO experience with Skarner do?_&quot;. I now assume that this was the same mindset of the rest of the PBE testers as well. \r\n\r\nI have only played one game of skarner since he came live since then, and that was back when the win % hadn&#039;t become apparent. i couldn&#039;t even look at him after i realised what we had brought to LIVE. i dont know if ill play him again.\r\n\r\nI have not been able to log onto the pbe forums, maybe my account got removed. And honestly? I deserve that if it is the case. We failed to give proper feedback from all the angles and now skarner will be dealt with accordingly . \r\n\r\nI&#039;m sorry CertainlyT, I know you are not quick to take advice from the forums and one of the few times you do you get this... thing.\r\nHad to get that off my chest. that is all.\r\n\r\nGood luck on the fields of Justice!","replies":[{"poster":"redniwediS","date":"2015-09-09T20:24:38.380+0000","up_votes":42,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've said it ever since I first was allowed on the PBE; the PBE is not a good place to judge live balance.

As we all know this didn't happen.\n\nEveryone makes mistakes, and given the wildly different meta (or partial lack there of) on the PBE everything that comes off of it should come with a \"results may vary\" tag on it.  Mistakes are part of the learning experience.\n\nI really hope CertainlyT didn't intend for that bit quoted to sound the way it does, because it reads as if he is trying to shift blame away from the balance team and onto the testers.  I'll say it again, mistakes happen, and no one is truly to blame for an honest mistake.\n\nChanges were made, feedback was given, and it was a bad fit for the live server environment so future corrections will likely happen.

We just post it to the PBE forums/that one buglist topic and hope it gets noticed in the massive storm (Instance 1.  I reported a massive manamura bug where it would always get doublekills on \"revive\" champs with a 100% success rate after it was first introduced.

Big one that comes to mind, but I've seen it time and time again, not only with mine, but with other people's post/issues, to the point I just sort of... stopped.  I understand that the PBE is shyt for balance.  That just comes from an enviroment where everywhere from challengers to bronze can mix freely and cause vastly different skill levels to intermingle, you can't even get a feel for balance.
