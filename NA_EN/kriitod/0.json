But when I complete the round I don't seem to be able to to receive IP.

They're essentially the same, but you don't get BE after every single match. Playing games helps push you towards leveling up your summoner level, and each time you level up you get capsules with champion shards. Those shards can be disenchanted for Blue Essence.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kokua","date":"2018-01-12T02:38:41.426+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"IP was converted over to the new BE system, or Blue Essence. You obtain capsules when you level up, which gives you  champion shards. Those champion shards can be used to obtain champions at a discounted price, or disenchanted to get Blue Essence, which serves every purpose IP used to, and more. Instead of getting them per game, you get them per level. It comes less often, but in bulk amounts, and you actually gain more in the new system compared to the old.","replies":[{"poster":"kriitod","date":"2018-01-12T03:45:08.316+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you very much!
