Players are still, myself included, having issues with this. And, it is still the same run of the mill bs being force fed to the community. You are at fault. Your pc. Your connection. You. You. And only you. It is abundantly clear that you guys have no desire to keep any of your players. So long as there is still a decent base of players to buy into things and throw money at the game, it ultimately is a small problem to deal with by RIOT and those under RIOT's employment.  Ridiculous, guys and gals. Fooooking Ridiculous.","replies":[{"poster":"Xaeros","date":"2017-11-10T21:21:03.990+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, welcome back, Greenlightgo22 :)\n\nRiot broke \"World of Tanks\" now?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-11-10T21:17:27.807+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It looks like your client found some bad files and trying to fix them, so it may not be exclusive to your PC hardware.
