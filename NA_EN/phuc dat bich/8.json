My solution here is ether buff the big or the blue runes that provide magic penetration\n\nOR new set up of runes that provide magic penetration the yellow ones (ATM we dont have yellow runes that provide magic penetration) The yellow they would give 5 magic penetration (9 YELLOW=5 MAGIC PENETRATION)","replies":[{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-05-09T09:18:32.695+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Max you can get with ArP is 59 and that's Ghostblade, Brutalizer, 19 from runes, and 10 from Warrior Enchant.
