Gragas wasn't worth complaining about before. Now he is, because he's not the same champion he was a few months back.","replies":[{"poster":"Jamaree","date":"2015-05-10T01:56:39.301+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I didn't realize having your slow slight increase, 50 more damage to minions with one ability and a 30% decrease of damage to minions to another would cause a champion to suddenly become broken.","replies":[{"poster":"Abyssphere","date":"2015-05-10T02:08:38.658+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Jamaree,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=oe51ad4E,comment-id=000000020000,timestamp=2015-05-10T01:56:39.301+0000)\n>\n> I didn't realize having your slow slight increase, 50 more damage to minions with one ability and a 30% decrease of damage to minions to another would cause a champion to suddenly become broken.\n\nHis total buffs were:\n- Barrel Roll slow increased by 10% at all ranks (15% increase if left to charge) - these are significant amounts, particularly for a jungler because it increases lockdown potential and reduces the ability for the enemy champ to escape a gank\n- Drunken Rage damage to monsters buffed by 50 - not a huge change, it increases clear speed but not greatly\n- Base mana increased by 100 - huge buff, massively increases the amount he can do early gank-wise, clear-wise and everything else\n\nSure none of the buffs were insane but he got improved in three different areas, ALL of which are particularly beneficial for a jungler. Combine that with Cinderhulk being very strong and you just cannot compare him to the champion he used to be. \n\nThere are a lot of cases where people complain about champions that were considered weak at one point and hadn't got changes to make them better - a good example of that is Cho'Gath, who has received only one small change and largely has the same itemisation he used to have, yet is suddenly considered too strong. But Gragas isn't one of those cases, he is significantly better than he was a few months ago and if you don't believe that then I think you fail to see the power of his buffs. Three separate buffs and significantly changed itemisation can do huge amounts for any champion.\n\nI mean even if you do want to put down his solo q banrate to people playing him in the LCS - there is a good reason Gragas jungle is in the competitive meta now, but wasn't before.","replies":[{"poster":"Jamaree","date":"2015-05-10T02:36:58.871+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Then I assume we are just going to ignore the nerf that came along that nerfed his damage to minions from his Q because reasons, but whatever.","replies":[{"poster":"Abyssphere","date":"2015-05-10T02:53:59.027+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Jamaree,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=oe51ad4E,comment-id=00000002000000000000,timestamp=2015-05-10T02:36:58.871+0000)\n>\n> Then I assume we are just going to ignore the nerf that came along that nerfed his damage to minions from his Q because reasons, but whatever.\n\nYou're not really replying to much of what I've said. Getting nerfed in the past doesn't mean a champ can't be strong again. And funnily enough having his damage to lane minions nerfed does little to nerf Gragas as a jungler.","replies":[{"poster":"Jamaree","date":"2015-05-10T03:02:38.575+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It was a 30% decrease to all minions, lane and jungle.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Phuc Dat Bich","date":"2015-05-09T23:19:27.463+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Jamaree,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=oe51ad4E,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-05-09T23:07:20.523+0000)\n>\n> Question, why didn't you why about nerfs those few months he wasn't played...at all?\n\nmaybe because riot buff him and release the new jungle item? yeah do you need more? \n\nRiot buff his E-Q damage/mana cost CDs and some quality buffs to his Q\n\nplus the new jungle item\n\nYeah that why he is broken atm!!\n\nor he is not? in every pro game and in every division in solo Q he is banned/picked...","replies":[{"poster":"Shroom Junkie","date":"2015-05-10T01:55:02.145+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=GG WP EZ GAME,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=oe51ad4E,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2015-05-09T23:19:27.463+0000)\n>\n> maybe because riot buff him and release the new jungle item? yeah do you need more? \n> \n> Riot buff his E-Q damage/mana cost CDs and some quality buffs to his Q\n> \n> plus the new jungle item\n> \n> Yeah that why he is broken atm!!\n> \n> or he is not? in every pro game and in every division in solo Q he is banned/picked...\n\n\"and release the new jungle item?\"\n\"plus the new jungle item\"\n\nSo you're saying nerf a champion because of an item that can affect all champions?\nkden\n\n\"Riot buff his E-Q damage/mana cost CDs and some quality buffs to his Q\"\n\nThat's because he did barely any damage originally.
