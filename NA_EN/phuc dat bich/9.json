In any form or way. I really did trust that to stick, but having one second chunked off of it? He has no CC other than that silence. It's his only reliable way currently after the upcoming 'rework' that will allow him to stick to an enemy champion. It doesn't make any sense for his silence to get nuked like this. It's hard to hold trust in a company I love when they can't keep a small promise like that.\n\nEven though comparing Garen's silence to Chogaths doesn't really make complete sense, why is it that Chogath gets a knockup, a severely strong slow, a AoE 2.5 second silence, along with a guaranteed, a instantaneous true-damage ultimate with a 70% AP scaling that also grows in range, along with a stacking health benefit? Doesn't that just SCREAM overloaded? while Garen..he gets a 1.5 second silence in his entire kit, and is forced to be only useful against a SOLE target due to the new 'villain' mechanic. \n\nGaren deserves, needs, and SHOULD, keep his 2.5 second silence. Keep its scaling, that at least keeps it beneficially fair -- and don't argue that it isn't fair. He doesn't have nearly as much CC as any other champion out there. He relies on that for his safety and stick. This is especially the case with E making him SLOWER if he ticks an enemy with a hit. It's literally going to make him too immobile to stick to any champion. I can't believe that the reasoning behind Garens silence getting nerfed is 'to get his full combo off'. \n\nANYONE, can get their full combo off, if they're able to catch an opponent off guard. Hello? Where do you think the Garen in a Bush joke came from? His stick when catching an opponent off-guard is 100% deserved. If you get outplayed and walk into a trap or awaiting enemy champion, you DESERVE, to get  full-combo'd, resulting in your death. \n\nSeriously. Rethink your method here, Repertoir. You've always been reliable in your position -- I know, i've followed and loved the work you've done. But I know well enough that YOU know, tearing the silence from his kit when everyone was promised it would stay (BECAUSE it's his ONLY CC) is a stupid, and rash decision.\n\n If you look at Garen in comparison to Cho, like others have mentioned here..How exactly is it fair that Cho gets 3 CC capabilities, one of them being a hard CC at that, and a true-damage nuke with SCALING? And a health-raising benefit? While Garen gets a fixed damage execute which is worthless unless the enemy is below 30% health. \n\nWhile we're at it. Could we talk about the revert on Garens W? I thought this was addressed simply under the reasoning of 'scaling/stacking benefits are toxic'? What was wrong with Garen's W as it currently is? You're making him squishier and more worthless -- Taking his W destroys his late-game durability scaling. This didn't need to change either. No offense..But Garen was 100% healthy, and fine as-is. All he needed were QoL changes, or late-game buffs...Not complete and utter gutting.","replies":[{"poster":"RiotRepertoir","date":"2015-08-10T04:43:15.014+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"> The community was promised that Garens silence wouldn't be touched. In any form or way.\n\nFrom what I understand, any messaging about Garen's update said his Silence would still be there, not necessarily that it would go untouched in any way, shape, or form. Can you show me where we said that? Because that seems like a big goof up on our end if that's the case. So, on that topic, yeah, no one should have promised that :(\n\n> If you look at Garen in comparison to Cho, like others have mentioned here..How exactly is it fair that Cho gets 3 CC capabilities, one of them being a hard CC at that, and a true-damage nuke with SCALING? And a health-raising benefit? While Garen gets a fixed damage execute which is worthless unless the enemy is below 30% health.\n\nThough historically we haven't made many efforts to differentiate between tanks like Cho'Gath and tanky guys like Garen, we're trying to establish that differentiation to some extent. Though we haven't really investigated Cho'Gath directly yet, he falls much more toward the general idea of what a tank is. Durable, heavy crowd control, and low sustained damage (though his sustained damage may be too high for this to be true). Garen, on the other hand, is being pushed toward a much higher sustained damage pattern than he's ever had in the past, to the point that we're classifying him as a carry. I think we can probably agree that carries shouldn't have a high level of crowd control, though it doesn't necessarily follow that a 2.5 second silence is a 'high level of crowd control.' Maybe Cho does too much damage for a tank or is unfair in some other way (like his silence duration), but it's probably not the best idea to reduce Cho's silence duration because we're reducing Garen's, and it's also probably not the best idea to think we have to leave Garen's silence alone because there are other characters whose silences are longer.\n\nI will say this about the duration reduction on Garen's silence. I lowered it to a duration that felt fair given the higher damage the character will now do. Is 1.5 seconds too low? Possibly, but it definitely wasn't reduced because Riot doesn't like silence. With his upcoming changes, we're trying to put him in a spot where he can be seen as a real threat, and less of a guy whose usefulness falls off dramatically as the game goes on. If we're not hitting that mark after his release, I'll try to calibrate upward.\n\n> While we're at it. Could we talk about the revert on Garens W?

All he needed were QoL changes, or late-game buffs...Not complete and utter gutting.\n\nThis update aims to increase Garen's affinity for Health items, and flat resistances are a good way to do that. Maybe this just reads as a nerf or something, but in almost all cases, it's just not. I sure don't think 'scaling/stacking benefits are toxic,' and if that was formerly our stance, we have changed a lot in the past few years, and the game has too. Overall, he should not be squishier, except in the case of full tank builds. As to 'complete and utter gutting,' that seems to imply the character is going to fall to a sub 45% win rate or something. With the changes going in, I'd be truly surprised if it was closer to 45% than 55%. I could be wrong here, but we're _definitely_ not aiming for a gutting, or even a nerf at all. If he comes out and proves to be weak, I'll be happy to admit we missed the mark on him, and buff him up a bit, probably in places where we took some stuff away.","replies":[{"poster":"Auryiel","date":"2015-08-10T06:33:27.854+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wish you were in charge of the Morde rework like omfg how much more open and nice can you be? ;-;","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Earl Eulrich","date":"2015-08-10T03:05:58.747+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the main thing here is: isn´t the main focus on your juggernaut rework that they should be really rewarded for closing the gap? so what´s wrong with Garen unleashing his full combo within the silence once he got close?

Perhaps if you returned some of his team fighting power so that he could be more disruptive or deal more damage to multiple units like Darius and Mordekaiser...but if that's missing the mark on your rework then I don't know what to say other than \"Riot took a stance against tanky assassins and your rework seems to be going against that\".","replies":[{"poster":"RiotRepertoir","date":"2015-08-10T05:56:04.399+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> You want this guy to be a juggernaut, with lots of sustained damage, but his damage is so much higher when he's against a single target that it seems more likely that this guy will end up being played as an assassin.\n\nThough he will now do a lot of damage to a target, Garen lacks the mobility profile and target selection of a real assassin.

Garen has to run at a guy, stick to them for 3 seconds, and then run away. As such, I don't really see him as an assassin.\n\nOkay, that's fair. The question then becomes: What IS your vision for Garen here?\n\nYou want the juggernauts to be unique. Makes sense. So, Garen is supposed to be a tanky damage dealer with poor initiation, low crowd control, who does a lot of single target damage to a fed enemy (but not as much as Mordekaiser) and a little bit of damage to the rest of the enemy team (but not as much as Darius).\n\nDon't get me wrong, the Villain mechanic is cool and I bet it's going to be really useful, but I don't feel like the reward for a juggernaut managing to get to his target should be large single-target damage. \n\nIf it works consistently, then Garen is a tanky assassin, pure and simple. If he is able to reliably reach his target and execute them, then he is a more toxic, more team reliant Diana, and the counterplay to his kit relies on interactions with his teammates, not with him. \n\nIf it does not work consistently, then Garen's reward for reaching the enemy team with the help of his teammates is maybe killing the Villain and dealing some AOE damage to the rest of the enemy team with his E. If they don't CC him, or shield it, or just move out of the way. \n\nYou want Garen to have a stronger boost for actually reaching the enemy team. He's less sticky but he's more greatly rewarded for sticking. But only against one person. \n\nIt just seems counterintuitive. A juggernaut should be like a DPS version of a tank, where rather than crowd control, it's their massive potential to disrupt a team by raw AOE damage that should terrify the enemy and force them to be removed as a threat. \n\nBut Garen's AOE ability is spread out over 3 seconds, easily kitable, short range, and deals less damage to multiple units.\n\nI don't know, maybe I'm just not seeing the reward here. Please explain it to me. If this rework works out EXACTLY as you intend it to, what is the highlight of Garen's gameplay supposed to look like?","replies":[{"poster":"RiotRepertoir","date":"2015-08-10T07:11:06.426+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":">  If this rework works out EXACTLY as you intend it to, what is the highlight of Garen's gameplay supposed to look like?\n\nGaren does the baseline stuff of a Juggernaut (tanky, high damage, low mobility profile) with some additional assassin-like tendencies against a single, semi-random target.\n\nWhen I think about what these Juggernauts are, they should all be really tanky, they should all deal high damage to the enemy team, and they should all be relatively immobile, _PLUS_ one or two additional differentiating aspects (Villainy, in Garen's case).\n\nMaybe the \"increased damage when hitting a single target\" doesn't send a perfect message, but Garen's damage in teamfights should still be on par or higher than these other guys.

He can't have it turned off through silence or interrupting channels, which is good, but it's still pretty easy to just dash away from it, and then he either shuts it off early (which he can't do if he's silenced/stunned, I would imagine) or he has to deal with the full cooldown and have nothing but single target for the next 9 seconds.\n\nMaybe you could make his W more interesting with some more AOE damage? You did talk about adding some AP ratios to Garen's kit. What about giving him a melee range AOE damage field like Jayce's Hammer W? That would be some more reliable AOE damage that would reward Garen for getting into the fight, and also replace some of the power he lost when you took away his Tenacity.","replies":[{"poster":"RiotRepertoir","date":"2015-08-10T07:38:03.119+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really do want to make his W active more interesting in the future, if I get a chance to come back to it and power permits.","replies":[{"poster":"A grizzy bear","date":"2015-08-10T22:26:45.310+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you are looking to make an ability that is meant to be used to help Garen be tanky, why not make the ability have some sort of benefit by being used in combat?

The problem seems to be that his sustained aoe damage is lacking in realistic situations. This way he could attempt his full combo and the enemy team has to really respect that beyond just not getting their villain killed. It would force them to actually deal with him directly a bit more and add more reward to him pulling off his thing which incentivizes your team to help make it happen. It scales great the later and more team fighty the game goes. Adds big potential to his ability to disrupt an enemy team trying to do dragon or baron even if his whole team isn't there to back him up.\n\nMy main concern is that if it requires him to kill the villain specifically to get the reset it won't occur often enough to be more than a pipe dream for most but if it doesn't require that it'll be too easy because in many cases he can just ult the support or something and it could prove too strong. There's also concern that all too often it'll be disappointing because he'll have little or no cd left on his E when he ults.\n\nAnother possibility I just thought of is perhaps rewarding his ult killing the villain in some other way like giving him a temporary \"righteous fury\" buff that causes any enemy champions that damage him to take 10% of that damage themselves.\n\nIt could go a lot of directions really in terms of detail but I suggest it resulting in at least potential aoe damage to the enemy team in some form.\n\nGoing potentially out of your way to kill the villain specifically with your ult shouldn't ever make you feel like you wasted it and now can't do much else to help your team win the rest of the fight.
