{"poster":"Neo Enigma","date":"2014-12-17T19:32:51.701+0000","title":"Runaan´s Hurricane not viable for ADCs/Differrent Playstyle for Carries","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":2,"down_votes":8,"body":"{{item:3085}}  has been an item used by adcs to maximize the damage to more enemies in every AA since it procs passives like those of {{champion:110}} , {{champion:51}} , {{champion:104}} , or {{champion:29}} . It all was perfect until season 5 came out. In this season we see as more assassin are being played and how junglers save their smite to cripple the carrys; and with two smite charges coming up next patch it's going to be harder to keep up. Then, and this is an advice for all adc players out there, I recommend to not get runaan's since you should be focusing in your overall damage to a single target and not their whole team. Still, peeling the enemy team isn't bad at all. So, I recommend building a core of {{item:3006}} , {{item:3031}} , {{item:3035}} , most of the cases {{item:3072}} , and {{item:3087}}  for that peeling starting with {{item:1055}} of course but when you recall rushing {{item:3093}}  for the extra gold and crit. chance and then follow from there. The only decision you need to make is whether to go full crit. chance with {{item:3046}}  OR to get {{item:3153}}  for champs like {{champion:429}}  that do damage based on the enemy health, OR {{item:3142}}  for carries that have a passive or ability(ies) that give an advantage or extra damage over the enemy like {{champion:236}} , {{champion:119}} , and {{champion:133}} ; OR you could even go for a {{item:3078}}  for those with mix damage like {{champion:96}}, or {{champion:42}} . Putting everything together, I think carries should follow the kind of kill one by one playstyle instead of trying to finish the enemy team in one-go, that's is why I think the best adcs this season are {{champion:29}} , and {{champion:67}}  because I, personally, build them as assassin taking out the BT and getting both {{item:3142}} , and {{item:3153}}  for the insane burst. Thank you for reading my thoughts.","replies":[{"poster":"Finkypop","date":"2014-12-17T19:51:02.778+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Runaans Jinx is ridiculous.

Most ADCs have attack speed steroids and the ones that don't have really strong AD ratios or a niche that 50% of the time doesn't synergize with {{item:3085}} . To sum it up, {{item:3085}} is an item you don't usually get anywhere near first since it only provides attack speed.\n\nHOWEVER, it is still good and provides a lot of synergy to select champs.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Neo Enigma","date":"2014-12-17T22:29:43.039+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"i get your point but I still think that with {{item:3087}}  you don't need {{item:3085}}","replies":[{"poster":"maikokk","date":"2014-12-18T14:17:57.015+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"actually{{item:3085}}  makes {{item:3087}}  exponentially more powerful","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Poorly Dressed","date":"2014-12-17T20:53:19.531+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Runaans Caitlyn first item on ARAM. free win ;)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hayaishi","date":"2014-12-17T19:40:48.449+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":5,"body":"It has never been viable on AD carries.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Stacona","date":"2014-12-17T20:43:54.360+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Hurricane is really powerful for jinx because the AoE applies on-hit so when multiple targets are by each other you deal a sht ton of damage --- twitch, kalista use it pretty well because of their Es applying their passives to everyone then nuking them--- varus and kog'maw can use it if you want the AoE--- kayle REALLY loves hurricane for multiple reasons--- Graves and hurricane is really good because his E's cooldown goes down by on-hit","replies":[]},{"poster":"maikokk","date":"2014-12-17T19:41:08.274+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":2,"body":"most adcs get runaans for pushing power and extra sustain.  the team fight extra damage helps but its usually not the reason the item is purcased","replies":[]}]}
