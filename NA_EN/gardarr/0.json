It has gotten so bad that sometimes I don't even want to play league because of this problem.  While in a normal game with no problems I will average 50-60 ms (not great but that is most likely because I am on wifi and there is no Ethernet port near me).  I tested my connection and I am getting around 37.4 mbps download.  Here is an image of the speed test: https://gyazo.com/61b0a0052eef84495ea45fbd20bfcb2a     I don't even live in California...  I know someone will answer with \"Restart your router\" or something like that, but the problem is that I have the Cox Gigablast whatever thing and if I wanna restart it I will have to call them up and who even knows if I can get them to. So if anyone has some tips on how to fix this it will gladly be appreciated!\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\ndarkgamer404","replies":[{"poster":"Chimewlan","date":"2016-08-01T17:14:05.244+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't know.

Now it's 200 plus, after the internet provider change (Now i have At&T Uverse) over a year ago i never once had this issue until now. And as i asked in chat in a match i did just recently, the one guy who responded to my question about riots server going to \"Profanity not included\" said he was having the same issue. Honestly, if the server is having serious issues please fix it. It's not fun trying to play with that amount of ms.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-01T20:32:36.184+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Download and upload speeds look great, but your latency to a server are more influenced by local network configurations or your ISP routing to the server.
