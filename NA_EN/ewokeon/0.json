The Special ward skins are exclusive to the way of the order/ chaos pass. While there is a new border for both of the champ skins, the special chest type (orb of order/ chaos) , Icons, key fragments and champion shards only accessible through the new crafting  for the prices below. there is also an exclusive item for the event called the Daybreak/ Nightfall icon Event emote with only has a limited use so i wouldn't waste 100 Tokens for it \r\n\r\nPrices for new crafting items!\r\n#Orb of Order / chaos = 140 Tokens\r\n#Border = 280 Tokens\r\n#Mystery champ shard = 100 Tokens\r\n#Icon = 80 Tokens\r\n# Keyfrag = 40 tokens\r\n\r\nWhat should you buy?\r\nAfter doing the math the new \"Way of Order/Chaos passes\" is almost worth the price\r\nprovides 1 chest and key (200RP)\r\nOrb of order (essentially a chest so its worth 200RP)\r\nSpecial  ward (exclusive to the chest)  = 640RP\r\n100x Tokens, (1 token = 2.1RP) 1x 100 = 210 RP\r\nIn total costs  = 1250RP while the actual price = 1300RP. For what i recommend is if you want the exclusive items from this package (EG the ward and the tokens_ then i would recommend. but if you're not interested in the ward or the tokens then i would not suggest as the primary cost for this bundle is the ward. so if yo dont like it. don't buy the package","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-06-15T20:10:58.490+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I appreciate your overview, but holy shit caps.

And just going off the text, it would seem only 1 mission from each pass requires you to literally play that champion. \n\nSo is that true? Or is it just bad wording and ALL missions in the passes require you to play as it's respective champion?\n\nI ask because I really would like the wards, but I do not play either Yasuo or Riven. So I feel that if I'm unable to complete the missions then why bother with the pass? :(","replies":[]}]}
