WE give them free drinks while they wait, then by the time they get to a table they pass out drunk from all the freebies before they can even order food, and boy do they order food. \n\nIf you are on the fryer you will do ALL of the Fish and Chips!!!!! ALL of them, Rockfish? Halibut? Salmon? Fatties don't discriminate when it comes to their transfatty fried fish. If we served Sauteed Raccoons assholes on a stick, they would order them and eat them like they do the fried cheese curds. Ordering Pastas and Steamer clams pound after pound. Then you got the dumbfucks ordering the really stupid shit.\n\n* \"2 clam chowder bowls, Shellfish allergy\" \n\n* \"PB &amp; J, add honey, _**No bread**_\" &lt;--------cross eyed little nitwit at table 125 with the sibling parents that I described in short shorts above\n\n* \"Gluten free fried buffalo chicken sandwich\" &lt;-----while they chug glass after glass of GLUTEN FUCKING FILLED LAGER!!!!\n\n* \"Pepper Sauteed sirloin with couscous, vegetarian\"\n\n* \"Pan Fried Oyster Jalapeno with Goat Cheese, SUPER well done, but not rubbery\"\n\n* \"Cheese burger, extra crispy\" &lt;------WTF IS THIS EVEN?!?!?!!\n\n* \"1 Half of a Salmon Burger\" &lt;------**AGAIN, WTF IS THIS?!?!?!?\n\nBut my all time favorite as of today\n\n* Cioppino Pasta Special, Sub Fettuccine, Allergy to penne\"\n\n BECAUSE APPARENTLY THIS DUMBFUCK GOT SUCH PISS POOR GENETICS FROM HIS UNCLE COUSIN DADDY THAT HE IS ALLERGIC TO FUCKING SHAPES!!!!!!!!!\n\nLet me tell you something GD I love cooking, NO SERIOUSLY, I LOVE COOKING, and I am DAMN good at what I do, but Cooking in the summer VS any other time of the year is just hell. I dread going to work this time of year, especially on weekends. And Really it wouldn't be so bad if people were just a little educated on what it truly takes for your food to get to your table, it's not your fault or nothing, Many never even realise what you do, you think a small little modification here and there doesn't rally do nothing, I get it. You think if you order something simple like a cold deli sandwich or a small ceasar salad will come to your table faster.\n\nI cook delicious meal after meal for families and guest enjoying their fridays and weekends with their friends, laughing about work, spoiling the kids relaxing with a special drink while the server is all smiles happy to serve you and make sure you enjoy your stay.\n\nMe? Sometimes im lucky to crouch below your view and sneak some smoked salmon, or a burned piece of chicken that I couldn't serve you into my mouth before i get back to the tickets piling up. A Lot of people think we eat good but the reality is we sometimes skip our free shift meal because the last thing we want to do is cook any more food, we just want to clean the kitchen and go home. I get it's a job, I get paid well, YOU pay me well, even tips, benefits, it's definitely a good job, and I love the art.\n\nIt's just sometimes I feel like it's thankless, You get that one super picky entitled \"suzan\" whining about a slightly underdone ribeye on yep ()that we would have easily compt and replaced) and it can just take all the thank yous and compliments away because really the ones that complain tend to be a lot louder and more willing to act out. I fucking hate YELP, It is such a useful tool for us to be better and serve you and find our faults but few abuse it to lash out and attack us over stuff thats petty, they make it personal using your name, describing you, wanting some sort of revenge like I purposely wet out to hurt you, we will bend over backwards to give free drinks even comp the meal entirely witch can be a bigger loss than you think, I'm human, I am sorry I messed up your sturgeon, but I already made 70+ of that dish today and you were the first and only to complain. It was a fair complaint I won't lie, I just get tired like anyone else.\n\nI'm just a regular joe trying to use what I am good at to make money so I can pay my bills, and keep my puppers fed.","replies":[]}
