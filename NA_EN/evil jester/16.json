I get your point about the OP picks but really, the same thing happens in the normal game mode and in competitive play. Plus you have access to those same OP picks as the other team. yes you are right, ARURF does alleviate the OP picks situation, but at the cost of taking away a players choice and opting for an RNG system that may or may not screw you before the game begins, and a lot of players would rather take a fighting chance picking an OP pick against another than winning or losing at champion select. It's a personal preference issue. why no just have both mods and let everyone be happy?","replies":[{"poster":"RainbowIcee","date":"2017-03-05T15:19:34.341+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Normal game mode is vastly different. You stand a far greater chance of fighting back in a normal game than one in urf were you're just forced to sit back and wait till it's over. And player choice is the whole problem, because player choice is was oppresses the opponents. Though you're right in sitting back and ignoring urf when it does happen i will always opt for All Random urf if it comes down to choosing 1 over the other.
