After this thread has been posted there were many in support of Reworks and changes for our older champions that at the time we felt were becoming less relevant to the game as more new champions entered with new flashy skills, and sick plays, as well as newer abilities. Riot not only responded to it, but spent that last year (or more) making heavy changes and reworks for our old champions based on feedback to be more relevant with the kits of the newer released champions. All I can say is......\n\nhttp://1.bp.blogspot.com/-a_UIAq2QSMc/VXBhEIpUc5I/AAAAAAAAB9E/0_jSFKJsDSM/s1600/thank-you.png\n\nThough some changes were better than others and I'm sure a lot of us have at least one change we weren't necessarily fond of, but the amount of time and effort put into this project I think is more than deserving of some well earned praise. League has come a long way in development and these updates have brought some welcomed changes to the game and our champions.\n\nTo the people who gave feedback and upvotes, thank you for the overwhelming support.

Something like:\n\n-Optimistic: assumes minimal delays, smooth mechanic updates and balancing. (Example: 3 months)\n-Realistic: assumes relatively standard delays, mechanic tweaking, and balancing (Example: 6 months)\n-Pessimistic: assumes full murphy's law, massive delays, scrapped ideas, and re-prioritizing, but still gets released (Example: Year and a half)\n-Not Yet In Progress: Update not yet started, optimistic guess as to when work might begin\n\nObviously based on past experiences and tons of \"No Promises\".

IMO new champs are part of the lifeblood of what keeps League fresh and evolving. \n> \n> 2015 is gonna be a good one.\n\nIf you add several new champs. every year and League continues to be around many years to come, wouldn't the game become a mess that is simply impossible to balance? It seems inevitable that at some point you have to stop adding new champions or risk the quality of the game going down the drain. This is even more true now when champion kits are more niche and complex (thus certain items and changes can disproportionately affect a single champion).\n\nLook at SC2 pre-release and post. Dozens of units were removed or only allowed in single-player because they either provided little unique in terms of gameplay or made balancing too difficult. Sometimes, like the Apple saying goes, \"less is more\". You can consider the longevity of SC1 as a great example of this. The game was still adored and incredibly popular even a decade after its release. People generally want a more tightly-nit experience where every champion has interesting interactions, build paths and a role to fill. Adding new content. should come once that's done. No champion should be relegated to the \"useless\" category for years while new champions are being released. That's akin to buying a new sofa while your roof has a massive leak.\n\nAt some point, even the players themselves would be overwhelmed by the champion roster (not a problem now because 1/4 are barely viable or played). It would be much harder for new players to get into LoL without endless \"wtf\" moments since they don't understand the hundreds of different champion kits.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Scruffy","date":"2015-01-08T00:43:13.249+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":5,"body":"It's definitely true that there is a point (just for illustration say 500 champions) where there are more champions than there should be and it starts to detract rather than add value to the game. \n\nAt our current rate of ~8 new champs a year, I think we have at least a few more years before we start to hit the point of slowing down further. \n\nOn point though, we definitely want to ramp up the rate of fixing/improving existing champs by a large amount.","replies":[{"poster":"Tik115","date":"2015-01-08T01:53:27.522+0000","up_votes":27,"down_votes":6,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RiotScruffy,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ik9r8Es2,comment-id=0037000a0000,timestamp=2015-01-08T00:43:13.249+0000)\n\n> At our current rate of ~8 new champs a year, I think we have at least a few more years before we start to hit the point of slowing down further. \n\nDon't take this the wrong way but personally you should be slowing down NOW, why? well name a champion that came out that HASN'T had problems in terms of ether bugs or balance\n\n{{champion:421}} - Gets a massive spike with the Hydra  to the point of outdueling pretty much everyone and lets not forget submarine Rek'Sai just making it stupid, funnly enough untill we get to the actually balanced one this one is the most balanced, props to Beat Punchbeef for that\n{{champion:429}}  - Unfun to face due to passive, is pretty much a Premade bot only champion\n{{champion:268}}  - Released buggy and is STILL buggy 4 months down the line (albiet not as bad but still)\n{{champion:150}}  - Has officially killed Melee top laners\n{{champion:201}}  - Released being able to solo ADCs even if their fed and he goes full tank,  has had nothing but nerfs since his release 7 months back\n{{champion:161}}  - THIS GUY!

I know it can be frustrating to see a kit or idea set and think \"Great! It's almost done now, all they need to do is code it into the game, tweak a few a numbers and done!\" but realistically that phase of the design is only 5%, maybe 10% of the total work at most.\n\nAs for admitting that some champs need higher priority than others? Nobody is going to disagree with you there, and while there is some universal level of agreement (ex - Yorick would benefit more from an update than Udyr) this is not only very subjective but also can vary widely by discipline. \n\nIf you ask Iron Stylus on the art team who is most desperate need of an update you'll get a very different response  from a member of the design team, or the creative team.

Internship slots can be brutally competitive (iirc - we have less than a 1% acceptance in design due to the volume of applicants) As for gaining experience knowing how to get started on a self driven project can be tricky and extremely daunting which I can definitely empathize with. My advice on that front would not be to dive headfirst into a mod or project, but to start by pushing your boundaries. If you're unfamiliar with coding/programming that can be a great place to work (tons of learning tools online and it's highly transferable). \n\nIf the mod scene is more your jam, start simple and always try to finish what you set out to do, regardless of how small the change or mod is. As you become more comfortable with the toolsets and your abilities continually push yourself just a little bit further each time. There are also some easier to use programs like RPG maker that have good tutorials and can be less daunting than jumping into a complicated mod for a game with less support. \n\nOther avenues to pick up skills can be being a DM/GM in a roleplaying game like Dungeons and Dragons - experienced and awesome DMs learn a lot of useful skills like improvisation, gaming mentalities, encounter and level design etc. Board or Card game design can be an easier avenue to learn how to prototype, iterate, and improve designs. Getting experience as a playtester for board or card games can also be an avenue into both the mindset of a designer but can also lead to opportunities. One of my friends was a board game playtester before getting a job as a designer in the same company. \n\nUnrelated to game design specifically, but picking up new skillsets and knowledge unrelated to design can also be helpful. Learning how to learn, as dumb as that sounds, is incredibly valuable as in design you're constantly entering unknown territory and need to pick up skills on the fly. Learn how to do auto-motive repair, cook, research or craft. The more you can self learn and  pick up unfamiliar skill sets the easier it becomes. \n\nI'm sorry it didn't work out this time for you Thryale, hopefully this was of some help to you and I wish you the best of luck in pursuing your design career. \n\n-Feral","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Cuix","date":"2015-01-07T23:06:27.905+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"> That said, we don't have any plans to slow down new champion releases.
