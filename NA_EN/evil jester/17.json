Also DO NOT forget you can increase the pizazz of the post by using your caps lock button. Some are even ballzy enough to do it throughout the entire post.\n\n* Never blame yourself! \n\nAlways toss the blame at the noobs and feeders in your matches. Remember your are a Silver 5 pro, is always the fault of those below your rank. Never let anyone tell you otherwise.\n\n* Post Dem Chat Logs. \n\nDon&#039;t worry about your profanities and telling that feeder to &quot;get cancer&quot; or &quot;brutality take there own lives&quot;, the Boards will only understand your frustration against the feeder that wen 1/2/6. How could they not, Don't forget the mute button only exists so you can rant without worry if you offend someone right? Remember your Silver 5, and the scores only justify your anger. Also, An elaborate story with no evidence what so ever will also substitute if lacking logs.\n\n* Blah Blah Blah, something about terrible Rito and there failure of the automated report system/ Honor system is flawed, ect. \n\nSeriously you&#039;re not even trying if you don&#039;t include this.\n\n* Don't forget to highly exaggerate how long you have played the game, AS WELL as all the $$$$$ you have spent.\n\nIt makes no sense for Riot to get rid of a paying customer. Bonus points if you threaten to chargeback your credit cards and make a big fuss over how it is your money still. Tell them you spent about 15+ years playing this game. That should do the trick to convince people that you are a super nice guy deserving to be in at least plat 2.\n\n* PROFIT!!! \n\nFarm Those Downvotes, You&#039;ve Earned it buddy.","replies":[]}
