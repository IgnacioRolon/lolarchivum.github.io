Burst is weak against beefier champs due to high damage abilities on long cooldowns, and I think - judging by the board&#039;s cries over the {{item:3116}} nerf - everyone is aware that AP is more costly and less efficient over the long term than AD. So, without squishies to prey on, assassins would only be able to feed off other assassins, which would nullify their place in the game. Champs like {{champion:90}} would barely tickle heavy champs with any notable amount of MR. So the only burst champions that will be relevant are hyper mobile APCs - basically, {{champion:103}} every game. Good luck, assassin players. By deleting ADCs, Riot might as well delete you too.\r\n\r\nTank/bruiser battles will come down to who can outsustain. CC will be king, because the battles will come down to getting your high sustain champions to 1v1 or even 1v2 the enemy&#039;s more damage oriented champs. So if you aren&#039;t annoyed by {{champion:48}} already, you will be.\r\n\r\nBut you still need some DPS and someone capable of outright murdering tanks. Someone with movement speed, attack speed, and armor pen. Or maybe... TRUE DAMAGE. {{champion:157}} {{champion:114}} That&#039;s right, here&#039;s the irony: If you weren&#039;t already tired of {{champion:157}}, expect to see him even more _in spite_ of any upcoming nerfs.\r\n\r\nHere&#039;s what a typical matchup would probably look like in an era with no marksmen.\r\n{{champion:75}} {{champion:39}} {{champion:103}} {{champion:36}} {{champion:114}}\r\n{{champion:122}} {{champion:48}} {{champion:245}} {{champion:54}} {{champion:157}} \r\n\r\nCan&#039;t wait to see one of these teamfights, can you?

Anyone can carry. I've seen Rammus carry.\n\nThe ecosystem of LoL is tank > mage/assassin > marksman > tank. By removing the marksmen, you are removing the tank's predator, which will in turn overpopulate tanks because burst does not threaten them except maybe in the early game.
