All I had up was League and Spotify.\r\n\r\nWindows crashes in champ select. I hastily try to end all tasks, log out of my computer account, log back in, log back into League, and then try to reconnect to the game.\r\n\r\nI guess they called for a remake before I could do that. So yeah. GREAT START TO RANKED.\r\n\r\nSad thing is this is not the first time. I CANNOT DO ANYTHING involving multimedia of any other kind when the League client is up. League friend links me to a Youtube video? Forget about it. Spotify? Apparently after only 30 minutes it hangs, sputters, and if I don't ctrl alt del fast enough, _crash_. I don't even bother clicking on the notifications about LCS games because guess what? I get 5 minutes in and stream hangs, same thing.\r\n\r\nThe best part is my computer is not even a year old and can run League on the highest graphics settings, plus it has a 6th gen i7 processor.\r\n\r\nWhat is wrong with your client? I can play the _game_ itself without any hitches. It's when the client is just open, idling. OR WHEN I'M IN CHAMP SELECT.\r\n\r\nThis is ridiculous and I don't care to have to close League every time I want to watch a Youtube clip. I also want my MMR/LP back.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-05T17:04:03.119+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd like to help with this but I need some more information.  Specifically, can you explain what you are seeing when you say you've crashed?  Are you receiving any errors and what does it say?  For some more context, run a[ log reader](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743-Connection-Troubleshooting-Log-Reader) on the matches where you're having this issue, and let me know the results.

I've looked at Task Manager while the League client is up and I have to say it does take quite a lot of memory compared to what I'd expect. To have it drop down to almost nothing as the log indicates, however, is very strange.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-05T23:02:08.361+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for following up on this.  A great first step here would be to strengthen your connection and resolve any issues that your network is having staying connected to the server.  When you have some time, go over our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to get this fixed up.  Once complete, test out a few custom game modes to prevent penalties, and let me know if you have any issues.","replies":[{"poster":"Hauling Ashe","date":"2016-08-06T02:32:05.401+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That would explain an Internet connection failure but I know that's not the problem. The problem is my computer hangs and loses that connection due to everything short of the OS itself crashing.\n\nFor example, in champ select during that instance, the sound started cutting out and then made a noise that sounded like it was physically tearing my sound card apart. The animations all got choppy until they just stopped altogether. Even the final timer before game start stopped counting down. The client and Spotify both froze and I had to shut all tasks down just to close both programs.","replies":[{"poster":"Hauling Ashe","date":"2016-08-06T09:22:49.704+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just a couple minutes ago the League client just completely shut down and closed itself. (Although I looked at what tasks were running and the client patcher as well as the pvp.net kernel were still going.)\n\nAll I was doing was watching a video with the client idling on the home page. The video started chopping up as videos do whenever I have the client running. So I stopped the video and went back to the client. Clicked on the crafting button. League shuts down without even an alert message to tell me anything had failed. No log file to be found from that instance.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
