I am not really an expert in that field so I wanted to ask you guys if someone could possibly answer. The laptops I'm looking have these specifications:\r\n- processor Intel core i3 7020u (laptop 1), AMD Ryzen 3 (laptop 2)\r\n- ram 4gb (laptop 1), 8gb ddr4 (laptop 2)\r\n- graphics Intel hd 620 (laptop 1), Radeon Vega 3 1.1Mhz (laptop 2)\r\nWould they be able to run league normally and which one would be better. Laptop 2 is a bit more expensive (like $50) but I wanna know is it really worth it to buy laptop 2, or is it only a bit better than laptop 1?","replies":[]}
