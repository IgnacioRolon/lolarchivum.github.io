If he needs to be adjusted for it, fine, but gameplay shouldnt really revolve around \"are they low enough?\". A darius thats played 10 games on him in a row isnt going to missjudge his ult, so its not really an up in the air question.","replies":[{"poster":"BlackKnightJack","date":"2019-08-16T17:52:09.213+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well a person who's played 10 games on Garen isn't going to misjudge HIS ult now is he?","replies":[{"poster":"Pika Fox","date":"2019-08-16T18:39:26.369+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=BlackKnightJack,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=uRENep1H,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2019-08-16T17:52:09.213+0000)\n>\n> Well a person who's played 10 games on Garen isn't going to misjudge HIS ult now is he?\n\nI mean, theres no penalty for him if he does or not. Its just commonly used to execute.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Pika Fox","date":"2019-08-16T17:32:52.979+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreed, plus they already have the villain indicators setup for it as well.","replies":[]}]}
