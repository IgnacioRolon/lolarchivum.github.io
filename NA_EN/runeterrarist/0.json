I do not feel it was justified, after reviewing my logs i found no hostile behavior, as i had just gotten off of my ten game ban and was trying VERY hard to simply mute toxic players. That is not my complaint. It does not seem to be counting down. I receive a NEW chat ban message every time i finish a game or log on, always at 25. Your system has failed me. I risk losing my account which i have spent a great deal of money on. This is terrible. This is the only game i play. I am trying very hard to play well and watch my language and trolls can simply have me banned now by reporting me for not giving up my lane or asking them why they are intentionally feeding? I have severe anger problems, i have a hard enough time controlling my language in real life and now i have to take virtual penalties as well even when i am behaving well. On top of that now it seems I am permanently banned from chatting at all. This is unacceptable. Players constantly and deliberately feed kills and when you ban them they simply come back to ranked with a new number at the back of their name. I am sorry for my temper, lack of restraint and poor language. I have indulged in rants against toxic players, sinking myself to their level and dishonoring my name. Your system is now threatening to ban me just when i had begun to redeem myself. This insane unlimited chat ban is unfair and undeserved.","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-11-08T07:47:33.603+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This goes in the player behavior forums, not gamplay.\n\nWe can't determine whether or not your punishment was deserved unless you post the chat logs. That is not your primary concern so if you don't want to talk about that it is fine, but I think it would help you if you posted them and we helped identify what specifically got you punished.\n\nAs for the number of restricted games not going down after matches, it is probably a glitch causing it to send you the wrong message. I would suggest closing the client and logging back into it, and if that doesn't work then submit a support ticket asking about it.","replies":[]}]}
