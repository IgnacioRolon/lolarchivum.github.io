I&#039;m losing promotionals, then i get grouped up with the most psychotic hateful trolls ever over and over because of my low priority que. I&#039;ve filed bug reports and nothing is being done. I cant email anyone, I&#039;m going to be losing hundreds of dollars worth of skins if this keeps up and i couldn&#039;t be more disappointed.
