If she's sitting in a nest of 3-4 tentacles and she has her E up then your priority needs to baiting her E to whiff. If she hits it do not engage, you'll die or lose so much HP that you can't fight her pushing. Instead you should use your time either getting away to minimize your damage or killing the tentacles if she focuses your soul. You want to take any opportunity to kill tentacles so you can minimize her damage. \n\nWhen she whiffs E you need to go in ASAP before she has it up again. After that, gauge if you can kill her if she ults (if she has it.) also. Move clockwise or CCW during her ultimate. It helps you dodge tentacle damage better since you want to move perpendicular to where you are to avoid damage. This gets easier to do the more MS you have. \n\nHer 2 big cooldowns are E and R. Always be conscious of those.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Posui Gart","date":"2019-09-01T09:44:08.401+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She is like a WoW boss\nDodge her tentacles. \nDon't stack for her R, or if you did-run away\nTry to bait her E, if you didn't and she caught your soul-run away\nIt doesn't matter if you have number or item advantage, just DON'T IGNORE HER SPELLS.
