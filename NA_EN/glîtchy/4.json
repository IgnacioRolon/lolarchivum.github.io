Something along the lines of (and I'm paraphrasing because there is no way, as far as I know, to see a notification of post removal similar to how one no longer gets an email of their chat restriction or ban 'card') \"We aren't gonna take action at this time but let this be a warning to you\". \n\nSo I will describe, maybe you will recall. It was two screen shots, one of a 1:34:35 game and the other being 4:20:03 with a wukong, nasus, trist and vlad colluding. The 4 hour 20 minute game, vlad/nasus were on blue, trist/wukong on red. Trist had 2,310 CS (all 4 had over 1k CS) Wukong had 103 kills. On the hour and a half game, wukong/vlad blue, trist/nasus red. Same accounts. I followed them on op.gg for weeks because I was perma'd over it... Go figure. Interesting how my post had information regarding less than truthful statements being made to me by a double digit number of support agents.... BUT ANWAY...\n\nThe behavior you said IS punished was NOT punished. So did you mean to say punishable? Or.... Because I somehow was punished that qualifies as the behavior being punished? Or SOMETIMES that behavior is actually punished? I'm quite confused and I won't make the claim but it SEEMS that something less than 100% genuine honesty and transparency is happening, perhaps to suppress information, perhaps not. I removed all names, even my own so no one could go through almost a year of my match history (at this point in time) and look for games that I played X champ and had the champs in the screenshot as well and determining the summoner names. \n\nYes, there is more written here than the average post so I will make it clear what I am trying to figure out. Four friends, each in a duo snipe games so that it is impossible to get a surrender vote and impossible to win or lose by other measures due to them feeding kills back and forth thereby making them have, for example, 43k gold to one of the players not in the group's 18k gold? Are you claiming that those players actually were punished? Or at least that they should have been? In answering, you can take the possibility of it going undetected out of the equation because I spent almost 4 months making my case until an agent (specifically an amazing agent with a name that involved the color blue, a different word for vulpine, and a 5 letter name that begins with 'B') actually reviewed the game after 4 months, 10 or 11 previous agents assigned the ticket, and roughly 80 e-mails just from me and then logically a close to, if not identical number of e-mails from all the other support agents combined. So support absolutely knew about what they did and I say that with 100% certainty. I was, in fact, advised to just leave just as I did in the 4 hour 20 minute game. Yet no punishment unless they received chat restrictions because as I stated before, I followed all four on op.gg for a couple months while in the process of getting my account permaban lifted. They all changed their names about 10 weeks after the two incidents. \n\nI understand if this is beyond your scope and/or realm of authority to answer on. If that is the case, letting me know would be greatly appreciated. I just want an honest answer and I have been very patient and, in my opinion, very VERY respectful by not making posts across independent (that is to say where Riot has no authority) sites outlining each and every time Riot has either blatantly lied to me, violated their own terms in regards to how individuals are to treat each other, or have been... hmmm... selective about who they punish, all of which I have undeniable proof of, mainly in the form of e-mail correspondence. \n\nOne might think \"gee whiz buddy, this happened in jan 2018 and you haven't dropped it?\". To which I would respond that it's irrelevant how long ago it happened and the fact that every time I drop even one bit of dirt I have my posts get removed would suggest that Riot still cares as well. \n\nThank you for your time. I have one more request. If you are unable to shed any light on any of the issues I brought up, what might be a good place to do so outside of sending in a ticket that no one but Riot employees will see and obviously do nothing about it (which if it's not obvious why I feel that would be pointless, it's not like THEY would come out publicly and address it) that would be more, let's say \"sportsmanlike\", than summarizing everything and providing pastebins AND screenshots of every single email? If no such place exists, is there anything you would recommend that wouldn't involve damaging the reputation of not only Riot but several employees as well? Because I simply am not that person but damnit it's been nearly a year and I've yet to even get an apology and I am still being silenced. Thanks again.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Glîtchy","date":"2018-12-28T20:54:41.435+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=rujitra,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=Byip2sgR,comment-id=000000000001000200010000000000020000,timestamp=2018-12-28T16:02:20.527+0000)\n>\n> That type of behavior actually is punished.\n> \n> Simply refusing to surrender a game, but not intentionally preventing your team or the enemy from ending, is not.\n\nUh you seem to ignore the fact they INTENTIONALLY gave kills to all lanes and were stealing camps, how is that not trolling?

Initiating a surrender vote can have the opposite effect, waking your team up to the dire situation before them and make them realize that if they don't stop messing around, they could lose this game. Agreeing to the surrender vote however would indeed increase your chance of losing, and rather immediately I might add, but there are definitely other actions you can take to make it easier to lose. You're oversimplifying the way the surrender vote works and I honestly think that's pretty silly and I don't know why you are but you should take a step back and look at a bigger picture here.\n\nYou might have a point in implying he might have not been playing at his best because if he muted spammers he might have been able to focus a bit more on what truly mattered, but that's a matter of debate so I won't call you right or wrong by implying that.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lavitztyr","date":"2018-12-28T09:01:44.363+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bottom line; play the game with the intent to win/have fun then report as needed when the game is over.

Try to win despite their insanity, which given enough time, sometimes snaps them out of their chaotic mindset or you just wasted time and effort with that attempt and the alternative would be to temporarily accept that you're not playing the same game you signed up for and just do whatever while still participating as a team member.\n\nUnfortunately, because we can't see who is in which groups, some people might jump to the wrong conclusion and might not even try to draw out chat evidence of groups they are matched with or perhaps more accurately they might get upset at being matched AGAINST good teamwork or groups which betrays a lack of sportsmanship. Either way, although in my mind I can't disagree that we see too much 'do whatever' play styles...I have to wonder if this would happen less/more often if RIot showed us the groups so that we don't jump to conclusions and make decisions about how to play the game that we might regret later.\n\nI feel like if for no other reason, Riot should let us know who is in which groups so that it would be easier to be diplomatic towards them and it would be easier to accept diplomatic responses from those groups. It takes a different kind of strategy to talk to a different number of players because many groups simply won't allow us to talk to individuals. If we tell one player something, and they have friends playing with them on the team too, that message affects them personally and they will respond, whether in chat or not,  positively or negatively. \n\nSometimes this matters when it comes to timing. It can be difficult to cooperate with a lane partner for example who is in a group because they might start talking to their friend before typing anything to me and then their friend starts flaming me for something that's none of their business. Whether I'm to blame or my lane partner is or neither of us is to blame, if I'd known they were part of a group before the game started and during the game, I'd actually think that maybe I should more quickly make my own report(tell the team what went wrong in our lane) so that they don't just let their rage fester and burst out in such a way that I will have to mute them both.","replies":[]}]}]}
