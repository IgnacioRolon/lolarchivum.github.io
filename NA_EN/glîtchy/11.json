Inhib towers can be lost as early as 10-15 mins leaving your nexus towers open. \"At that stage of the game\", I still don't have 2 full items. If this was 3 seasons ago when t1 towers dropped at that same time, then I'd agree with you. But incase you forgot how strong nexus towers were, look: \n\n* Health regeneration reduced to 5 from 15.\n* Attacks now utilize a laser beam instead of a projectile.\n* Attack speed increased to 4 from 0.83 - i.e. 4 instances of damage per second.\n* Now gain 82.5% armor penetration.\n* Now applies a debuff to its attack target: This unit deals 15% reduced damage and has 10% reduced movement speed.\n* With every hit, the turret will generate 6 Heat (up to 120). The turret will deal 0.0105% bonus damage for every Heat (0.063% for 6 Heat). When a turret switches targets it will lose all current Heat.","replies":[{"poster":"3TWarrior","date":"2018-08-25T03:45:44.160+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wanted to comment on this very thing but I do not remember well enough as their use was very brief\n\nI was basically going to say \"wait, last I remember, riot said they were doing their job too well and deterring players from entering the range of the turret until late game, thereby almost forcing turtle games\"","replies":[{"poster":"Anin777","date":"2018-08-26T07:55:40.965+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=3TWarrior,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=I0jVn9Up,comment-id=000200000000000000020000,timestamp=2018-08-25T03:45:44.160+0000)\n>\n> I wanted to comment on this very thing but I do not remember well enough as their use was very brief\n> \n> I was basically going to say &quot;wait, last I remember, riot said they were doing their job too well and deterring players from entering the range of the turret until late game, thereby almost forcing turtle games&quot;\n\nThat's one way to look at it but that was okay.

A single super minion also shouldn't be able to take out both your towers. While being shot at by both. At least when champs blow them up in 3 seconds its because its endgame. Minions shouldn't be able to casually take your towers in a single wave by themselves.\n\nI'd personally say make nexus turrets like they are in twisted treeline. 2.5 AS.

Giving you 5+ minutes more under it while you're losing isn't going to give you back your lane and if you're ahead, you're never going to invest in such a mechanic anyway.

This ability avoid champions damage the towers without having enemy creeps closed to the turret. No necesary to have siege or super minions in the wave.\nAnd a bit more attack speed, because with the problem having only an 0.83 of attack speed, is that they take a long time to retarget an enemy champion who is attacking an allied champion. Whit an attack speed of 1.1, will be enought to solve the problem.\nAnd just only these 3 things, imo nothing more.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jackom1","date":"2018-08-24T09:58:54.640+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:83}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Devaliah","date":"2018-08-24T12:50:55.459+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I was just talking about is making turrets deal increasing % of true damage per shot with a friend. first hit is pure AD, second 15-20%, third 30-40% ETC. so if you were tankier you could still take a hit or 2. but you can't sit under it almost indefinitely like some tanks can do now.
