Yasuo had PD which gives 12% overall damage reduction. Yasuo have has passive shield which makes him quite tanky at the beginning of a fight and considering he had his double crit core + some lifesteal it'd look like you're not damaging him at all which I assume what did happen.\n\nIdk much about Yorick but if you failed to shut down yasuo as a top lane bruiser and let him reach his double crit core + some hp/armor items he'd steamroll you easily unless you play a skirmisher that outscales him.\n\nI don't see the issue here really.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Salron","date":"2017-08-19T20:17:40.778+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Tabis are broken\nMore news at 11","replies":[]}]}
