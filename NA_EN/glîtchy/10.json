If it was changed (the kit), Yi would stop being a one-dimensional champion that every new player loves to use.\nI personally don't see any major problems with yi, at least in this preseason. The only time you hate a Master Yi is if someone fed him, but that applies to every jungler excluding Ivern.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-12-17T00:20:02.190+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yi is garbage.\n\nHe needs a rework, not nerfs.\n\nRemoving the cooldown on it would inarguably make him the worst champ in the game, and probably sink him to about a 40% winrate.","replies":[{"poster":"xDogMeatx","date":"2018-12-17T12:41:36.075+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MagicFlyingLlama,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=p8ii09n5,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-12-17T00:20:02.190+0000)\n>\n> Yi is garbage.\n> \n> He needs a rework, not nerfs.\n> \n> Removing the cooldown on it would inarguably make him the worst champ in the game, and probably sink him to about a 40% winrate.\n\nthats a good thing sometimes to make a cancerous champ dumpster tier i mean they kinda did that to fizz (rework wise its pretty big nerf to me)  why should someone get rewarded 1 billion damage for aaing champs with % true dmg just for % stacking 0 counterplay style it shouldnt require cc to stop a X champ if you dont have a stun or so u auto lose. sure i play yi sometimes for fun but i dont mind if he gets nerfed to oblivion like they did to fizz he makes people toxic due to unfair aas that you cant dodge .","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Jamaree","date":"2018-12-17T00:34:40.905+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Translation of post: \"I lost to Yi, nerf him.\"","replies":[]}]}
