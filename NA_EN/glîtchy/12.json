Yes if I know I'm facing him, I can pick a champ that works on him, but if not then I get smashed. so I stay back, lose tons of farm, and he just gets to the point that he tower dives me, then I'm screwed either way. He can dash all around the lane making skill shots very difficult to hit, oh, but he also has a windwall that blocks any projectile, and hell lets not forget his non-mana, smash your face against the Q as much as u can, instant spams. I feel like I'm forgetting something....oh yeah, his shield....this champs tilts me faster than teemo. \n\nHe is a champ that is stupid easy to be good with, and if you're really good with him, there isn't much you can do against him. he is a bs champ.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-06-14T03:49:49.285+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your team was awful.

I got into ranked way sooner than I should have and really messed up. I'm no superstar and anyone that looks up my record can confirm that.\n\nPoint being that if some bronze three chump like me can figure out how to play against Yas in less than six months from starting then anyone should be able to. Don't get me wrong there's some high level Yas players out there that are tough to beat no matter what but the majority are just so so. I don't even worry about banning him anymore at this point.\n\nThe biggest prob with Yas is everyone assumes he's gonna win. Pick a champ that counters him, dodge his skill shots and be patient. He'll eventually tower dive you and die lol.","replies":[]}]}
