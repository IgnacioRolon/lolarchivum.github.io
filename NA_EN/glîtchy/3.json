And then you're going to try to breakdown how Shaco's stealth is \"moar op\" than the other champs? Let me set this straight for you:\n\nShaco's Q - Deceive lasts 5 seconds at max rank. With max cdr (cooldown reduction), i believe its on a 5 or 6 second cd (cooldown). Its 10 seconds at lvl 1. He can place his W - Jack in the Box and not break invis and potentially fear an entire team for 2 seconds at max rank (.75 second fear at rank 1) and do a little to a lot of damage (the JitB can only target one opponent at a time tho) depending on your build. He can also jump walls with it/dodge skill shots and abilities as it \"flashes\" him towards his cursor, similar to flash, but a lower range.\n\nWukong's W - Decoy is.. oh idk cuz i dont play him much, but on a 8ish sec cd at max rank (with cdr i believe its at 4-6 seconds). The decoy clone and stealth last for 2ish seconds. However, his ultimate can literally knock up an entire team as well as deal significant damage to all who stay in it. So, if played correctly, Wukong's stealth is by far a greater threat. The decoy clone slows, deals a small amount of damage, and can completely confuse an enemy team, causing them to possibly waste entire ultimate abilities/summoner spells on a clone that lasts about 1.5 seconds. WUKONG'S STEALTH IS SHACO'S Q - DECEIVE AND R - HALLUCINATE'S LOVECHILD. ARE YOU EFFIN SERIOUS BRUH.\n\nKha,Zhix's stealth is \"for a brief moment\" over and over again. Kha has stealth from his R - Void Assault, but also is granted passive stealth if he chooses to evolve his R. Anytime he enters new brush, he gains that stealth passive (i believe there is a 9 second cd per brush) as well as his R allows him to go invis, gain dmg reduc (possibly changed, but at one point it did), gain a short burst of movement speed, and resets his passive which grants him a good chunk of dmg from his passive - Unseen Predator. Did i mention that when he stealths in brush, he once again resets his passive? Kha can literally take a path thru the jungle that, if he's evolved his R, he will have constant stealth from each brush while doing massive damage if you're isolated... But... Ya know... Its only for a breif moment...\n\nAkali is not only invisible in just a small radius, but she also does a mini-flash in the direction of your cursor, as well as gains a movement speed boost while in her W - Twilight Shroud that persists for a brief moment after she leaves the shroud. She also has massive burst damage, insane burst potential, great sustain, and is manaless. Shaco relies on blue buff to be able to be a constant threat. Akali just needs to wait 2.5 seconds (guesstimating, for you nitpickers) for her energy to regen. I will grant you, Shaco's stealth is arguably \"better\" than Akali's, but it depends on the situation and what you're using the stealth for. If you're trying to farm, Shaco's stealth is terrible: He breaks stealth once he auto attacks and has to wait for the cd to refresh. Akali is revealed for a brief moment but then restealths after a short moment until the shroud dissipates (something like 5-8 seconds). Thats a pretty handy tool. \n\nTeemo's stealth is almost more useful than Shaco's as Teemo can be invisible INDEFINITELY. Unless you grab a red trinket or a champion with a stealth revealing ablility (*looking* at you Lee Sin... lmfao that never gets old), Teemo can literally stay invis an entire game. THAT'S PRETTY RIDICULOUS. Not only can he stealth, he can move around while stealthed in a bush and gains 40% attack speed (atk spd) after breaking stealth. Not to mention his shrooms can deal massive damage, slow an entire enemy team, and remain 4 times longer than Shaco's JitB. Teemo's stealth is activated by simply staying still for 2ish seconds i believe (twice as fast if he's in brush) and takes no mana to \"cast\". Talk about drawbacks.\n\nVayne Vayne Vayne. I can't even believe you're sitting here trying to tell me that Vayne's stealth is in any way worse than Shaco's. Would you like to know why? I'll tell you: RANGED TRUE DMG BRUH. Okay, you count the amount of games Vayne has been played in pro and I'll count the Shaco games and then we'll take a look and see which champ has carried harder shall we? While on paper Vayne's stealth seems like its at a huge disadvantage, you're forgetting several key components: THE REST OF VAYNE'S KIT AND EFFING RANGED TRUE DMG BRUH. Vayne can dodge/reposition with her Q - Tumble (which also conveniently activates her stealth if her she's casted her ultimate), has RANGED EFFING TRUE DMG with her W - Silver Bolts, has a KNOCKBACK with the possibility to STUN if her enemy collides with terrain on her E - Condemn, as well as passive movement speed when moving towards enemies as well as other passive effects from her ultimate (increased movement speed is the only one i can remember off the top of my head). Let me also put this in perspective. Vayne can 2 shot a carry with no stealth from 500 or so units aka RANGED. Shaco has to either 2 shot with his E - Two-Shiv Poison (if he built straight AP), which would take at least 10 seconds as its on a 4-5 second cd at max rank as well as terrible positioning TWICE from the carry who didnt back after the first time they were nearly nuked, OR, Shaco has to Q - Deceive directly on top of the carry, potentially being focused himself, and not guaranteeing the kill, especially if his R - Deceive is on cd. Did I mention RANGED TRUE DMG????\n\nIN CONCLUSION, NOT only were you completely incorrect in stating that Shaco had the ONLY true stealth ability in the game, you are by and far completely off the mark when addressing how the other characters stealth abilities and mechanics fair against Shaco's. The only change to Shaco's stealth they should make is to reduce the amount of stealth from 5 seconds to 3 or 4. Other than that, Shaco's stealth is completely in line in terms of \"power\", especially when compared with other champs stealth abilities. \n\nSincerely,\n\nCall Me BigPappa a Shaco main and Bard GOD","replies":[{"poster":"Glîtchy","date":"2017-03-24T17:45:39.838+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Call Me BigPappa,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=MksgaYgy,comment-id=000c0000000200000000,timestamp=2017-03-24T16:59:31.910+0000)\n>\n> So you&#x27;re going to ignore the fact that you straight up incorrectly stated that Shaco has the ONLY TRUE STEALTH ABILITY in the game?

I would say that it actually decreased it due to uncounterable 4 seconds stealth, zoning and CC with his R, buffed damage from Q+backstab combo and even more increased utility with W maxed as second.\nEven his statistics say otherwise. Pre rework Shaco had depending on the meta from 47% to 51% win rate, top lane AP Shaco had even less while post rework he had up to 56% as AP and after bugfixes his AD build started to grow in win rate too. Toplane AP Shaco has 53% win rate now. \n\nChanges to W, Q and R made him easier to play (lowered his skill floor) but made him more challenging to master (increased his skill ceiling) as utilizing his R zone and CC in the most efficient fashion while fooling enemies at the same time can be challenging and placing boxes while invisible lets him do more funky stuff. It even goes with Riot's champion design philosophy: easy to play challenging to master.","replies":[{"poster":"Aldapsayar","date":"2017-03-26T16:41:23.203+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"AP Shaco jungle is busted af, I admit. He might not have high skill floor and eveything you said can be said about AP Shaco. But if you look at reddit, majority of mains use AD build, because it is more viable and has more utility in game. And much harder to play. That's why I was talking about AD Shaco. I should have clarified that, mb. \nAD Shaco now attracts only dedicated players. Playing him is harder as he used to have 4 seconds stealth and 2.2 AD ratio from level one. Now he has 1.5, 2.5, 3, 3.75 seconds stealth with levels and crit on his Q with about 1.2 AD scaling. His e is a joke now til you put 3 points on it (which is done after you put 3 points on Q and one point on W and R) which is on roughly level 8. That's means I don't have E as damage source til level 8. W is better, that's easier. R maybe also easier for beginner or casual player, but in general, trust me,  his AD version requires much more brain then before. I even did not know what to do after rework till I found new build from guy named Chinese Jester. Then I played more and more and realized that AD Shaco became like marksmen. He doesn't scale naturally. He can scale only with certain items.\nTank Shaco is actually more then people think. He actually requires good mechanics and his itemization is most expensive. \nPeople think its so easy to create chaos as Shaco now, but they have no idea how much work you put for that now. And I like it. Its very rewarding and teaches me a lot about jungling. Before I could just jump in and kill everybody. Now you gotta plan every step and also be ahead enemy jungler, because before you could outduel any of them (except for Xin and Graves). Seriously, you just could walk into their jungle and kill em. Now you cannot do that. Til you have special items xd. Sorry for too many letters.

He is played rarely since then as AP in the jungle to the point that there is not enough data on various sites. The current problem with Shaco is his bruiser build.\n\nBruiser build is way too forgiving on him and is extremely unhealthy with his long duration of stealth. With Trinity and Titanic he is bursting down squishies better than with Lethality/Crit build path and after he is done with their squishies he can DPS with clone while being hard to kill. There is really not planning or mechanical outplays or macro involved in it, you just roflstomp their team.\nIn order to stabilize win rate on this build (win rate speaking) there must be some power shifts in his kit and change of base stats in favor of scalling (but that is just my opinion).\n\nIs AD Shaco harder now? Yes, and this is because his AD scalings and base damage got nerfed and he must rush Tiamat no matter what making his Lethality stacking slower and his early damage lower. But his stealth and current damage still lets him to apply pressure, taking kills without much thought required.\n\nCurrently AP Shaco seems to be in the most balanced state out of all build paths (not as weak as AD, not as strong as Bruiser): 52% in the Top lane with 0,6% pick rate and also represents Riot's philosophy with tricking stuff.\n\nEDIT: I am a guy who mained this champion since season 4 (played him earlier but it was more like having fun with troll builds). His post rework state makes me despise this champion. I don't find any fun in playing him, there is no more thrill of being completely cucked by your counters, there is no clever playing around pink wards anymore, there is no decision making with \"do I want to max W for utility next or Q for more damage untill IE?\", bad clone usage is less punishing because of zoning potential it brings now, and this stealth duration didn't feel as unfair as it is now.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Glory ln Death","date":"2017-03-24T19:44:55.218+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Some people just want to watch the world burn.","replies":[{"poster":"Glîtchy","date":"2017-03-24T19:49:44.499+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Glory ln Death,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=MksgaYgy,comment-id=0019,timestamp=2017-03-24T19:44:55.218+0000)\n>\n> Some people just want to watch the world burn.\n\nShaco mains be like\n\nhttps://media.tenor.co/images/9e382900d4d30d26bdc1747cb3abf823/raw","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Glîtchy","date":"2017-03-23T23:00:02.495+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Have you seen the thread titled \"What's wrong with Shaco mains?\"\n\nif you have, refer to that.\n\nAlso literally several Shaco's I've seen have said he needs a buff.","replies":[{"poster":"Inari Fox Orrion","date":"2017-03-24T01:07:30.179+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"As a {{champion:35}} main, albeit a Support who has a tendency to get Lv1 dragon, I can say wholeheartedly...\n...that he doesn't need buffs or nerfs.
