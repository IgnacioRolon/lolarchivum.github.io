A lower rank support can duo with a higher rank botlaner (or similarly a low top and higher jungle) and abuse the fact that their team's total MMR will match their opponent's while the first team is only allocating their MMR to carry roles and the latter has a higher rank noncarry which will have a lesser impact on the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Glîtchy","date":"2018-07-21T04:12:47.262+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=PopcornBunni,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=MAVsp6E0,comment-id=00050000,timestamp=2018-07-21T03:15:43.201+0000)\n>\n> And the current elo system is really easy to abuse with duo queuing.
