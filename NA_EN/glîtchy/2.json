So technically, Annie can miss her ulti, and that you can dodge it if you get out of the cast zone in time.\n\nThe problem is that Tibbers has no summoning animation at all, no casting animation whatsoever, and he is just suddenly there. This makes \"Tibbers is an AoE tho\" pretty much pointless.\n\nBut really though, Her kit is atm too clunky at this stage and she is over-reliant on not just her ulti to do anything but also the fact it's missing a spell animation which has to be fixed at some point and neither should it be a point to balance a champ with. Annie as a whole just needs a lot of tidying up to do.

She will build flat pen and deathcap. The best you can hope for is to walk away with 25% health. \n\nit's the same thing with AD assassins though.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Malix Farwin","date":"2019-02-21T09:20:57.483+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Glîtchy,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=VQ95EcMq,comment-id=00030000,timestamp=2019-02-21T08:44:32.638+0000)\n>\n> The bigger issue is that other than maybe maw of malmortius, there’s not really any counterplay\n\nTheres plenty of counterplay. She is designed to be a simple champion and because of that pretty much anyone who plays this game for more then a month knows her entire kit easily. If you are having problems with Annie thats an You problem and they shouldn't balance around that.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ReySolomon","date":"2019-02-21T07:35:33.230+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I rarely see annie now lol.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Warlord Rhinark","date":"2019-02-21T07:33:34.225+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I find great success in taking {{summoner:1}} against Annie.\n\nI know it doesn't reduce the initial damage, but it at least keeps Tibbers from slamming on you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Paroe","date":"2019-02-21T11:22:24.182+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"*cough* CRITICAL STRIKES AND BASIC ATTACKS IN GENERAL *cough*","replies":[]}]}
