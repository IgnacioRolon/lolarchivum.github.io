Otherwise, her mechanical ceiling could be quite high in high elo situation even without abusing the animation cancelling, so that's something.\n\nHer issues seems to be that people are actually glorifying and teaching each other about how to break the game in unintended fashion and think that's a skill. The fact that Riot tried to fix the exploit, and failed, and so they ended up just balancing Riven around it instead now doesn't help either.","replies":[]}]}
