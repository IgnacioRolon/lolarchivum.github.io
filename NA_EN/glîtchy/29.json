Laning against her is easiest part of playing against her. Its her biggest weakness and biggest reason why she is on 45% winrate and why she falls off easily. Pick ANYTHING with semi decent waveclear, dont stand inside minions and shove. She will have to use her W and Q to last hit as she is bad at farming under turret. She wont have mana and CDs to trade with you. You will always be ahead in farm. Pick Exhaust just in case. Her late game is horrible due to everyone having some MR and due to her being so squishy she gets 2 shotted. Her laning phase is horrible due to her shitty laning phase. Only her mid game is somewhat decent unless opponent have hexdrinker/abyssal.\n\nBut i will admit she is kinda ok in Bronze and Silver due to  players there having bad reaction speed and low mechanical skills to deal with her.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"SOLOQSUPERHERO","date":"2016-06-01T17:43:07.438+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Honestly you need to just consider what chamions you play against her more closely.\n\nChampions like Morgana/Lissandra have enough cc and tankiness to lock her down.\n\nI've found Taliyah to be fantastic against her too, she can't w over your E without instantly losing the trade, especially early on.","replies":[{"poster":"Glîtchy","date":"2016-06-01T18:12:38.800+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Morgana, makes things WAY too easy with her 5 year long stun, I don't own Lissandra, and Taliyah's just boring too me, an ult that doesn't damage or raise any of my stats besides movement bores me.","replies":[{"poster":"SOLOQSUPERHERO","date":"2016-06-01T20:37:36.382+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well who are you playing?","replies":[{"poster":"Glîtchy","date":"2016-06-02T00:27:09.133+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ahri, Veigar and Fizz.\n\nI'm only playing Veigar and Fizz to get myself outta bronze","replies":[{"poster":"SOLOQSUPERHERO","date":"2016-06-02T13:08:45.530+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Haven't played the Ahri match up since they made charm no longer stop her dash so she probably will lose it now, not sure.\n\nVeigar is a toss up. If you can make it out of lane without her getting a kill you're fine, but that's alot easier said then done.\n\nFizz it's basically dog eat dog, she can kill you you can kill her. I don't personally like these match ups as it becomes a snowball battle.\n\nLissandra is solid champ in general, I think would be good for your pool. Rush abyssal scepter, play safe til six and you have negatron and you'll be able to beat her. Take ignite, not tp.\n\nKorea uses lux as a counter to LB and it can work if you know what you're doing. Another solid and more forgiving choice could be karma. She can bully LB early. What's nice about karma also, especially if you have a damage top lane or jungle and a squishy support, you can go athenes first for a solid amount of cheap stats and get ahead pretty quick.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"M15TAH JAY","date":"2016-06-02T01:17:17.033+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"so she needs a nerf purely because people don't know how to move tf out of the way? really? ok just gut every champion THAT YOU CAN'T LANE AGAINST and turn it into league of catering to crybabies","replies":[]},{"poster":"PentaJuke","date":"2016-06-01T18:33:33.408+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Meh shes completely fine, complain about zed plz.","replies":[{"poster":"Glîtchy","date":"2016-06-01T18:38:17.948+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"Okay, Zed's ult is absolute bullshit that is no longer effected by QSS. there.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"zlumpy","date":"2016-06-04T02:09:13.207+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I noticed something on the faerie queen or w/e the skin name is called.

She's meant to oneshot people early on. Look at some LB games in higher ranks and you will notice that when the games last longer, her win percentage in those longer games is less than win percentage in shorter games. Once people start grouping up and (hopefully) building MR, her job of one shotting the carry becomes harder because the whole team is around and will (again, hopefully) have any CC that can lock her down and make her into dinner for the team.  If you make it harder for her to one shot the carry, it might just gut her.\n\nThat being said, I absolutely despise LeBlanc, but I understand that there's ways to fight her, especially later into the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LordGeovanni","date":"2016-06-01T19:37:42.739+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its not a stun its a bs root with high damage.
