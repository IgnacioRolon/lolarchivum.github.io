He has a strong early game and transitions maybe a tiiiiny little bit to well into late game. Frankly I've seen j4's carry harder when they get fed. Sure Lee has nice room to outplay and good damage early from grabbing lw+hydra but a. you have to be able to outplay everyone which means you have to usually be better than those around you and b. if he doesn't get fed (really not that hard not to feed him like come on, hes not like shaco if you ward well around you, you will be fine) he's basically a bruiser that gets somewhat tanky late game. He's never gonna get as tanky as other champions and he is never gonna have as much damage as other champions unless he is incredibly fed. Most people here don't actually understand what needs to be nerfed about him they just lost to him once and now say *riot nerf lee sin gg wp*. No the only thing that needs to be nerfed is his kit. His numbers are actually perfectly balanced, he just doesn't have much counterplay (no this doesn't make him op it just means that he will perform consistently aka why he is picked in lcs). Simply slowing the speed of his first and second Q so you could outplay it or making his abilities cost more energy so he has to manage his resources better would balance him.
