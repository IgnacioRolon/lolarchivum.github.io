It run the game great. Fps usually goes around between 80  to 150 with ultra high setting. However, sometimes the FPS goes extremely low like I played a 30 mins game with 20 FPS - 30 FPS entire game. Once I restart my laptop then everything goes back normal but if I keep my laptop running for couples of hours the FPS drop will happen again. \r\nI noticed that if the client got laggy then the game will become laggy too. I turned off switching graphic card in the system setting but there's no change.\r\nRight now every time I start a new game I will test client around to check if client runs laggy. If client has super laggy animation then I will just restart laptop so everything goes back normal.\r\nI am not sure this is Mac os's issue or game's issue. My friends are using Windows and they has not encounter this kind of issue ever.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-15T02:28:46.340+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmmmm do me a favor and try turning on \"low-spec mode\" and \"close client during game\" which you can find in the client settings. Those can make the client run a little smoother, and I'm wondering if the client was what was lagging you down in game as well. Test those two out a couple times in a custom or practice match and let me know if that doesn't help at all.","replies":[]},{"poster":"snoochyp","date":"2018-02-17T17:20:17.320+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey,  \n\nI have the same issue. I found a fix for it. In your system Preferences set your screen resolution to the middle scaled option. I have had no issues since doing this.","replies":[]}]}
