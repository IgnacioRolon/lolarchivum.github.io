When I came back to look at the info for a champion I wanted to play, it was gone. Abilities are sill visible but it no longer has the mana cost, cooldown, or damage stats on the information page. Will this feature ever be brought back?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-10T01:12:40.829+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The ability descriptions on the champion information pages are meant to be quick little summaries of what that skill does. We didn't want to clutter the client with all the fine details of every ability, but you can still find all of those on our champion pages or other sites like Wikipedia.","replies":[{"poster":"PersuesAchilles","date":"2017-07-11T17:02:34.649+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you","replies":[]}]}]}
