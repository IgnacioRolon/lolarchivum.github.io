{"poster":"What are memes","date":"2018-07-20T04:37:21.959+0000","title":"Chat restricted","subforum":"Player Behavior","up_votes":1,"down_votes":7,"body":"Just wanted some opinions about this chat restriction I received.\n\nRundown of what happened: So at the beginning of the game our WU went into the enemy jungle alone to invade snd got first blooded, no one on our team said anything, it happens ya know just move on not a big deal ( the point of this being that he set himself behind from the start and it wasn&#039;t anyones fault other than his own). He then went bot and started red buff, from there he did his wolves and went top to do his blue (while he was doing wolves our mid lane died in a 1v1, so the enemy lux was the only one mid). He got to his blue buff and started it, at which point the enemy Xin (who was currently a level up on him and had first blood, starting with an extra long sword) showed up, wu pinged for assistance so seeing he was already behind and i had my lane pushed i came to help him out. I initially went up to xin and q auto him (Im GP) at which point lux showed up and kassadin was standing mid lane farming. Once this happened I (being about 60%hp) started to walk away to head back top, leaving wu to face the 50%hp xin and full hp lux on his own, I made this decision because i figured maybe at best we would go 1 for 2 if i stayed and lux would get even further ahead off that. After wu die he said &quot;i give up&quot; and then proceeded to walk straight to my lane and flash to smite a cannon away from me, he then came back 3 times each time taking some cs and the cannon. I asked him why he was doing this to me and he said it was because i ditched him when he was getting invaded, i begged him to stop because he was setting us both drastically behind and he refused. I recieved a 10 game chat restriction for using caps when i was asking him to not troll my lane and make the game impossible to win (we won in the end because the enemy xin ended up not liking his team and inting.... plat is a messed up elo). Anyways I just checked his op.gg today and see that he did not receive a ban or any disciplinary action for what he did (I&#039;m assuming he didn&#039;t get a chat restriction because all he really said was that he gave up and was trolling so the game would end faster). I feel this is a terrible injustice in the disciplinary system and that it likely happens too often, again I am looking for the communities opinion on this, is it worse to be upset when someone ruins your gameplay experience by singling you out to suffer and thus you rage at them a little (i never said any hate speech or told him to commit heinous acts against himself) or is it worse to be the person intentionally feeding/trolling a game to make it end faster? From my perspective it seems the latter is less punishable than the former.......\n\n<Removed by Moderation>","replies":[{"poster":"Sona Ping","date":"2018-07-20T04:43:14.575+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":">\"Just wanted some opinions about this chat restriction I received.\"\n\n> No chat anywhere in post.\n\nScreenshots, please.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Evangele","date":"2018-07-20T05:46:56.829+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:267}} Hey there,\n\nI removed your link to the player you are speaking about's opgg as it goes against our rules about Rank Shaming.
