I am currently stuck in a lobby with my friend. i am not the lobby owner so i cannot start the game. if someone invite me for a game, i get a message telling me to try again later. if i reboot my pc / relaunch the client, when i log in i get thrown in the lobby again. appened after waiting in lobby with said friend for many hours.\n\nCurrent patch 7.23 NA.\n~~Edit: Getting the league of legends installation file and repairing the LoL installation with it seems to have fixed it.~~\nEdit2: Nevermind, it did not work. as soon i went to start a new game, back at the ~~fucking~~ lobby. Gonna uninstall then reinstall and give news.\n\nEdit3: unistalled league completly, installed back, didnt work. ran CCLeaner with CCEnchancer to clear both the registry and temp files, didnt work. tried on a different computer with a different league installation, didnt work. I am out of ideas, issuing a support ticket.","replies":[]}]}]}
