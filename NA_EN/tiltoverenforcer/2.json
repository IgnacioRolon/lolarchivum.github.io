When I tried to hit \"record\" in the replay feature, the screen immediately froze and I bugsplatted. I sent in an error report, and then I loaded back into the replay to try recording again. Once more, the screen froze, but then it took a second or two before bugsplatting. I sent in another error report. I tried a couple more times, each one ending in either immediate failure, or failure after a few seconds. No luck.\r\n\r\nI tried again today, and I did have a little bit of success, in that I was able to record a couple clips, but they all just ended up having some weird static noises instead of the usual audio (Like this one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2u4yhMFEr4E). I closed off the client and rebooted it and went back into the replay, but I'm now having the same bugsplatting issue that I was the other day. And here I am now.\r\n\r\nI don't know if this is a common issue lately, but any assistance would be greatly appreciated! I know I sent in a couple bugsplats, but I'd like to have this resolved before the next patch lands, so I can still properly record this replay.
