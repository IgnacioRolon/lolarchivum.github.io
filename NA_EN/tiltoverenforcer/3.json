I was then put back into queue, and had a series of rapid games pop up where I clicked accept on all of them as they popped up, but none of them were formed. Eventually all 10 people clicked accept on a game, but I didn&#039;t make it into champ select. I was left with a completely dark screen where the client should be. I knew we were in champ select because if I tried to close the window, the window with the &quot;If you&#039;re in a league series it&#039;ll end your series&quot; popped up. So I sat there for a while sitting at a blank screen, and eventually I was kicked out because I couldn&#039;t ban a champion, and now I have to wait 30 minutes before I can play again, because of a bug in the updated client.\n\nIt was in my series to plat, by the way. If this costs me my series I&#039;m going to be pissed. I was 2W/1L so far.\n\nUPDATE: It didn't cost me my series, but now I'm 2W/2L. Thanks, client.","replies":[{"poster":"broccoflauer","date":"2017-03-04T18:36:22.846+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Seconded, although I simply get kicked out of queue over and over; whatever they were trying\nto accomplish by making a new client when this is what we get is beyond me. \nYes, I read all the flowery blubbergush, but fact is the\ngame hates the new client and the smallest tweak seems to have the potential to make it all unplayable!\nFrom day one, it's been inferior in any and all ways from what we had before.\n\nHate to rant but this really just came to a head for me.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Boltrix","date":"2017-03-04T06:07:43.476+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This just happened to me, I was queueing with friends and we kept returning to the role selection after players failed to accept invites. Then when I was brought into the champ select, I received a black screen and fiddling with the options (which showed up like normal) did nothing. The game was canceled as I couldn't select a champion to ban (I heard the sounds well enough to know what was happening) and then I was put into the champ select screen. I didn't bother but I already knew I was going to have a time penalty.\n\nI'm not really bothered by the penalty, I just hope I don't suffer from this later down the line at some point because of a bug like this.\n\nEdit: I'd like to add this bug didn't affect my party members, only me.","replies":[]}]}
