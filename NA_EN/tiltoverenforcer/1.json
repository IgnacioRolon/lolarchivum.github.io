According to [this](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005665088-Installing-the-updated-League-client#h2) page of Riot Support regarding the updated client, it will try to automatically convert your [old](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/article_attachments/115009860308/legacy-icon-small.jpg) desktop shortcuts to the [new](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/article_attachments/115009860288/new-icon-small.jpg) set of desktop shortcuts. However, a long time ago, before the client update, I pinned the LoL Launcher shortcut to my start menu, as seen [here](https://i.imgur.com/9tQAhi9.png). Now, since the shortcut I'm using is still the legacy shortcut, the Launcher will automatically try to update any legacy shortcuts on the desktop to the new shortcuts. But because the shortcut I'm using isn't technically on the desktop, it fails and has to try every time.\n\nI don't understand why it only really started happening a few days ago, but unpinning the legacy shortcut and pinning the new shortcut to the start menu resolved the issue. This might also be an issue when using Windows Classic Shell, if the Launcher doesn't know where to find the shortcut.","replies":[{"poster":"Phboomharris","date":"2017-11-23T19:52:45.598+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=TiltoverEnforcer,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=RbTvtWkb,comment-id=00000001,timestamp=2017-10-14T00:09:50.428+0000)\n>\n> I found out why it&#x27;s happening!

Resave a new shortcut in the same location you had it before and it will fix itself. \nGG <3","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Darkstar Annie","date":"2017-11-12T17:09:20.652+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"- I do not have a League of Legends desktop icon, \n- I do not have it pinned to task bar\n- Running the \"Quick Repair\" does not fix it\n- Running LeagueClient.exe does not fix it\n\nIt pops up this EVERY SINGLE TIME I start League no matter what.
