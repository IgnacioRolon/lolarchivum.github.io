It has happened and i get the low priority que for it. That is fine i understand it the first time but the FACT it happens every time i get off the lower que is nonsense. I have been a supporter of you and a word of mouth promoter but this game is becoming too costly to play, so i am going to offer a deal. Reset the lower que timer or delete it and ill continue playing and enjoying league or if you ignore me your game will no longer be worth a 20 minute wait to que up and que up mainly inn a losing game. ill no longer promote or speak of your game nor play it. i would understand if these punishments were strictly from me leaving but since these situations are 100% out of my control this offer is made. You decide.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-02T18:04:01.097+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Leaverbuster can only be reduced by playing constantly without interruptions.  The lower priority queue will be assigned to an account and potentially escalated as leaves continue to happen.  The system treats everyone equally regardless of intent because it causes others a negative experience.  The best thing you can do to resolve this is by fixing up whatever is causing your disconnections.  I'd be happy to help with this, just let me know what exactly you're experiencing and when you see it.  Let me know!","replies":[{"poster":"MakeshiftPlayer","date":"2016-08-02T18:45:43.795+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well today i was connecting to a game and everyone except one player on the other team was 100% that one player was stalled at 44%. It was not changing at all so i exit the the loading screen to reset it and it worked. BUT TOO BAD IT WAS 3 MINUTES IN WITH THE REMAKE SURRENDER 4/0....... THIS WAS NOT my doing and more along the side of the corporations. Now i have 4 more games to play with a 20 plus que usually 30 minute que to play a 40 minute game with about a 50/50 percent of winning. so i ask you would you even play this game if you had to wait 30 minutes to play one and recently due to volatility lose more than 50%?","replies":[{"poster":"MakeshiftPlayer","date":"2016-08-02T18:46:24.807+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Check my whole history leaving games is something i never if so rarely even do","replies":[]}]}]}]}
