While reinstalling is a safe step, there could be other outliers like outdated drivers or something else.  Run through each step of the [FPS issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting) guide to help troubleshoot.  Also, if you have Windows 10, try disabling the [Xbox Game Bar](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html) as it's been auto-enabled for some players and causing issues like this.
