I just do not feel like i can roam as i would get insta killed by the jungler if i were to get caught out. The main problem i struggle with is to save my adc, the potential is there but i feel like other supports are far more superior in saving and doing more dps than pyke wich is a shame cos the thematic and play style is very interesting to me.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Warlord Rhinark","date":"2018-06-01T10:35:25.042+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Bro he came out yesterday.\n\nYou can't expect to be a master on him when he hasn't even been out for a week yet.\n\nGet some practice on him first.","replies":[]},{"poster":"VonToothskie","date":"2018-06-07T04:02:22.205+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I main support in summoners rift, but i play ARAM way more.\nhe is the worst champion in the game in ARAM, period. his entire kit is tank abilities but he cant tank. hes incredibly easy to kill but cant harass.  his cast range is tiny. his whole kit screams frontline, but hes so fragile that by the time hes in range to cast anything the enemy control mage or adc has killed him. at this point in ARAM his perma corpse is basically a gold buff for the other team.\nHonestly before they announced his passive, he looked incedible. hopefully they change his passive so he can tank and lower his damage to compensate","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Malpercio","date":"2018-06-01T23:30:14.221+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He's honestly fine.
