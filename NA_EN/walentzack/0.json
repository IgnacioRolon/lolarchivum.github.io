Notice flames coming out of Tahm and the huge damage that Tahm takes :(\r\n\r\nThis looks like a bug to me, both visually and as damage behaviour.

I think even his animations change entirely so canceling the ult may model break or something? Something for riot to look into.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tormentula","date":"2016-10-04T22:52:58.478+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thats because its a directional ability attached to the model that's programmed to continue going under any circumstance. \n\nIts why using zhonyas and flamesplitter still works. \n\nIf flamesplitter lasted longer, or rumble's dance started sooner, super galaxy rumble would dance in flames. \n\nAnother interaction with kench and these abilities is jhin and lucian's ults will not cancel if allied kench eats them (unless they fixed that recently)","replies":[{"poster":"Walentzack","date":"2016-10-04T22:55:39.709+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well ok, but this was an enemy Rumble.  I mean surely, if you're an enemy devour should stop abilities no? I mean I wonder if the same happens when eating an enemy Morgana or Swayn during their ultimates... It looks severely bugged if they continue. ","replies":[]}]}]}
