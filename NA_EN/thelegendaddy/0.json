Have the minions&#039; health bars turn a different color indicating the next AA will kill and grant the gold. There are far too many instances where the minion will be left with 1 hp and be killed by your own wave. Quite an annoyance and would be a nice quality of life change. If someone is consciously trying to killshot minions and farm, it should not be such a hassle.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot MapleNectar","date":"2018-04-06T18:47:03.420+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think this is an interesting tactic for something like the tutorial or co-op vs ai to help players learn the skill of csing. I'd worry about making this a common feature, as last hitting is intended to be a skill test, and this would trivialize it quite substantially. I think execute thresholds like Ziggs W on tower is in a bit of a different camp because it's something you're going to use a long cd spell on with a very specific output as opposed to auto attacks which are up right away again. To be clear, I don't think the idea is bad, but don't think this should be a thing in the game for everyone.","replies":[{"poster":"redniwediS","date":"2018-04-06T18:55:53.891+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Definitely agree on this one, having a health bar change like this should be in line with the turret range indicator from custom games and the practice tool.","replies":[{"poster":"Kai Guy","date":"2018-04-06T19:32:52.098+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I whole heartedly support this for tutorial games, Vs Ai, And Practice tool.

I understand you want to lessen wave clear overall, but last hitting with many AP champs at the moment just feels aweful... with most you really can't do it unless you have played many games with them. For example Galio and Swain feel pretty bad. I don't think the amount of focus farming as a mage requires is fair/fun.\n\nLast hitting should be a tool to make engages in lane happen, not a meaningful skill tets by itself.","replies":[{"poster":"TheLegendaddy","date":"2018-04-07T08:02:12.918+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am a bit confused as to why hitting an AI minion is considered a skill test. I would say understanding the wave manipulation is the skill. Last hitting minions tends to be more of an annoyance in my experience, as there are so many instances where you feel robbed of it versus you legitimately missing the cs.","replies":[{"poster":"DeadUnborn","date":"2018-04-07T15:23:43.938+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I think minions should be executed below a certain health range by basic attacks. Whenever you last hit and miss them by the tiniest amount because their resistances just went up it feels really bad. For mages it feels aweful and unfair becaise they have to be way more precise with last hitting than AD carries","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"TheLegendaddy","date":"2018-04-07T07:58:22.655+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since the game is balanced based on high elo players, and high elo players do not struggle with cs, could a change like this benefit the majority of the playerbase? Since the majority happens to be bronze- gold skill level. Yes it would make farming easier, but it would also make the game more centric on brawling and people getting better mechanically at their champ.","replies":[]},{"poster":"5050BS","date":"2018-04-07T08:01:52.222+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh you mean like Garen getting a thing letting you know your ult will kill the target?","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheLegendaddy","date":"2018-04-06T23:19:51.388+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"With the game's current state, it feels like it has alot more emphasis on team fighting/target focus/knowing matchups than it does with csing. Most games, (unless a lane is completely shut out, which is also not a rewarding experience for the receiving end), the farm levels are quite similar on both teams (granted the mmr is even on both sides and they understand the importance of gold from minions) and it just becomes a monotonous requirement anyhow.  A small change like this to minions I think would actually just further support the game's current focus in being mechanically strong and champion knowledge, and fights you can pick or not pick. Ultimately, the last hitting mechanic is still there as well.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Malfectious","date":"2018-04-06T19:53:28.402+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Lol...there goes all skill expression for ADC's{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[{"poster":"TheLegendaddy","date":"2018-04-06T23:21:27.202+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i wouldn't say it completely rids of it, you still have to balance harass/trades with last hitting all the same, it would just lessen the amount of times you think you got the last hit, and you didn't.

This isn't going to make them anything crazily overpowered for waveclear but it would help them farm especially in the early game now that minions have gotten stronger.\n\nYou already give it to turrets I don't see the harm to minions -- not asking for 100% like it works for AD just something to nudge them in the right direction for all those mid laners who can't spam spells to last hit.","replies":[]}]}
