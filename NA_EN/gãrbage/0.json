I think I might know what happened though....\n\nWhen the client starts patching, it first needs to scan the game files to see what is going to be changing. If your OS blocks League from scanning those files, it can throw this error. Follow the steps in this [**permission guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) and you should be able to get that patch going again, but definitely hit me back if not!","replies":[{"poster":"Gãrbage","date":"2017-06-04T21:27:24.004+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I tried everything in the permission guide and I still have the same problem.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-04T22:54:57.913+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We could go ahead and try a repair in the client options, since this could also be happening if it keeps running into corrupted files while scanning files for the update.

Essentially you just have to hope for the best and try again later.  Literally the only fix I've found is to wait and try again every few hours.","replies":[]}]}
