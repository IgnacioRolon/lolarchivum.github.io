This week, though, the entirety of the vocal League-playing internet collectively lost its shit. Why? Because the game made a joke too funny for its own good.\r\n(A year ago this time....)\r\nAfter some prolonged artful teasing by Riot, the most ridiculous of League’s temporary game modes finally came back this week for April Fool’s day once again. So far, fans have responded to its second coming as if it was...the second coming.\r\nMany broke down and began thanking Riot profusely on the League forums and subreddit.\r\n\r\n\"THANK YOU RITO\r\nArdond NA Miscellaneous\r\nTHANK YOU SO MUCH, most of us jus wanted URF mode, but you not only made FIVE (once again FIVE) skins in addition to game mode, you also made 2 pieces of merch, 5 new summoner icons, death animations, and a new music sound track. This is better then christmas\r\n\r\n(This year....)\r\nThis years subreddit is the complete opposite. Riot is giving Trump a run for its money as most hated at the moment. A huge portion being upset over lack of URF or something equivalent, the rest just upset at those upset for being upset. Meanwhile Riot stays very quite...Very little adulation this year, hardly any laughs, an all around toxic atmosphere. What we need now is a sacrificial lamb. Give us the name of the Riot employee(s) (aka the GREAT OFFENDER OF 4/1/16) that stole URF and replaced with Draven, so we might roast him/her alive in a twentieth century internet witch hunt. Blood must pay for Blood. (You know who you are, have some honor and turn yourself over to us!) This is the only way to sake our thirst for URF Blood. (That and a WW skin wearing the carcass of the GREAT OFFENDER OF 4/1/16)\r\n\r\nThis is the only way to save Riot","replies":[{"poster":"DJ Katarina","date":"2016-04-02T17:27:58.678+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"or just fire that pleb","replies":[]},{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2016-04-02T18:23:03.527+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I personally didn't think riot was going to release urf this april fools.  Hell, they themselves stated that its not going to be released this year on april fools (and not in the joking manner they used when they announced nurf was coming and urf is not coming back (2015), they announced it in the rotating game mode update which was exactly that, an update)\n\nHoneslty I just can't understand why there are so many people butthurt at riot for not having it up.  Its going to come out anyways.  After the first few posts it just felt like people were jumping on the hate bandwagon. \n\nIf they end up releasing it before the weekend is up anyways (which it would have to be planned well in advance to do so) then all of the people whining are going to view it as riot listening to their stupid shit thus ending up with more whining on every other problem.\n\nJust my two cents.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Judges","date":"2016-04-02T17:28:20.231+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Riot has deleted my first post after hitting 2k views... It's a conspiracy! Trying to hide from their GREAT FAIL 4/1/16. Give us our sacrificial lamb, put an end to the toxic environment, save yourself Riot employees. I know even now a few of you are huddle together in dark corners of a cubicle discussing your options... should you narc aka turn over this GREAT OFFENDER? The short answer to that question is yes, save yourselves, save your company before its too late! He/she has brought this upon themselves, you shouldn't suffer for his/her crimes on humanity. I say again turn over the GREAT OFFENDER 4/1/16 before all is lost.","replies":[]}]}
