HMMMmmm when has this happened before? Mayhap thats how Riot got its start.\r\nHistory\r\n\r\nThe company known as Blizzard Entertainment, today owned by the dictatorship of Activision, created a new development team in 2006, including the names Brandon Beck, Marc Merill, and David Turley. These people were actually paid for nothing each month, and hadn't obviously been useful to the company. However, they were given one chance, before they were fired. Their task was to create a spin-off expansion to World of Warcraft, which was named \"World of Warcraft: League of Legends\" by the development team. David \"Phreak\" Turley, as he normally appears.\r\nMost things told that everything was going fine in the beginning, aside from the facts about the programming experience in the development team, and sinister rumors telling that the team lacked creativity. Unfortunately, the budget of the development team was cut 40% by the Blizzard board directors, as Blizzard themselves saw the results of a massive advertising campaign on the web, which failed miserably, as the rather naive directors didn't know that most people have adblock in their browsers, or just ignore the ads. When it proved that the campaign nearly was a total waste of money, and that it would have caused a massive loss to be shown in the economic year result at the end of 2006, Blizzard decided to cut their costs dramatically, just two months after that the development team was created, firing tons of personnel, and cutting budget costs.\r\nThe spin-off development team was one of the parts that suffered most, as their server division was given technology which dated out half a century ago. This budget cut did also affect the deadline of the development of the League of Legends spin-off. The rather stressed team was still in the brainstorming process, as they had wasted their time discussing side characters in Star Trek and telling penis jokes that obviously were too long. The mother company was not too pleased with their previous ideas.\r\nA breakthrough occurred in the team when it proved that one of the members was a former member of the internet community \"The Cracademy\", a hacking/cracking education website that is almost impossible to access in most countries, without using proxies. The team bought a copy of the popular MOBA Dota 2, and the mentioned Cracademy member cracked the game and copy-pasted the code inside the game files. From there, the team started to modify the Dota 2 programming codes. The development team, not too familiar with programming, decided to remove some of the key tags in the code, by the reason that they were \"hard to understand\". This obviously caused the League of Legends spin-off to be buggy, laggy and overall of crappy quality, which strangely wasn't noticed by the ignorant development team. The game was reported \"finished\" in 2007, when it actually still was in \"pre-alpha-stage\" of development, and shortly after that, released onto the market. In order to play the game, one was needed to pay an extra fee of 5 US dollars each month, in addition to the usual WoW subscription cost.\r\nAfter a few months, results arrived, and these results were no good news for the development team. The results proved something similar to a disaster. Aside from the lack of performance and quality as mentioned above, the reason why people didn't like the spin-off was that the similarities to the original WoW were so few that a comparison between the spin-off and the original game would have been equivalent to the comparison of a wooden door and a computer. One month later, Blizzard Entertainment decided to close down the spin-off. The development team was though able to break loss from Blizzard, and their game was saved. \"World of Warcraft: League of Legends\" was thereby renamed to just \"League of Legends\". The development team, now a free-standing company, named themselves \"Riot Games\".\r\nTwo months passed, before the company went bankrupt. For some unknown reason, the Russian petroleum company, Gazprom, decided to buy the bankruptcy's estate. Since then, they have always neutralized the always negative results from Riot Games by the profit earned from their overpriced natural gas, which is mainly sold in Europe. \r\n\r\n\r\nMayhap history is about to repeat itself and crown a new King!\r\nGo Devs","replies":[{"poster":"Quazzymooto","date":"2016-04-02T19:45:27.895+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"So, this wall of text and no mention of the original creators of DOTA?\n\nRegardless if this guy is a troll or not here goes a short version-\n\nThe original team (which I don't think had any employment ties to blizz at the time) including Icefrog and many others that worked tirelessly on what seemed to be the original MOBA (at least to those who had not played the SC version). If memory serves me right, a breakup of this group was caused when one side went for an interview and accepted responsibilities to create DOTA2. When this surfaced it caused great controversy, most work on the original DOTA was ceased immediately. Effort was put into new versions of the game and ended with 3 different groups: DOTA2 crew, LOL crew, and HON crew. Thus came the era of MOBAS. \n\nIn all honesty, (penis jokes aside) I think that your statement has a bit to much \"speculation\".\n\n-Quazzy\n(Someone that was around and involved in the creation/update process of the original DOTA on the WC3 engine.)","replies":[]},{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2016-04-02T18:57:16.487+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Holy shit that wall of text.
