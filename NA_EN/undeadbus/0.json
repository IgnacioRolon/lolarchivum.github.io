Most toplanes are not able to trade with Lissandra because she has long range and there is no way to all in 1v1, because she has cc and escape, so only way to stay on lane is to dodge her skills, but it's very difficult.","replies":[{"poster":"Faith Breaker","date":"2015-02-23T11:34:18.582+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"The initial spell width and range is easily avoidable. You're only being nailed with her q after she aims it at the minion wave and it breaks apart increasing in width, and gaining added range. Farm the minion wave from the side, don't LET Lissandra keep smashing you in the face with her q. As a Lissandra player, it's actually very frustrating to hit an enemy with your q outside of the lane phase, as you have to get very close for it to strike. With minions around it's rather easy to. It's like MF's q, you can get the second shot to bounce off a Caster minion and seemingly have TONS OF RANGE against the enemy. The answer is to step aside and don't remain behind your caster minions. I think alot of people's lane phase would greatly improve from the simple act of farming from the side of the minion wave rather then behind it or directly within the minion skirmish. Please don't ask Riot to nerf a champion with a clear identity and easily recognizable strengths and weaknesses. Lissandra top is fine. Her q is fine. Stop letting her kick your ass.
