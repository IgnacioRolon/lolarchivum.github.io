I also felt that a few of the dialogue choices both in the season finale, and some of the writing in episodes like Vindicators 3, really just left me scratching my head; and trust me it has nothing to do with theoretical physics.\r\n\r\nI found a lot more inconsistencies in this season than I did in the more previous seasons, and it feels like the writers used ricks gadgets as an ex machina to write themselves out of a hole but didn&#039;t keep in mind continuity.\r\n\r\nIn the episode &quot;Whirly Dirly Conspiracy&quot; its revealed that rick has some Class-whatever augmentation, and after the whole wormhole experience he reveals his arm to be some whack ass gun thing, but in the same season, a few episodes later, he gets that same arm torn off by a giant bird thing. I feel like all they&#039;d have to do, continuity wise, is swap the times these episodes took place, and the story would work fine still, it&#039;d justify him having the augments, and explain why the augments wouldn&#039;t hinder the bird in tearing his arm off in the first place.\r\n\r\nOh, wait.\r\n\r\nIn the vindicators episode, he&#039;s revealed to have some sort of force field thing that prevents the Ghost Train guy from choking him out. That same thing would prevent the bird from being able to touch him, so really, the same holes they wrote themselves out of with the gadget porn, ended up leading to more continuity errors, which i feel is kinda...just not good of the writers to do.\r\n\r\nThe best episode of the season Is the Ricklantis Mixup, in which the the main focus is the citadel, and Evil Morty&#039;s democratic take over. As much as the commentary of this episode could be considered heavy handed, the impact of the end of the episode was far greater, both in tone and execution, than the season finale. \r\n\r\nIf the season finale and Ricklantis mixup switched places, or, honestly if the season finale didn&#039;t exist, and the season was only 9 episode&#039;s long, the season would still work, it&#039;s ending impact would match its predecessor, and leave the viewer with plenty of questions. But instead, we get...well.\r\n\r\nThe Rickchurian Mortydate (Which is a clever name) is 50% action gadget porn and 50% odd dialogue writing.\r\n\r\nThe biggest thing is it feels like a lot of the characters, mainly the president, talk in run off sentences. And Rick&#039;s motivations are highly inconsistent to his motivations previously established in the season.  Unless the selfie was for rick, but really, I feel it doesn&#039;t make a lot of sense for rick to risk the integrity of the timeline they&#039;re in just for a selfie. It feels far too illogical for him.\r\n\r\nAlso as much as people want to say rick is an athiest he 100% believes in god, but only when convienient.","replies":[]}
