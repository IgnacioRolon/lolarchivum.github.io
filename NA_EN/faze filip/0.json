First, you'll only get a chest for a teammates' S-grade if they are in your premade group. If they were just some random person you were paired with through matchmaking, their S-grade will not grant you a chest. Additionally, you'll need to ensure you're playing a large pool of champs if you want to earn a lot of chests. This is because you can only earn one chest on each champion per season, and premade teammates' S-grades that grant you a chest will count towards the single chest you can earn for that champ.\n\nCheck out our [Hextech Crafting Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207884233-Hextech-Crafting-Guide) for additional details on how the system works.
