How are you!!\r\n\r\nI have searched for any topic with any information about this, but I didn&#039;t found, so here is my question:\r\n\r\nCould Riot put the scores of the music tracks that they have put for us on free?\r\n\r\nI&#039;m studying music and there are so many themes I would like to cover with my band, but I only could cover Lightbringer - Pentakill because there were no more scores from the album (Smite &amp; Ignite).\r\n\r\nHere is my request. I would love Riot could do that, but I can imagine there must be some legal therms from the composers, but I had to try.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention and sorry if my english is not good enough, it&#039;s not my language :S.","replies":[{"poster":"Ed the Conqueror","date":"2015-10-20T01:24:29.778+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nThanks for your interest in discovering more of our sheet music. \n\nAt this point, the only thing we can say is that we are actively working on releasing more sheet music to our players. We’re still working on format, content, release date, etc. \n\nWhen we’re ready, rest assured we’ll let you all know on these forums! \n\nThe Riot Music Team","replies":[]},{"poster":"SOLOSINCONDON ","date":"2015-10-19T11:05:51.341+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i want scores too!","replies":[]}]}
