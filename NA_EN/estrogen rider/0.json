She's just extremely frustrating to play against. Her combination of mobility, high sustain, and her absurd damage being front-loaded into her Q makes her generally frustrating to play against. Riot's nerf isn't going to really address any real problem. Most Nidalee players aren't going to land a spear and dive into the enemy team for the assassinate in a team fight anyways. They reworked her so that she wouldn't only be a spear chucking siege champ late game. Unfortunately, she still is. She now just has more potential to delete things off of a snowball from the huge power she got to her early game kill potential. She's too safe for what she does. Take some of the damage out of the Q and put it into her cougar form, so that she still has assassination potential without having access to those nukes she calls a Javelin Toss.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Saianna","date":"2015-04-08T08:07:20.645+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Though you meant Lee for a second!\nBut then i realised you didn't mention his shields every ~5s and Aoe magic DMG scalling with his AD","replies":[]},{"poster":"Aatrox Herself","date":"2015-04-08T02:41:31.235+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"What if I told you, the red pill was a roofie.","replies":[]}]}
