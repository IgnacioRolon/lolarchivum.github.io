I get put in a game with a premade of 4 people. I get shit on in top lane, camped by enemy jungle and have a hopelessly bad lane phase. My jungler literally does nothing to help me but I dont say anything. After a failed ff vote at 15 mins I pretty much give up on the game. I cant farm or get back into it and the enemy team is winning in every lane. Suddenly the adc on my team starts flaming me and blaming me for the game, so I defend myself in chat and point out what my teammates could have done to help the situation. I did not afk, I did not stop playing, and I did not even curse or say anything rude. I did die a lot but thats because the enemy team were all fed and we did not ff.\r\n\r\nAfter the game my whole team (premade 4) reports me and I get a chat restriction and lose all my honor. so my question is why even bother trying to build up honor again? any 4 man can just report you and you are instantly punished. since when can you get a chat restriction for not even saying anything bad? the whole report system is such a joke, allowing butthurt losers to ruin someone elses experience is the opposite of what riot claims they are trying to achieve.","replies":[{"poster":"Umbral Regent","date":"2020-01-05T01:32:27.099+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"> any 4 man can just report you and you are instantly punished.\n\nIt doesn't work like that. Reports only trigger a review, and the review doesn't take how many reports were received into consideration.\n\nIf you haven't cleared your chat restriction, I suggest you copy and paste the chat logs here; you wouldn't have gotten punished for no reason, so odds are fairly high that you're either missing something or ignoring your own misbehavior out of bias.\n\nAnd in case you doubt me on number of reports not mattering, here's [a quote from Riot Tantram sharing a snippet of the IFS code.](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/9VrUtrJo-being-solo-and-having-a-team-report?comment=0000000000020000000000000000)\n\n> Reports haven't lost weight since the instant feedback system was put in place.\n> \n> It's actually really simple.\n> \n> if (reports > 0) {\n> review();\n> }\n\nIt reads the value stored in the \"reports\" variable as a boolean flag, and if there's any number of reports greater than a value of zero, it calls the \"review()\" function. Also worth pointing out; it's \"review()\", not \"review(reports)\", meaning that the review of your behavior is not influenced by the amount of reports you receive. Once the review() function is called, the amount of reports don't matter.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Arammus","date":"2020-01-05T06:26:49.456+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"reported 3 times in 8 years...\nyou know mods can warn me for what im about to say next but sorry it has to be said:\nin my 26 years of lifetime, i have never read a more delusional statement EVER!\nthis honestly takes the crown.\nif this guy would send in a ticket requesting to see how many reports he got in his last 100 games, he'd prob die from the shock.\n\nbut to make my command \"helpful\"\nwell you said you complained in chat and wanted to ff... so you broke the rules and got punished for it. whats the problem? \nthe only \"power\" 4man premades have is that its more likely you'll get reported. thats it. with 4 randoms the chance of them \"forgiving\" you or just forgetting to report you is high. but with premades that are in voice, one will remind to report you.\nthats literally all their \"power\"","replies":[{"poster":"NF Remilia","date":"2020-01-05T08:08:55.708+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Only 3 times in 8 years this guy is a legend lol on my main acc that i had from season 1 i have around 2k reports , still waiting for my first restriction tho : [","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Timethief49","date":"2020-01-05T01:20:40.902+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"4 reports is the same as 1, they only result in a review of the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2020-01-05T03:07:15.460+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your behavior isn't nearly as good as you think it is.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Roger Fakerer","date":"2020-01-05T02:05:16.112+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"how do you see the chat log from the client is there any way?\ni wont bother with a support ticket, riot will never reverse a decision","replies":[{"poster":"Umbral Regent","date":"2020-01-05T02:10:37.432+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> how do you see the chat log from the client is there any way?\n\nIf you haven't cleared the punishment yet, you should be greeted with your chat logs any time you open the Client.\n\n> i wont bother with a support ticket, riot will never reverse a decision\n\nKei143 wasn't necessarily recommending an appeal through Riot Support, but rather that Riot Support can also bring up your chat logs if you can't get them from the Client.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2020-01-05T01:50:13.529+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe you should look at your chatlog closely and identify what is wrong in your chat. \n\nIf you can't identify your own, you can paste you chatlogs here or submit a ticket to Riot support.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Roger Fakerer","date":"2020-01-05T03:15:11.671+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":8,"body":"so saying anything unproductive in chat is bannable?

You're not given free reign to break the rules just because someone else broke them first.

Your report was valid and will count against them - it may not get them punished from that match alone, depending on their behavioral history, but it can and will add up eventually.\n\nRegardless, whether or not they got punished does not matter in regards to _your behavior_ and _your punishment_. You clearly have a history of misbehavior, given that you said yourself this is your second Chat Restriction.\n\nSo stop focusing on irrelevant details, like whether or not other players got punished or how you only responded to flame, and take a moment to take stock of your behavior. If you don't learn and change your behavior, you're just going to get punished again - and if this punishment was a 25-game Chat Restriction, then your next punishment is going to be a 14-day ban, and after that, a permanent ban.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Roger Fakerer","date":"2020-01-05T02:15:25.847+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"Game 1\nIn-Game\nRoger Fakerer: you let voli get 3 plates while failing an invade on red :P ekko bro pls help\nRoger Fakerer: gg\nRoger Fakerer: im not\nRoger Fakerer: maybe you should pay attention to your own lane/\nRoger Fakerer: well i got ganked 3 times in the first 6 mins\nRoger Fakerer: while our jungler did nothing, then voli easily roamed and cleanup up\nRoger Fakerer: not sure what you want me to do\nRoger Fakerer: or we could just ff\nRoger Fakerer: ?\nRoger Fakerer: yah but im not telling you what to do\nRoger Fakerer: but if you tell me not to int\nRoger Fakerer: then you go an int\nRoger Fakerer: its odd\nRoger Fakerer: so you are allowed to run it down but if I try and cs its inting?\nRoger Fakerer: at least dont be a hypocrite\nRoger Fakerer: what were you JUST doing?\nRoger Fakerer: trying to take a tower alone with no vision\nRoger Fakerer: you died at their turret lmao\nRoger Fakerer: you keep saying my score like that somehow makes it ok for you to do what you are telling me not to do\nRoger Fakerer: its fine for him to say what he likes, but he should not go and do the very thing he asked me not to do\nRoger Fakerer: it doesnt help his cause\nRoger Fakerer: ...\nRoger Fakerer: maybe gank a lane next time ekko, a decision you clearly decided not to make\nRoger Fakerer: im just saying he could have helped\nRoger Fakerer: you are all full of great suggestions after the game was lost\nRoger Fakerer: you watched from nearby in the jungle as I got repeat ganked\nRoger Fakerer: then you watched my tower die while you tried to invade\nRoger Fakerer: im not blaming you for my deaths\nRoger Fakerer: im pointing out you did nothing to help my lane\nRoger Fakerer: k w/e\nRoger Fakerer: int with me? all you had to do was gank\nRoger Fakerer: delusional cait thinks she only has 1 death\nRoger Fakerer: but i guess you guys are a premade\n\nI don't see anything here to cause a chat restriction.\nEspecially considering I did not say a word to anyone until my teammates started flaming me.\nOf course this log only shows what I said and not what was being said to me.\nStill, what here did I say that is worth reporting?","replies":[{"poster":"Umbral Regent","date":"2020-01-05T03:11:25.512+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Of course this log only shows what I said and not what was being said to me.\n\nWell, would you rather get punished for other players' behavior?\n\nChat logs only show _your_ behavior because you are punished for _your_ behavior alone.

Stop agonizing over how your teammates didn't help you early on and just take your own advice:\n\n> Roger Fakerer: maybe you should pay attention to your own lane/\n\nBecause, seriously. Getting bent out of shape and focusing so much on how your teammates didn't help you or gank you or whatever else _is not going to help, **especially if you constantly harass them about it.**_\n\n> I don't see anything here to cause a chat restriction.\n\nThe vast majority of this chat log is negative, full of detrimental arguments and littered with the occasional insult. You weren't punished because a 4-man premade reported you, you were punished because you wasted so much time harassing and arguing with your team when you could've just muted them and played the game.\n\nIn the future, here's my advice:\n\n1) **Don't harass your teammates when asking for help.** Berating your teammates by commenting on how they \"failed an invade\" or blaming them for your lane opponent gaining ground on you only serves to make them **not** want to gank you. If you can't settle for \"could I get a gank please?\" with maybe an added \"things are getting pretty rough\", _don't even ask._\n2) **Don't get hung up on singular mistakes.** The majority of that match had you arguing and harassing your team over the fact that you didn't get ganks early on, and guess what? _What you did was flame your team._ It doesn't matter if you didn't respond until they flamed you first (which I frankly doubt, given the very first line in your log), _you flamed them as well, and you were just as bad as them._\n3) **If someone flames you, _mute them and ignore them._** Don't say anything to them, don't say anything about them, don't even give them the time of day. If they flame you, they are entirely unreasonable and there is **zero** benefit to trying to communicate with them. Fullmute them to shut them down, and then don't say anything even vaguely relating to them.\n4) **Don't be a defeatist.** Excessive defeatism brings down your team's morale (and makes them less likely to cooperate with you - why help someone who thinks the match is already lost?) and doesn't help. Don't say early ggs, don't say \"ff@whenever\", if you think the match is lost, **keep it to yourself and play it out.** You can open a Surrender vote when it's available, but for real, just keep that negativity out of chat.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MotherKaiser","date":"2020-01-05T09:45:07.177+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Your chat log is really toxic.\nPunishment deserved.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Yin Yang Taoist","date":"2020-01-05T11:07:38.209+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Roger Fakerer,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=2JIOMMPE,comment-id=,timestamp=2020-01-05T01:19:41.461+0000)\n>\n\n> \nso I defend myself in chat and point out what my teammates could have done to help the situation.
