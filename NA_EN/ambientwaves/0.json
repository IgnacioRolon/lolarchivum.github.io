It kinda reminds me of Nvidia&#039;s TDR issues but only occuring with rek&#039;sai and no other champions. It&#039;s proven a rather pain to play against or with a Rek&#039;sai. since somehow it crashes my laptop about 20% of the time she unborrows when I&#039;m playing against, as i&#039;m playing with her it&#039;s about 60% which is kinda annoying with restarting computers. I&#039;m not sure if this is a bug to do with the model, game, client or just Nvidia in general.\r\n\r\n{{champion:421}}  I don&#039;t know what is is about Rek&#039;sai that crashes it even if I turn all my graphics and so forth to the lowest it still happens. thank you for looking into it, or if you know whats causing it. If it&#039;s Nvidia somehow causing this I&#039;ll be more happy to post a full on length post and give them a piece of my mind.","replies":[{"poster":"AmbientWaves","date":"2015-06-29T01:51:17.723+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The base skin. it still happens when I repair the actual game, I'm not sure why it's not repairing/redownlading the missing .dds","replies":[]},{"poster":"AmbientWaves","date":"2015-06-28T09:57:56.984+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"on a side note. since it seems to be when I am borrowed using tremor sense I think it might be this...since it's most I see in each R3D log.\n\n> 000018.448|       0.0000kb|      0.0000kb added|  ERROR| Failed to load RekSaiW.dds\n000018.448|       0.0000kb|      0.0000kb added|   WARN| r3dTexture EX: RekSaiW.dds - not found.
