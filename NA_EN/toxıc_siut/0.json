Only a handful of Rioters even reply on the forums to begin with, out of those few it may be that none of them have the expertise or knowledge necessary to reply to your thread. Then there is the fact that they kind of have their jobs to do and replying to every post made on the forums they can answer is not in their job description. Those who post on the boards do it because they want to, not because they have to.\n\nThe likelyhood is that your thread was seen by one of them, a note was taken on your suggestions/opinions and compiled with the greater majority and weighed against what they could do and implement. Everyone would love to be able to tell riot what they should do to the game that they think will make it better. But if they did that the game would, to put it bluntly, suck.\n\nThe fact is for the longest time Riot felt it was unnecessary to even include any other camera options because the opinion was that as you improved you would see the benefit of the free camera and learn to use it. Them changing this stance and including more options is huge and while I am sure there are even more good ideas out there it comes down to whether something meets certain qualifications.\n\nIs it possible?\nIs there time?\nIs there room?\nDoes another feature already provide a similar benefit?\nHow much benefit will the playerbase see from adding this feature?\n\nand I am sure many more...\n\ntruth be told Ideas are extremely easy to come by in the industry. Everyone has some they want to share and have them become reality. All Riot would have to do is ask for suggestions and the boards would probably break from all the people trying to get their 2 cents in. Am I saying what you have to say is insignificant, no I am not. but you have to understand when posting suggestions for Riot that they are busy and can not always take the time to reply. Sometimes you get lucky and they do, but typically it will get missed. That is just how things go. If you really want to be heard, try to find other who are also passionate about the subject or idea you have. Work with them to try and come up with some data and reasoning why your idea should be considered. You are more likely to be heard as a group compared to an individual in a sea of noise.","replies":[{"poster":"Dr Easter","date":"2015-04-08T11:17:58.326+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Excuse me if this camera, if made correctly, would help [people that really needs this](http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/2a1t9g/playing_lol_with_my_feet/ciqr0cv) and was the one that had a [ton of support from the comunity](http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/2h4lrp/semi_locked_camera_request/)  and also was the one that [people lamented quite a lot when Riot said it was banned](http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/25dq62/riot_officially_forbid_lolcamera/)\nOh and let's not forget this camera was made by a PLAYER called Spl3en.\nRiot does not have to take all the ideas from player. But excuse me [if one of the the first request for this camera was posted about 2 years ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1bnokx/new_camera_idea/) and the camera[ became a reality made by a PLAYER a few months after that](http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1jhd7r/lolcamera_a_new_way_to_play/).

Right... what do I know...?","replies":[{"poster":"Jingerbeardman","date":"2015-04-08T22:42:05.289+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Right off the bat I can tell you one big obstacle that kept this style of camera from going into the game. Spl3en has an intellectual copyright on the concept and for riot to implement it they would need consent from him for fear of legal repercussions. (I think that is the case at least. It works that way in other industries but I can not say for certain if it is the same for gaming code.)\n\nThe ban on 3rd party mods was a blanket ban and not only to this mod, so if you do not understand why they went in this direction I'm not sure what to tell ya. The mod directly modified the way the game was played and that is against the terms of use and you should feel lucky that they were lenient and didn't ban those who were using it even before their ruling (because it was against the ToS even before that).\n\nIt is cool that a player took this challenge on in his spare time and made it public for others to use. Companies are not able to simply adopt whatever someone outside of their walls creates and implement it into their games or whatever it may be. refer to my first paragraph in this post for reasons.\n\nNext, Just because a single Riot employee comes forward and says that the concept is \"dreamy\" and is a \"great idea\" does not mean they speak on behalf of Riot as a whole. Everyone has their individual opinion and are entitled to it, even if that opinion comes from a Riot employee.\n\nYou also have misquoted your last piece of evidence. RiotBoourns did say the code for Spl3ens mod was straightforward, but he did not say that it was \"not to difficult\" to implement. In fact he says the exact opposite, that he was unable to get it to work correctly, and could not replicate the way Spl3ens mod functioned. What he was referring to when he said, \"I don't think the actual coding is tremendously difficult,\" is that whatever solution they do end up implementing may not be difficult to code with regard to what he was describing in the previous paragraph. He then goes into detail as to why it is not easy to implement different camera models.\n\nLastly, the subject your thread is about has already been addressed and received comments from multiple different Riot employees in the past. Trying to dredge up old subjects already concluded is like rubbing salt in an open wound. Your thread likely isn't the first to voice your opinions on the new camera option and likely is not the last. Riot can not sit down and respond to every single one of these threads that gets made because it would be such an incredible waste of resources and time that needs to be spent developing the game. They expect people posting new threads to search the boards for similar topics in order to find the answers they are looking for instead of always making a new topic asking for Riot's attention.\n\nOn a final note, your thread is not even trying to propose a new idea. Nor is it filing a legitimate petition about a subject you would like them to reconsider. Neither is it presenting a friendly debate in which to discuss your solution. It is instead an attempt at calling Riot out on why they did not do things the way you wanted them to and insisting that you get what you want because you are not the only one that feels that way. The worst part is that you took the time to look up the subject you posted on, knew they had given responses to it in the past, and posted your thread anyways. Your thread is what I like to call a phishing thread, you try to lure and bait someone from Riot to respond to you, not to have a discussion, but to bombard and attack them with questions and statements about why they didn't do what you wanted.\n\nIf you want a real response, be constructive and courteous in your post. Research all the various sides of the debate, try to understand why they went with the iteration they implemented. If you still feel your solution is better and is enough of an improvement that it should be considered, create a thoughtful post that presents ample evidence and reasoning for it. Compare and contrast your solution to what is currently implemented in a way that promotes discussion. Then be open to discuss what others have to say. Do not be closed to having your opinion changed depending on the evidence and reasoning others present. If you follow these steps the likelihood someone from Riot will respond to your thread will be leaps and bounds above your current chances.","replies":[{"poster":"Dr Easter","date":"2015-04-08T22:59:04.491+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You wrote a lot and said nothing.

What the company thinks is good for the game is vastly different from what the community's opinion of balance/art direction/whatever people moan about is.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rrett","date":"2015-04-08T00:24:55.805+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Having nice discussions on the forum With them also doesn't mean they won't ignore any well thought out and agreed upon input either.\n\nThey listen, they also ignore as well.","replies":[]},{"poster":"im always salty","date":"2015-04-07T23:03:22.333+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"they could make different server locations and have more then one server considering they have one right now for north america but china ( a smaller land mass ) has about 20 servers","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mecha MaIphite","date":"2015-04-07T22:34:27.545+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kind of like how raging at your team doesn't magically turn them into LCS players.","replies":[]},{"poster":"wop","date":"2015-04-07T21:36:48.849+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"*write","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rivvy","date":"2015-04-07T21:48:41.006+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"So 4 years of insightful posts have fixed...?","replies":[]}]}
