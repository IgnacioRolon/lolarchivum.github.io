I don't pick him to be a tank, I pick him because he's a fighter.  HE DOES DAMAGE.  His whole kit is built to chase.  He can duel people.  He has two disables when he ganks.\n\nHis Q and current passive make him do damage, but most importantly help him to chase his targets down.  If they run by anything while being chased, I will press q and it will help me catch them... at least it used to.  Now I lose the 6 to 18% movespeed on top of having my base speed down.  What's the point of lowering the cooldown if I'll get kited and can't use it?\n\nFor his W: huge indirect nerf.  His w movespeed would stack with both his base and q movespeed.  Since he maxes q first, at max rank I lose 6-12-18% movespeed that I would have gained from q stacks, on top of the 15 flat lost from my base speed.  \nSo, max movespeed of a chasing Skarner is now down from **472.2** (without boots! with maxed q and w) to **382.8 **(maxed w, q doesn't matter; no boots)   [calculated from base m.s x 3q passive stacks x w ratio when fully ramped up]\n\nNow for his e, You waste the slow through stunning them.  Since you have to basic attack to do damage and reset your q, you'll never use the 2 second slow, cause you've removed his chase tools. He'll now q then stun... and then what... wait for e/w cooldown?\n\nA Skarner doesn't run in and e right away and if he missed RIP gank (like amumu q before 6)\nA Skarner gank is supposed to be cut off escape, q them till his passive is up then stun, and have his e for if the laner escapes and he needs to keep chasing.\nSkarner is not Udyr with a condition on bear stance.  That is what his new e is.  I get e on as many targets as possible then I have 5 seconds to bear, bear, bear, bear.\n\nAnd what's with the chalice?  If you're spamming w so much buy a tear, dont afk near krug or gromp camp.  It's like saying Udyr is mana hungry then spamming his bear stance with a single point in it to each camp.  \n\nI play Skarner to chase, to run, and pick people off.  \"You'll never escape.\"  His abilities all worked for these three purposes.  \n\nNow he's Nunu in the Definitely not Udyr skin  playing Dominion on Summoner's Rift.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Matezoide","date":"2015-08-04T20:21:15.261+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":3,"body":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSok_aw9pHc","replies":[]},{"poster":"Malicious Fury","date":"2015-08-05T00:50:07.432+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=DrCyanide,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=bIfdl5oa,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-08-04T19:49:43.048+0000)Skarner gets a rock.

What if I want to invade and kill the other jungler while they're taking a camp? That's a damn shame. There's no rock there so I'm effectively losing out on the power spike I had before through Q and his old passive. Which, let's be honest, was pitiful enough early game. Udyr would just turn around, bop me in the face while tanking red, and kill me. That's how underwhelming Skarner's bases are.  I can't ramp up attack speed to beat him or movespeed to run away since both of them are removed. I want to take Scuttles? Slower than before. My own jungle camps? Better be a rock or it's slower. Stuck fighting in an odd place? I'm worthless. I might as well switch to Trundle or Xin or Udyr. They all get attack speed buffs on their kits anywhere they want.
