The thing is, no one can fault FNC for not pausing either.\r\n\r\nIf there&#039;s a game changing bug, the game can be restarted. The problem is, against an opponent like SKT, FNC were most likely doubtful they could pull off an early game like they had that match. Their best chance of winning was to push through the bad situation that the bug left them in and try and pull it back.\r\n\r\n**Basically, FNC didn&#039;t remake the game because they were afraid they couldn&#039;t reproduce all the work they&#039;d done so far.**\r\n\r\nHow do replays factor into this? Look at Starcraft 2 replays. Starcraft 2 replays let you resume the game from any point, and swap out the players if you want. While there are many fun and useful aspects of having this feature for every day players, one of the big reasons this should be considered is the eSport value.\r\n\r\nIf replays were built into League, FNC would have paused the game, the game would have been &quot;rewound&quot; 5 seconds or so before the bug, and the game would have resumed from there. No drastic change to the game, no SKT second chance at the early game, no &quot;Sej forgot Arctic Assault and learned Distortion&quot;, none of that. \r\n\r\nAs an added bonus, it&#039;d make debugging these freak instances easier for you! You know that the bug happened at this point, you can replay that point over and over and over again until you can duplicate it and figure out what&#039;s going on.\r\n\r\nWhat stage of development have Replays gotten to, and what&#039;s the plans for their continued development and release?","replies":[{"poster":"AMYS GRAVE","date":"2015-05-12T18:57:38.770+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, i think replays should be implemented for different reasons.

I mean rewind 5 seconds, and you know where your enemies are positioned for a teamfight. Rewind 30, before the teamfight, someone might build something differently or take a different route. They might get a dragon steal, they hadn't gotten in the fight previously. Just rewinding 5 seconds can have as drastic an impact as playing through with the bug.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2015-05-13T17:44:15.526+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is there a place where Riot lists what champions are banned in competitive?

People who are proponents of instant replay state things like, \"The most important thing is to get the call right\" or \"We just want the right team to win.\"  I disagree with the first thought in that the experience for spectators is just as important as \"getting the call right\".  If you have to stop play to rectify bad calls too often, it makes the game feel disjointed by interrupting the flow of the game.\n\nI also don't necessarily agree that correcting situations like this (whether you are talking about a bad call by the refs or a game play bug) is necessary in order for the right team to win.  Blown calls can happen to both sides, and part of being a champion is the ability to overcome adversity, even ones that seem unfair.","replies":[{"poster":"I Guess Support","date":"2015-05-14T22:36:33.749+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I disagree with your last sentiment.  While, yes, part of being a champion is overcoming adversity, that shouldn't be done so because of factors outside of play that you inevitably have no control over.  Adversity is overcoming your own bad play to pull out a win, or overcoming a key injury to your team and coming out on top. Things like that.  Not something like a bug that shouldn't be there.  Perceived unfairness is one thing.  But actual unfairness is a completely different beast altogether.  Sports is great because people are put on EQUAL playing fields and asked to use their skills to come out on top.  Not count on random advantages that occur.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Vixanys","date":"2015-05-12T18:38:12.866+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Fnatic was given instructions about what to do in the event of a bug. They are to pause the game and report it to a ref. They didn't, likely because they thought they could still win and a remake would have been more detrimental to the series.\n\nI also agree with MVDuneCats, too many replays is just like too many interviews/features or too much time on the analyst's desk.
