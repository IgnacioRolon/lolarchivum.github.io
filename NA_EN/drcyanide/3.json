I tried to back it up with a bit of what I think made them look bad in the post, but I'll go into more detail.\n\n> Zed\n> What would you change to make it spooky or scary?\n> Do you dislike them as a whole, is the color the issue?\n\nI think it primarily is a color issue. Them being claws instead of the normal blades actually looks pretty cool, and fits with a Halloween theme, but I can't for a moment take the skin seriously with the colors.\n\nIn comparison to Viktor (which I think looks great) there's a lack of contrast in the skin. Viktor has dark armor areas accented by glowing parts, Zed has a far shinier armor which blends in with the glowing parts. Darkening the armor a bit could help, even if it's not as dark as Viktor's. Additionally, changing the pink color in the claws and hair to something else would probably help with the skin.\n\nI want to feel like this is a dangerous spirit coming after me, not have to look at it a few times, blinking mindlessly before asking \"what even are you?\"\n\n> Katarina\n> We aren't, but what stands out as the larger issue - the hair, the blades? What color scheme would you suggest/tweaks would you make on the existinf color scheme?\n\nIf I could only change the hair or the blades, I'd change the blades. They look too solid for what I assume are suppose to be some sort of spirit blade, so I'd probably try to increase the transparency on them first. The hair could work with the bright blue, but it feels drowned out by equally bright blades and arm. Once again, not liking the pink hues thrown in, it doesn't feel like it flows.\n\nSimilarly, I'd probably change her spirit arm to be closer to Viktor's 3rd arm, where you can tell it's there but it looks less tangible, and possibly add more spirit-like glows from other parts of her (bicep region on her left arm may be a good candidate, a bare spirit arm and a spirit arm with a gauntlet over it feels cool).","replies":[{"poster":"KnightsKemplar","date":"2017-10-12T20:50:47.655+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Indeed, I wasn't even able to recognize that she had a spirit arm until I read this comment.

That skin is just a mess in my opinion. There are too many edges and colours clashing with each other. The mask has too small details for them to be visible at all. I cannot see the face at all when viewing him at his natural angles. I can barely see it when he stands up to perform the recall animation. This is an issue for a lot of Zed skins: the mask/face is hard to see. You could add a new kind of helmet, or a more complete helmet instead. The hair does not add anything worth mentioning to the skin, so just drop it. Here is a small edit to show what I mean:\nhttps://i.imgur.com/rLrHZOM.png\n\n**New features:**\n\n- New helmet\n- Blue, glowing eyes\n- Hair removed\n\nI think Riot needs to reconsider how one approaches Zed skins, because all the details get lost because of the angle of his head. Just add some massive helmets, hoods or interesting details to get around the problem.","replies":[{"poster":"Xedxeed","date":"2018-06-14T12:10:01.373+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a zed main, I completely disliked the deathsworn zed skin, and I wouldn't even consider buying it, I know this is coming very late but oh well. However, with th changs yoy made, I would 100% buy that skin even just the way you made it without any thing else. Looks AWESOME! good job. I would also just staright up remove the swords and make them kind of more realistic shurikens, maybe something like Kamui shurikens from naruto kinda thing but idk, i just hate the shurikens. The E looks pretty descent, could use some color changes. R looks stupid straight up, swords?? really rito, just do anything about it, maybe have the same pattern as the new shurikens if you will make any. W color is interesting, not good nor bad, just intersting. Sound on W and R is just stupid, not scary, I mean sounds from bloodmoon jhin R, or jhin general theme are moe scary, so would definetaly make that different, maybe make zed R whispper some spells or something until it pops, for W i have no idea. His claws are just way too steeply curved which makes AA look very awkward except for passive AA, just change their colors and curve steepness. IDK, just my thoughts.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nefas","date":"2017-10-12T20:04:00.954+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Regarding Katarina - the fact that she is alive while Viktor is a ghostly shade is part of what makes it look like a recycled Neon Strike skin.

What's the draw of the 'gravelord' concept for the skin? Viktor's is cool because he has a magic necromancer staff and some kind of zombie appendage sticking out of his back where before it was a robot arm. I can't think of any kind of necromancer themed things to stick on a Katarina or Zed skin. They use physical, bladed weapons with no obvious connection to necromantic energies so I would just say those champions are not great fits for the skin line.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"JooshBox","date":"2017-10-12T00:33:45.655+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unpopular opinion but I really like Kat's skin and colour scheme probably the best of the bunch. Her hair color and movement make her look like a spectral wraith. I also like her animations the best, Viktor is second best for me and Zed fall pretty flat. Viktor's model is actually better than Kat, but the spell effects lack clarity and bring the skin down. Every ability is varying shades of the same light blue it actually looks really difficult to identify which ability is which. The Q is ok I guess a bit lackluster, the W is cool but I wish it was a different color maybe a dark purple or green. His E is fine I suppose but another light blue, which again is not bad but paired with his last ability the R it's blue on blue. His R is by far the best ability really cool sound visual and thematic 10/10. I play Viktor and Zed more than I do Kat but those are my opinions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Forhonor321","date":"2017-10-11T19:52:03.484+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Zed for the most part I feel can work, they just need to tweak some things like the claws to look better, cause I like the idea of that on this skin, and probably change the daggers back to shurikens. Hell, shift some of the colors around a bit maybe.\n\nKat on the other hand I don't feel fits at all with the look or feel of this theme. If anything I get more of, like you said, Death Blossom color scheme from her. The daggers look off, the hair, while they try to make it float, still looks a bit stiff and because she keeps her more human-like appearance it doesn't match with Zed or Viktor in this undead haunting spirit feel.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Silvarspark","date":"2017-10-11T20:29:37.523+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree that Victor's skin works best. It's the colors and the contrasts between light and darks. It's really well balanced.\nPlus Victor's skin has great design elements to show the shadow isle inspiration.\n\nZed's design is alright, even the claws, but his colors are a bit wonky, like the pink and the skin overall seems much brighter than Victor's. \nThat shouldnt be much of a problem to fix though.\n\nKata...yea, I agree this is rather bad. She's way too bright, the pink (again) doesnt really fit and while Zed's model is fine, you dont really have much to look at here. If you zoom in, you can see a bit of Shadow isle armor pieces, but they are very small and pretty much disappear in regular view.\nThat leaves us seemingly with a recolored Kata with glowing hair and blades. I guess it's somewhat inspired by a banshee. The ghostly aspect from the other two skins is dropped here. She even has regular skin instead of the green spectral one.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Variks the Loyal","date":"2017-10-11T18:16:54.019+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"I like Zed and Kat much more than Viktor's personally.\n\nFight me.","replies":[{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2017-10-11T18:24:28.616+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"OK, what do you like about them?

(not sure if i can submit now)\n\nKata needs to be a bit \"spookier\". More etheral, more ghostlike. Maybe have her face paler, just throw in some make up ? I made a quick drawing to try make her more creepy/halloween like. If i'm allowed to share it i'd be happy to send it !\n\nAs for Zed, the most ...annoying are really his weapons. I just noticed the blades on his back are the same as Kata so i guess there is a story; but by the end, Q spell looks so goofy with a knife. Keeping the shurikens was really the best choice. Same for the claws, no idea why he has claws and it really make it awkward and clunky with his model.\nI know you guys said you can't change the weapons at this point, but i feel like people would really be more forgiving with these skins if he had keep his original weapons... Isn't it possible to copy and paste weapons from another skin ? :o\n\nThen, some minor esthetic choices i noticed on Zed.\nOverall he could use a more ...Impressive appearence. He doesn't nearly look as threathening as a master of shadows using ghost could be.\nLike, he need to feel overall like that spirit coming from the undead world reading to rip you out, right ? But rn with that armor he looks like he's too poor to afford  a full outfit. \nI think it could help a lot to just... Give him more armor. The midriff showing make absolutely no sense and looks super weird on Zed. It takes of his scary factor. So i'd say, if you guys could cover Zed a little more, especially that exposed stomach, i'd be more than thankful.\nAnother point i noted with him is how skinny he looks, compared to usual, but also his legs...don't fit with his upper body. \nHis legs are super frail and weak looking. I'd say, maybe bulk him up a little ? Or give him boots instead ? Just plain black knee boots could really work better than that...weird shoes + sorta black stocking ensemble.\nAlso perhaps make his mask more covering of his \"face\".\nI don't think you could add him something majestic like a cape but one can dream :D\n\nAnd finally (may works for Kata too) less blue. the blue here is too bright, so bright they look like Neon Unit and no spirits. Spirits are etheral, almost fading. I think it would gladly help to tone down the violent blue to something more soft, almost cloudy.  Basically, more Kalista than Neon Strike Vi. \n\nJust darkening the colors and toning down the brightness may be an exellent change to consider.\n\nWhat i'm suggesting is super minor because i know you guys can't change really big points, but i think stuff like adding more armor can be discussed right ?\n\nI may have spit on these skins quite a lot, but i frankly believe they can be saved (i may be biased because i'm a huge fan of Viktor and Zed and i like Kata too) so it be really sad to not change them and let them go live like this, especially since the community really has trouble accepting them to the point of wanting them scrapped :/\nSo i'll try to be more constructive and help a bit ! If my suggestions can make a difference.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LostFr0st","date":"2017-10-12T19:22:27.256+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the Viktor one is really nice.\nIt's sharp and even at a quick glance the skin has a good overall read.\nThe colours and tones have good contrast and pop.\n-----------------------------\nThe Zed one looks strange when he's autoing.\nSure, curved claws are new! great!  But any animation other than when the passive is procced (slash) looks kinda awkward due to the steepness of the curve.\n\nIn addition, the colour palette is too tightly related within the skin so it tends to blend instead of popping like Viktor's does.\n\nPossibilities to explore:\n1) I _think_ the opening on Zed's head glow is too big, resulting in a blinding effect which mutes the contrast on the rest of the skin.\nDoing so would also stop the head from blending into the back as much.\n---------------\nAs for Katarina, the spectral arm or w/e is hurting the cohesion when I look at it.\nSo first glance the player is like \"Oh, she's in costume\" and then we start looking more closely and you get \"Wait... what's wrong with her arm?  No... but her body and face are skin... HMMM...\"\n\nPossibilities to explore:\n1) Put another tone in Kat's hair near her face to get some contrast.\nBright teal beside skin tone is too hard to read.\n2) Spectral hand either need a way better read or needs to go.\nIt looks strange since it doesn't match her chest and face.\nIn addition, it blends in too strongly with her hair and the 'daggers' which stops the hair and 'daggers' from really popping when the overall skin is looked at.\n3) Sharpen the armor colours/contrast.\nMaybe just pushing the different grey tones apart like Viktor's would do it.","replies":[]}]}
