All the newspapers talk about his mummy-rags-to-riches success, he has to wear sunglasses to protect his eyes from the flashes of the ever present paparazzi, and everyone&#039;s flattered that he&#039;d take the time to spend more time with him (via ultimate and bandage toss).\r\n\r\nOne of the biggest challenges for a skin like this is that every animation has to change:\r\n\r\n* His walk can&#039;t be this timid little waddle, it has to have more flair to it than that. Maybe throw in a happy little dance move every once in a while, like a little side step slide.\r\n* His bandage toss can&#039;t look like a desperate attempt to get close to someone, it has to be more of a one handed affectionate gesture. I&#039;m imagining a gesture similar to how you&#039;d wrap your arm around the waist of your date, or clasp a good friend&#039;s shoulder as you wrap your arm around them.\r\n* Despair is hard to figure out. Music related pulses makes for a good visual AoE, but doesn&#039;t fit very well with the generic &quot;popular&quot; theme and feels more like a pop-star.\r\n* Tantrum&#039;s already basically a break-dance move, just make it look like he&#039;s doing it intentionally and ramp up the style points.\r\n* I think Curse of the Sad Mummy should have some sort of play off of a paparazzi, with camera flashes everywhere, but I&#039;m not quite sure where to go with it beyond that.\r\n\r\nAnyway, curious what you guys think about the idea.","replies":[{"poster":"Kilo of Koz","date":"2015-07-17T19:29:33.838+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a really good concept, but it might destroy his character's personality.","replies":[{"poster":"IcyPepper","date":"2015-07-17T19:37:50.549+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":0,"body":"Skins are allowed to explore different aspects of a character.
