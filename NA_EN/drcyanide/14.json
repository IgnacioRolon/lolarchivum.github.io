It&#039;d give him a skin that&#039;s very different from his existing lineup, would fit nicely into the Project line, and would be unlikely to have readability issues.","replies":[{"poster":"SirM0rgan","date":"2016-09-13T18:23:45.590+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That would be awesome.  That or a dark star/void xerath.  He would look pretty sweet with black/purple effects, like something similar to Syndra's particle effects.  Or you could do bloodstone xerath with dark red and black particle effects.  Even if it were ridiculously overpriced, I'd buy any of these.  Even if it was just a chroma pack for one of his existing skins.","replies":[]}]}
