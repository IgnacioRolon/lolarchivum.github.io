Each game would count for 10-20 other games played at an above average level.\n\nAs one studying complexity theory at the graduate level, I would have to point out that the situation itself is actually a bit more tricky than it might seem.  The \"butterfly effect\" of the Xerath bug had a trickle-over effect for more than just the Xerath player accounts - the exploiters' other accounts where their IP might have been transferred; their champions; the players involved in those games on the same side as the Xeraths; their opponents; and so on.\n\nIt's a huge intertwined mess.  The simplistic approach is to get rid of just those games.  But then that ignores the ratings affected by the players (I know that a couple of streamers were in games where they were in their Promos when it happened); then there's the IP earned and the possible stuff purchased and transferred to other accounts.  I don't envy Riot's decision here - especially given how long the exploit was out there.","replies":[]},{"poster":"137434","date":"2017-04-13T20:17:49.858+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"5% pick rate may not seem like very much, but remember that is 5% of every. single. game. played on the server, and not everyone playing Xerath right now is using the exploit. We are still talking about a huge number of total Xerath games that the exploited games have to be filtered through.\n\nWe don't know the algorithm that Riot uses to judge scores. While it compares an exploited game against the current \"good\" scores and give a grade, there may be systems in place that detects extreme outliers (i.e., KDA over 20x greater than average good) and prevent those outliers from being averaged into the \"good\" score already.
