In game however, Rengar often finds it safer to repeatedly kill his weakest enemies. We like the snowballing hunt mechanic that the Bonetooth Necklace provides, but ***we want it to incentivize Rengar to seek out increasingly dangerous foes***, not that poor Nami again and again (even if cats do love fish).\n\nWe&#039;ve heard wording very similar to that before, when Riot has describes why Fiora has % Health True Damage. They say she has it so she&#039;s not afraid to challenge anyone, tank or squishy. Currently, Rengar has no reason to challenge Tanks, and no tools to do so. If they want him to attack more dangerous foes (dangerous to his success) then they&#039;re going to need to give him *something* to take on Tanks. \n\nI could see something similar to Garen&#039;s Villian system too, giving % Missing Health True Damage to a changing target, but you&#039;re still looking at some form of % Health True Damage.\n\n... please be nice kitty... {{champion:107}}","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2016-10-11T03:01:38.290+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"At present none of the assassin kits being worked on have had any true damage added to them.

From what Riot was saying, I would assume that they will link is passive to a villain mechanic kinda like Garen has. Instead of him going after the poor, useless squishy or the same target over and over again, they'd want him to kill the dangerous foe, being the one who's most fed. I'm thinking something like Garen's passive or something like Kindred, except you don't have control over who you mark.\n\nJust some speculations I have, but I can almost guarantee they aren't putting %HP True Damage on him.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ast√¥lfo","date":"2016-10-11T00:34:12.197+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Some sort of bonus against the current enemy champion with the highest K+A score (K + (0.5 x A)) would be cool.","replies":[{"poster":"GULAG 4 U","date":"2016-10-11T00:41:35.558+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So garen 2.0 in one way?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kyrrion","date":"2016-10-11T00:21:19.715+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I figured Rengar may play around the bounty system instead.  Make the hunter cat a bounty hunter cat.\n\nThe issue with % max health true damage is that it's a \"kill anyone in X seconds\" mechanic, not a \"here's a bigger reward for going after a riskier target\" mechanic.  That 2/0 Syndra isn't stacking armor past a Zhonya's afterall and her health buys are likely minimal in comparison to tanky champions.\n\nIf nothing else,  it'll be like you said with the Villain mechanic.  I still think the bounty system interaction would be pretty cool though.","replies":[{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2016-10-11T00:28:16.011+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I could easily see him having a part of the Bone Tooth Necklace passive which requires him hunting down new targets for a perk, or having him cycle through the entire enemy team to get a bigger perk. He's going to need a way to actually take down anyone on the other team for that though, which I think is where the % Health damage would come from.","replies":[{"poster":"Kyrrion","date":"2016-10-11T00:37:52.299+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If Riot needs to shove % health damage on everyone, there's a bigger issue in the game.\n\nHe has an entire kit where damage can be added on to.  Adding % health is only going to make Rengar build tank again.","replies":[{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2016-10-11T00:47:19.664+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think they might be OK with that as a fall back plan. Part of their initial statement was they don't like how bad it feels to play as/with an assassin that's behind and useless. True damage would keep him from falling impossibly far behind, always keeping him somewhat relevant. \n\nAlternatively, they could use a different mechanic to keep him relevant, similar to Rek'sai's buried vision helping the team out even when not actively on the front line. Maybe adapt his Ult vision for his team when he's in a bush or some such.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Abyssphere","date":"2016-10-11T00:43:24.731+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Increasingly dangerous foes aligns better with enemies that are doing more damage rather than tanky enemies, so if they were going to make him better at fighting anyone it'd be powerful squishies rather than tanks. That said, there's no indication at all that this change will be about making him better at fighting tough enemies, but rather making him want to fight tough enemies more. To look at the example they used, Rengar is probably more than capable of fighting the mid lane Orianna or the ADC Draven. However, he keeps going for Nami because she's underlevelled and even in the worst case scenario there's no chance at all of her killing him. This is the sort of situation they want to address - they want to make him hunt after the Orianna or Draven in this scenario.\n\nThe most likely mechanic at this stage is his necklace rewarding killing different enemies or a mechanic similar to Kindred/Garen where he can either choose an enemy to hunt (and can't repeatedly pick the same one, like Kindred) or he's told who he should be hunting depending on who has the most kills, like Garen.","replies":[]}]}
