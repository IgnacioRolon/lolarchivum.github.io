The notice text runs off the screen. \n2. Responses don&#039;t show up. At the time of this screenshot I didn&#039;t have any notices, but I got one since then and it didn&#039;t show up\n\nAdditionally, the text when you click on your name doesn&#039;t match what you expect. &quot;Boards Profile&quot; has the text &quot;Change your look&quot;, despite the page having no options to customize look.\n\nEDIT: Looks like there are some other display issues with smaller screens (like my netbook). It loaded the top version, then the second, then the third, before settling on the fourth (which looks worse than the third).\nhttp://i.imgur.com/XAeTnbw.png\n","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Goosetown","date":"2016-11-08T02:03:04.710+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, thanks for taking the time to leave feedback.

If you then click on the smaller Blue !'s in the popup, it toggles back to white, despite the message still being down. You can then click on the main Blue ! and it'll close the message area, but toggle back to being black.\n\n... can you tell I spent some time in QA?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Catzpaw","date":"2016-11-08T02:21:42.117+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"yep!
