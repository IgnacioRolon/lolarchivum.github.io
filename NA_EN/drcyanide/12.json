I&#039;ve seen this story come up a few times, maybe you&#039;ve seen it too.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nA player gets a chat restriction and thinks nothing of it. They may recall a few games where they were extra out of line, admit they were wrong, and move on.\r\n\r\nThen they get another chat restriction. Again, a few of their worse games come to mind, but they think to themselves &quot;I&#039;ve had this punishment before, it&#039;s not so bad.&quot; \r\n\r\nThen comes the 2-week ban with its warning that the next punishment is a permanent ban. It&#039;s at this point that the player realizes they *really* need to change. While there are those that don&#039;t try to improve, there are also those that give it their all. \r\n\r\nThey go two months or so without incident, but then it hits them. The bad day combined with the boosted Bronze 5 teammates who provoke them. They&#039;ve handled situations like this since their two week ban, but today the old habits raise their ugly head and they lash out. They realize their mistake soon after the game, but it&#039;s too late. They&#039;re now permabanned.\r\n\r\nUsually when this player comes to the boards they don&#039;t post about how Riot was wrong, nor do they beg for another chance. They&#039;d love another chance, sure, but what you notice most is the sadness of the post. They were so close to being counted as honestly, truly, completely reformed, and it slipped away from them. If only they&#039;d had more time to try and get it right...\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\nIt&#039;s for that player that I think the punishment system needs to be changed. I believe that these players can and would have been able to turn their actions around *had they started trying sooner*. I feel like the best way to get across that they need to change sooner is to have the punishments themselves ramp up sooner, with the exception of the permaban itself.\r\n\r\nImagine if after the 10 game chat restriction you got a 2 week ban. You&#039;d take that pretty seriously, even if there were still punishments after it. I think that might be the best catalyst for players changing, is being kicked from the game for a while. \r\n\r\nWith that in mind, I think that the punishment system which might help players start reforming sooner would look something like this:\r\n\r\n* 25 game chat restriction\r\n * You can go a lot of games without needing to talk much. This punishment should be geared towards getting players use to that, even if they&#039;re frustrated with their teammates. I&#039;m not sure 10 games with limited chat is enough to get that across\r\n* 2 week ban\r\n * This is where the punishment system gets real for most. It&#039;s at this step that people try to change, but it may take a bit of practice to get into a habit of responding appropriately, which is why I don&#039;t think it should be right up against Permaban. I&#039;d also be in favor of keeping 10 game chat restriction and adding a step after 2 week ban.\r\n* 4 week ban\r\n * Roughly a month of no League. It&#039;s about as long as a temp ban can possibly be. There&#039;s a decent chance players would make smurf accounts at this point, so it&#039;s not an ideal punishment by any means.\r\n* Permaban\r\n\r\n\r\nI really think this would help people change sooner, but I&#039;m curious what you think. *Particularly* if you&#039;ve been through the current punishment system before, do you think you&#039;d respond better or worse to this system?","replies":[{"poster":"Krigjer","date":"2016-11-03T23:02:50.967+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"I feel like it should escalate from chat restrictions to 24-hour bans, then 48-hour or whatever is appropriate. \nBeing hit with a 2-week ban after just not being allowed to talk in a game feels like a harsh step up.\n\nI would wager that a majority of people try to reform at the first sign of actual punishment. \nWe're like children- getting grounded for a day made it clear that they mean business but care enough about us actually behaving to give us a second chance.

If the behavior improves, the punishment should reflect that. If the behavior remains constant, then that player should continue to receive the same degree of punishment. Obviously if signs of reform don't appear after a significantly long duration, then perhaps an escalation is warranted. \n\nThis is why having such a black and white justice system is pure cancer. Look at our legal system: we have a jury that determines guilt based on ALL EVIDENCE PRESENT, and a judge that determines sentencing based on a multitude of factors, not just how many times the defendant was convicted previously. But this is the thing that Riot utterly refuses to comprehend: CONTEXT. The context of a report is so critical in determining what is going on. That's why they used to have the Tribunal, so that peers could review the ENTIRE chat log of a game and determine whether or not the reported player really did something worthy of punishment. Now, there is a bot that scans through the chat log of the reported player (with all other chat absent from the log) to search for key words/phrases identified as \"toxic\". This is borderline unethical, and it really needs to stop. No other game does this, and for good reason: Riot has sufficiently created a fear of using the in-game chat function based on the fact that if you say anything \"out of line\" someone will report it, and you will get banned. \n\nLeague players need to grow up a bit. Sure, report racism and sexism and all that hate speech shit, that needs to go, but when someone gives you criticism or tells you that you're feeding, either that person is right and you are creating a negative experience for your team (whether intentionally or not is irrelevant, feeding causes negativity), or that person is tilted and you should just ignore them (perhaps mute them) and move on.

The fact that Riot didn't make an official one was simply out of their unwillingness to cater to the desires of the community. \n\nAs for the Tribunal, however, I sincerely believe it's gone for good.

These would be the players who spend a lot on the game and are legitimately worried about losing their account. However, like you said, people are quick to just create a new account, so things probably wouldn't change much in the grand scheme of things. We would just end up with a lot more accounts on temporary suspensions instead of permanent ones in your proposed solution.\n\nThe ideal solution to the problem as whole in my eyes is to restrict account creation so that people cannot create a theoretically infinite number of throwaway accounts. I have no idea how Riot might implement that, but without it people can always come back regardless of the punishment systems in place, as long as they don't mind leveling a new account (or buying one I suppose).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Maximum Morde","date":"2016-11-03T22:40:09.874+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"No. The people who get perma banned are the kind of people who don't understand that their actions are wrong.

The Romans had the same idea, make the punishment far scarier, and crimes will go down. These punishments include things like crucifixion which is considered one of the worst ways to die.\n\nDid it work? According to historians not at all. Not only the public display of the people suffering during their punishment but the lingering of the body afterwards as an attempt to sway any trouble seekers did almost nothing to the crime rates.\n\nIn the same venue increasing punishment will only make people have harsher punishments, it will do little if nothing to the actual rate of punishment. I'm not against it, I am just saying history proves your point invalid.","replies":[{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2016-11-04T23:38:51.661+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As I've pointed out before, historical examples of justice systems aren't the most applicable here. Most (including your own Roman example) rely on the assumption that people will be aware of the punishment affixed to the crime, attempting to use it as a deterrent. The punishment in those cases is used to make an example of the guilty.\n\nIn League, we have neither a widely publicized list of punishments, nor is the general public aware of ways to view the suffering of those who were punished. As such, the \"threat\" methods used by the Romans and other governments is meaningless. \n\nIn League people are notified of the law when they break it (or when they dig through the legalese of the ToS). It's kinda like driving on a stretch of open road with no speed limit sign. You see cars driving super slow, others zooming by and zipping in and out of lanes. If you're driving too fast, you get two warnings, but no indicator of how much above the speed limit you're going. You have hard time judging how far over you might be, as from your perspective you're not the fastest car but you're not the slowest either. You slow down after each time you've been pulled over, but you still get pulled over. The cop doesn't tell you the limit, only listing off how fast you've been driving recently. The third time you're pulled over you're given a ticket and told if you speed again your car will be impounded, right there on the spot. You slowed down when you got the warnings, but you slow *way* down after you get that ticket.\n\nThe comparison isn't perfect, but I think it's decent. I think a \"ticket\" earlier, or at least earlier warnings that a permaban is up ahead, would get people to make bigger steps in changing their behavior sooner, rather than trying to do it all at crunch time.","replies":[]}]}]}
