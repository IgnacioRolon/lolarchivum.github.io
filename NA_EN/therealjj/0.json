The next set of picks someone takes {{champion:69}}, and we were purple side. The last pick was planning on going ADC, but because we had someone appearing to force their way into mid they say, \"Ez you go bot and I will support you\" to which his response was \"No I called mid and I'm going Mid, she can support\". \r\n\r\nOver the course of the game Ez does well but DC's, along with 2 others, and the game quickly spirals out of control. It was argued that if Ez had gone bot and had let the stupid person that picked Cass mid there would have been a better chance of making a comeback and winning. Which is I feel is true. I am in no way trying to condone Cass' behavior but I feel you have not be able to adapt when people aren't going to follow the etiquette of the game. \r\n\r\nI know if we always give in to the trolls it could spiral out of control, but she had forced her way in and Ez ended up going AD so the major difference would have been the lane he played in. I think Cass was 100% in the wrong and I want people like that to be punished someway, but Ez could have made the situation a mild irritant instead of a trolling event. What are your opinions on the matter?\r\n\r\nThe quotes aren't exact, but they paraphrase the conversation.","replies":[]}
