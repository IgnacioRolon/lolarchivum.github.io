That's what painting is all about. It should make you feel good when you paint. That's a crooked tree. We'll send him to Washington. You're meant to have fun in life. We don't have to be committed. We are just playing here. With practice comes confidence. Just beat the devil out of it. We don't have to be concerned about it. We just have to let it fall where it will. There are no mistakes. You can fix anything that happens. Be careful. You can always add more - but you can't take it away. We must be quiet, soft and gentle.\n\nYou can do anything here - the only pre-requisite is that it makes you happy. This present moment is perfect simply due to the fact you're experiencing it. Every single thing in the world has its own personality - and it is up to you to make friends with the little rascals. Just relax and let it flow. That easy. If what you're doing doesn't make you happy - you're doing the wrong thing. We don't make mistakes we just have happy little accidents. Everything is happy if you choose to make it that way. Everyone wants to enjoy the good parts - but you have to build the framework first. You can't have light without dark. You can't know happiness unless you've known sorrow. Just make a decision and let it go.\n\nIn this world, everything can be happy. God gave you this gift of imagination. Use it. Sometimes you learn more from your mistakes than you do from your masterpieces. You're the greatest thing that has ever been or ever will be. You're special. You're so very special. You can do anything your heart can imagine. Don't be afraid to make these big decisions. Once you start, they sort of just make themselves.\n\nIf you don't like it - change it. It's your world. Water's like me. It's laaazyÂ ... Boy, it always looks for the easiest way to do things This is your world, whatever makes you happy you can put in it. Go crazy. We want to use a lot pressure while using no pressure at all. Go out on a limb - that's where the fruit is. The first step to doing anything is to believe you can do it. See it finished in your mind before you ever start. Don't forget to tell these special people in your life just how special they are to you. Almost everything is going to happen for you automatically - you don't have to spend any time working or worrying. You have to make almighty decisions when you're the creator. That is when you can experience true joy, when you have no fear.\n\nJust pretend you are a whisper floating across a mountain. A thin paint will stick to a thick paint. You can create the world you want to see and be a part of. You have that power. Don't hurry. Take your time and enjoy. I really believe that if you practice enough you could paint the 'Mona Lisa' with a two-inch brush. We're not trying to teach you a thing to copy. We're just here to teach you a technique, then let you loose into the world. In nature, dead trees are just as normal as live trees. It's amazing what you can do with a little love in your heart.\n\nNo worries. No cares. Just float and wait for the wind to blow you around. Everybody's different. Trees are different. Let them all be individuals. Just let go - and fall like a little waterfall. They say everything looks better with odd numbers of things. But sometimes I put even numbersâjust to upset the critics. Even trees need a friend. We all need friends. Talent is a pursued interest. That is to say, anything you practice you can do.\n\nJust let your mind wander and enjoy. This should make you happy. A tree cannot be straight if it has a crooked trunk. These things happen automatically. All you have to do is just let them happen. Let all these little things happen. Don't fight them. Learn to use them. This is an example of what you can do with just a few things, a little imagination and a happy dream in your heart.\n\nLa- da- da- da- dah. Just be happy. Even the worst thing we can do here is good. You can do anything here. So don't worry about it. From all of us here, I want to wish you happy painting and God bless, my friends. Let's get crazy. Pretend you're water. Just floating without any effort. Having a good day. Just take out whatever you don't want. It'll change your entire perspective. In life you need colors. If you do too much it's going to lose its effectiveness. We'll paint one happy little tree right here. It's beautiful - and we haven't even done anything to it yet. If there are two big trees, eventually there will be a little tree.\n\nYou've got to learn to fight the temptation to resist these things. Just let them happen. The light is your friend. Preserve it. Just go out and talk to a tree. Make friends with it. Any little thing can be your friend if you let it be. Paint anything you want on the canvas. Create your own world. I sincerely wish for you every possible joy life could bring. In your world you have total and absolute power. That's why I paint - because I can create the kind of world I want - and I can make this world as happy as I want it. I like to beat the brush.\n\nIt's a super day, so why not make a beautiful sky? Work on one thing at a time. Don't get carried away - we have plenty of time. It's life. It's interesting. It's fun. If you don't think every day is a good day - try missing a few. You'll see. Trees grow however makes them happy. Exercising the imagination, experimenting with talents, being creative; these things, to me, are truly the windows to your soul. But we're not there yet, so we don't need to worry about it. It's hard to see things when you're too close. Take a step back and look. There are no limits in this world. There isn't a rule. You just practice and find out which way works best for you. You can create anything that makes you happy. Be so very light. Be a gentle whisper.\n\nThe least little bit can do so much. We spend so much of our life looking - but never seeing. All you have to learn here is how to have fun. When you do it your way you can go anywhere you choose. You can create beautiful things - but you have to see them in your mind first Don't kill all your dark areas - you need them to show the light. If it's not what you want - stop and change it. Don't just keep going and expect it will get better. Put light against light - you have nothing. Put dark against dark - you have nothing. It's the contrast of light and dark that each give the other one meaning. We don't really know where this goes - and I'm not sure we really care. You have freedom here. The only guide is your heart.\n\nYou can't make a mistake. Anything that happens you can learn to use - and make something beautiful out of it. Anytime you learn something your time and energy are not wasted. Everyone is going to see things differently - and that's the way it should be. Isn't it fantastic that you can change your mind and create all these happy things? Let's make some happy little clouds in our world The man who does the best job is the one who is happy at his job. You have to allow the paint to break to make it beautiful. Only think about one thing at a time. Don't get greedy. We artists are a different breed of people. We're a happy bunch.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MadoScientist","date":"2015-11-11T11:19:57.317+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Needs to be a legendary skin, where the painting becomes more complete with levels or assists or something.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CarterCarnage","date":"2015-11-10T22:31:28.315+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd love to have this! \n\nBut RIOT, don't forget about that Bruce Swain skin that someone made up >_>","replies":[]},{"poster":"I am Hated","date":"2015-11-10T20:25:43.698+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ruined!","replies":[]},{"poster":"VikÃ­ng","date":"2015-11-10T20:11:03.496+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh my fucking god yes please.","replies":[]}]}
