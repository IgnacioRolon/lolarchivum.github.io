Now, the game tells me that both are inactive. I wish to test out the assassin reworks, and I know it hasn't been more than 6 months since I've played a match on the PBE. I've been seeing some posts about an opt-in for the PBE... but I was one of the original approved testers. The accounts are not linked to any live account, as that was not a condition beforehand.","replies":[{"poster":"baris na english","date":"2016-10-20T09:06:34.843+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wasn't Connect PBE!!!!!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-19T16:28:18.392+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wasn't able to locate a PBE account from the account you are posting from, so I can't verify if you already have a PBE account activated or not.
