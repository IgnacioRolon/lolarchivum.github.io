Please do not suggest something like \"port forwarding\" or helpfully suggest \"it seems you may have some apps like Skype or Spotify open.\" I've tried anything and everything on Riot's common troubleshooting page. **\r\n\r\nMy internet is well above what is necessary for League and my Net Analyzer results are green across the board. However, I get ping spikes of 500 ms or higher every few seconds in games (roughly every minute) which seem to happen with increasing frequency as more data is being sent. I have taken the following steps. Please assume that I have done these in suicides, meaning that if I did something in step 1, I will have tried it in step 6 also (and not tried it).\r\n\r\n1. Ping tests, done on the guidance of Rioters after submitting tickets, indicated that it may have been an ISP issue, specifically at the first hop. Here's a WinMTR from that:\r\n\r\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\r\n\r\n|                                      WinMTR statistics                                   |\r\n\r\n|                       Host              -   %  | Sent | Recv | Best | Avrg | Wrst | Last |\r\n\r\n|------------------------------------------------|------|------|------|------|------|------|\r\n\r\n|                             192.168.1.1 -    0 |  805 |  805 |    0 |    3 |  173 |    0 |\r\n\r\n|lo0-100.NYCMNY-VFTTP-343.verizon-gni.net -    0 |  802 |  802 |    0 |   35 | 2019 |    2 |\r\n\r\n|     B3343.NYCMNY-LCR-21.verizon-gni.net -    0 |  802 |  802 |    2 |   37 | 2019 |    7 |\r\n\r\n|                   No response from host -  100 |  162 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |\r\n\r\n|              0.ae11.GW14.NYC1.ALTER.NET -    0 |  802 |  802 |    2 |   36 | 2017 |    3 |\r\n\r\n|                           204.148.68.38 -    0 |  802 |  802 |    2 |   35 | 2016 |    3 |\r\n\r\n|                          104.160.132.35 -    0 |  802 |  802 |    3 |   36 | 2017 |    6 |\r\n\r\n|          ae31-br01.chi01.riotdirect.net -    0 |  802 |  802 |   19 |   50 | 2016 |   20 |\r\n\r\n|                           104.160.131.1 -    0 |  802 |  802 |   18 |   50 | 2016 |   19 |\r\n\r\n|________________________________________________|______|______|______|______|______|______|\r\n\r\n It seems like there's a huge jump at the first verizon node. I spoke to Verizon. Extensively. They cannot replicate this ping loss, which happens to me every game. And they tried, really really hard. I was talking to engineers who were sending pings, excessive amounts. I sighed and just assumed League was not for me anymore.\r\n\r\n2. I tried downloading League on my mac to see how that went. It went perfectly. There were absolutely no issues at all. This is over the same network in the same location. This lets me confirm that my ISP was right, and the problem is not with my internet.\r\n\r\n3. I try lugging my desktop to my living room; my roommates were thrilled. I had the following ping test while doing so:\r\n\r\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\r\n\r\n|                                      WinMTR statistics                                   |\r\n\r\n|                       Host              -   %  | Sent | Recv | Best | Avrg | Wrst | Last |\r\n\r\n|------------------------------------------------|------|------|------|------|------|------|\r\n\r\n|lo0-100.NYCMNY-VFTTP-343.verizon-gni.net -    0 |  733 |  733 |    0 |    2 |   62 |    1 |\r\n\r\n|     B3343.NYCMNY-LCR-21.verizon-gni.net -    0 |  733 |  733 |    1 |    4 |   24 |    3 |\r\n\r\n|                   No response from host -  100 |  147 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |\r\n\r\n|              0.ae11.GW14.NYC1.ALTER.NET -    0 |  733 |  733 |    2 |    3 |   40 |   21 |\r\n\r\n|                           204.148.68.38 -    0 |  733 |  733 |    2 |    3 |   16 |    4 |\r\n\r\n|                          104.160.132.35 -    0 |  733 |  733 |    3 |    4 |   18 |    4 |\r\n\r\n|          ae31-br01.chi01.riotdirect.net -    0 |  733 |  733 |   18 |   19 |   81 |   20 |\r\n\r\n|                           104.160.131.1 -    0 |  733 |  733 |   18 |   19 |   24 |   20 |\r\n\r\n|________________________________________________|______|______|______|______|______|______|\r\n\r\nSeems all good. So the issue is with the Wifi and specifically with its connection to me.\r\n\r\n4. I get Verizon to switch out my router. They do. I reset it up and get that hilarious Router name lyfe going on; everyone in my apartment building loves me now for my wireless wit. I run a ping test on my Windows, hoping desperately for salvation. The ping test looks identical to the original test (I will not copy and paste for the sake of reducing this already long post).\r\n\r\n5. Since my laptop (wirelessly) is connecting to League fine and I am connecting to League fine when I'm wired on my PC, the problem must be my own PC's connection to my Router. \r\n\r\n6. I do everything imaginable. Port forwarding, safe reboots, deleting firewalls, changing DNS, I keep every program closed which could possibly use the internet. \r\n\r\n7. My wifi card is a TP Link 4800 (or something like that); it technically is not for Windows 10. However, it connects to literally everything else on the Internet perfectly, and I played hundreds of LoL games last year on it. I doubt it's the Wifi card failing, therefore.\r\n\r\n8. And here I am. Not sure what to do. I have obviously submitted a ticket and have been talking to Rioters about it, but it's slow going since we send a reply once a day or so. \r\n\r\nAnyone out there experienced something like this before? I would love some help.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-03-02T02:59:49.659+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I took a look at your ticket and it looks like it's still open and you're assigned with one of our tech specialists.
