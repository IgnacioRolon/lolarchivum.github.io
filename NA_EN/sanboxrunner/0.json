I have tried three different routers and three different WiFi cards, and two different modems; the problem is definitely isolated to just over wifi (fine over Ethernet), and, I believe, just to my computer. What's up?\r\n\r\n(For the record, Riot support has been very helpful, and last we spoke was when we thought I might either have a bad wifi card or a burned out pcie slot. As you'll see, since I've replaced the motherboard and wifi card since then, it ain't that).\r\n\r\nMore detail: I have done all the port forwarding, etc., that you might expect, but it has not helped in the least. I get the problem on my computer in a variety of games now (basically, also in Overwatch).\r\n\r\nI have tried three different Verizon routers (and corresponding ethernet cables) and two different Modems, and all with the same problem. I have additionally (coincidentally--I'm not pouring money into this) upgraded my computer's motherboard, wifi card, ram, and CPU while this problem was ongoing. Tests before those upgrades and after them are still the same.\r\n\r\nSince ethernet tests go great, the problem must be with the router or with the connection between the router and the modem. Having replaced all of them, it seems difficult for me to believe that they ALL had some defect. It seems to me either:\r\n\r\n    My computer is sending data over wifi to my router which confuses it.\r\n    Verizon G1100 (Quantum Gateway, or whatever silly name it has) routers just blow at video games and somehow just started sucking within the last month, having been perfect up till then.\r\n\r\nFor the record, I do all these tests with no other programs, hidden or otherwise, running. So it's not that issue. Also, my harddrives appear to be stable.\r\n\r\nCheers buds, I appreciate the help.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-03-20T03:23:23.094+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since you've done so much troubleshooting on your own already, I'd like to first see if I can get a clear picture of what your lag/packet loss looks like.
