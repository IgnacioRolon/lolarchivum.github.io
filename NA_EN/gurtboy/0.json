If you're not pushing, you're not at any risk of being ganked, and thus don't need to ward if your trinket is on cooldown. Nobody is going to gank you under turret at full health, below level 6, and even with ults it'd still be risky. \n\nNevertheless you should always be fighting for vision control of the lane, although this is easier to do while ahead of your laner. This isn't something only Supports do. Buy a control ward.
