I've tried this with both the new client and the legacy, they both just return with \"Failure to Authenticate.\" I asked a friend of mine to try and log onto my account for me and they got on just fine but when I tried I just keep getting the same issue. I have run through the hextech repair tool and connection issues on the tech support page and reinstalled. Still no dice.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-03-30T23:17:03.795+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since you're seeing the \"failure to authenticate\" message and your friend was able to log onto your account on their end, this is most likely some kind of weird issue between your network and our servers.
