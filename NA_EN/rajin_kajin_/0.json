It barely holds 60 fps at the lowest graphics settings. For some reason, though, Swain drops my fps like crazy. It&#039;s like his character model is fully tessellated. It&#039;s super detailed, his cape is super fluid. My pc literally cannot handle it. I know that&#039;s &quot;my fault&quot; and all, but I cannot be the only person experiencing this. Riot always talks about how they try to support older pc&#039;s. Zoe&#039;s a new champ and she doesn&#039;t have that problem. Maybe they just forgot to scale back his model on low settings? Idk. All I know is I just lost the hell out of a ranked game because swain dropped my fps from 60 to 15-20 simply by walking into frame. I know it&#039;s him, because my pc never has this problem, and because I have my full usual frame rate unless he&#039;s on screen. My frames honestly don&#039;t drop that bad in a five v five teamfight during baron. Like I said, I&#039;m on the lowest possible graphics settings, and my pc can manage 10 or 15 frames on high. Do you guys have any idea what&#039;s wrong? Riot, are you listening? Is this the new norm, are all new champs going to be like this now, or is it just a bug?\n\n1) Play on a low spec pc. (I guess, idk if higher end stations have this problem)\n\n2) Play against swain. (Idk if the summoner controlling swain experiences the lag, or if his team does)\n\n3) Have swain walk into your frame. \n\n4) Lose the game because you drop fps for no reason.
