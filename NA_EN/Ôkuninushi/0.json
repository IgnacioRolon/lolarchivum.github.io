It&#039;ll refuse to let me log in saying I can&#039;t connect to Authorization servers, or it&#039;ll straight up freeze in champ select I&#039;ve uninstalled and reinstalled i&#039;ve used the repair tool and followed anything I can on the Riot support site. And nothing has changed. My internet connection is fine I can listen to music load youtube videos at 720p or higher and play other games and browse the internet just fine. I have no idea what is going on and I&#039;d like some kind of help or at least some kind of idea on what I could do. I&#039;ve never had this issue before so it&#039;s really bothering me, because I&#039;ve lost LP a couple times because of this happening in champ select. [](https://imgur.com/gallery/3b8n74M) The screen was froze like this on champ select for about 5 minutes at 0 seconds left for my teams pick but everything else was running smoothly.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-05-10T02:50:51.907+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Helps if you list system information, if something is not a well-known issue.","replies":[]}]}
