Today when I got from work, I've been trying to play it, but my ping spiked to 600 every 10 seconds. It becomes stable for some time, and then in a middle of a fight (of course), it jumps back to 500-600 and I get \"Attempting to reconnect\" popup just to find myself dead 5 seconds after. It's been so frustrating, please fix your shit riot. I know that my internet connection is flawless and not the problem here, I'm paying good money for it, and also, in dota I have absolutely no problems with it.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-15T17:54:19.384+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lag spikes like this could be due to an unstable connection or packet loss to our game server.
