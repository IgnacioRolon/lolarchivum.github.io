It is comparable to Tristana's voice with a little more of Poppy's in-game tone to it.\n\nThe weird thing is its constant reference to \"heroes\" or a \"hero\". Since it was added to the announcer VO it is either for a new game mode, or it is a teaser for something like how Kindred gave random messages before their release. It might not be Poppy at all, but IMO it would make a really decent voice for her.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSvNisIDIuU\n\nSince her rework is going to be Sion-level it is safe to assume that her lore will be considerably different, BUT it could also use some of her original lore as a base. Her original lore is already quite decent though so they could expand on it rather than remove it.\n\nWhat if her job as ambassador of Bandle City was to seek out heroes to fight Noxus?

Half the people when this audio came out swore it was Illaoi.\n\n***\n\nIm still thinking that these lines are for an event tying in to her VU as well as a **Noxus vs Demacia event**. Swain just got updated splash art on the PBE so maybe they'll do a few minor VUs for both sides as well. Like Miss Fortune sized VUs.\n\nMaybe some stats tuning to Swain, Galio, J4, Urgot, Sion, and Xin Zhao- maybe more- which could be more reasons why the Poppy update feels \"late\" to the others in this thread. It will probably be Harrowing update-sized with similar Lore updates.
