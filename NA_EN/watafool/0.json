But gameplay wise, he just doesn&#039;t feel very interesting. Throw Wild Cards, TP in with ult, and stun someone. That&#039;s the core of what he does. Does he have a high skill cap? Hell yeah. Have I mastered him? Hell no! But I think he could be a lot more fun to play. I feel like he should be quick and evasive, while whittling down enemies with cards. He has part of that. The attack speed on his E combined with the wild cards and stun or slow help him accomplish the whittling down (and I would even argue his burst is too high when he gets items), but I feel like he needs something to make him more fun to play. \r\n\r\n\r\nWhat changes would you guys like to see for TF to make him more interesting?\r\n\r\nRiot, do you have any plans to redevelop TF&#039;s gameplay?","replies":[]}
