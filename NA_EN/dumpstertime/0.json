I know  in the past the old patch fked it up for alot of people and it was never fixed.  How can RIOT help in this matter?  My friends see me as the leader of the clan, I have no clan because it wiped it on my side but kept it client side?? I Don't have a TAG.  My friends still do. They can fully use it but cannot add me, invite me or kick me from leader position.  Hopefully a Mod can help me?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-08-16T20:45:50.383+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I may be able to help with this!
