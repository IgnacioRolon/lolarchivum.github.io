The BEST part is that it doesn&#039;t really look like Kog&#039;Maw&#039;s other skins since most of them seem to be either a recolor, texture change, or simply an added layer (besides battlecast and lion dance). I&#039;m happy to add this to my complete collection of Kog&#039;Maw skins :)!","replies":[{"poster":"NewGuy101","date":"2017-03-08T01:42:15.978+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like it.\n\nWhat I don't understand is why people don't like his skins because they look \"ugly\". Kog is a void monster; he was never made to be cute or adorable visually. You can put as much makeup as you want on a boar, it still looks like a boar.","replies":[{"poster":"NodirjonSattarov","date":"2017-03-08T01:47:03.626+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Finally someone that is reasonable!\n\nI think this is his best skin by far.
