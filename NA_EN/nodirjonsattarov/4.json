I've only solo laned vs Zoe as TF. Any time I walk up to stun her she face throws her E and I get sleepy for 2 whole seconds. TF gold card lasts 1 second (increasing to 2 at max rank) so I literally can't trade with her if I get hit by the face E. \"So just dodge it?\" The ability has 800range whereas my TF aa range is 525. Good Zoe's either play aggressive with E knowing they can hit it or they hold onto it knowing they'll win the trade when engaged on.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"MooooooooreDakka","date":"2018-02-14T04:28:28.167+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm assuming you mean season 5 ap kog. First, as someone mentioned, Zoe also lacks an aoe stun. Second, kog ult had a lower cooldown, didn't require putting him close to danger, and could ignore minions/body blocking.

I'm comparing how Zoe can sling her spells over and over again either clearing waves or one-shotting anything. \n\n> kog ult had a lower cooldown, didn't require putting him close to danger\nLower cooldown, yes. But abominable mana costs associated with it. You literally have to wait until Seraphs to spam R but even then you aren't at the luxury or smashing your R key. The biggest complaint about AP Kog is reliable damage at a safe distance. But reliable =/= being able to one shot squishies. To be successful on AP Kog, you have to be able to land Q, E, R, R, R or at least E, R , R. If you don't at least land E then you're done. All of AP Kog's main abilities cost so much mana (E starting out at 80 mana and R stacking mana). Zoe just waits for her CD on E and Q or just Q itself. With the abundance of CDR she really doesn't have to wait that long.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Taliyah Rocks","date":"2018-02-14T04:56:21.038+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Maybe because Zoe requires linesight for all of her spells?
