There's no particular reason for hard CC to behave inconsistently relative to mobility when displacements have always been coded to knock champions out of their dashes, and the fact that this separation still exists I think speaks more to legacy coding and balancing on Riot's part than anything else. Allowing hard CC to cleanly knock dashing targets down would add a ton more consistency to the game, as well as generate much more meaningful interaction between the two effects (most CC is already difficult to land on fast-moving opponents, so it doesn't need to also have a reduced impact when it does land). Additionally, it could probably limit knockup creep by some amount, as I suspect many champions got displacements on their kits, simply because displacements are better stuns.","replies":[{"poster":"ZT Xperimentor","date":"2018-08-01T13:48:31.871+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That that entirely concur with, and it's why displacements were rare to begin with, until they nerfed tenacity.
