Displacements last a set time for consistent behavior during things like Poppy's E. Since they're unaffected by Tenacity, they're already balanced with that fact in mind. If they were affected by Tenacity, they'd last longer, and you'd be expected to acquire some Tenacity to bring the duration down to a reasonable level, just like how Mundo's ult is way too strong while he's unaffected by GW.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pika Fox","date":"2019-10-22T05:41:57.428+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Tenacity affects stuns. Most knockups that last more than half a second are affected by tenacity because they are accompanied by a stun. Tenacity does not affect displacements, but allows you to gain control faster during them. As such, if youre knocked up, you can use cleanse/oranges/QSS during the knockup to gain control of your character back, but will need to flash to negate the knockup (or use another mobility ability)","replies":[]}]}
