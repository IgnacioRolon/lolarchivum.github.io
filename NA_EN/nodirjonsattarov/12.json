As the game currently is, with level 3 boots gone and homeguard being a game mechanic rather than a buyable upgrade, Zephyr would see far more play.  Zephyr had a very strong niche, whereas Poacher's Dick is just another iteration of Rito's failed concept of rewarding counter-jungling.\n\nIt's time Rito admits the Poacher's items are a failed idea and will never be viable without an unhealthy level of power.","replies":[{"poster":"ChaoticPinecone","date":"2017-03-29T07:08:25.561+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":8,"body":"Would you really buy Zepher?\n\nLets think about it this way: Irelia pretty much always defaults into a Trinity rush. After that point, you have the option for more damage or going tanky. If youre going tanky, you wouldnt buy Zepher. Currently with the strength of BotRK, it seems almost stupid to not get a BotRK over a Zephyr. At earliest, youre looking at a 4th item item Zephyr. However, most people I know opt for a little bit of tank stats (GA/Steraks/Maw) or full tank stats (Randiuns/Spirit Visage) at that point. And as for its usefulness, Id say that it still isnt ever the best choice - all it does is give AD, AS, Tenacity, and CDR. I would rather get a Wits End for the triple threat of AD/Magic/True damage. \n\nThe only time I see Zephyr being a \"good\" purchase is if you sell your boots, which is the exact reason it was removed in the first place. An item thats only viable as a 7th item isnt really good. I mean, you could leave it in the game but to say \"Zepher would see far more play\" is a definite overstatement. Zephyr already saw that same amount of play when it was around - when people were full build with 3k+ gold. \n\nWhile Poachers isnt very rewarding, it does have its niche as the counterjungle AD item. It doesnt get used because its too inefficient, but the niche is still there (I personally think a health-stacking item that turns into a Giants Belt would be nice). On the other hand, Zephyr doesnt really have a niche, unless you think 60+ minute end game builds are a niche that needs to be filled.","replies":[{"poster":"Yuzuki Yukarin","date":"2017-03-29T08:14:38.532+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":2,"body":"You don't seem to understand WHY Irelia bought Zephyr.  Irelia is of course a dive-champ; jump onto the ADC, take him out of the fight then act as a pseudo-tank taking the enemy's focus for your team.\n\nNow as an Irelia player would know and it's clear YOU don't know, the common trick to do this was by utilizing the reset on her Q.  Q to caster minion, 1-shot it, get the reset, Q to enemy ADC.  Now, if you actually knew Irelia's numbers, you'd know after a point the caster minions scale just outside of that range with just Tri-force, but the 25 attack from pickaxe is the cheapest option to keep this play possible for the longest amount of time during the game.  As you also don't realize, pickaxe has very shitty options for what it upgrades into and even fewer options now that Last Whisper is no longer one of them.  Like you said, Zephyr gave Tenacity, CDR, AS, AD AND **MOVEMENT SPEED**(which you conveniently overlooked.)  Literally all 5 of these are amazing stats for Irelia, if you knew her kit.  The Tenacity in particular is a notable point, giving a desperately needed alternative to Mercury Treads which Summoner's Rift now has ZERO other options.  It opened up the possibilities to have Tenacity while still being able to buy Zerkers, Swifties, or even Lucidity, but most importantly **NINJA TABI.**\n\nAs the game is right now, still slowly recovering from the damage of the assassin meta, literally all 5 roles are buying Ninja Tabi to counter the toxicity of lethality assassins, which makes it impossible to buy Mercs in the majority of games.  Something else that you seem to have conveniently overlooked.\n\nZephyr was an important item for dive-bruisers and with them on Rito's radar for buffs, this is the most opportune time for Rito to realize their mistake and return the item to League.","replies":[{"poster":"ChaoticPinecone","date":"2017-03-29T20:41:32.532+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"First of all, why are you being such an ass.
