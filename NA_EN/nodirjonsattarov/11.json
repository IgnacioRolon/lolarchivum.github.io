E ratio down by 20% and base damage down by 5 per level, 1% increase on W (LOL 1%), and ult doesn't execute anymore and doesn't poke efficiently. the ult changes are laughable because it was changed exactly at the time of E nerfs since it was powerful on ap kog. ult damage was shifted towards less of an execute and more of a poke. now its a limp execute and shitty poke. whats riots excuse? \"we think he's in a good spot for now gg kids\"","replies":[{"poster":"ProfDrDeath","date":"2017-02-23T16:30:58.713+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, the lower AD was something that every single ADC received.
