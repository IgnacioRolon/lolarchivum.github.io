You, a male, do not get to decide what is/isn&#039;t sexualized for a woman. It&#039;s simple as that. Do not speak for them, do not speak at all on matters that only concern women. If something that women deem sexualized comes out then it is what it is, sexual. BUT you don&#039;t get to come out and say &quot;well, my opinion is that Kai&#039;sa isn&#039;t being sexualized because she&#039;s a void and her V-line is supposed to do [insert bullshit attribute 1] and [insert bullshit attribute 2]&quot; \n\nInstead what you could do is appreciate it if you like it or support those standing up to the disgrace.\n\nedit: if you don't have anything progressive to say, don't bother saying it","replies":[]}
