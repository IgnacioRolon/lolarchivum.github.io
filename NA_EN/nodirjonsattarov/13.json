Well, the blind countered their beloved ADCs too much, so then we get patch 1.0.0.108 \n> Now reduces (auto/basic) attack damage by 70% and ability/item damage by 35% instead of blinding for the duration.\n\n\nOkay, so now Exhaust slows, reduces ability damage by 35%, reduces item damage by 35% and reduces basic attack damage by 70%.  It was nerfed in its primary goal, and still allows those farmed late game carries to pump out 30% of their DPS during this duration; to compensate this, all ability damages are lowered by 35% making exhaust more target agnostic.\n\nFast forward 44 patches (or 23 months) to 1.0.0.152 and Exhaust gets changed around again.  \n\n> Movement speed reduction reduced to 30% from 40%.\n> New Effect: Now reduces attack speed by 50%.\n> New Effect: Now reduces all damage dealt by 30% from 70% for attacks and 30% from abilities/items \n\nHere what they tried to do was improve clarity by not having different % damage reduction values, and nerf its effect as seen by the 35% -> 30% reduction, and reducing the slow; which was important as only the highest slow applies at any time, and the meta then was influenced by items having 30%, or 35% slows so making exhaust into a 30% slow meant it was never more powerful than those other slows including ones by Randuin's, Frozen Mallet (this was in fratmogs season) and Rylai's and so basically ceases to exist as soon as one of those slows is applied\n\nThey still wanted it to be an anti-late-game-carry spell, so they replaced the additionally damage reduction with an attack speed slow.  Now, originally the attack speed slow was actually stronger than the damage reduction that was removed, making the net change on an ADC 10% more movement speed for 10% less auto attack DPS during Exhaust, and making non-auto reliant champions better off with lower damage reduction and a lesser slow.\n\nThree years ago they inverted the numbers, and bumped up the cast range.\n  \n>     Attack speed cripple reduced to 30% from 50%.\n>     Damage reduction increased to 50% from 30%.\n>     Range increased to 650 from 550.  \n\nEight patches later, in 4.13 we get this.\n\n>     Damage reduction reduced to 40% from 50%.\n>     New Effect: Now reduces the target's armor and magic resistance by 10. \n\nWhere RIOT realized 50% damage reduction was a bit too high, and it was starting to be a tankier meta, so they slapped a resist shred on to compensate for the nerf.\n\nExhaust was originally an offensive spell that became so good at preventing retaliations and escapes that it was redesigned to counter late game ADCs.  Since then it has only been spread out to more and more targets until it has the wide variety it has today.  \n\nExhaust went untouched since July 30th, 2014 and has been completely balanced this entire fucking time.  The recent changes were not necessary, and you are mischategorizing the purpose of this summoner spell.\n\n  \nAlso, they've nerfed ghost multiple times for competing with flash, and change exhaust when it gets picked more than ignite with seemingly random changes that they even go the opposite direction of in the next round of nerfs/buffs.

They are tanks MEANT to murder ADCs. How you beat them is with help. That is like complaining how you lost to a 1v1 vs a Jax or Fiora when they are made to be 1v1 champs.\n\nThe reason they were nerfed is simply because Riot is lazy and or stupid. Its basically no different than Rammus being nerfed. He wasn't a good pick and people didn't even know who he was. But during the 3+ ADC meta or full AD meta he came back above ground since hey....his sole purpose is to counter AD. But since that isn't allowed with Riot, they nerfed Rammus when he was already basically garbage, and nerfed Thornmail to its even more pitiful state if I recall right. And Thornmail was already kinda garbage to begin with, only Malphite and Rammus truly ever bought it. Or against teams dumb enough to go full AD.\n\nIts no different with {{summoner:3}} being nerfed. There was NOTHING wrong with the spell, damage in the game was too stupidly high, it did the same thing since it came out basically, and suddenly its a problem since League of 1 hit kills suddenly couldn't 1 hit kill since people realized that spell saved them. Riot instead of being smart and knowing that it was a counter to stupid high damage and leaving it, nerfed it for no reason at all. It was barely even overused anyways, at most I saw 2 on a team, but ya know, that isn't allowed seeing as 4 {{summoner:3}} in a game isn't alright but 10 {{summoner:4}} is.","replies":[{"poster":"ThatHaleState","date":"2017-03-12T20:56:09.020+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Shonjl,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=qHymJQdJ,comment-id=00030000,timestamp=2017-03-10T16:43:58.219+0000)\n>\n> Why would an ADC ever in a million years want to try to fight a Nautilus or Maokai alone?

Tanks are not to supposed to be able to kill anything. Tanks are supposed to stay alive and soak everything like a wall of iron.  League is the only game that has tanks that can 100-0 an adc in one rotation of spells.  Soon your statement wont be correct anymore.  The game is built so that you can outstack resists with damage.

But yeah, anything should be able to kill ADCs not late game, moreso tanks since they get their most power basically as soon as their first full item and during midgame. Should Naut or Mao kill a full build ADC? If the ADC is bad perhapes but overall ADC should murder them that I agree with.\n\nADCs are squishy after all, it doesn't take an Assassin to kill one, they just do it the quickest.\n\nAlso you are saying something is wrong with the game is a tank, something that is at its strongest during the mid game can beat an ADC, which is the weakest in the game til lategame is a problem? There is a reason you want to get the ADC fed if possible, since they are balls worthless til then since autos are garbage early on. Like I hate when I get killed playing ADC as well, but at the same time its my fault if I let a Mao walk up to me.\n\nThe issue if they outright gut all damage of tanks is they get ignored which is even worse. Why you think things like Mundo are kinda a joke, sure he can deal damage due to his kit and if he builds some damage, but since he has no real cc he can be entirely ignored. So what will happen is more carries will be top, would you rather have it more snowbally when Yasuo, Fiora, and ADCs rule top again? Since tanks are the things keeping them in check.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"IronWraith","date":"2017-03-11T00:12:39.437+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, the only reason why ninja tabis is gaining popularity is because of all the AD teams being played.

Tabi does not reduce On-Hit damage so MF's Love Tap passive damage does not get reduced. That includes BOTRK's passive, Fiora's Vital Points, and Irelia's W that you were 99% sure about. You saying it blocks abilities is not only misleading but a complete strawman. It only blocks Basic Attacks and Basic Attack Modifiers.\n\n2. \"you're spending 800 gold to take away 6k of theirs\" is an absolute over exaggeration. While yes you're blocking 30-40 lethality but you're sure aint blocking all that damage and dusk blade proc. So in reality, Ninja only takes away 600-800 gold from them. So its pretty even. In other words, it does its job.\n\n3. Tabi's Passive does not gain more value as you gain more armor. INSTEAD it loses more value the more armor you receive. Lets say you have 100 armor which equals 50% physical dmg reduction. Ninja Tabi's passive is 12%. Based on how Riot does calculations, both combined will only block 56% damage. That is literally half of Tabi's Value. Like Doran's Shield's block, it loses more value the more you gain resistances. \n\n4.

No matter what. Damage reduction does not get less effective the more of it is stacked. The problem is % penetration in the game, not the efficiency of stacking armor/damage reductions. \n\nFor example: Stacking MR still completely fucks APs, even with Void Staff. There's a reason that isn't an issue with armor.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
