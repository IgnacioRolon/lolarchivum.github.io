Simply put, the Average Player isn't good enough for the Meta to matter.\n\nNo once a player gains enough Mechanical Skill, and once a player is with Team Mates that can Effectively Communicate... Meta starts to really have an impact.\n\nBut let's say \"Cinderhulk\" or \"Sunfire Cape\" is a 'MUST ITEM' on Champion X.  What if I'm not good at sticking to opponents to get more Damage Ticks on them?  Then I'm wasting a ton of the reason I got the Cinder or Sunfire.

THAT is what should matter.\n\nI had a friend, way better than me (Plat+) and he made a smurf to play with me.  Usually we played legit, but his skill level was really high so sometimes we'd go Off-Meta for more fun (yes, we have done Thresh/Blitzcrank Hook City... we also did a Deny CS with Quinn/Teemo).  He went Zed ADC.  Even I was like... umm... you sure about that?  I grab my Leona, he proceeds to crap all over our Enemies in Lane then hard carries with one of the rare 30 Kill Games I've seen, while still hitting objectives with the Team.\n\nThe Enemy Lane had no clue how to Duo Lane vs. a Zed that had a Leona.  Likely they knew how to Duo against another ADC/Support Lane... but simply going Off Meta completely destroyed them.\n\nIf you can dominate as Zed, and your best chance to Win is to play Zed... play Zed, and screw the Meta.  But try to ensure your Zed has a positive impact on the Team Comp.\n\nMeta only matters at the Higher End of Skill and Communication... but you got people in Bronze flaming because some one bought this instead of that or took X Champion to Y Lane.  \n\nJust like those crying in Q that they lost in Pick/Ban... Pick/Ban ONLY matters if you know what the Enemy Team is good at or weak against.
