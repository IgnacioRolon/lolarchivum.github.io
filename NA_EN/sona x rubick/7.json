They might not always win the game, which is why she doesn't appear as a problem when you look at winrate, but that is not what you should be looking at anyways.

Even a bad Vayne can kill 2 or 3 people, specially at low elo where squishy carries consistently position incorrectly.

Now that armorpen is gone and crit is actually \"viable\" again or favorable u see the typical offenders rising: Jinx, Cait, Twitch. \nI'm actually surprised that Trist doesn't show up though might be because she hasn't been changed that much and other carries do the same job just better meaning: Jinx--->Better range, AOE crits, 1k AOE \"execute\" and the same attack speed. \nCait: Safer, incredible sieging power, headshots. \nTwitch: Not necessarily safer but also shredding the whole team, can pop out of stealth leaving very little reaction time especially for squishies and snowballs harder.\n\nVayne here is just present because her Q buffs+ the change how her Q crits pushed her over the top, WAY over the top. Also the removal of flat arpen gives vayne enough windows to catch up again. Lucians, Jhins and MFs would shit on her all 20 minutes and end the game. Now that crazy snowball potential is gone and with warlords vayne can farm rather save until she reaches that crazy IE+Shiv powerspike two shotting enemy adcs.\n\n\nI'd be actually glad if you would look into marksmen itemization. If you can fix this+the current heavy colossus abuser without trashing tanks like nautilus we might see one of the most balanced seasons again. \n\nI hope my points are clear, unfortunately english is not my first language and i sometimes have trouble to make my points clear :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2016-11-18T16:42:50.794+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":1,"body":"...no. \n\nNo. No. No. NOT AFTER YOU GAVE ASSASSINS AN INCREASED KILL WINDOW!\n\nThey should be nerfing ADCs to actually be weak in these windows while still having counterplay. \n\n#If you're going to buff every marksman to Vayne level, then you might as well buff everyone else to be stupid!","replies":[{"poster":"Rebonack","date":"2016-11-18T16:45:56.144+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ralanr,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=JV4Vi4Pw,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-11-18T16:42:50.794+0000)\n>\n> ...no. \n> \n> No. No. No. NOT AFTER YOU GAVE ASSASSINS AN INCREASED KILL WINDOW!\n> \n> They should be nerfing ADCs to actually be weak in these windows while still having counterplay. \n> \n> #If you&#x27;re going to buff every marksman to Vayne level, then you might as well buff everyone else to be stupid!\n\nWhen everyone's super, then no one is.","replies":[{"poster":"Critmaster Garen","date":"2016-11-18T20:31:20.460+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Rebonack,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=JV4Vi4Pw,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2016-11-18T16:45:56.144+0000)\n>\n> When everyone&#x27;s super, then no one is.\n\nthats not how it works.\n\nwhen they only keep buffing damage, then no one is tanky. this means champions with kits who can reliably apply damage outshadow everyone else. and thats mostly going to be ranged adc.\n\nlets be real here. there is only a small group of fighters and tanks who can use courage of the colossus reliably who are actually tanky right now. this small group might be too tanky with the mastery, but theyre forgetting that everyone else who stacks defense and doesnt have some form of hard cc is absolute shit already comparably and gets blown up like theyre made out of paper mache.\n\nnow theyre not only planning to nerf colossus to bring these couple of champions back in line with those who are shit, but additionally they plan to buff damage all across the board on top of that. theyre planning to buff damage masteries, items and adc at the same time they want to nerf that one mastery that only a fraction of the champion pool can use and that is the cause of some champions being tanky.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Spoofghoul","date":"2016-11-18T19:20:24.707+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you mean only adc's are super everything else will be dogshit\n\ngotcha\n\nwill be fun game\n\npeople leaving in droves queue time over 9000 cuz everyone wants bot\n\nand when u get in game 5 adc's, yes even the support is now an adc","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Aptest","date":"2016-11-18T16:45:18.118+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot, \n\nAs a support main, I implore you:\nNO.\n\nuse this instead:\nhttps://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31d5-fuIZML.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"1 800 Top Lane","date":"2016-11-18T19:57:32.767+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hah its funny because its a nerf bat","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"FireDrizzle","date":"2016-11-18T16:42:50.216+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can we see the quote?

You'll have to nerf them to the point where it will be harder to find an adc in solo queue than support. Or, you could make reworks like Morde without screwing then up as happened in his case.\n\nVayne is just guaranteed to be strong in a meta of assassins. Her power level otherwise isn't that much better than the other carries. Also, the removal of ghostblade as an ADC item sharply increased her power. She can now reliably duel enemy ADCs with the combo of a BF and shiv. Before you were taking a relatively large risk by trying to duel a lucian with a ghostblade, but not anymore. \n\nIt's really a very complex situation. Ghostblade items got removed, but most carries aren't suit to be able to make a big splash in the early-mid game with crit build. Vayne with Q max can actually do that. Plus she can fight back against assassins, potentially being able to win a duel if she doesn't get 1 shot. \n\nSo we're stuck with little to no variety in itemization, little to no variety in champion strength, and from what I've noticed, game impact is very inconsistent. I have seen a Twitch hard carry, literally 1v5, then the next game both carries aren't even 2nd in damage and are contributing little. \n\nMore than ever exists the problem of the bot lane not being able to snowball by themselves.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zepper","date":"2016-11-18T23:51:45.868+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It does not matter whether your thoughts on vayne or how the game should be balanced is right or wrong, you should always show respect towards those who work hard for this community, especially Meddler.
