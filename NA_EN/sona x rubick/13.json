He named his character \"Quantis\" (something he made up on the spot). I thought that was a pretty cool sounding name. Years later, I was playing Skyrim with the Dawnguard DLC. In the Soul Cairn, you meet a dragon named Durnehviir, and when you defeat him he calls you \"\"Qahnaarin\" which means \"Vanquisher\". Hearing that word/name reminded me of the beastly character my dad would play as. I had no idea how it was spelt, so I kinda fused the two names together and gave my own spelling.

Back then I hadn't really started playing online games and stuck to playing Pokémon and watching tv shows. \n\nOne of the tv shows I used to watch was Chaotic, if any of you know that show. It really was awesome seeing all those creatures and things fight, and the idea of a second world that you experience while you like your life was FUCKING AWSOME. \n\nOne day my friends brought up a game to me called Club Penguin, and in order to 'fit in' I guess, I decided to get an account. Realizing I couldn't ( or maybe shouldn't) use my real name like I used to in all my Pokémon games, I decided to go along with one of the names of the characters from the show, 'Kas'. The problem with club penguin is that the name was too short, and in all my 9 or however year old intelligence, I wanted to use something that rhymed, I went with \"Kasfas\". ( it was meant to be pronounced Kazfaz, but EVERYONE got it wrong, so I kinda gave up on that). \n\nAnd that's pretty much the username I've used for everything since then.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Extreme Evil","date":"2016-07-23T05:40:43.108+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:45}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"OsámaQuinnLáden","date":"2016-07-23T02:26:29.228+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"My current SN was born in irony since I was pretty new to League, and not that great at playing whatsoever when I came up with it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mordepool","date":"2016-07-23T00:35:20.730+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mordekaiser + Deadpool= Mordepool  have had it since season 1 back when noone knew who deadpool was","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sypher The Poro","date":"2016-07-23T00:05:02.255+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sypher was a combination of Samus from Metroid and Cipher as in a computer Cipher due to my love of computers.\n\nOriginally it was Sypher40 from the number I had in baseball but changed it once I hit 200K points on Riven.\n\nI also got the coveted Exile tag, the club filled up in 10 minutes. :P","replies":[]},{"poster":"7 Fires","date":"2016-07-22T23:45:54.443+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mine is referencing the seven layers of hell where my soul eternally burns :3","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gay Dog","date":"2016-07-22T19:07:03.417+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i dont know how to explain...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Matarra","date":"2016-07-22T16:31:50.740+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was thinking of a name for a waw custom zombie map i was making, and i came up with matarra.
