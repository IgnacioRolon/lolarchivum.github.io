Also many many new Champs and items so I doubt the same Champs will perform in exactly the same way insomuch as to be boring.\n\nYou are probably right about early pressure being a bit more important, but I don't think that is too bad of a thing. Warwick is being reworked quite soon anyway and shyvana has been promised buffs, so that takes two delayed impact Champs out of the panic room. At least there will probably be more ganks in solo queue","replies":[]}]}
