First of all, it seems there are two basic ways that RIot matches your games in SoloQ.\n\n1. Put you on a team with players of an average MMR that is *approximately equal* to the MMR of the opposing team.\n\n2. Put you on a team with players of an average MMR that is *intentionally lower* than the MMR of the opposing team.\n\n(1) is what normally happens when you climb throughout the ladder. You are basically 1 man (or woman) with 9 roughly equivalent other players. Your tendency to win or lose is what demonstrates that you are better or worse than average players at your level. (2), by contrast, is an additional step that sometimes takes place after (1). While it's always possible for your team to have a lower average MMR than the enemy -- there is no guarantee of a perfect fit -- sometimes Riot will build this in to your designated matchmaking to increase the difficulty. The basic philosophy is \"Okay, so you've been able to win against equal teams-- let's see what you can do when you really have to carry\". \n\nThere used to be a lot of argument about the MM system, especially before RIot's major overhaul with the league system. For now, I'm assuming that standard MM system is very fair, which I think it is. In other words, **I have no gripe at all with (1) above, the standard MM in which your team and the enemy team are on roughly equal footing.** What I'm critiquing is (2). \n\nWhile this may seem like a hazy difference, in fact it's very important. When your chance of winning is well below the enemy team's chance before loading even begins, it forces you into certain playstyles and out of others. What it forces you into is a hard carry mindset. The reason is obvious. Your teammates are now less reliable, and your enemies are now stronger. Anything that pushes your teammates to secondary importance, and focuses on you as the active agent within the game, gets a major buff. Any strategy, build, playstyle, tactic, etc. that involves significant teammate cooperation just got a lot less viable. This second playstyle is what we put under the umbrella of Utility. It's teammate buffs, enemy debuffs, certain types of CC, heals, shields and speedboosts-- in short, anything that is not an end in itself, but rather a means to an end, usually involving your fellow players. While the most obvious position that comes to mind is support, really this affects players in all roles. To see it as solely a support issue misses a lot of the truth.\n\nThis is where I have to be careful. **What I'm not saying is that all of SoloQ is unfair to supports/utility/anyone who isn't Riven.** I'm specifically talking about the situation that I call (2) above-- where Riot is intentionally matching you with a worse team and against a better team in order to increase the game's difficulty. The effect of this method is extremely uneven across champions and playstyles, and requires a different approach than when you are the tenth \"walk on\" to a field of 9 similar competitors. To force this approach is highly negative to all aspects of teamwork, and IMO does a disservice to players who are trying to improve, as well as to the overall competitive scene. \n\n**TlDR: If Riot wants to find a way to further test rising players, so be it, but putting them on deliberately worse teams promotes a strong bias against utility. On a relative basis, this hits some playstyles much harder than others.**","replies":[]}
