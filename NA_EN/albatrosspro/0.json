I find if you are down one full tank, your chances of winning are small... if you're down more than that, it's nearly impossible. Example: Malphite Kha Ahri Janna Lucian vs. Sion Maokai Viktor Sona Graves. The former team will have a tough time winning unless they really snowball hard. Now change Sona to Thresh, and it's almost guaranteed. They will win every teamfight and steamroll even if the first team got ahead at first.\n\nI don't remember team comp being quite this crucial in solo queue before. Is it just me or is this meta affecting overall comps as well as just lanes in a way that others didn't?","replies":[]}
