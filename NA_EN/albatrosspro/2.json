Every time I&#039;m disappointed, but this time I&#039;m especially smh. This is a large and profitable company by now employing lots of talented people. I just don&#039;t buy that they&#039;re dumb, stupid, or incompetent. Maybe S1 or S2. Not now.\r\n\r\nNot having a balanced game creates a sense of excitement for those riding the OP trains. Keeping people on their toes, while it turns off some users, evidently more than compensates by giving 15 year olds the thrill of getting a KDA well above their skill grade, assuming they can lock in the OP champ. Since there are certainly more than 6 of said champs, they have a good shot to do just that every game.\r\n\r\nTLDR: Lack of balance has to be a business strategy by now. Please stop living in denial; either accept that fact or leave the game, but QQ over a lack of balance is like yelling at KFC for making fried foods","replies":[]}
