If I win 5 games in three's where the team is gold and 5-7 games in ranked 5v5's with my team does that count as 10 games for all queues or do I have to win 10 games in 3's AND in team 5's?","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2013-10-01T23:42:35.488+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Funkel,\n\nI'm sorry for the confusion!  You have to win 10 games for EACH ranked team queue.  Therefore, in order to earn Gold rewards, you will need to win 10 games for your 3v3 Ranked Team queue.  In order to earn 5v5 rewards on the same team, you will need 10 total wins in 5v5 matches.\n\nI hope this alleviates some confusion!  :)","replies":[{"poster":"Funkel","date":"2013-10-02T02:10:32.288+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That is very helpful and incredible clear sense the patch. the new feature points it out great and it makes tons of sense.
