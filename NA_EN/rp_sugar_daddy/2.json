Picked Jinx with my Thresh. Not a bad pick.\n\nThen 5th pick comes by, picks poppy and satys hes only gonna go bot and feed, picks clarity + teleport. \n\nSo im forced to Dodge, and get the warning for a &quot;leaver&quot; and lose LP, or play the game and lose 15 LP.\n\n*Jigsaw Voice* Lets play a game, do you dodge and lose lp and possibly get banned, or do you play and waste 30 minutes and 18 lp. Live or die, make your choice!\n\n\nedit-\n\nScratch this, had to dodge this morning too, so i lost 10 lp and 30minute wait time now. Thanks riot for allowing elo terrorists. Wouldnt be so bad if i didnt have to wait the 30 minutes, cause me, the guy trying to avoid the troll, is the one that gets punished, while he gets to reque up and try and get what HE wants without getting punished or losing LP, or wasting any extra time.
