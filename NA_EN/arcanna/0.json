I reported several times before but still seeing the guy on. I got screenshot but current in client player report doesn't allow for attachment. \r\n\r\nBefore people say \"it's just aram\" or \"it's just some kid bluffing.\" I can handle trash talk, people afk, or rage feeding but threatening to hack and cyber attack people seems like a whole different level of bad behavior that should not be tolerated in any of the game modes.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-16T00:48:47.562+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't believe we actively take any reports of threats of DDoSing.
