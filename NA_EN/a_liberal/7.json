(pointing towards creature)\r\nUndergowth (Pointing towards brush)\r\n**COWARD!!!!** (pointing towards creature again)\r\nIn battle the stream snapper (In the other language it says In the battle of Bucket Creek)\r\nALWAYS IS RUNNING AWAY! RUNNING AWAY!\r\n\r\n\r\nSome sort of cowardly amphibian that lives in the undergrowth and is always running away.\r\n\r\nAlso, IDK if Kled is the name of the champion? Or maybe the artist?","replies":[{"poster":"geya","date":"2016-07-10T08:17:13.841+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its kog'maw >_>","replies":[{"poster":"A Liberal","date":"2016-07-10T16:10:14.739+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally my theory is that while yes, character in the poster is Kogmaw, Kled, the character, is a hunter/bounty hunter. A little more spculatory, but remember this: http://akwa.wish.org/wishes/wish-stories/wish-to-go/sam-riotgames\n\nWell he made a bounty hunter ADC that used a rumble-heat system for special auto attacks.\n\nAlso i'm excited to have a redneck sounding character, but thats just me.\n\nOh also this: \n\nhttp://a.disquscdn.com/uploads/mediaembed/images/3922/5110/original.jpg\n\nSome people are saying it's a project ashe teaser but honestly it looks different from anyone else in the game as of current. Maybe its the release skin?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"InhaleMyGayWhale","date":"2016-07-09T23:41:02.112+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe those creatures in these pictures are the ones that make the noises in the brush teaser, and the Champion has smth to do with hunting them or just disliking them?
