I'm fairly certain they were still on Howling Abyss in 4.18, but I don't see anything about them being removed in the 4.19 notes.","replies":[{"poster":"FeralPony","date":"2014-11-05T22:25:31.359+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"This was unintentional sorry :( . Aram should be getting the new Elixirs with the Preseason changes which would mean disabling the current elixirs. Seems we got a little trigger happy and disabled the current elixirs before we added in the new ones. I'm unsure if we'll be able to do a redeploy to fix this issue specifically or not (a lot goes into the call to redeploy) but Elixirs will return to ARAM. \n\nThanks for reporting the problem!","replies":[{"poster":"Poro Supremacy","date":"2014-11-05T22:37:13.407+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright, good to know.
