I absolutely love her playstyle. I recently picked up Hecarim, and I&#039;m quickly falling in love with Hecarim as well. I was if anyone could suggest some champs that rush a damage item, spike hard in the mid game serving as a pseudo-assassin, then build tank and become more akin to a bruiser/tank late game. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!","replies":[{"poster":"Defended","date":"2016-06-25T21:24:03.094+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wouldnt say darius.

Jayce and Rumble also have great mid-games but then don't build that tanky later on.  \n\nTrundle and Jax tend to give similar experiences but harder to assassinate as Trundle and you don't spike until later as Jax normally.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CerealBoxOfDoom","date":"2016-06-25T18:19:24.390+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"anyone who builds sheen and has mobility basically lol.\n\nor really just anyone who can rush items with hard hitting onhit effects. Like literally anyone. You could do it on teemo if you wanted","replies":[]}]}
