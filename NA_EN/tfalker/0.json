I lost my first match which I believe would have put me at 1-1.  Then I won my next match thinking I got promoted.  I played one more game and realized that it put me back into placements.\r\n\r\nCan this be looked at?  Thanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-03-01T05:27:34.967+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I took a look at your account and it seems you queue dodged during your promo series, which counts as a loss whenever you're in a series.\n\nI hope this cleared up the confusion! Let me know if you have any other questions.","replies":[{"poster":"TFalker","date":"2017-03-01T05:33:50.496+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah, now I know, thank you!","replies":[]}]}]}
