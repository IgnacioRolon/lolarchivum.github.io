Pretty boring stuff. Carved onto the side of the home he was created for, he had one job: be a pretty looking shoot for water in the gutters to pour out of. It really never rained where he was built, the gutters were always dry and if an inanimate object could feel useless that&#039;s probably how this little statue felt. Fate dealt him some good, if not really weird, cards though because low and fucking behold he got hit by _motherfuckin magic lightning_, which shattered him completely. (both physically and emotionally) He picked himself up (again, both physically and emotionally) and looked around. The house was completely fucked up, so assuming it didn&#039;t need his assistance with syphoning off rainwater, he set out into the world. As beings of pure electric energy are not known for their social skills, he ended up accidentally wrecking an entire trade port, which got the attention of the Summoners at Summoners Rift Inc. They called him up and were like \"Hey wanna fuck shit up and get payed to do it?\". Our static friend saw an opportunity to make friends and electrocute stuff so he quickly accepted. Now he is a part of a boyband, the respect life club, and has a strong left swing in tennis singles. \n\"I really truly believe the Summoners Rift was a good choice for Tezz.\"\n-Dr. Phill\n\n**Stats**\nHEALTH\t                514.4 (+80)\t\nATTACK DAMAGE\t54.7 (+3)\nHEALTH REGEN.\t5.42 (+0.55)\t\nATTACK SPEED       0.625 (+1.36%)\nMANA\t                316.96 (+47)\t\nARMOR\t                21.88 (+3.5)\nMANA REGEN.       6 (+0.8)\t\nMAGIC RES.\t       30 (+0)\nRANGED\t               525\t\nMOV.

From the age of 3, he was training his body. By 5, he was training his mind. And by 11, Yokohonda had defeated every other Sumo who had ever existed, ever.\n\nBut this wasn't enough for Yokohonda. He craved a greater challenge! And so he bargained his immortal soul unto a demon. The result? An ever growing roster of champions to test his limits against. Little did Yokohonda realise, the demon had planned this all along. With Yokohonda's request now official, the demon would create the fabled city of Icathia, open the Void, and release Cho'Gath upon Runeterra.\n\nYokohonda tried in vain to defeat the monster, barely escaping with his life:\n\n**\"Never before have I encountered a creature who's appetite is greater than my own.\"**\n\nIn an attempt to reach the girth (and raw power!) of Cho'gath, Yokohonda travelled the continent, eating anything and everything he came across. Hearing that Cho'Gath had somehow joined the league of legends, Yokohonda did the same. His drive to be the greatest Sumo wrestler in history would not be impeded!\n\nAlso, Yokohonda is 26 now.\n\nPicture of Yokohonda\n\nhttp://www.thegreenhead.com/imgs/sumo-wrestler-table-1.jpg\n\n#ABILITIES:\n\n**Passive: Kimarite**\nYokohonda is true Sumo superstar. If caught inside a circle, Yokohonda will have homefield advantage! Whenever caught inside a circle of any kind (J4's arena, Veigar's E, Graves' smokescreen, etc), Yokohonda will become immune to CC and be unable to be forced out of the circle due to his training. Salt will also be spread around the circle by Yokohonda.\n\n**Q: Oshidashi**\nYokohonda attempts to push his opponent out of the ring (don't say there is no ring: entire Rift is ring!), dealing no damage, but suppressing his target and slowly pushing them backwards. Yokohonda takes 20% reduced damage while using Oshidashi because of Sumo focus!\n\n**W: Mawashi Discard **\nYokohonda removes his Mawashi (Sumo Nappy), impairing vision for all enemy (and ally) champions in a 1000 pt radius. Affected can not see, but can smell Yokohonda's unwashed Mawashi, and will take damage based upon Yokohonda's Sumo proximity. Enemy is also feared if under the effects of Yokohonda's Oshidashi.\n\n**(Yoko)E: Honda**\nYokohonda Sumo-Springs himself into nearby opponent, dealing damage and smothering opponent! If the target cannot escape melee range of Yokohonda in 3 seconds, they will run out of oxygen and pass out until Yokohonda leaves. Yokohonda can reactivate (Yoko)E:Honda on an unconscious champion to sit on them and catch his breath.\n\n**R: Forbidden Fugu**\nYokohonda uses secret Sumo eating technique to expand his arteries and unlock potential hidden by high cholesterol! Drawing upon the Fugu detrodotoxins that would have killed any normal Sumo, Yokohonda will at last achieve ultimate Sumo status, gaining MS, Armour, MR and bonus AD for 16 seconds.\nYokohonda can reactivate Forbidden Fugu to Sumo surf to a target location on the map. A Sumo circle will spawn where Yokohonda lands, spreading rice and Mawashi that will need to be cleaned up before anyone can wrestle.\n\n#QUOTE AT CHAMPION SELECT\n\"You gonna finish that?\"","replies":[{"poster":"FluxBound","date":"2015-07-06T00:58:58.937+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But what if you spell shield his W?

All I'm saying, good concept overall.\nHere is a concept of my own! (Don't have numbers yet but whatever)\n\nJason Butterfingers, the Wannabe Vigilante\n\nYou see, ever since he was a boy, Jason has been fascinated with the League of Legends. He had his own replica of Garen's sword, with which he brought iron (rather, plastic) justice upon the household pests. As he grew up in the outskirts of Ionia, he trained his hardest and studied every champion he could, in attempt to one day be as strong as them. One time he actually tried fighting a bear in the Voodo Lands, and lost his hand to it (he now has a magic replacement that can extend great lengths.) Although he doesn't have any superhuman powers or flashy magic, he somehow made it into the League. He says he wanted to \"bring peace and justice to all.\" he didn't seem to hear the summoners snickering at his Jarvan IV impression.\n\nResource: Maybe Energy or Resourceless (of course if he was recourceless he would have higher cooldowns.)\nPreferred Role: Top lane offtank \n\nPassive: Instalok'ed on Target\nJason gains increased damage to the champion currently dealing the most damage to him. (In a teamfight, probably the ADC or Mid. This encourages him to go a bit tanky while also diving the backline.) Enemies targeted by his passive will be revealed by a mark for as long as they are dealing damage to him + a few secs.\n\nQ: Grapple Hand\nJason fires his (somewhat illegally acquired) magic Grappling Hand in a target direction. If it hits a minion or monster, it is immediately pulled to him (like a blitz grab) If it hits a champion, they are slowed and a tether is established between him and them. If the tether isn't broken in 2 seconds, the champion is pulled to Jason and takes medium damage.\n\nW: Sweep the Legs/ Awesome Blast\nJason lets loose his sweet karate moves, dealing AoE physical damage and slowing all enemies hit. If he hits a champion with Sweep the Legs, he briefly, gains access to Awesome Blast, which fires a ball of pure Awesomeness in a target direction. Auto Attacks reduce the Cool down of Sweep the Legs.\n\nE: Evasive Maneuver\n_\"Tactical Roll!\" -Jason_\nJason rolls a short distance in a target direction. If he rolls through a wall or past an enemy champion successfully, he gains a burst of movement speed. (note: he cannot use this while his Q tether is up)\n\nR: Super Katana!\nPassive: Basic attacks now have increased Attack Range (like release Tahm). Until now, hes been fighting with his fists. Now he uses a katana.\nActive: Jason empowers his Super Katana, bestowed upon him by a roadside merchant. Upon activation, Jason gets a short burst of movement speed and attack speed. When those wear off, he gets an attack damage buff and a small attack speed buff. \n(Edit: Removed \"When the duration is over, he chucks his sword in the direction of the cursor, dealing damage to the first enemy hit\" cause its basically riven. And if you haven't killed them by the time the ult is done, you don't deserve the kill)\n\n***Appearance***\nI think of Jason as a young man in his mid 20's, with ruffled dirty blond hair, electric blue eyes and a boyish face. As for clothing and gear, He would wear something along the lines of Indiana Jones and Han solo (Yea, double Harrison Ford, fight me about it) On his left arm is a golden gauntlet, which in turn is a mount for a glowing blue magic hand. In his right hand is the huge Super Katana, which may or may not be the single most powerful weapon in the universe. The sword itself looks like a stereotypical katana, but with an all-gold handle and guard, and a jet black blade. During his ult, is becomes engulfed in flames.\n\n\n(Added)\nPossible Items to build on him:\n\n{{item:3153}} The attack speed and life steal would be awesome, and the slow + ult could make him catch up to anyone\n\n{{item:3071}} Slice and dice through that armor!\n\n{{item:3072}} Lifesteal\n\n{{item:3087}} This + ult would be noice\n\n{{item:3155}} Good for close fights\n\n{{item:3748}} , {{item:3074}} With the extra range post 6, these passives would have more reach.\n\n{{item:3068}}    ]\n{{item:3065}}    ]   Defensive Stuff\n{{item:3512}}     ] \n\n{{item:3047}} {{item:3111}} {{item:3006}} Boots, depending on the game\n\nHope you like it!

Think of it as automated weaker basic attacks who proc on-hit like Black CLeaver but not sheen, CAN crit(none of that double crit bullshit Yasuo has, but can still crit if you build it) and can't proc sheen.  \n\nIf said attacks are all focused on a single champion, they'll get even more damage reduction.\n\nQ: Some boring augmented auto.\nW: Only defensive ability. Make you invulnerable/invisble for a sec(can't attack or be attacked, but can move). Dodge those Ezreal ult and be called the next Faker.\nE: Dash. That's it. No messing around, you jump graciously hop to the target location. Range is equal to Diana's Q.\nR: Get big cooldown reduction and attack speed. \n\nBasically, if you're good, you'll dodge and join the korean gods. If you're bad...you ded. Real squishy boy but can avoid lots of stuff.\n\nIf y'all want, i can make a really edgy story about vengeance or stuff, modern Ionians love that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"B3ER","date":"2015-07-07T15:13:05.678+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Holy mana costs.

Comment a simple Champion concept of your own, God knows Riot could use some help making kits without 50 different mechanics mashed into 4 abilities and a passive. \n\nThey're pretty good at it, actually. We're recently seen more complex champions, yes, but they're much simpler than most people seem to think. Ekko, for example, actually DOES have a pretty straightforward kit: he just has a lot of gameplay options to how he USES the kit. That's pretty much the definition of good champion design.\n\nAnyway...\n\n> **Passive- Arc-charged Arcana**\n> Tezz&#039;s abilities deal 1% more damage for each 5% health the affected target has.\n\nThis makes it really hard to tell the amount of damage you're going to deal to any one target, which is a little odd. Not a dealbreaker though.\n\nAn odd ability for a guy with only one targeted ability.\n\n> **Q- Static Bolt**\n> _Cooldown_ 9/8/7/6/5\n> _Cost_ 55/65/75/85/95\n> _Range_ 550 \n> Tezz  fires an arc of static which instantly deals 40/80/120/160/200 (+80% AP) to target enemy.\n\nThis ability is incredibly boring: it's a point-and-click repeatable damage spell with no interesting interactions with any part of his kit. There's no decision making to make anywhere, no skill required of either the user or the target, nor any pattern that leads to interesting gameplay (unlike Veigar, Annie, or old Ryze).\n\nRemember: Simple =/= Boring.\n\n> **W- Ride the Lightning**\n> _Cooldown_ 18/16/14/12/10\n> _Cost_ 100/110/120/130/140\n> _Blink Range_ 220/260/300/340/380\n> Tezz Blinks a short distantce. His next ability within 3 seconds will stun damaged enemies for 1.25 seconds.\n\nBetter. It's probably fine to simply scale the cooldown and not the blink distance itself: for the sake of both Tezz and his enemy it's best to have the distance he covers with his engage / escape be relatively predictable.\n\nThat said, I'm not sold on the effect: you're always going to want to use this with your E for multi-stun procs (as written), or always with your R if E doesn't work that way.  The lack of damage also makes Tezz have a pretty small focused damage contribution overall.\n\n> **E- Discharge**\n> _Cooldown_ 15/14/13/12/11\n> _Cost_ 70/75/80/85/90\n> _Cast Range_ 1900/2200/2500/2800/3100\n> Target area is hit randomly with 12 bolts of lightning, 3 per second, each dealing 25/75/125/175/225 (+20% AP).\n\nFirstly, this is a potential 2700 + 240% AP damage DoT on a non-ultimate ability. Think about that for a second!\n\nSecondly, and almost more important, is that League is strongly moving away from randomized effects. Take a look at this ability as an example: your single-target damage over 4 seconds (assuming 400 AP) is somewhere between 0 and 3660. You have a single ability with a damage range larger than most mage's full burst combo at full build.\n\nThirdly, the enormous cast range, long duration, low cost, and unknown AoE radius make this ability way too potent a zoning and harassing tool.\n\n> **R- Electrosurge**\n> _Cooldown_ 130/115/110\n> _Cost_ 120\n> _Surge Range_ 1200/1600/2000\n> Tezz unleashes a wall of electricity which roils forwards, dealing 210/420/640 (+90% AP) to all enemies it passes through.\n\nEh. AoE damage ultimate. Not much to say here.\n\n--------------\n\n#CLOSING THOUGHTS\n\nYou seem to be laboring under the impression that **Simple kit == No kit interactions or unique elements.** That's not really a good idea: it gets us results like this, which do basically nothing but damage, damage, and more damage in ways that are largely independent of player skill. Even simple existing kits like Jarvan IV, Katarina, Master Yi, Annie, or Wukong have choices and decisions to be made in playstyle, or opportunities to display your skill with the champion.\n\nTezz doesn't, really. Use Q on a target whenever you can, use W+R when you have targets, drop E over opponents. Anything else is pretty much the wrong decision, and he contributes nothing but damage until the W+R stun combo, making him play second fiddle to pretty much every mage who can bring more to the table.\n\nDon't fret it to much though -- I think you can fix most of these problems by realizing that simplicity doesn't equate to a lack of gameplay options, and seeing where on his kit you can add depth while retaining simplicity.\n\nAfter all -- some of the best designs are **Low Skill Floor, High Skill Ceiling**. Easy to play, yet hard to master.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lollop Ladies","date":"2015-07-06T22:14:34.652+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"new champion thats just a mimic chest pls","replies":[{"poster":"IMspartagus","date":"2015-07-06T22:17:36.581+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"make it and post it here.

Otherwise you can w at fountain. Walk into lane, stun with q, insta-w, stun with e and auto-delete enemies. It also takes away one of the key balancing points about his crazy high damage kit (in order to cc he has to use his escape) as he can just w under tower to get a stun-charge and wait for cd to come back up before trading next. Don't even get me started to what he could do with a double-proc like that if he was jingle-jangling. Kind of similar to back when Master Yi's double-strike was just every 7th strike with no timer and he'd come out of the jungle with way too high amounts of burst.","replies":[{"poster":"Duko","date":"2015-07-06T08:27:03.826+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh yah I see that.
