Before we investigate into your route, we'll need to ensure local network settings aren't exacerbating this issue. I strongly recommend working through the steps in our [connection troubleshooting guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) as a first step.\n\nLet me know if those steps caused any positive change to your latency.","replies":[]},{"poster":"UghThatGuyAgain","date":"2016-10-06T01:48:09.514+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ping is usually based on your own internet, however, sometimes the Riot servers do tend to have their problems. Make sure that you have nothing that would be taking up a ton of your bandwidth before you play (I.E. Streaming services such as Twitch or Youtube, any sort of download, etc). These can cause major ping spikes, from experience on my side. Check to see if anyone else is on your internet at all, as they could be doing something.\n\nOn the other hand, looking at another post from the support section, other players are having the same issue, so it's very possible that the Riot servers are having troubles with something right now. Keep updated with other posts to see what's up and to see if anything that was posted could help you out.","replies":[]}]}
