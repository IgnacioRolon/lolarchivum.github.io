I haven't played in over a year or longer maybe since I think last time was season 4? Anyways, I want to change my password and update my email and password to match my current stuff that I use since that was a long time ago.\r\n\r\nI know past password changes I have made, I know I have spent well over $1000 on this game because I was OBSESSED with skins and collected them.
