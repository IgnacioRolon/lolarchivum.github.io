My internet speed is solid, when I download games on steam I get around 10 MB/s. It started when I moved back to my apartment after the holidays and nothing changed that I  know of while I was gone. Another symptom I get is I have trouble watching video streams like on twitch.tv. I think they may be related but I am unsure.\r\n\r\nI have all the latest drivers, I have a gtx 770 and an i7 4770 with 16 gb of RAM. \r\n\r\nAny help is appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-13T23:06:35.150+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"It sounds like you've got either a week connection or some issue that's not communicating information back and forth smoothly.
