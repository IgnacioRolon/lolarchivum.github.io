This will mean that even if someone cracks the password to your email in an attempt to steal your League account, they'll need to access the phone you associated with your email to gain access.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions.","replies":[{"poster":"XD haha","date":"2016-10-24T05:11:27.881+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hello dear Rioter, \nI find this person's story to be extremely suspicious and fishy.
