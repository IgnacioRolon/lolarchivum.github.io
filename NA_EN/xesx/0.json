HOLY CRAP I CANNOT BELIEVE IT!! THIS MADE MY YEAR!! I LOVE YOU GUYS, SEE YOU ON THE RIFT!!!!!!!\n\n\nORIGINAL BOARDS POST, WHERE I RECEIVED NO HELP: https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/F2EgtWys-im-perma-banned\n\nEDIT:I have filled out a support ticket for my situation prior to making this post.\n\nSo, in about october of 2016 i decided to play league and figured out that my password was changed. I filled out the support ticket, got my account back from the hacker, ect. Ect. Well, the hacker spent $90 of rp on my account, keep in mind, it was already on my account before i regained access to it, I did not buy it, infact, it was already used. I went to my rp purchase history and it says 90 bucks. Well fast forward a few months and I have no internet because my family has been going through some hard times with money; so we could not afford it for about 4 months. Well I just tried to log into my account today for the first time in 4 months and it said I am permabanned.... No reason, just to check my email.\nI rummaged through my emails and found out that I have been banned for a chargeback, my first reaction was \"what is going on, whats a charge back!\" I read it and then I was even more confused than I was before. I owe riot $40? What?!? I didn't do anything. I was hacked and the hacker spent money, I didn't do it. The only thing I can think of is that the hacker spent money on MY account, and then I regained access, changed my password, and then he got pissed and went to his bank and demanded a chargeback; saying I stole it or something. I am scared for my account, i have been playing for 4 years and have put blood, sweat, and my social life in this account. I cannot fathom it being perma banned! Tears were shed whenever I seen this message pop up. How could this be happening? I didn't do anything and I am being punished? This can't be true! I am honestly considering taking the hacker to court for this. Not even joking. I have grounds for it. I really hope riot can sort this out, because that is my last resort option.\n\nFINAL EDIT: Just so everyone knows, I am still fighting this battle with Riot to get my account back. They do not care about their players. They just care about money and their own reputation. I would really recommend any new players to stop playing and chose a different MOBA. Riot will not stick up for you, Riot will not help you, and Riot will not assist you when they ban you; even if it was wrongful. I have made over 4 support tickets, and it is just taking a piece of me with them, every single time I send one. I do not know what to do anymore. I offered to help Riot with finding the hacker that did this to me, so he cannot do it again, but they gave no definite answer. I am just so sad that this could happen and Riot did nothing to help. I figured they cared more about their community. I guess I was wrong to think that they would care about their money slaves. I do not even care about insulting them anymore, they gave me a big gigantic \"Fuck You!\" in each of the support tickets I have sent. I have been nothing but polite to them, but I still have yet to get a reasonable person to talk to. I am hoping someone can help me with this, I am on my last leg here. Anyone.....anyone who can help me, please contact me at LeagueRocks1991@gmail.com. Ironic, I thought that it rocked at the time I made this Gmail account. I guess I was wrong all along.","replies":[{"poster":"Xesx","date":"2017-04-03T23:36:48.741+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"RIOT HAS UNBANNED MY ACCOUNT, AND I COULD NOT BE ANY MORE HAPPIER!

It looks like someone was able to answer your ticket, and tried to proceed with account recover but you never responded. It looks like that ticket has closed now, but if you reach back out to us we'll be able to look into that chargeback for you and see if that lines up with your account being compromised. \n\nReach out to us through our [**Account Recovery Form**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=72416) and we'll be able to sort this out!","replies":[{"poster":"Xesx","date":"2017-04-02T05:57:17.165+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for taking the time out of your day to reply to me, I really appreciate it!
