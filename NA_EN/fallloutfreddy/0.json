So now i have a 20 minute wait timer for five games and on top of that I am waiting near 7 minutes to get into a game. All for something that really shouldnt be punishable. Its not like i left my teamates on purpose and said good luck. Thanks league, way to keep this game great.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-09T22:08:54.972+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"The leaverbuster system will only place you in a lower priority queue only after multiple leaves and not just one.  Even if you return to the game, there is still a period of time when the match is down a player and that causes a negative experience.  The only way to return to good standing would be by playing consistently without issues.  Let me know if you have any issues that's keeping you from staying in-game, and I'm happy to help!","replies":[{"poster":"fallloutfreddy","date":"2016-09-10T06:06:08.427+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What about if we win the game....so yea bad start but we win the game, how is that a bad experience. Riot is so concerned with peoples feelings that this game has become like a government. If you offend someone then they report and you get chat filtered. Which if this is the case why even have a mute button, not like people use it anyway. People need to learn how to take smack talk or deal with cruddy teamates. You dont see Call of Duty banning people for talking smack or sucking at the game or leaving games. Because people need to learn to deal with it. Its called life. This community is so toxic, and riot handles it horribly. Try reviewing individual cases of extremes rather than giving extreme punishments.","replies":[]}]}]}
