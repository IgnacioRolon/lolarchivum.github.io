This is Colonel k1 and I am currently forming a new League team. As of now the team has no name; that will be decided later on. To cut to the chase, the purpose of this team is to win worlds. This team is looking for highly skilled players who have their **PRIMARY **goal as winning World Championship 2016 and being the best League of Legends team on the planet. Not financial rewards, fame, streaming full time, etc. If one of these goals or something similar is your primary one, this team is not the best fit for you. Our team is looking for individuals who take both wins and losses as a learning opportunity. Individuals who always look to improve at League of Legends and who make no excuses. \n\nTeam goals are as follows:\n•\t#1 on Ranked 5v5 Ladder before January 21, 2016\n•\t#1 during Regular Season AND Playoffs NACS Spring 2016\n•\t#1 during Regular Season AND Playoffs NALCS Summer 2016\n•\t#1 @ LoL World Championship 2016\n\nWe understand that the goals are set high; however, the team has to get used to placing first in preliminary competitions if we are to have ANY chance on the World’s stage against top teams from other regions. We will have to outwork all of our competition, including the top teams in Korea/China and their bootcamp style training regimens. Team members will practice at their current location until the team achieves #1 on the ranked 5v5 ladder. Team management is looking for potential sponsors for a gaming house and related expenses, and once our team proves itself by qualifying for the NACS, we will move to the house ASAP. Our players will have to be completely in sync with one another, and for that we need to understand each other on a personal level, facilitated by the gaming house. Current top NA teams are known for doing well in the LCS, but not known for winning at worlds. Our team will be no different if we do not take on the necessary work ethic to outperform the competition. \n\nRequirements for joining:\n•\t**CURRENTLY** Challenger/Master Solo Que **OR** Challenger Ranked 5’s and Diamond 4+ Solo Que\n•\tAge 17 by January 2016\n•\tMust live in North America, fluent in English preferred\n•\tAble  to move to a gaming house in California, USA ASAP after qualifying for the NACS\n•\tAble to work well in a team environment and communicate effectively through voice chat\n•\t**STAYING COMMITED** to League for the next year. This means:\n      o\tYou are comfortable playing/watching/discussing League 10+ hours a day\n      o\tYou LOVE League of Legends and think about the game regularly\n      o\tYou watch replays, pro matches, theorycraft, **PRACTICE** until perfection\n      o\tYou THRIVE on high level competition, addicted to winning\n\nDo you love competition? Will you dedicate your life towards League for the entire next year? Will you work towards being THE BEST at your role bar none? Will you outperform Faker, Imp, Madlife in lane or Clearlove in the jungle if it comes down to it? If the answer is yes, we would love to have you on the team.  My IGN is Colonel K1 and I currently am the GM, Coach, and Analyst for the team, with special emphasis on coaching/strategy. When we find success on the ladder and the NACS, we can delegate responsibilities further in accordance to the official LCS rules. You can reach me at colonelk11@gmail.com with further inquiries, or to send me your resume. I will contact you personally, both in-game through a friend request and through e-mail, after you apply and I review your information. Then we can schedule an interview accordingly. Thank you all for reading this, and have a wonderful day.\n\n**APPLY HERE:**  \nhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/1_bQ_prbMywAncXzycBXOpWg8VzhCCuZJkDNlV5fZUEk/viewform\n\n**IF THE FORM SHOWS UP ON THIS PAGE, USE TAB TO SCROLL THROUGH**","replies":[{"poster":"Man In Sky","date":"2015-11-05T04:21:00.549+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Winning worlds?
