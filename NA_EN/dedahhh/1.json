On 7.17 I consistently had 59 ms. But ever since the update my ping has been hovering in the 80s and it is nearly unplayable for me. The slight delay just makes the game not fun and stressful to play. Just wondering if this is fixable or if anyone else has had ping issues since the patch. I will probably just uninstall if there's nothing I can do because 85 ping is not fun to play on...","replies":[{"poster":"DIΟGO","date":"2017-10-12T14:28:43.586+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Still having this issue since patch 7.19","replies":[]},{"poster":"øutside","date":"2017-09-13T20:12:09.306+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same, my ping is up from 37 to 57, really bothering me.

A few patches ago my ping raised from 47 to 59. But that was fine with me. But after this patch it randomly is up in the 80s. Way to high for me lol. Probably wont get an actual response from riot unless it's a troubleshoot link or something that isn't gonna help","replies":[{"poster":"øutside","date":"2017-09-13T21:24:45.479+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mine is back to normal now.
