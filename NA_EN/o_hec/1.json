Unfortunately, even after taking all action available to me, the fix was partial short-lived.\r\nI love this game, and I want to continue playing it, but when myself and many of my friends encounter these random crashes and seemingly unbeatable problems, we start getting apathetic.\r\n\r\nSome info:\r\n-I play on Mac in Full screen mode usually at medium graphics with shadows off (my friends use similar settings on PC)\r\n-As I said these problems started only after patch 7.23, so Im inclined to believe its a Riot-side issue \r\n-Ive used the full repair tool in the client, reinstalled the game manually, deleted certain files at the recommendation of a support rioter, used the Hextech repair tool to send support my game info (found nothing) and force reinstall client and force re-patch\r\n\r\nPlease help! I want to play my favorite game with my friends!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-15T04:46:45.845+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah dang, I'm sorry to hear our techs were able to help but then the problem seems to have come right back. I went ahead and pulled up your old tickets to see what steps you've tried and what seemed to work, and it sounds like ol' Rufio suggested playing in borderless mode to have more stable gameplay. Has borderless mode made it start crashing again? \n\nI want you to go ahead and try running a quick repair as well, but make sure you do so with an ethernet connection if at all possible! Sometimes the game files can go a little wonky for a large number of reasons, and it's always good to make sure they're still intact and working properly first.","replies":[{"poster":"o hec","date":"2017-12-16T00:43:05.405+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately I can't play in borderless mode, there are about 2 inch margins at the edge of the screen that allow for accidentally clicking off the page (Used to use borderless before the change to this)\n\nIll try running another repair, but I believe I've done about 3 in the past 2 weeks, Is there any other possible action? could it be a problem with my account itself?","replies":[]}]}]}
