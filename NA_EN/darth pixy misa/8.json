You don't see the glory that is Blind Pick 5th games. The only way to get to them is to have each team go 2:2 (duh), which makes the match a best of one. Your favorite format from the LCS that shows true skill. \n\nNow they take that Best of One and they beat it with a stick because who needs pesky Bans. The LCK format for Blind Pick is amazing. It puts the entire team on what they are comfortable with, with a team comp they are most familiar with and champions they dominate with.\n\nJust because one player in the world can play a champion at such a level that he could probably 1v9, does not mean you have to call 5th Game Blind Pick a \"retarded\" Pick. \n\nThat is rather rude, considering that all players are given the opportunity to play their \"best champion\". There is the counter play its called hope to hell you can be on the level to at least compete with Faker. \n\nFaker has 2000+ games on Leblanc. He is a literal god with that champion, and I see no reason a 5th game Blind pick shouldn't be encouraged. \n\nIt's like God Support (when he was at his pinnacle) Madlife not getting Blitz or Thresh. I want to see the best games and by god if that means giving Faker Leblanc I'll see it!","replies":[{"poster":"JevelFaithful","date":"2015-05-01T21:51:18.659+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's it, those games are always epic.

What I should say is that TSM was able to defeat multiple Asian teams without any problems... including ones that beat Korean teams.  I am not entirely sure if they played vs Korean teams exactly however the logic remains is that Korean teams got wiped in IEM, and likely because there was no \"Game 5 blind pick\" mode either.\n\n\nSpeculation, yes, but we will find out soon enough.//","replies":[{"poster":"Vixanys","date":"2015-05-05T01:57:02.058+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"My poor poor naive friend, if you watched LCK on a regular basis you'd see that most playoff games rarely go to 5th pick. Its the times it does, where the match boils down to a best of one. Now, just thinking of it. Both teams have fought 4 games dead even in the standings, and pow 5th game is upon them, No Bans Blind pick is here. Play who you want. They can't take your strategies away just try to counter them. After 4 grueling games, a 5th game to bring some diversity in a meta that may not favor it, it's a hell of an idea.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JevelFaithful","date":"2015-05-05T22:39:21.645+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd stand with vixanys on this one. Overall, of the 2 korean teams, GET made it to the playoff. And CJ entus won 1 before being eliminated by the winner, and then by the second place (all that in Bo1). Overall, 1 korean got cleaned up pretty quickly in Bo1 and the other made it to the first round of Bo3. \nBo5 rules never came into play in that, taht's why I'm kind of surprised you blame them on relying on it. Somehow, I doubt they would have even made it there if they won because of blindGame5.  \nLike Vixanys says.

In the case of Faker he is undefeated when he gets Leblanc. It doesn't matter there appears to be no counterplay to him on that champion. That can be counter-intuitive to a competitive game style, but on the other hand, each team gets there best champions and best comps, so there should be a balance to it.\n\nI wouldn't go as far to call anyone an idiot for their opinion.

My response might have been a bit too impulsive. \n\nAnd yeah, in theory, no champion would be 100% pick or ban (like a good Leblanc in your example), but League has some issues with this.  And the blind-game5 is technically a non-sense from a purely competitive standpoint (nowhere else do you see this and there is no reason to differenciate Game5).  I think in the end, the main advantage is for the viewer. I know I can't keep my concentration for 4h straight of League. So a change of pace is pretty much mandatory. That or make finals in Bo3. Maybe with a double elimination to avoid too many upsets.\n\nADDED : Actually, know what? I'll correct you on one point. I wouldn't be calling him an idiot for his opinion. I would have been calling him an idiot for spouting his opinion when he has nothing substancial to back them on.
