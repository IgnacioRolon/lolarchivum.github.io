Dyrus as the main damage source early game? WTF, he runs NA top lane by picking big tanks and getting super tanky even after the enemy team has wasted 5 full minutes of game-time solely on ganking him. Santorin thought he had time to \"feel out the opponent\" and then react while every other jungler was controlling the pace themselves. Bjergsen.....trying to pretend hes good at everything. I'd honestly rather see Bjergsen just pick his Zed into this meta rather than try to Cho'gath ever again. I honestly believe Bjergsen would have done better on Zed based on natural skill, comfort and burst potential. Turtle tried to rely on Kalista with all attack speed build so he was a non-factor until the super-late game that they never got to. And Lustboy didnt roam to set things up. He just looked for picks into stronger teams.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MCBiggah99","date":"2015-05-08T21:47:41.457+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"It suited him when they played C9, lol.

They play much more aggressively, and are willing to make calculated riskier plays.  This in turn puts more pressure on TSM and lets them make more mistakes.  \nThis in contrast with NA where TSM's main competition, C9 play extremely safely.  They only go for a play if they're 99% sure it'll work. They go for low risk low reward plays which doesn't put nearly as much pressure on a team. This is why we see most games in NA where after 20 minutes there are less than 5 kills on the board.","replies":[{"poster":"Only Play Darius","date":"2015-05-08T22:29:14.764+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Would you say that the calculated, riskier plays are superior to NA's style of plays?","replies":[{"poster":"llamasx","date":"2015-05-09T01:21:57.153+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Jelly Mac,realm=NA,application-id=9hBQwnEU,discussion-id=8b8GPFX3,comment-id=000000010000,timestamp=2015-05-08T22:29:14.764+0000)\n>\n> Would you say that the calculated, riskier plays are superior to NA's style of plays?\n\nWell they certainly make the game more fun to watch.  As for actual outcome of the game, it goes both ways.  The way I see it is, there are only so many ways to play safe for a given team comp, which makes the team very predictable as they will pick the safer choice to get ahead 90% of the time.  \n\nOn the other hand, higher risk plays open a lot of doors to be less predictable so long as you're not making the same play over and over again (looking at Rush).  \n\nHonestly TSM should stick to their play style, but they're not reading their opponents correctly, which hurts their ability to make their safe choices which still being easy to predict.  They'd probably do better in a BO5 or if they managed to not get behind early/mid game as their controlled vision game is very good for staying ahead, just not good for getting ahead.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"PandahHeart","date":"2015-05-08T22:01:26.131+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MCBiggah99,realm=EUW,application-id=9hBQwnEU,discussion-id=8b8GPFX3,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-05-08T21:47:41.457+0000)\n>\n> It suited him when they played C9, lol.

I think I saw Santorin gank like once during the early parts of the matches. I think Cho is fine in NA but playing internationally, they need to do better. They even keep playing the same champions, like Santorin with Gragas and Wildturtl with Kalista. Ziggs is good for wave clear but I like him better when he plays Zed, Leblanc, Urgot or Ahri. And I feel like Santorin does better with Sej than Gragas or Reksai..","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"junglerboy16","date":"2015-05-09T01:55:41.397+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, Bjerg on anything really immobile actually has a tendency to not be nearly as amazing as his assassins, except for Azir.\n\nAccording to Faker though, NA midlaners are the best midlaners #FakerEpicTroll2k15.","replies":[{"poster":"grLKQ9ma0o","date":"2015-05-09T05:10:20.415+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"His Xerath is godlike, too.
