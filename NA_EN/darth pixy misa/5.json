MSI/Worlds this year will be (once again) Korea vs China. Fnatic and TSM will be competing for 3rd.\n\nThe current state of the teams I put TSM over Fnatic. That is clearly because of the performance Fnatic have shown versus what TSM has shown. I am no TSM Fanboy, which you can see pretty much on the forums, but they have the ability to survive Fnatic's early aggression and Bjerg can just dominate Feb.\n\nAt least they opened the prize pool to include 3rd and 4th place spots so NA/EU can get in on the moneys.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ganiklis","date":"2015-05-04T03:50:19.012+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hopeful for fanatic, could give a fuck less about tsm...and Im NA.

But I think it's a little more complicated than that. League is a team game and TSM \"asks\" Dyrus to sacrifice for the team.\n\nDyrus is not a carry top so he is asked to \"do the best he can\" with whatever they need for team comp (eg Lulu) so that Bjerg can carry, Turtle can clean up and Santorin can help Bjerg and Turtle do their things. This means that Dyrus is often left on an island to die 1v4 so that the team can win. And it works.","replies":[]}]}]}
