After I heard about the new changes, I decided to try the game again only to find that my account was not working. After a few days in contact with support they got my account back for me. I logged in and found that someone had been using it for a while, and that a lot has happened to the account. When I last played I had 13 skins and I was in bronze, but now there are over 300 skins and it is in gold. I am wondering if I should be worried at all about being banned for something they did on my account, or for anything. I did let support know about the money spent in case of chargeback. Is there anything else I should do?\n\nAlso, I looked through the purchase history and there are things from recently that show up there, but are not unlocked, like zoe and urfwick and the project mission icon. Is that from some kind of rollback on the account?\n\nJust curious if anyone else knows this stuff or has dealt with it.\n\nEdit: Actually, over 700 skins, I got the skin counter to actually work.\n\n[Skins...](https://i.imgur.com/E7iwUmc.png)","replies":[]}
