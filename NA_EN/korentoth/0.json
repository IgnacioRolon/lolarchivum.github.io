Color dots indicate which lane the voidlings will walk to.  Not all dots are within range of a turret.  Spawnpoints that I think should go to a different lane are circled in red.","replies":[{"poster":"Clopping Pony","date":"2015-02-04T11:02:39.980+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe they should allow you to reactivate the item in your inventory and click the tower you want it to target.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Decrit","date":"2015-02-03T22:27:14.195+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"+1 for the kda","replies":[]},{"poster":"aperson1","date":"2015-02-04T02:04:34.282+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah that bush in toplane annoys me so much haha. It would be the best spot to send voidlings to work on the inhib, but it redirects them mid instead. It's impossible to put the gate into a bush AND have the voidlings target the toplane inhib.","replies":[{"poster":"MysticKraken","date":"2015-02-04T18:31:58.621+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"theres a bush on the opposite of the top lane just above that tower. your argument is invalid. lol","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BeatzBoyFTW","date":"2015-02-04T11:02:08.626+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"FINALLY, some(thing) knows how to group mid & end game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"YOU BEEN WARNED","date":"2015-02-04T10:58:48.824+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Buff the item maybe? :(","replies":[]}]}
