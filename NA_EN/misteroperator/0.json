They concluded that the player base within the region was not large enough to support a dedicated server. However, recently eSports has boomed within South Africa, creating a sizable community wanting to play competitive games. A beloved game being League of Legends. The only problem is that playing on the EU West servers, we have a minimum of 200ms on a good day... This breeds a negative environment for competitive League of Legends within South Africa. Players have turned to less popular titles like CS:GO and DOTA 2 due to the fact that both titles have dedicated African servers and therefore no latency problems, creating a thriving competitive community. I believe that a revisit to the South African region would be conclusive to the need of a dedicated server. Rainbow Six Siege will soon be getting its own server here, and will more than likely see a positive response in South African playtime. \r\n\r\nLeague of Legends has a bright future within South Africa, but certainly the next step would be having your player's best interests in mind and implementing an African server. \r\n\r\n200ms just isn't cutting it.{{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}}","replies":[{"poster":"reba042","date":"2018-08-24T23:16:48.360+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"I bless the servers down in Africa.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Taxic02","date":"2018-08-25T11:12:04.610+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Notice how even people that aren't living in Africa think we should get a server.{{sticker:sg-lux-2}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kiniro Eulee","date":"2018-08-25T01:33:19.298+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"From NA but they should totally do this, let the world have no lag!","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheJabberwock3","date":"2018-08-25T09:30:01.681+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, playing from Africa with 300+ms is not fun...\n{{sticker:cass-cry}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Blåbæret","date":"2018-08-25T00:37:40.329+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kaale o ore mi!
