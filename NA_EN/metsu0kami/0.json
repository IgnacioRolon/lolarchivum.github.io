It is in good condition. But when I go into game i get random ping spikes out of nowhere and my champion sits in place while i can clearly see in real time that it looks like im playing 58/60 ping (my average ping) but in reality my ping says +200/+400 ping for no reason and i get killed because of that. i remember that when you dc for some reason your champion walks towards the fountain, THATs a good thing. What is NOT a good thing is to see my champion sit and get killed by the enemy champion with free kill. please riot, i know you guys worked hard on making the new client and i really do appreciated it. However, I would like this change to be put in ASAP for the random dc. DC in game is never a good thing but don't make it so that the enemy champion gets a lead from dc in place as soon as you reconnect, its really unfair and i would hope that riot does see this because some people can't afford good pc to run this amazing game. but i hope this small issue can be sorted out and things in the future of solo queue games get better. small glitches for dc like this should be fixed, period. Thank you\r\n\r\n-Metsu0kami{{champion:497}}","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-30T03:36:06.824+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If your ping is hovering around 60 but you can tell that your ping must be around 200-400, you might actually be having some packet loss issues as opposed to a regular connection issue. Packet loss is essentially when some of the data going between your network and our servers gets lost along the way. We can know for sure by grabbing your latest game logs and throwing them into our [**log reader**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743). That will let us know what kind of ping you really had, and if you had any packet loss.","replies":[]}]}
