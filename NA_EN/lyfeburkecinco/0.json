Such panels are available in-game, but not in replays.\r\n7) There is literally no way to see how much gold each champion has.\r\n8) Setting the vision mode to show you the vision of a specific team is INCORRECT. If their jungler is fighting a jungle minion, and that jungle minion walks into a bush, they can still briefly can see the minion in the bush, and therefore they continue to auto attack it... but in the replay, what you see is that the minion instantly disappears the moment it walks into the bush, so they appear to be attacking something that they cannot see. But actually, they could still see it. So what this means is, the replays are using a different or out-dated vision algorithm.\r\n9) Cannot see emotes in replays.\r\n10) Setting the vision mode to a specific team, does not prevent you from seeing the yellow dots disappear as the enemy clears their side of the jungle, which really is a spoiler because then I can&#039;t keep track of which camps my client knew were cleared on the enemy side.\r\n11) Setting the vision mode to a specific team, does not prevent you from seeing the other team&#039;s pings on the mini map, and this is a spoiler because I can predict what the enemy team is doing, whereas my client who was in the game could not see those enemy pings, so it&#039;s difficult for me to unsee those enemy pings so that I can accurately understand the way my client was thinking and making decisions.\r\n12) When you record a replay (to convert it into a *.webm video Highlights file), if you hit the pause button, it continues to record, and essentially it is recording a bunch of nothing. Please, make it also pause the recording when you pause the playback.\r\n13) Recording a replay to a *.webm file only records the first ~60 seconds of audio. After that, there appears to be no audio in the file. \r\n14) Playback of full game-length *webm files in various different video players fails with errors in various spots in the videos. I have recorded over 200 full game length webm files, so I should know. Windows Media Player will not play the videos, and neither will VLC media player. One of those players crashes at the start of the video, and the other always starts to have errors near the last minute of the videos. The only player that works is PotPlayer, which will play the entire videos without crashing, however even with PotPlayer the audio is still missing... only the first ~60 seconds of audio is played, and that&#039;s true no matter what video player is used.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Rapwnzel","date":"2018-03-28T20:15:45.247+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, thanks for taking the time to put this together and apologies for any poor experience that may have resulted from these issues.  \n\nReplays (and Spectator, for that matter) are interesting areas of the game because a variety of issues from a variety of features can surface/manifest here.  As such it can sometimes be more complicated than it should to track down and shepherd these sorts of Game Client issues to the proper teams.  Off the cuff I know some of these issues on your list are being looked at, but I will be happy to get the rest logged and shared with the appropriate teams to help resolve them.  \n\nI appreciate very much your focus on quality, and your time and effort raising visibility on these things.  <3\n\nCheers,\nJB","replies":[]}]}
