It said you won't be but I just wanted to make sure. Also, I put in a support ticket but they said use it at your own risk. Since I used real money in this account, I wanted to make sure and not use it if you can get perma banned for using a 3rd party software. Thank you for your response.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-24T22:36:01.528+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In general, we do not support any third party programs or mods.  Meaning, we can't provide tech support if something goes wrong or any malicious content that might be hidden in it.  I would advise using it, but as a rule of thumb, just be wary of anything that you think could give you a competitive advantage.  Check our [stance ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/225266848)on this here, and take caution.  Hope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"TCL Aspect","date":"2016-09-24T23:33:11.908+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In the website that I was thinking about using the Wooxy program, they had a picture of a Rioter saying that you guys allow Wooxy. But I wasn't really sure and they had nothing about getting perma-banned and what they were going to do. I don't think it gives me any advantage in any competitive way, just changing the looks of Summoner's rift and champions with custom maps/skins. This is why I was asking, to be extra caution about getting banned/suspended. Here is the link to the photo, if you don't believe me with the \"allowing Wooxy.\" Anyways, Thank you for all your work and responses :)\n\nhttps://mapskins.com/wooxy/wooxy-safety/","replies":[]}]}]}
