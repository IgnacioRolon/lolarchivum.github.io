Communication is 100% the most important thing in a **TEAM BASED STRATEGY GAME**, and not having a form of voice chat in a game is detrimental to that.

Solo players want to have the satisfaction of seeing where they stand in relation to other players in skill in an easily digestible way. If you get rid of solo queue you lose a substantial part of the player base because without that sense of achievement a lot of them lose motivation to keep playing. Many solo players also live in more isolated areas so don't have local friends to play with and don't really have interest in forming those kinds of ties online, some are actually incapable of doing so through circumstances beyond their control. Solo queue goes away, League most likely goes away, at least in NA. As a college coach your job might also go away.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Posui Gart","date":"2019-11-28T10:26:21.623+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Go find at least 1 player that didn't start league with solo queue.

I do agree that the game has shifted hard in general, even in organized play, to the only win condition that really matters most of the time is if you have the damage to end during the death timers after winning a single fight. Where as you used to see games end with both teams fighting it out at a nexus or base tower a lot more than a fast push, potentially through multiple towers, after a fight at baron or dragon pit any time beyond about 25-30 minutes.","replies":[]}]}]}
