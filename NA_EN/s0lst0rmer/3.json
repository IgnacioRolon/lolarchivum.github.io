Any dodges during promos instantly counts as a loss in your promos and can be the cause of you falling out of promos before qualifying again. Can you provide [an exact link](http://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/) to the match that you qualified for promos on?","replies":[{"poster":"S0LST0RMER","date":"2016-10-10T22:38:24.367+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"in the 2nd and 3rd imgur pics its the rengar win i hit promos on. i dunno how i can send a link or anything but look me up im m411solstormer on EUW","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-11T20:17:07.172+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I took a look at your account and it seems both times you entered your miniseries, the system registered a dodge, which counted as a loss and ended your series. \n\nIf these were unintentional dodges, let me know so we can investigate connection issues that could cause these to happen.","replies":[{"poster":"S0LST0RMER","date":"2016-10-13T17:14:16.026+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ah that could be it actually thinking about it now. usually when i minimise league it will pop up when i have a game or if its my turn to pick or ban but twice i remember it not popping up for a while and on opening i was at the start screen. kek","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"S0LST0RMER","date":"2016-10-10T16:46:22.013+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"btw the imgur pic is a bit cropped but there is a xerath win at the very bottom","replies":[]}]}
