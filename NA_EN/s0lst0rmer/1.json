However when i try to play on NA or Japan servers i get 200ms. Now obviously there is distance, however, i have seen streamers, typically pro&#039;s play on other servers just fine, for e.g. faker playing on EUW and NA or NA players playing on Korean servers.\r\nis there a way to play on these servers without getting insanely high ping?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-06T22:17:03.494+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There could be a few factors impacting your ping on different servers.  One would be the physical distance but your ISP could also be taking a long route from your location to our game servers, and making it longer to hold a steady connection.  \n\nIf you want to play on NA from EUW, you're going to have higher ping but you can at least make sure it's as strong as it can be.  I recommend using the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to tune up your network strength, but you can't exceed that physical distance.\n\nPlayers reaching servers from different continents are highly susceptible to ping issues, no matter who they are.  Let me know if that clears things up!","replies":[]},{"poster":"SuperEvilOllie","date":"2017-11-30T19:43:27.706+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i live in singapore but when i play on the NA server, i get 257 ping and OCE server, 109 ping. is there anyway i can improve my ping?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fast and Dumb","date":"2017-01-08T08:00:58.879+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's because Korea/Japan is too far from EUW, let's say that NA is the best place if you want to play on both Korea and EUW, for exempel you can say that NA is located in the middle: \n\nKorea > NA < EUW\n\nThis is very complicated so i try my best to explain,\nIf you play on NA from London your ping travel directly from EU to NA mean while EU to Korea it has to travel through NA and then Korea making it double the distance and not directly from EU to Korea, at least this what i think. If you want your ping to be lower you have to move closer to the server.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Decrit","date":"2017-01-06T22:51:12.776+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"*looks at your ping*\n\n*I look at my costant 85 ping*\n\n*cry in spaghetti*","replies":[]}]}
