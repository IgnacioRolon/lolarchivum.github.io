My poor teams that are unable to carry me. Every other time I get 40 ping. I am using fiber optic and I run speed test showing that I'm getting 100 mps and other games are at 40 ping at the same time. Does Nebraska get lower priority during prime time or what's going on?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-02T18:43:19.330+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with Khelb that getting some routing during this period can help a lot, and one during the off-time as well.  I'm guessing that your ISP might be changing how it's routing you to our game servers.

No ETA of the fix yet, but the support person helping me mentioned how important it is to have data.  That said, if you can run a WinMTR and post it here, i doubt it's going to hurt anything.\n\nEdit:  The host address I've been instructed to enter in WinMTR is 104.160.131.1","replies":[]}]}
