PROOF.","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] General Discussion","up_votes":6,"down_votes":52,"body":"Mogey (Riot Games Player Support)\n\nDec 6, 09:24\n\nHey Summoner,\n\nI&#039;m Mogey and I&#039;m here to take a look at your concerns. After looking into the account I determined negative experiences by intentionally feeding and griefing.\n\nFor example, I see a game as 0/4/0 as Tahm Kench in an effort to place your teammates in compromise positions and grief them. I see another 1/23/0 as Graves retaliating for having your role taken and intent to teach your teammates a lesson.\n\nRegrettably, we can&#039;t restore or reduce access to the account for any reason.\n\nLighting your path,\n\nMogey\nPlayer Behavior and Game\n&quot;All we have is somewhere to begin.&quot;\n\n\nThere you have it. I never trolled anyone, never lashed out, yet I was banned because I died a lot in a few games. This feeds toxcity. When people play this game. they have to pretty much play well and if they don&#039;t, they WILL become agitated and angry because they fear being banned and falsely accused of griefing when they just aren&#039;t skilled.\n\nThank you for showing your true colors Riot. Not only have you enforced the meta now, but any &quot;suspicious&quot; scoring will now be deemed guilty before being proven innocent.\n\nI was not given 1 ban or warning nor chat restriction prior to this. But a few games where I&#039;ve died a lot have given me a permanent ban. I want people that play this game to see this and to know that you have to play well on a consistent basis, or you&#039;re more threatening than trolls and ragers that tell others to end their lives.\n\nWell done Riot.\n\nEDIT. Look up my match history on LOLKing if you want. I don't mind.","replies":[]}
