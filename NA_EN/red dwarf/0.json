Can happen pretty much anytime in game. Seen others in game complaining of random ping spikes too so it is happening more and more to others who aren't on the same isp as me because i've asked them. anyone else with the same problems?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-06T21:36:25.266+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmmm if those ping spikes are *that* bad and happening so randomly, you may be dealing with some packet loss issues. It can sometimes be hard to deal with since it could actually be an ISP issue, but it's relatively easy to check for by using our [**log reader**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743). \n\nGrab some network logs from one of those games, and let that reader scan it. Take a screenshot, and post it here using something like Gyazo so I can go over it with you ^_^!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rave Riven","date":"2017-08-06T13:39:24.502+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I play from Israel, and my ping changes every single game. One game its 80, the next game its 90, and it does this every single game. This makes no sense unless the servers switch locations every time I go in a new game lmao. My ping used to be on 78 for a few good weeks but now the best I get is 80, there was also a month where I was on constant 100. I usually just blame my internet but it might be a problem with the servers, idk. \n\nRecently, in some games, my ping will jump to 2500 and wont go down for 3 (if im lucky) to 10 minutes. I wish my connection to TR was better but my routing to that server sucks, EUW is located 4 times further than the turkish server from me but because of the routing I have 138 ping on TR. I'd rather play on TR with under 50 ping with no English speakers than play on EUW with 80 one game, 90 another game, 2500 in the middle of the game sometimes.","replies":[]}]}
