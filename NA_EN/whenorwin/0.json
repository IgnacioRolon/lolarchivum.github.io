Here Is my story.","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"So here's my story, I was having a bad day and I ended up playing league of legends to get away from my real life problems. I had a very toxic teammate and I retaliated with my toxic retaliation as well. \r\nGame 1\r\nWhenorwin: I'll report\r\nWhenorwin: mb\r\nWhenorwin: bot lane/??\r\nWhenorwin: J4 7-1\r\nWhenorwin: wp\r\nWhenorwin: how is our bot lane so trash\r\nWhenorwin: when they don't even have a support\r\nWhenorwin: lol\r\nWhenorwin: wards?\r\nWhenorwin: i'm just going to split push\r\nWhenorwin: yall gl\r\nWhenorwin: i'm afk top\r\nWhenorwin: wish we had a jger\r\nWhenorwin: jax kys\r\nWhenorwin: you may have the kha but we have the most toxic jax \r\nWhenorwin: jax stfu\r\nWhenorwin: nad play\r\nWhenorwin: alrady\r\nWhenorwin: jax\r\nWhenorwin: play\r\nWhenorwin: nopob\r\nWhenorwin: jax\r\nWhenorwin: suck\r\nWhenorwin: cry so much\r\nWhenorwin: why are you so toxic\r\nWhenorwin: go eat a di ck\r\nWhenorwin: %%%g git\r\nWhenorwin: back up ?\r\nWhenorwin: so u ga y?\r\nWhenorwin: u no bakc up\r\nWhenorwin: u garbage\r\nWhenorwin: if u were good\r\nWhenorwin: we would ahve won\r\nWhenorwin: Reprot this jax?\r\nWhenorwin: toxoic\r\nWhenorwin: I report kha\r\nWhenorwin: reprot jax pls\r\n\r\nNow the following is what I said, I wish I had the amount of text the Jax said to me and the amount of annoying pings he did. Now I know I could have negated all of this by simply muting him but I didn't. And Now I'm suffering the consequence. This is my story and hopefully you guys learn from it. Do I regret any of it? Of course I do. But it is what it is sometimes.","replies":[{"poster":"Voidrendx","date":"2017-10-03T03:28:39.725+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dude youre just toxic theres no excusing that","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-03T04:35:40.585+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looks like there are a few rather toxic things you said in your own chat, and those punishments aren't placed with what the other person said in mind. Other's actions don't decide whether or not you get chat restrictions for something you said yourself.","replies":[]}]}
