Everything is red and blue and it almost looks like a 3-d movie.

It'll sometimes automatically turn on Stereoscopic 3D. You can solve this by following these steps:\n\n- Open the NVIDIA control panel\n- Navigate to the 'Stereoscopic 3D' dropdown on the righthand side\n- Click the 'Set up Stereoscopic 3D' and uncheck the 'Enable Stereoscopic 3D' box.\n\nOtherwise, you can do it in game by simply pressing CTRL+T to toggle Stereoscopic 3D. Thanks!","replies":[]}]}
