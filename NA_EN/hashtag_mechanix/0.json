The CDR and flat armor pen give her a ton of kill pressure before your opponent can build the armor to survive your level 6.  With runes, brutalizer, and ionians you get close to 40% CDR and hit your mobility cap very quickly which is very important.\n\nI think the only reason you would want to go BC is if you're in a matchup that you cannot snowball off of (such as Nasus) and you know you'll need the extra armor pen later on.  Otherwise Yoummus is a must buy.\n\nThe only other exception I can think of is maybe if you're against an AP top like Lissandra - the phage HP will help cut into her burst damage and the 20% CDR on cleaver will let you grab MR glyphs instead of CDR glyphs for laning.","replies":[{"poster":"FedAsFuk","date":"2015-04-29T21:21:50.106+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually hadn't thought about the impact of letting you bring MR glyphs and still hit max CDR, might have to try this","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"FedAsFuk","date":"2015-04-29T21:20:19.070+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Depends on the Riven. Friend of mine is big on the burst Riven (early Tiamet little or no CDR and stack damage skill order Q>W>E, basically BRNA style) where I play alot more CDR focused Riven. Using my utility for my impact, so I will be testing out TBC, but ghostblade is actually a good item on riven, it focuses on killing a squishy faster, which is your main goal. If you can't you become a flashy stun bot.\n\nThe only real difference now is that TBC now is not as easily attained for mega tanks, making Riven worse in tank lanes (Nasus for example) it will be a bit of an experiment for every Riven player. We will be seeing alot of different shit, personally I will be trying TBC rush in bad matchups that get tanky (Gnar, Nasus for example, sion to an extent).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hashtag Mechanix","date":"2015-04-29T17:15:44.828+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I understand what you're saying about the importance of CDR, and that being the reason why brut is such a strong rushed item for Riven.

It's a core item on her assassin build for a reason - it allows you to animation cancel much faster due to the attack speed which lets you assassinate your target in teamfights much easier, it allows you to split push turrets down faster, and it gives you the extra mobility that you often need to escape or chase when split pushing.\n\nI think even if you choose not to build yoummus then you still want the brutalizer though.  Sit on it til you're 6 items and sell it for a cleaver or BT then if you really hate the item that much.  By then you'll have enough pen from last whisper anyways.  If you choose to substitute it for something without CDR then you'll need to take 9 scaling CDR glyphs though.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Mirage Night","date":"2015-05-01T07:24:32.632+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have always played an out of the box style Riven, mainly speed Riven. I in essence I try to maximize both her cdr and movement speed. I do this in order to negate the need for flash to then maximize my dueling summoner spells. Granted it is inefficient, however I enjoy the play style.\n\nWith the new BC, this greatly improves this play style, all the while freeing out build paths I wouldn't have been able to take up til now.\n\nI typically will have 10% starting CDR with runes and masteries. And a mix of different rune setups depending on if I want early Pen/AD and Armor/Health\n\nEnd build will look something like this {{item:3071}}, {{item:3172}}, {{item:3009}}, {{item:3074}} or {{item:3072}}, {{item:3022}} or {{item:3156}} , {{item:3143}} or {{item:3026}} \n\n{{summoner:3}} {{summoner:14}}  typically for the dueling potential.

The new black cleaver is still a very useful item regardless of the fact that the recipe items are not as good as brutalizer. I suggest trying this: build your main dmg item before you build into black cleaver. The old black cleaver functioned with buying an early brutalizer and finishing the item after buying 1-2 more items. For the new black cleaver, it gives a big power spike when you finally finish the item. If you were playing a tankier AD champ, i'd recommend building into the recipe items earlier in the game.","replies":[]}]}
