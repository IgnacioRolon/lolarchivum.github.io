I have seen several people try to get Riot to fix it with absolutely no response. Therefore I found the need to try and help people with this instead of getting Riot to fix this. (Although it would still be greatly appreciated.) \n\nI and plenty of other League players have found that SEVERAL players have been using bots to supposedly get free IP from setting them up and letting them almost always lose the game for a team or give the enemy team some free gold and levels.\n\nI have found several tricks to tell if you are playing with a bot or not, and I would like to share them with fellow players assuming they haven't already found them themselves: \n\n*One way to tell if you are playing with a bot or not is to automatically ask your teammate at the start of a game if they are bots or not.\n\n*Another is that I have found Darius, Amumu, and several others are consistently picked to be played by bots.\n\n*I have also found that at the very beginning of a round they sometimes with B in spawn once, then will proceed with the minion waves.\n\n*Sometimes they will sit in a bush later game for the whole game and occasionally farm, making it easy for the enemy team to feed off of them.\n\n*They also usually pick Sprint and Heal at the start for their spells.\n\nThose are the main couple ways to tell if you are playing with a bot or not. I have found it much easier to play with a group of two or three people you do well with to eliminate the chance of playing with bots. I hope this guide was extremely helpful.","replies":[{"poster":"Zexarium","date":"2015-01-08T21:05:50.755+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really hope this did help guys!
