I don&#039;t think I&#039;m awful but obviously I&#039;m learning. I just got laid off and things haven&#039;t been great. I enjoy playing this game and it takes my mind off of things but then players are so mean sometimes. There is obviously friendly and helpful people and the honor initiative is great but I literally just left a game (I know that&#039;s not polite) because all 4 members were attacking me for my champion choice. I like a certain character and feel comfortable with her, why do people have to be mean? And now I will probably be in trouble for leaving but I wasn&#039;t about to spend 45 minutes being tormented by these people.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-10-12T23:23:29.362+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Welcome to free pvp games.\n\nfree pvp games attract bratty children.

But imagine when you do figure out how to jungle and the times you save someone's lane and pull off perfect ganks. That's the fun I'm talking about.
