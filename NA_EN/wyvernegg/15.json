Valor is her companion, just like Tibbers is with Annie. But we don't call them \"Quinn and Valor\" or \"Annie and Tibbers\" because they are the companions to the actual champions. They are part of them, but they aren't actually the champions themselves.\n\nKalista is Kalista. She is the manifestation of vengeance. People offer their souls to her in exchange for vengeance to be served upon the guilty. Kalista says \"we\" in reference to the souls of those who where betrayed, because she owns them and fights for them. She says \"we\" because she is driven by the desire for vengeance that comes from the souls of those she has collected. However, Kalista is still Kalista. She has control over herself, but in the lore it suggests that she is slowly losing herself, but the souls become one with her. She gains power, but she isn't becoming more than one person.\n\nKindred is different than both examples. Kindred is Lamb and Wolf. Kindred refers to both of them as one, because they are two halves of a whole entity. Referring to Kindred as \"she\" is entirely incorrect because Lamb isn't Kindred. Wolf and Lamb are Kindred. Do you control Lamb in game? Partially. If you notice in game Wolf has a specific position on the model during animations, so you control both. Lamb just takes over the auto attack portion of the kit. \n\nReferring to Kindred as \"she\" is wrong because Lamb isn't Kindred. She only makes up half of the whole entity. When you refer to Kindred, you refer to both of them, so they are \"them\".","replies":[{"poster":"WyvernEgg","date":"2015-10-20T20:10:33.179+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would like to add that even wolf auto attacks","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"WyvernEgg","date":"2015-10-20T16:17:59.133+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"My thoughts are that if you say kindred you're talking about both.
