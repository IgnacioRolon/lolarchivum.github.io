Please, if you are half a map away don't start pinging that you're coming in for backup while I'm fighting in a life or death situation. It's the difference between me going ham and investing everything into fighting and disengaging.\n\nThat said I would venture to guess that this is a thing that changes the higher elo you get. I would guess that the majority of people in plat+ keep a bit more awareness about their allies locations.
