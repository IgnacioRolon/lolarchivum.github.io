Rengar has to ult engage, so he goes for the leap, Xay waits for the engage then ults to negate one shot damage. Even if Rengar saves his kit so that it's not used on thin air, once Xay touches back down she can pull the feathers back for a stun then dispatch him easily as he's squishy. This is even more so with a Rakan for additional CC. The only plausible outplay would be to make sure Xay ult is on CD, or leap then sideways into a bush to dodge her feather pull and then to leap for the burst.","replies":[{"poster":"Sp33d Zer0","date":"2017-12-09T07:42:26.317+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You have to  time it really well to counter rengar's burst.

With average human reaction time being around .2 seconds average between audio and visual queues, that leaves you with AT MOST .3 seconds to hit R. Playing in NA on the west coast, I get 70 ping because of where the servers are. Put that together, that's roughly .2 seconds AT MOST to try to disengage it if he is jumping from the farthest possible point.","replies":[{"poster":"kargish","date":"2017-12-10T15:48:53.062+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As this is a game of milliseconds I'd say you got plenty of time to do something.
