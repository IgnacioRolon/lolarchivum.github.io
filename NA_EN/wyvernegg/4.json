I had the same issue at one point, I felt my self loose control of my anger bit by bit to the point that it turned to flat out depression every time I played the game. Look take it from me no mater how strong you are emotionally this place WILL break you eventually. Then again you might be stronger than me so the same rules might not apply. Still just remember leaving is always an option.","replies":[]},{"poster":"WhaiSoSerious","date":"2015-06-27T07:09:08.314+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Take a break. Honestly it's hard with all the trolls and jerks in this game. It's probably  not even \"toxxic\". Probably just people being a bunch of pansies and abusing the system.\n\nRight now this tribunal is all fucked up.","replies":[]}]}
