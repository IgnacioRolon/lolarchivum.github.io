If that doesn't work, it's possible that your Internet Explorers have gone wonky.  Try resetting your IE settings after logging out of the game, and clear out your cache and cookies.  The client uses IE, and can mess up if IE corrupts.  You may also need to update your IE.  Post back if you have any issues!","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2015-02-11T00:16:05.730+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just wanted to build off what Mogey Bear is saying.  A lot of store issues actually relate back to your Internet Explorer settings (if your using Windows OS).  I know that it sounds SUPER WEIRD that IE might be the root cause, especially if you never use it or avoid it like the plague.  Yet, it is a dependency for the League of Legends store.\n\nIf those steps don't work, make sure to check out or [Store Issues Article](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202536660-Issues-with-the-League-of-Legends-Store-PvP-Net-) on our Knowledge Base where you can find a variety of different steps that should resolve this black screen issue.\n\nIf your still unable to get it resolved, make sure that you [submit a ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) so one of our Tech guru's can work with you one-on-one to get this resolved ASAP!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Wolftrap","date":"2015-02-10T22:47:45.168+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've had this problem for 2 patches running now. They have a list of things you can try on the store but nothing has worked for me. It's pretty damn annoying I missed out on the entire mystery gift promo they had last month.","replies":[]}]}
