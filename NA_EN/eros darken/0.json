I still can't talk in-game voice chat. Clearly, either Riot doesn't care about Mac users ONE BIT or they work with 3rd party voice chat website to make us suffer. I have been using discord ever since the problem started, and you all know discord, continuously crashes. Either fix it or not, please give us an answer, don't just ignore us. Getting real frustrated.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-05-21T03:05:49.689+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> you all know discord, continuously crashes.\n\nIt does? Discord is probably the only complex program i have _never_ seen crash.\n\nThe sad truth is that nobody cares about OSX. Developing for it is much more difficult than for Windows or Linux, The number of users is very small, and only a tiny percentage of those are playing games on it. \n\nOut of that small group, almost everyone dualboots windows for gaming, making developing for mac even less logical. Games run far better in windows on a mac than they do natively, for the most part.\n\nAre you unable to dualboot for some reason, or just unaware of it?","replies":[]}]}
