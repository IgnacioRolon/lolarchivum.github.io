The game was frozen at the loading screen, so I restart the LoL Client to get in. I come back very behind and we lose. So what? It is a normal. I tried and did not harrass my team. We tried to work together but got overpowered by their Rengar. How in God&#039;s name does this earn a Leavebuster when I never LEFT?!\n\nDownvotes are fine.
