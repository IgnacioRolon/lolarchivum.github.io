I can watch everyone else move around and play but it will not allow me to move. My ping stays at a low 35, and the majority of the time it never even says reconnecting like i haven't been disconnected. Does anyone have any recommendations on how to fix this? I have called my isp and they believe they are not the issue so i don't know where to look.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-23T02:01:08.954+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Galacius has some good points!\n\nI wanted to add that it really sounds like you're having problems with some packet loss.
