Everyone is saying \"nerf zed\" when the only crazy good zeds are those pro players that would probably stomp you just as hard playing orianna. Orianna would just leave less of a directly visible impact because most of her kit is AOE and utility. Or those people that are only good at Zed, but they should be rewarded for champion mastery.\nPeople are just sad they can't survive the burst of a safe assasin.
