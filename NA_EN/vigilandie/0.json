I have to hard reset my computer, and I'm able to \"reconnect\" into the game with no problems, although usually the team asks for a remake so I don't get to reconnect. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling League but the problem persists. Any ideas on a fix?\n\nEDIT: tried to go into a custom game to see if I could change the graphic settings, client freezes upon spawning into custom games as well...","replies":[{"poster":"Zoshiro","date":"2016-09-24T06:41:06.802+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have disabled the bar, and I am still getting this stupid error.

If you're on 10, I suggest [disabling the game bar](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html) to see if it resolves the issue.\n\nLet me know if this helped out!","replies":[{"poster":"vigilandie","date":"2016-09-24T00:40:47.569+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry for the late reply, I didn't realize people commented!

I did recently get a Windows 10 update so If you could tell me how to even open it up in the first place would be very helpful thanks.","replies":[]}]}
