I have absolutely no idea what the problem is, I used the hextech repair tool to uninstall and reinstall the game, forced a repatch, still didnt work. Then did the \"clean\" uninstall and reinstall, but didnt force a repatch. The launcher doesnt seem to be patching itself after it finished installing again. I cannot run the repair tool either, I click on it and nothing happens.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-29T22:48:35.827+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This issue specifically happens if your connection to the login servers is *really unstable*. Common reasons for this are either problematic local network settings or issues along your network routing.
