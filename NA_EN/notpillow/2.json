Basically, I launch the league launcher, click launch, and nothing happens. I cant repair it either, I click repair and nothing happens. It takes many tries and relaunching the launcher and thousands of button presses to get the login screen to come up. Ive contacted support about this before and fixed the issue for a bit, but soon the problem came back. Can I just get a link to download the alpha client launcher? That actually worked for me unlike the legacy launcher.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-16T04:38:10.293+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can actually upgrade to the Beta Client at any time from the Legacy Patcher, as shown in the screenshot below:\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/GbgFI\n\nIf that doesn't end up causing any changes for you, let me know so we can work on troubleshooting this.","replies":[{"poster":"NotPillow","date":"2017-02-16T08:07:44.264+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ive tried many times to download it from the legacy client, and sadly it hasnt worked for me.

I click on the \"Upgrade Now\" button in the popup screen every time I reinstall league, which Ive done many times now in an attempt to fix the problem, and it says thank you for joining or whatever it says I cant remember at the moment, then nothing happens at all. If its of any help, when I click on the \"League Client Update Open Beta\" screen you outlined in the picture you sent, its very slow to pop up.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-19T22:43:04.488+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright, it sounds like something is interfering with the upgrade. The first thing you want to do is *temporarily disable* any Firewall or Antivirus programs you may be running. After that, you'll want to hop into your League installation, which should be here:\n\n> **C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends)**\n\n**DELETE** the *LeagueClient.exe* file and then launch League from the **lol.launcher.admin.exe** file as admin (right-click, *run as administrator*) to attempt the upgrade process again. You're free to re-enable your Firewall or Antivirus afterward.\n\nPlease let me know if this resolved your issue.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"ChrissyCakes","date":"2017-02-18T00:10:15.172+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This has also happened to me!
