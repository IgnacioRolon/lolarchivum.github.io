However, I do not experience the same problem when i use the Alpha client. I would prefer to use the Legacy client though because the Alpha client runs incredibly slow on my low-end laptop.

When you have issues connecting to it, it's usually caused by an overall poor connection to our servers.

However, I downloaded your helpful little Hextech Repair Tool, and had it reinstall the game. That did fix the problem, and I am able to use the Legacy client again. Cheers!","replies":[]}]}]}
