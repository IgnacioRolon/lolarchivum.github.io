Some players are cool-headed and able to take criticism. But that's a small minority! \nMaybe 80% of the league community is made of crybabies. At the smallest sign of judgement, they crumble. Anytime someone is assertive and strong-minded, they feel threatened.\nLook at the board : criticise something and you'll have swarms of riot fans trying to belittle you with insults. That's not debate. Debate is exchanging ideas. That's hysteria... Fuelled by a fragile ego.\nAnd riot promotes this.\nThey have developped all the tools and rhetorics to encourage kids throwing tantrums : censoring chat, banning people for \"negativity\"... NEGATIVITY! Imagine people who cannot play a video game because they feel negatively judged!

But riot encourages the exact opposite : they will let people trash games pretty much forever, but call them out and you're banned in 2 games. They are not following their rules at all.\nEx? You can ban a champion picked by someone. you can troll pick braum top, sona jungle. You can first time a champ in ranked. All of this is clearly damageable to teamplay. But riot is totally fine with this. But call people \"lucky\" a bit too much, spam \"ez\", and you get banned.\nAs you said, we come to play a game and win. Riot should focus mainly on the gameplay, and the social part should be secondary. But it's the opposite.\nImagine if your electricity, water, or healthcare provider, failed to provide the service you paid for, but they sacked \"toxic\" people, so you cannot get a refund?\n\n> Banter is fine, but no, threatening others is not ok in this game. It may be fine between friends, but realize you're playing with others in game who may not agree with that.\n\nRiot is legally allowed to set their rules, but I've played multiplayer video games for decades (yes, decades) and insults have always been part of the fun. If things ever turn violent in reality (which is unlikely to happend with lol), then it's the police's job. Just like I wouldnt expect my phone company or my football club to ban people for \"negativity\" when no legal complaint has been filed.\n\n\n\n","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ChaosLordMadis","date":"2019-06-23T21:14:43.626+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":2,"body":"Most people do not give constructive criticism.......","replies":[{"poster":"Phieldworker","date":"2019-06-23T21:37:52.490+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is true. “You suck” is not constructive. \n\nConstructive would be the bot feeling 10 kills and you saying “ let’s band together and when a fight comes focus Draven because he’s fed”.

This is just my opinion, but there is quite an issue with victim mentality, as well as simple inability to take criticism. When I say that though, I also have to say, in order to differentiate this claim from yours, that there's a very specific set of \"rules\" to classifying someone as a self-made victim. Firstly, your criticism needs to be and *must be* constructive and assertive in order to make that assumption.\n\n- \"Nunu, you need to ult sooner.\" Constructive, direct, clearly outlines what you believe is their best course of action. Not aggressive or hostile, but still declares the message you wish to convey - ult sooner, and we have a better chance to win.\n- \"Nunu, wtf?! use your fucking ult! *spam ping ult CD is up*\" Hostile, aggressive, overall negative. Still direct, still outlines what you think is best...but in such a way that you clearly are clearly displaying contempt of your teammate.\n\nSecond, if they become hostile after this, you need to hold your constructive yet assertive stance, and not fight flame with flame. In fact, you don't want to fight at all. Say your piece, and be done with it. If they get hostile, honestly, just keep playing the game and don't bother with them. If you need to repeat that same piece of criticism over and over again after like every other fight, whatever, but the moment you deviate to matching \"fuck off noob, reported\" with snarky, passive-aggressive comebacks based around what you said and what you see as lack of skill, you're playing chat wars, not LoL.\n\nLastly, you need to accept that *you could be wrong*. In my previous example...if I tell Nunu to ult sooner, and he starts trying to ult sooner, only to get immediately cc'd and pubstomped, I cannot keep putting that blame on Nunu. I mean, I literally *just* told him to ult sooner in fights, and he even tried to oblige. This does not make it a \"welp, gg, fucking Nunu\" game. If anything, if I were to actually believe that's the case, **I** would be the one playing victim, in saying \"oh, I lost the game cause teammates!\" when in reality, my teammates were trying their best and even *listening to me*. It's possible that the reason for a loss is as simple as \"we got fucking rekt.\" It doesn't have to be \"this guy didn't play correctly.\" As many people who play victim as there are, there's just as many who *must* make a *culprit* to feel better, which is just as bad.\n\nIf they are playing the victim, it royally sucks. And it's still a much higher statistic than it should be. But it's actually much lower than you think it is. The issue is that there's not a straightforward way to combat it. At least, not individually. So even though it's definitely something that can be *established*, there's not really a good answer to \"what the hell can we do about it?\" at this time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Imperial Pandaa","date":"2019-06-24T12:42:16.061+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Funny you should mention debate, because it goes both ways.
