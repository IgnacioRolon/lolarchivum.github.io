She has literally everything and seemingly no weaknesses. Escape? Check, Zone control? CHECK, huge range, great synergy with hurricane, outrageous damage due to her passive, extremely big burst with headshot E headshot, stupidly hard to push against because of trap set up, stupidly hard to engage when shes at your turret, due to turret line and massive range.   I don&#039;t really have a problem with any other adc but caitlyn feels impossible to play against if the player is good, or if they have a team peeling.","replies":[]}
