Waiting doesn't seem to fix it right away so I have to exit the game and reconnect. I then get back into the game, play a little bit only to have my ping shoot up again to 500 (sometimes stuck at 700) and the only way to fix was exiting the game. It's way too frustrating and my teammates had been super hostile towards me after those games. \n\nIt doesn't deter me from the game, what my teammates say, however it breaks my heart when I can't even contribute and can't even play a game that I love using as means to pass the time and enjoy with my friends. If I can't even play by myself I'll only screw over my friends if I play with them. \n\nAdmittedly, my internet isn't the super best (get 70-120 as my best ping) BUT I can still play well and have little to no issues. If something does occur I can easily fix it, but this bug crash is ridiculous. The fact I can't wait out the disconnect like any normal disconnect is bad. If I've ever had a moment where it did this (and I have to exit the game and reconnect back in), it was cause the game waited too long for me to reconnect. This is like instant, not even resetting my router fixes it, only exiting the game.\n\nWhatever is causing this, please get it fixed.

Another thing they should do if they wish to reassure everyone is not give free IP points (they're useless to people who have all characters and runes they need), place a youtube video online or a webcast explaining and sharing with the community how much you actually value our input and devotion, and to acknowledge that you have heard our cries and are working diligently to fix them.......Not some stupid automatic machine created \"we really care about you\" message in the forums.
