I took a break from league for a few months and when I came back about a week ago (playing about a game or 2 a day since return) My game crashes while going into the game from champ select about every 2-3 games and forces me to fix my client after continuously not being able to reconnect. I was placed in low priority que then after three games my client crashed and made me fix installation again. In case my specs are needed I'll list them below\r\nmy specs are\r\ncpu: Intel core i5 4460\r\ngpu: gtx geforce 970 twin fozr\r\nhard drive: hitachi htc\r\nmobo: Asus Rock anniversary\r\npsu: corsair 600M \r\nram: 8gb","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-07-25T23:10:53.369+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're having to repair your client often as a result of crashes, it's likely that your installation is heavily corrupted. When crucial files are missing from the client, it's likely to cause not only poor performance in-game but also can crash your client at any point. I recommend grabbing our [Hextech Repair Tool](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/player-support/tools/Hextech%20Repair%20Tool.msi), checking the box for Reinstall along with the box for a Clean uninstall. Let this run for a while, then ensure League has the right [system permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions#wq3) to run. \n\nLet me know if these steps caused any change.","replies":[{"poster":"30for30","date":"2016-07-26T00:02:02.392+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Will try this tonight, thank you.","replies":[]}]}]}
