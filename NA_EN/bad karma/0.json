To be honest I haven't been looking here too often, and even more because I didn't know where I can see all the answers on my comments/threads! :s I am so sorry! About the topic: I haven't had any games with a Mundo in it since the time I talked to you, but a friend of mine had the same problem and somehow it went away after yesterday's patch! I will take a close look whenever I see a Mundo, and I will say you for sure if I have the same problem again!

While my death cleavers live to kill on, often my normal cleavers are invisible to the other team.\n\nThough I'm not sure that this bug didn't exist before the other cleaver fix, I had never gotten complaints from enemies about it.
