Time was long ago that his current passive was linked to his Q as a sort of parallel with {{champion:75}} who faces a similar yet less controversial issue IMHO. His current passive for anyone who may not know allows him to earn permanent AP upon HITTING A CHAMPION WITH ANY ABILITY OF HIS and even more when using an ability as the killing blow. Granted there are many champions with passives that scale throughout the course of the game such as the aforementioned{{champion:75}} and to a much lesser, and more widely excepted, extent {{champion:412}} . But I personally find an issue with champions that scale off of doing what everyone else already has to do of which there is a good number. Why is it that this champion is still allowed to build full defense and like a {{item:3070}}  and completely out damage others? Well if we go back to how he used to play his Q was the only factor in deciding how much extra AP he had. His cage I also feel needs to be changed as well. Its radius is slightly larger than {{champion:412}} Cage with a stun and a much lower cooldown. \r\n                His Ultimate was only based on his own/ the champions AP making him an Anti AP niche character I know, but it also helped to balance (lol) his ult to a slightly more manageable state, it being the only point and click ability in his kit. So unless you had/have really good {{item:3157}}  timing you weren't getting far. Now with it being scaled off of missing health and his AP which also scales from him killing things with his ult, which again is very easy it being a point and click, makes him able to literally snowball out of control on a consistent basis. Yeah I get it \"farming minions with his Q wasn't thematic to his villain persona\" or whatever but I highly doubt smashing minions in the middle of the desert is what {{champion:75}} does with his free time either so don't pull the lore excuse for it. If riot doesn't want to change the scaling it needs to at least be a skill shot. The Dark Matter ability he has would be a great substitute as opposed to the current one or literally any other skillshot. As a point and click however it shouldn't be that punishing to play against. Granted you can play champs like {{champion:157}}  and windwall it sure, but if you arent playing a gimmicky champion he can be a hassle to deal with. \r\n               I always prefer outplay ability to just trying to win in champ select. It promotes choice and variety in the game and there's always plenty of bans, especially nowadays where it gets harder and harder to find champions that aren't an absolute gimmick fest. Back to the point however no matter how much you shut him down in lane if he lands a few abilities in a teamfight or in trades then he immediately becomes viable again no matter how hard you try to keep him from doing so. Personally I would like a full rework but I know that wont happen for a long while. \r\n\r\nTL:DR {{champion:45}}  is a little to easy to snowball or comeback with because of how his passive and ult work. \r\nAny thoughts or suggestions on how some changes to make him funner to play against?","replies":[{"poster":"KlydeFrog","date":"2019-03-16T08:09:14.438+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"no just make his stun have a delay on hit","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-03-16T08:46:33.096+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=KlydeFrog,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=2zWo3T00,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2019-03-16T08:09:14.438+0000)\n>\n> no just make his stun have a delay on hit\n\nIt already does.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Iron Four Veigar","date":"2019-03-16T11:05:53.471+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I agree that Veigar needs changes, but it's more about nerfing his late game (removing the stupid W cdr buff) and buffing his early game. \n\nAnother option would be to give him more consistency but that would probably require him to be reworked again. Veigar as it is now is BAD, the only thing that he has going for him is the 2800 gold spike with GLP and then later on Rabadon to support his mid game by a large margin, but most of the time, games are decided before he even gets 4k gold. \n\nHe has no lane priority, does absolutely nothing till 6 and even then he isn't really a threat till lvl 11. IF Riot wants him to make him a late game champ, he needs some SERIOUS changes, without returning power to his cage or making his abilities more consistent, he'll never be that amazing in the late game as for example Kai'Sa or Viktor or anything like that. \n\nHe has always been a mid game champ ever since he was released only maybe being pretty good late game during the preseason 8 meta where everything slowed down and we had spellbook which helped him survive the laning phase.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Red Mage","date":"2019-03-16T08:57:11.306+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I would personally change Veigar's kit a little but with mostly the same concept.\n\nP - Take 20% of your current HP &amp; exchange it for 20% mana\nQ - Gain 1 stack per minion killed &amp; steal 1 AP from the enemy champion if you hit them, (can only be proc'd every 120 seconds.)\nW - Same\nE- Remove stun, anyone in the E gets their max HP reduced by 3,5,10,15,20% (lvl) anyone who leaves gets slowed by 20% (enemies inside of the E will have their damage increased by 10%)\nR - Keep R the same but instead of AP ratio &amp; execute at lower hp targets make it scale off of how many Q stacks you have increasing the ability to execute.\n\n\nHis current passive isn't really crazy so putting something like hp/mp swap would make it have more risk with more rewards\nHis Q pretty much would be the same but the ability to steal 1 AP from an enemy could grasp his him being more of a mid lane mage that wants to kill everyone.\nThe E has a lot of neat things but also at a price since lore states he has habit of helping people by accident debuffing the enemy and buffing them at the same time could be neat.\nR making it scale souly off of Q stacks means if they dont know how to farm it'll take them longer in the game to really shine leaving more counterplay for early game.","replies":[{"poster":"Iron Four Veigar","date":"2019-03-16T11:05:18.914+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"So....... make him absolutely useless?","replies":[]}]}]}
