(a mechanic that most players never took advantage of to start with).\r\n\r\nThe disadvantage is that minions are always pushing in all 3 lanes and even if you get the enemy team down or 3 out of 5 members you have no lane to get towers in. Despite attempts to properly set up a wave it still pushes back slowly. (a mechanic that a lot of players have expressed a dislike in).\r\n\r\nWhat if to counteract this, the minions got an attack speed and more importantly a movement speed buff based on how far ahead the enemy minions are and how many champions are down on the enemy team.\r\n\r\nThe buff would only kick in if at least 3 members on the winning team were dead AND there are more members dead for the winning team then the losing team because there is no reason to reward a team who is losing and losing fights. And it could be at full power when the winning team is full aced giving the losing teams minions a chance to sprint across the lanes and push for the win. Also, the buff would be lower the closer the game was at the time similar to how the pushing mechanic has less impact in a close game.\r\n\r\nThe only argument I can see against this is that it would be horrible to get aced in a mid-late game tower dive and lose most of your base despite the fact that you were winning for the entire game, but it is better than the alternative where you don&#039;t lose anything and just regroup for another push and just keep losing fights where the enemy team never gets anything back off of it until you win one fight and take the whole base because your team is in position to.\r\n\r\nThoughts?","replies":[]}
