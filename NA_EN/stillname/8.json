I know the purpose of these bombs is to shut off an choke point for the other team but 10 seconds is a very long time to do that. This is a game where morgana&#039;s binding feels like it lasts forever and this is an eternity by comparison.\n\nCompared directly to another long range mage with a similar kind of effect lux&#039;s e only lasts for 5 seconds.\n\nI don&#039;t think that Ziggs&#039; ability to take turrets needs to be hit directly Riot could indirectly nerf it by taking power away from the part of his kit that the person playing him won&#039;t miss as much. They could just lower the time or they could give it some scalling based on the number of points making it something like 6s/7s/8s/9s/10s.","replies":[{"poster":"dominusx","date":"2017-01-22T23:47:49.249+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i want him gone tbh. it's tiresome to deal with him outside lane phase. and his ult doing more dmg than smite makes it frustrating aswell.","replies":[]}]}
