Pretty sure the only reason they train in korea is because it allows the teams to play on a low-ping environment while also scrimming against non-regional teams. Higher competition though, that's highly suspect.","replies":[{"poster":"III BAKURYU III ","date":"2016-09-14T05:32:00.838+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What do you mean \"not necessarily high competition\" the LCK has literally owned League of Legends the players win every competition year in and year out.

I'd also like proof of the \"many NA/EU players getting stuck in diamond despite being challenger\", as not only is the latter part of that point entirely false (aside from bjerg/biofrost/doublelift/sneaky/jensen/impact/huhi/stixxay, much of NA challenger right now is filled with retired LCS players like QT or people who haven't really had a shot like arcsecond/goldenglue) but after listening to many former pros who did the korean bootcamp thing (IWdom/sneaky/aphromoo) the former also seems to be a pretty massive assumption based off of the notion that koreans are apparently \"gods of video games\". \n\nIn korea, the competition isn't exactly \"more fierce\" but instead \"more even\". Because everyone plays on 8 ping (again, this being one of the two big reasons why many of the professional teams send their players there and not due to skill), server lag get completely eliminated as an issue/excuse for people putting everyone on a more even playing field. If you miss a skillshot there, then 99.9% of the time it's solely your fault for that.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Wulf Helhammer","date":"2016-09-13T23:56:41.731+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"And the Europeans had the homefield advantage last year, and the Koreans the year before that.

The only reason the pros play solo-q is to make stream revenue. It does not affect their scrim, and professional gameplay whatsoever.
