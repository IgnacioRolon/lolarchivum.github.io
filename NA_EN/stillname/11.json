The buffs feel larger than the nerf of allowing champions to see him if they are directly on top of him. As a frequent Twitch player I feel like increasing the range he can be spotted at might be a valid option.\r\n\r\n* Courage of the Colossus Mastery - The shield might simply be to big or it might be alright and people are overhyping but I am starting to see a lot of players take this on champions that aren&#039;t actually tanks just because it is so good.\r\n\r\n* {{champion:107}}  and {{champion:121}} - Starting to see a lot of picks and bans gravitate to these two simply because they have access to upfront burst that a lot of the other assassins lost. Maybe they are just the only two survivors of the assassin changes but they do start killing everything if they get ahead.\r\n\r\n* {{item:3116}} - This item is being abused by a lot of ap champions and could maybe be looked at? An idea I had is to scale the slow based on how close the champion casting the spell is to the champion being hit. Less of a slow at longer distances.\r\n\r\nBuffs:\r\n\r\n* Most of the assassins ({{champion:84}} {{champion:7}}{{champion:91}}  just to name a few)  - They could be just very difficult to play and people are having a hard time adjusting so maybe it is best to wait another patch but to me most of the assassins feel like they have to have too much stuff go right that is beyond their control in order for them to use their burst.\r\n\r\nLet me know what your experiences have been so far I know that a lot of stuff could be buffed or nerfed but I tried to keep my list related specifically to what changed in the last patch. Rylais being the one exception.","replies":[]}
