Because that seems like an unfair advantage to the teams who have subs.\r\n\r\nYou have the potential to swap out a player who is playing bad, which already benefited Flash Wolves losing their first game to CLG and then going 4-1 with NL after their adc was a clear weakpoint in their first loss.\r\n\r\nSKT also has the factor that they can either play Faker (who already has a large champ pool) but they can put in Easyhoon which opens up for even more strategies.\r\n\r\nOn top of all of that if a team goes to 5 games with subs there is always the factor of a long series being mentally exhausting on the players... but not if you are subbing out.\r\n\r\nIt seems to like any team with substitutes has an unfair advantage in that lane in a game where small advantages are a big deal...","replies":[{"poster":"Draqone","date":"2015-10-12T01:21:46.515+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"All teams have 1 sub.\n\nAnd I think all they need is to announce to the officials they'll be making a swap after the previous game ends and that's it.","replies":[{"poster":"Stillname","date":"2015-10-12T01:28:27.429+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the info.. I still can't help but think something like this only exists because of the Faker/Easyhoon setup because most of the teams don't acutally have a sub they would be willing to use","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"RookCauldron","date":"2015-10-12T01:24:38.434+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's only one substitute per team.  So let's say that after Game 1 of AHQ vs SKT is over and coach Kkoma wants to put in Easyhoon. Kkoma can do that. BUT he cannot switch in Faker anymore. He would have to stick with Easyhoon for the rest of the series.","replies":[]}]}
