Most NA LCS teams have at least two non-region players. Any of those players who spend two seasons in the NA LCS no longer count as non-regional. So every two years you could potentially have twenty new players, or enough to field four LCS teams, become 'naturalized' NA players.\n\nNow, player changes happen too frequently in the LCS to make it probable that it will happen on that scale, but it would not be surprising if ~5 players get naturalized in this fashion every couple years. If they can use secondary squads to qualify for this time, then the growth could be much higher.\n\nThe reason this is even a concern is it allows a mechanism to defeat the out of region player limit's purpose in the first place: preserving regional identity for the fans. The moment there are no (or very few) NA players left on NA teams, then NA fans have lost any reason to cheer for their own region, and it will only promote bandwagoning to whichever team is 'best' at the moment, a phenomenon that is already quite present in the fan base.\n\nThe country where you have permanent legal residence status should determine your region as a player, with a few possible exceptions, such as Quas who was a NA LCS player before the South American league existed.","replies":[{"poster":"MegaManYYZ","date":"2015-11-26T16:24:43.536+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"hope you understand the average career span of esport players are pretty short, so 2 years is pretty long.\n\nand it isn't exponential growth at all, if anything it would be a steady linear growth of exports becoming local/regional.","replies":[{"poster":"Fflarn","date":"2015-11-30T03:46:16.750+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, I hope you understand that the first non-regional player in the NA LCS was Edward in the second half of season 3, at that time the only extra-regional player. from that point to season five there are more than 20 extra-regional players.
