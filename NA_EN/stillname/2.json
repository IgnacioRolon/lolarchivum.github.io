Several of his abilities are skillshots and his ultimate has plenty of counterplay on it. He also isn&#039;t a feast or famine champ like some of the other perma-nerfed champions.\r\n\r\nI don&#039;t think the game is in the same state it was when riot made the decision to nerf him out of it and I don&#039;t think that he needs to be reworked in order to be brought back into this game.\r\n\r\nIt&#039;s 2017 guys.

Meanwhile, Ezreal's Q has a 1.2 total AD scaling, lowers his cooldowns, and has higher range. \n\nThere's a reason urgot isn't that popular.","replies":[{"poster":"Big Lincoln","date":"2017-01-24T18:29:13.867+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"urgot Q can be made unavoidable","replies":[{"poster":"Pierce The Veal","date":"2017-01-25T17:07:49.069+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Big Lincoln,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=g7iEmphX,comment-id=000200010000,timestamp=2017-01-24T18:29:13.867+0000)\n>\n> urgot Q can be made unavoidable\n\nSure it can. But dealing 2/3rds the damage because you can occasionally make it lock on doesn't make him good. Not to mention ezreal's Q can proc on hits, like triforce. It's safe to say with that included ezreal's Q dps is over double that of Urgot's, all because Urgot can lock on to a target.","replies":[{"poster":"Big Lincoln","date":"2017-01-25T17:29:06.687+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"and because Urgot has a shield, % damage reduction towards himself, and damage reduction on his ult, not to mention he has armor shred and a permaslow while his shield is active \n\nurgot gets extremely tanky after he acquires a few items; there's no reason he should match Ezreal's DPS.","replies":[{"poster":"Pierce The Veal","date":"2017-01-26T19:47:59.678+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Big Lincoln,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=g7iEmphX,comment-id=00020001000000000000,timestamp=2017-01-25T17:29:06.687+0000)\n>\n> and because Urgot has a shield, % damage reduction towards himself, and damage reduction on his ult, not to mention he has armor shred and a permaslow while his shield is active \n> \n> urgot gets extremely tanky after he acquires a few items; there&#x27;s no reason he should match Ezreal&#x27;s DPS.\n\nA) he needs to build defensive items to get tanky\nB) he doesn't have a free flash\nC) damage reduction on his ult is countered by him literally putting himself in the enemy team as a ranged dps.\nD) he doesn't have free waveclear and execute from across the map.\n\nSinply put he's just worse in every way than ezreal.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2017-01-24T18:14:55.125+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=PPPPPPPPPPPP270,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=g7iEmphX,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2017-01-24T18:13:20.122+0000)\n>\n> Urgot&#x27;s design is very flawed to begin with.\n> He&#x27;s supposed to be an AD caster that does good DPS which sounds stupid when ADCs can do that with basic attacks from further range as well.\n> \n> They need to rethink Urgot&#x27;s kit.\n\nEzreal, Lucian, and Varus are prime examples of AD casters that actually work.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"tzvi","date":"2017-01-25T17:18:09.216+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"was playing him recently, and thought it would be a really good quality of life buff if his q refreshed mana on kill like annie's does","replies":[]},{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2017-01-24T18:13:09.455+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's been known for at least a week now that Urgot is confirmed as the next VGU.
