(Acutally just being aware that he can hunt you when you get low is enough.) It gets in the way of audio cues that actually matter and it isn&#039;t like Rengar ult where it only pops when you are being hunted.\r\n\r\nHis old one popped when he was nearby so it was helpful but this one just goes off whenever you are low and is very distracting.\r\n\r\nYou could even change it back to just a howl if you want. Just... not the whole audio clip from the preview video.","replies":[]}
