Some of us are vulgar (me), others know to to beat around the bushes with nice words. Core of our fears is the same. And believe it or not even the most trashy talk is still a good way of checking if players are in favour or against changes.\n\nSo far ALOT of players dislike it.\n\n> They showed you items they were thinking about putting onto the PBE for testing and instead of having a discussion on the items all anyone wants to do is shit on them and bitch about how weak they are going to make mages.\n\nYeah, we DID reacted too harsh, but for discussion both sides have to participate.\nAll we get is CertainlyT-level bullshit where they don't talk with us, but explain us over and over that those changes are set in stone and we can whine and cry with no changes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"NeoBrawler","date":"2016-04-08T00:39:52.213+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If everyone on the forms can instantly see that these items and changes will hurt the class that they were intended to help.
