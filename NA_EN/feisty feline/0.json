It ruins my gaming experience because continuously i have to wait a 20 minute penalty. Respectively I ask that can there be a different way to settle these types of situations and afk checks. For example, if there are repetitive reports on one summoner that keeps disconnecting then apply the punishment on that summoner, rather than a person that doesn't get reports on leaving a match because of bad internet. (And if you were wondering why don't i just get better internet, it's because my parents are cheap and won't spend their money on better internet)","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-02T04:00:04.654+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Feel free to repost this to the Miscellaneous Boards as a suggestion if you'd like. \n\nHowever, even if you don't have the quickest net in the neighborhood, you can still ensure your network settings are [compatible with League](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to ensure your configuration isn't the cause of your issues.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}
