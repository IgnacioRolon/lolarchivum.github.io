In reality, **Riot&#039;s primary goal is maximizing profit and the players&#039; experience is at best a secondary consideration.**\n\nBelow is a Google Trends chart showing LoL interest over time:\nhttp://i.imgur.com/clWuyaQ.jpg\nSource: https://www.google.ca/trends/explore#q=league%20of%20legends\n\nThe chart clearly shows that interest in League of Legends as a game has reached its top and is now on a down trend. If you&#039;re Riot, you can either let the down trend continue or try to change the dynamics of the situation.\n\nDynamic queue was implemented to stop, or at least slow down, the decline of interest in League of Legends.** It&#039;s an attempt to force users into having a personal connection with the game by making relationships a major part, if not the major part, of success in the game**. Riot does not want you to play solo because once you&#039;ve had your fill of the game, you have no reason to keep playing.\n\nJust like Facebook, Riot wants to profit from your relationships. They don&#039;t just want you to play a free game.\n\nHow Riot Benefits from Dynamic Queue:\n1. Players are less likely to quit if they have friends they&#039;ll leave behind.\n2. Friends are more likely to gift each other.\n3. Friends are more likely to buy skins and champions to impress each other.\n4. Friends are more likely to form real life groups that can serve as an introduction for new players.\n\nIn conclusion,** Riot is making a business decision and solo players are just collateral damage**. However, **Riot now realizes solo players are necessary for dynamic queue to function**  and so are attempting to keep solo players content enough to participate in the system without affecting their new social business model. Badges are a manifestation of this realization.","replies":[{"poster":"BeeCuz","date":"2016-06-22T20:55:13.632+0000","up_votes":83,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Enemy Feeder,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=1cQuwVZN,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-06-22T18:30:24.138+0000)\n>\n> It's an attempt to force users into having a personal connection with the game by making relationships a major part, if not the major part, of success in the game.\n\nWe cannot fault a business for wishing to prosper.\n\nBut we can point out that pre-made teams are not of universal appeal, and the imposition of such is synonimous with disenfranchising a part of the market.","replies":[{"poster":"Jeanne fan club","date":"2016-06-23T01:33:06.550+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":17,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"theArtifacts","date":"2016-06-23T02:51:42.253+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=9 Tailed Waifu,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=1cQuwVZN,comment-id=00030002,timestamp=2016-06-23T01:33:06.550+0000)\n>\n> Why would Riot do this to their game if all they want is money?

This Ranked Dichotomy has been apparent throughout league's history, with a more famous depiction being that of elo hell. Now if you know what elo hell is, a Player that is of moderately higher skill playing with players of lower skill but still losing due to the effects of matchmaking, you can begin to understand this issue. Dyna of course is helping, even with the boosting, By pushing more and more players into higher skill levels. Without a booster, players that were boosted too far are doomed to fall, but if they don't, Then they aren't compromising ranked, as that was the rank at which they would've stopped regardless.\n\nAnother issue that has been plaguing league before rampantly were auto lockers, or players that played one role every game regardless of the roles of their teammates. This of course has been solved mostly by the newer style of champion select, but dynamic has also had a large hand in dealing with the issue, of course by making sure one tricks can have their one trick.\n\nA third issue that having a queue of friends thoroughly helps is General ranked toxicity. A lot of people will tell you I'm wrong, But it is in fact those people that are wrong. They are like flat earthers, They ask for proof and as soon as you give them some they Decide it's false. The reason its less toxic is because toxicity is diffused through camaraderie, and though toxic games will be worse, as it will be more pungent, the frequency should be going down, especially after some time passes.\n\nThere is also the Issues of Supports. In the old days, support was just a Fuck you option most the time. More often than not supports were either players that did not understand the role, or players with a group, and even in the second case, it dictated that a support would need to exclusivly rank up with a friend. Not saying all cases mind you, Just most, at least In my experience. This over time would eventually lead to more and more issues, especially without any of the proper care the support role needed, and still needs. Specifically what this shortage means for a pure solo is that It would not function without a forced fill role, which in essence defeats the purpose of the new champion select entirely, or With Astronomical Wait timers, Such as Teambuilder.\n\nOf course there is also the business side, But I think that Overall Dyna is a good thing. There are still kinks that need to be worked out, But it's all good.\n\n\n\n\nAlso, Let's see if this piece of shit comment can hit -100. Come on you Dyna haters, I know you guys are allergic to facts and reasoning, Bring it On, I'll Take on the lot of you.","replies":[{"poster":"IMT Fish","date":"2016-06-23T03:08:36.141+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The premades solved the ranked toxicity because people don't want to flame at their friends/group for whatever reason. This did solve it but I think that was going in the wrong direction.

By teaching players that by yelling at one person you can get yelled at by several people, It will slowly but surely decrease toxicity induced from tilt.\nThe latter point will take a while to have its effects fully felt, But I've already noticed some changes, at least with my limited view of the situation.\n\nIt's not perfect, But with time and refinement, It could be great.","replies":[{"poster":"Solari Fortune","date":"2016-06-23T03:55:30.880+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=macromite,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=1cQuwVZN,comment-id=001000030000,timestamp=2016-06-23T03:37:31.922+0000)\n>\n> It&#x27;s not perfect, But with time and refinement, It could be great.\n\nThis is my main thing for Dynamic Queue atm, it may not be the perfect thing atm. but given time to fix up to help the solos more.

It doesnt. Its an excuse for people to cry why they have not reached higher levels. I started in bronze, ended in diamond last season. Instead of crying how unfair everything is in bronze, i improved myself, started to carry games, and win.\n\nAll it takes is skill and time, because statistically speaking everyone has an over 50% chance of winning. Skill and teamwork modifies the chance depending on their quality.\n\nBoosting is compromising ranked. If you have the skill, you will rise on your own, and if you have to get carried to your position, you frankly do not deserve it. This problem existed with soloq too. But it was severely limited. Currently, it is rampant,  you can even see people streaming their boosting adventures.\n\n2) Your second argument attributes the lack of autolockers or people with only 1 role to Dynamic. I agree dynamic helps with one of those, being with 1 roles. It doesnt help against autolockers however, since champ select was the only thing to impact it.\n\nHowever, i have a question. Should we even be helping One Trick Ponies in the first place? Even pro players play more than 1 champion at a very good level. Having a person play only 1 champion is bad, because he will ruin games with such things.\n\nEncouraging people to play different roles and champions is what should be done. You can have your main. But playing only 1 champion all your life? Unnaceptable. Such behavior should never be encouraged.\n\n3) Yes, frequency of toxicity will increase. HOWEVER. It will create even more problems.\n\nPremades usually are not going to point out each other misakes, since they are friends. As such, natural skill progression will be stifled, as the players will think they are doing good.\n\nPremades gang up on soloes when raging. Raging existed in soloq. But it was usually 14 person, 2 max. With dynamic you can have toxic 3-4 players which will make your game a living hell, since they have extreme power over the game, and can even ruin it for the solo just to spite him.\n\nFrankly, i will rather have individual frequent ragers that i can mute and who will have less impact on my game, rather than having 3-4 ragers who ruin my game whether or not i mute them. \n\n4) BULLSHIT. I am a support main, have been for a long time. and i call BULLSHIT. Most of the supports i have known were soloes, including me. They played the role because they liked it. And the new champ select made it especially easy for us.\n\nYes, there is a lack of supports. But you do not fix it by having teams or premades. Instead you fix the role to be more fun and rewarding to attract more players.\n\nSolo functioned and had plenty of supports beforehand. The wait times were not that high to warrant a new system.\n\n\nConclussion: I dont think dynamic q is a good thing, especially since it ruin ranked integrity. You make your arguments on false premises. Moreover, most of the things you mentioned, could be fixed BETTER with other systems than dynamic. And would operate when having soloq. \n\nThe whole concept of dynamicq is corrupted and bad at its core for a competative environment.\n\nP.S. We Dynamicq \"Haters\" have shitloads of arguments that are extremelly valid. WE HAD THEM FOR FCKING 6 MONTHS BEFORE DYNAMIC EVEN CAME OUT! Yet all of the time we were ignored and noone gave a shit. People are tired of pointing the same points out 10000000 times, that is why they simply dont bother anymore.","replies":[{"poster":"macromite","date":"2016-06-23T13:19:54.631+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"1) elo hell is a thing that does exist. IT always had and frankly it probably always will. I described it well, if you still don't understand it and choose to say I'm wrong for using the common nomenclature, then I hate to say that the point you have made is not a valid one.\n\n2) When I say one tricks, I was more in reference to people that play one role. and queueing with friends is the only things that helps that. should we be helping them? yes. is it better for others? yes. and does it encourage other roles? as the only way to easily take a certain role is by playing with friends, I would say yes yet again, as doing that may make them see other roles in a new light. This argument of your's is solved in its entirety, just because you don't like the outcome doesn't mean that it isn't the best possible outcome.\n\n3) Decrease* you said increase. trust me, premades are pointing each others mistakes out. you just can't tell, and it isn't taking chat space. it's never a one way street. it looks like ganging up, but more than likely it's a free for all, the guys that are blaming the random are the guys that are blaming everyone. cept in certain circumstances, such as the solo being a jungler or support, but to those roles having four people yelling at you is nothing new, and isn't something solo would solve. infact solo would likely make it worse.\n\n4) I can call bullshit on you as well. I have known about 40-50 different supports throughout me playing league, and all of them either shifted out of the role or refuse to play it without a group because they were not willing to trust random adc's.\n\nFun is Arbitrary, nothing is inherently more fun. and notably, in league, support is a role that will never attract people. this is partially due to damage balance and income, partially due to item requirements and slot ineffectiveness, and Partially due to the general response towards supports. Most randoms Treat supports like shit through to gold. most people pick their mains bronze to silver, and supports are one of the hardest characters to carry games with.\n\n\nConclusion, Three of your arguments are bullshit, one of them is arguable, but you don't give a shit about anything i'm typing here. You've already gone full flat earther.\n\nAlso, just want to point out, I was anti dyna at the start as well, until I realized that dyna was actually a very good system that went into a place to fit a problem seamlessly. all of the anti dyna arguments are poorly thought out, and demand that you forget what pre dyna was to work.","replies":[{"poster":"Dextix LT","date":"2016-06-23T14:35:50.407+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"1) I know what you meant, and i answered to it. No matter how unlucky, you might be, it is highly statisticaly improbable that you will be kept down below your skill level. The concept of Elo Hell has been debunked 100000 times, and is being debunked to this day by Elo Boosters and smurfs. You will get to where you belong. YOur rank is not exact, but it is at least closely enough measured.\n\nYou are also ignoring the other edge of the sword, when people with no skill are being boosted to ranks they do not belong in.\n\nExperiencing \"Elo Hell\" is very improbable. Ruining ranked integrity is not worth it.\n\n2) No it does not encourage other roles. Why would you need or want to play another role if you can get yours all the time because you are premade? You have no need or want to do that. Watching your friends play a role, is able to make you like it, but again, that could have happened without friends either.\n\nWe should encourage players to play different roles and champions. Being in a premade does not ddo that since you are able to consistently get the role you want, thus leading to no need for other roles.\n\n3) Yea decrease. And no, premades are LESS LIKELY, to point each others mistakes. Its basic psychology. They are in your group, you know them, and you dont want to offend or hurt them, thus you are less critical of them. There is a reason why for example courts or police do not allow certain people to take certain cases, because their judgement may be compromised. This however doesnt apply with randoms. The same with raging, i have seen far too many groups that actually gang up on people. Having soloes raging is different than premades. Because with soloes its almost always a solo rager, which can be muted and has not that much impact over the game, when compared to a group of people, who can ruin your experience and rage you at the same time as a group.\n\n4) If that were the case, que times would be very long. And they are not. At least, they were not, until Dynamic. There have been many solo supports, without them the games would not operate, its simple as that.\n\nAnd supports need help to be more impactfull. SO more people would want to play that role and feel like they have impact. Its the role and playstyle of the supports that is causing people not to play them, not the reception or treatment by other people, since otheriwse junglers would be extinct by now, since they receive even more rage than supports do.\n\n\n\nI am a flat earther how? What FACTS am i not believing? To be a flat earther i should use faith and ignore facts. But you present only arguments that i refute, then you refute mine. Its a discussion. And i read your arguments, i wouldnt be able to argue against them otherwise, i just disagree with the premises.\n\nAnd no, dynamic is not a good system. It ruins ranked integrity. Doesnt give a level playing field, and makes solo contribution and experience worse.","replies":[{"poster":"macromite","date":"2016-06-23T15:20:04.955+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"Yep, Full flat earther.
