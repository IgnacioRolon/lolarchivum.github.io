Kayle wouldn't be a Shuriman Ascended, her Ascension would come the same way Kayn's does, by mastering a weapon with an Ascended sealed within it. And Morgana wouldn't be a Darkin, as she isn't a corrupted Ascended, and she wouldn't be wielding a Darkin, because she doesn't have a weapon, but that doesn't mean the corruption from a Darkin isn't bound to her directly.\n\nIt lines up with what Aatrox says about them.

Petricite! An anti-magic material harvested from petrified trees. Maybe the battle that lead Naganeka and Valeeva to fight in what would be Demacia, Naganeka unleashed a scream turning an entire forest into petricite, sacrificing herself to try and save Valeeva. Then Valeeva, fueled with revenge, fought with her winged sword and Naganeka's chain until she was finally sealed away beneath the petrified forest. Then however many years later when Poppy seemingly vanished with Orlon's hammer, the new symbol of Demacia was the winged sword found beneath the city.\n\nSorry, I was struck with inspiration there for a sec... \n\n> You can&#x27;t just say Valeeva is tied to Demacia without knowing.\n>\n> This is the kind of misinformation spreading I&#x27;m talking about.\n\nSo what, they would make the Darkin Varus is searching for, who he couldn't find in Shurima, be a zombified Darkin from the Shadow Isles?\n\nThere aren't many placed Valeeva could be tied to. She is either connected to Demacia, or the Blessed Isles.\n \n> Only Morgana&#x27;s and Valeeva&#x27;s color schemes correlate.\n\nNeed I remind you she was once an Ascended. Her colors could have changed with her corruption.\n\n> Vastaya can have wings too.\n\nThe likelihood of Kayle and Morgana being Vastyan Aspects in Demacia seems... farfetched.\n \n> Mostly lions though, right?\n\n...Yes, house lions were commonplace in Egypt...

And from what we know about the places the weapons were sealed, they became hubs of human activity.\n\n> It does not make sense that Darkin weapons can just be combined all of a sudden.\n> \n> What reason could she possibly have for making a scale anyway? How is a scale a more effective weapon than the sword she was already wielding, if Valeeva&#x27;s weapon being a sword is to be believed?\n\nIt would most likely amplify both weapon's abilities. Like if Diana got her hands on Leona's sword, she would be significantly more powerful.\n\nMy guess as to how a scale would be strong than a sword is the scale can shoot things... most likely fire. \n\n> What?\n> \n> Why would they be fighting and then suddenly one of them would sacrifice themself to save the other?\n\nOh no, I mean fighting the warrior queens who were hunting them down with their armies. Valeeva and Naganeka fighting the warrior queen's army.\n\nIn fighting the warrior queen Naganeka sacrificed herself, turning herself, the queen's army, and the giant forest into nothing but petricite. Then Valeeva eventually fell to the warrior queen and was sealed on the spot.\n\n> Poppy didn&#x27;t disappear?\n\nWell she left with the hammer.\n\n> There&#x27;s no &quot;winged sword&quot; underneath Demacia.\n\nSince the founding of Demacia, their strongest weapon has been their symbol, it was once the hammer, that left with Poppy, now is it a winged sword... Kayle's sword. \n\nThere are two ways this happened. The sword was already where they were building Demacia, or the sword was brought to Demacia by an Aspect Vastyan... A race Demacia is strongly against. A race that regularly hates humans. \n\n> Varus isn&#x27;t done searching through all of Shurima.\n> \n> He literally only searched one tomb. That&#x27;s it.\n> \n> He&#x27;s still got an entire continent left.\n> \n> Besides, Demacia and the Shadow Isles are not the only places left in the world.\n\nWell, he sure as hell won't be searching Targon, or the Shadow Isles, he won't be searching Bilgewater because there is no burying anything in Bilgewater, and Zaun is a techno bridge spanning a deep river, that would be a weird place to bury anything, that just leaves Demacia.\n\n> Just like Kayle and Morgana somehow splitting a Darkin is.\n\nAgree to disagree\n\n> Could you fit another ellipsis in there?\n\nYes. Also there are no Lions in Egypt.\n\n> All of the gods weren&#x27;t falcons?\n\nThe bird gods were mostly falcons, an eagle, and a crane.\n\nBesides the crane, not of lot of visual differences between the bird gods.\n \n> I don&#x27;t think Riot would just &quot;steal&quot; the Sphinx like that.\n\nWhy not?

The problem with that is, clearly not all Targonians worship the sun or moon, and Targon is the only thing left in their culture to worship.\n\nWhat do you mean by \"clearly\"?\n\n> \n> Well, it&#x27;s not insanity, Renekton being a pure Ascended disproves that. \n\nRenekton might get retconned into being a Darkin for all we know.\n\nHis lore was before the relaunch, was it not?\n\nThen it's basically non-canon, right?\n\n> \n> It&#x27;s not being a tyrant, Xarath is still considered an Ascended.\n\nXerath wasn't a tyrant during The Great Darkin War.\n\n> \n> That leaves other worldly blood magic, which could still have it&#x27;s origins in the Void, and direct confrontation with the Void.\n\nI do not think Blood Magic can be considered Void Magic.\n\n> \n> There is Targon and Shurima, yes, but Targon seems like the one place a Darkin fleeing the gods wouldn&#x27;t go,\n\nNone of The Darkin ever fled anywhere, they were imprisoned.\n\n> and Varus already searched Shurima.\n\nVarus hasn't searched *all* of Shurima yet.\n\nYou make it seem like he can travel the entirety of a continent and search every single tomb there in less than a day.\n\nI don't think even a Darkin could accomplish that.\n\n> \n> Places like Zaun and Bilgewater are out, because Zaun was built on a bridge, and nothing is buried in Bilgewater. And from what we know about the places the weapons were sealed, they became hubs of human activity.\n\nThe Serpent Isles near Bilgewater also exist.\n\n> \n> It would most likely amplify both weapon&#x27;s abilities.

Valeeva and Naganeka fighting the warrior queen&#x27;s army.\n> \n> In fighting the warrior queen Naganeka sacrificed herself, turning herself, the queen&#x27;s army, and the giant forest into nothing but petricite. Then Valeeva eventually fell to the warrior queen and was sealed on the spot.\n\nWhy would they ally, much less actually give their lives for the other? The Darkin hated each other just as much as they hated anyone else.\n\nIf anything, Naganeka would probably sooner sacrifice Valeeva to save her own hide.\n\nAnd the queen's army can't be turned into petricite. She needs them later on to seal herself beneath Pallas, and I think it would be written somewhere in Demacia's history that there's an area full of statues.\n\n> \n> Well she left with the hammer.\n\nShe didn't \"leave\", she's still within the borders of Demacia.\n\n> \n> Since the founding of Demacia, their strongest weapon has been their symbol, it was once the hammer, that left with Poppy, now is it a winged sword... Kayle&#x27;s sword. \n> \n> There are two ways this happened. The sword was already where they were building Demacia, or the sword was brought to Demacia by an Aspect Vastyan... A race Demacia is strongly against. A race that regularly hates humans. \n\nIf the sword was already there when they were building Demacia, it would've been the symbol from the beginning, not the hammer.\n\nAnd nobody said anything about \"Aspect Vastaya\" here.\n\nBut yes, I do find it more plausible that the sword, if it even exists, was brought there rather than it being something that was found.\n\n> \n> Well, he sure as hell won&#x27;t be searching Targon, or the Shadow Isles, he won&#x27;t be searching Bilgewater because there is no burying anything in Bilgewater, and Zaun is a techno bridge spanning a deep river, that would be a weird place to bury anything, that just leaves Demacia.\n\nBilgewater and Zaun makes sense, but I do not see why he wouldn't be searching in Targon or the Shadow Isles.\n\nHis love for his sister should outclass any potential fear he has of Targon, and same thing with the undead. I do not even know why he'd be scared of the undead to begin with.\n\nAlso, he isn't done searching Shurima.\n \n> Agree to disagree\n\nWhatever you say.\n\n> \n> Yes.

It even said his kind, yordles, once lived openly with humans and the wise yeti of the Freljords.
