That's a big part of where the 'context doesn't matter' come from.

Even back during the Tribunal days when both ally and enemy chat was shown the vast majority of the time it didn't change the outcome of the case at all whatsoever, and in some cases even served to work against the player in question. The IFS (which was built in part with data gathered from the Tribunal) only shows the defendants logs because only their behavior is being judged in their case and no one elses, hence why context doesn't matter here. It's supposed to encourage people to look at their own behavior and where they might have gone wrong at rather than look for someone else to blame for their mistakes.","replies":[{"poster":"SUCC Ghast","date":"2018-06-21T05:25:06.491+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"idk who downvoted you, so I gave you an upvote.
