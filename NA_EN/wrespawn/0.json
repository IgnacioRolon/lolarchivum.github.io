I've gone so far as reformatting my computer to have a fresh install. Why does this game not support dual monitors or alt tabbing? On character selection I alt tab my second screen to see what good counters are for what the enemy team pick but I find that a lot of the time the game just disconnects and I have to quit in order to get back in. This causes me to get temp banned because I left match making. What's even worse is when I have to play a lane I'm not use to. I play support. that's all I play, i can play ADC but I'm a much better support. So if I get ADC I need to be able to alt tab so I can pick decent runes. You guys completely revamped runes and then make it impossible to alt tab to see what decent runes you can pick. What a joke. Stabilize your client for the love of god.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-26T21:56:55.718+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, it sounds like you might be alt+tabbing on the loading screen, which runs a pretty high risk of causing a hiccup in your connection which can boot you from the game. It's generally best to get stuff like rune pages setup before the match, and focus on the game once it gets going. Other than that, I'd probably try and ethernet connection get a more stable link if you find you have to keep alt+tabbing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"wrespawn","date":"2017-11-26T21:00:51.787+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thanks for giving me a leaverbuster warning CUZ UR CLIENT SUCKS.
