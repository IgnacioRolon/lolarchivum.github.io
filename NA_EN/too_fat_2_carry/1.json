Want proof? Look at the last champions released. One more broken than the next. Senna the ADC support, Aphilios who basically 1 shot 2 people all game bottom lane until they \"fixed\" him. And my personal favorite Sett, who's entire kit is basically designed to 1v3.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porked Ya Nan","date":"2020-02-11T01:18:41.950+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Olaf is beatable, I play him with 6 berserker and hardly every come first.
