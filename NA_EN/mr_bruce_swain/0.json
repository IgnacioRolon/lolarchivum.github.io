Phones sometimes get bundled with slightly different browsers that handle webpages differently. Google has been trying to standardize these versions a bit by adding an upgradeable app to the play store: [Android System Webview](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.webview&hl=en). \n\nInstalling/updating this package and rebooting your device might help solve this issue. If you are still seeing the same thing afterwards, please let us know. We're also going to do some digging on our end to see what might be causing this to begin with.","replies":[{"poster":"Mr Bruce Swain","date":"2016-06-08T14:00:14.400+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had it up to date all along, tried reinstalling it but to no effect.\nIntrestingly enough ive got two system apps called android system webview\nhttp://oi66.tinypic.com/be6kp4.jpg\nBut both are updated and also tried to turn each of them off to see if they dont conflict with each other but nope still the same.\n","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Messx3","date":"2016-06-06T12:54:48.519+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi,\nSame issue here.
