My mouse sensitivity is about where I like it.  It works fine on the desktop and when I loaded up the League client and through the queue and champ select.  Once the game actually started though, it cranked way down for some reason.  I tabbed out and it was just fine on the desktop.  I checked Control Panel, no settings had changed.  My mouse sensitivity in the game was just terribly low.  I cranked the setting all the way up in Control Panel and that barely helped.  Has anyone had a similar problem and know of a fix?  It was really annoying.","replies":[{"poster":"RottedApples","date":"2016-05-25T01:49:18.159+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i usually have to adjust sensitivity in games whenever i get a new mouse for some reason (like the previous one broked)\n\nif you are dealing with new hardware (you say you have a new laptop? did you buy a mouse for it or are you using the trackpad?) then you might need to check the sensitivity in games. Not just league either but other games. Even though you can change sensitivity on your computer itself sometimes games will have separate sensitivity bars so it might be worthwhile to also take a look in game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RiotBok","date":"2016-05-25T01:06:03.405+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you adjusted your mouse speed/sensitivity options in game at all?  You said it was low, but I'm not sure if that means your settings were changed low or if your mouse was just acting slowly.  In-game, it will primarily be affected by your in-game settings, where the client, champ select, etc. will use your default windows settings.\n\nLet me know!","replies":[{"poster":"bigben2572","date":"2016-05-25T01:09:48.833+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hey can u please alert riot about the gameplay tab bug, i really wanna buy runes. ty.","replies":[]}]}]}
