Abilities interrupting themselves","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Abilities interrupting themselves\" isn't the best description but it's the only thing I can say for sure that can be understood without visual aids. Attacks like Sions Q always interrupt themselves, and his E fires off the second I hit the button, I don't get the ability to aim it first.\r\nThis isn't the first time this has happened to me, last time I tried everything, got a new expensive keyboard, ran the hextech repair tool, got every LoL friends opinion, no luck. So I just quit the game for about 6 months and it appeared to fix itself, for about a year, but now it's back\r\nSomeone please help, I just got a bunch of new skins and would hate to just walk away again.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-09T02:18:30.506+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you *may* have *Quickcast* enabled This would make the spells instantly fire off as you press the buttons, rather than giving you time to aim them or click on someone. Below are screenshots of what I'm talking about\n\n(Click to enlarge)\nhttp://imgur.com/a/fWYOZ\n\nI'd recommend switching to **Normal Cast** to see if it resolves what you're experiencing. Let me know if this helped!","replies":[{"poster":"SirDrMrFibblesJr","date":"2016-11-10T00:58:43.075+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That was it.
