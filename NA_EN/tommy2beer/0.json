I recalled another program I use (for Online Poker) requiring the same pre-requisite software so I opened that program (Hold'em Manager 2) and updated and closed it.  I had previously manually deleted the C++ 2005 from my computer, thinking it would fix the error with the LoL installer. \nI guess something collided with the two programs.\n\nAnyway, everything is working, league is updating now.  See you guys on the Rift.

You can also download the windows product manually here:  [Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Redistributable Package](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=3387).
