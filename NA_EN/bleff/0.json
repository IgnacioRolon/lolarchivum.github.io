We have a large website and teamspeak, and we try to host daily events for you to be able to play with people such as aram inhouses, hide and seek, defend soraka bot etc. We've also got tournaments with giveaways as well as organized ranked teams. If you ever get bored of league you could just jump down to one of our different sections for games such as counter strike, heroes of the storm, warframe and smite. Competitive teams also get their own channels on our teamspeak.\n\nRemember that you have to be 16+ to join and have working microphone, communication wins games :)\n\nWhy play alone if you can get to know bunch of friendly people?\n\nFeel free to take a look:\n\nWebsite: http://thechaosvanguard.co.uk/ \nTeamSpeak: ts3.thechaosvanguard.co.uk","replies":[]},{"poster":"YoshixZeFabulous","date":"2015-07-24T06:52:12.736+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IGN: YoshixZeFabulous\nRank: Plat 4\nRole: top (tank)\nBest Champs: Cho'Gath, Nocturne, Shen, Olaf, Gnar","replies":[]},{"poster":"AcE MaiNo","date":"2015-07-24T04:21:03.893+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IGN: ace maino\nRank: gold iv\nRole: top\nBest Champs: gnar, maoki, rumble, irelia","replies":[]},{"poster":"aCuddlyUSERNAME","date":"2015-07-24T04:04:57.236+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IGN: HahaWhoops\nRank: Gold 1\nRole: Uh you want top right? xD\nBest Champs: J4, Rive, Rumble, Shen, Gnar, Hec, Irelia, and whoever else you want xD","replies":[]},{"poster":"MadDogDobberman","date":"2015-07-24T04:02:38.644+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ign:maddogdobberman\nrank:S3\nrole:top\nbest champs: sion,fizz,hecarim,maokai gnar trundle jax","replies":[]}]}
