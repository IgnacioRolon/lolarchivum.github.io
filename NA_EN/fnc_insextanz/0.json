You've run some pretty solid steps so far, targeting your network.

It will have some extra options like auto-configuring your firewall settings just in case.\n\nLet me know if that helps, otherwise we'll go from there!","replies":[{"poster":"Alive","date":"2017-04-06T04:37:30.935+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"still have this problem and posted about this earlier, maybe i think you can try locating the problem on your end seems like a europe related problem","replies":[]}]}]}
