People here aren't being riot fans. They are thinking like a business.  Their main source of revenue comes from selling skins.  As a business they are already giving us quite a lot of free stuff through the hextech chests which costs them money and lowers their overall revenue.\n\nIf you bought champions with rp then that was your decision.  The deal was one champion for x amount of rp.  There was nothing hinted at later, nothing was promised and you don't deserve shit for buying a champion with rp instead of ip.  \n\nOn the topic of daily login.  They have the first win of the day bonus.  That is the daily login reward.  Its actually 22 hours  not a full day but that doesn't matter.  What else do you want them to give you as a daily login gift?  Free ip? Thats the same reward without working for it.  Free rp?  Fuck no, again see above, they are a business.  \n\nRiot may eventually give people icons based on how much you have paid, but I doubt it.  I think it was actually done one year during the harrowing where If you bought a certain amount of rp during it you got the higher tiered icons.but I can't remember which year.  \n\nOverwatch and For Honor are both paid games.  To reiterate from above, You spent $400 willingly and got exactly what you paid for.  You are not entitled to anything just because you spent more money on the game than some other players.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DJ Lucio","date":"2017-04-18T14:49:52.117+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You deserve more for paying RP for things?\n\nYou daily is the IP bonus and you have weekly chests+monthly key frags\n\nYou don't play the game for compensation, you play it cause you like it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Incognonymous","date":"2017-04-18T16:36:00.218+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=DJ Lucio,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=y4JvAjnU,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-04-18T11:42:49.565+0000)\n>\n> Skins would be too common as many people would just spam buy them with IP.\n\nYou can't \"spam\" buy them with IP if they're like 50,000 IP each.\n\nThere's literally no good reason to have an in game in currency that can barely buy anything.

What is a good way for players to spend excess IP points without creating more bots? Yes, we have new champs, chromas, runes, and etc.  However, there is always a stopping point for the player when purchasing those listed items (mostly gameplay). Especially when they have 100k IP..... Buying a few champs using that amount of IP will hardly put a dent in it.","replies":[]}]}]}
