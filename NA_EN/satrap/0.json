At the same time, my brother is playing another league match (using the same internet connection) and he has normal ping. As soon as I finish that match and go for a new match, everything is good. When lagging, I use command prompt to check my ping and it shows good results.\r\n\r\nSincerely","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-13T00:13:06.145+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmm, which IP were you testing to when you checked your latency (ping)? If it wasn't 31.186.224.42 and ran for more than 4 packets, it may not have provided you an accurate estimate. Since your brother isn't experiencing issues with his latency, this is most likely caused by network settings unique to your PC or an issue with your networking adapter. I'd recommend going through our [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to ensure all your local network settings are fine before we investigate further from there.\n\nLet me know if this helped your latency!","replies":[]}]}
