If you are being told that your behavior isn't acceptable for a certain venue, the solution isn't to complain about the standards of the venue, it's to adjust your own behavior. Because that's how personal responsibility works. You don't get to control everyone else; you control yourself. It is not the responsibility of everyone else to cope with your problems.

People talking loudly in a crowded theater isn't hurting anyone; it's still not acceptable, and it can totally get you removed. Being a loud, obnoxious drunk at a bar isn't causing physical harm to anyone, but it will still get you kicked out if you're bothering all the other patrons. The drug addict passed out in the library isn't hurting anyone. He's going to be asked to leave. Ever try to go to a nice restaurant without a shirt? Is getting hurt by your lack of upper body apparel? No, but, you aren't going to be allowed to dine there. There are plenty of things that aren't hurting anyone that still aren't okay.

To be fair, I'm pretty sure you're referring to the exceptionally rare extreme cases (I'd also wager you didn't know Tourette's is spectrum disorder and those cases are as extreme as they get, but that's really neither here nor there) But you know what happens when you have Tourette's and keep saying \"bomb\" on an airplane? They kick you off. If you're at a theater and you're being disruptive they can remove you, or have you watch from the sound booth where no one else can hear you. I promise you, even people with Tourette Syndrome don't get a free pass.\n\n>They get special medical treatment.\n\nNot a rule.\n\n>They get special government treatment.\n\nWhat special treatment exactly is that? Unless the special treatment is that they are allowed to break established laws, it doesn't count.\n\n>I bet you they even get special treatment from random people.\n\nIf by special treatment you mean \"made fun of a lot\", I guess you're right.

It's a personal choice.\n\n> Doesn't have to be Tourettes. There are more examples. \n\nThen perhaps you should give some examples. And I don't mean people getting help for their disabilities. I mean people with disabilities being allowed to break laws or rules because of their disability. \n\n>I get it, you don't want to be mean to \"disabled\" people. Good for you.

Lets say you are a teacher and I am a student that keeps throwing things across the classroom. What are you going to do about it? You're just going to keep letting me disrupt class and interrupt the learning process for all your other students? Let's say I'm an employee who keeps stealing tools and materials from your company. What do you do?\n\n>Depending on who you talk to, it is a law of nature.\n\nDepending on who you talk to, the world is flat.\n\n> Love is scientifically and religiously backed.\n\nIn what sense is it backed? That it's a good thing? Sure. I don't think anyone is going to argue that it's not. That loving everyone is a good thing? Again, sure. That it fixes all problems or is a replacement for rules and punishment? That I'm going to have to see some sources on. \n\nAlso, I'd point out religion is pretty big on punishment and consequences for one's actions. Ever heard of Hell? Yeah, and you thought not being allowed to play a video game was harsh.\n\nAnd why don't you love me? I assume you don't because you've repeatedly made personal attacks against me: calling me overly sensitive, implying that I don't love people, that I'm disrespectful and don't care about anyone other than myself. I thought we were supposed to love everyone? Why is it okay for you to be disrespectful towards me?

Players who behave properly and in a mature and respectful manner get rewarded with mystery skins/summoner icons, ranked rewards (for those who play ranked), access to Hextech Crafting and get to keep their honor points and badges among other rewards/privileges.

He's basically saying to the OP \"Look, we both know that you've been punished multiple times for reasons that were not cursing at a toxic person. Lying isn't gonna get you anywhere here\". Tantram usually only calls out players who know that they have a fairly lengthy punishment history and yet still make claims like that. To me that's not so much witch-hunting as it is just calling those players out on their behavior whenever they try to lie to gain sympathy from other like-minded players.","replies":[{"poster":"TimoDerBeste","date":"2017-03-04T01:54:36.452+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If someone call me stupid I cannot wish he got run over by a truck? \"You are stupid\" is more affirmative than \"I wish you ...\" right?
