(edit) forgot to talk about the game we ended up loseing they just killed our base, but it was unfair because we all connected back into the game when our baron timer was 1/3rd out, its dumb to count this as a loss.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-08-01T18:03:41.094+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's a weird situation, I haven't seen any reports of games crashing like this.  Were you a full team possibly on the same network?  Your local network or ISP could have had a hiccup in that case.
