Do you have a link handy for that announcement?  I'd say try hiting up their [support site](http://openbucks.com/contact.html), they may be able to find some additional options to get this fixed up.  Let me know if that works out!","replies":[{"poster":"Thug Senpai","date":"2017-04-03T02:47:08.441+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So I got an email. They said they made the announcement February that they would stop accepting burger king gift cards by March 31. They didn't send me a link yet so I'm waiting for that. They were going to try to convert the burger king gift card into a different gift card that I could use for riot points. Unfortunately my friend already spent the gift card at burger kings so that's that. However I'm going to do my best to get you that link so you can help spread that info as best as you can.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-04T15:47:45.038+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the update on this!  I'm glad to hear they were able to work something out, though it's a bummer it was already used.  :/  Hopefully he got some good nuggets out of them.  Or cheeto's mac.  Hopefully he atleast shared.  >.>","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Thug Senpai","date":"2017-04-02T14:58:51.620+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm sorry my first comment was misleading. I assumed you guys had an announcement that I somehow missed. I sent a message to openbucks asking for a link to any announcements they may have made to dropping burger king from the list. But I will say that it's only been my friend who've previously used burger king gift cards. He said he used a burger king card last week for riot points, but there could be remembering wrong so I'll let you know when I get a response from Openbucks. But if they DID drop burger king from their list of gift cards they accept I was hoping you guys could make an announcement so that a lot of other people don't accidentally waste money on.","replies":[]}]}]}
