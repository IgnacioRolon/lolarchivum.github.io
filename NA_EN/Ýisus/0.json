But with the overclocking done up to 4.8ghz - it competes with the mass majority of intel chips.  I am sure we will both agree that the fx8350 @ 4.8ghz is an overkill for any gaming application ( maybe not rendering applications ) but for raw gaming it is a well above any game on the market currently.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-05-07T19:00:08.459+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is not, actually. Barely sufficient for a lot of modern games at 60Hz and cripplingly bad if trying to target 120/144Hz.\n\n\nThe IPC difference between Piledriver and Ryzen is over 40%, and there is another 5% (roughly) between that and Skylake / Intel 14NM IPC, clock speed is only a useful metric when comparing chips in the same architecture, but clockspeed * IPC gives a rough idea of how fast they actually are, before worrying about latency and other oddities.\n\nTL;DR a 4.8Ghz Piledriver CPU is about as fast as a 3.2Ghz Skylake or Ryzen.\n\nAs a comparison, a lot of newer games require a 4.8-5.2Ghz Kaby/Coffee Lake (Skylake with minor tweaks) to reach 120 fps with _any_ GPU. Some games simply cant due to being too limited by single-core speed.\n\nDefinitely better for rendering than gaming - in fact that is the only reason anyone well-informed in hardware ever bought one, in an age where other 8-core simply did not exist remotely close to the same price.\n\nTotally fine for LoL and other e-sports at 60Hz, which is the vast majority of gaming, though.\n\nCurrent games are rapidly shifting towards 6 threads (or even 8/12/16 for a few), due to how popular the R5 1600 was last year and the release of Coffee Lake. And as CPU speeds have not increased meaningfully for over 5 years, while games continue to get more complex and use higher polycounts (animation/physics load), CPU and RAM threads/speed are becoming more and more important; \"only GPU matters for games\" was true 10 years ago (and for 10 year old games), but not anymore.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"need a namexD","date":"2018-05-07T03:39:32.740+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i close explorer just to make league playable\n{{sticker:zombie-nunu-bummed}}","replies":[]}]}
