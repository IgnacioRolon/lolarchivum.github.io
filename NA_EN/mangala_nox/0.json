Run through the permissions guide to restore access, than grab the hextech repair tool to perform a force repatch to fix any bad files. Let me know if you have any questions!\n\n\n\nWhen the new patch came out 7.16 it keeps telling me\n\n\"We have restored this installation to an older version of league of legends. Now we'll try to patch up to the latest version.\"\n\nThen when I click okey I does nothing idk but when I log in too the home screen it keeps loading and loading so I can see what's new or what's on free row.\n\nThen few min later I does the same thing but it keeps spamming it over and over and won't stop I can't enjoy this game without haveing this problem plz help when can\n\n I copy and paste it so I won't take long to type it all out I did everything he told me I came to pc to enjoy lol and I can't","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2017-08-25T02:25:29.927+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think Porocles was on the right track.  If there is consistently a mismatch with patch versions, something is weird.  Its like the patcher is updating itself, and thinks its updated properly, but then when the client double-checks it, it finds out it actually wasn't.  \n\nGiven that the Permissions Guide didn't help, you might want to do a [full and clean re-installation](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202539040) at this point.  This will ensure that the installation itself is not the root cause the problem.\n\nLet us know if it still doesn't help!","replies":[{"poster":"Mangala Nox","date":"2017-08-25T21:13:06.929+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Omg man ty soooo much is there a way I can have you more often your my favorite now ty so much it works now dude ty ty","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mangala Nox","date":"2017-08-25T02:29:27.745+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okey I give it a try I have to give him props he did do his best","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"AnataBakka","date":"2017-08-25T02:34:12.775+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"stop eating your words, it's too hard to understand","replies":[{"poster":"Mangala Nox","date":"2017-08-25T12:16:51.750+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol  not gonna retype the whole thing it's the same problem the dude did his best to help me gotta try it when I get home from work ","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Mangala Nox","date":"2017-08-25T01:51:10.924+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And sorry for getting heated man I'm just tired of seeing that message can't play with nobody I'm sitting here for 3 to 4 h piss off trying to figure out to do this","replies":[]}]}]}
