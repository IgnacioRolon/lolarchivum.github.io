The counter point is that these games are scripted and made one sided. Creating a game takes significant programming that the average person can not comprehend, let alone detect fraud.\n\nTo get this point poked out and make my argument stronger, I thought I would ask the league community (and hopefully a moderator for citation purposes) where these patches come from? Are they based on the LCS and there output on champions? Is it based on gaming statistics pulled from all the regions? What is the driving force behind a ban or nerf?\n\nThe paper is do by 11:30 (Central Time) April 18th! So I will be constantly refreshing this page for answers!\n\nThanks one and all!\n\nEDIT: Will post final draft when paper is finished. Its seems tiny because it was a word range of 900-1100 not counting citations.","replies":[]}
