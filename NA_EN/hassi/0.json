Because one of the things I like about a lot of old icons is that each icon usually had its own color, while nowadays each icon for a champion seems, in general, to be the same/similar color.\n\nA good example of this is Gragas's new icons, where each one is almost the exact same color (magenta). In fact when the icons are small or out of the corner of your eye Gragas's Q and E look the same.\n\nI much prefer Lux's color scheme for her icons where it goes gold (P), brown & gold (Q), blue (W), white blue & gold (E), and rainbow (R). Each icon is easy to tell apart.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Karma Deified","date":"2016-02-04T20:40:15.109+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Grag's pink abilities should be the same colour as passive.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Makuta Teridax","date":"2016-02-06T10:07:26.847+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can't believe no one's pointed Renekton, who was VU a long time ago now and still has those old outdated icons :P","replies":[{"poster":"Sahn Uzal","date":"2016-02-08T12:16:58.854+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Although I don't think they're too bad, I wouldn't mind new icons ;3\n{{summoner:31}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Tesla Effect","date":"2016-02-05T02:41:23.567+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Can someone explain to me why these Icons werent used already?\nhttp://img3.leaguecraft.com/skins/asset/skin_1442683555_760px_66033_1.jpg\nhttp://img1.leaguecraft.com/skins/asset/skin_1442683417_760px_66043_1.jpg\n\nIm curious as to why, they seem adequate.","replies":[{"poster":"Slushi Simcambi","date":"2016-02-05T16:44:38.907+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well if I had to guess, at a glance I can't really differentiate between each spell.\nEvery spell is a very similar color (or the same color for Anivia).\n\nThat's not a great reason but...","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Loomybinn","date":"2016-02-05T01:50:55.108+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Speaking of old ability icons, Mundo needs his fixed in the client.

We did 7 Marksmen in roughly 4 months last roster project, while this time we are targeting 6 Mages in roughly 6 months.
