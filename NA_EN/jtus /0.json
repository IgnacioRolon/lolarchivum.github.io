For example, I accidently dodged dynamic queue several times due to the lag not showing me champions to ban. My computer is by no means a bad one, a Lenovo Yoga  2 Pro with a Intel Core I7. I guess what I&#039;m asking is why is there so much lag and how can I or you fix it?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot a huevo","date":"2016-09-01T20:37:55.711+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"My guess is that you are talking about bad performance of the client and not actual lag, might be wrong. We know that the champion select screen is not as fast as it could be and we have a plan for improving its performance. We got a small team working exclusively on that ;)","replies":[{"poster":"BloodyTompon","date":"2016-09-02T10:11:57.773+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"May I ask what the performance comparison is like right now? I know eventually it will be optimised to use less than the current client, but do you have any simple metrics of comparison for the old and current? Is it using 90% of what the current client does on average or 130% - that kind of thing.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot a huevo","date":"2016-09-03T00:40:37.355+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Currently the updated client uses approximately the same amount of memory than the legacy client when the more resource intensive screens are being shown (ex. champ select). It is a pretty good place to be if you consider that the new UI is richer in design and effects.\n\nFor some simpler screens, memory consumption is about 30% lower than the legacy client. These are rough estimates from the top of my head, I don't know by memory all of the stats.\n\nIdeally, we would like to shutdown the UI completely while a game is in progress. That would lower memory consumption by 95% approximately, but that is not work in progress and we are still talking on how we could implement it.\n\nIn specific to the champ select screen, memory usage is not the biggest problem when it comes to improve current performance. One of the things that we need to polish is how the internal components that make up that screen communicate with each other.","replies":[{"poster":"BloodyTompon","date":"2016-09-03T01:25:06.928+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cool.
