I hit the quali for gold 4 recently, but then couldn&#039;t make it.  Notably though, the higher I got in gold, the better my team was.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m trying to focus on the support role solely because I consider it the most fun.\r\n\r\nHowever, in most games my top and mid just lose lane and my jungler doesn&#039;t gank once (I know, these are standard &quot;excuses&quot;, but it&#039;s true ;) ).\r\n\r\nMay I ask you to look at my stats for a second and tell me how you think I could improve my game? Am I overlooking something?\r\n\r\nI know that stats are a poor base to judge my playstyle, but pls have a look. Any help appreciated.\r\n\r\nBest\r\nKomlos","replies":[{"poster":"CounterSnipe","date":"2015-04-27T23:12:17.304+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"My advice to anyone seeking to climb the ladder is this - don't do it, it's a waste of time.\n\nThe best way to play LoL is to simply have fun, if you can, in solo q. \n\nIf you don't agree with me, consider this; many good players have a 55% win rate. So in order to get those wins, you would most likely have to play about a hundred games. So if you're able to win 10 more games than you lose (55-45 = 10 out of 100 games), then you would need to play several hundred games in order to climb a few divisions, let alone an entire league.\n\nIf you must support, I suggest doing it with an experienced ADC. Note that experienced doesn't mean high ranking. An adc that can get 70 CS at 10 minutes, and who has good judgement, would make a good duo partner.\n\nGood luck to you in your ladder climb.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FedAsFuk","date":"2015-04-27T22:02:59.231+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well I had this long shit typed out but power died, so now you get the short AF version.\n\n\nRoam to those feeding lanes, it is inefficient for the JG to gank thos elanes, but you get soloXP to your ADC and can turn the lane around.\n\nShotcall, carry through making sure everyone is on same page, Drag 1m, shove bot lane before baron, top outer is next objective, all of those are great.\n\nIf you think your being ganked, ask in chat for a counter gank, maybe the JG didn't see what you did, help him out, maybe he doesn't JG at all and is a bit lost (me most the time).\n\nKeep in mind you are the teams support, not the ADCs bitch, do what will help the team win.\n\nKeep everyone involved, tops feeding? Ask when their TP is up, say you will roam top on next back, little things like that show you give a fuck (should if you want to win) and can keep someone from tilting. Basically instead of feeling alone and like they are fucked, they will see their team is trying to help, to involve them, this goes a long way. \n\nLast thing, team fights, focus entirely on peel for carries, if they are alive and safe they will do a fuckton of damage, use this.","replies":[{"poster":"Komlos","date":"2015-04-27T22:54:40.513+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks so much Mezzie. This is very helpful advice, mostly because I'm not doing most of the things you say (except for dragon timing). Guess it comes down to better communication mainly. Will try. :)\n\nAlso, I figured my wards aren't as well-timed as they should be... do you guys follow any \"rules\", i.e. \"I always ward 2 objectives + 1 frequent path\" or something like that?\n\nI figured lately that Sona is doing pretty well. Not only do enemy adcs underestimate the Q poke but also if my adc falls behind early, I can simply outheal. However, the lack of CC doesnt really allow me to peel... When you wrote about peeling in TFs, I'd conclude you suggest playing heavy CC champs (Thresh, Leona, Ali, Braum). \n\nVery helpful comment so far, thank you.","replies":[{"poster":"FedAsFuk","date":"2015-04-28T21:31:50.602+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really only play Thresh support, and I think this is my lowest win rate account, 2 accounts in mid gold sitting around 75% win rates on Thresh, this one is 70?% But anyways the main point is don't want to look for DIVE supports ( Leo, Ali), they will take you away from a carry, making peeling very hard/unlikely.\n\nBut I honestly feel I would have the same win rate on any support, because especially when I am supporting I basically force myself into a shot calling position, the games I don't are usually the ones I lose.\n\nAs far as warding goes learn when you can and should place deep wards by the blue/red (bot side) it indirectly helps the top lane, if the enemy JG hasn't been seen on bots wards, top should back up.\n\n\nSupports I would recommend, Thresh, Braum (actually is a mid line support not a dive or backline), Morg, Janna (PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD), Lulu, Annie, Nami. Basically champs you can readily peel with. I would however also say Janna and Nami are really poor roaming supports, even Braum is not the best, it also depends on team comps.\n\nIf you have any questions feel free to leave them below and I will try to answer to the best of my abilities.\n\nAlso Annie Nashors tooth is a great split push support. Bit cheesy but friend of mine carried himself into mid plat from silver using Annie Nashors support.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Slayer1557","date":"2015-04-28T04:06:36.064+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Although I do not play ranked, I do consider my Support play (My main role) to be Gold level.  (I'm tempted to start now though...)\n\nI would say, just play who you are comfortable with, a LOT.  I'm personally not a fan of Braum, Thresh, Leona, etc, so I play all the ranged Supports.  Sona, Nami, Soraka, Janna, Zyra (oddly not Morgana).  The traditional support items (Talisman, Mikaels) are all well and good, but don't hesitate to go more AP focused.  I often go for something like Deathcap and Twin Shadows (Fantastic utility, MS, AP, OOOO so good).  I don't like Ardent Censure as much as you are getting it.  I get it rarely on Janna if I want to hyper-carry, my carry (Here, take this BF sword and a dagger :D ).  I find Sona benefits more from deathcap + sheen, into lichbane later.  Oh, and consider boots of swiftness, if you want to stay mobile in combat.  It depends.\n\nUtilize high MS to stay safe, with high AP to murderface things.  That's my strat, I suppose.","replies":[{"poster":"FedAsFuk","date":"2015-04-28T21:35:02.060+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"AP supports are fine, especially in soloQ, but I would recommend CDR boots. Mostly because you are not a high damage threat (lack gold to truly be a damage threat) and if you are choosing between swifties or CDR the extra spell rotations will do more good, although some champs will benefit more from mobis (usually good roaming supports). Just a thought.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Armstice","date":"2015-04-28T14:47:05.747+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have found that you need to realize when your adc  is a lost cause, go help someone else snowball or lose anyway.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Laraso","date":"2015-04-28T03:46:01.599+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you feel confident in your mechanics, you could try to learn {{champion:161}} support.
