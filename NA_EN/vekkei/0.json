Neither of those behaviors are allowed, _especially_ encouraging self-harm/suicide.\n\nEncouraging self-harm normally results in a 14-day suspension from the gate, assuming no prior punishment history, but clearly, you've had punishments before, and consequently, the only natural escalation was a permanent ban.","replies":[{"poster":"Vekkei","date":"2019-06-04T22:53:16.411+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":18,"body":"i never told anyone to kill themselves i said kys as in keep yourself safe, people have kys in their name and play on a normal basis, why aren't they banned? lol","replies":[{"poster":"ChaosReyn","date":"2019-06-04T23:15:13.660+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"What use is it to lie to a group of people who have no say regardless?\n\nOr was it more for yourself, to try one last time to pretend you're not taking things to unacceptable extremes?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Umbral Regent","date":"2019-06-04T23:13:46.323+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"> i never told anyone to kill themselves i said kys as in keep yourself safe...\n\nYeah, no. You don't get to dictate what you mean by the initialism, much less when your chat log is riddled with insults.\n\nYou told people to kill themselves.\n\n> people have kys in their name and play on a normal basis, why aren't they banned? lol\n\nWell, did you report them? If so, then the IFS will look at their behavior/screennames and punish accordingly.\n\nBut their behavior and punishment is irrelevant to yours.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Julevi","date":"2019-06-04T23:05:27.825+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kys is one of the most famous acronyms for \"kill yourself\" and the luck isn't with you as a lot of people tried justifying saying it with \"but it could mean other things\". \n\nBesides that: names containing this need to be reported or reviewed so a name-change will be handed out.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vreivai","date":"2019-06-06T02:21:54.731+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Normally I like to give people on here the benefit of the doubt, but based on the context there it's pretty clear that's not what you meant.\n\nAs far as people having kys in their name, report them via support ticket.
