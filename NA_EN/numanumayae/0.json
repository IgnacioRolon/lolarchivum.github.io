Promos to get into Silver 2 and my jg went AFK **after** the 3 minute mark. Specifically he went AFK after reaching lvl 5..so I wanna say around the 9ish minute mark. We wound up loosing and I lost my promo. Even though I was playing at my best and winning lane till enemy team figured out Lee (our jg) was AFK. \r\n\r\nI feel cheated. I feel like I was put in a hopeless situation and then punished for not winning. /Remake only works if AFK/disconnect from the beginning but if you are a troll that is beyond easy to work around.....just go AFK after 3 minutes. \r\n\r\nI propose a change: \r\n**/remake should work the whole game **\r\n1. /Remake can only be started if 1 or more members of either team has been AFK for longer then 4 minutes.\r\n2. If a team procs /Remake it will proc for both teams \r\n3. In order to /Remake both teams must agree to it \r\n4. Players who have been flagged as AFK will suffer the loss, irrespective of team. \r\n    EX. _2 players in Red are AFK &amp; 1 Blue is AFK. A Red starts /remake at 18 minute mark. /Remake appears for all 7 players. 5/7 must agree to /Remake. 3 Players suffer loss. 7 Players suffer no loss. Just wasted time. _\r\n\r\nI feel this will help a lot. With toxicity. Making player feel like this is a worth while investment.  \r\n\r\n\r\nPre-3 minute Remake will be unchanged.","replies":[{"poster":"NoRunesMasteries","date":"2016-09-06T16:38:01.033+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That will just allow trolls to troll hard...\n\ni.e. \n\n_game starts out okay but **Rek'Sai** doesn't want to carry her team who flames constantly and goes AFK_\nEnemy Team: \"Report Rek'Sai for AFKing/Leaving game\"\n_opts to /remake at 18:00 minute but only your team agrees (I highly doubt the enemy team would in this case want to waste the 18 minutes they played to remake because someone went AFK)  \n\nanother example of yours where more than two players total from both teams are both AFK, the winning team would likely try to fight it out as they know they can 4v4 since they're in the lead and thus they don't /remake at 35:00 minutes in.\n\nIf you're truly meant to climb you will get the promos back in no problem-o _**PLUS**_ you get a free win the next time you get into promos so even better.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2016-09-06T16:37:18.391+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"No, that is beyond abusable. That will actually make things more toxic than ever before. The team is losing so just have to have the one nice person afk for awhile... or a bunch of people and troll one person and flame him out of the match so they don't suffer a loss.","replies":[]}]}
