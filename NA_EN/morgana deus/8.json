Pretty bored.  Wish my skill mattered.  It doesn't.  \r\n\r\nGot reported every single game for complaining about the company's matchmaking.   Cause Riot puts people into negative situations and then punishes them when they're bored of having silver teammates against people who are diamond 2.   \r\n\r\nSure do love this company and the matchmaking.   \r\n\r\nSo when will I be allowed to play the game again and have real matchmaking?  Think we can get it back in season 9?","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-05-29T01:00:56.210+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://media1.tenor.com/images/f2d3829f9b349c9d9727789b1dc15761/tenor.gif","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dope Solo","date":"2019-05-29T01:07:30.330+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Next time Meddler opens a dev corner post, ask him to address the state of the matchmaker.","replies":[]}]}
