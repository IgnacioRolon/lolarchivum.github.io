Every single time one of these idiotic reworks happen somebody suffers.  \n\nI've been a one trick for 10 years.  10 years I have one tricked this champion.  In the past 12 hours I can't do anything but blind pick.  \n\nThe game is actually unplayable for me.  How long do I have to quit for?  A week?  A month?  The entire season?  \n\nJesus christ I just want to be able to play the god damn game.","replies":[{"poster":"Azeranth","date":"2019-03-07T10:54:40.073+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well here's a thought. You may be here to play a certain champion, but everyone else is here to play league of legends.\n\nIf you getting to play the champion how you want interferes with everyone else playing a fair, fun, and interactive game, then you can go pack sand.\n\nI haven't seen new Kayle, but old Kayle blew dick. Her kit was so badly designed, that the only way she could be even remotely balanced was to just get numerically dumpstered. That champion was so unfun to play against.\n\nYou either did nothing, and she was useless, and you won the game doing nothing.\n\nOr, you made a.mistake, Kayle got ahead, and she massacred everything while invulnerable and there was nothing you could do to stop it because the champion was \"balanced\" around not getting a lead.\n\nLearn new Kayle, learn a new champ, play League. If you're here to play Kayle of Legends, then you're not who they're designing for, and shouldn't be who they're designing for.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-03-07T08:31:18.998+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why can't you play Morg anymore?

It'll settle down pretty soon, probably a few days.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CauseSCIENCE","date":"2019-03-07T08:58:49.620+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Morgana Deus,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=te1U5Hpx,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2019-03-07T08:34:31.437+0000)\n>\n> Banned or picked in 100% of games.\n\nI think people forgot nothing changed with her except a visual update and they all just assumed she's new and should be permabanned 100% of the time.
