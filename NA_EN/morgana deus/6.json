I'm a plat 3 Morgana.   I was supporting a twitch who had an 18% win rate.  We got him 4 kills in lane and he was massively ahead. \r\n\r\nThe enemy team had a pantheon jungle.  I tell twitch to not over extend and stay back.  He refuses.  He repeatedly engages against the enemy team.  He repeatedly dies to pantheon ulting.  Literally 5 times he fell for the same trap.  We explained it to him.  He didn't listen.  \r\n\r\nBecause I played so well and did my job so perfectly this kid gave the enemy adc all kinds of shut down gold.  We ended up losing the game.  \r\n\r\nOne bad player decides the game.  It doesn't matter how incredible I am.  It doesn't matter how well I do my job as a support.  If I have the biggest idiot in the game on my team I will 100% Lose.  \r\n\r\nWhy is ranked even enabled?  Shut down the streams.  Shut down the ladders.  There's no point.

A good support wins lane, secures vision around objectives and after that he will win another lane. Try playing with a bad support vs a good one, you will be able to tell they have a ton of impact. Most of that isn't exactly obvious though, because it happens out of our sight or gets \"expected\".","replies":[{"poster":"Morgana Deus","date":"2019-02-25T06:02:46.527+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I did all of those things and still lost a game /shrug.
