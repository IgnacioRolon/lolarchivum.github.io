Please try logging in to the appropriate region.\"\r\n\r\nI have never, ever, changed regions.\r\n\r\nLogged in to the league of legends website, if I try to go to my settings page or even to check my support ticket, it asks me to login again and claims \"Sorry, we couldn't find that combination of username, password, and region\" despite this account always existing in this region.\r\n\r\nI have tried repairing the client and a complete fresh install. I get the same message. \r\n\r\nIt lets me reset my password on the website but even after confirming I have a North American account, resetting my password, which it lets me do, I still cannot login.\r\n\r\nI have a support ticket #23272066 but it won't even let me log back in to check it.\r\n\r\nI have emails from as far back as 2011. I never transferred regions. I do not know how to get back into my account.\r\n\r\nI have no idea how I am logged in now.\r\n\r\nWhat can I do?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-14T22:47:50.846+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I confirmed your ticket was submitted successfully.
