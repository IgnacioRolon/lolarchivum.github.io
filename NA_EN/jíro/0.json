There isnt and i feel there should be. There are many players who have had their main accounts permanently banned due to toxic behaviors, such as myself. Those with banned accounts have lost lots of money, playtime, and achievments with the loss of their accounts. I believe permanent bans with no chance of recovery to be harsh. I believe that riot should develope a system where those with permabanned accounts can get a special provisionary account that is monitored by riot and is on probationary status with restrictions set against toxicity and etc.. (Restrictions against what they were permabanned for). You should be able to use these accounts to play out over a certain period of time, say a year, and have them represent you reforming as a player and person for the better and proving you need an account permaban removed. It would make a lot of sense for those who lost their accounts to both have a chance to reform as a person or face consequences and to possibly acquire their accounts again. Does anyone else like this idea? If so lets have rioters see this. Please message me if youd like anymore ideas. Lets work towards reforming players and getting their accounts back.","replies":[{"poster":"Imperial Pandaa","date":"2019-09-28T00:53:53.895+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"So, we know of at least 2 separate unban experiments have been done by Riot. \n\nThe first we were told was a complete failure basically.

There isnt and i feel there should be.\n\n The reason there isn't anything in development regarding permabanned players is because of the two previous [**unban experiments held on NA.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/9356yc/why_are_people_in_na_having_their_permabanned/e3bbx8j/)\n\n(both times) A select group of players on NA were chosen to have their punishment status reduced from a permanent ban to a 14-day suspension. The first experiment resulted in a high failure rate (70-90%+) and the other never had it's results released (most players including myself assume it to be a failure for this reason.)\n\nAs of right now, Riot just doesn't have a reason to revert those correctly placed punishments.\n\n>Does anyone else like this idea?\n\n It would be nice to have my old account back, but there has to be _**real**_ consequences when it comes to the rules.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-09-28T01:56:56.078+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Riot has no interest in pouring resources into helping permabanned players.

Punishments have to be punishments or they're not effective. Every experiment done in this vein before has failed. Failed hard. For the few permabanned players who have actually reformed, their recourse is to start a new account.\n\nRiot has stated multiple times that **they are not interested in finding more ways for pemabanned players to continue playing - they want them to stop playing.** They had chances.
