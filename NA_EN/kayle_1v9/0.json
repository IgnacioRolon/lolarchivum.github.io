Getting 2 weeks ban right before season ends after like 3 months of clean behaviour. But hey. What do i know. I bet the silver 1 suport who picked Ashe as suport didn&#039;t get any punishment. I bet the Master tier shaco who went 0/10 and said he is #3 world shaco didn&#039;t get any punishment. I bet the enemy diamond MF who spammed easy all game while being fed by our 0/10 syndra didn&#039;t get any punishment. Try to carry games, try to do something in the vast sea of retards, get banned. Im done. If im getting 2 weeks ban for flaming they should be perma banned for feeding and trolling so i don&#039;t have to deal with at least one retard ever game.","replies":[{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2016-11-02T11:15:09.055+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Am I the only one who comes to this board to get a kick out of toxic players being punished and then whining about it?
