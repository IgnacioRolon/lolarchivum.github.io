You got punished because you negatively retaliated against them, and you got permabanned because you have a history of consistently behaving poorly and showed no effort to change. All you had to do was mute and report them but because you decided to be a jerk you got punished. From [Understanding the Tribunal](http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=2726400): \n\n>**4) That player in my game was far worse than me. Why am I banned???**\na) I'll keep this one simple: retaliation isn't OK. Reacting to a toxic player by being toxic just incites that player to be even worse--it also ruins the game for up to 8 other players. It is far, far worse to watch two people yelling at each other all game than it is to watch 1 player ranting into blank space. Almost everyone in the game can find someone out there that behaves worse than they do--but so what? Finding someone worse doesn't justify your behavior or justify retaliation. We expect more out of our players. What players often don't realize is... those other players in your game that you thought were worse? Nearly 100% of the time, those players were banned even before you were. If someone is being toxic, just report them and move on. If you retaliate, both of you will be banned. It's really that simple.\n\nNow if you want to actually discuss your ban then post your entire Reform Card here. Otherwise it's comments like this one that prove that your ban was deserved.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Twiggles","date":"2016-06-14T05:27:12.720+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is there a special spot in hell reserved for the person who triggered you?\nIdeally, yeah.\n\nIs it wise to use League's chat system to respond to obviously intentionally offensive assholes?\nNo, it really isn't.\n\nIf you had muted and reported them, you wouldn't be making this post right now. Believe me when I say I understand the urge to tell off people like that. However, the League chat really isn't the correct place to do that.\n\nAnd claiming Riot supports terrorism because of this is laughable at best. You broke League's rules by flipping out on the guy, and you were punished accordingly. It sucks that this happened to you, but it's something that could have been easily avoided. What the other person said is irrelevant in regards to your punishment, just as anything you said would be irrelevant to theirs.\n\nI can guarantee you that telling him off accomplished nothing because why should he care what you say? He's already made it clear that he's just out to piss people off. Letting him know he's succeeding in doing that isn't improving matters.\n\nThe Orlando shooting was a national tragedy. I know it, you know it, and I guarantee you that the asshole from your League match knows it. The difference between the two of you is that you are very passionate about the issue, and he was looking to use it for a sick laugh. You are a distinctly better person than he is, but that doesn't exempt you from Riot's rules within the context of their game.\n\nIn closing: Don't try to fight edgelords with anger. It only makes them stronger, because it's exactly what they are looking for.","replies":[{"poster":"FurriesAreHot","date":"2016-06-14T10:59:36.630+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Twiggy butt for blue!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"x R e n g a R x","date":"2016-06-14T04:43:09.724+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why do you feel the need to talk to other people on a game that you're suppose to be engaged in?\n\nThe more people type the less engaged you are in the game...\n\nSomeone can just be saying that for 'shits and giggles' and doesn't really mean it. But he got you to react and you paid for your own consequences.\n\nReform or go to another game.\n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"KVbqbFsC8e","date":"2016-06-14T04:25:18.217+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The system is completely automated, it doesn't care what anyone else said or did.","replies":[]}]}
