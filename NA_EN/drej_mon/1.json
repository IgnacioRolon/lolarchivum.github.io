I&#039;ve always been a positive player and I&#039;ve invested hundred of dollars into this game.  Now apparently I can&#039;t play for 14 days??  Because I &quot;fed intentionally&quot; for 1 game?  We all have bad games.  I played new the malzahar for my first time in normals and got camped. I realize now I&#039;m bad at this new version of the champion, but seriously riot.  Please remove this 14 day ban as it is very bizarre and uncalled for.  I&#039;d hate to be turned off this game because of this situation, and hope you can swiftly rectify it.  If not, please refund my the money I&#039;ve invested because I&#039;m not satisfied with your product Riot.  Ban people who repeatedly troll, not someone who&#039;s been playing since season 1 and has one bad game.

I just can't believe that a plat level player wouldn't understand the concept of playing safe when behind. Playing safe isn't dying literally once per minute. Nobody else on your team had that issue. \n\nAlso, it's highly unlikely that you got punished for the Malz game that ended a couple hours ago.
