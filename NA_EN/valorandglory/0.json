Otherwise I would suggest keeping that effect in mind for if you make a Legendary or even Ultimate skin for him because I personally thought that effect was awesome, but yeah that is just my opinion. Now my opinion about the skin set as a whole is they work together quite nicely but is there going to be more &quot;Gravelord&quot; like skins so they have like a &quot;Rival&quot; set of skins? Maybe something like Gold Dragon Shyvanna or maybe &quot;Unholy amalgam Urgot&quot; if you guys are planing on keeping up with the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;/&quot;Dungeons and Dragons&quot; Fantasy theme.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-11-16T21:39:16.233+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hiya! \n\nThanks for the report! \n\nThis is a texture override issue that should be resolved soon! \n\nFor bugs on the PBE, the best place to report them is [here](http://pbr.pbe.leagueoflegends.com/pbe/en_BE/bugReport/create)! :] It helps us better keep track of issues on PBE versus live.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CannonBeast","date":"2015-11-13T21:17:17.754+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're on the Live bug forums.","replies":[{"poster":"ValorAndGlory","date":"2015-11-13T21:22:31.416+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=CannonBeast,realm=NA,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=HimUxBkc,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-11-13T21:17:17.754+0000)\n>\n> You're on the Live bug forums.\n\nthis is where a red redirected me, plus anytime I try to get the PBE boards I get Redirected to the normal boards.","replies":[]}]}]}
