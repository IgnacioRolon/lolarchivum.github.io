Randomly throughout the use of my mouse it will start moving my character just by moving my cursor on the screen.  It will stop allowing me to right click move and instead will just follow my mouse cursor around.  It causes me a ton of issues quick casting for last hits and panning my camera.  \r\n\r\nI am not sure what to do.  It only happens with my Logitech G900 regardless if its wireless or wired.  I have no idea what to do at this point.  \r\n\r\nPlease help me.\r\n\r\nTroubleshooting already performed:\r\n\r\n-Restarted the computer\r\n-Restarted the game\r\n-Removed and reinstalled League\r\n-Removed Logitech software and reinstalled\r\n\r\nI just can't figure it out.  I have reset all default settings in game and on the mouse in addition to creating a new profile for the mouse to use.  \r\n\r\nNothing I do fixes it.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-23T19:50:11.962+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your mouse may be acting up, or maybe even a driver or software being used for it.
