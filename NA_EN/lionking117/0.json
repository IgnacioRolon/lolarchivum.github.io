Tell me what you think.","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"So thats cool theres a chat restriction but if you have ever been in the 5th level of your division it won&#039;t help because a lot of people don&#039;t care enough and choose to troll anyway. \r\nInstead of restricting those offenders that do that in Ranked why not enforce a ranked restriction. If you can&#039;t act right don&#039;t play ranked. Im not a just ranting because of where I am at. I just think theres a better way to deal with trolls. That being said the restrictions should require the offender to play x number of normal games that don&#039;t conclude with them trolling. If they continue to troll they will receive a chat restriction also with the rank restriction. If they continue to offend by feeding intentionally and afking the offender will receive a 2 day ban. They only receive one of theses ban warnings. If they continue to troll after and beyond the 2 day ban the account is then banned completely.","replies":[{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2015-04-26T04:01:47.498+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm fairly certain this already exists.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Occams Raiser","date":"2015-04-26T08:51:02.910+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If it exists, its not used.","replies":[]}]}
