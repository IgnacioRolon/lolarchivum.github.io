The clense summoner doesn&#039;t remove it since its not a debuff or a disable according to riot, and in my opinion is just a waste of a summoner just because it can&#039;t remove ALL cc, and its not like you can zhonya during the suppression. So it comes down to positioning smart, which is something everyone should try to do anyways I know, and hoping you have someone on your team with {{item:3222}} that will save you... JK that doesn&#039;t even work. So even if you position somewhat safely you&#039;re still at risk of a flash suppress and guess what? At least to me, there is no response to that as a mage since you can&#039;t zhonya it, you can&#039;t clense it, your supportive team mates can&#039;t remove it, and you can&#039;t out position a flash that easily. So what does a mage buy/do? And why is clense such a bad summoner? Full discolsure, I am a silver support main but this seems kind of unfair for mages who either have to waste an item slot for an item that won&#039;t build into anything they can use, or they pray that their team can bail them out, but in my elo those prayers go unanswered quite a bit of the time.","replies":[{"poster":"Zane Zephyr","date":"2017-01-29T02:56:05.222+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cleanse doesn't remove suppression because you can't use summoner spells during suppression, lol. \n\nHave you ever watched any LCS game with a malzahar in it?
