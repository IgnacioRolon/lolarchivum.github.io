I'm not here to say I am the best player in the division and that I belong in diamond, but its really frustrating when I try to pick utility champs and then my team can't take advantage of that, or if I do well with someone who does damage and my team goes off and dies because of no wards/trying to 3v5/generally bad decisions. I'm not saying I don't make mistakes, because I am very much prone to bad calls just like anyone else, but should I just give up on utility or top lane all together in silver? It just doesn't seem worth playing since it seems to depend an awful lot on your team making good decisions consistently or else you're sitting there trying to save a turret 1v4 or 1v5.","replies":[]}
