It is too hard to actually get a single thing. There is no guaranteed award unless you own 80% of all champions. What&#039;s the point of the system then? To troll people, especially noobs, who skip free rotation champions, and grind their 3-7 champions trying to get free skins, by giving them some kind of old, awful, 500~ RP skin for a champion they haven&#039;t even played yet? I&#039;d rather have no loot system at all, instead of being trolled over and over again with absolute nonsense drops.\r\n\r\n I am not begging for a better drop rates or something, but at least you should make re-roll system a thing. At the moment, if you re-roll 3 skin shards to get a permanent, guess what, you just waste 2 skin shards to get a permanent 500 RP legacy skin shard for a champion you do not own/do not play/ have not played, which you will end up discarding or re-rolling again. This is like spitting at your players. I think re-roll should be a guaranteed skin for a champion you actually own, because landing a skin shard for a champion you like , especially for people who do not have a lot of champions is way too hard, when there are like 500+ skins.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------\r\nTLDR - make skin re-roll a guaranteed skin for a champion you actually own.","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-06-26T09:21:35.853+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Stop complaining about free stuff, be happy you get anything at all.","replies":[{"poster":"Mcemc","date":"2017-06-26T09:55:50.462+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"The point is that you actually don't get anything at all, you just get trolled.

Plus the system is extremely unwelcoming to new players, because a lot of them skip free rotation champions to get free cool skins, and in the end all they get is legacy skins for champions they have never played, which end up as orange essence.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MrHaZeYo","date":"2017-06-26T09:03:18.252+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Lol, free is free man.
