The bubble lands right on top of a champion (or two, or three), but nothing happens. It&#039;s as if the bubble missed. This happened multiple times against Janna and Leona, which makes me think it might be an incorrect interaction with shields. Their shields shouldn&#039;t block the bubble like Morgana&#039;s Black Shield would, but the effect is identical. Braum&#039;s shield seems to &quot;catch&quot; Nami&#039;s bubble, so I haven&#039;t noticed any problem against Braum. The bubble has also failed against non-shielded enemies. In my last two games, it&#039;s failed against an Ezreal, a Corki, and a Nidalee. No jumps/dashes were attempted when the bubbles failed, but all those champions do have movement skills.\r\n\r\nAt first, I was hesitant to call this a bug, because it&#039;s easy to mistake where a skill shot lands. However, in my last game alone, I counted at least 4 bubble failures. At the very least, the range indicator is flawed, if no other bug is occurring.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-09-12T19:33:40.952+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey! \n\nI'm a fellow Nami main who spams her in ranked. ^-^ I've personally not seen this issue - I've been able to land my bubbles (most recently against an Ezreal/Janna). \n\nI may suggest what balbraaksel did and grab a replay. It'd be easier to get a feel for what's going on.
