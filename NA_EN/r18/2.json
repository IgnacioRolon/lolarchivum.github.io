I speculate that the Camille was the person the robot, Orianna, was supposed to copy.\r\n\r\nHere&#039;s my reasoning:\r\n\r\n1. Orianna and Camille both a bun in their hair. Camille&#039;s is noticeable in some parts of the comic (p. 4) and they both have blue eyes (Even though they are robotic, there&#039;s likely a reason for this)\r\n2. Orianna was from Piltover, while Camille is from Zaun. Both technological advanced cities. There is a lot of revival in previous champion lores, and seeing that Piltover is Right above Zaun, and it might be the case here.\r\n3. Unlike Orianna, Camille is likely a cyborg because she understands feeling and emotion, unlike the coldblooded machine. If reason 2 is correct, this is likely as well.\r\n\r\nAnswers to counterarguments:\r\nQ. Camille has white hair, while Orianna had blonde/brown hair.\r\nA. Pigment goes away. If you&#039;ve died, or had excessively high stress levels, you may go through something known as Marie Antionette Syndrome. (Tokyo Ghoul :D)\r\n\r\nQ. Wasn&#039;t Orianna a ballerina?\r\nA. Yes, but Camille&#039;s robotic legs enforce the link between them further. In the comic, Camille moves and fights  _elegantly_, like a dancer.\r\n\r\nQ. Why would Orianna (original) kill?\r\nA. Well, in the comic, she betrayed Volkage possibly in a fit of rage, and quote _&quot;No one stays innocent forever&quot;_ This is my most concrete evidence, as it displays the transformation from dancer, to killer.\r\n\r\n\r\nI know this PROBABLY isn&#039;t correct, but I am pretty sure they have SOME sort of link to one another","replies":[{"poster":"Crimson Cupcake","date":"2016-11-18T19:31:23.036+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"While I know Orianna is a not copy of Camille, I do think that they will be closely related. When I saw the picture for the reveal that was my initial thought. \n\n\"She looks related to Orianna.\" \n\nHowever, the Orianna we know (the robot) is based off of a real girl, also named Orianna, that died young due to sickness. Her father, in his grief, created a beautiful, perfect, exact copy of her (at least in his eyes, as this is very much not the case). When we look at the tech that went into robot Orianna though, we see some similarities, as mentioned above. \n\nMy theory on this is that perhaps the loving father who crafted Orianna, is the very same man who assisted Camille in her augmentation. I might be totally wrong, but I think this situation would be very interesting if proven correct.\n\nTL;DR Orianna is not based off of Camille. The real Orianna is dead and the Orianna we know is a robot version of her.","replies":[{"poster":"R18","date":"2016-11-18T20:46:53.025+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"About the naming, I'm pretty sure you'd use an alias after death.

The theory that Camille is actually the original Orianna, which got saved from death by an operation making her a cyborg, is really interesting and has potential. I don't think we will ever know, but it is one of these theories that could actually be while having no real proof.\n\nBut to correct some stuff:\n1. Camille seems to be from Piltover, not Zaun.\n2. She didn't \"betray\" Baron Volkage. She seems to be some kind of dark knight or special agent, killing targets who are dangerous for the peace of Piltover.\n\nNot weakening your arguments, just pointing it out to be correct.\nThe reasoning that her fighting style could remind of a dancer and the line \"no one stays innocent forever\" are really good points. Well spotted.\n\nSomeone in here saw Mardock Scramble? ^^\nCould be a scenario like this. Someone from Piltover secret service made her an offer to save her life, but she has to accept to get transformed into a cyborg and of course she has to work for them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"reaperteaser","date":"2016-11-18T00:15:57.903+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i'll ship it","replies":[]},{"poster":"TyrekGoldenspear","date":"2016-11-17T23:52:33.915+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The plot thickens....","replies":[]}]}
