And I know it surprises some people now, but they were both meant to be 'grey' in different ways. You'd have to use the WaybackMachine to find the old pages for the factions, but yeah, to me finally I start to see that meritocratic free community Noxus was supposed to be (although they were also described as xenophobic back then which made no sense even back then).\n\nAnyway, so it did give this old-lore fart a kick to see a reference to the Fleshing. Ah, nice to see some barbaric traditions are still around in reworked Noxus, heh. Could we see an {{champion:12}} or {{champion:5}} story update in future in relation to their experiences in the Fleshing?\n\n{{champion:7}} turning out to have orchestrated the _actual creation of the Noxus empire_ after disposing of Mordekaiser ? Interesting so in a sense that would make the sort-of...**Mother of Noxus** in some sense. I didn't expect her to be _that_ entrenched in Noxus' history, intriguing! Also makes me wonder if she had a hand in the creation of other nations.\n\nAlso now she could be the sugarmommy to {{champion:50}} ? Naice. Though somehow I don't expect it to be as straightfoward as, she's literally a centuries old woman. Maybe women. Hms.\n\nI kinda laughed at how she's all covered up (_LeBurqa _), but I can see  the practicality of it - I mean, she definitely need a VGU eventually and now you don't have to ever come back to rewrite how she looks in the stories! Also in-story, she could use any kind of proxy and noone would know while she remotely controls and monitors everything from some basement (_NeckBlanc_!)\n\nI think there's still parts of Swain's history that's not shown to us yet, such as the actual moment/encounter he has with the demon presumably down in the Halls of the Dead. Will that be in the form of additional stories, a comic, or being left as ambiguous for now?\n\nThere's also this disconnect I feel with regards to how the knowledge of his powers doesn't seem as well-known as you'd think? I mean, in the dev diary, when they spoke about how 'magic is another tool', we pan on a shot of Swain displaying his arm. But in the stories, we're actually shown that he makes a conscious effort to conceal it until the right time, or that it's very much not commonly known. Not all his generals knew for example, and in the Ironspike Mountains, they heard of his injuries from Ionia but not of his recovery or his newfound powers.\n\nHow exactly does Swain wield his powers on the battlefield in this case? It seemed the practical thing would be for him to go ahead and lead the battles, but apparently this is not the case. Rank-and-file soldiers would gossip and spread such tales as their Grand General being able to shoot red lightning, and having wings. But again, this doesn't seem to be the actual case. Could a Rioter shed some light on this?\n\nSome friends I've discussed with are kinda disappointed at {{champion:91}} 's complete absence from updates, is there anything planned for him to be part of the overarching story that seems to include other Noxians (even Urgot)?\n\nOverall, great to see the updates, and even if its greedy, I hope there's more to come as well.
