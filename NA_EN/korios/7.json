For example the cowgirl skin has pistols similar to what we see in the short. We also don't know the circumstances behind the guns.

While it shows a story, it's a story that got scrapped and the cinematic not maid.  Which means this animatic is not canon at all, which is why she has regular pistols.  This is a rought draft for a cinematic they never went with, so a lot of things won't fit right.  \n\nThe type of guns there don't fit Bilgewater.\n\nMF's hair doesn't have the same kind of bounce or wavy texture.\n\nIf they were working on a cinematic and needed a concept to work through, they wouldn't add all the detail the final one has in the first take, right?  Why make extravegant curved guns and flintlocks, when the shape of a generic pistol is easier to jot down and move onto the next frame.  This isn't a story of what has occurred. It's an attempt to try and figure out her character, and how she would be in certain situations.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"HalcyonDweller","date":"2017-05-16T18:42:14.674+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Very cool animation!\n\nI do take issue with the spider though.

I'm TreblMuffin. I do sound stuff for a whole bunch of our cinematic work. It looks like you're not alone in misunderstanding a bit of what this piece is, and what the Workshop is trying to show. Let me take you on a journey! *motions over shoulder as rainbows and beautiful horse-dog creatures appear from the sky*\n\nWhat this video kind of shows is a slice of our work as we see _on the way_ to a polished state for players. I actually have a lot of the same thoughts as you and many people in the thread when I get a first look at a cinematic. Half the time I'm looking at blocks and half sketched board-o-matics _before it even gets to look like this!_ Imagine trying to concept sound for a Zaun shotgun when it's just a chunky grey set of lines! Is it pump loading? What does it shoot? What's it made out of? How \"Used\" is it?\n\nIn general there's a few different milestones where we refine aspects of a cinematic. Surrender is basically an **animatic**, which tells us if pacing and plot points are working, making sense, and resonating. Artists do their best to render out important pieces of the scenes, but at this stage, and especially for people like me, it's more important to get a sense of how the action moves and where major narrative beats are.\n\nIn my opinion, which is certainly questionable haha, Surrender is a darker exploration of who Fortune is. It deepens her character and, to me, makes her more interesting than the bubbly gun wieldin' gal you get in game. There's some kind of creepy gritty resolve to do dirty work and deal with the demons later in this. Honestly, she scares me. But I'm also in love with her.
