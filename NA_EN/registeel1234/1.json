Normal ADC page is 2 AS quints and 1 AD, you are basically sacrificing 4ish AD for 4% AS, trading an minuscule amount of damage for 2-3 more autos in a trade (especially combined with proper use of W). The damage added at level 2 is equal to an extra 10-15 AD if i recall the exact math correctly","replies":[{"poster":"Registeel1234","date":"2015-03-01T00:54:50.801+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"interesting, I might trya setup like this, thx for the basic explanation","replies":[{"poster":"FedAsFuk","date":"2015-03-01T00:55:43.755+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you want add me, I don't ADC much anymore but I can still help with Draven in particular","replies":[{"poster":"Registeel1234","date":"2015-03-01T01:00:40.808+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sure, I have some problems when it comes to chasing enemies with Q :S","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"FedAsFuk","date":"2015-03-01T00:54:28.730+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Correction you are trading 2.25 AD for 4.5% AS...concept still applies but the numbers for the AD quint was wrong","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"EndlessSorcerer","date":"2015-02-28T21:04:02.091+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You probably don't need to have separate pages whose only difference is Magic Pen vs Hybrid Pen.  Hybrid Pen is efficient in most cases and is close enough to Magic Pen otherwise that the difference is minor.  I'm referring to pages 2 and 3, if it matters.\n\nI'd honestly recommend using Hybrid Pen instead of Magic Pen in pretty much every case, to save rune pages if for no other reason.\n\nYou don't really need an AD and AP page for many champions, since there are usually more efficient setups.  Is this one for Evelynn?\n\nPossible Pages:\n\n* Attack Speed Quints, Attack Speed Marks, Flat Armor Seals, Scaling MR Glyphs  [Autoattack Junglers like Warwick or Master Yi]\n* Health Regen Quints, Attack Damage or Hybrid Pen Marks, Flat Armor Seals, Flat/Scaling MR Glyphs [Good for weak early top laners]\n* Flat Armor Quints, Scaling Armor Seals, Scaling MR Glyphs, Attack Damage or Hybrid Pen Marks [Good against Riven, Zed, etc]\n* Flat MR Quints, Scaling Health Seals, Flat MR Glyphs, Attack Damage or Hybrid Pen Marks [Good against Rumble, Leblanc, etc]\n* Flat CDR Quints, Flat CDR Glyphs, Attack Damage Marks, Flat Armor Seals [Nasus]\n\nYou can look at my rune pages is you want other ideas.","replies":[{"poster":"Registeel1234","date":"2015-03-01T00:31:54.015+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thx a lot for you suggestions.
