Firstly, is it normal for new players to be ranked up vs others with 500+ wins even though they're bronze?\nI mean sometimes i feel like it's completely unfair matchups that the more you play the more you go down.\n\nIs it possible that there's something wrong with my client or the matchup system is completely separate?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2018-01-05T21:58:16.618+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, welcome!  Matchmaking will prioritize your rating and not necessarily how many games they've played.  As you continue to play, matchmaking will continue to adjust you until it finds a placement best fit for you.  As you continue to win, you may find more challenging opponents and vice versa.  Each game mode also has their own matchmaking so your rating in normal could be completely different from ranked.  I hope that helps clear things up, but more info is also available in our[ matchmaking guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752954-Matchmaking-Guide) too!","replies":[{"poster":"shakeelthomas","date":"2018-01-05T22:15:14.559+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So it's fine to be paired with others with hundreds of wins even though i have like single digits?\nI feel like i didn't experience the 'protect new players' priority at all.

It's not your client or anything like that, just matchmaking.  It will continue to adjust as you keep playing, though, and put you in a comfortable spot.  \n\nI can imagine playing against players who have a lot of games in could be distressing, but matchmaking has placed them with you based on skill.
