Like is gargoyle plate not sufficient for this?\n\nI guess if I had to list out what I thought:\n\n- Having a short \"second life\" instead of a full-on revive means the item doesn't need its astronomical 5 minute cooldown where it kinda feels like dead weight in your inventory.\n\n- Making it a resistance item (again) instead of an AD item so it's not a win-more item for any AD champion who's ahead enough to buy it. It's almost purely a luxury item because its build path isn't exactly good for most ADs that fall behind _(particularly if you can't afford the B.F. Sword it needs)_.\n\nI don't think it's too big an issue if there's some overlap with Gargoyle Stoneplate. Plate is a proactive item, to reinforce against initial burst, while this item would give a tank an extra moment to help his team after he gets taken down. \n\nPlus, items that actually trade damage for utility never hurt.\n\n_(Also, it seems to me like Gargoyle Stoneplate's mostly built for the Cho'Gath R one-shots, or on Sion because lul infinite HP.)_","replies":[{"poster":"LilxPaprika","date":"2018-10-25T19:51:44.325+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ætheist,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=NoqeFV9V,comment-id=00030000,timestamp=2018-10-25T19:04:03.866+0000)\n \n> _(Also, it seems to me like Gargoyle Stoneplate&#x27;s mostly built for the Cho&#x27;Gath R one-shots, or on Sion because lul infinite HP.)_\n\nthis could be fixed if it's not viable on enough champions, see this: \nhttps://docdro.id/qG5Y6Ka\n\nit's a really long post I submitted to Gameplay + \n\nI'm not putting down your idea, I just don't think it's a necessity thing, more preference. \nthen again fun factor is always a needed thing. so it might be more fun, and I could def see it at least tried in like aram or something. mix it up some.
