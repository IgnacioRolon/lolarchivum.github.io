The affliction causes them to take [10% of the applying ability&#039;s damage] as bonus Magic Damage on-hit from Kog&#039;Maw&#039;s basic attacks.\r\n\r\nSubsequent ability hits will either refresh the acid&#039;s duration or enhance it if the new ability hit is stronger than the last.\r\n\r\nKog&#039;Maw&#039;s basic attacks will refresh the duration of Icathian Acid on targets, but if the acid expires on a target, they become immune to it for a short time.\r\n\r\n/-/-/\r\n\r\nWhen it says [10% of ability&#039;s damage], I mean that 10% of that ability&#039;s damage and scaling become on-hit magic damage versus that target. \r\n\r\nAs an example, rank 3 Caustic Spittle does 180 (+50% AP) damage. Landing it would thus grant Kog 18 (+5% AP) on-hit magic damage on that target for a short time.\r\n\r\nMight have to adjust some of his other numbers a bit, particularly Bio-Arcane Barrage. \r\n\r\nIt&#039;s a bit more spell-weavy, but that&#039;s not entirely unheard of. Kog actually used to build Trinity Force back in the day, after all.\r\n\r\nI just think Kog needs a non-death passive is all, and for Nashor&#039;s Tooth to not be a bad item for him _(seriously, being the mainly magic-damage-dealing auto-attacking marksman with almost entirely AP scalings, Nashor&#039;s SHOULD be good on him like it is on Kai&#039;Sa)_.","replies":[{"poster":"Zeppelins circus","date":"2018-11-07T10:51:23.208+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"He has a LOT of stuff gained by levelling the abilities.

That is his true passive.\n\nThat's why I figured you'd dial back on some of that in the process of giving him an actual passive.\n\nI suggested a passive like this because Kog not having any AP scaling flat magic damage on-hit _(like Kai'Sa's passive)_ is the only thing I can see keeping him from being able to use Nashor's effectively. \n\nI just don't like it when champions don't have real passives. I mean, Kog isn't TECHNICALLY passive-less _(like Syndra, who doesn't have a passive anymore now that Darius and Akali have \"unlock at rank 5\" perks on some skills innately)_, but the passive he does have doesn't match his usage in the slightest and just feels tacked on.\n\nAlso wanting more champions that can viably use Nashor's. It's only bought by four champions currently, and Kog's basically right on the verge of being able to viably use it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Spicy Rice","date":"2018-11-07T15:19:08.519+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thing is, if you buffed/changed his passive in any way, you'd have to nerf the rest of his kit, which is honestly really really strong when the meta is in his favor (meaning champs who can protect him are meta).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rathar Dashing","date":"2018-11-07T23:21:22.146+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think giving him a really minor passive in addition to his current passive would be nice.

In higher elo games where people die less, it punishes players for not getting caught out. It's the weirdest on Kog, whose entire kit revolves around being out of range. This means that if he ever did get caught out, he wouldn't be able to get to a squishy and do some extra damage anyway since they'd be far away.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2018-11-07T15:23:15.300+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just let his current passive affect turrets, and we'd have inting splitpushing Kog.
