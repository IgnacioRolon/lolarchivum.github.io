Especially when old Aatrox was countered by Thornmail _(or even just Bramble Vest)_ harder than anyone else in the game.\r\n\r\nLike, for other reworked champions I can see some of the charm in their old kits, but I&#039;m just not seeing anything in old Aatrox besides him being a different flavor of Xin Zhao (dive in, knock up the enemy, and auto until either somebody dies or you get CCed, while having bonus healing/damage every third hit).\r\n\r\nHell, I had someone try to tell me that Aatrox&#039;s old E wasn&#039;t a poke spell, when it&#039;s the textbook definition of a poke spell.","replies":[]}
