The issue is being caused by the **Adobe Air** client that a stubborn Riot continue to use instead providing to their customers a **real game client**.\n\nRiot doesn't even read the ticked that you will send, will just ask you to provide more informations on your system, suggest you to disable the firewall (or even uninstall it!!) or suggest you to disable portions of your system (IP Helper used to surf the web, for example) they are not really trying to resolve the issue but just hiding the real cause.\n\n**What can we do**; in short words the only solution to RP loss / ban prevention is **stop playing the game** cause they are well aware of this problem with Adobe Air client, the problem has not been resolved in a so long time, so what makes you think that they will do now? Of course **they will not resolve it until people keep playing and paying for the game**.","replies":[{"poster":"Dagvaar","date":"2014-12-04T14:59:21.703+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"**SOLUTION (?)**: This seemed to work for me, Adobe Air logs indicates that the error might be related to the market. Here are the steps that I have followed to resolve the error:\n\n1. open the game and login\n2. before doing anything else click the **Market** icon\n3. wait it to load then click **Champions** tab\n4. once loaded click on **Profile** icon\n5. Now play a game, also in draft mode!\n\nIt is important to never start a game while you are in the market, always start from your profile.","replies":[{"poster":"MrPickl3","date":"2014-12-04T16:25:30.631+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can't even log in to try this","replies":[{"poster":"Hanky Spanky","date":"2014-12-04T16:33:01.330+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same i cant log into the game at all.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Dagvaar","date":"2014-12-04T16:27:50.356+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"**EDIT**: its happening again, so my solution doesnt works :( they just have some horrible server and seems they like to change IP every that often, add to this the **Adobe Air** shit as client and here you will be unable to determine who is causing what.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"SpaceClown","date":"2014-12-04T13:04:10.267+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same thing.
