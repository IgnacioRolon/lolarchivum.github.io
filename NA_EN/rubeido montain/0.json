There is no reason to have item bans.  if a certain item proves to be ridiculously good (to the point where it was very hard to punish) across  a large sample of games, then riot will nerf it. Good examples of this are steraks gage, guinsoos rageblade, rapid firecannon, statikk shiv, and frost queens claim. Duskblade has a 2 minute cooldown and can be removed via qss. Only a small pool of champions can really utilize this item to its full potential. Its not a big deal.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Anraton","date":"2016-03-07T12:02:06.561+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Funny idea ...
