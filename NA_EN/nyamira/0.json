I saw this was an issue in 2015, but didn't see anything about a fix. I'm currently stuck with one ward skin. Please let me know if there's a way to fix. \r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nNya","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-24T04:38:06.434+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmmmm I went ahead and checked out your account and I do see those 5 different ward skins available. There might be some kind of corrupted file with the ward skin you're stuck on, so let's first see if a client repair will fix that up. Go into the client settings and hit Initiate Full Repair. Let me know if you're still stuck with ol' Pengu!","replies":[{"poster":"Nyamira","date":"2017-04-25T15:41:08.598+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey!\n\nI think it worked, I didn't have a chance to check if it was just an issue in the Legacy client before it was retired. BUT anyways, I can change wards now. \n\nThank you!! \nNya","replies":[]}]}]}
