Does actively trying to be positive in chat help faster progress your honor? such as telling your team not to ff\r\n2. How long does it take for you to climb out of Honor 1?  or Just climb from an honor to the next in general. How many games you play in a day for how long?\r\n3. Does winning or losing games affect how much honor i progressed after game\r\n4. Lastly Honor 5s give me some tips xD","replies":[{"poster":"Silent Gravity","date":"2018-10-11T02:56:59.759+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Silent Gravity,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=B0RzOAVm,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-10-10T03:01:32.509+0000)\n>\n> \n> \n> The primary way to get honor is by playing games without being validly reported.\n> \n> This means that avoiding everything that can be flagged as negative is a good idea. No \"pointing out\" anyone's KDA or CS. Don't say that you're going to report or mute anyone. When you decide that someone is trolling/griefing, stop interacting with them. Don't blame people for the state of the game.\n> ------------------\n> \n> The second most important way to gain honor is by using chat positively. This can start with simple things like \"gl hf\" at the beginning and \"gg\" at the end. More advanced techniques include using chat to help your team win the game. Make plans for the future. \"We should get a ward on baron\" \"Take dragon while they're distracted\" \"Build XX next for some MR\" \"focus LeBlanc first next fight\" \"Hold your ult until after they use their dashes\"\n> \n> While you are doing this, make sure that you're talking about the future. The future can be changed, but the past cannot. \"Why didn't you ward baron?\" \"You should have taken dragon while I had them distracted\" \"Why did you build XX?\" \"stop focusing the tank\" \"stop wasting your ult\" Those, while essentially the same message as the prior ones, are flagged as negative because the past can't be changed.\n> \n> ------------------------------------\n> \n> The third most important way to gain honor is the team bonus for everyone honoring someone. This means that it's best for you to honor someone every game. This also helps you to enjoy the game itself more. It focuses our thinking on what went right, and who we enjoyed playing beside the most, instead of focusing on the troll, flamer, or uncooperative person.\n> \n> ----------------------------\n> \n> The smallest part of gaining honor comes from the individual honors. Focusing on those is a good way to make yourself frustrated.","replies":[]},{"poster":"breakordoom444","date":"2018-10-11T02:46:09.636+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because I have no emotion to any person on the boards other then Deep Terror Nami, i will answer your questions unbiased(if there is something i can be biased about)\n\n1: Yes and No, yes because positivity often lead to more honors, and honour= +, no because doing it doesn't give you anything, it requires other players to feel that you deserve the honor.\n\n2: doing my research (inting, being toxic and getting myself a 14 ban on an alt with friends to minimize the damage), it took me 3 weeks to get from 0 > 1\n\n3: yes and no, yes if you carried or was very important in the match, you will get more honors, but no because you can be a god at the game and still lose because of your 1/52/2 \"diamond smurf\" yasuo.\n\n4:try and only talk when your teammates do something(kill,First turret), and don't talk alot, but don't be silent.\nengage some meme convos with the enemy, they like it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Umbral Regent","date":"2018-10-11T02:27:48.950+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1) As far as we know, positive behavior can probably help improve Honor progression, though I wouldn't suggest telling your team not to Surrender. Maybe to keep their head high and focus on the W, but, if they want to Surrender, it's not really ideal to try and actively dissuade them from it.\n2) From what I've seen, there has been one person who climbed to Honor 2 from Honor 1 in around 2-3 months? But it could certainly be faster depending on your behavior.\n3) Your Honor progression is not affected by the outcome of the match. Win or lose, you'll progress the same degree.\n4) My advice is as follows;\n\n- Whenever you get aggravated, breathe. Four seconds in, seven seconds out. Breathe, and focus.\n- Have some short, simple venting method on-hand - yell out loud, punch a pillow, squeeze a stress ball, etc.\n- Take breaks often. I only really play 2-3 games a day so as to avoid burning out and letting my anger get to me.\n- Always Honor someone after the game - Team Honor Bonus matters.\n- Make the effort to be Honorable - whether subtly through gameplay (playing initiators/vanguard tanks/catchers), or normally through chat. Give the \"GL/HF\", \"GG\", and give teammates a \"GJ\" if they score a kill or objective.","replies":[]}]}
