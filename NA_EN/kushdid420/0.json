I'm sure you've heard about Zac and his limitations due to the stretching when he moves around. I'm sure there are others, but that's the one that popped into my head 'cause it was a headache brainstorming ideas for the poor dude. At least Pool Party came out pretty solid.\n\nAny older champion who hasn't had an update has rig limitations in terms of how we can make the character move. Sure, we can give them a new model, but if it's on an existing rig (which is what we do for lower tier skins), we may not be able to do x, y, and z. We can make minor adjustments if the new model calls for it (different hair, for example), but it's not a completely new rig. \n\n> That all aside, what Swain players are expecting is a legendary skin given that Dragon Master Swain has been promised by Rioters for all these years now. \"Not a question of if but of when\".

With champions who are harder to work with, there could be concepts that just didn't work out, which means artists need to go back to the drawing board and find something else that works.
