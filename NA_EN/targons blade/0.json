{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-11T01:46:25.244+0000","title":"Known bugs in macOS 10.12 Sierra","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, everyone!\n\nApple recently launched macOS 10.12 Sierra and have just begun pushing it out to anyone who's enabled *automatic updates*. You can find the list of Macs that are getting this update **[here](http://www.apple.com/macos/how-to-upgrade/)**.\n\nKeep in mind that new OS's are known to experience bugs with the client until our devs have had a chance to track them down and work them out. Below is a current list of bugs we're aware of and looking to fix:\n\n**1) Editing Item Sets:** The client doesn't interact well with clicking+dragging content inside the client, therefore it's not possible to edit or create Item Sets at the moment. The workaround for this is to edit or create item sets on another computer *not running* macOS 10.12 Sierra.\n\n**2) Editing Rune Pages:** Similarly to the issue above, you cannot click+drag runes onto a rune page at the moment. The workaround for this is to simply *double-click* on the rune to add it to the rune page.\n\n___\n\nIf you've experienced any bugs while playing League on macOS 10.12 Sierra that aren't listed here, write a reply! We'll be passing any trending bugs to our devs for further investigation.","replies":[{"poster":"Anski","date":"2016-10-14T19:06:23.243+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have noticed that macs have lower FPS since the recent patch, regardless of graphic settings in the game.

The problem is that I have to reinstall league of legends after I testet every Patch the beta client again, because the League Icon starts automated the Beta Client and so I have to start 3 Clients before I can join the Champ select and that is ugly too.

I thought it was just my imagination or me making excuses, but your testimony convinced me this is an issue with Sierra or OSX in general. I have had to spend months destroying my mouse habits in order to play this game. It has this awful jitter that is especially bad when moving the camera in teamfights. Kiting? Forget about it. I am a one trick pony with like 500 games this season on my champ, so I know my mouse movements. But all of a sudden I find it difficult to do jungle camps without canceling autos because the mouse is so erratic. Between this and the screen tearing/fps lag in teamfights, im playing at more of a disadvantage than usual to the point where the only solution is to stop playing. \n\nIf this is anything like that bug that rekt OS X users back in patch 6.something, the only real solution is to quit the game for a few months until Riot decides to investigate, or it just magically fixes itself one patch. I think the only fix is to downgrade from sierra. I know Riot has no reason to cater to such a small percentage of their playerbase, but man does it suck when every season there is just a 2 month window that the game is broken for Mac users and we just sit in silence hoping for a fix.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"The NA Deft","date":"2017-01-07T21:38:22.752+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you know if they've fixed the problem yet?
