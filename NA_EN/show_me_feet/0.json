Long hitboxes look like they connect or miss at their apex range because of the angle of the camera and the lay of the land, especially around the river and bases. Since the game is played in a 2-D plane with vertical cosmetic differences, the indicator and vfx won't match where the linear hitbox is. \n\nIt would require a complete rework of all collision and vfx matching, along with changing aiming recitals to match the pitch of the battlefield.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-05-13T23:07:43.143+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They are fine?","replies":[]}]}
