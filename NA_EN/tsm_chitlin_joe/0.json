When In game, everything was really small so I changed the resolution and got a bug splat. Every time I restarted the client, reinstalled the client, repaired the client, it crashes. Is there anyway to change the resolution back to normal without being in game? Or at least change the resolution back to default?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-06T00:01:06.628+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What likely happened is whatever resolution it was set to is a resolution either League or the Monitor simply won't operate with. We can reset the files that store this info that should resolve this issue. Please follow the steps below carefully:\n\n>First thing you wanna do is **log into League** then hop into your config folder, which should be in your installation directory:\n\n>**C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config**\n\n> *Delete* these two files:\n>**- input.ini**\n>**- PersistedSettings.json**\n\nOnce you've deleted these two files, hop into a custom match to confirm everything has been reset to default and that you can load into game. Let me know if this worked!","replies":[]}]}
