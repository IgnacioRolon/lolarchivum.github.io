Ge&#039;s free this week. At the end it said that I got S rank then &quot;Congrats you got a hextech chest&quot; (or something similar in orange letters).\r\n\r\nI check but got no chest in Loot. Check the profile page, had 2 available chest icon before the game, still have 2.\r\nI check Thresh on champion page. The box icon is not light up. My &quot;Season Highest Grade&quot; is still N/A but the &quot;Champion Points&quot; that count towards getting mastery crest is given (from 0 to 1547)\r\n\r\nIs this a bug or am I supposed to be punished for not owning the champion?\r\n\r\nIf this is intended then the system is very flawed. Hextech is supposed to help everybody including new players who don&#039;t own many champions. By limiting that they&#039;re only rewarded for playing champion they own, and only getting the reward once per champion, blocks them out of the hextech content after the 1st month or 2.","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-04-09T18:37:00.098+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can't earn chests for champions you don't own.
