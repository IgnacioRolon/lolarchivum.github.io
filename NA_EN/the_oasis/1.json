It's pretty easy to be down 20 kills in 10 minutes of ARAM if you get unlucky.  \n\nA 10 minute surrender in SR, however, would encourage poor play IMO.  People who perceive a mismatch after picks would then reason, \"it's only 10 minutes before I can bail out from what is sure to be a train wreck.\"  The same person, given 20 minutes, might not have a reason to issue a surrender.  They have no choice but to try for 20 minutes, which should yield better competitiveness than a 10 minute obligation.

You're assuming that the majority of the league community values \"competition\" higher than \"fun\" when playing.  4v5s are very Anti-fun by nature.\n\nIt's wrong to assume a 4v5 is anti-fun by nature.  Like I said, that's a pessimist's view, akin to a player who surrenders at 20 on the spot because they don't feel like they can win.  I've regularly won 4v5s in ARAM and in SR.  I've won 2v3s in Twisted Treeline.  Are the odds against you?  Sure.  For true competitors--especially if you have a reset Champion as a crutch--it's not a big deal.  In ARAM, especially, you get less division of experience points between champions, which makes for a stronger push by the leaver team.  Sometimes in ARAM, a 5v5 is harder to win than a 4v5.\n\nYour poll is kind of silly because who wouldn't vote to have fun?  The problem is people define fun in different ways, haha.  Anyhow, there is no real correlation between your poll and, for example, ranked SR, in which people, by the majority, wait to surrender.  There are quite a few reasons and not all of them have to do with being competitive.  Some people don't want to surrender because they want the game to play longer just so they can earn more IP.  Some people want to tryhard.  Etc. etc.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=FriendOfFerghus,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=KVAJLefQ,comment-id=0010000000000000,timestamp=2015-01-05T09:55:50.326+0000)\n> \n> There's a reason these threads have been popping up since season 1 - It's because people hate being stuck in a nigh-unwinnable game just because some poor sap's girlfriend cut his ethernet cable.\n\nLOL I'm sure that 99% of the people who play League are just having issues with their service provider and/or they have a crappy WiFi card.  Either way, if this \"issue\" has been coming up for five years, and RIOT still hasn't \"addressed\" it, good luck.  Seems like you are not in the majority in this case, not the minority, either.  It is what it is, assuming the servers aren't being hacked at that time lol.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
