Right now it looks very awkward and fills part of the screen.\nIt's been a few years by now, I know the client was in beta before, but will the client ever be resizable or is Riot not doing anything with \nthis?  Has anyone heard what's new with this?\n\nIf nothing is planned to be done with this, I think it'll be easier for me honestly to accept the icky looking size if I know not to hope for anything, and know not to use the game on computers where the size is too annoying....","replies":[{"poster":"Riot a huevo","date":"2019-04-29T22:27:13.007+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Abandon all hope. No full screen :(\n\nThe client has a bunch of design decisions that have been made around its current aspect ratio. So, to allow for random aspect ratios we would have to do a QA pass on all those features. Verify that the positioning of many UI elements are correct for a bunch of different screen sizes with varying resolutions. Nothing is impossible, but the effort that it would take is better spent on other areas, like performance and newer, better features.\n\nYou can resize the client, but the aspect ratio remains the same.
