The game has stopped opening.  I click the icon, it bounces once, and never opens.  I am trying to reinstall and even downloaded the hex tech repair tool.  It did nothing to help.  I tried uninstalling but it won't let me, according to the instructions given to me by the Mac tool bar.  Help me quick!!!!
