I suspect this issue may be a result of your client not being able to reach the game platform servers. Since local network settings are the most common culprit for these issues, I recommend working through the steps in our [connection troubleshooting guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) as a next step.\n\nLet me know if those steps caused any change.","replies":[]}]}
