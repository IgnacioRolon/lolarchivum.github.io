Then I look at my in game MS and it's usually over 5000.

High spikes and changes in latency (ms) are often caused by poor routing to that specific server. Sometimes a number of local network settings can also affect your latency, so I recommend working through our basic [connection troubleshooting guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) as a first step in resolving this.\n\nLet me know if the steps in that guide caused any change.","replies":[]}]}
