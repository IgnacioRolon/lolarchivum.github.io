We vary in elo (Diamond mid, top plat and adc gold) but we want to learn and practice with each other. If anyone is interested in playing sup or jungle hmu! We would like to have people as soon as possible so we can practice (looking to play together 2ish times a week) And playing in tourny either every week or every other. \r\n\r\nFor Support: We would like someone who plays varying champs. Some champs that sustain (IE type Nami) and some hard engage (IE Leona type). Looking for gold+\r\nFor jungle: Again someone who has varying champions. Some tanks and some carries. Pref plat+ \r\n\r\nAgain let me know if you are interested! \r\nThanks,\r\nCP3 K9","replies":[{"poster":"Bràd","date":"2018-11-25T16:47:52.756+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im a solid jungle in mid gold, good winrate and great mechanics.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Blush uwu","date":"2018-11-25T07:27:45.350+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm a plat 4 jungle player that can play different styles of jungler I added you in game my ign is Blüsh","replies":[]},{"poster":"KaiserWilhelm II","date":"2018-11-25T03:16:12.594+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am G3 Supp in solo and Plat 5 in flex. play many diff champs i.e thresh naut ali morgana brand sona etc.","replies":[]}]}
