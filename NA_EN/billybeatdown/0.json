I'm sad to see what this game is becoming.\nEventually, you won't need a brain to play, as long as you have good reflexes/accuracy. \n\nI guess everyone know someone who's pretty good with Zed/Yasuo/LB/(Pick your swaggy champ) and : \n\n- insta-lock top/mid/jgl.\n- Always choose the same build, because \"item are not supposed to counter, they're just abilities and stats\".\n- Don't even care about what anyone in any team is building.\n- Q.Q when he can't trade someone in 1v1.

Really?)  but there is no denying the fact that the Euro and the US Dollar have an exchange rate that is constantly in flux.
