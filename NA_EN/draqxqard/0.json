His kit was wonky, didnt really make any sense thematically, and he was just overall bad. I mean, i understand that some people found something special with him. They liked his wonky ass kit, and they made it work.\n\nI myself have found a great love for Poppy. She is similar to Sion in the sense that her kit doesnt represent what she was ment to be thematically. Right now, hyper-carry assassin seems to be the best Poppy, due to her insane damage and safety lategame. yet, that isnt what she is supposed to be. I realize that her kit is toxic, unfun to those fighting her, and doesn't thematically fit, and as much as I love it, I have to accept that it cant remain the way it is. \n\nThe kit being toxic was also a problem with old Sion. That fuck would stun you (Cant dodge), walk up, and 1-shot you with this wonky ass shield thing that would explode regardless of if you destroyed it or not. I'm sure it was fun as hell for the player, as it is really amusing for me to ult the supp in a teamfight and become 100% invincible 6 seconds with Poppy.  I will embrace the  new Poppy rework, and I can only hope she becomes what she needs to be. If it turns out she doesnt fit my playstyle, alas, cruel fate, she will be missed. \n\nIt is likely that others will find love for her new and improved state however, and she will be more ha[[ily recieved in games. once again, that is another big point. Not many people enjoyed old Sion and Current Poppy. Most just didnt find them fun to play. I think the Sona rework also borrows from this. Now, it might just be me, but Sion is hella fun right now. Run in, pray you land that ulti, and make sure no one in a 300 Radius is moving without impairment. Sona feels more rewarding, and I am currently enjoying her new kit. Hopefully I will feel the same about new Poppy.\n\nI don't know much about the Skarner and Karma fiasco, so I cant comment on that. I do expect that it was either a case of what I have previously mentioned, or Riot just legitimately messed up (Ex: Cassiopeia).","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Kira Onime","date":"2014-11-28T02:58:39.984+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You could probably delete around half the champion pool and only a minority of people would complain about it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cale017","date":"2014-11-28T01:35:18.228+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Because he's a champion that fills a niche role, just like any other.
