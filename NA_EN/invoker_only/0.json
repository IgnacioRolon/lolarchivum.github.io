Not in low elo.\n\nJuggernaut maybe, but tank no. \n\nI say no, because you are the main engage, and you have to rely the most of anyone completely on your team. If you go in any anyone doesn't go in, you are dead. By late game, if your team doesn't scale well, you are essentially just a meat bag with this lethality meta. \n\nIF you are taking a tank because you feel your team needs one, that is one thing, but you aren't going to \"Carry\" as a tank in low elo.","replies":[]},{"poster":"bbQsau√ße","date":"2017-02-18T11:46:59.352+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Aptest","date":"2017-02-18T12:04:48.273+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"to a major extent I agree.\n\nA big problem of all tanks is that they are very committed to doing one thing and one thing alone. If you have a team of donkeys than you have to be very flexible and do a bunch of stuff all at once which tanks are not good at. \n\nWhereas divers / skirmishers / support casters / mages and sometimes even assassins can certainly do. \n\nSo as a general case, unless you know exactly why you're picking any specific particular tank, go for a character that is more mobile and at least partially damage oriented.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"LordGeovanni","date":"2017-02-18T19:03:15.729+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if you can trust any one to follow up on your engage. as some one who picks tanks and fighters i often have to engage and to 70% of 3 peoples hp to get any one to engage with me  that is to say no one follows up so i end up dieing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"EndlessSorcerer","date":"2017-02-18T15:44:55.741+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tanks are always valuable in low ELO because many people just play squishy, low-utility carries.  However, they probably aren't the best option if you with to climb quickly with uncoordinated teams (and many of them aren't particularly good at the moment).\n\nIf you do decide to play tanks, the following are viable options:\n{{champion:111}} {{champion:57}} {{champion:78}} {{champion:14}} {{champion:154}}\n-----------------\n\nWhile I haven't been in Silver since S5, I had great success with Siege Casters such as Varus (ADC) and Ziggs (Mid).  They provided safe waveclear (to prevent enemy pushes), poke (to defend objectives and harass before fights) and CC (to engage, disengage or pick off targets).\n\nI'd probably recommend trying champions such as:\n{{champion:202}} {{champion:110}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:101}} {{champion:115}} \n-------------------\nAlternatively, I had found success with objective-oriented splitpushers (i.e. Nasus).  While your team often doesn't know how to play with a splitpusher, the enemy team won't know how to properly handle you and will misappropriate resources. \n\nIf you want to try this route, I would highly recommend playing {{champion:83}} top-lane.  He is a strong splitpusher (capable of dueling many champions, good escapes), kills towers quickly and can single-handedly solo neutral objectives (i.e. Rift Herald, Dragon).  While soloing Baron can be risky, you will generally only need one other ally with you to kill it.","replies":[{"poster":"Incarceration","date":"2017-02-18T15:49:59.574+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Absolutely true.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BALDG1VEN BOOMER","date":"2017-02-18T15:45:23.282+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I played alistar for the most part when I was in silver, cc heavy tanks like Ali, Leo, Vi, Zac etc all can do a good job of engaging and peeling","replies":[]},{"poster":"FrodoBagginses","date":"2017-02-18T15:33:23.210+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, as if they can't fight back than not mater how bad your team is they will eventually die.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LaughingStapler","date":"2017-02-18T12:41:49.982+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not for a smurf but if you are low ELO in reality, it works well.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GULAG 4 U","date":"2017-02-18T12:02:48.847+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No melee carries are.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Aptest","date":"2017-02-18T12:00:31.068+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the biggest need for low elo teams is to start fights.
