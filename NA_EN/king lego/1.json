Urgot doesn't have much aoe damage except his passive which is close ranged like a shotgun.\n\nHowever, you can cast W on Urgot and recast W again, you won't be in that machine gun stance while in W but the shield remains for a few duration, and Urgot can use the shield bash aa proc, and add that with his shotgun it should hurt quite hard. I tried Trinity Force on Urgot. It's decent especially with his shotgun passive.\n\nI'm still working on Trinity Force Urgot.
