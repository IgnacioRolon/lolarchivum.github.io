I want to know how to get better mentally and not flame and tilt as much. I'm terrible afraid of getting banned recently even though I probably deserve it but I just want y'all to help me become a nicer person and better player mentally.","replies":[{"poster":"Cheini","date":"2019-02-22T23:08:54.808+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"k two things:\n\nfirst, it is a bit bad on rito's side allowing players to requeue right away after a loss / a game full of flamers, yet you can take care of that.. if you go in a new game right away, you will flame - declarative sentence!\n\nnext, just remember.. sometimes it happens to screw up on a thing, soo just don't mind it and next time it will be k :p others would flame if a player fails and stuff but.. do you want to do it as well? i mean, it was merely a mistake, everyone makes these.. including your lane opponent right?\n\nofc, if one is trolling on purpose, go ahead and share your thoughts. But don't go too far.. be fair with him - if he just has a day off, try to cheer him or just make him feel a bit better.. instead of fanning the fire for good..\n\nfor the people who try their best to flame though.. you know, i have a friend that noted quite properly: \"Oh people are so lame... sometimes, i just keep quiet and laugh at them how stupid they are xdd\" ..she is one of the people that are, honestly, normal. and, iis absolutely right, isn't she? :p\n\n&nbsp;\njust do your best to be the one who you want to be.. and that is it all, really!

Four seconds in, seven seconds out, repeat a few times as necessary. In particularly stressful situations, some well-paced breaths can provide enough catharsis to clear your head and get you back into playing form.\n\n2) This is gonna be some generic advice, but _have something on hand to vent with_ - squeeze a stress ball, punch a pillow, fuck around with a fidget spinner, or even shout obscenities at your monitor. Anything outside of the game to give you a release valve when stuff inside the game is working you up.\n\n3) _Take breaks often_. Like the anger that is a byproduct of such, playtime is something that has to be managed. It's easy to let yourself get caught up in a positive feedback loop of losing, tilting, queuing up, losing, tilting, etc., so even if you don't want to end your play session on a loss, I'd wholeheartedly advise to take a break at the first sign of tilt. Personally, I take breaks roughly every 1-3 games.\n\n**Specific:**\n\nThis advice is going to tread more along the lines of \"what works for some, not for others\", so take it with a grain of salt. My methods of stress relief have their merits, but they're far from say-all, end-all, be-all solutions.\n\n4) _Redirect your anger to something constructive_. Anger, as I have learned, is seldom something that can be easily dissipated, much less recovered from, so I've found that one of the best ways of dealing with anger is to change its course. Rather than getting bent out of shape at my teammates for underperforming, I'll focus on setting an example and giving the enemy team hell. No sense in wasting good rage, y'know?\n\n5) _Have a friend/sibling/anyone to vent to_. In a similar vein to No. 2, having a vent partner, just anyone who you can rant and rave at while the game is going on, can make a hell of a difference. It's one thing to diffuse your anger by shouting \"fuck, goddammit, sunovabitch\" at every grey screen, but there's much more catharsis to be found in being heard and having someone to understand why you're shouting.\n\n6) And, lastly, if you're going to say something, _think it, re-think it, and think again._ If you really, absolutely must say something, make sure you say it in the best way you can. Rewriting or rethinking what you're going to say may take time, but being tactful can save you a lot of flak, and who knows? In the time it takes to figure out the best way to say it, you may find out that there's no reason to say it at all.\n\nHopefully some of these - hell, even one of these tidbits - help you to develop a better mentality, or at the least develop the skills to turn a harmful mentality into something productive. If you've any questions, feel free to ask.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Galaxyburstz","date":"2019-02-16T22:16:04.139+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Deg7VrpHbM","replies":[]}]}
