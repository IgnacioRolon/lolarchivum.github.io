Did you know there has been a small exodus from league lately with many youtubers posting videos discussing why they don&#039;t think league is fun anymore?  How long do you expect people to play the current game before they burn out?  Do you really think it has that much draw?  To certain people like myself it does, but even then there is a limit.  How long do you think league will remain successful as it currently is?  What are you planning to keep people interested and keep the game fresh?\r\n\r\nWhy do you remove features?  Like the Bilgewater themed Aram map?  Why don&#039;t you have a custom game mode section where people can pick which games they want to play without having to wait for the weekend?  Why don&#039;t you reskin the Summoners Rift map in normals but leave ranked games only one map since it is competitive?  \r\n\r\nDo you know it annoys people when you say you don&#039;t have enough resources even though you fund LCS and back other changes to the game?  \r\n\r\nI love LCS, I love the current game.  I actually do like most of the changes you guys make.  I have been playing the game for almost 4 years and I have sunk a ton of money into skins.  I do this because I want to support RIOT and want to see their game become massively successful.  But it doesn&#039;t seem you guys are being 100% honest with us.\r\n\r\nAre you trying to keep the game under a certain size?  Why is it difficult to support map skins?  What is your reasoning?  What is more important, the competitive scene or the over all fun of the average player?  \r\n\r\nLeague of Legends is an amazing game and I&#039;m not presuming to tell you guys where you need to allocate resource since I don&#039;t have the full picture.  But from the outside, it seems you guys make some interesting choices without really talking to the community.  We want more in depth answers as why you guys are making certain decisions.  As it is, a lot of people feel very frustrated and tired of League and are opting out.  This is something I absolutely hate to see.  So please RIOT, look into it, answer our questions, talk to us.  \r\n\r\nPeople who read this, thanks for giving it your time.  Please post below questions you have for RIOT.","replies":[{"poster":"DingleNutsMcGee","date":"2016-07-04T19:36:54.128+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with your post but not your opinion. I for one do not agree with most of riots decisions over the past couple years. They add/remove things with no regards for the communitys opinion. They claim not to have the resources for the same things that other mobas do offer. Dynamic queue is an absolute atrocity to ranked. Its been nothing but an epic fail, and no matter what they do to it, it will NEVER be good. Its just inherently a bad system. I could go on for days about how they are slowly, but surely, ruining the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Azure Hamster","date":"2016-07-04T18:16:42.892+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Map skins? o_0\n\nSeems really hard to playbalance. Like if you and I have different ground colors, different abilities will stand out or not in different ways on that background.\n\nAs a game designer, I wouldn't allow map skins. Character skins are dangerous enough as it is.\n\n{{champion:51}}","replies":[{"poster":"BlakDynomite","date":"2016-07-04T18:19:38.049+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was only thinking in normal games.

Every change has to be checked for possible bugs with every available game mode. Having too many modes available at once could bog down development. Modes like Nemesis Draft, Hexakill, or Poro King might not be too difficult to maintain, but others like URF or One for All probably have a bunch of oddities to work around.","replies":[]},{"poster":"zorlox77","date":"2016-07-04T18:47:42.371+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think that riot will answer this when they see this. There are simply too many unrelated question all in one post. I agree with most of your concerns and opinions, but dropping them all in one discussion is a good way to get all of them ignored. If you want to you can ask riot directly @ https://ask.leagueoflegends.com/hc/en-us/requests/new or clicking [this](https://ask.leagueoflegends.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) link. By asking them directly you have a better chance of getting a response.","replies":[]}]}
