My account is a release Account, with like 2k spent on it overall, maybe a little more, maybe a little less. I'm beyond scared of having this account perma'd. I know that the stuff i've typed was more than enough to get me banned, after reading the rules (the first time in 10 years mind you). I'm not looking for my \"sentence\" to be cut short, but to make DAMN sure that this account has a clean slate from now on, so clean i could eat off it. Here is what i thought i might do, and i want y'all to give me input in what y'all think should be done. From now on my only way of communication will be (GG, GJ :), Go Drag, Secure baron vision, me split bot) and so on. In conjunction with me /muteall at the beginning of the game, regardless of flamers or not. I won't type anything else, I've never \"ran it down\" or fed in general so that won't be an issue. Is this enough to make SURE i won't get banned? Is not talking except bare necessities a SUREFIRE way to not get banned? \n\nHere are my logs so you can take them apart.\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1EXFvlZAw-Zzlth9ogZbdq5Kwy7YSTrjfSU-jyn-DIyU/edit\n\nThanks for reading.","replies":[{"poster":"LeafieGreens2","date":"2019-03-14T11:56:35.242+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been where you are. 14 day suspension, went from honor 5 to honor locked hell.  \n\nI know I used to get crazy angry and frustrated and felt like \"why me? why do I always get the flamers and morons and blah blah blah...\"\n\nThen I started watching pros on Twitch and Youtube and the common thing about all of them is that they are so calm and chill.

Then I had to get it from Honor 0 to Honor 1 then to Honor 2 where I am currently at (checkpoint 2).  \n\nI know that you can put in a support ticket with Riot to check and they can look at your honor numbers and give you an idea about where you are. \n\nAs far as punishment tiers, I have no clue how they decay from the account.  There are others here on the boards who know this stuff better than I do, so you could try to post a separate thread asking about how this works.  \n\nI know it took about eight months to get back to honor 2. I know that if you play quicker games like ARAM or even the Summoner's Rift vs the bots they also count toward your honor grind and if you play a couple here and there each day it will speed things up for you. When you get honored, it helps you move quicker. But even games where you don't get honored it still helps you. It's definitely a grind.  Which is why it is so important that you change.  \n\nPeace man.

It is completely okay to mute chat entirely if you think that's what it will take to keep out of trouble.\n\nBut have you thought of training yourself to respond to various aggrivating situations differently to avoid tilting and saying something you'll regret?\n\nFor example, say someone on your team is not being rude or anything, but they're performing pretty poorly. Does this always upset/annoy you? If you can, resist the urge to say something like \"you're bad, uninstall\" or other negative things. If you have to say something, just say \"Try this [stuff], it might help you avoid difficult situations.\" If you are able to frame things constructively, the response you get will be better and less frustrating for both you and them, and then their performance might also actually improve. \n\nBasically, berating your team mates for making a bad play etc. is never going to have a positive effect. It will just tilt both them and you and will probably make both you and them perform worse.","replies":[{"poster":"BlooYed","date":"2019-03-14T10:01:43.593+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"See, that's what i have an issue with after reading (countless) posts on this forum.

If you come across as condescending or sarcastic, you're going to get ignored.

Positive chat use is encouraged, since it will help you recover your honor faster. But again; don't write even one line that someone might take negatively - just to be safe.\n\nI hope you recover your honor and recover from your current 14-day suspension status back to chat penalty punishment ladder and from there back to no-punishment layer. However, even if you do recover, never means never.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-03-14T12:09:22.451+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Was this your first punishment?","replies":[{"poster":"BlooYed","date":"2019-03-14T12:29:31.022+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=KFCeytron,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=oH7KbiHz,comment-id=000a,timestamp=2019-03-14T12:09:22.451+0000)\n>\n> Was this your first punishment?\n\nNo, i got 10 Chat-Rest, 25 Chat-Rest and now this.","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-03-14T12:56:00.651+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=BlooYed,realm=EUW,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=oH7KbiHz,comment-id=000a0000,timestamp=2019-03-14T12:29:31.022+0000)\n>\n> No, i got 10 Chat-Rest, 25 Chat-Rest and now this.\n\nYou would ideally have gotten \"scared as hell\" after your first punishment rather than the third, but fortunately it's not permanent yet. Look over the logs in your reform cards, spend some time here in PB to see what other players get punished for, and stay far away from that behavior from now on. The slightest bit of negativity could prompt a permaban now. No trash talk, no \"banter,\" no passive-aggressive arguments, nothing. No need to respond at all to any negative situation. Someone inting? They're not gonna stop just because you ask. Someone telling you off for dying? Don't start giving excuses or complaining that they didn't ward or whatever. Don't even try to say something positive in negative situations, as that could be seen as sarcasm/trolling.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"6 Years Unranked","date":"2019-03-13T20:04:46.355+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":11,"body":"Non-perma punishments get reset every season\n\nJust play on a smurf until season 10, just in case\n\nThen, in season 10, just don't type","replies":[{"poster":"BlooYed","date":"2019-03-13T20:07:08.900+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not sure it work's that way from what i've read.
