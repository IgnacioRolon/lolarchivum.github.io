I remember having something like a 3.5k heal on his W when full AP while still having the damage reduction which allowed you to dive in, hit hard as hell, then meditate till alpha was off CD then alpha again lol. Oh how i miss AP yi","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DonnieDarkin","date":"2017-03-21T16:31:20.644+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not only that, the magic damage was great poke in lane even if you weren't going AP.
