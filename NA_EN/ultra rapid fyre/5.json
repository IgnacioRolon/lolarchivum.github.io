AKA each ability should give 25%.\r\n\r\nWhy you ask? its the only reasonable way to make his passive proccable, but it also allows him to proc the attack speed boost more often, which would make him healthier without being overpowered what so ever","replies":[{"poster":"DonnieDarkin","date":"2017-03-21T16:34:58.851+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes. I see many players suggesting this. I think its very reasonable. If only Riot every paid attention to us.","replies":[]}]}
