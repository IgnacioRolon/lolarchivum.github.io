She doesn't have enough traps for it. She can protect her flanks or use it to block a lane for anti engage or save them for chain CC.\n\nThat's a difference. If she is blocking your tower with the traps, she is vulnerable to get flanked and killed by your jungler.\n\nEvery zoning tool can be used for the exact same tasks. That's why they are zoning tools.
