Im not understanding why an item with AD, and lethality, and MR all at decent numbers needing a built in activatable banshees that you can choose when to use.\r\n\r\nNever should an item have the capability of completely negating 100% of an initiation while being an OFFENSSIVE item\r\n\r\nIt makes things like malphite ults diving the back line utterly useless.\r\n\r\nBanshees is atleast fair because its made to be a defenssive item.\r\n\r\nIts the same thing with like {{item:3147}}  having the ability to show wards and traps... like WHY? There are trinkets, and vision wards ( ok ok theyre control wards ) for such purposes\r\n\r\nYou designed the item to be for assassins being able to get in, and have a few seconds of freedom to get out with the use of Edge of night, but the reality is its a terribly designed item because it gives such free engages to alot of champions who dont need it, thus propelling them to a much higher level of being stronger for absolutely no reason.\r\n\r\nIts not the same as an offenssive item like {{item:3139}}  which has defenssive capability, but the defenssive aspect doesnt negate any damage on the active ( you still get hit, you still get CCed, but it allows for real counterplay options )\r\n\r\nEdge of night simply deletes the initiating spells of an enemy which primarily effects mages, but also effects many other champions for example Varus using his ult to initiate... or amumu using his ult to lock a team in place ( provided they see the incoming engage )\r\n\r\nIts too much to need to pop all these shields with low CDs burning precious spells needed for combos all because you release one extremely over powered item with too much front loaded power\r\n\r\nDo you guys even play the game you design? really though","replies":[{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-02-24T01:04:01.298+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">The real issue with this item is that it gives FREE engages to assaassins\n\nThe item was specifically designed for that. That is the whole purpose of the item in the first place\n\n>as well as a preloaded get out of jail free card for any ADC in the back line using it who gets hard dove\n\nIt takes 1.5 seconds to channel, and it will only last for 5 seconds. It can't be used reactively at all, and the window of prediction is now significantly smaller.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lauchmelder","date":"2017-02-24T00:44:21.310+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Never should an item have the capability of completely negating 100% of an initiation while being an OFFENSSIVE item\n\n\nLet it be heard!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Edge of Daybreak","date":"2017-02-24T00:43:59.250+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Malph ult is instant. In no situation are you going to use edge of night to react to it. \n\nAlso edge isnt a free initiation and escape in a teamfight should the support do their job. You have exhaust and at least 2 cc to worry about assuming a random spell doesnt lightly grave you. Edge blocks one thing. ONE. not multiple. Even lulu can press 2 buttons to cc you assuming she doesnt glitter lance you first. \n\nAlso they are nerfing it holy shit we dont need 20 threads complaining about it after riot already stated it's getting hotfixed.","replies":[]}]}
