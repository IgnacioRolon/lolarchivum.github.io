But i do care about my account.\r\n\r\nThe account that i use to write this message is my smurf, and not the one that got hacked.\r\n\r\n3 day ago a friend told me that he saw me play a lot since almost 2 month ( i'm not sure about how much time ). ANd i know it's not me.\r\n\r\nSo i try to connect to my account, password changed, and i try to get my password back by email, the email told me that only this account that i use to write this message is linked to my email. So email associated to my main account got changed too.\r\n\r\nI went to riot support and answered all of their quesions ,as proof that i was the owner of the account, but still no answer since 3 day. I've been hacked since more than a month, so i guess a few day more won't change all, but i was wondering if that's supposed to take that long ?\r\n\r\nThe whole story don't make much sense to me, i understand that people want to hack account. But playing so much on my account everyday, without deleting my friendlist is just absurd. If he would have delete my friendlist, i would probably not have noticed that i've been hacked. He actually insulted hard my friend who went to talk to 'me'. Wich is just the best to do to get spotted. \r\n\r\nI'm a bit worried about that too, i guess my honor will go down as this guy probably flame a lot in game, i just hope i won't get banned.  Having my ranked stat ruined and a season with a bad ranking because of him doing ranked on my acc is already a pain. But i can't really blame riot for it, even if it's not my fault either.","replies":[{"poster":"Keristrasz","date":"2017-11-02T05:43:03.325+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for your answer.\n\nI'm not sure about my ticket number. Support said that i shouldn't be logged to make this kind of request, so i did all the request, and after completing it, i was waiting for a mail, i didnd't saw any ticket number. I guess i messed up, i will probably do it again. That's maybe why i had no answer so far !\n\n\nOk, so i just did the whole thing again, and after completing the request, i just send me back to the main support page, without giving me any ticket. So what do i do ? I wait for an email ?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-11-01T16:54:19.073+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't worry, our account team can help you update your info and regain your access.
