I don't want you getting more and longer LPQ's if you're just trying to figure out what's wrong. \n\nThese kinds of problems mainly happen when you network is just having some problems getting a stable connection. You had a strong enough connection to get matched with a game, but with all the data flying around once the game starts it must be too much to handle. I'd suggest first updating your port forward and DNS settings since those can make your connection be routed in a better way. If you aren't sure how to do that on your own, check out those steps in the [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues).","replies":[{"poster":"Antisereld0","date":"2017-11-10T14:14:45.139+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Too late closed the whole game . couldnt sign in for a whole hour\ndownloaded something from u guys a hex tool it fixed it and when i came back it said leaverbuster for 5 games ugh everything is so frustrating without good gear.\n[](http://ust.chatango.com/um/a/n/antisereldo/img/l_372.jpg)","replies":[]}]}]}]}
