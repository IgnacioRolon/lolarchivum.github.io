I&#039;d say I&#039;m decent all things considered at all 3, but when I have to lane against a {{champion:86}} or {{champion:13}} (though with Ryze it's more me getting frustrated by his snares), and even worse is when a {{champion:11}} or {{champion:157}} help them out on top, I die pretty much every single time. I just don&#039;t know WTF I&#039;m supposed to do half the time against a Garen, since he seems to be able to spam out his abilities every 3 seconds and do ridiculous amounts of damage, even in early game, and I can&#039;t even escape from the guy.\n\nThough I haven&#039;t encountered much of him, {{champion:122}} also gave me a LOT of trouble when I laned against him some games ago. I was always just left amazed at how much freakin&#039; damage he did to me in just one ability.\n\nSo yeah, any help or tips would be greatly appreciated!","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-12-22T03:44:48.759+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:122}} {{champion:86}} are more or less broken and unbeatable (but not really OP, for reasons i will get to).

Darius doesn't have the means to reach people unless he's popping flash E.  Darius can at least get resets in teamfights but that's hardly common.  Garen's a total lane bully.  Outside of lane he gets kited extremely hard.\n\nThe top 3 champions you picked - Gnar is a teamfighting monster.  Fiora can split push and 1 v 1 almost any champion late game.  Camille doesn't have the issues the other two have, she has massive engage range and can still target people and the ult is a great teamfighting tool for isolating targets.\n\nYou're not trying to win lane if you're laning against Garen/Darius, that's not what you want to do.  It's not the strength of the champs you picked.\nYou have to look at the matchup and say 'I'm a teamfighter laning against a lane bully.\"  This allows you to prioritize.  Farm up, play it safe, wait for jungle help, and wait until the time comes for you to utilize the strengths of the champions you picked.\n\nAlthough with that said you should be able to kite them out pretty hard with Gnar.","replies":[]}]}]}
