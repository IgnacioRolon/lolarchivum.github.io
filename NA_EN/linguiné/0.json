It never patched through and it completely broke down. And when I tried clicking the program. It would pop up this message everytime: \r\n> C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\LeagueClient.exe \r\n> The application has failed to start because its side-by-side configuration is incorrect. Please see the application event log or use the command-line sxstrace.exe tool for more detail.\r\n\r\nI tried many solutions when searching this up, such as redownloading my visual c++ or deleting all of League and reinstalling it again. But that same message keeps popping up. But now after many attempts. I can't even get the new client since it has to be given through the old client. But when I go into the League of Legends directory folder and tried through there. That same message keeps popping up. \r\n\r\n**_Please help_**","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-07-27T18:36:30.139+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This error message is unusual, but I'm betting a security setting is denying your game files from being accessed.
