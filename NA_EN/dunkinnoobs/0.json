Caitlin never even made an auto animation or launched a projectile.\n\nTypical wood-tier Yasuo play, personally i love it when people make those after counterpicking me with Yasuo. Yasuo and Riven players have an almost religious fervor turret-diving people at low HP and denial of the usual outcome of said action.

That sort of stuff has always worked (two attacks/abilities being used at exactly the same time).\n\nUnless i am mistaken, the auto was buffered and hit aatrox as soon as he was in range, but dark flight is not canceled by CC (very few dashes are), so it still knocks up xin.\n\nGoogle \"LoL buffering\" and you will probably find a hilarious video of lee and alistar R/Eing eachother at the same time, they both fly backwards an amusing distance.","replies":[{"poster":"DunkinNoobs","date":"2016-10-23T04:09:17.634+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dark Flight **IS** canceled by CC. That's one of the biggest drawbacks of the champion and part of why people think he's so bad. And you're partially right about buffering. Many abilities can be buffered so that they go through even if they get CC'ed during their cast time. Ezreal's ult is the most obvious example of this. This does not apply to auto attacks, however. Any hard CC will interrupt any auto attack and prevent it from doing damage. Anyone who's faced Riven on a regular basis knows this, and the best Rivens will save their W and 3Q to interrupt enemy autos. Point is, this shit wasn't happening with nearly this frequency since this patch, which is why I created the thread to begin with.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
