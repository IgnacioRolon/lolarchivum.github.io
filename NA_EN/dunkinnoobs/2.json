If we desperately need front line control out of top lane but pick GP instead, it&#039;s your fault if we end up losing even if you play really well. Having a reasonable win condition is exceedingly important and by picking champs that don&#039;t fill the teams needs, you often guarantee that your team has no win condition other than &quot;snowball so hard that comp doesn&#039;t matter&quot;. Let me tell you, that is not a reliable win condition. No matter how good you are at your champion, betting the match on your entire team snowballing out of control is an incredibly stupid move to make. \r\n\r\nThis doesn&#039;t just apply to top laners not picking tanks; it can also apply to mid laners not picking champs with adequate range and CC, junglers not picking champs with adequate early pressure potential, adcs not picking champs with adequate dps potential or adequate mobility, and supports picking champs that go against the rest of the teams flow. Picking Zed when your team needs AOE magic damage and CC will probably fuck you. Picking Warwick when the enemy Elise has multiple high kill pressure lanes to gank will probably fuck you. Picking Ezreal or Lucian when the enemy team has 3 tanks will probably fuck you. Picking Soraka when the rest of your team is playing high pressure playmaker champs will probably fuck you.","replies":[{"poster":"k wìx","date":"2017-01-10T15:34:16.838+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Disagree. \n\n1.)

That&#x27;s bullshit.\n\nHonestly, if you want to form a comp, you pretty much need to start before the first picks come out. (i.e. discuss it during the ban phase) And with pick intent, no one should really be blindsided by someones champion pool. (If you wait until last pick to find out your teammate isn't comfortable with tanks, the whole team done goofed) \n\nIt's also shows a lack of trust in the last pick. Though not everyone can fill ones expectations, their are many who can still contribute to the team comp. (e.x. I'm not to keen on tank supports, But I can easily play an enchanters with enough shields to be tanky, and provide poke/peel)","replies":[{"poster":"k wìx","date":"2017-01-10T15:56:42.116+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Then I think your argument should be a bit more about opening up communication during the starting moments because:\n\n1.)

I think HOTS does this.\n\nDon't know about HOTS, but I think mechanics like that wouldn't work too well, due to how much the meta shifts, and Riot doesn't particularly want to enforce or encourage a particular meta. The necessity of a tank, or the amount of CC you need for a comp, is completely relative to what that comp is trying to accomplish. (A Liss/Kennen can easily provide Team engage due to their kits, and not need to be tanky.) \n\nBut that's another reason why we need more communication, if everyone has different opinions on what the comp should look like, your actual composition is going to look like a mess. Also cause I don't think everyone has the same definition of Tank. Sometimes they actually mean a Vanguard with legitimate team engage, other times, they just want someone who doesn't die in 2 seconds.","replies":[{"poster":"k wìx","date":"2017-01-10T16:36:23.440+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just consider this part of the \"magic of solo queue.\" Or ranked in general - its fun to see who's shitty comp will win them the day.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Randomonium","date":"2017-01-10T15:45:57.671+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"This implies that everyone has a champion pool large enough that they can fit whatever role their team needs them to fill. I think that's an unrealistic expectation. If your top laner isn't comfortable playing tanks then why force him to play one? I can't tell you how many times someone has picked a champion because \"it synergized well\" only to get complete dominated in lane. Nevermind the whole auto fill issue. If one of my teammates gets auto filled I want them playing their best champion in that role because they're already at a huge disadvantage playing a role they don't play that often.\n\nI do agree with your over arching concepts that people need to communicate more in champion select and need to be more flexible in their picks. There's no reason not to pick a champ that synergized well with your team if you know how to play them. That said, it's unrealistic to expect every person to have at least 1 champion of every class or subclass that they can play in ranked.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wolf Queen","date":"2017-01-10T16:07:28.184+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You do realize this is solo queue?
