You need a champion who brings something that can catch him in that point. If he's running at you and his Q/Q needs to catch you on the getaway, then your prime objective is pulling your getaway into an extremely unfavorable position for him where he'll either not take it or land you a kill. If your champion is getting pressured by raw fact of Lee pressuring that champ, you need to consider a better pick.\n\nIf you're deep, you need vision coverage. If you're getting caught out alone, bring a friend and accompany that teammate closely. If he's punishing you for initiating on his team, try to CS and keep them from pushing your turret down. While he's busy pressuring your lane, make note for your team so your jungle can help or gank elsewhere, or else notify your team (as jungle) where you'll be applying the heat and advise the ganked lane to bait him by going on the defensive. It might not be an objective, but if you waste three minutes of his time while he has to pussyfoot around the turret and your support, or you're top lane and you can keep him busy enough for a gank to go off, that's as good as you're getting. It's not about making the showstopping play-- it's about winning the game, and not flubbing the lane for your team. It's not glorious play, but hugging the turret to buy some time sure beats getting your ass kicked in the middle of the lane with no cover because you had to be on the front. If Lee Sin consistently beats you, play around that outcome. You might not stop him dead and conquer him, but if you can delay the presumed inevitable then you're doing more favours over risk-taking and hoping you land a kill that actually applies pressure.\n\nJust because he's oppressive, doesn't mean you can't adapt your plays.
