The emblem at the bottom shows the old League of Legends logo.

It was just setted to that when I started. Ifeel most comfortable with that too. If i make the resolution to like 2150 it just doesnt work out with me. Cursors too slow and stuff. Maybe its cause im playing with laptop. 1280 800 setting works totally fine in window mode but always shifted in full screen mode. Other resolution seems like it doesnt have problem for me. Full screen and no prob.

I try to fix this by first moving the option screen that comes out when u press esc, so you can see it and changed the screen to window. If I change back to full screen, It's kinda fixed but pushed bit upward. So I can't see the top part like cs time kda and stuffs. It works totally fine for other resolutions, but I get this problem when I'm only in 1280 * 800. It is ok if I go up one more or one down in resolution, but I feel most comfortable with 1280 * 800 resolution, so I wish I can use this setting. :( I use 13' macbook","replies":[]},{"poster":"Thupachump","date":"2017-05-03T18:04:19.110+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"iMac Retina 27\" Late 2015 running OS X 10.12.4\n\nSame issue with game window appearing top right corner with the updated LOL Client. \n\nThe CMD+OPTION+ENTER keys work, but when full screen the top scrolling in game is not working.
