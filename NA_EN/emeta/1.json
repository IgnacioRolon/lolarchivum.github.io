If not your really were just a waste of my time.\n\nAlright.\n\n50 games is a decent chunk. This gives me access to roughly 8% of the champion roster. I'm capable of playing roughly 95% of the champion roster. I frequently pick different champions for different situations. This would prohibit me from doing so.\n\nNext. If I want the other 92% of the champions in the game, I have to play **_500 some matches._** That is a metric shit ton of games. That is nearly **11 days of playtime.** So no, no this isn't a remotely good idea.\n\nChampion mastery is arbitrary anyways. Its a pointless system that says you've played the champion 2-4 times before. This is a completely pointless gate, with a completely trash and pointless system.\n\nYou're right. I'd play the three-four champions I like **frequently** playing to champion mastery 2. I would **not** play 16 champions to mastery 2 because I'd have to be deliberately doing so, and I would certainly not be even capable of playing the entire roster to mastery 2, nor would I want to.\nI don't want to grind. I'm done grinding. I've played this game for going-on 100 days, I have proved my worth. But that's just me personally-- for everybody else, I doubt they want to grind either... Unless they also think that somehow this god-awful system where someone gets carried for 2 games proves that they're better than the next guy actually carries some sort of merit.\n\nHow do I fix the problem? Honestly, I don't because it isn't a problem. The percentage of people who first-time a champion in ranked is not that high. It isn't worth inconveniencing or even outright banning a large portion of the community, casual or otherwise, from ranked play.\nIf we were to start somewhere to clean up ranked play, I'd probably start at an actual problem like trolls in champion-select-- something preventable that _likely_ won't impact many innocent players, unlike this proposed fix that impacts _every_ innocent player.\nEven then, there are problems. Do we impliment a vote-kick system? What stops this from being abused (WTF Kick, Bard isn't OP enough. WTF Kick, taking teleport midlane. Ect,Ect).\n\nRealistically, there are no good fixes for the ranked system, or else they'd likely already be implemented. Champion mastery is definitely not the way to go. If someone is comfortable enough to pick the champion, they should be free to play it. If it upsets you **that** greatly, try the magnificence of queue-dodging.\n\nSeriously, I've gotten to Diamond 3 before, Plat several times edging on yet another on a side account, and mostly because I don't care THAT much. In the moment, in the heat of things, sure I get mad or frustrated, but overall the best attitude is almost a casual one-- just play to play, if you're good you'll climb. Maybe those casuals you oh-so-dislike have a leg up on you in this category.\n\nRanked is not intended to be restricted. It is meant to be open to the good, the bad, the casuals, and the tryhards. Everybody deserves their shot, whether you seem to think so or not.","replies":[{"poster":"macromite","date":"2015-05-16T17:49:50.109+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You made some interesting points in this, but some of them are not entirely edging on your side.\n\nYou say you already have 3-4 champions good to go, now I need to bring in some information considering the OP, that if this change were to be implemented, it would be several months from now, not barring anyone from ranked play for a serious amount of time, about 6 months worth of time, and for most players, 2-4 matches on around 16 characters is about par for the course for such a long stretch of time due to Fotm and all that.

When I do play, its usually my favorite champion, a lot of my gaming fervor has died between college taking over, and my decay out of Diamond.\n\nAgain, for a better excuse to own every champion in ranked, trading is a thing. For my personal excuse, yes, any time I get an unfavorable match-up or feel like changing things up, I'll play a different champion. I do have my favorite champions, but I also pride myself as a bit of a generalist. I might not be the _best_ say, Zac player, but if Zac fits what I need at the time the reward outweights the lost \"mastery.\" Over the course of my ranked history, I've played all but a handful of champions multiple times-- and its simply because I don't own the last few.\n\nI'll skip over the alternative fixes for ranked-- You're probably right, in an ideal world we would have found a fix, but nobody has it atm and it isn't a simple problem, so chances are there wont be any fixes for quite some time.\n\nYes, people can be toxic, but at least its not _thaaaat_ often. The systems in place seem to be doing a pretty good job at cleaning up the game though, I've seen far less than I have in previous seasons. The worst I usually get is a negative nancy.\n\nI strongly believe that Diamond 3 was as skilled as I've ever been. That was realistically my skillcap, between ping, bad decision making, and sub-optimal reaction times. Maybe in the future I'll do better, but casual or not I don't think I'd have done better. Having a more relaxed, casual mindset is honestly the best way to climb. I'm not a huge fan of them, but have you ever checked out pro-streamers? The general attitude is just \"it's just one game, doesn't matter in the long run.\"\nThat isn't to say they don't try, its just that they're very much more casual and relaxed about the situation. This is what I was getting at.\n\nFor the last paragraph, I addressed it earlier. It's of my personal belief that teamcomps and counter-picks are strong enough points to substitute out a little champion mastery in exchange for. A bad teamcomp or an un-winnable lane crushes your team at champion select.
