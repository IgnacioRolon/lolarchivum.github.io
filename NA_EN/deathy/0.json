Also to the people playing all for one, just a tip picking high damage of 1 type is easily counter like this, later in the video you just see how much i care taking all the focus, while my team kill them.","url":"https://youtu.be/icTkfMwFrxk","image":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/icTkfMwFrxk/hqdefault.jpg"},"up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"There a list of champion that are good and fun to play, and other are just damn right Tryhard which are basically near 100% win, Riot Got rid of Teemo, Karthus (for many easy reason)\r\n\r\nBut an there still a few champion just as annoying , so i&#039;ll list the top &quot;try&quot;hard  which are the nearly normal bands, even from the all for one previous time\r\n\r\nand here some items to try help you win if you ever vs these type of people.\r\n\r\nthe list goes as\r\n\r\n {{champion:74}}  - Get the item {{item:3060}} - if there no AD guy, all the turret do 0 damage to the banner making it the perfect sieging item on the turret squad\r\n\r\n{{champion:203}} - this is not an &quot;OP&quot; a lot of people spam these, and as they are mainly AD, just get armor, and you just got get the Early Game, the video link is me and my mate playing a goof around game and you can see how useless they become later , only reason they are hard to fight, cause Wolf control the whole lane, and an Army of wolfs will mean dead for most squshies/none mega tanks\r\n\r\n{{champion:26}} -Not only their bomb and stack making an unlimited stun combo team, but zil can go AD with out much fear cause how early game bomb hurt , and as I mention the stun combo, the best way to fight these is get an GA, and just get tanky enough for them to burn all their mana down, before you fight them (let not forget zil passive, making them out level your 5x quicker)\r\n\r\n{{champion:223}} - They all can get you stacked fast, and Eat you in matter of second and stun you , and eat again, also they can save each other and pretty much be annoying, the best way to fight these guy, slow their movement, stun them, and just keep distance enough to kite these guys.\r\n\r\n{{champion:122}} - If you vs an Dunkin&#039; Team , getting Armor doesn&#039;t help, as black clever, and their bleeding would ruin it, so the best avice is, keep your stance, and hopefully your range, so you can kite them without being pull. as they can Tank, or go damage, and once 1 person has the 5 stack, then ext daruis hit it, renew the timer, and they get it autoly as well, and don&#039;t need mention level 3 dunk no mana cost threat i&#039;m sure.\r\n\r\n{{champion:9}} - Prema Fear, these will leave you nightmare as your life is drain slowly, the best way to fight then, give minion {{item:3060}}   wave, and just let them do the work for you.\r\n\r\n{{champion:12}} - the Head but and pop up, these play on alister know how to do the head but smash combo, make you pretty much 100% dead early game, just out tank them, and you should be fine. if your a squshie team, Then try widdle their HP down the best you can to make them use ult, then kill them after ult off, or you will lose.\r\n\r\n{{champion:54}} the unstoppable pop up , no way to survie this unless your MR is 300 + with huge mana regen\r\n\r\n\r\n{{champion:143}} - the plants are going make you Cry, they easy to kill as they are all going go AP, so just get MR, and get ready to dive them hard after they use their seed up , also try pick them alone.\r\n\r\n{{champion:82}} - as their ability to keep full exp, they can out level you in lane, and just take your soul, and dragon soul (good thing they all don&#039;t get dragon pets) so best way to counter them , murder them early game and get the lead, mord has hard time catching back up.\r\n\r\nThese are mainly the &quot;try&quot; hard champion that will basically win, and also be majorly picked, I rather have fun food around champ matches, in this game mode for &quot;fun&quot; not spend 20 mins basically hiding under tower with hardly CS ability to farm, or be at base before 20 mins, thatm ake league unappealing , and picking &quot;the OP&quot; champions to just win, is shameless in mode that will be gone, and the win and lose won&#039;t be kept, so it be fun to see some games like Trundle vs Ramus or Draven vs Draven, Ahri vs Kass, and ect - and the reason im posting how to counter these pick, cause this how ih elp my team almost win, but still lost after the bad early game.\r\n\r\n\r\nDo you have your own ideal and items recommend to shut down some champions that are very hard and annoying to do anything and try help , feel free to post, and don&#039;t be jerks about this, if you ever play vsin&#039; these guy while your palying an not as powerful champion cause you wanted to have fun, you understand the annoyance of these guys.","replies":[{"poster":"Jbels","date":"2015-10-18T04:33:12.045+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"lol what?
