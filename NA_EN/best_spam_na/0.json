Please. Can you take 250 RP from me and give an icon to one of my friends, please? That person cannot get an icon and I want to give him a C9 icon, because we're C9 Fans and I don't want the joy of using that inside game animation be take from us. :( Please.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-28T15:50:01.842+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately, that's something we cannot do. =/\n\nAnother option to ensure your friend gets the C9 icon and the emote to spam during games is to gift your friend RP so they can buy the icon themself.
