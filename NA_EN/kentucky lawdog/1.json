Problem is, typically, the other jungler, not having gone the Devourer enchant, has continued to gank the lanes putting our team at a huge disadvantage.  By the time 20 minutes roll around, half the time it&#039;s already /ff.\r\n\r\nThe worst is that you will politely ask for them to gank/ping them/try to get their attention which will result in them either: 1.  Telling you to play it safe and they will gank later after getting sated; or 2.  Insulting you for sucking at your lane (which is most often the unfortunate case).\r\n\r\n**Proposed Solution: ** When jungling, you are still a part of the team.  If you choose to try and get sated, remember, having a kill or assist grants a stack too.  Ganking a lane and being part of the team will help you.  In addition to that additional stack, that kill will grant you additional knowledge which will help you effectively safely take the dragon (granting 5 stacks) or jungle invading (granting you additional stacks and denying the enemy jungler/team gold).\r\n\r\n**Definition of Devourer:** Devouring causes _**takedowns (kills or assists)**_ to grant Devourer stacks, increasing on-hit magic damage by +1. Takedowns on: Large monsters and _**champions grant 1 stack**_. Rift Scuttlers grant 2 stacks. Dragon and Baron Nashor grant 5 stacks.","replies":[]}
