This would not only explain why you are experiencing the slowness in the game, but why your MS counter doesn't change.  To dig a little deeper into what the root cause could be, make sure to use our [Connection Analyzer Tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743).

However, if this was on the server-end in terms of a root cause, then all 9 other players connecting to the same game server you are would be experiencing the same exact issue.  Since that doesn't seem to be the case, then we need to start looking elsewhere for the root cause.\n\nTo confirm however, were you able to run the Connection Analyzer?  You mentioned you've completed the \"connection load testing\", but I wasn't sure if this was the same as the Analyzer tool itself.  Did the Analyzer tool confirm that your connection is completely fine?  Did it give any other kind of results?\n\nReply back and let me know!","replies":[{"poster":"Dolterius","date":"2016-05-20T23:19:35.912+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"sigh every time blame the client side connection as if its the only answer i checked the logs from the client ZERO PACKET LOSS its not my connection or every game i have would also lag. and its not even connection related at all i said its FPS as in graphical.\n\ni know for 100% fact its has nothing to do with my connection as i mentioned before that would effect every game i play not only this one.  i even set up a dual boot 2nd install of my windows 7 and installed the required pre-req software and drivers and a fresh LoL and it still happens so it is either a problem in the client having issues with my video card drivers or the most recent drivers for my card are conflicting.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Over lmmortal","date":"2016-05-19T21:34:25.480+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That sounds a bit like MS spikes.
