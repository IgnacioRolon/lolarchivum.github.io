So for the quests it asks you to win 1 game, and it gives you two icons, then asks you to win a game with 1 of those icons, I won one with the Chaos icon because all my friends were going to use that one too, and we got the chaos tokens for completing that quest, but what about the other quest? Me personally I'd really like the load in screen thing for Riven, but now the only quests I have are, win 7 games (I think it was 7, lmao) and get 10 assists while using the Chaos icon in game, will I get a chance to get Order Tokens? Or will I bet stuck with the Chaos quests? I dunno, I'm just confused, so my bad if I'm making no sense XDXDXD\r\n\r\n-HOACH","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-16T04:52:13.699+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"No worries coach! These missions are a pretty big new addition to League, so there are bound to be a lot of questions ^_^!\n\nYou'll still be able to get Order tokens, but you'll have to wait for the daily missions to refresh tomorrow. Each day you can complete new daily missions, and you can freely switch sides each day. I'd recommend sticking with one side that way you'll be helping one side win in the final battle, and you'll also be accumulating the type of tokens you want!","replies":[{"poster":"HOACH","date":"2017-06-16T05:01:43.856+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you! I was  originally wanting to go for the Order, but went with the Chaos so we could all be matching that game XD Thank you again btw <3","replies":[]}]}]}
