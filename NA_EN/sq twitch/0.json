I mean. the guy told me to kill myself and Im just playing a normals draft pick with my friend and I tell him its not my fault I dont gank a 0/7 mid and I did insult his friends who queued but it seems like I got the wrong punishment here because I wasnt even very toxic.  These people were telling me to kill myself and that Im a trash jg and the trash jg isnt really bad to me but when im 12/1 and the only player doing even and then when I get out of the game and Im permabanned for saying things back that arent even threats or insults it seems kind of discouraging.  I agree my previous offences on my other bans were justified but I was really trying to keep my cool and just have fun on my account and it seems like people get away with much worse when im just trying to have a fun game.  I didnt expect to get told to kill myself because I didnt gank mid and that im a trash jg and useless and them putting it in all chat as well and when I say why go sivir support and xayah adc and complain when you feed im the one whos toxic?. also the previous game with my friend was the warwick and it was friendly banter as we were in a discord laughing at our stupid plays but I guess the system took it as toxicity.  I hope you can get back to me about this as I really tried to clean my act.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DevlinCrow","date":"2017-08-29T23:03:03.214+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sometimes you get bad team-mates, sometimes people will flame you for nothing & sometimes you'll get annoyed.\n\nYou have to not say anything and continue playing as normal, learn to ignore them.
