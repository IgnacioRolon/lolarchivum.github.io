It is very confusing because I have only one account(I made this one since I can&#039;t post on the forums with the main one now), and I haven&#039;t posted on the boards in over 7 months. I also have never received any suspension before and to my knowledge have only received one warning for negative attitude. So how can my account be perma-banned? If anyone could help I would be very appreciative, I posted a support ticket but Riot has not gotten back to me and all my purchases and time are in that account.\r\n\r\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"Keyru","date":"2017-04-20T01:58:59.714+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey ItsBTrue,\n\nI'll work with you in the ticket.\n\nIn short, your account was proactively locked due to being linked to another player who earlier in the week posted a ton of inappropriate mature content.

I can not assist you any more than what I've already said via the Boards.  There is no other way to deal with this situation.\n\nTo be clear, as someone whose account is permanently suspended from the Boards, you're not allowed to post on other accounts.  The only reason I haven't suspended the account you're on now is to explain to you how to contact Riot regarding this.  I can not assist you any further.

And if it turns out its not, just have him change his email address and password, and leave him the fuck alone. \n\nMaybe he bought the account. probably cuz you banned his previous accounts. Also i am disgusting a communist authoritarian Riot employee uses the tag Mod Razgriz. Razgriz is for people who believe in liberty. not sick minded elitists on a power trip cuz they were a beta male in high school or because they want to protect themselves legally. well news flash that is all bullshit. People should be liable for their own accounts. You shouldn't even be banning people permanently for speech. Anti freedom menaces do that. At most, a 1 month ban, and put them in low priority queues if they don't change.\n\nI went back and read the terms of use and immediately said nope fuck Riot you should not be able to seize my account on a whim. \n\nThere are plenty of people who do not remember all their information when they first made an account and they do not care to remember.
