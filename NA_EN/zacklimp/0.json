I then went to open a chest but the game seemed to bug out. Now I'm missing a key, and I can't remember if I was at the number of chests that I currently have, or if it opened the chest and I just couldn't see the loot.

I've got your hextech history pulled up, and it looks like you got the Pentakill Karthus skin shard from that chest. I do see him in your hextech loot, so be sure to check for that shard there!","replies":[]}]}
