All of which happen to be midlaners, junglers, adcs, etc. Everyone gets excited for these new champs and plays them in there designated roles. However, with autofill especially now, support is so boring because the good champs like Janna just aren&#039;t fun to play. It&#039;s like maining malphite in the top lane. \r\n\r\nI always get in games where people are autofilled to support, and they just complain the whole time. Personally i can&#039;t blame them because i like champions that are fun and are diverse. Like thresh, he has cc and he can help the ADC to safety and set up kills. What a fun support to master. Also his hook isn&#039;t that hard to land either and can shut down an adc.\r\n\r\nAdding a new support champion to the game would strike a rise in people wanting to play support, as long as they make a fun one. Seeing all these new diverse champions that are fun to play in other roles  just makes support even worse. Let me know what you think.","replies":[{"poster":"Revali","date":"2016-11-26T20:51:19.945+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"{{champion:427}} isn't even that old.","replies":[{"poster":"Zëd Lęppelin","date":"2016-11-26T20:58:21.595+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"{{champion:427}} isn't even a support.","replies":[{"poster":"Oglaf","date":"2016-11-27T01:44:11.800+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Arzonv,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Ys8ZZNAt,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2016-11-26T20:58:21.595+0000)\n>\n> {{champion:427}} isn&#x27;t even a support.\n\nRiot wants him to be though; he is classified as one.\n\nSo they've probably checked the \"Released Support Champ\" box.\n\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-clap}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Revali","date":"2016-11-26T21:09:01.328+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wasn't aware being a jg doesn't make him a support.","replies":[{"poster":"reaperteaser","date":"2016-11-26T21:47:17.159+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"hes secondry support, primary jgl.\n\nhe can support, but its like maokai support, hes more effective in another position.  also he ends up being alot squishier when he supports, so of he uses his passive to pick up the xtra red/blue buff the enemy can steal it easier","replies":[{"poster":"ChaddyFantome","date":"2016-11-28T21:26:10.640+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=reaperteaser,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Ys8ZZNAt,comment-id=0000000000000000,timestamp=2016-11-26T21:47:17.159+0000)\n>\n> hes secondry support, primary jgl.\n> \n> he can support, but its like maokai support, hes more effective in another position.  also he ends up being alot squishier when he supports, so of he uses his passive to pick up the xtra red/blue buff the enemy can steal it easier\n\nJungle is a position, not a role.\nHe is primary support.

Isn't the point of his kit for jungle? I'm just saying, for people like me, who don't like the support role because it's too boring. There should be a more diverse and skill oriented support released. Not saying other supports don't require skill, but you rely on landing just 1 cc or heal, and then you just stand in the back or peel, not very fun.\n\nYou're already treated like garbage by other teammates, so maybe a support that can actually do some flashy plays might get some recognition.","replies":[{"poster":"Mysticman89","date":"2016-11-26T23:55:36.562+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean lots of them can make plays currently. Bard can do lots of fancy things, Thresh is a swiss army knife of plays, Ali can make things happen, etc. Almost all meta supports are so because they can make fight changing plays (for the most part if they're 'only' healing or shielding, then they're probably not actually realising the potential of that support).\n\nIt's kinda amazing to watch high elo supports play in relatively low elo games, as they make so much happen. I think a lot of the issue is the people playing support not actually being good enough to recognize the potential of most supports, and that's a difficult problem to work around.\n\nFlashy plays that result in a lot of direct damage are unlikely to be a thing, since then they're prone to being played in a solo lane where they're even scarier (as there they still have access to their kit that allows that, but also extra levels and gold). CC and heals/shields are the most obvious forms of utility, and utility is what makes supports supports. Theres certainly other forms of utility (e.g. bards magical journey, iverns brush making) and it'll be interesting to see what riot might come up with, but it's almost certainly not going to be raw damage, and unfortunately it's raw damage that tends to garner recognition from the community.","replies":[{"poster":"Skàld","date":"2016-11-27T01:43:01.258+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not looking for damage, which is why I mentioned thresh. Ali is pretty good too, but it just seems as though your team still treats you like garbage. People are still mentioning Ivern, not sure why. I don't mean support jg, and even if he was support, he doesn't look very fun. Whenever someone thinks of a \"tryhard\" role where someone with a high skill level is playing, they think of adc or mid. Support is such a down played role. Champs like ivern make it worse imo. You got yasuo, zed, talon doing cool plays while looking cool. Then you got champions like Ivern where your team treats you as the weakest link.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"DrugsForRobots","date":"2016-11-26T22:47:42.751+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A couple of supports that play with vision or have vision-centric kits would be great.","replies":[]}]}
