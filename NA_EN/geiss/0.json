I clicked it and it opened the launch to download the new update, sweet. I left my PC while it was updating to come back to it only had updated 1.0mb and an ETA of 350mins. ANyways the client kept loading little by little and then it would close, and then restart. SO I was like... ok i'll re download it. Redownload it and now I cannot get the launcher open. I click on it and it brings up the League of Legends icon and has the loading bar with a slight amount of yellow on it, but it doesn't move. I have tried all the help solutions on the support page, but nothing is working. Can someone please assist. After a while the launcher closes and nothing happens.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-28T03:33:35.712+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeeeaaaaa that definitely shouldn't take 350 mins to download a simple patch.
