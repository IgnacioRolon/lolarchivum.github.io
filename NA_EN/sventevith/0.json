Please read this.","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":7,"down_votes":4,"body":"Okay i get this a lot during game play and a lot of people do not understand this. I am told many times that if i buy wota and gunblade together i will not get 40% spellvamp i will only get 20% spellvamp\r\n\r\nNow everyone of these items have their own Unique passive. What people have told me over and over that unqiue passives DO NOT STACK. YES I AM FULLY AWARE OF THAT. THE UNIQUE PASSIVE IS ONLY ACCOUNTED FOR THAT RESPECTED ITEM, so I cannot stack any of the listed items below and give me double spell vamp. example > 2 x wota or 2 x gun blade.\r\n\r\nTHIS IS WHAT I CAN DO. BUY WOTA AND A GUNBLADE AND GIVE ME 40% SPELL VAMP. THEN I COULD BUY SPIRIT VISAGE Which has a unique passive: Increases self healing, health regen, lifesteal, and spell vamp effects buy 20%. which total up to 48% spell vamp.\r\n\r\nItems\r\nGuinsoo's Rageblade Guinsoo's Rageblade: Unique Passive: Falling below 50% health grants you +10% spell vamp, +20% attack speed, and +10% life steal until out of combat (30 second cooldown). +30 attack damage, +40 ability power. Passive: Basic attacks and spell casts grants +4% attack speed and +4 ability power for 8 seconds (stacks up to 8 times). 2600 gold.\r\nHextech Revolver Hextech Revolver: Unique Passive: +12% spell vamp. +40 ability power. 1200 gold.\r\nHextech Gunblade Hextech Gunblade: Unique Passive: +20% spell vamp, +40 attack damage, +80 ability power, +10% life steal. Unique Passive: Basic attacks (on hit) and single-target spells against champions reduce the cooldown of this item by 3 seconds. Unique Active: Deals 150 + (40% AP) magic damage and slows the target champion's movement speed by 40% for 2 seconds (60 second cooldown). 3400 gold.\r\nWill of the Ancients Will of the Ancients: Unique Passive: +20% spell vamp. +80 ability power, +10% cooldown reduction. 2500 gold.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd one more thing. Mordekaiser was the first champ I've played, since season 1. I've noticed a bug that i have filed a few times before and it still is not fixed. mordekaiser's q has a bug where when he swings his mace hitting a target striking up to 3 additional nearby targets. every so often that does not happen and i only hit one target near buy. there have been multiple occasions where i have died or failed to get a kill because it did not strike additional the additional target (minion / champion)\r\n\r\nThe picture i posted will explain the bug.","replies":[{"poster":"Sailor Mint","date":"2015-02-01T06:48:10.272+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"tl;dr:\nNamed Unique Passives (i.e.: Mana Font) do not stack.\nUnnamed Unique Passives (i.e.: +10% CDR) stack if they come from different sources.","replies":[{"poster":"SouL1ess","date":"2015-02-01T08:32:58.768+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You would think people understand this by now...\n\nSame with the great \"[release] BC can get you to -125% armor!\" crap.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SouL1ess","date":"2015-02-01T08:34:34.945+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The Q bug probably results from Q only registering targets at the moment that damage is dealt, not as Morde swings his mace. \n\nIf Blitz walked too far before you hit the minion he may had walked out of range, although I doubt it because Mace of Spades mult-target range is somewhat long...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Phife","date":"2015-02-01T06:50:25.578+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"question is: why do you want that much spell vamp?","replies":[{"poster":"Sventevith","date":"2015-02-01T06:53:36.117+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Spell vamped has saved my life numerous times.","replies":[{"poster":"Yulen Xoshxius","date":"2015-02-01T08:04:42.990+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also for fun.
