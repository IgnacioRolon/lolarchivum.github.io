If an enemy champion is next to a minion, and only the enemy champion is ablaze, I ult the enemy champion, the ult won&#039;t bounce to the minion, even if they are directly next to each other, it just stops at the enemy champion. IDK if this is a bug or not, but it&#039;s dumb and should be fixed","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-02-05T17:00:06.963+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Pertsho - \n\nThanks for the report!
