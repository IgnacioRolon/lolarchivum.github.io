These are to play at a high level.\n\nKindred fundamentally teaches you the jg, how to play the strategy of jg due to their reliance on kiting, the nature of their passive marks (teaches you how to predict and manage camps, when to invade, how to invade.. the decisions leading up to it)\n\nSyndra is highly reliant on positioning and timing, as well as micromanaging her spheres.. to a larger extent than Orianna in most aspects.  Also, her ability to cast while moving is something very few people, if any, have completely mastered....  Theoretically she should be able to dodge every skillshot while landing her skillshots... and always be moving smartly, but most people will be unable to do this beyond kiting whilst running away.\n\nTaliyah (and Ryze and TF tbh but to a lesser/different extent :/) particularly in regards to her ult... It may be game changing, can make or break games.. learning how and when to use it is key,  She has no damage on it, and all her abilities are also skillshots soooo, yh there's also that..   The worked ground nature of her Q and passive means you need to learn how to position and think about how, where and why you use the Q.\n\nElise... is just difficult cuz she has 7 spells, transforming champs that have their kits change (nidalee and jayce) are difficult for this reason... Elise to a larger extent because her kit is more complicated imo.\n\nRyze is all about how you chain your abilities (Leblanc too to an extent...tho she's more binary usually.. wish they'd revert the revert)\n\nJhin, jhin is a beautiful champ who's currently overpowered xD... but yh, he's fundamentally different from ADC's in that his auto attack system is much weirder... requires you to pay attention to how you use them, he's also skillshot reliant\n\nCassio, much like Syndra, is all about positioning...   Functionally acts like a marksman tbh.   Managing the poison, moving and avoiding damage all whilst keeping up damage efficiency via the E\n\nAzir is hard due to micromanaging his soldiers and their autos while also keeping in mind you are the champ too so need to move and avoid damage\n\nVayne requires mechanical skill like most adcs, however she's much closer ranged with no real skillshots, so is positioning reliant moreso than others... tho she does have her mobility and invis to help :/\n\nRiven is reliant on animation cancelling, a fundamental technique to learn\n\nBard, Bard is hard due to his Q being reliant on other factors to stun, his E is about taking a magical journey and his ult is a potentially troll ability... alongside it being hard to land due to its timing.","replies":[{"poster":"DamSonWhUFndThis","date":"2018-09-28T11:06:59.651+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"reading this is like listening to Mozart (wich I'm listening at Mozart atm while reading this witch even elevated enjoyment of reading this anyway....)\nYou explained really good how other champs differanciate in the skill level and cap through example champions I like that thank you\n\nand have a nice day or night &lt;3 :)","replies":[{"poster":"Psyrix","date":"2018-10-02T16:06:34.081+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=DamSonWhUFndThis,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=cdAVu0XV,comment-id=00070000,timestamp=2018-09-28T11:06:59.651+0000)\n>\n> reading this is like listening to Mozart (wich I'm listening at Mozart atm while reading this witch even elevated enjoyment of reading this anyway....)\n> You explained really good how other champs differanciate in the skill level and cap through example champions I like that thank you\n> \n> and have a nice day or night &lt;3 :)\n\naww, thank youuuu haha.

And even when you are stomping on Nida you can easily get caught and did, she's not a powerhouse.\n\nAnd Kalista is not only (imo) the hardest champ to play mechanically, she's also with a pile of nerfs on top of her that makes her even harder to play with the range nerf that she got a few months agosto, and needing good synergy with her support to make proper use of her ultimate.","replies":[]}]}
