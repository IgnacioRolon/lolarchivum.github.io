As confused as I was, I went ahead and changed the name. After doing so, it asked mt to play tutorials and such, as a new account would have to. After clicking skip on all of them, I find that my account was reset to level 1. All the time and money I have put into this game has now gone to waste. I would like some kind of explaination as to what could have caused my account to suffer this kind of punishment","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2018-01-04T23:56:29.611+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It honestly sounds like you might be logging into an incorrect account.

The summoner on your list is spelled differently.  NA is technically not supposed to have special characters, so I highly recommend everyone sticking to normal NA characters to help avoid issues like this.  ><\n\n","replies":[]}]}]}
