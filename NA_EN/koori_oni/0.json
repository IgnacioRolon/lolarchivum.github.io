All the other PROJECTs appear finished, but these guys? They're mean to be forgotten outsiders, some finished, some not. Some are broken/damaged. Some aren't even using PROJECT parts(the whiter/shinier/animal bits are likely from Programs).","replies":[]},{"poster":"AbiwonKenabi","date":"2019-07-16T03:18:31.557+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Honestly, I can see where you're coming from. Its bizarre that she doesn't have the hallmark Neon \"zing\" that literally every PROJECT skin has. If you look at some previous skins:\n\nhttps://www.mobafire.com/images/champion/skins/landscape/vi-project.jpg\n\nVi has her obvious glowing fists of fury to contrast with the dark PROJECT setting.\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/389s3z6gv8e21.jpg\n\nPROJECT Vayne's crossbow really pops, and the whole splash is bathed in a neon glow. \n\nhttps://cdna.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/010/611/492/large/alex-flores-project-jhin-final-alexflores.jpg?1525321060\n\nYou've got Jhin, who is a little more subtle, but has a very distinct PROJECT-y helmet with the glowing symbol.\n\nAnd just every other PROJECT splash besides: \n\nhttps://www.mobafire.com/images/champion/skins/landscape/fiora-project.jpg\nhttps://cdna.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/001/185/088/large/joshua-brian-smith-project-lucian.jpg?1443929975\nhttps://www.mobafire.com/images/champion/skins/landscape/master-yi-project.jpg\n\n(Even Yi, the \"original\", where they were still figuring out the aesthetic!) \n\nThen you look at Jinx, and she just doesn't have that same Neon accent at all. Sure, her color palette is using some neon purples, but its not providing any sort of light source. The splash as a whole is just far too bright, not even the others of this same batch are like that. Its just too bright for the gritty cyberpunk aesthetic. Demacian Vice has the neon color palettes without have the \"glow\" of PROJECT's accents against its dark colors, so I could see how one might think it would fit better with Demacian Vice. \n\n(BTW, I hope all these images show up, we'll see)","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheMan292","date":"2019-07-15T22:21:20.272+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"she looks like she belongs to that gamer zoe skin universe to be honest","replies":[{"poster":"AbiwonKenabi","date":"2019-07-16T03:01:21.804+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Cyberpop, yeah.
