I'm on the NA projects team and we want to clarify plans around NA’s future as a server. Currently, service is not equal across the region, and that *sucks*. Even worse, it feels like we’ve talked about plans to improve things for a long, long time with no real visible action taken. We currently have multiple projects aimed at addressing ping issues in NA, so read on.\n\nYesterday, we were so excited to start talking about the new server infrastructure build, but we chose our words poorly. While technically we’re rebuilding the servers from the ground up somewhere new, the word “migration” naturally sounds like we’re moving to a central location, which we’re not ready for just yet. \n\nWe want to apologize for the confusion, and do more than say “we’re working on it,” because you’ve all heard that before. Allow us to put the infrastructure rebuild into context and map out the three-phase plan we’ve outlined for NA. We can’t promise to dish details about everything because we’re still finalizing some projects, but we can give you a better idea of what we’re doing behind the curtain.\n\nRight now, there are three main issues with the NA server environment:\n\n 1. **Out-of-date infrastructure (poor stability)** *[COMPLETE!]*\n\n 2. **ISP traffic routing (network optimization)** *[HARDWARE COMPLETE -- PEERING AGREEMENTS ONGOING]*\n\n 3. **Server location (ping distribution)** *[CENTRALIZED SERVER RELOCATION COMPLETE!]*\n\nIdeally, we’d tackle all three at the same time, but these are big changes and we want to make sure we’re getting each one right before moving on to the next step. Measure twice, cut once.\n\n1. The Infrastructure team is leading the charge on building a [**new server infrastructure**](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/riot-official/0YOGUwHG-stability-upgrade-and-planned-migration-for-na-servers) from the ground up to make sure the game experience is stable and more secure. Instability causes cascading problems like fluctuating ping, downtime, and poor service, so we want to address this challenge first. Expect a more stable connection on these shiny, sturdy servers this November.\n\n2. The Internet Optimization team is actively working with ISPs across the US and Canada to build what’s known as an **internet backbone** for League players. This backbone will decrease variances and chokepoints in connections across the region, resulting in a better optimized connection to those shiny new servers. Expect these internet superhighways to roll out in early 2015.\n\n3. Finally, our team is dedicated to scoping out what will ultimately be the **new location** that the NA servers and optimized backbone connections will call home. We aren’t ready to share where this new home will be or when this project team will be ready for prime-time, but we want you to know that the ultimate goal is providing a comparable, stable ping no matter which coast you’re playing from. As these first two projects finalize, we’ll know more and will be ready to share additional details.\n\nStay tuned for more info from us in the future!\n \n- RiotPDB, NA Projects Team\n\n*[Edit to add in all the official updates made so far to the NA Server Roadmap - comments will be disabled here and historical posts, please jump into the latest thread to post questions or add to the discussion!]*\n\n[**NA Server Roadmap Update: Optimizing the Internet for League and You**](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/AMupzBHw-na-server-roadmap-update-optimizing-the-internet-for-league-and-you)\n[**NA Server Roadmap Update: PoPs, Peering and the North Bridge**](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/0hVNFnPH-na-server-roadmap-update-pops-peering-and-the-north-bridge)\n[**NA Server Roadmap Update: Addressing the Q's in Quality Connections**](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/APgXgX6W-na-server-roadmap-update-addressing-the-qs-in-quality-connections)\n[**NA Server Roadmap: South Bridge update**](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/hXxTbpiI-na-server-roadmap-south-bridge-update)\n[**NA Server Roadmap Update: South Bridge pt. 2 & ISP Peering**](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/Ffh2dJXf-na-server-roadmap-update-south-bridge-pt-2-isp-peering)\n\n\n[**NA Server Roadmap Update: Chicago Here We Come**](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/ZwVkoboV-na-server-roadmap-update-chicago-here-we-come)\n[**NA Server Roadmap Update: Upcoming NA Server Move**](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/q8sJLh1M-na-server-roadmap-update-upcoming-na-server-move)\n[**NA Server Roadmap Update: NA Server Move on 8/25**](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/U0M1AVfO-na-server-roadmap-update-na-server-move-on-825?sort_type=recent)\n[**NA Server Roadmap Update: Details on 8/25 Server Move**](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/tTVEnWAq-na-server-roadmap-update-na-server-move-on-825)","replies":[{"poster":"Redamntion","date":"2014-10-08T04:07:20.749+0000","up_votes":241,"down_votes":33,"body":"#3 is literally exactly the same shit you said 2 years ago.\n\nWhy would you think this would make us any happier?\nYou haven't even finalized a location and you have #1 (end of year), \nand #2 (indefinite...

Now you're telling us you don't even have a date for it? How is this acceptable?\n\nYou're just ignoring more than half of the players in the game. More than half the players are on the east side.\n\n\"We want to fix ping fluctuation\" bro, the players who have the most ping fluctuation are from the east coast. Oh woe the poor babies in California who have to deal with a ping fluctuation of like 20ms. God forbid they have to play the game at 50ms while the rest of us are stuck at 120! Ping fluctuation isn't even that big of a deal. Really. If we actually had *good ping to start with* it really wouldn't be a problem, but people complaining about ping fluctuation are those people who fluctuate between **120 and 160**.\n\nAlmost every skillshot is undodgeable. My ping is literally higher than the necessary reaction time to dodge pretty much any fast moving skillshot. Seriously, before it even shows up on my screen I'm already hit by it.  When I see players in LCS dodge dark bindings I think it's absolutely incredible. As if it's a superhuman feat. Put yourself in the shoes of someone from east coast NA, where *dodging a morgana Q is considered a seriously clutch play*.\n\nThe fact that you actually had a plan to move these servers years ago means you just haven't made any attempt to make good on that.

Currently, we don’t have any news regarding the central server location, and we’ve done a miserable job of managing the communication that lead us to this point. Lots of false starts and cruddy promise keeping on our end. You guys feeling exhausted and frustrated by this point is fully justified.Moving forward, we’re aiming to be a lot clearer by sharing results and action rather than projections and speculation.\n\nSecond: I’d agree with your assessment that what the community wants to hear is news on the central server location. However, we felt it was important to also update players on the larger problem you outlined: the where/when/how we’ll reduce East Coast ping. The truth is a central server location isn’t a silver bullet solution. That’s why we’re exploring several approaches, such as the ones outlined in this original post, all of which are aimed at different ways to improved stability, connectivity, and ping for players coast to coast.","replies":[{"poster":"WormsWoods","date":"2014-10-09T03:58:46.247+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":3,"body":"So do we do in the mean time?

Additionally, this isn’t a linear process – we can and are pursuing all three of these initiatives simultaneously.\n\nOne nuance I want to communicate is that the physical location of the game servers is just one part of the equation. Specifically, the backbone we discussed (#2) is far more flexible than may have come across in our original post – it’s not a one-way highway to the current servers. Wherever the game servers end up, it’s essential that we build out a dedicated highway for League traffic that sidesteps the various nooks and crannies of the internet’s landscape. Long-term, this should lead to a variety of coast-to-coast stability and latency improvements as we continue to expand the backbone. As we speak, we’re already working on the infrastructure and dealing with ISPs around the continent in order deliver results ASAP. \n\nI get that this might not mean much until you guys see results (actions mean more than words), but we hope to have real progress to share by the end of the year.","replies":[{"poster":"ElPotatoDiablo","date":"2014-10-09T04:04:01.655+0000","up_votes":30,"down_votes":4,"body":"One nuance that -I- want to communicate is that your priorities suck. \n\nI get what you're saying, but I think you miss from those of us that have been playing on East Coast forever that we don't give a shit anymore.

As I mentioned earlier, truck loads of servers are purchased, we just need to lock down the data center contract and get the Internet circuits installed. In the meantime the servers near Portland, OR will see connection improvement for many players as the direct connections to the major ISPs and telcos get installed (more are getting hooked up every week). We were maxed out of quality space, Internet bandwidth, and power in the Los Angeles area so Oregon was the best choice at the time to get large amounts of servers up and running (Facebook, Apple and a few other major players are an easy drive away), it is technically only 7-9 msec further away from the LA area (if LA was the better place, it is not for all players) but we need to optimize the routing and circuit mix to really achieve the best possible connection for all players to the Oregon located servers. The team is working long hours to get this done.\n\n>In the last few months many players were likely getting first routed to LA then to Portland through San Jose or sometime weirdly through Seattle. Now lots of players are taking a much more direct route to just San Jose and then Portland if you are not in the Southwest USA or you will likely pass through Seattle then to Portland if you are in the Northwest USA or coming out of most of Canada. So ping time for many players should have gone down in the last month (but not for all). This will continue to optimize for more players as we get more telcos and ISPs directly connected. \n\n>Another team is focused on getting game servers spun up more centrally which will then allow Oregon to become the fall back site if things go into the ditch in a bad way (something we have not had as option in the past). **So net, Oregon is a temporary hop which has allowed us to significantly expand the number of game servers and other resources we have needed to help stabilize NA.** Next step is to optimize ping time for as many players as we can in Oregon and then a more central to NA location which we will tell you about as soon as we lock it down. \n\n>-sonicdeathmonk\n\nhttp://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/board/showthread.php?p=45503129#45503129\n\nYour step 2 & 3\n\nsonicdeathmonk 02-24-2014\n\n> We are working on getting game servers more centrally located in North America.

Key changes coming first is a direct connection to the San Jose, CA and Seattle, WA located Internet Exchanges, this should reduce ping time a bit even for East Coast players (while also improving our DDoS defense). These Internet Exchanges bring us direct connections to many more USA and Canadian ISPs, cable companies, and telecoms than we have directly connected today in NA.** Connections are ordered, so not too much longer to wait.**\n\n> We also have truck loads of game servers built and waiting to be delivered closer to the Eastern US Coast as soon as we nail down the best place to put them to benefit the most NA players. **This year for sure, hopefully soon.** Won't be able to give everyone in the US 20 msec ping time but I think we will achieve getting most player closer to the same ping time (and still keep almost everyone faster than a Ferrari FXX can shift gears).\n\n> -sonicdeathmonk\n\nhttp://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/board/showthread.php?p=45393275#\n\ntl;dr= You already promised us this back in February and March. 7-8 months later you recycle the old promise without any time frame.

I'm afraid you might cause outrage in groups that currently are not upset with you at all.\nAllow me to outline some of my concerns about moving the servers:\n\n* If you chose a central location, the area of NA with the smallest population will be getting the best ping, which is pretty much a decision to give the best ping to the smallest amount of people possible.\n\n* The pro players currently live as close to the server as they can to get the best ping, and consider the game unplayable at 40 ping. Moving to a central location is handing them that 40 or more ping along with basically a middle finger. They will be forced to move to the new server location.\n\n* West coast residents will be more than upset that you have intentionally chosen to increase their ping. If you chose a more eastern location to give the best ping to a high population than a central location would, West coast will be even more pissed off. Suddenly you would have threads popping up full of outrage about **West coast ping**.\n\nPlease, Riot. NA is huge. You don't try to force other countries to all fit onto one server, even though many other countries are significantly smaller than NA. Why are you trying to force NA onto a single server?\nIt's obvious that the best option is to provide both an East and West coast locations, so instead of doing one or the other or in between, and pissing one or both groups off, why not east and west coast servers?\n\nPlease, Riot. It is obvious that your players don't want this.

Perhaps we haven't gotten through yet. These new boards have definitely made it easier to get attention. What else can we do exactly? The language seems to be excluding NA east, instead it's just \"moving servers.\" If they moved the server to central it would be an improvement for us, but that's never going to happen. It's time to get realistic, their timetable for infrastructure is bleak, we have to get them to change it. Either speed it up or work into adding some east locations that aren't just in Florida.\n\nI understand their tech isn't ready to select regions, while actively logged in, which is *why we have to have our own server*. It's why the same damn reason there is three separate mega servers in Latin American. ***We need a very good why.*** We don't need an exact date, but this wishy washy, \"Oh we might look at adding an NA East server,\" isn't going to cut it! Hell it's not even at that point yet, they're still hiding behind their mask with the central server bullcrap.\n\nWhat it looks like to me is that the West coast server isn't going anywhere.

I think and hope that you're beginning to understand better your rights and missteps, as I think it was another Rioter 'Pwyff' has fairly asserted that your design philosophies and capacity for growth is proceeding exponentially.\n\nHowever, without going so far as to say this is a smokescreen, I don't know if this article - especially point #3 - could function as an excuse given that you, Riot, have the breadth of financial reach most game companies could only dream of. Many here are citing sources related to claims about new server materials and technologies recently purchased; you have given a half-hearted 'working-on-it' response for the better of three years without even alluding to generalities of fixing  ping; but what I'm most shocked about, is, again, that here we are and you haven't given us anything greater than we're working on it, even when you admit to being short sighted in your responses on this issue.\n\nI have been with you, in some sense, since very early - season one. I've given you a lot of financial support because I generally believed in you, *even* when it was hard for me to come back to this game. As it is, as shocked and disappointed as I am right now with so much invested, I'm not doing it anymore. All I can do is vote with my wallet and you're not getting anything until I have a stable, reliable ping that is consistently lower than 50.\n\nIt goes without saying you have competition: Smite, Dawngate, DOTA2, Heroes of the Storm and other new and upcoming MOBA-esque games. Sure, none of these are quite as big as you or have the resources that you do, but it can change - if you continue down this path you will lose customers.\n\nSo, I guess it falls down to what and how you say whatever excuse you have planned next. I'm not in PR, but it seems wise to start thinking of - at least - general and semi-specific discursive methods for improving ping  for your customers. \n\n**TL'DR:** **Congrats on Worlds, hoping for improvements and more events in the future, but I'm very discouraged by the last few attempts to explain the same thing with just different words.

I don't understand how that's acceptable. I started playing League because of how different Riot seemed to be - you know, constantly balancing, patching, and changing things that were wrong with the game. And while I commend them for that, since so few game developers provide support like Riot does (I come from playing mostly Call of Duty, so you can imagine what a 180 change it is to have a developer actually care about game balance), I can't help but still be very upset about this. I'm more concerned with being able to play the game than whether it is perfectly balanced. \n\nI was curious as to how much ping made a difference, so I tried the LAN server that everyone claims is \"basically NA East\"  and I was amazed to have a consistent 37 ping. It is truly a night and day difference when it comes to dodging skill shots, last hitting, and generally playing the game. So naturally, when I saw this post, I was super excited. But again, it's just more empty words and open-ended promises like the players have been told before I was even playing this game. I can't help but feel like Riot really couldn't care less about East Coast players. I'm tempted to switch to the LAN servers, but I refuse purely because doing so would cost money. I don't want Riot profiting off of my being forced to switch servers JUST TO PLAY THEIR GAME IN THE FIRST PLACE. I really think that Riot should offer free transfers to LAN, at least for a short time. Doing so would make this game playable for many players like me, who want to play, yet are finding it hard to do so, and would just be a gesture of good will, to show us that East Coast players matter to them. I'd love to continue playing this game, but it's very hard to do so when you are disconnecting every game, have huge ping spikes, fps drops, and have very little confidence that you'll even be able to play in the first place.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SpartanStallion","date":"2014-10-08T21:27:22.732+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wait, did I really understood you are talking about Eastern US server since a few years and you haven't figure has much as a location so far?","replies":[]}]}
