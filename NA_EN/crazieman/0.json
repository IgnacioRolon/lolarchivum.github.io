The cursor is TINY, and much of the interface is too small, especially the launch screen.\r\n\r\nIf there's a fix, I can't find it, I've hunted through the settings. If not, please give us an option. 4K is spreading and if there's no option, you guys are way behind. :(","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-07-24T17:57:08.574+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Full 4K support is definitely something we're looking into, but don't currently have a full offering for. At the moment, some items in League scale well with 4K, however, the User Interface and cursor currently don't. Running your in-game resolution at **1920x1080** and selecting **Fullscreen** should serve as a workaround for now, but keep in mind if you *Alt+Tab* out of the game at any point during a match, your UI and mouse may rescale to 4K and look tiny again. \n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[{"poster":"PakHin","date":"2016-07-25T06:13:20.722+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"But when is it gonna be fix tho? It is trurly frustrating because i just bought a gaming computer with a 4k screen without knowing that the game i actually play the most doesnt support 4k. And i also think this must be sorted quickly as 4k monitors are getting more and more widespread and i can see that a lot of people have the same problem like me as i surf through the internet to try to find the cure for the problem. I sincerely hope that riot can fix it and it will make a lot of peoples' lives easier.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Devil 995","date":"2016-07-25T10:23:03.130+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Btw a quick way of getting the cursor to rescale without having to quit game is to enable color blind mode and disable it again. That makes the cursor rescale again if i Alt+Tab out of the game","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TheDarkFighterz","date":"2016-07-24T16:11:12.491+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What exactly do you mean?
