It has been doing this for close to 15 hours. I've had it installing over night and over a 7 hour school day. If there is any fix to this please help as soon as possible I will try anything at this point.. I really would love to play once again and I'm scared I won't be able to.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-30T03:00:22.831+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"This specific issue happens if your connection to the Patching Servers is unstable, causing the patcher to miss files in the download process.

Huh, so why is it I just reinstalled csgo in under 20 minutes? Ever since patch 6.20 this game has been going downhill, very unstable, and you guys try to blame it on the consumers internet, that's laughable, I used to have 220 fps and 32 ping every game, after patch 6.20 I get 60 fps max and 49 ping, but hey, must be my internet, the one thing that's been a constant and hasn't been changed, not the game right? Been sitting at 58% \"applying patches\" for over 6 hours, this isn't my internet, it's the crappy client.","replies":[{"poster":"Heavenlegend1","date":"2016-12-01T00:01:16.686+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yikes is this guy not reliable orrrrr what's going on ? @SkankHunt","replies":[{"poster":"Lélóuch","date":"2016-12-01T01:56:42.275+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, TargonBlade is the most unreliable person on these forums. He once commented on a forum while ranked issues were going on (Note they had a bulletin up saying): \"We are aware of some inconveniences in ranked and are working to fix them\" Meaning riot acknowledged it was on them, and a kid complained about being booted mid game and Targon blamed it on his internet, while there was known server issues going on. Point being, I'm having the same exact issue and nothing in my internet service has changed, he's completely unreliable and honestly doesn't seem to have a clue 99% of the time.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Heavenlegend1","date":"2016-12-01T00:00:32.369+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"I re-did step 2/2 installation and this time it's been on 63% for a long time again applying patches and I've never had this problem before when installing league.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-01T00:25:08.845+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm glad to hear you've never had this problem before, but I'd like you to let me know how those connection guide steps went for you.","replies":[{"poster":"Heavenlegend1","date":"2016-12-01T18:54:50.753+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The only symptom I'm having is \"cannot patch game\" none of the others were a concern.
