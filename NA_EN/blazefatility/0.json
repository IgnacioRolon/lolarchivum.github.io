Now you must know how the leaverbuster system works, the LeaverBuster activates when a player is afk(away from keyboard) or when a player quits a match. As seen in the Buster's 'description' it says \"being afk or disconnecting from games is a punishable offence in League of Legends.\" it also says \"You have been placed in a lower priority queue due to your actions.\" which makes you wait X amount of minutes, and it puts you in that queue for 5 matches once 5 the matches have been completed you will no longer be in the lower priority queue. If you didn't get what i said here is a simplified one (hopefully you understand this one) You will be placed in a lower priority queue for being afk or disconnecting a match, and you will need to wait X amount of minutes so that you can join the matchmaking queue and you will spend 5 matches in the lower priority queue. Once the 5 matches have been completed will you no longer be in the lower priority queue. Now here is the thing, it said that you MUST play 5 games in match making games including custom games to get rid of your leaver buster. So what you do it create a custom match get ONE friend in the game play for about 7-10 minute tell you buddy to surrender and this message MIGHT pop up \"you have 4 matchmaking games in the lower priority queue.","replies":[{"poster":"Elric2k","date":"2017-01-02T07:40:03.215+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"This system is **not accurate** enough for all the players who leave a match while it is in progress.
