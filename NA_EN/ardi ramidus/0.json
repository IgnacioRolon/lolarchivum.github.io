Recently, when I get into game, League hides the box on the top left where the music is playing and True Colors does not work. When I minimize out of the in game client, True colors is working.

Anytime you click on the game it's going to force league towards the top.\n\nOn the subject of True Colors, sadly it's just not compatible with most games just yet, including League. The number of color combinations is a bit too high for a lot of games to be able to handle while transitioning between so many colors so quickly.","replies":[{"poster":"Ardi Ramidus","date":"2017-06-17T03:52:54.189+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for such a quick response.
