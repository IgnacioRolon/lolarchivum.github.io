Fact is, most people do neither. The reason is because in the heat of the game it is very hard to think logically and people often react without thinking things through.\n\nThis issue is identical to one I faced when I was a camp counselor for second graders many years ago. There was a bully who would pick on the other kids and they always REACTED without thinking; they first tried to retaliate and then began crying. So I devised a system for them and it crushed the bully. It worked so well; I figured let's try it on League.\n\n**The Vegetable System**\n\nWhat to do: When someone rages, is toxic, or rude towards you simply reply with a vegetable. For example: \"WTF man, why did you call bot lane if you suck at ADC so bad??\" You respond: \"Avocado\" or \"Carrots\".\n\nWhat it does: \n\nA. Instead of feeling beat-down you feel smug \nB. Toxic person will very quickly learn that he is getting no where and will give up. \n\nRetaliation is necessary sometimes. It is very hard to focus and play well or even enjoy them game when your ego has taken a beating. This is the most passive form of retaliation; you aren't saying ANYTHING negative about the other player yet you feel good that you have said your piece. \n\nThis might seem very weird but I encourage you to try it. Next time you meet a toxic player in game try the **Vegetable System**.","replies":[{"poster":"Carrotz","date":"2015-04-22T17:17:24.422+0000","up_votes":57,"down_votes":0,"body":"But then I'll think your calling me all game and it might throw me off my game!","replies":[]},{"poster":"ResponsibleDad","date":"2015-04-22T13:10:54.063+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a responsible dad I can tell you that such systems do indeed work.","replies":[{"poster":"BeatzBoyFTW","date":"2015-04-22T13:48:28.059+0000","up_votes":26,"down_votes":1,"body":"Dad: Son, can you tell me how can you be this stupid to get a 30 out of 100 in English?\nSon: Banana\nDad: Son, dont play around with me....\nSon: Apple\n\nSeems like it's working alrite :3","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Hylia","date":"2015-04-22T17:33:14.819+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"imagine  doing this playing as Order of the Banana Soraka omg","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vistha Kai","date":"2015-04-27T01:20:16.930+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I read it as \"Sona\"... then I saw \"Dad\". :|","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"9baksQuJhb","date":"2015-04-22T13:31:06.803+0000","up_votes":24,"down_votes":1,"body":"Why not fruit? {{champion:16}}","replies":[{"poster":"EvilMerodach","date":"2015-04-25T08:43:00.877+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=KimJongUlt,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=EOBKEEOY,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-04-22T13:31:06.803+0000)\n>\n> Why not fruit? {{champion:16}}\n\n..no one expects it.

In order for the ones that were misbehaving to understand what they were doing wrong, in most cases you could not simply say a random word that was off-topic to divert their attention or confuse them. Both years when i was there, there were a few kids that didn't want to follow the rules. Those people wanted attention, and acknowledging that they were disturbing people is what made them happy. What worked best to deal with these people was first to tell the other students to ignore the instigator, and if he/she persists, then a punishment is to follow. \n\nI believe it's similar in league. We're not dealing with second graders that have a much lower cognitive base, we're dealing people that, for the most part, are our age. Someone that is spamming chat and/or throwing death threats to other players is not going to stop once you respond because you're giving them acknowledgement, even if it doesn't pertain to what the person is saying.\n\nYou also make the argument about \"not thinking logically\" while in this sort of situation. If the person has already said enough to throw you off-game, then you've waited too long to utilize the mute button and chances are they won't think logically of another way to handle it. Muting a player is faster than typing a response, and doesn't draw you into the problem. \n\nThe best way to deal with people that are truly a problem is to mute them and play the game as you would otherwise. Then you can report them after the game. Don't waste time responding to someone, even if it's just one word. Most of these people are hoping to get some sort of reaction out of you, and no matter how you view it, they will think that they're getting to you.","replies":[{"poster":"r11na","date":"2015-04-23T00:24:23.427+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"> We're not dealing with second graders that have a much lower cognitive base\n\nAre you sure about that?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Linthe","date":"2015-04-22T17:24:34.765+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Funny, I agree.

They attack what they perceive to be a weak point, and they don't expect you to have the gumption react in a way which is meaningful to them. Even if you say nothing, their work is done. They said what they wanted to say, and they think you're weaker for it. Your retaliation or self-defense enhances this feeling even more. Unless you can find a weak point to attack as well (which can break the TOS of this game, as well as be difficult to find if you're not a predatory individual like they are,) saying something completely random is the most effective route to throw them off.
