You HAVE the tools to an AMA here now, so why are none of the big ones happening here?","replies":[{"poster":"Zakennayo","date":"2014-12-11T18:28:45.501+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Cause these new boards suck major floppy donkey dick..\n\nAnd even Riot doesn't want to touch it..","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"midorii","date":"2014-12-11T16:13:04.326+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"This is silly.\nThey've been pretty active, check the red tracker yo","replies":[{"poster":"Jeddy017","date":"2014-12-11T16:31:02.724+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I guess he wants specific Riot activity or something.Or he wants a rioter to appear in a number of hot threads.\n\nI don't know.There clearly IS interaction happening.Whether it's the type he wants or not,IDK.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kobold","date":"2014-12-11T16:34:00.595+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Compared to pre-boards, no.

The same logic could be used if you accidentally shoot yourself in the hand with a nail gun; \"Hey, at least it's only one hand with a nail in it, Jesus had two.\"  \n\nThe thing is; the logic \"it could be worse\" is a horrible way to look at life.  It can always be worse but conversely it can always be better.  This fact makes this type of logic equivalent to saying; \"look here we are.\"  It also comes with it though an certain amount of implied fear of change or pessimism.  \"here we are but don't move because if you do it'll get worse.\"  \n\nIt does happen that trying to change something for the better has made it worse but it is a rare occurrence.  Usually if you work towards something better you achieve something better.  In this case the OP is putting time in to try and build a better level of communication with the reds.  I was adding a bit of time to work towards that end too because I think it's a good goal.  You actually put your time in opposition to that and told riot you are happy with this current level of interaction.  You even went so far as to say you are more afraid any change will be bad so pls do Not change at all.  \n\nNow there is logic in comparing two separate regions.  It is relate-able information and has value.  I would ask the question; Are those the only two? and if not how is the dev interaction on the other ones?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Sneak Dog","date":"2014-12-11T18:40:04.654+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bug report/balance are doing fine as far as I know. The whole story board is getting pretty much nothing from Riot despite them announcing retconning the very premise of the lore. Shouldn't such a change be heavily discussed by Riot too? The community sure did. \n\nHeck, right now they're not only retconning the IoW but also whatever else they don't like, like Xerath (and Trundle, he too is part of this new lore). But all posts from narrative are just moving on and plainly accepting the retconning of not only the premise of the lore but also the characters. They're some neat details about Azir and such.\n\nHowever, for me from EUW, there's now a chance of a relevant Rioter reading my post, so that's nice.","replies":[]},{"poster":"alaskaneagle","date":"2014-12-11T21:43:39.704+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"54367\n\nseems to me they cut red post to player interaction by close to 70%.
