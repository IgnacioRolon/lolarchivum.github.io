Well, now I have:\n\nIt actually SUCKS. I hate it. There is no point on lanes at all with tower so close. Every time I played a melee hero I lost lane. EVERY TIME. There is no room to walk up and farm. If the lane gets pushed SLIGHTLY then you are farming under tower.\n\nAnd btw, the towers have diff attack then usual so if you are normally good at CSing under tower.. well this is different.\n\nAnyhow, I LOVED the old TT; it was my fav mode. I hate the new one with a passion. Why couldn&#039;t they just update the units. :(\n\nRIOT I know you hate admitting you were wrong, but if you see TT numbers DROP in the future, not rise would you revert back? Cause I'm not playing it anymore...","replies":[{"poster":"Xings","date":"2015-06-11T23:56:04.522+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like it, TT is my favorite and really like the new map. ;) {{champion:111}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ravenhale","date":"2015-06-17T15:48:33.805+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have only played this map against the AI. I must say with the additional tower that this is easily the hardest Bot setting available. As noted by other posters, there simply is no room to farm. Even a ranged champion gets pushed back to tower with minimal effort from the aggressive AI which always runs Mage/Marksmen/Fighter(Tank). If your team goes two melee you end up in a quick hole. Haven't lost to the AI yet, but I have had some serious scares when I'm paired up with two assassins.\n\nFor PVP, I would not dare do this map blind pick. I would guess the best setup would be AP Carry (mid), AD Carry (bot) and either run Support with the ADC or risk a Jungler. I don't see how any Top Lane champs have a fair shake on this map. Sure the AI does it, but that Warwick is usually the easiest one to pick off.","replies":[]},{"poster":"poodoo","date":"2015-06-12T05:03:18.656+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Totally agree with original poster.
