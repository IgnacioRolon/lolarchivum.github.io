Problem is, if Lee is even remotely competent, he is very un-fun to play against. Because his kit is so loaded, he has all the chances to outplay you while you have very little to outplay him. With Lee, it's either fighting on his terms or not fighting at all. He wants to fight? Have fun escaping 2 gap-closers, a slow and one of highest MS in game. He doesn't want to fight? Again, 2 mobility spells and a 1200-unit knockback.\n\nMain problem with him is that he has no real weaknesses. His kit is overall filled with utility and deals very high damage (340 + 1.8 AD + HP scaling on a basic ability and an execution grade damage on his hard-CC ult). By no means I want Lee destroyed. I want him to be more fair to play against while still being fun and rewarding to play as.\n\nI think best changes would be: Lowering his ability damage and increasing their energy cost, while in turn buffing his passive. He now actually has to utilize his passive instead of it just being another damage ability and weave AA's in-between spells.

Now, how can you interpret this?  I see a few ways.\n\n1)  Lee Sin is a strong champion played by people who suck, despite those people being Diamond, Master, or Challenger.\n\n2)  Lee Sin is a strong champion played by strong players whose teammates happen to suck more than usual.\n\n3)  Lee Sin is a strong champion played by good players who doesn't fit well into most team comps, causing the team as a whole to lose.\n\n4)  Lee Sin is a weak champion despite all the hype and is popular for different reasons.\n\nI would be more inclined to pick #4.  He isn't that great of a champion.  So why do we see so much of him?  Because he's fun to play, hard to counter, and fits well into virtually any team comp.  But across all game modes, at high levels of play, Lee loses more games than he wins.  That might be correlation if we weren't talking about millions of games, but we are.  With a sample that large, there has to be a causative element as well.  And if you disagree, then explain the numbers to me.\n\nRemember, the professional players represent the tiniest, tiniest minority of the League playerbase.  While some nerfs are made to shake up the competitive scene (Hi LeBlanc) do we really think nerfing Lee won't just get him replaced by someone else that we'll proceed to see every game?","replies":[{"poster":"Balderdash1000","date":"2015-01-29T18:04:59.618+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Interesting points, but let's look at point one in a slightly different angle.

My personal speculation would be that he's a lot like the old Nidalee - When she was dominating a game it was the most frustrating thing in the world because there was absolutely nothing you could do due to a high-damage high-mobility kit with escapes out the ass.  You really *felt* it when Nidalee was in control of the game and you remembered those games for a very long time, forgetting all the mediocre ones that happened in the interim.  Lee, I think, has the same sort of thing going for him - You don't really notice the bad ones, but you really notice the good ones that make you want to smash your face into your desk until you swallow your own teeth.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"SionideCN","date":"2015-01-29T14:38:18.093+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":11,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Hinro Honato,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=G71fIm0z,comment-id=000100000000,timestamp=2015-01-29T14:29:54.698+0000)\n>\n> Fair enough on the first point.

His early game damage is incredible and he doesn't fall off hard enough late game to pay for it. If you think Lee falls off late game, I suggest you take a look at his ratios to convince yourself otherwise.\n\n2. Lee's mobility makes him feel cheap to play against because ward dashes and Qs to jungle creeps make him impossible to punish. As a result, not only does he have an incredible early, but he's very safe while being able to easily kill you. He's a low risk, high reward pick.\n\n3. He is such a consistently strong jungler that he serves as a litmus test for other junglers. The reason junglers like Nautilus/Sejuani/Amumu are not viable is because if Lee Sin invades them, there is no way they can possibly fight him. His ganks and clearing are both so good that every jungler must answer the question \"why play X when you could just pick Lee\" just to get on the field.\n\nAll of these factors come together to ensure that Lee is almost always one of the strongest picks in League of Legends. He has been viable or top tier in every single meta game since his release.

All that frustration of seeing lanes lost because of level 2 Lee Sin ganks; all the restriction of being unable to play half the potential junglers because a Lee Sin invade would cripple us for the rest of the game; all the times Lee made a mistake that would have killed any other champion in the game, then proceeds to kick->ward jump out. \n\nWe're tired of it.","replies":[{"poster":"Wullf","date":"2015-01-29T16:26:39.453+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The way I see it he is accidentally pretty well balanced champion.

It is probably very true that many of the pros play Lee Sin because they find him fun to play, but it is also very true that Lee Sin DOES grant an advantage to the team he is on simply because his kit is truly quite overpowered.  His kit has too much in it.\n\nIt has utility, mobility, damage (there is this myth that his damage falls off lategame....this actually isn't entirely true, he still does a ton of damage lategame, it just isn't quite as ridiculous as the amount of damage he does in the earlygame), Sustain, Hard CC, disengage, engage......etc.\n\nLee Sin can peel, tank, splitpush, assassinate, and even waveclear.  There isn't a role in the game that Lee Sin cannot fulfill, and that is a huge problem.\n\nI do truly feel that because of that, he deserves some nerfing to make him more in line with the others","replies":[]},{"poster":"Retillin","date":"2015-01-29T17:04:18.755+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well here is the thing. \n\nThere are different ideas/versions of \"OP\". Some say Thresh is because as a support he just has so many tools that he's NEVER a bad pick. Jax (before his nerfs) was OP because his numbers were too high for everything he brought to the table. Gnar/Rek'sai are the same thing right now (as Jax was). Janna mid was OP not because she beat anyone, but because she couldn't be beaten in lane. She just pushed the wave into tower and backed off. 0 counter-play. Zed due to instata death at some points.\n\nWhat makes Lee Sin \"OP\" is a bit tricky. \nHis base numbers are high (they are, his level 3 is amazing). He has twice the number of abilities than almost anyone before level 6, this means that his BURST is really high. \nHis mobility is one of, if not the, best in the game. Yes he doesn't have a flash and needs a ward/ally or enemy to move but the cooldowns are really low and the cost are also low. \nHis ult is the most under-rated part of his kit. I'm not talking \"big plays lcs\", but his ability to disengage whole team fights on a 60 second cooldown counters a LOT of champion ult engages. \nHe doesn't have a \"weakness\". Rengar, a pink ward really hurts him. Jarvan, doesn't have a way out of a team fight (yes he's really strong right now but that is mostly by numbers), Elise does everything Lee does, but weaker. Amumu/Naut/Sej/tank junlgers, can't handle 1v1 jungle fighting vs him. Ect...\n\n\nSo really the problem is his KIT is wrong. He needs a rework to become balanced. Right now, he has so many tools that he is always one of (for 3 years now) the best jungler, or IS the best jungler. I think there was 1.2 million ranked games played by him in the last month. (only after Thresh's 1.4 mil) In Diamond ranked he was still picked more than Jarven. And J4 has a higher win rate.

I understand that these factor into the champion and their balance, but this is a team game. All we see is that he wins less than half the games he is chosen. We don't see the actual results of the games themselves. For all we know the lee sin could have had amazing scores but still lost. And Vice Versa could be said. So, if we are to take a look at the champion itself, I agree with everyone that he isn't necessarily OP. He could use some changes, whether it be nerfs or a rework or even little ability changes.

I don't care if he is OP or UP right now, but he is just un-fun to play against and has a super binary hard carry or bust play style. He has surprisingly similar issues to Poppy. Both are super binary, both are really fun to play and satisfying to play well (I LOVE playing Poppy), both have extreme kit balance (For Lee, he is really strong early, falls off hard late, and vice versa for Poppy who is weak early but hyper carries late). Regardless of whether he is strong right now, he makes the game feel like trash if playing against one with half a brain (however, he is at that terrible spot where he can also just as likely be completely useless). Right now, his kit is at the point where it can't get buffed or he is instantly OP again, but it is already super weak. Basically, Riot has to Olaf him until they get the balls to finally rework his kit, because he will keep flip flopping between super OP or incredibly useless, and will keep being anti-fun until they put him down.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Moe Moe Kyuun","date":"2015-01-29T18:52:33.718+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Using winrates is horrible.

People laugh at the notion that he falls off hard in the end, but he seriously does. By the time end game comes, his only advantage on the field of battle is his hyper mobility. I don't know a single jungler who falls off harder then Lee Sin by mid-late to late game.

He looks and feels powerful, but he's quite balanced outside of a few minor issues.
