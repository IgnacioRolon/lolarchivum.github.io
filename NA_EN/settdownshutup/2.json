You blew it up! Ahhhh, damn you! God damn you all to hell!\"\n\nEDIT:\n\nOkay, I've spent the majority of the day testing and playing.  My end results? ....\n\nHe's amazing, he deals incredible damage, will likely be nerfed on his W **AND** Q.   And he is by far the worst remake I've seen riot pop out in a while.\n\n_\"Hey!\"_ I hear you say, _\"How can he be the worst remake if his damage is so incredible!\"_\n\n...Because he's not fun, and he's not Mordekaiser.  I fancied Kaiser as a top lane lone wolf that simply kept to himself as he farmed wave after wave.  If you attempted to gank him, he had one option.  Fight for his **LIFE**.  And that's something you don't see in any other champion.  There's always some way to play well and escape, always some way to prolong the end result in hopes of assistance or for the enemies to call off the chase.  Mordekaiser HAD to stand his ground, and oftentimes won because of that instance of shock when the Jungler realizes, this isn't a chase.  It's a death-match and I just locked my own cage by blowing my gap closers early.  All those valued slows don't mean a thing if he isn't turning tail, and now you've blown them on him and he has 8 seconds to PUMMEL YOU before you can even think of escape.\n\nWhen Mordekaiser walked and I mean WALKED down to mid, it was an event.  Often it isn't worth it during the laning phase so you don't see him at first.  \"Oh, it's a Mordekaiser. Guess I'll CC him and walk away.\"  But when the team fights start happening? Oh boy.  \"Oh **GOD** it's Mordekaiser! My soul, he's bludgeoning me with my own soul!\"  He was a champion that my skype pals would joke \"Arrives fashionably late\", because of how slow he was but how influential his mere presence is.  \n\nSo rounding back to why I think this is a horrible Remake?  Riot I hope you know already because if the entirety of the forums hasn't hinted it at you already, what hope do I have?  \n\nMordekaiser is now a confused pile of stats, skills and requirements.\n\nLook at the suggested item list, I mean just LOOK at it.  I remember some rioter mentioning these were the items that the play-testers most bought.  But was this actually a good thing for the common player?   It's a bloody mess!  There's barely any coherency, and this also affects the skills impeding their potential.\n\nMace of Spades I could argue was Mordekaiser's least memorable skill, and I loved it.  There is, was, such a wonderful feeling of seeing a person run away from their own minion in terror as the AOE hammers spun towards them, slow enough that I could watch from the safety of the enemy creep cloud with satisfaction.  Now it's amazing, but if the goal was to make a healthier ability for him... Well, people are already crunching the numbers and it isn't looking... *Smacks a Mundo for 3/4 his health* ... Good.\n\nHarvester of Sorrow prior to this patch wasn't by most definitions 'strong' but it was much needed shield generation to lane.  Some people even liked to max it first in order to play \"Will it Blend\" with the opposing team.  (Yes, it will.)\nThe new W needs a solo ability, SOMETHING.   Even if it's just that burst of healing from it's ally effect.  It needs it, and it doesn't feel good.  I couldn't get a single game where a teammate was willing to play nice with it, and to me it's telling of what Solo Q experience will be.  **And I swear to god if one more player asks if I'm support I will UNINSTALL. ARGH!**\n\nYou've gone and nerfed Siphon of Destruction, and it was likely needed.  But I can feel it under my fingertips, it's mechanically nerfed as well.  I used to be able to time my Es perfectly, hitting a flashing enemy the instance he wastes it.  Now he gets away scott free, and that makes me a sad Morde.  The shielding is almost insulting, and as an aside Morde's passive doesn't even gain half as much as it used to, making him squishier than a Leblank on cooldown.\n\nThe dragon. Hm, I can only assume the excitement the dev team had coming up with this one.  I honestly agree, it's a fun concept, but let me say this.  I would gladly give up whatever portion of the 'budget' you deemed this ability was worth.  **This is my personal opinion and should NOT be taken as gospel, nor any of this essay.**  He's currently clunky, feels slow and more importantly, Mordekaiser minions are prioritized first by my W.  I've had teammates die because of this and you feel like shit afterward.   And if that dragon is going to be so slow, and have a ranged attack, at least make his W circle a smidgen bigger.  He can be within HIS attack range of a target, while I'm beating on the same target, and the W circles won't be in range.  It's just clunky.  \n\n\nThe rest I've said already.  Why Mordekaiser? Why not a different champion?  Why so drastic the changes?  Why 'screw the thematics' with Mordekaiser's requirement of a buddy ally? Why the confusing addition of AD ratios? Why not have better AP and keep the potential for Magekaiser?  \n\nWhy?","replies":[{"poster":"BattleBalladeer","date":"2015-08-20T15:31:59.328+0000","up_votes":37,"down_votes":2,"body":"This is so beautiful {{champion:82}} {{item:3070}} \n\n\nNEVER FORGET!\n02/24/2010 - 08/20/15\nhttp://i.imgur.com/zI6ejmE.jpg\n\n\"Ele era o nÃºmero um.\" (He was number one.)","replies":[{"poster":"Remlap1223","date":"2015-08-20T17:46:57.562+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Smitty sends his regards.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"JedenVojak","date":"2015-08-20T07:24:47.033+0000","up_votes":24,"down_votes":5,"body":"This is funny, but I wonder if young people nowadays would even get the reference.\n\nEdit: Apparently it's prolific enough that I need not have concerned myself.

Because that's what they do. Every time the Meta shifts they do another balance pass across the champ pool. It's a lot of unnecessary work that wouldn't be needed if the roster was balanced amongst itself and they let the playerbase come up with strategies to defeat the current meta.

Who knows, maybe some changes to the duo lane might have eventually happened on their own if they'd made more subtle and open-ended changes.\n\nMaybe if ADC=hypercarry, mages=race-to-16 weren't such an entrenched thing, then ADC in duo lane wouldn't be so entrenched either.  But it would probably take a major overhaul of itemization to make that happen, and they've sort of chosen the road that they're on to the extent that it takes this bullshit Morde passive or an overtuned Targon's Brace to challenge it now.

They've tuned the game in such a way over all these years that only radical champion rebuilds ever manage to do anything noticeable, and I think that's their intended goal. Whenever a champion finds its way into a lane or role they didn't intentionally design to be possible or viable, they throw the hammer at it until it's back in line where they think it's supposed to be. The other problem is the design that \"all champions should scale with items\" which ended up meaning \"all champions can't perform without items\". When everyone on the team is fighting for gold, there's never enough to go around.\n\nI hate to bring out the name \"Dota\" in these parts, but from a roster and role perspective they've got the balance down much better. Yes, the game has its own problems, but I'm speaking strictly on a kit and role balance that allows different lane placements. These changing placements without changing the role of the hero allow different teams to thrive in different metas, which encourages a player-driven meta cycle that changes based on needs. 5-man teamfights too strong? Build a siege comp with anti-engage and win that way. Enemy has low mobility? Time to split-push to victory.\n\nRiot doesn't want that though. They think it's boring to watch, and viewer entertainment value is what they appear to value the most. So while those other strategies can \"work\", they're always going to be less effective than full on team-fights that can get the crowd excited.\n\nI always found it interesting that they liked to claim that if a strategy gets adopted by the entire pro league, then it must be too strong... yet they never applied that thinking to curb metas where 5v5 teamfighting was the only way to win.

All I see is them waving around this \"Flag of Diversity and Choice\" while they remove choice from players that doesn't fit their grand vision of the game. If it were a broken choice or a false choice that'd be one thing, but it's completely another when it's just hypocritical \"you can only have choice when we deem it acceptable by current meta standards\".\n\nSupports building AP items and going mid? Can't do that, so let's cut their AP ratios and pretend they can still buy the items without being \"too strong\".  Oh, Supports don't have any reason to buy AP items now? Guess we'll give them some scaling on their support aspects even though they never needed it. Not like it matters, since the support is the only role not swimming in gold anyway but let's just sweep that one under the rug. The \"jungler item\" is being bought by laners? Better nerf or put jungle-only requirements on it so they stop doing that, since it gets in the way of their Infinity Edges or Black Cleavers they should have been buying instead.\n\nI started right between Xin and Vlad's release, but I still play this game because it can manage to be entertaining IN SPITE of the developers constant battle with understanding their own game and genre.

Rageblade's questionable viability aside, true hybridization of damage is something they've been striving to remove from many of the newer champions and I'm convinced the only reason it's still a thing at all is because the older champion pool that utilized it is being grandfathered in so people can still feel like they can build what they want. Even Darius, with his latest pass, got his bleed converted into physical damage.\n\nPart of this is that I think Riot thinks their playerbase isn't smart enough to read death recaps or do a small amount of research into what damage type a certain champion favors. They want players to be able to see the guy with the giant axe swinging around and think \"oh, hey, I should be building armor!\". I'm sure this is their major problem with Morde considering he falls into the problem of being a legacy champion that doesn't follow new-age identifiers. I shudder to think what they'd do to Dazzle if they got ahold of him (for those unaware, he's one of Dota's supports where all his spells do physical damage and has an armor reduction ultimate, allowing him to build as a ranged \"carry\" sometimes for fun). I'm sure this issue is why, from what I've been reading, Morde is finding more success in building like an AD bruiser instead of his old AP bruiser identity. I wouldn't be surprised if Morde is slowly converted to this model, assuming he doesn't get a true rework instead.\n\nBut yes, it seems Riot actually doesn't like build diversity despite saying they do.

There's a variety of champions without escape or hard CC, again Mordekaiser is hardly unique in this aspect.\n\nPre-rework Fiora, Darius, Rumble, Yorick and then there's a bunch of champions who have no escape but have  CC that's incredibly unlikely to save them against a competent gank like Viktor, Pantheon, Nasus ect.\n\nAgain, Mordekaiser is hardly unique amongst the wide variety of champions who get completely dicked by ganks. Also, the fact that Mordekaisers almost universally take flash makes the option to fight or flight always present if Flash is up.

I'd forfeit that yes, he definitely can have the Mordekaiser mindset.\nRumble has both a slowing projectile that he can cast twice and and a shielding MS boost, AND his ultimate that slows.\nYorick, Fuck Yorick.  He has a pokemon that slows and one that also gives him bonus MS.  And while you're attempting to chase him let's give him some health back while we're at it.\n\nYes, they CAN be dicked, any champion can be, but their skillsets give them options to run away.  \n\nAnd you're right,  Flash is Mordekaiser's one chance every 5 minutes at 'flight'.
