At level two i land a grab on him but. half way in my grab&#039;s trajectory he use his E (Arcane Shift) and get away. It happened that when a Blitz land his grab at the same time he Arcane shift it still work, the point is that He used his Arcane Shift once he had already been grabbed half of the trajectory.\r\n\r\nIt happened all game long everytime i landed a grab he was still able to use his E. Even my friends that were on skype with me found that quite stupid. He survived all the time cause of it.","replies":[{"poster":"Shikigami","date":"2016-10-07T22:28:43.505+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's the mechanic, it's been like this since his release. It's why his mobility is so strong..because you can't cancel it (Unlike Lucian who can get stopped mid-ability).","replies":[{"poster":"LordySerge","date":"2016-10-08T06:51:57.934+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"no it is a bug. as i said to the other guy, he used his E not when he got grabbed. but when he was already grabbed and he was already mid-way in the grab","replies":[{"poster":"Shikigami","date":"2016-10-08T21:23:34.932+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It has a channel, when the duration ends the E applies.

Grab is a CC there shouldnt be anything castable while being Grabbed it's truly idiot -.- and to cast the spell when he has already been grabbed half-way to me. there's the limit of understanding the point WHEN I GRAB and WHEN HE IS MID-GRABBED","replies":[{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2016-10-09T20:45:20.654+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> to cast the spell when he has already been grabbed half-way to me. \n\nHe's not. He's pressing E before he's grabbed. It just takes that long to actually go off.\n\nThe closest thing to this being \"fixed\" is making it so Ezreal's blink doesn't have a delay at the start, but you wouldn't catch Ezreal's that are avoiding you this anyway because they have the reactions to blink away before the fist would have hit.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"AidanWR","date":"2016-10-07T23:45:39.968+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Question: Did Ez move from the spot that you grabbed him?
