I restarted the client and it shows the button to reconnect. I push it, nothing happens. I have restarted computer and restarted client many times, still doing the same thing. It also shows I'm in game. I have ruined a game for 9 other people and it's not even something I did. I don't want to get reported for a client crash and then it not allowing me back into game.\n\n**UPDATE** It allowed me to reconnect in the post game lobby. I don't understand....\n***Update 2*** I attempted to make a bot game so that this wouldn't happen again. It was literally a custom with just me vs. a bot. I pick my champion, begin to load, then it crashes and does the same thing as previously stated. I have checked firewall and antivirus, nothing is blocking this. Please please help\n","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-10T23:00:53.194+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It really sounds like something is blocking your access to our servers, but only the actual game servers and not the client or lobby. Try updating your port forwarding with [**these steps**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664#wq8) to be sure those aren't closed, but also try running a clean boot to make sure nothing else is getting in the way.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Painlimit","date":"2018-01-10T17:46:54.939+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The exact same thing happened with me, trying to reinstall right now.","replies":[]}]}
