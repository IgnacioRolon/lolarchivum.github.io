There isn't anything you can do about it in game. If they for some reason decided to queue up just to ruin the experience for the 4 people unfortunate enough to get put on a team with them, there is nothing you can do about it. These games will happen, more often than some will admit, but you just need to accept that fact when you play League and hope that it balances out eventually.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Stephenizgod","date":"2016-03-12T21:29:39.015+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If I am in a good mood i will just talk positive no matter what they say, if i am not in a good mood I will listen to music and ignore any comment that isnt positive.

I think this is a proponent of low elo, at least I think its worse in low elo, its certainly everywhere.\n\nI also think the ranking system is a little screwed up at the moment, so players aren't where they should be in the ladder. I go into depth about this in another post I'm trying to get traction on. Its about reforming the system a bit in order to make performance count towards lp modifiers at the end of the game. The general idea to improve the accuracy of the ladder and give good players an out when their team feeds like crazy, but you still go 1/1/10 or something dumb. As a support main I run into this quite a bit.\n\nWe could use your input: [Improving the ranked ladder system](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/Gbg9mmEq-support-and-ranked)","replies":[{"poster":"Sex ba bob","date":"2016-03-12T00:28:30.455+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i got two account i play on average elo the thing is  i kinda have bad luck with immature teammates that just ruin it for most of the team and i always  try to hype my team to thinking we can do something instead of ranting and doing nothing","replies":[{"poster":"KazaJhodo","date":"2016-03-12T21:20:56.678+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I think a players attitude actually will correlate with their skill level.\n\nSo lower elo is plauged with this, although I still feel as though the skill levels in individual games are wildly rampant. Plus the safety nets that stop people from falling out of divisions really screw up the game. You end up with a pile of people in say silver 5, that belong in bronze 5.\n\nUltimately I think a lot of the problems that we're running into lately are because we're being matched poorly with other players.\n\nI'm trying to get some traction on a post I'm doing about it and what I think riot can do to fix it.

You'll experience a more positive environment in normals, where winning means less and having fun means more.\n\nSecondly, get used to muting your entire team and the entire enemy team every single game. I do this now, and it's incredible how less irritable I am after games. I don't wait for them to start being toxic, I take the initiative and mute them all immediately. That way I never see a single negative remark in the chat, and I can concentrate on my gameplay.\n\nThirdly, play only champions you enjoy playing. Ignore what the team \"needs\", ignore people who tell you to play certain things, and ignore everything people say about X champion being bad/useless. By playing only champions you like, there's less risk around stressing out over playing something you're uncomfortable with.\n\nLastly, listen to some chill music as you play. This may seem incredibly cliche, if not downright useless, but you'd be surprised at the effect music has on the human brain. Pop on some tunes you love, and all the negativity will be replaced by positive thoughts, and it will create a relaxing atmosphere perfect for enjoying the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Sex ba bob","date":"2016-03-11T22:23:25.593+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i do that but sometimes,but  i like to try stay on same page as my team and ask them if they need help or would need help and try to keep them with a positive attitude if they're feel like crap because they're doing bad i feel like playing a game just for myself is not the best way of being a team player i feel like you should be able to play a game without having to mute everyone its not much to ask for but it kind of is","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Very Hard Engage","date":"2016-03-11T22:09:40.167+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its only a game, you know more than they do, and just by consistently doing the things they dont do, you will rise above them and get to play even better games. ones that dont have them in particular.","replies":[]},{"poster":"OurLestrade","date":"2016-03-11T22:07:13.585+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Being on mic with a friend helps, as well as limiting how many PvP games you play a day.","replies":[]}]}
