The commercials on YT show more than enough. From the videos I saw-\r\n\r\n-An almost exact same base design\r\n-Gnar copy\r\n-Diana copy\r\n-Lucian copy\r\n-Wayyyy more hugs copies, these are just what I remember. I&#039;m sure you&#039;ve seen some commercials of how bs it is.\r\n\r\nCan Riot infringe them? Aren&#039;t their champs copyrighted? I&#039;d like to see some action taken against the patheticness of Moba Legends","replies":[]}
