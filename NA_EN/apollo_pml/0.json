From looking at it, it appears that you were identified as actively participating in fraud with League of Legends.  The content unlocked through this fraud was subsequently removed from your account, and any gifts sent to friends from this fraud were also removed.\n\nIf you would like more specific information about this, make sure to [submit a ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and we should be able to give further information about what occurred.","replies":[{"poster":"Apollo PML","date":"2014-12-02T06:13:28.477+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for taking the time to reply. I had a friend set me up with some \"cheap rp\" when I first started playing. I was later informed of it fraudulent nature but was told that is was a common practice. I recognize the legitimacy behind your claim and will not argue that point; I am in the wrong. However the missing items are recent purchases, purchased using rp and ip obtained through the official channel, that being the league client and payment via paypal through the client. Following the realization that \"cheap rp\" wasn't a encouraged practice; I have since made all my purchases through the correct channels and have invested a substantial amount of money, likely in excess of hundreds of dollars. If you could ensure that the legitimate purchases are honored and those which are not are repossessed I would be very appreciative. ---as i said this was done on my behalf as a new player, this does not excuse the act but I do hope you will recall those item purchased with said rp and ip and not those obtained through official means","replies":[{"poster":"Apollo PML","date":"2014-12-02T06:24:48.599+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To add to this, I appreciate all the riot does; league of leagues is by far my favorite game, all the hard work put into it really comes across and I'm sure there are many process of great importance which are too subtle to be noted. Like myself I'm sure many are effected by this and we should be, as you said we have all partaken in a fraudulent process. However I will be reluctant to purchase further digital goods unless instances like this are handled with more tact. The related purchases should be effectively reclaimed, not those which are easiest for the system to pick out. Again I recognize I am in the wrong and I say all this will a positive tone---- if this can be revisited I would be very appreciative, if this isn't resolved I can safely say I will not purchase further rp in fear of this happening again---all, if not most effected items were obtain through the correct channels, while those which should be reclaimed remain.

This is counter to what you have said. I understand you are not the help desk so not much can be done, I thank you for your efforts, you were able to provide temporary peace of mind. \n\nAs for riot. I love your work and all the it has brought us. I believe LOL has a huge future and will likely be a great success as long as e-sport remain. With all this said unless this is resolved in a more civil manner I will have to abstain on principal--- I recognize we are in the wrong but your older system allowed for this and many new player were told to do this by veterans without understanding the nature of the act.  As a new player the bad rp/ip was spent rashly; I'm sure like myself many player do not utilize the item purchased with this rp/ip, where as the good you reclaimed were purchased with intent and through your  system. \n\nI cannot speak for everyone but I have been an active user of your official rp system since recognizing the nature of the cheap rp. I have since spent hundreds of dollars, I'm sure based off the data it is clear I am an active spender---spending as much as 100+ some months---I surely would have blown close to $400+ between now and early next year, likely a lot more. I will be uninstalling today, i refuse to play without the items I purchased through you--- and I refuse to repurchase those item, some which I've had for less than a week. ---Its a sad day, one of my favorite pass times is dead to me. I truly hope you are able to resolve this, nothing would make me happier than to receive and NON auto generated reply to my ticket saying that the fraudulent purchases (mostly starting champ bundles so this should be easy) have been reclaimed and the tons of awesome and rare stuff I actually paid  you large sums of money for are back on my account . I gotta say I am in the middle of exams so I won't be pressing this further however I will be seeking legal aid in the following weeks---which is easy since I go to an amazing university. I do not wish to start trouble, and I likely follow this path only for my own reference; I feel  am largely uninformed on my rights and yours. I don't imagine you will hear from me again so thank you for the awesome times, lol was my first moba and I want to thank you for introducing me to a wonderful genre. It will be some time before I am ready to invest in another game of this caliber but I'm sure I'll fall in love again. Thank you for  for all the fun time riot.

But they are NOT skins purchased through the \"illegal' RP, but the most recent purchases? And ON TOP of items being taken away, due to \"illegal\" means, they are also taking away **RECENTLY purchased RP**?\nExcuse me Riot, but shouldn't you JUST be taking back the items that were obtained illegally and call it a day? Bought a few runes, with bad IP, SNATCH, bye bye runes. Bought a skin with bad RP, YOINK, earn that skin biatch. Since you're taking away the items people obtained through cheating, problem solved.... \n\nSo, if you are doing that, then I do not see the reason behind also having to strip peoples accounts of their current RP/IP, especially if you took away the items purchased with said illegal RP/IP to begin with. It is like they are being punished, twice. Taking away the items that were obtained illegally, that is justifiable enough punishment. Instead, you are taking recent purchases from individuals, affecting their friends/family, AND filling up YOUR pockets. Taking back the items they got through illegal means is punishment enough, but taking their money too? What kind of company are you turning into? There is a MUCH better way to handle this, have you all gotten too lazy to fu--ing do it right? \nThis system seems severely flawed to me.","replies":[]},{"poster":"wuttup","date":"2014-12-03T07:28:53.971+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot has greatly disappointed me. Seriously considering quitting for good, despite the amount of cash i have invested. GG Ridiots. you guys fcked this one up. You guys dealt with this specific incident with absolutely 0 consideration.  Zero amount of warning, notification of any sort was given, then riot took action for the SUSPICIOUS activity they assumed. Then the automated response for submitting a ticket gives no helpful information but to threaten players of suspension/termination/deletion of their accounts on further violations.  Honestly taking things that I bought with real rp purchased with real money is unacceptable. I quote riot player support specialist dARTAGNAN : \"we take a great deal of care into making sure that only content purchased with the faudulant RP/IP are removed.\" This statement is a lie. Riot took away your most recent purchases to compensate their loss. In which case effected my friends that have nothing to do with my actions, having their gifts that i paid through legitimate means being revoked. Riot gave no information of what was taken back as compensation, no information is given on how they calculated how much contents had to be revoke (including rp/ip/skins/champs/rune page), or how much they have taken to compensate for it. For all I know they could have taken more than what the old referral system has given me since there is no explanation nor any clarification on that part. I wrote a request for riot to ask them to not take away the gifts to my friends and take away contents from my own account instead, because my friends have nothing to do with what i have gotten through the referral system. My request seemed like it was never even read by anyone, and like i said before, you only get a automated response that give absolutely zero helpful information. On top of that, i purchased way more legitimate rp then what I obtain through the flawed referral system. In conclusion, I no longer love you league of legend......... so sad D': I really wish riot had taken this more seriously and with more care and consideration. I do not understand what riot is trying to achieve with this illogical punishment. There are a billion ways to resolve this issue better. For example, sending a notice out to the player suspected of fraudulent rp and warning them, then give the option of actually purchase rp for the otherwise will be revoked contents. GGWP RIOT.
