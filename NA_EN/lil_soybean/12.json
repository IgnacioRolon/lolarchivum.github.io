She has free abilities in cat form, has a very long range poke that can chunk you with minimal ap, has one of the best heals in the game scaling wise for some reason, a free escape on a fairly low cooldown, and is ranged to poke you at will.\n\nThe fact that you think beating her is as easy as dodging spears is silly, and makes me wonder how often you have played as or against her. I can win a lane with Nid without even throwing a single spear at my opponent because they just can't win a trade. There is no even trade with Nid.Even if you get lucky and poke her down or get her to back off, she just heals. Sure a few other top laners can heal, but they don't have long range poke on top of it, plus the free escapes and super simple wave clear.

I then run at her and engage with Vault for some damage, I bounce off with passive proc on her now, I AA her once for more damage. Then I throw a blind before she can get away for even more damage. Rinse/Repeat. Easy.\n\nNidalee is extremely squishy and susceptible to CC. Learn to dodge/predict the spear... it's quite simple. If you complain about her throwing spears from darkness that you can't dodge, then you are just bad. Either you need to ward better, or you need to pay attention to where you are standing... Don't stand where she can kite you with spears from outside of your vision. You know where the terrain is around you... so position yourself so she can't just stand in open terrain outside of your vision and throw spears at you.\n\nStop crying about how you can't do anything and maybe play a different champ. I have no sympathy for people crying about Nidalee when they are playing melee champs with no CC or gap closers.\n\nYou simply cannot claim a champ is OP or broken or make wild claims like \"can't bait a 2 second CD dude\" when you OBVIOUSLY have people telling you it's possible and not difficult, etc. I'm telling you Nidalee is easy to play against... you are telling me she's impossible to beat. Something doesn't add up here. So we have to break it down to figure out who is right:\n\n1. You are saying Nid is OP\n2. I'm saying she isn't\n\nConclusion: Since I'm able to beat Nidalee consistently, I am proving she is easy to beat. You aren't proving she is hard to beat just by losing to her. You are just proving you aren't smart/good enough to beat her. Therefore,  I am right and Nidalee is not OP.\n\nBTW: No, I'm not a Nidalee main and this isn't a conspiracy...

Fizz has several seconds before he can playful again, and his other dash is targeted, making it extremely predictable.  The best thing you can do against hypermobile champs is to wait for them to blow their dashes.  When they're on cooldown, landing a skill shot is no different than landing it on a zyra.

Amumu has an instant AoE.  Sej's dash and ult are fast and fat enough that if you miss, you fucked up, and again, her dash is on a 5 second cd.  It drops to 1.5 if she kills something.

Get your head out of your ass.  Learn to recognize a fucking weakness and play around it.  She dominates skirmishes.  Not teamfights.  She cannot just dive 5 champs free of charge without someone else enabling the hell out of her.

If you paid any fucking attention to her patterns in games, you'd know that she is only doing as well as her team.  If her team is down, it doesn't matter how fed she is, because she can't 1v5, and her team will melt in teamfights.\n\nNo one is denying that her early game is retarded, or that her kit is fucking retarded, but you seriously need to give credit where credit is due and recognize that she's not an efficient teamfighter.  In case you need any stats to back it up\nhttp://champion.gg/champion/Nidalee/Jungle\n\nIn every role, her win rate falls off in late game.  Now how about you explain that instead of repeatedly shouting some bs about how she's impossible to land a skill shot on like her dash has no downtime.

She's squishy, has no cc, and has to dive in to finish anyone off.  Teamfighting is seroiusly her only weakness.\n\nI guess by this logic zed,ahri,fizz*(old ap fizz,new ad not so much) and le blanc are all shit teamfighters,having not very notable cc,being squishy and having to dive to finish anyone off,she has immense damage output and mobility to protect herself while outputing it.\n\n>I'd rather play someone with combat stealth to do that.  Her strength is her poke.\n\nThat's just one of many.\n \n> I'm not denying that she gets fed a lot.  She is way too good as a pub stomp.  The fact still remains that she has to be ahead to be effective.  Her odds of getting there are another matter.  Again, she's too good at getting there.  No shit.  We all know it.\n\nSo nerf her then? what is this argument about otherwise?\n \n> Learn her cooldowns, dumbass.\n\nthere aren't any,idiot.\n\n>Fizz has several seconds before he can playful again,\n\nOh the horror,poor guy has cd on his skill negating,damaging gapcloser,good thing all cc abilities in this game are spammable,have no cooldown,and are only used for fizz! oh wait...\n\n>and his other dash is targeted, making it extremely predictable.\n\nToo bad it's so fast you can't properly react to it.\n\n>The best thing you can do against hypermobile champs is to wait for them to blow their dashes.\n\ntoo bad you are generally dead by then,or they have gotten away.\n\n>When they're on cooldown, landing a skill shot is no different than landing it on a zyra.\n\nExcept you know,high base movement speed,generally having ms increasing items(lichbane,tri force,botrk,yomumus/etc),and the fact that by the time their mobility is fully on cooldown,the fight is probably already lost(just wait for ahri to blow all dashes,lol)\n\n >Learn some fucking patience.  If she's blowing up your adc, they need a guardian, or someone specifically designated to ride their dick and instapeel (the support?)\n\ntoo bad her sticking power is so rediculous basically only janna can do that,and is considered op due to the fact that she can actually deal with this tier of nonsense.\n\n> Naut for one has targeted cc.\n\nheavily delayed,and naught isn't particularly meta,his early is also particularly bad(which nidalee just loves).\n\n>Amumu has an instant AoE.\n\ntoo bad he needs to get there first,which is skillshot reliant.\n\n>Sej's dash and ult are fast and fat enough that if you miss, you fucked up,\n\nOr you know,she dashed,they aren't big enough to cover her jump range.\n\n>and again, her dash is on a 5 second cd.  It drops to 1.5 if she kills something.  This still leaves an opening where she's vulnerable to lockdown.  I swear, you act like she's just permanently dashing.\n\nYou have this impression where if I slow nidalee for one second she implodes,no,especially if chased she needs to be kept in place and pretty much nobody can do that,carry junglers could add some burst,meaning that you had a better chance at killing her before her mobility gets her away.\n \n> Ok, so she dove in, bursted a carry and popped zhonyas.  I've never seen an AP champ do that before.  Ever.  Only nidalee can do this.\n\nWell,they tend to either die after(or be very vunerable),or be pretty stupid in their own right(if you want to compare her to lb,that's a fair comparison).\n \n> No.  Fuck you.  Get your head out of your ass.  Learn to recognize a fucking weakness and play around it. \n\nExcept she doesn't have any meaningful ones.\n\n>She dominates skirmishes.  Not teamfights.  She cannot just dive 5 champs free of charge without someone else enabling the hell out of her.  If your team didn't lose a bunch of lanes on their own, you should be able to hold your own in a fight.  \n\nExcept that she,realizing that,starts splitpushing,cause you know,can't catch this shit.\n \n>   If her team is down, it doesn't matter how fed she is, because she can't 1v5, and her team will melt in teamfights.\n\nI can say that for every fucking champion.\n\n> No one is denying that her early game is retarded, or that her kit is fucking retarded, but you seriously need to give credit where credit is due and recognize that she's not an efficient teamfighter.

You HAVE to be near minions in order to farm.\nShe does indeed lack sustain, but has a lot more control,  slows, snare and even a stun post 6\nIt also has a longer range, and give you some juking potential, aim one way, walk the other.\nIf she lands a spear on the carries still still has to go into melee, at this point peeler's jcan get her off  or scare her from ever going in in the first place. Additionally, for Nidalee, if someone is out of position, all she can do is damage. Lsisandra not only has good burst also, she stuns then for 2 then root them for her team.
