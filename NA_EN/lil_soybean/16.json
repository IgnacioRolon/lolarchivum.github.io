Super quickly QWQ a spot with enemies running in that direction, and they either freeze to avoid it, or freeze because they stepped on it and got stunned.\n\n**HOWEVER,** his rework introduced some major problems that probably lend to him being one of the lowest pickrate & lowest winrate champions in the entire game.\n\n**Here&#039;s where the real issue lies.  You have two skill paths to choose from as Zilean, realistically:**\n\n**1) **You max your bomb in lane, so that you actually hurt the enemy with your poke instead of it being something thresh blocks with his lantern casually every ~8-10 seconds.  So, okay, you have decently damaging but unreliable poke.\nThe problem is that you transition into being much worse mid-game because your slow is so much worse than it used to be, even maxing it second.  So you poke decently in lane, but are slow and unhelpful after the laning phase.  \n\n**OR:**\n\n**2)** You max your Speed and then your Rewind.  The result?  Your laning phase is mega-shitty; you do nearly no damage, save for at level 1 perhaps.  But you have a potent slow/speed up to set up ganks relatively easily, if the jungler decides to come.  But more importantly, you&#039;re **actually useful** after the laning phase ends.  You get to keep yourself super-rapid most of the time, running around, hard to catch, throwing wards and scouting bushes with bombs, etc.  It&#039;s at this point that he can make huge plays happen just by using his speed/slow to assist a tanky or melee champion (usually his toplaner or jungler).\n\nSo either you have a mediocre laning phase, then become shitty, or you start off shitty, then become potentially REALLY helpful.\n\nThe 2nd option sounds better.  And that&#039;s where you run into his major problem.  If you want to be very useful mid-game as Zilean, you have to take the level route that makes you horribly weak in lane.  And what tends to dominate the support meta?\n\nChampions that can make squishies instantly die if they land one ability at the right moment.  {{champion:412}} {{champion:53}} {{champion:1}} {{champion:25}}\nAKA, champions with absurdly strong lane-presence just from their utility.\n\nSo, for example, Annie can max whatever she wants first and still be extremely useful in lane by landing a stun on the enemy.  If Zilean wants to have any sort of presence like that in lane, he has to max his bombs, and even then, it&#039;s less reliable for damage and pretty much useless for actually stunning & killing the enemy.  (You can get lucky and land a double bomb, and then you have nothing but auto attacks to hurt the stunned target.  Morgana, for example, can pool beneath you.  Annie has a burst rotation.  Thresh can flay & follow up with enhanced autos.  Blitz has the knockup and, at 6, the silence.)\n\nYou get the point.  The way his kit is designed turned him from previously a reliable lane poker into now _\"You only get to have one of your abilities be useful; the bombs, or the speed/slow.  Choose wisely.\"_\n\nThat is the fundamentally broken part in my eyes.  I really would like my bombs to be useful.  But if I sacrifice even one point in my E/W, I&#039;m sacrificing a huge part of my speed/slowing power, so I can&#039;t afford to make my bombs useful.\n\nOh, and one last thing.  As mentioned before; the speed-cap/\"diminishing returns\" on your speed boost really, really sucks.  It&#039;s up from 55% to 99% now - almost 2x as much of a bonus - but it certainly doesn&#039;t feel anywhere near 2x as strong.  Only slightly stronger, maybe 15-20% more.  Although it does feel really potent on enemy champions now, that&#039;s counteracted by how short the duration is.\n\nAt 40% CDR and max level W and E, you still can&#039;t have your E on yourself permanently.  The old Zilean could have himself sped up permanently and still speed up someone nearby a bit as well.  Theoretically the gaps in your speed boost are \"made up for\" by the increased speed effectiveness, but that isn't actually the case because of the diminishing returns on speed bonues.  This is probably, by design, supposed to be balanced by the fact that shorter but faster speed bursts lend to better escapes & easier skillshot dodging, which is quite nice.  But it came at the cost of the end-game fantasy of Zoom Zoom Zilsta being permanently super-fast like he could be before.\n\nLast but not least, the decrease from 7s to 5s on the ulti sounds like counterplay addition, but it became more of an issue of baiting your allies into killing themselves.  They see the ulti, hesitate, then decide to go in and try to die with it.   So either 1) they die with it and then get killed on the spot upon revival, which was already an issue before, or more pressingly; 2) they panic and run into the enemies and die a brief moment after your mark expires.\nAs a Zilean player, it&#039;s really disappointing how many times I&#039;ve heard people sadly comment how the Zilean ult just barely ran out by the time they died.  But the irony is, if they didn&#039;t have my ultimate on them, **THEY MIGHT HAVE JUST RUN AWAY TO BEGIN WITH.**\n\nIs the impact of what I&#039;m saying here being fully understood?  Zilean&#039;s ulti, which is supposed to specifically save someone&#039;s life, now often _kills your ally_ by baiting them just long enough into running by the enemies and getting killed after the mark expires.\n\nSo yeah, taking away the bomb&#039;s reliability, then nerfing his E range (which really, really sucks) to make sure the bombs stay unreliable, then also making his ulti sometimes kill your allies by reducing the mark duration - the addition of the stun, as powerful as it is, really didn&#039;t compensate him enough.  \n\nThere needs to be an improvement.  It can seem small but actually be extremely helpful.\n\nThe best and simplest change would be to revert his E's range back to the old range.  This would increase bomb reliability as well as allowing you to help out allies from a more reasonable range.  It'd be massively helpful on him, and this change alone could possibly bring him into viability versus champions like Thresh/Alistar.\n\nAnother possibility is making his W on precisely a low enough cooldown at rank 5 that at MAX CDR and MAX RANK in W, you can once again reach the end-game fantasy of keeping the speed boost of E applied to yourself *permanently*.\n\nThis is probably the thing that made him the most fun before, and the most devastating thing they removed from him.  The ability to stay permanently sped once you finally met the right conditions later on in the game.\n\nThe maths are a little too wonky for myself, but essentially, with 40% CDR and W at max rank, you need to be able to pull your E off cooldown precisely every 2.5 seconds, which is just as long as the speed's duration.  So you can permanently speed yourself (at the cost of constant mana drain) or you can alternate speeding yourself and an ally non-permanently.\nI don't know what W cooldown would facilitate this - it seems that it would be 4.16666~ seconds, so that at 40% CDR it's at precisely 2.5 seconds between uses - but 4.16666~s cooldown is a little bit strange, so making his W a flat 4s cooldown at rank 5 would be IMMENSELY helpful on its own, both in terms of viability and in terms of FUN.\n\nBecause of either of these W and E improvements, he wouldn&#039;t need to have his bombs changed, because his kit would synergize better  - with the return to the old range on his E, it would actually be used to land the bombs more easily now, which should be the whole point, instead of them lowering his E&#039;s range to purposely avoid that.  With how squishy he is, you can&#039;t really get in E range to land your bombs now that the E range was nerfed.  It needs these improvements.\n\nLast but not least; scrap the passive, or buff it.  Make it something you actually feel.\n\nSo, consequences of these changes:  Zilean, at his peak, becomes nearly un-catchable due to how constantly fast he is, while also being extremely difficult to escape with his _permanent wither._  (Well, the movement speed part, anyway.)\n\nThe trade offs?  \n\nTo begin with, he still has the terrible two-paths issue in his kit, where either your bombs are useless or your slow is near-useless.  Basically, in a world dominated by early-game powerhouse supports, he would be the fragile, weak-early but **hyper-scaling, late-game support**.\n\nFurthermore, he still has to get in harm's way to cast his ulti on allies, even at his full-strength late game.  \n\n\n**At the cost of having nearly zero kill potential in-lane, as well as being an easy source of kills for the enemy if they land a single hook/pull/bind/stun, he gets rewarded for chugging through the early game with what would be an incredible late-game, after even just one of these changes.**\n\nBasically, he becomes the first hyper-scaling support.  But not off of Gold.  Scaling off of experience, which he will get over time, and which makes sense with his passive.  \nUncatchable and inescapable if you reach his perfect late-game fantasy, but good luck getting there.\n\nAre you getting what I'm saying?\n\n>>>>The Chronokeeper would not only be funner, and more reliable, but his identity would be the support that becomes stronger and stronger **WITH TIME!**<<<\n\n{{champion:26}} {{champion:245}}  {{champion:26}} **TIME!!!!**{{champion:26}} {{champion:245}}  {{champion:26}}\n\nHis passive might not even need to be changed, because his scaling is based mostly off of getting to level 18 so your abilities are max level, so having a passive that promotes the \"fight towards your late-game max level over time\" identity would actually be good for his kit if these changes went through!\n\nAgain; these are my long, drawn-out thoughts, and I&#039;m sure you guys won&#039;t feel like reading it all, but thanks for reading whatever parts of it that you do.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nOne last thing, in regards to people suggesting they replace his W.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Lil Soybean,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=AxQE5hpK,comment-id=00100000,timestamp=2015-08-17T23:45:21.249+0000)\n>\n> This would make him into a different champion.\n> \n> That's the issue I have with most 'time ability' suggestions.

The problem is that taking the 1st path, where you max your bombs, is pretty worthless against many poke-mitigating supports (Morgana, Janna, Sona, Soraka...) or, the damage is just negligible against the rest of the support roster, which consists of tanks with double Zilean's hp.\n\nBut then, the 2nd path, which starts you off with horribly weak laning but makes you stronger later, doesn't scale Zilean hard enough to justify being one of the most useless supports in the game pre-6.  If a support doesn't have the ability to easily peel for his/her team and ADC, then they typically need to have the power to get their ADC fed pre-6 somehow.  Zilean basically has neither the kill potential or the peeling power, except for sort of the peeling power later on by slowing down enemies targeting his adc while speeding up the adc himself.  But it doesn't compare to hard CC that actually stops an enemies attacks.  I mean, what good does it do to slow Diana when she jumps onto my ADC and insta-bursts them?  If I was playing someone like Blitz, I could've silenced/chain-CC'd them.  Even as someone like Morgana, I could stop her dash by rooting her.  Zilean's \"peel\" doesn't stop mobility moves from closing this gap on him or his ADC, meaning that his ADC is still a very viable target for assassination - which is totally fine, because his ultimate is designed to counteract that!  \n\nThe problem is that he blows his ultimate to attempt to provide one ally the same level of safety that supports like blitz and Janna can provide with their basic abilities.  I'm not suggesting a further rework - I like his current abilities, and I'm fine with him having this lack of reliable hard-CC as part of his weakness - **but the problem is that he's not compensated enough in his actual areas of strength.  **  Hence my proposed changes, to make him viable and solidify his hyper-scaling identity.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Blade of Justic","date":"2015-08-17T20:59:41.508+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"As someone who really likes Zilean, I came into this thread like this:\n\nhttp://rs921.pbsrc.com/albums/ad52/Obsessive_Jess/Other/Woody_zps5975078e.gif~c200\n\nBut after reading this and realizing that you're tweaking numbers and aren't recommending something like getting rid of his W, I was like this:\n\nhttp://i50.tinypic.com/1zdra8m.gif\n\n+1 for someone that actually understands why Zilean has problems.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Takeuchi 17","date":"2015-04-23T17:41:53.981+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"there was another forum post similar to this.

Once he has your target CC'd, slow your enemy so they have to burn Flash to get away. Then Talisman everyone out of the fight and move on to the next objective.\n\nI've been thinking maybe Zilean needs a passive change similar to Viktor's. An item, say a stop watch, that upgrades with gold and/or successful ults on players. Wih 3 ults, the stopwatch grants Zilean further Chronokeeper abilities by allowing your W to target allies for a 3 second reduction to their cooldowns.(Zilean would not gain the 10 second rewind for his skills). At 7 saves, Zilean further unlocks the stop watch and can target an enemy champion with his W, INCREASING their cooldown by 3 seconds. At 10+ saves, his W becomes an AoE that affects everyone but Zilean. His W is still usable as normal if he chooses to, this would just give him more utility.","replies":[{"poster":"Takeuchi 17","date":"2015-04-23T18:27:14.054+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I dunno.

I've read it now, and it actually sounds pretty cool.\n\nThat being said, it also sounds out of place in his kit, just \"thematically\" matching the time theme but without actually synergizing very meaningfully with his kit.\n\nAnd it also sounds extremely broken, lol. :P","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Aerilus","date":"2015-08-17T20:42:33.389+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The main reason I feel Zilean is underpowered, is that it feels like he only has 3 abilities, and his only offensive ability is not good enough to make up for the other abilities.\n\nPassive - 8% Additional Experience - Seems kind of low for a passive that only gives experience, I feel this should be a bit higher like 10-12%. I don't ever recall being more than 1-2 levels higher than my enemy as Zilean, so I doubt this passive effect is doing much of anything..\n\nQ - Only does decent damage early game or if you spam it all the time using W. The stun is useful and it is possible to land, but not frequently. It's unreliable sometimes,  but not as unreliable as his R\n\nW - Only resets cooldown on Q, and E, doesn't feel like it's useful enough to be a full ability. I feel this should include one extra effect like healing Zilean for a small amount or giving him a shield (as if rewinding time could have healed or prevented wounds)\n\nE - Slow enemy or speed up feels alright, although it feels like it should last a little longer for how weak it is early game, and it can be unreliable. If your team doesn't respond by run away/ or chase the enemy when you're planning to speed them up, then your E can quickly become useless. Sometimes it takes the full duration of the E for my teammate to notice I casted it on them ( same problem with R really )\n\nR - Great Skill, but extremely unreliable. It's very easy for your teammate to accidentally run away when Zilean's ult is on him because they either don't notice it or they're afraid it'll wear off before they die. It's also very easy for enemies to detect if his ult is on someone except during huge team fights, and even then I've frequently had enemies just stop attacking my ally who has 30 hp because they see my ult on him, and then they just wait and finish him off. Maybe this skill could reduce cooldown on itself if the ult fails to resurrect anybody.\n\n\nBecause the way his kit is setup, if he can't help his allies by bombing them or speeding them up/slowing down enemies because they have lots of cc or too much damage for him to get in close all the time, then Zilean will easily be cancelled out. If the enemies have lots of damage overall sometimes his ult will even be useless.\n\nSo when it comes to supporting, his Q is good for harass/zoning, his E is good for slowing them down/speed up allies, and R is good for resurrection in rare cases. Overall this makes him way too weak against any support or champs that have good cc. His speed up can help allies get away from CC, but it is only useful if your team makes use of it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lil Soybean","date":"2015-04-25T02:46:12.274+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"b x2","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lil Soybean","date":"2015-04-24T18:17:27.414+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"b","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lil Soybean","date":"2015-04-24T09:57:39.393+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"b","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lil Soybean","date":"2015-04-24T03:01:43.379+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"b x2 combop","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lil Soybean","date":"2015-04-23T22:33:32.281+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"b","replies":[]},{"poster":"Solidair3","date":"2015-04-23T16:34:43.619+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been doing well with him, is he really that weak?","replies":[{"poster":"Lil Soybean","date":"2015-04-23T17:25:37.100+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Solidair3,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=AxQE5hpK,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-04-23T16:34:43.619+0000)\n>\n> I've been doing well with him, is he really that weak?\n\nHe's not useless, he's just sort of a 'why would you ever play Zilean would you could play X?' champion.\n\nFor example.  Thresh can probably save more lives just by casually using his lantern throughout the game.  Thresh is amazing due to utility, regardless of how many points he has in any skills, unlike Zilean.\nOf course, Zilean is extremely fun to play, but...","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lil Soybean","date":"2015-04-23T11:58:21.478+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lots of current discussion on this.
