Yes those are ways to negate his damage. Now, I see you want to be able to beat Zed with any champion (while still possible, general rules when there is this many characters to choose from is that some will work best against other, will some other will not be the best choice against other, otherwise), but i think that isnt the best selection of champion to do so. Ahri has a skill matchup, Xerath can pull it if he plays it perfectly, Vel'Koz and Anivia can do it. Lux and current veigar might not be the best choices. The rest can win the matchup, it has been seen in competitive, so i guess if you are confortable enough of those champion to pick it against Zed, you should be able to do so. Unless you are just being outplayed by a better player, that happen to be playing Zed.\n\n> Yeah, he has no escape and no energy. But he cleared the wave, so he's not in range.

If you are unable to organize this, may i suggest learn to CS under tower better ?\n\n> This.

I am pretty sure even a Zed who is 0/3 and behind in lane can pop any squishy with 1 cycle of CDs and BotRK Active. Watch LCS. \n\nA burst mage needing 2 auto attacks to finish off a squishy is much much worse than zed requiring 2 auto attacks to finish off a squishy. Also, none of the burst mages can split push because of this reason, their auto attacks sucks. Not the same for Zed. \n\nAgain, I am pretty sure his Q and E shadow can easily kill caster minions WITHOUT Zed using his W again.  \n\nThe only thing the mana regen buffs is gonna do is, it will prevent mages to be in a vulnerable position so Zed can all-in at 6 and take the free kill.

You are not counting Ignite, his passive and auto attack damage which contributes to significant portion of his ult damage. Just watch any Zed lvl 6 kill in youtube. There are quite a few of them. \n\nOnly thing stopping a Zed from not killing you at lvl 6 is if your champ has cc and you can land it. In most cases, its upto the Zed to screw up get hit by the CC. Does this make it so he can get killed? No.. Just ult back to your shadow and voila! you are safe.. See what I mean by safe laning?\n\nYou are wrong again about the split push. 2 things. Assassins like Zed roam because noone can 1v1 him and win once he gets BotRK. Also, assassins like Zed and Leblanc can easily escape any gank by enemy team usually forcing them to dedicate 2 or more to kill them. Zed's team can take objectives in the mean-time. This is the idea behind split-pushing not because Zed cant handle mages in lane.\n\nIf zed cant REALLY handle mages in lane, then pro teams would lane swap Zed with top (usually) because any team with Zed would want to get the Zed going so he can split push later (see above)\n\nAlso, assassins are roaming now more than any .

Why the guy who gets to summon a shadow out to duplicate his attacks gets a 900 range shuriken that passes through targets and scales 100% with AD while Kennen gets a 950 range shuriken that has a smaller hit box and gets stopped by the first target hit.   And the funny thing is, Kennen may be the \"Ranged\" champion, but he needs to build a whole lot more defensive items than Zed will ever have to.  \n\nFavoritism shouldn't exist in the balance department, but it clearly does.

I dislike Zed, and Kennen is one of my favorites (he was my main in S2 when I first started), but even I find this just ridiculous.\n\nZed does not bring AOE stuns. That is the single difference that justifies everything you mentioned. Kennen's teamfighting is leagues and miles ahead of Zeds. Kennen has insane amounts of utility - and he brings some damn good damage with it too. \n\nI'm not sure why you point out that Kennen has to blow his escape to waveclear effectively when Zed has to literally do the exact same thing. Zeds W is his escape. He has to use it to clear waves. \n\nKennens Q would be completely and utterly broken if it had the hitbox of Zeds Q or passed through units. For one, Zed has to use TWO abilities for his Shuriken to have 900 range, Kennens Q simply already has huge range. For two, if Kennen hits you with his Q, he can then hit you with his W, which goes over minions and except for going untargetable cannot be dodged whatsoever. \n\nFinally, Kennen may be ranged, but he builds defensive items because his teamfighting involves freaking charging into the middle of the enemy team and trying to stun as many people as you can. Arguing that Kennen building defensive items is somehow a disadvantage compared to Zed makes no sense. Zed doesn't build very many defensive items because he has no utility to deliver, the only contribution he has in teamfights is his raw damage output. There are very few assassins in the game that have any reason to build more than 2 defensive items. Kennen, by contrast, delivers very significant AOE damage (which is much stronger than Zeds own AOE), and also delivers teamwide stuns. Kennen is not an assassin, he's a utility mage. Therefore, he benefits greatly from surviving in order to get off as many stuns as possible.\n\nThis anti-Zed circlejerk has gone too far.
