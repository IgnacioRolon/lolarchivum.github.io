Seen in support by Edward from Gambit long time a go, so support Kennen is not new.\n\nXerath was played as a Ziggs replacement for wave clear stall late game AP threat after Ziggs got nerfed.  Not seen since minions buffed, Ziggs seen since he was buffed.\n\nCho'gath saw a huge bugfix to overlapping CC which had kept him out of competitive play for nearly 2 years due to its frequent occurrences on him.

Bard as a general pick for someone who hasn't played the support role/Bard specifically is a TERRIBLE idea, however in team play with experience Bard could turn out to be a new insane pick.

He can solo dragon at level 3. However, if you want a jungler that can gank, Yorick might not be the best. He has a fairly short range slow and that's his ganking tool.  His movement speed buff only works if he's hit something, and smacking someone with a shovel is difficult if they can dash away, stun you at range, or just walk away from you if you enter at the wrong time.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-05-09T09:52:21.585+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The Undead crew is real.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Preacher Saiba","date":"2015-05-09T15:27:49.260+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly if i saw an uncommon pick i thought the opposite,i assumed that they were good with the champ since it was a niche pick and played way more defensively.","replies":[]},{"poster":"terkmc","date":"2015-05-09T12:44:45.574+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Be{{champion:82}} \nTeam complain because muh no cc, muh non-meta\nFeed first blood because shitty early game\nTeam threaten report\nProceed to take over the lane, 20 cs advantage, force opponent back constantly\nJungle gank\nMuh Double Kill\nCarry team, enemy team screaming Morde op\nSuch is life\nHue","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ariel the Cruel","date":"2015-05-09T04:51:05.045+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">Now stop, and consider that YOU ARE THAT PERSON.\n\nI've had more luck with more \"Troll\" picks than you can shake a Teemo at.
