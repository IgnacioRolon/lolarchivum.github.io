Back when tanks could take 40-50% more damage than they do now, Nid was still chunking them for AT LEAST 25% of their hp per spear hit. AT LEAST. Now they can't take as much as they did before due to several nerfs and removal of their items.

If you think that a team running away is a team that's lost you're out of your mind. It's never over until the nexus is dead.\n\nKiting back in a teamfight is a strategy. Running for the hills after you've realized you lost the fight is not a strategy. Being able to catch people who try to run away from you in a teamfight doesn't make you a good teamfight champion if that's all you can do. {{champion:23}}{{champion:77}} {{champion:64}} and {{champion:92}} are all good at chasing down fleeing enemies, but I wouldn't call them strong teamfighting champs either.","replies":[{"poster":"Delimon","date":"2015-04-05T00:46:53.860+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=DarthLeon,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=IP5lH5I8,comment-id=00150000000000000000,timestamp=2015-04-05T00:44:02.350+0000)\n>\n> Kiting back in a teamfight is a strategy. Running for the hills after you've realized you lost the fight is not a strategy. Being able to catch people who try to run away from you in a teamfight doesn't make you a good teamfight champion if that's all you can do. {{champion:23}} is also really good at chasing fleeing enemies, as is {{champion:77}}, but I wouldn't call them strong teamfighting champs either.\n\nExcept that IS a strategy. It's called getting the fuck out of there before you give the enemy free gold. But if you have ever played in higher elo, people who are running bite back. I can't tell you how many times I've not wanted to fight someone, them forcing me to fight them, and then me coming out on top. Don't mistake people running for easy picks. Sometimes they just don't want to fight you and forcing them to is not always a good idea.","replies":[{"poster":"Slamurai Jack","date":"2015-04-05T01:05:30.618+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Delimon,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=IP5lH5I8,comment-id=001500000000000000000000,timestamp=2015-04-05T00:46:53.860+0000)\n>\n> Except that IS a strategy.

How can you even presume to talk to me about high elo? I'm in Plat 3 atm, and even that's not high elo. And there's a difference between moving back to try and get better positioning vs. running in a desperate attempt to save your life.\n\n If a {{champion:9}}  or {{champion:85}}  ults in, and the entire enemy team disengages and kites back until the ult is over, and then resumes the fight, that is a strategy. If a Sejuani throws her ult and hits 3 people, and then the Vel'koz on her team ults and brings the entire enemy team to low health while killing one or two, the survivors running desperately trying not to die is not a strategy. It's a rout.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"manbearswine","date":"2015-04-05T00:09:38.374+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well not exactly,it's both of them combined,take singed for example,chasing the guy is well,generally not very doable,but he has to stay to do anything,if he just gets in and out he's not actually doing anything,he needs to stay and spread his poison,if you get him low and force him to back he won't return 8 seconds later with his cooldowns refreshed to blow another guy up,the issue with nidalee,same with le blanc,that on one hand you have to catch them or they will keep deleting your teammates,but on the other hand that's pretty much impossible.\n\nIf you want to put others at risk,you need to put yourself at risk.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Knight SoIaire ","date":"2015-04-04T14:47:27.663+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":8,"body":"> Nidalee's problem isn't her offensive power at all...
