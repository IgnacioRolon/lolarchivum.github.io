I hear you guys - 5s is a bit too long against some champions.  but going from a 2.5s silence to a 4 second cripple is a decent trade-off.  It prevents way less spells, but gets 1.5s more duration at rank 5.)**\n\n**EDIT: It would also interrupt channels at the start, like his current silence.**\n\nSo - for example - Riven wouldn&#039;t be able to Q or E still.  ADCs wouldn&#039;t be able to dash away.  No one could flash.\n\nBecause it opens up more counterplay than a silence, it would allow him to still stick to targets while also opening up his kit for even more buffs.\nAside from aiding him in sticking to targets, it&#039;d give him a more solid identity of not letting targets escape, who are usually way too slippery.  I.E. Nidalee, Riven, etc.\n\nA funny effect of this is that it COULD essentially act as a Blind on Kalista as well, preventing her hopping, if Riot wanted her passive to function as a 'mobility spell'.  (But she'd have new options, such as using her Ulti still, whereas before she would be silenced out of it.)\n\nAnother idea - it could possibly function as a silence (like before) when used on the &#039;Villain&#039;.  (The enemy that gets marked with the new function in his rework.)  But that would be way too much with the 5s duration, so there would need to be more tuning.\n\nThis is just a thought.

I know you guys are really trying to make League its own game, and you've done a great job of that, I don't think anyone in their right minds who has played a MOBA could ever confuse DOTA with League, or League with Smite, and vice versa.  But in terms of the hard crowd control effect \"cripple\", it has to be constant across all games.\n\nThe way cripple is done in Smite is that it prevents all dash and leap based abilities.  Every other ability works as intended.  For example, if I were to somehow bring Ares into League, land my shackles on say, LeBlanc, LeBlanc would be able to cast her Q and E, but not her W.  If I were to cripple Thresh, he could cast his Q to land his hook, but couldn't recast it to jump to his target.  \n\nI think we can all agree that the mobility creep has overstayed its welcome.  These Juggernaut changes are a good first step.  Now it's time to really shoot mobile champs in the foot.  Cripple is a good way to really get rid of the hopscotch that's going on in League right now.  An even better one would be to give a future champion an ultimate ability that only works on champions mid dash (in the same way Yasuo can only cast his ultimate on airborne targets) and pull them to said champion (like Awilix does in Smite).\n\nYou do this, and champion diversity becomes a real thing again.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Valenten","date":"2015-08-10T16:19:30.631+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"AIGHT a cripple stops any movement abilities from as small as tumble to ahris dashes.

Mobility creep is met by anti-mobility creep. You're just playing top trumps. Would an alternative solution simply be to make mobility interact with existing crowd control effects? Slows reduce dash speed, for example (heck, MS modifiers both positive and negative - since the nerf should be coupled with a minor compensation). Cripple would make an excellent addition, I feel, but it shouldn't be the only solution. Garen shouldn't be the only option in champion select. Nasus should be able to Wither Riven and slow her down, both moving and her Q's speed.

If Riven can't get some kind of edge, she won't win. Garen has just the counter to that. If she tries to jump at him, he can press W to negate a ton of the damage and press Q for the silence, following up with the E. From there, he wins the trade by having negating her initial burst, then silenced her to prevent her onslaught, and of course returned the damage by using his very high damaging E. Even if she does double the damage in the trade, Garen comes out on top because of his base regen and his passive's regen. He's able to top himself off without even caring while Riven has subpar health regen.","replies":[{"poster":"Dextix LT","date":"2015-08-10T12:34:35.235+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wrong. Farm is more than enough for riven to be good and win. No smart riven will unleash her combo while garen is in his w. Andany riven will shield his q and then because of the passive attack garen and outtrade him.\n\nAnd no, garen wont be able to regen that fast. People think that garens passive is like mundos it seems. After 1 fight like that unless garen is under his turret, the second attack will result in a kill for riven and she wont care about any regen.\n\nWhen ppl defend riven they always go \"But regen\" regen doesnt matter to a champion which can kill you in 2 trades because of his kit.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Mistress Madoka","date":"2015-08-10T08:49:44.551+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Garen doesn't \"Trade\"\n\nHe Wears you down slowly and Punishes you the moment he gets an opening","replies":[{"poster":"Dextix LT","date":"2015-08-10T09:04:08.306+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"And how will a garen wear a riven down if any time he tries she can just e and punish the garen?","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
