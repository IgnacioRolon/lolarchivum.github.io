If a Yi is facerolling your team for the first 15 minutes of the game, don&#039;t come complain about Sated Devourer being broken on the forums - \n- **Because you&#039;re being killed by a champion before their devourer is even sated yet.**\n\nIt&#039;s confirmation bias.  You hear \"Sated is OP!!!\" So if you see a Yi win ever, you suddenly confirm in your mind; \"Yep, Sated must be broken.\"  The irony is that half the time, they&#039;re snowballing before they even Satiate their devourer.  Maybe he was just strong to begin with?\n\nAnother irony is that if you assume \"lol tanks are dead!!\" and thus play only squishies, then of course sated will hit hard on you.  No, they did not suddenly make Maokai any less capable of soaking tons of damage.  Or plenty of other tanks.

IF you do not develop enough advantages during this stage, and before that stage, then that's where the issue lies. It's not so much about denying them farm, as it is about taking advantage of things while it's 4v5 and getting a 6k gold lead at 18 minutes then rolling all over them with superior map control.","replies":[{"poster":"Hissael","date":"2015-07-11T12:18:58.816+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, you are right if we can't build enough advantage, it is our \"fault\".

The amount of map pressure and pick potential that gives you is more than enough to snowball the game if you play it out properly.  You need to play well in order to beat it, that's all. I'm pretty sure it was oddone who called it an overall bad item, because if the other team plays correctly, the other team smacks you into  the dirt and snowballs so hard SD dosen't matter.","replies":[{"poster":"Hissael","date":"2015-07-11T16:08:22.367+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The thing is two turrets isn't gonna be important because even with pick potential and map pressure, the SD still can prevent and take control of the snowball.

If it weren't then darius would be even MORE useless than he is now, riven would be removed from the game, and tryndamere would be the new mascot for top lane. Balancing for people who can't play the game dosen't make sense. It's better to balance around the top level of play in any game.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Dengeden","date":"2015-07-11T07:35:57.033+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"People can't handle assassins remember? And essentially, that's what SD champions are.\n\nThe 5 dragon threat will always be a thing, so you have to secure at least one. That hasn't changed.\n\nDo you mean \"ganking\" (when a jungler comes to your lane for a kill) or \"ganging (up)\" (grouping up as 4 or 5 people). No offense but I'm a little confused as to what you mean. \nIf it's the first one, then ... no, sated devourer champions do care about how strong the enemy laners are. If it's the second one and you have a problem with split push, it's a matter of vision control.\n\nI'd also like to say I've won multiple games with Tahm Kench jungle and yes, I did play him as a Cinderhulk tank. Heck, he's not even an ideal jungler, his clear sucks.","replies":[{"poster":"Hissael","date":"2015-07-11T12:00:48.619+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I know people can't handle assassins and I know that SD champs are assassins too. I am fine with assassins, it's their job to kill the squishies and die or barely live if caught between enemy team. Also tanks should be by definition assassins natural enemy. However SD case changes everything. SD user can literally go in, kill everyone without a noticeable HP lose. It would have been fine if they operate as assassins, killing 1 to 3 champs and dying or barely surviving, but current state of the item is making them gods that can 1 v 5 and probably live with decent health.\n\nSecond thing, of course dragon is an important objective and 5 drake is always gonna be thing, however currently securing 1 or 2 dragons doesn't matter for the enemy SD user, because whenever he finishes his SD, our team is completely denied from leaving the base. He can just zone us into one lane or inside the base and forget about dragon, because you won't be getting it and he doesn't need to take it at all after SD. Thus it becomes something to hunt for fun rather than very important objective to their team.\n\nAbout ganging thing, I meant jungler coming into the lane and ganging. Sorry for the miscommunication, I am not a native speaker. About it, they really don't care that much about enemy lanes getting stronger because they know that even a bad doing lane could farm under turret without feeding the enemy to a level where SD can't exceed. So they don't care about ganging and stacks up constantly until he reaches the point, which is around 20 minute for most SD users. And addition to that if the enemy jungler is also a SD user, it becomes which one finishes the item first so deny the other from all of his camps. In that scenario no one gets a gang, so it is pretty much 1 v 1 lane where it is pretty hard to feed the enemy into a god level.\n\nCongratz on your victory with Tahm jungle, I want to try it out sometime. It is manageable to win with Tahm, but did you have a SD user in the enemy team, which is quite likely because it is out of control right now? However, even though you won against SD junglers, it doesn't mean the item isn't broken after completion.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Incognonymous","date":"2015-07-11T01:22:37.958+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":2,"body":"Yi can stack a Devourer in 15 minutes.","replies":[{"poster":"TheVishual","date":"2015-07-11T21:19:02.486+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Incognonymous,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=8PlvmYNP,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2015-07-11T01:22:37.958+0000)\n>\n> Yi can stack a Devourer in 15 minutes.\n\nThis is literally not possible unless you get every single dragon and every single camp and every single scuttler along with like 5-6 kills","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Cupkek","date":"2015-07-11T03:24:59.348+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"The issue is mainly that post-satiation and Bork, he can build tank and then become a % max HP on-hit bruiser while being able to Alpha Strike every few seconds because of the auto-attack cooldown being even further reduced by Sated Devourer. \n\nMy issue with Sated Devourer is that it makes an already great dueling/splitpushing champion even better while giving them all the DPS they could possibly need, so they build tank items afterward, making them unkillable. \n\nIt's not just Yi either, Shyvana and Xin Zhao both jump exponentially in power with Sated Devourer.
