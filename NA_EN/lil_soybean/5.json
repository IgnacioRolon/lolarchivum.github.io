Unlike Zed who warps out regardless.\n\n*However* - the fact that his kit is pretty much **point at the enemy and hit every key** is definitely not healthy.  You appear on them.  They explode.  Or they don't explode, and you probably die.\n\n**So the skill is in his decision-making.**  Can I assassinate that person?  Is it worth the risk of diving in?

His skillcap would become significantly lower.  *\"Can I blow them up?  Definitely.  Can they retaliate?  Obviously not.  Will I die?

Like the majority of the players would agree that instead of a slow on his e he should have a different utility. Like interrupting channels or a micro-silence. I've seen maybe one thread on here that suggests we give him zed-like abilities, most are just asking for riot to retain some of his old game-play mechanics, such as preventing casters from destroying their team. \n\nAlso, having the silence on cutthroat did add decisional/mechanical depth to his game-play, because some targets are more inhibited by being silenced than others. For example: i would much rather silence a xerath or syndra channeling damage from the back line than a tryndamere or caitlynn who just auto attack away and wreck my team. Riot's the ones who removed this depth from talon's game-play thereby molding him into a jump on the squishiest target and unload champ.\n\nYou shouldn't lose sight of the fact that riot literally removed his niche as an anti-mage. Now his chances of being viable in competitive play have completely been thrown out the window and they know it. The truth is that they really don't care and that's what is pissing most people off. Champs like lucian or lee sin or zed are nerfed very cautiously, whereas talon was the same champ for 4 years, then all of the sudden: hey he can't silence anymore because its super unhealthy for the game. They didn't ask for any sort of feedback, didn't give adequate compensation buffs, and then said they would look over how the changes were received, which was overwhelmingly negative, but they just left it at that and haven't said a word in the last 4 months. It's just a slap in the face for the people who play this champ, me included. Of course, I'm not gonna stop playing him, but I'll be damned if I don't try my best to see that this champ receives equal treatment just like the rest of the champs in this game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cindikle","date":"2015-02-04T06:16:58.062+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think anyone really thinks his silence was healthy. \n\nPeople are just mad that he was so highly balanced around it.

Talon is the definition of a healthy assassin (although he's a weak contender in the current meta) while Zed could use some nerfs for the better. \n\nI have no friggin' idea why Riot said Zed was healthy.

The knife collides with anything.  Minions, champs, and jungle mobs.  Now, for X amount of time (i.e. 5 seconds) Talon can use his regular E to jump to any target, point and click like always, the slow like it is now.  However, if he jumps to the target he hit with the knife, he will also silence them for the old duration.\n\nEDIT with some reasons why I like the idea:\n--------------------\n* If he wants the silence, it's a skillshot so counterplay is involved.\n* He cannot use his blink until his knife hits something or just disappears.\n* That delay both A) tells people he's about to jump and B) breaks his stealth before he actually jumps, although maybe the Ult blades should wait until he actually attacks or reactivates E before they shoot to him, so that he still does the same Ult damage\n* He can play mindgames by knifing the Malz, then blinking on Cait, trading the silence for unpredictability\n* One of his quotes says \"Oh, I lost another blade.

I feel like if it worked this way most talons would just do what they do now - blink on their target and kill them regardless of whether they hit the skillshot or not. \n\nI think a good way to do it would to remove the damage from the bleed portion of Q, and add it so that he instead instantly procs that damage if he E's on a target that he hit with the skillshot bit. The fact that the damage is now instantaneous means that you could nerf the damage a bit to keep it in line, or maybe you could just make it so E'ing on targets hit with the skillshot just causes the bleed instead. I don't really think having a bleed makes sense gameplay wise (assassins are about delivering instantaneous damage, not DoTs), but meh.","replies":[{"poster":"OblongOtter","date":"2015-02-05T02:58:56.184+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like it!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GaleWinUnleashed","date":"2015-02-05T02:23:08.664+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like how this adds counterplay while ALSO giving the ability strategic depth.

The current slow gives you enough time to throw in an extra auto attack.  Your combo's damage is stronger than before with that extra auto, especially once he has some AD.","replies":[{"poster":"JayenKei","date":"2015-02-05T19:08:00.469+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That extra autoattack is completely useless due to the passive being completely useless\nTake into consideration that the passive isn't applied to his q which sucks\nImagine this\n\nSay a talon goes around rakes somebody and does a 1k AUTOATTACK (meaning q is not used) crit (this is pretty unrealistic but just bear with me)\nMercy's passive gives Talon 10% more damage to someone that is basically cced.\nWith a 1k AA crit Talon gets an extra 100 damage...\nPeople over estimate how much extra damage he gets from that passive and I can assure you, it does close to nothing.

I feel like you people would just complain about anything lmao.\n\nWhat Talon needs is flexibility in gameplay, hes once again underpowered compared to most if not all Assassins in the game again after losing his silence. Yeah he was doing too good with his silence, but taking that out and replacing it with a 1 or less than second slow is a little too lazy isn't it? The fact that they even put that 3 second damage amplify is another sign of laziness, just why would you put another an extra damage dealt buff for 3 seconds on a blinked target?\n\nTalon also suffers for being one of the Champions in League to have a nearly useless Passive, it also doesn't affect with his Q, so that's already a problem that he has skills that doesn't affect the other skill, it's only 10% and it has to be a CC'd target so that's another problem. His Ult might look like it's his strongest ability, but what most people don't want to understand is that it's also his biggest weakness and relies deeply on it.\n\nTalon has so much kit and gameplay problems, that people don't seem to see or just completely ignore. It's so bad for Riot that their Balance team is notorious for ignoring Champions and biased towards what they think is cool, like it's so obvious they're scared to make changes that's needed for the game just because of self-serving bias and a \"certain\" outrage of \"people/players\". So sad.\n\nI just have to mention again, Talon has one of the worst Passive in this game.","replies":[{"poster":"JayenKei","date":"2015-02-05T19:09:46.297+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you...someone who understands Talon's garbage passive","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Hyrum Graff","date":"2015-02-05T19:08:35.862+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"[I'll just leave this here.](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/FBahQVHO-lets-talk-about-talon-he-can-have-a-healthy-silence-part-iii)","replies":[]}]}
