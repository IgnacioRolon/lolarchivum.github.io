This is different from the permanent Double Wolf glitch as a 3rd Wolf will spawn if the Double Wolf glitch is active. This only happens occasionally.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-09-18T23:31:19.418+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hiya! \n\nThanks for the report!

Even in Kindred's official board, there is no red response.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-09-28T22:29:31.390+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"While not every post may be replied to (I handle a lot of the PBE posts regarding skins), we do read through them all.
