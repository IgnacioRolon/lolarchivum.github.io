So i was going to uninstall and reinstall, but I can't access league of legends websites at all either. All that loads is the background image, I have no way to download league again. I had to use my phone to make this discussion, so what exactly can i do then? :( thanks for reading","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2018-01-05T22:45:12.894+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, it sounds like something is blocking you from reaching our sites or services.
