It&#039;s fantastic I must say but a little creepy aswell, so I thought that we might create a skin for him named Slenderman Jhin or Gentleman Jhin (the idea is to dress him with a smoking but keeping the mask on)  in order to combine his walking with some frightness :P\n\nThink about that!\n\nP.S. You probably already know Slender very well from the horror games or from the internet itself but I&#039;ve posted this link in case you don&#039;t know him at all. (There are versions with red tie or black tie, I think both of them suits well on Jhin)\n\nThank you for your time and consideration!","replies":[{"poster":"CHAAAAAAAAAAAAAA","date":"2016-02-29T05:46:49.608+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not really a fan of creepypastas, but this idea seems pretty fantastic.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RoyalSoul","date":"2016-02-04T17:23:13.680+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally I'd love to see a skin that resembles the Happy Mask Salesman from LoZ:MM","replies":[]},{"poster":"Riot Brightmoon","date":"2016-02-02T01:20:56.074+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The idea of a Gentleman Jhin is very cool, thanks for sharing it!","replies":[{"poster":"HyperlySarcastic","date":"2016-02-02T22:53:02.474+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot Brightmoon,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=0bAvg2zH,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-02-02T01:20:56.074+0000)\n>\n> The idea of a Gentleman Jhin is very cool, thanks for sharing it!\n\nWasnt Jhin Teased in Galio's Debanoir skin?

They'll turn his mask into clown makeup.\n\nThey can pull it off but only if they work HARD to make it not look tacky and make sure the colors on his costume aren't too extravagant. A dark looking clown isn't really a \"clown\" but it would be the only way to make it work imo without making him look like an utter idiot.\n\nFailing that, I think they would take it down a notch and give him a 750 skin where he's a carnival ref or something. With the tacky red and white pants. \n\nGod they have so many chances to fail with a Jhin skin. I really hope they don't.\n\nBack to the \"clown but not really clown\" idea, I'm imagining him having no mask, but his face being covered with makeup. A black line going down across one of his eyes to resemble a scar. A black star around his other eye. A black top hat, some kind of suit (OR A CLOAK or something similar to The Crow) and black lipstick. THAT would make it work *very* well imo.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"fazar8","date":"2016-02-02T01:35:03.754+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"maybe put it in the debonair skin line? his flowers would work try well with that","replies":[]},{"poster":"KipShroom","date":"2016-02-02T00:44:39.263+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i love this idea.
