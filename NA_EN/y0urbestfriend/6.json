When i select one it will have my previous one selected( even after I click done and the screen goes away) or it will select a random one but never the one that I want.\r\n\r\nFor example before Kindred had a new skin it was just her classic or Shadow Fire. If I click shadow fire then i get classic, and classic gets shadow fire sometimes! Now with Super Galaxy Kindred if i select that one I get Shadow fire, when I select shadow fire I get classic or Super Galaxy.\r\nThat's it for my client problem. ( I have uninstalled and use the repair tool without anything changing)\r\n\r\nMy next problem is in game when I play Jhin using his Highnoon skin.\r\nWhen someone hit an enemy or anything like that to put the marker for his W on that champion sometimes that marker will stay on the champ for the rest of the game or even a few champs and it makes it hard too know if they are actually marked for the root or not. I'm not sure what is causing this and I can upload documents or anything you need just let me know what todo and ill give you the logs. \r\n\r\nMy final problem has nothing todo with the game or client, I registered my League of Legends club I have with my school too Riot and I wanted too maybe check in on my request that i submitted but idk who to talk to or email or anything. \r\n\r\nThank you for taking your time to read this and please feel free to ask any other questions about my problems so I can maybe be more clear or provide extra information I do not know how to provide at this time. Thank you!!!","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-02T18:54:28.396+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is your skin selection issue consistent across all champions, or just specific ones? That's a pretty wild issue and I've certainly never heard of it before.\n\nThe issue you mention with Highnoon Jhin is actually something we've logged and are tracking. We're looking into a fix, but at this moment it's a known bug. \n\nFinally, a good place to inquire about the status of your University registration would be reaching out via email to **collegiate@riotgames.com**","replies":[{"poster":"Y0urBestFriend","date":"2016-08-03T02:22:14.878+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You are awesome thank you! As for the skin select its for every champion I have used in that mode, I do not own or use all the champions yet but so far its the same for the ones I got at the moment.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-03T15:44:30.155+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Got it. So based on your description of the issue, I believe it's possible that your game assets are corrupted in some way. If the client goes to request a specific asset (skin) and due to some files being way out of wack, it's possible that it would select the wrong skin entirely. Since it's a relatively simple task, I suggest [running a repair](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting#wq5) of your game files.\n\nLet me know if that causes any change for you. :)","replies":[{"poster":"Y0urBestFriend","date":"2016-08-03T22:39:15.211+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds good, Ill give that a try.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
