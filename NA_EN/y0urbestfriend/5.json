The player was about 12/3 on kills and deaths. Why is this allowed to happen? This player was reported but nothing seems to come of things like this and they will continue to-do things like this to other players. Please, if people start to-do things like this in person why do we have to lose LP for them purposely losing the game for us.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-09T01:20:22.189+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeeeeaaaaaa buying that many boots is definitely gonna give you a bad time. It's a good thing you reported them, as that's the best way to get our attention for those types of actions.
