I understand my summoners name but why Riot? Why my username? That seems shady to me. I was told I'd get the mystery skin but I do not want my account to be hacked and lose everything.\r\nI have included a link that should have three screen shots of all this info.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-12T21:33:16.027+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is legit!!  The information requested is to ensure that the content is being sent to the correct player, so there may be some doubling up for accuracy.  For example, if a username wasn't requested but you changed your summoner name at some point then that would suck!  The document will help with rolling out the rewards to eligible accounts by the provided date.  Hope that helps bring some ease!","replies":[{"poster":"Y0urBestFriend","date":"2016-10-13T00:46:26.019+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok cool! Thank you so much!
