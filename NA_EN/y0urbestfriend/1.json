It keeps saying 502 Bad Gateway. Plus when I click on login the link at the top in the address bar gets really long and seems to go on forever with a bunch on random stuff. Anyone know what is going on? I have tried this on several browsers. {{item:3632}}","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-22T23:17:20.742+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your browser or some extension on it might be causing problems.
