May it be kit suggestions, appearance of the next coming Bilgewater rat, personality types you would enjoy, story hooks which should be explored..... the possibilities are endless.\n\nOnly restriction I am asking for is that we please focus on ideas centered around Bilgewater.\nAnd now, I will make use of my privilege and start with my own ideas for archetypes I would like to see.\n\n_______________________________________________________\n\n**Leash of the Beast**\nWe read alot in the lore about sea serpents and other dangerous creatures living in the depth of Bilgewater&#039;s seas. Yet, we don&#039;t have a champion directly tied with them, the closest we got is Illaoi as the priestess of Nagakabouros. I would like a champion, who was able to _tame_ such a creature and using it for battle. I imagine a top lane vanguard, with a gigantic creature (for example: a crab), commanding it. The crab itself has alot of CC and scales with his defensive stats, but the guy himself is pretty vulnerable. For his ult, he is able to mount the creature, turning off his weakness of having a vulnerable tamer.\n\n**Pirate Yordle**\nMany regions in the game got yordles, who kinda represent the ideals of their place.\nZaun got Ziggs, Piltover has Heimerdinger on their salary list, Kennen fights for balance in Ionia, Poppy doesn&#039;t notice that she is the hero of Demacia, Kled forbids trespassing in Noxus aaaaaand so on.\nBilgewater is lacking such a charismatic hamster, the Yordle should be a thief or cutthroad, worthy to be a sign of Gangplanks home.\nI could even imagine that he/she (we need females) has some visual similarities with wharf rats.\n\n**The Ahab**\nA champion with a beastly nemesis, he lost everything that had any meaning for him because of this creature and will not rest until he killed it. I could imagine an aquatic void creature filling that role. I imagine him to be a jungler, wandering around looking for the beast (especially in the river).\n\n__________________________________________________\n\nThese were some ideas from me, but you guys probably have something way more interesting to share.\nI hope for a great discussion.","replies":[{"poster":"GreenLore","date":"2017-10-17T17:30:36.496+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah we really need at least one Bilgewater champ who commands some kind of sea beast(even if said sea beast would likely be ult-exclusive).I mean the serpent callers look like they are essentially Bilgewaters secret weapon.\n\nThough I disagree on the yordle a bit,since \"pirate\" is essentially gangplanks theme already,so if we'd introduce a yordle to Bilgewater I'd argue that he/she should not be a pirate,but rather something else(heck said yordle could be your Ahab-champ)\n\n\nOthers I'd like to see:\n\n**An Admiral**\nNow with MF trying to reduce the amount of criminals in Bilgewater,it would be cool to actually get a non-pirate-seafarer.He/she could either look surprisingly clean for Bilgewater(think of someone like Norrington from pirates of the caribbean),possibly being  a rogue admiral from demacia,or he/she could be more similar to the rogue-admiral-garen skin.\n\n\n**More Marine-animal based Vastaya(or otherwise half-human-hybrids)**\nSo far we only really have 2 champs who are based on marine animals with {{champion:267}} &{{champion:105}} and thats kind of a shame since there are so many different creatures below the sea,like octopi(no Vel'koz isn't an octopus just because he has tentacles),angler fish,sharks,crabs,etc.","replies":[{"poster":"Chembaron Yamada","date":"2017-10-17T17:36:25.595+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"A Demacian guy coming to Bilgewater as some kind of admiral and trying to hold up Demacia's moral standards could be really fun.\n\nImagine him saying to his crew \"make him speak\", then they proceed to skin the victim alive and he is like \"What are you doing? I imagined putting him in a dark room, let a lamp shine in his face and ask questions?!\"\n\nThe Makara mentioned in the vastaya lore update were a great opportunity for your marine vastaya idea.","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2017-10-17T21:31:07.987+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Like the [Rogue Admiral Garen](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/1/1b/Garen_RogueAdmiralSkin.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20170615220302) skin?
