I would personally enjoy if such a champion would wield a weapon that seems less elegant, like the flail that Rem is using. Weight shouldn&#039;t really be a factor here, since Hextech exists and these are even able to manipulate time. So maybe a flail that she can change the weight of at will through hextech?\n\n__________________________\n\n**Lore and Personality**\n\nI think this could be something that we didn&#039;t see before. If we are looking at the champion roster, there are alot of strong, independant characters.\nWhat a maid could bring to the table here is a completely submissive personality. She could be the servant of a lord in Piltover, and while she is a really talented fighter, she just lives to serve her master. \n\nShe is willing to do everything for her house, including crimes like murder. She doesn&#039;t have another purpose in life and just wants to be useful. Perhaps it could even go as far as a nihilistic personality, she has no motivation to do anything without an order.\n\nThe champions we have from Piltover until now are all scientists, part of the police department or generally more upper class.\nTaking a look at the servants of this city could be quite interesting in my opinion.\n\n__________________________\n\nI would like to see what the community thinks of this, should a maid be an archetype represented in League of Legends?\nOr am I really alone with that wish? :(","replies":[{"poster":"Kelg","date":"2018-07-15T18:26:53.698+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:81}} Weaboos...

We can be a bit more creative here.\nLook at one of the examples I gave, for reference.\n\nRem is a strong fighter on the battlefield with demonic strength and using a heavy flail.\nhttps://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/vsbattles/images/d/d5/Rem_mace.png/revision/latest?cb=20160917132154\nHere, so you get an imagination from her weapon.\n\nA maid champion could possibly be a jungler (\"working in the hidden background\") with an assassin or mage playstyle.\nOr she could be a mid laner (having to manage the game like a maid manages the household?).\nWhile a support playstyle would make sense, you can as well give her another playstyle by stretching the theme in another direction.\n\nPyke is an assassin played in the support role, yet his lore is one of a ghost serial killer. At first, it doesn't seem fitting, since he is a ghost out for revenge and doesn't work together with others for this in his lore. But he used to be a hunter for leviathans, something that is always done with a crew supporting each other. With that stretch, it can make sense.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Leyruh","date":"2018-07-15T18:10:44.713+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Having a maid could be cool. After all, like you said, we already have champions that represent different aspects of Piltover.\n\n{{champion:164}}, the aristocracy.\n{{champion:51}}, the peace keeper.\n\nAnd so on. \n\nHowever, what bothers me is the archetype thing. I think it'd be better if she was the kind of maid that you don't often see.\n\nI'll take {{champion:497}} as an example.\n\nHe is called \"The Charmer\". Everyone expected him to have a flirty behavior and a seducing tone.\n\nRakan is none of that. He's loud. He's narcissistic. He acts and says dumb things.\n\nHe's awesome. \n\nI know a lot of people were disappointed when they discovered his personality, because they expected something different from a Champion nicknamed \"The Charmer\".\n\nIf a Maid Champion is to be created by Riot, I want them to do the same thing. Something we don't expect but is awesome.\n\nHowever, since I don't have a lot of knowledge about maid characters in any type of media, I can't really say what would be \"original\" from the archetype.\n\nWell, I guess I can say what she shouldn't be. :o\n\nShe shouldn't be the submissive type without reason. If she is willing to do anything for her Lord/Lady, it should be because of her lore. Perhaps her Lord/Lady did something for them in the past and she deems it necessary to make up for it by doing anything they wish.\n\nBut what I'm saying is kinda cliche too. For instance, the \"Someone saved me in the past so I will do anything for them\" is very unoriginal.\n\nI'll try thinking about a possible lore for a maid, because right now, I don't have that much to suggest you. xD","replies":[{"poster":"Chembaron Yamada","date":"2018-07-15T18:51:15.296+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I get your point that we should spice up the idea a bit.\nBit sad, since I really think we could use a submissive champion at this point (not everyone has to be that cool acting hero), but you may have a point here.\n\nMaybe it could get flipped upside down a bit. In public, the maid behaves like a loyal servant at the side of the master. But secretly, she is blackmailing him and has control over his house herself and is oppressing him like some kind of dominatrix. >:)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Darius Strada","date":"2018-07-15T18:42:58.926+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:76}} +skin.","replies":[{"poster":"Chembaron Yamada","date":"2018-07-15T18:47:42.182+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"At least in my opinion, just because a champion has such a skin shouldn't rule out the theme as a base for a champion.\nFor example, we have Elementalist Lux.
