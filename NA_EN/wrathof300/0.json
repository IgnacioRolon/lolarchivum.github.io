Personally I don&#039;t mind Neeko being of the former, and I think the &quot;she&#039;s a Vastayshai&#039;rei&quot; argument is a weak one, because making her design more animal-like still does nothing to distinguish her from **regular vastaya** such as Rengar. The &quot;she can shape-shift hence she more human now&quot; argument, while more reasonable it is equally as flawed. \nFrom what I gathered the main difference between Neeko and the regular Vastaya are her shape shifting abilities and the presence of flower petals on her head and tail, but I digress.\n\n****\n\nWhat I want to suggest is that if you really want a &quot;Chameleon Neeko&quot;, we petition to have Riot create a more &quot;Chameleon&quot; version of Neeko that can be toggled between that and her humanoid form, her being a shape-shifter it would make sense if she canonically had multiple 'original' appearances. Perhaps it just changes her face and some textures, but if you really want to see even a slightly more chameleon version of Neeko its worth the discussion imo.","replies":[{"poster":"WAAARGHbobo","date":"2018-12-05T21:24:40.230+0000","up_votes":25,"down_votes":0,"body":"To clarify.

Like, this seems to imply that their form is largely based on their subconscious mind, and that most could theoretically change their appearance to a much higher level than they currently do, but that it'd require either an deep deep understanding of ones own mind or some other sort of mental training. Now if this is the case what would a Vastayan with split personalities or some other similar mental condition look like. It'd be really neat to see a champ who could like form swap between two personalities, sure Kayn and Gnar sort of already touch on this but I feel like there's still plenty of room here for something really neat. Like maybe have some sort of in game conditions that would trigger the change outside of what we're used to. Maybe they could have something like a fear of groups and so being around more than one champ causes them to shift into a different form, sure Kha'zix kinda already plays around this but make them a laner and it could be really cool. Maybe they have like tank disengage qualities in groups, and more fighter/diver qualities solo, could be fun to try and balance around top/support as their main roles and would make them a really unique flex pick.
