ONLY LEAGUE DOES IT. I've updated my drivers, tried Legacy Client, tried Beta Client. My computer will FREEZE while playing League. Sometimes it happens after a few games, some times after a marathon of them. Is there anybody that might be able to help figure this out?\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/N8xgc4u.png\n\nNo clue how to delve deeper into this.

I have already run through all the guides available from Riot's Support page but this problem persists with no way to figure out what causes it, if it's one repeating failure or multiple. But all logical inference from experience points to some incompatibility between League and some Windows operation. I was able to play WoW in same or longer sessions with no issues. I've turned the \"Share\" feature of nVidia and will go a few days to see if maybe that was the reason. But after that, I don't know what else could be causing it, especially since this is the only game I've experience problems with.","replies":[]}]}]}
