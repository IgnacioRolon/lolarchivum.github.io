It's gotten down to 7 days now which is really stressing me out. Especially since i just got plat yesterday. Was hoping to find people with similar problems here, but i didn't find any. Would like to know if anyone is having the same issue though.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-30T22:00:51.703+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Make sure that you're playing a game in all the queues that could be decaying. You might be playing Solo matches when it's your Flex rank that's getting ready to decay!","replies":[{"poster":"Yupin","date":"2017-08-30T22:08:10.366+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah that was the problem.
