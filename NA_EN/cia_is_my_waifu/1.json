There&#039;s already been math run on how the overrall healing is weaker and now restricted to champions, Vlad never did outheal damage in team fights, he just bounced back up by CSing a minion wave or jungle camp between fights. Now he&#039;s encouraged to act like Darius and walk in with that condtional Q to bait someone with low health.\n\n\nBut Darius already does that, and he does it better at about the same range no less, Vlad&#039;s enpowered Q scaled with 5% missing health+2.5% per 100ap, thats 17.5% missing health in a 500AP build which is probably more than youre going to see in an average build now that such heavy health scaling is tied to his E while basic Q isnt even worthwhile.\n\n\nMeanwhile Darius Q heals for 12% missing health per target up to a maximum of 36% at all levels.  These are both conditional mid range abilities. Darius&#039;s conditions are just easier. The argument of melee can&#039;t even be made as they&#039;re both front line and close range.\n\n\nWhat&#039;s the deal riot? You&#039;re turning my favorite champion into a &quot;drain tank&quot; that you seem to be so fond of, and yet he&#039;s even outclassed at that.  We don&#039;t want a tank, we want a carry mage who scales into an amazing late game. His healing has never been a factor in team fights, hextech has always been forced into our hands due to hefty health costs on E, now you&#039;ve taken away consistency in favor of this &quot;ooh look at the big numbers&quot; chargeable ability. The new E is terrible and I&#039;d be more than happy to tell you why.\n\n\n1. Huge health costs\n2. 1 second charge time that effects both base damage and ap ratio\n3. Can be interrupted by CC  (Im pretty sure even roots will stop it which is silly)\n4. Projectiles are blocked by minions and champions, the closer you are, the more projectiles will be blocked, there is a band-aid fix for this against minions as it was so terrible for CSing they couldnt ship it as is.\n5. The animation doesnt match the projectile, max ranging it will miss every time\n6. Highly telegraphed much like Crimson Rush\n7. Self Slow\n\nI&#039;m not going to get into the rest of the changes yet as I&#039;m on a work break and only have so much time to type this up, but Riot I impore you to reconsider the changes made to this kit. You could salvage it by keeping E&#039;s animation and making it passthrough, removing the charge time and rebalancing the damage acrossed his kit.  The healing on hemoplague? Great idea, but there were much better ways to go about making his kit interactive.","replies":[]}
