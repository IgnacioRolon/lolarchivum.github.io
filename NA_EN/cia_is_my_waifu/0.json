So let me give you some background.\r\n\r\n1. My Framerate is solid and stays around 60FPS at all times at low settings on my i7's built in graphics.\r\n2. I download and record a replay in the league client\r\n3. I watch the webm file with windows media player classic\r\n4. Scrubbing the video crashes MPC\r\n5. My in game FPS now drops to 20FPS intermittently, both of my hard drives folders now endlessly load, and restarting doesn't fix the problem.\r\n\r\nI have never had this problem with any video editing software like Premiere when saving and viewing videos, or media software until I tried to view a replay. The very first time it happened before the first reinstall I had tried to cut and paste the video file to my desktop  after watching it and the same behavior started. This time I was careful and made a copy for fear this would happen again, and lo and behold here we are.\r\n\r\nSo if any of you have an inkling on why this might be happening please let me know.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-27T22:46:16.413+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's an interesting situation, though I think we're missing some context on what else you've tried to do in order to fix this, other than copying the file and reinstalling your OS.

I'm assuming it has something to do with video codec files.  Like I can view the webms fine in the player as long as I don't scrub, I can view them in my browser fine too.  If I scrub in the browser I'll get a message saying the video file is corrupt even though it plays fine if I leave it alone.\n\nThe real problem is that I now have consistent FPS drops in everything I do, even games other than league. And my windows folders load indefinitely. \nAs In: I click my computer and I get something like [this](https://imgur.com/a/GeNtm) forever.  But if I can open a folder directly from the desktop, the start menu, etc I can access them just fine.  \n\nAnd all 3 times that this happened were after recording and viewing a replay webm. Before reinstalling I \n1. ran a full scan with malwarebytes. (No results)\n2. Checked for rootkits with TDSSkiller (Nothing)\n3. Tried rebuilding the index\n4. gave up, formatted my drive and reinstalled windows.\n\nAlso, I forgot to mention this but it's probably related. The first time after I had tried to move one of the files, explorer started to hang as well. When I ended the task, instead of the usual simple restart of the explorer.exe task, it kept giving an error saying \"The remote procedure call failed and did not execute\" There was no getting explorer working again short of restarting.\n\nEdit: Forgot to mention, yes other video files seem to load and scrub perfectly with no problems.\n\nDouble Edit: Killing the DLLhost process seems to allow folders to load again. Could this be bad DLL files?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-03-01T02:55:50.574+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So none of these symptoms that affect other games or Windows tasks happen if you **aren't** also viewing a **.webm** highlight video at the same time?","replies":[{"poster":"Cia Is My Waifu","date":"2017-03-01T09:30:46.858+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Targons Blade,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=vNd5KIiK,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2017-03-01T02:55:50.574+0000)\n>\n> So none of these symptoms that affect other games or Windows tasks happen if you **aren&#x27;t** also viewing a **.webm** highlight video at the same time?\n\nAlright, I replicated it just now. \n1. Recorded a few clips in 2 different replays\n2. Opened up the highlights folder and selected them\n3. Cut command\n4. Infinite loading bar begins first in this folder and is fine everywhere else.\n5. exiting the folder and reloading it shows the files as unknown types rather than the usual MPC thumbnails.\n6. Opening them in MPC and scrubbing causes MPC to crash as usual.\n7. Reloaded the folder again, the infinite loading begins again.\n8. Now the infinite loading also affects 'my computer' but clicking another folder like the C or D drive will open fine and snappy.\n9. DLLhost.exe has appeared in my task manager after being absent prior to when we first went to the highlights folder and is consuming around 12-13% CPU for the moment\n10. Killing the process while the highlight folder is open and loading doesn't work, DLLhost.exe just shows up again immediately.\n11. Closing the highlights folder and killing DLLhost.exe causes everything to run normally.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-03-01T22:11:57.777+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah, so you're experiencing these symptoms completely out of League, then.

It's definitely an issue with the converted files in particular since it's interacting with them specifically is the only thing that causes it. I think I'm close to figuring it out in full, and i'll update here if I find a complete solution. \n\nFor anyone who is experience this, here's the temp solution: \n1. Make sure none of the corrupted replay webms are on the desktop. If you can't delete them, do it in safe mode, also close the highlights folder.\n2. Open task manager and look for DLLHOST.exe, and explorer.exe, check their CPU usage, if explorer is above 50% restart your computer and it should go back to normal as long as you don't open the highlights folder or you will have to restart again.\n3. Sometimes you can get away with just closing DLLhost.exe via end process, or end process tree. But in my experience it reopened itself a bunch.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Cia Is My Waifu","date":"2017-03-01T10:12:47.179+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've got another update for you. I found a thread that pretty much describes exactly what's going on [here](http://www.overclock.net/t/817913/dllhost-exe-com-surrogate-high-cpu-load/10)\n\nI've since tested with a bunch of seperate webms and they all play and scrub fine. \n1. Open League highlights folder\n2. the infinite loading begins and explorer.exe starts chugging all the way up to 50% CPU\n3. try opening highlight webm and scrub, and it crashes immediately\n4.Explorer is now at 73-75% CPU\n5. DLLhost.exe hasn't appeared this time, and explorer continues to take the huge CPU load.\n\nIt seems to be related to windows trying to either interpret the thumbnails or the video codec and sees the converted files as corrupt or something. I also now realize the reason this issue was persistent upon restarts before is because I had previously pasted my replay webms to my desktop, which is a folder that's constantly loaded on startup.","replies":[]}]}
