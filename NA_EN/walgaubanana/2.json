Once you get level 6, it's the moment zed becomes very strong and can kill people ( you cant point every good atribute that zed has to make him BS ,that has no sense ). But dont worry, he will still be BS, because after 5 mins, mid will get zhonya, adc qss AND THE OTHERS WILL CC YOU, how the fck can u deal with an assassin when u cant even kill one guy in ennemy team ???
