I haven't left a game let alone a champion selection since the first time i played, i'm level 31 now so that was a long while ago. \r\n\r\nDuring the past week of playing lol I have been in a champion selection where someone would have left before the game started which put me back in queue, this happened about 3/4 times. The block said that leaving the champion selection screen can cause the block, so why did it block me when i haven't left anything since i was level 3?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-08T02:05:53.529+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're getting a low priority queue after leaving champion select multiple times, it's likely that your account ended up getting hit with leaverbuster/afk penalties. It kinda sounds like your champ select was timing out from your network connection timing out, so I'd be sure to check over some general network troubleshooting with the [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues).","replies":[]}]}
