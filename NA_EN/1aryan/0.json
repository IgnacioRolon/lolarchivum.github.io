(It's mostly in English, some Polish parts might be there, but I think It won't be a problem).\n I posted DXDIAG on some upload webside   (if it's suspicious, and it can be, please inform me how to add files to post directly).\nI followed optymalization steps (found some big post on forum), but still can't play. What causes that? I literally optymalized EVERYTHING.\nThere must me some other problem, dunno where, I would really apreciate any help.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-04T22:52:19.697+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Most FPS problems are caused by display driver issues, windows power settings, or corrupt/missing game assets.
