I really can't stand the USA hate that I see on the internet lately. We are insulted daily for our Presidential nominees, our foreign policy, our health care system, and virtually every other aspect of our life, and honestly, it's pathetic. First of all, anyone who says  our politics is either corrupt or otherwise stupid needs to take a long hard look at England right now. THAT'S stupid politics, and even people that voted for Brexit are now regretting it. As for our foreign policy issues, half of them are problematic because we as a nation have made it our priority to bail the rest of the world out of virtually every conflict for the past century. If not for our \"meddling\" the world would be a very shitty place indeed. Not saying that everything the US has done is right, but the world is a damn sight better with us than without. And finally, the health care hate. As an aspiring medical student, this is where I am most knowledgeable, as preparing for med school interviews requires me to be at least reasonably well versed on issues like this. For those of you who are in a socialized health care system, please answer this question: how long does it take you to see a specialist for a non-critical condition (ie elective surgery)? If your answer is anything other than \"a really long time\" you are either lying or you are delusional. In the US, if you are diagnosed with something that is classified as non-critical (let's say, a hernia that is NOT life threatening and not causing horrendous amounts of pain/discomfort) you will likely have it taken care of within a month or less. In a purely socialized system, you will be lucky to have it surgically repaired within 3 months. Our system is MUCH better in this regard. Fully socialized health care is obviously better in terms of more people having insurance coverage, but here in the US, we are attempting to merge the best of both systems. Is it the perfect health care system? Of course not, but it works pretty well most of the time.","replies":[{"poster":"billxx","date":"2016-07-28T21:19:33.196+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean it's not like a single injury can destroy your life if you can't pay for it, or how America has thousands of murders a year, an that's just guns.

No other country has our racial issues because no other country has our level of diversity. Also, for the record, racism is perpetuated by a vocal minority, and is NOT institutionalized as many people think. The whole police targeting black people thing that has been going on lately has quite honestly been blown WAY out of proportion by the media. The police are not racist. A few individual police offers are either just horrible people and/or overreacted to a situation. Not trying to belittle the suffering of the victims, but to blame institutional racism for this does nothing but incite anger and resentment for our police force that is filled with mostly good people trying to do their job as justly as possible. \n\nAs for the gun problem, you really are missing the point if you believe that it's a gun problem. It's a problem with people who simply do not understand the value of life. There are plenty of gun nuts out there who collect guns, hunt, shoot for sport, etc. that would NEVER hurt anyone. Should their rights be taken away due to the actions of a few psychopaths? Also the main issue with gun control here is that to \"outlaw\" or even severely restrict gun ownership would require that the second amendment be repealed. In the US Constitution, the first 10 amendments are called the Bill of Rights, and they were the basic freedoms that formed the building blocks of our government and legal system that were originally written to prevent oppression akin to the English monarchy from which we won our independence. To repeal or otherwise alter one of these amendments would set a dangerous precedent that our basic freedoms could be changed or taken away, and people are afraid of that.\n\nAnd as for starting wars for the economy, if you honestly believe that there has ever been a war that was not at least partly motivated by economic reasons, you need to go back to your high school world history class. Every war in human history has been fought for the acquisition of resource or other economic reasons. There may be other driving forces, but money is always a big one. Also, let's be totally honest here, regardless of our reasons for the war in Iraq, Saddam Hussein was a dickwad that needed to be ousted before he killed even more innocent people. You really can't get rid of people like him without armed conflict, it's an unfortunate necessity that occurs when greedy people get too obsessed with power.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2016-07-28T09:25:33.701+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really hope he isn't.\n\n\n\nAlso, *you're","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Monsieur Kast","date":"2016-07-29T10:16:19.544+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"MonkeyMadness","date":"2016-08-02T07:14:25.331+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">And what do you exactly mean with this?\n\nI mean that had the US not entered into the European theater in WW2, either Nazi Germany or Soviet Russia would have take over all of Europe. The reason that this didn't happen was that the US came in and forced Germany to divide its forces across two fronts (easy and west), which lead to the \"race to Berlin\" between the US and our EUW allies from the western front and the Soviet Union from the easy. So that removed Nazi Germany from the equation, and the fact that we ended up splitting Germany between easy and west Europe stopped the Soviets from expanding the Iron Curtain further west.\n\nAnd I'm not \"proud\" of my nation. I have no control over where I was born, I prefer to be proud of things that I've personally accomplished. For example, I'm proud that I graduated college Suma Cum Laude. I'm NOT proud that I happened to be born in a certain country, and honestly I feel that pride in one's race, ethnicity, nationality, sex/gender, sexual orientation, etc is something that should be discouraged, as it can only lead to conflict. NO ONE has an ounce (<--- huehuehue dumbass 'murican units, pardon the expression) of control over ANY of these things, and really have no choice but to embrace it. \n\nBut I digress; I am being open minded, but I'm also being objective. The US is highly ranked in terms of education,  health care, and certain other metrics by which one could classify a country as a \"good place to live\". We may not be the top of those lists, but the US certainly offers a very well-rounded package. However, we are (and have been for years) at the top of the GDP rankings. Even though our economy has gone to relative shit in the past decade or so, we still have the best one IN THE WORLD.\n\nNow, I completely understand that this issue is not really an objective one. There are a lot of subjective factors to consider. But, if you want to continue this debate (which I will gladly do) please give some reasons why the US is not such a good place to live and/or why EUW is better, and we can go from there. I feel as though I have largely been on the defensive since I made my original statement, and I'd like it if someone else had to justify their opinions instead of me being forced to do so with mine.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Maximum Morde","date":"2016-07-28T15:40:55.171+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Texas in the winter, Colorado in the Summer obviously.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BloodyTompon","date":"2016-07-28T08:14:25.201+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Iran","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Whut Thuh ","date":"2016-07-27T17:12:00.311+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":12,"body":"except that he did it without realizing the funds required and baught expensive imports like windmills and aircraft from switzerland and the fact that obama care has put hospitals aarp and medicare insurers in serious financial stress due to the overwhelming cost that has to be paid by fewer and fewr taxpayers since food stamps and unemployement benefits are worth more than a starting pay at mc donalds. so why work when you can get more money for doing absolutely nothing.\n\n\ndonald trump supporter- signing out","replies":[{"poster":"Epitome of Noob","date":"2016-07-27T17:24:09.459+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Mattboy2000,realm=NA,application-id=Ir7ZrJjF,discussion-id=AA27w9AV,comment-id=0000000100020000,timestamp=2016-07-27T17:12:00.311+0000)\n>\n> except that he did it without realizing the funds required and baught expensive imports like windmills and aircraft from switzerland and the fact that obama care has put hospitals aarp and medicare insurers in serious financial stress due to the overwhelming cost that has to be paid by fewer and fewr taxpayers since food stamps and unemployement benefits are worth more than a starting pay at mc donalds. so why work when you can get more money for doing absolutely nothing.\n> \n> \n> donald trump supporter- signing out\n\nThe solution, of course, is to remove unemployment benefits, rather than raise the minimum wage.

A company will only charge what people will pay, and that means they can never charge an obscene price for something basic like foodstuff.
