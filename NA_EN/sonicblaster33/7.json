Am I prepared to go even or lose without ganks? Are the other lanes safe to gank with my team?\"if 2 out of the three last questions is answered with \"No\" playing TF is gonna be a bitch/not a good idea.\n\nUnless you get ganks mid you're most likely going to have to rely on TP ganks, which is your specialty, but good jungle rotations and counter ganks can shut you down. It's usually fun and worth it, but the KILL LANES WILL END YOU!\n\n{{champion:99}} {{champion:238}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:63}} \n\nThese champions (and many others) make lane an incredibly difficult balance between Csing and feeding. Which is where the question \"How much shit am I willing to deal with in lane?\" comes in. These lane matchups are bad, but TF doesn't win his lane, he wins game. If you can put up with their shit you can do some great things for your team.\n\nhttp://66.media.tumblr.com/c8f04cc217319ba55d3b1054bac5dc65/tumblr_o3fys4Vi921sdy2pwo1_500.gif","replies":[{"poster":"Muddafragot","date":"2016-11-29T09:23:58.839+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> you can do some great things for your team.\n\nLike, yellow card...and that's it, that's the champion.","replies":[{"poster":"Jet Sett","date":"2016-11-29T20:37:48.080+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You also have an AOE slow that can open up more than one target to an engage from your team, wave clear to defend objectives, semi-reliable poke, and map pressure for your team that can help with securing other objectives.\n\nBut yes, the Gold Card is a major part of his kit that allows him to assist his team.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"5000000000000000","date":"2016-11-29T05:59:39.188+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What I do is add nice players (not necessarily playing well, but just being a nice person) from matchmade games, and play with them if I know I'm gonna suck hard.\nOr play with irl friends, but nobody who plays League has those.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Rakvir","date":"2016-11-29T02:34:39.001+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been with people who claimed to be streamers and YouTubers of some sort or another but, FUNNILY ENOUGH, when they give me the link to their video channels, these games -never- get posted, mysteriously enough.\n\n/sarcasm off","replies":[]},{"poster":"blueberrypancake","date":"2016-11-29T00:49:00.448+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I once trolled this guy with an amateur gold jungling stream by playing Taric top (pre-rework) and he was playing Zac\n\nLets just say the enemy top got screwed over \n\nThen I supported this one-trick ADC TF (one of those gods of silver) who apparently had a stream where only 1 person watched and he somehow got super fed.\n\n~~Close enough~~","replies":[]},{"poster":"Big Daddy Husk","date":"2016-11-28T23:31:13.184+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Played with Meteos on my team vs Imaqtpie and Annie bot...this was when flex que first started and I somehow managed to get D5 in flex que, the same as my regular ranked que.
