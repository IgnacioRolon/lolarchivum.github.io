I can only invite a single person on my friend list to games.\n2. The problem is the same for this friend, he can only invite me.\n3. It doesn't matter how I send the invite or which queue I'm in (suggested, from FL, or from the invite box), the invite simply isn't sent to anyone except this one person.\n4. We both tried relogging and the problem has persisted.\n5. Tried playing a game then hitting play again and inviting from that lobby, problem persisted.\nEdit: Going to try client repair, will update with new results.\n\nUpdate:\n6. Repaired client, problem has persisted.\nUpdate:\n7. Invites work on my Latin America North account.\n8. Can only invite the same friend on my second North America account. (One of the people I attempted to invite on this account was banned, and the system informed me of it, saying said person could not be invited, but of course, none of the other invites went all of the way through).\n\n(I originally posted this in /bug-report, but feel it belongs here, so I have copy/pasted and removed the original post)\n\nEdit: Parenthetical on 8.\n\nUpdate:\n9. Can now invite five of the people on my friend list, but the vast majority still do not receive invites.\n10. The list of people I can invite is the same on my second NA account, note - none of them are on that one's friend list.","replies":[{"poster":"sKz Aaron D","date":"2017-10-31T16:15:08.798+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, friend lives two time zones away, and we also have different internet service providers.
