I&#039;m planning to do a gender bend cosplay of her and I was just wondering what the clothing she wears is called and if there was a male equivalent. Thanks!\n\nBeforehand I was gonna copy Hanzo from Overwatch&#039;s clothing and just chalk it up to artistic expression before I found out he was actually wearing clothing that a Japanese archer would wear which makes me kind of want to shy away from that.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2018-03-20T16:27:27.888+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey! \n\nSo, there isn't any specific piece of clothing that we based this off of, which isn't super helpful for you. ;-; I'd be happy to grab you some in-game screen shots if you'd like, if that'll help you bring Blood Moon Diana to life. ^^","replies":[{"poster":"sinZsoul","date":"2018-03-23T01:40:29.767+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"XD o dratz. I actually saw a lot of good screenshots in the other thread that was discussing the Diana tattoo. If there was one thing that could help, it would probably be a flat view of her curved blade so I can accurately draw the dimensions.\n\nThanks for responding btw ^^!","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2018-03-23T17:14:30.208+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Happy to!
