So, I&#039;m looking for some feed back.\r\n    I&#039;m a new player and have only played a few Ranked here and there. However, I&#039;ve always thought it would be a great idea to have the ability to vote them off the island.\r\n\r\n    Example:\r\n    Your &quot;SUP&quot; has chosen {{champion:427}}  or for the Role of SUP {{champion:222}}  and though the whole team is saying in the champ select chat to please chose a real SUP role i.e..{{champion:117}} .. Yet they insist on selecting the ADC {{champion:236}} champ anyways.. Or you get an ADC role that has selected {{champion:76}} , I mean really? I&#039;m new and all but dude.. really?\r\n\r\n    This has happened a few times. Hey, I find some &quot;Meta&#039;s&quot; interesting and all, but in a ranked? Lets be real..... it&#039;s crap. But what do I know?\r\n\r\n    What say you Summoner?","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-12-13T10:26:39.011+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I feel like that would lead to more toxic situations than it would prevent.\n\nIf their intention is to troll then they will just do it with another champ. If they legitimately want to play the champ in that lane then they will probably be upset that they are being told they cant and are more likely to flame or troll afterwards.\n\nAlso, I would rather have an adc Nid that has a general idea of what she is doing than an Adc Lucian that has no clue what to do.","replies":[{"poster":"CGrandy","date":"2017-12-14T00:19:40.026+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Quote: \"Also, I would rather have an adc Nid that has a general idea of what she is doing than an Adc Lucian that has no clue what to do.\"\n\nHow do you know they have a general idea? Nid ADCis a horrible idea.. plain and simple.","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-12-14T06:10:39.187+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not really, she has poke, mobility, an attack speed steroid, and a heal to help her through early game.\n\nI assume they are more comfortable playing Nid than Lucian because they are picking her.

If it’s allowed in normals (not that OP is suggesting it should be, seems to be a ranked only thing) then 4 mans can abuse it. Not to mention a troll could throw up a vote just to mess with people. \n\n\nOh. And people would use it as a free dodge. Yeah, that’s a big one.","replies":[{"poster":"CGrandy","date":"2017-12-14T00:13:41.868+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"But if they use it as a free dodge; what would they be dodging for? Had to go? Need to use the restroom? Important Phone call? Mommy is calling? All reasons to not be stuck in a ranked game and \"AFK\" which would hurt everyone's LP.  Now, if they pick the \"wrong\" champ for their role (looking to get this free dodge) and get a loss as a result, then trying to use it as a free dodge wouldn't work that well. I do see your point, I just don't think it would be used as a \"free\" dodge as many times as you might think. We are talking about ranked. Also, there are a lot of Bronze trolls that do this and it's result is a loss. I find it difficult to get out of Bronze do to team trolling. Is this how it always is in all ranks?\n\nHowever, Wouldn't it be better to have an out that everyone can agree on by simply saying \"Hey guys & gals, I'm sorry I really got to go, please vote me off the team\" With no penalty anytime you get voted off.\n\nWhy would a three man team abuse it? it only delays their game more, no I don't think that would happen. Who really plays Flex ranked anyway and why? Ranking will be another comment for the Summoners I wilt start soon.\n\nTo reply to your \"troll abuse/mess with ppl\" comment. I would be happy to start the vote for that troll that has no grounds for the vote start. Those \"players\" would be an easy spot.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Gives No Lux","date":"2017-12-14T07:00:21.581+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally I've found you need to dodge anytime someone says 'don't play that champ'  or  'no, pick a tank.'
