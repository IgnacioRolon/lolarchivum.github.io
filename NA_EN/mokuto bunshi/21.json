Here's why","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":2,"down_votes":5,"body":"I have been looking for a ranked game that displays this well enough. I finally got one.\n\nThe counter to Cho&#039;gath is supposed to be that he can be kited.\nBut, he is currently strong enough that having champs that kite and siege counter siege aren&#039;t enough even with peel.\nhttp://i.imgur.com/RvzLmzF.jpg\nhttp://i.imgur.com/6zkODrN.jpg\nhttp://i.imgur.com/DU2MM0K.jpg\n\n\nOur Azir and Cho&#039;gath did great and apply LOTS of damage but as you can see by the pics. He took the most damage (not mitigated, face tanked :P) did the most damage on his team (despite our Azir hitting him HARD with Chogath) And he did this by building tank and what looked like a trolly mejais. With his dead mans he would just keep moving forward till they were sieging and smashing down towers. Take this as you like. I think hes gonna get another tweak come next Tuesday. Or at least he SHOULD. I Don&#039;t know what contributes to all what he can do in his kit, but its clear that unlike most scaling champs, he can build safer and do as much (and possibly more) for his team. Utilizing increasing health AND damage.","replies":[{"poster":"kyuzo on league","date":"2017-08-07T05:53:06.572+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"THAT SOOO BROKEN WTF....HE DOES 2k true dmg late....on R","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mokuto Bunshi","date":"2017-08-07T05:46:49.945+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oookay.
