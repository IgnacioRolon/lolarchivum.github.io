EVEN if you have more money than can be exhausted in a lifetime. You should feel INSULTED that someone would ask you to pay for an achievement of YOURS, any of them.\r\n\r\nI know you can read because you read this, even if this is read TO YOU, you get the idea. Imagine, for a moment, someone saying you have to pay to tell other people about your achievement of literacy or you have to act like it doesn't exist compared to people who gave in and payed... \r\nDoesn't sound right does it?\r\n\r\nI know its on PBE,\r\nI know were pushovers,\r\n but this IDEA should've never been conceived yet alone ever be executed.\r\n\r\nRiot wont read this and pay it nearly as much attention as people in their offices, but you will, boycott, ignore, type, yell, what ever. \r\nDon't let this stand.","replies":[]}
