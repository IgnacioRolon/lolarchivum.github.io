Why does it teeter so much? \nI remember the assassin meta but since the philosophy of riot games for assassins is as seen with the Rengar rework: \n&#039;If it can one shot you before you get to play the game(countermeasure/reaction) its not letting you have fun&#039;\nThat was broken up faster than either the tank or adc metas ever has been.\n\nI am NOT the best player, but I have always seen bot lane, top lane (tanks specifically) and either jungle or mid assassins as a game of rock paper scissors The best counter for an assassin is an Tank (Rock),\nThe best counter for a Tank is an adc (Paper) and, The best counter for an adc is an assassin (scissors). But a META is like what that rock grOWS TO THE SIZE OF AN ASTEROID AND ALL PAPER JUST BURNS OFF.  \n\n{{summoner:32}}  &lt;--- meteor covered in paper, result --&gt; {{item:3902}} \n\n\n \n{{item:3802}}                                                    &lt;---- Or an adc Meta is like when that sheet of paper over there.\n\nIs actually compressed (*insert metal stronger than titanium*) and can cut a PLANET in HALF. {{item:3634}} \n\n\n\nWhy is it this way? I know the devs aren&#039;t TRYING to make it this way... but why does it teeter back and forth?\n\nP.S.\nTo keep with the analogies Ill add the assassin one...\nhttps://cdn.drawception.com/images/panels/2017/5-22/dGg4YS6BBD-10.png\n(Didn't find any scissors ones!)","replies":[{"poster":"Mokuto Bunshi","date":"2017-12-07T02:00:56.581+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't really mean DOES it have to be this way so much as what things cause this?","replies":[]}]}
