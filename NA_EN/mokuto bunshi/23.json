Ice born? Killed. Ascended? Corrupted. The sisters Targonias and others? \nThwarted. But a little girl with an exo-suit ans some grit is the worlds resident expert on the creature the EXISTENCE that is the void (we don&#039;t know\nhow much knowledge she has about the PLACE [the one that eventually overtook ascended])... The disparity between her and say... vel&#039;koz? Makes you wonder how a human encased in a lesser void creature can fight THAT. The thing that took thousands of years and many deaths of OP beings to SLOW DOWN... the collector of the watchers... on summoners rift...\n\nShe is WAAAAAAAAAY underplayed as far as lore goes. Thats it, its the only explanation I got.\nThe power she wields is plasma, much like vel'koz, the guy made by watchers that can MELT TRUE ICE.\n\nThe more I think about it the bigger the disparity in lore between the champions that I haven&#039;t thought about becomes...\nThe human vs the super humans and monsters. I have to give the designers credit they do a good job and work HARD to make those differences come though\nin game play. Like aatrox being so OP that he does as much AOE damage with his Q alone as some single target fighter abiltities... but over an AREA.\nOr that fact that he has the ability to not die.\n\nBut there is only so far they can take this with the lore showing gaps this bigs, and the older the champion the more you feel it.\nWho would win in a fight? Draven Khazix? Well that makes snese lore and game wsie, khazix... he wins....\n\nBut now, who wins, Ornn or draven?... You mean to tell me a noxius hero armed with axes, can defeat Ornn.. the guy who made it\npossible to SEAL MANY watchers forever? (if someone had of lsitened to him that is...).\n\nThis is getting crazy. Im not complaining, I knida like the amazing balance the devs pull off.\nBut they certainly have their work cut out for them!","replies":[{"poster":"GreenLore","date":"2018-08-21T01:15:11.721+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think you are actually misunderstanding something here:\nKai'sa was never inside the void,she was in a cave with lots of void creatures.\n\nAnd there seems to be a huge difference in terms of strenght among the void creatures,just compare malzahars voidlings with vel'koz,so we can't really measure Kai'sas strenght based on other void creatures.","replies":[{"poster":"Jeddy017","date":"2018-08-21T01:43:05.222+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"I imagine this misunderstanding is going to plague Kai'sa for a long time.","replies":[{"poster":"Mokuto Bunshi","date":"2018-08-21T20:41:38.234+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Definitely.

If not for that, I too would have assume she has been to the actual Void itself. \nI just checked her bio & it's not really clear that she hasn't been to the Void. It's understandable that most people would assume she has, especially when her title is \"Daughter of the Void\".\n\nThis is just one of those things that should have been made clear when Kai'sa was released, both in lore & in game. It makes Kai'sa seem stronger than she actually is & make the Void not seem threatening as it shoud be. It also added to the fire of \"why Kai'sa looked like a normal girl with no significant void corruption?\"","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Meep Man","date":"2018-08-21T01:18:09.398+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kai'sa never has fought the most monstrous of the Void creatures. Has she fought some formidable ones? Yeah, probably. However, has she been in the Void and fought beings like Vel'Koz, Cho'Gath, or even Kha'Zix? No. Probably not. She at best has fought some pretty complex and large Voidling-like creatures and Rek'sai's brood.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Naalith","date":"2018-08-21T06:42:09.339+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not sure I can tell what the point of this post is other than you don't like Kai'sa, but I will say I'm glad the lore has insanely powerful beings. Having characters all have similar levels of power in the lore is both boring and limits storytelling. Normal humans can have good stories but there can also be the big bad of the gods battling in the background. I'm liking the direction they're going.\n\nAs for Kai'sa, ehh. She wasn't in the real Void but I will concede that 1) that's a fact not many people know and 2) she does seem to be less interesting than someone who combined with a sentient void carapace would be. Basically every other bit of lore they've released in new canon has been great though so I can't complain about one out of place character.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Iceborn","date":"2018-08-20T22:52:25.084+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Where did you gather that Velkoz can melt true Ice? \nAnd yes even lore needs a balance lol","replies":[{"poster":"Tahminatrix ","date":"2018-08-20T23:09:42.997+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"There is no counter stat to true damage so im sure any champion that has true damage can melt true ice.\n\n\n{{item:3031}} {{item:3046}} is enough to eventually wear it down, don't even need 100% crit, LOL.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mokuto Bunshi","date":"2018-08-20T22:56:11.421+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"WHoops I meant the watchers.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mokuto Bunshi","date":"2018-08-20T22:57:34.720+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Fixed, but yeah, the lack of balance is real XD","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"RyzeTheSmurfMage","date":"2018-08-21T07:15:31.107+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They are gonna nerf {{champion:13}} even in-lore if that happens.

When u have a world as mysterious as The Void, claim even glimpses of it drives people insane, and that it's horrifying, but then have a child not just survive, but thrive with NO detriment to her humanity, sanity and/or morality... it really downplays the severity of the Void, especially considering how little we knew about it at the time.   It's understandable to have the champ still be a paragon of thriving, but give some aspect of PTSD/mental difference that suggests Kai'sa is still fighting the goodfight, that it's a hardy battle, that she is a conqueror of the Void, but is still affected by it.  I get that they wanted to show a champ who is unaffected by the void...but I think it could've been implemented a bit better, or done abit later so u could build upon the nature of the Void.   A child simply doesn't stay years in a foreign, dangerous environment without coming out with a different outlook than the rest of their peers.  Even if they're able to empathize with them, there's some form of disconnect. Making her be older before she fell into the cracks may resolve that issue.  I haven't really paid much attention to Kai'sa recently so these are the fumes of a past debate I had as i've largely let it rest and accepted Kai'sa as a champ with high mental fortitude.   My theory is Kai'sa was dropped into an extremely peaceful area of the Void (relatively speaking).\n  \n\n\nIn terms of your later comment regarding \"who wins\" I think you are stretching a bit in comparing things.  (tho i guess some of my beliefs is cuz i don't think Kai'sa was dropped in a particularly dangerous area of the Void... as she really just fought fodder, and we KNOW that the Void has intelligent, sentient organisms.) Gameplay situations exist almost entirely independent of lore factualities, something that has been repeatedly stated.  The champions are just simulacrums of what the idea of the actual characters/entities are/were.  They aren't the actual champs, and have in fact been scaled down/buffed up to keep all at a similar level of power.   Sorta like a museum has interactive displays and models. \n\n\nThe Lore team's \"balance\" team consists of the writers who consolidate eachother with new information or make sure of certain things.   The Universe is still in beta, so subject to some alterations and changes, but what we need is a compilation of every relevant riot response to Lore.  and more AMA's... prbly a discord/podcast dedicated to lore alone, which is directly backed/supported by Riot clientele.","replies":[]}]}
