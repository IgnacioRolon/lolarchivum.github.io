Summoners rift is my issue. I have memorized every crack, every detail, every hook and every bend of that map. There are 3 bushes top, 2 bushes bot, 2 bushes mid, 2 Tri-bushes 6 river bushes, 6 buff bushes two per red one per blue, 8 lane bushes (that are also Tri-shaped),  2 bushes by the wolf camps, and 6 bushes by the inner blast plants (3 each), 19 top side and 18 bot side for a total of 37. I know that FROM MEMORY. I cannot name another game where I know the map better than my own living room. I find myself going to Aram and treeline not because I LIKE playing all mid or 3v3 but because I wanna see something different then I noticed something, I MEMORIZED THEM TOO LONG AGO! If you thinking about dominion and other maps, yet memorized them too. AND SO HAVE YOU!\n\nHere&#039;s an exercise that I did and you will be surprised how well you do. Take a piece of paper and a pen draw a rough square with rounded top-left/bottom-right edges and fill it in with the summoners rift... Before you get the paper. You already know you can do it don&#039;t you?\n\nThese maps layouts are very old. Older than MOST games still getting a player base.\n\nNow at this point you wondering... is what most writers would assume. I have no idea what you are wondering, but I am wondering this: what new mechanics, comps, play styles FUN could we have with a new modern map? There may be new things to discover on summoners rift, but its not like I wanna run OUT! I don&#039;t wanna find everything and be like, there, I am sure there&#039;s nothing left to find; but that&#039;s just how I feel, I&#039;ve run out.\n\nI am bored, I am bored of these maps, we need a change. _**I**_ Need a change...\nNew maps maybe?\n\nWhat about you? Don't you think we need new maps?","replies":[]}
