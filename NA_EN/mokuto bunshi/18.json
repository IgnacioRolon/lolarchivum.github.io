(At lvl 18 mind you) You are supposed to get a 40% slow... okay. That&#039;s 345 MS (with no boots) times 0.6 (the other 0.4 is gone because slow). and it SHOULD move at 207 MS. But instead the actual number when you click on him goes down only to 214 then goes back up again right after. You wait 4 second (max lvl cooldown) and it still gives you only 214...\r\n\r\nMaybe during the frame that his MS is 207 it isn&#039;t a frame where it refreshes the MS value display? Either way its bugging (pun unintended) me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nP.S. If this is related to our death recap being bugged please fix that too! (You guys are already fixing OUT of game UI....)\r\n\r\nPeace out!.... ᵃⁿᵈ ʷʰᶦˡᵉ ʷᵉʳᵉ ᵇᵉᶦⁿᵍ ʷᶦˢʰᶠᵘˡ, ᶠᶦˣ ᵐᵒʳᵈᵉᵏᵃᶦˢᵉʳ","replies":[]}
