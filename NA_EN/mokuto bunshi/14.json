Fair enough.\r\n\r\nfrom riot support: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ#h1q2\r\n&quot;No, your account will not be banned. However, it is possible to be punished for leaving just 1-2 games. Players who leave games will be placed in a low priority queue and will be required to play 5 matchmade games without leaving before exiting low priority queue.&quot;\r\n\r\nCan the timer for the que be updated come the new season?\r\n\r\n\r\nI could do like I normally do and make a well thought out argument but while writing this I am running for this ban so I hope this is enough to get consideration from the devs.\r\n\r\n]\\&#039;[","replies":[]}
