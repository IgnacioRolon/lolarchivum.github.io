Once he started rolling the enemy team never stood a chance.  \n\nIn the TSM Legends reality show TSM was joking that Faker is a Demon God from Hell.  But I think Bjergsen is hitting some kind of technical plateau right now and also is becoming a Demon God from Hell.\n\nI can't wait to see TSM at World's this year.  I want to see whether they can win against Korean and Chinese teams.  I know they will destroy the European teams.\n\nBjergsen right now is operating on a level that is above all other players in the LCS.  His accuracy in team fights with skill shots and timing when to go in is uncanny.  \n\nI suspect that Ahri will be a must ban against Bjergsen in the rest of the 2015 LCS season.","replies":[{"poster":"ZeroAnarchy","date":"2015-02-22T15:18:00.859+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly I don't think any NA team will do well at worlds, the competition is quite low.

IF you actually watch their matches:  The Chinese are not as nearly as good as they may appear.  Are they aggressive?  Yes.  Can they execute high skilled combo's attacks reliably?  Generally not.  Also they don't have much in the way of teamfights (overlapping combat) either... mostly a combination of solo plays that == a team fight.","replies":[{"poster":"ZeroAnarchy","date":"2015-02-24T21:14:52.704+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If Chinese teams are no threat, then why are they always placing higher than any NA/EU teams in pretty much any tournamanet they're in?

TSM and C9 got defeated by the 2 Samsung teams before any matchup could be had.\n\nA good example of this is Group B with TSM... that division had 2 Asian teams including former world champions TPA... yet TSM was able to take second place with 4/2 WL.  That matchup by TSM included 2/0 vs TPA and 1/1 vs SHRK.\n\nTherefore TSM *did* prove they can beat Chinese teams *in worlds*.","replies":[{"poster":"Vixanys","date":"2015-02-25T20:01:14.660+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So, when you say western teams are not threatened by Chinese teams you are narrowing it down to NA vs CN.

Alas the fact cannot be denied that TSM/C9 still in WOrlds 2014, made it to the knockout rounds, and were only knocked out by *Korean* teams.\n\nBTW All-Starts is irrelevant... not unlike the All STar games in other leagues; teams are not under pressure to win like they are in LCS World Championship.  If they win its good for them but they are not under the same and relevant pressure.  2013 Season in 2015 is completely irrelevant at this point as too many changes to game/meta have been made.\n\nThe only \"fanboyism\" here is your persistence that somehow Asia is undefeatable when clearly they are not alas...\n\n\nIndeed it is so...","replies":[{"poster":"Vixanys","date":"2015-02-26T15:50:04.910+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"All-Stars while irrelevant to any specific team standings still pits the \"BEST\" (always seems like a popularity contest) a region has to offer against other regions. You cannot say that NA losing to EU or CN or KR in this format completely voids any evidence in this debate. All teams, have the same advantages and disadvantages.\n\nThe only recent performance we can take from NA/EU vs Eastern Teams is 2014 Worlds.\nEach Chinese team that faced against NA teams (Group Stage) while performing marginally better than the previous year, was still rather lackluster. Best of Ones really do not show us much of what can be done. And NA teams TSM/C9 did amazing 3:1 is the best any NA team has done against Koreans previously.\n\nThere is no fanboyism from any comment I have included, as I repeatedly reiterate, I hope that NA/EU can do better this year and they are getting better though I still do not believe they will fare very well internationally (We may see differently come IEM Katowice).\n\nThe fanboy ranting you have displayed for TSM multiple times on this thread contradicts most of what you have to say, but I will leave that off since it is irrelevant.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ZeroAnarchy","date":"2015-02-25T00:01:48.713+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"SHR was not a number 1 seed from China and not to mention they were one dimensional and did you not see the game before that where they got completely smashed?

Best way to study this is to compare champion vs champion use.\n\nA few examples:\n\nNA TSM's Wildturtle's {{champion:222}} play is far better then the Asians in general.   Being able to reliably make use of the ultimate seperates the \"noobs\" from the \"heroes\".\n\n{{champion:429}} use... almost completely invented in NA.. is again far better in NA then Asia.\n\n\nAlas don't be fooled by the Asians... objects in the mirror are closer then they appear....","replies":[{"poster":"Vixanys","date":"2015-02-24T20:34:05.920+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You fail to see that NA/EU are limiting themselves in actual Worlds Experience. Korea does a Best of 3. China plays 2 game matches. All of this results in MORE COMPETITIVE PLAYTIME. These two competitive styles offer DOUBLE or sometimes TRIPLE the games. Also, since they are back to back, they offer adaption to play-styles. Korean goes further to have multiple playoffs through their season. \n\n1 Game Matches (played in EU/NA) lack this adaption and overall prevent NA/EU teams from growing from BEST of 3 and BEST of 5 matches that WORLDS is all about. (Group Stages are the only thing LCS format help in. After that then nothing. You cannot scrim for this, you can practice this very well.) \n\nAnother thing, use of individual champions aside (as this is a team game) and some regional metas favor some champions over others. The chinese and korean meta play is ridiculously better than EU/NA. You have EDG that can play Reactive Team Comps or Proactive Team Comps extremely well. GE Tigers are the same. While in the West, you have SK which can play a pretty good Proactive (engage comp) but flounder Reactive (poke, split push, late game comps) same could be said for TSM. Out of all of the Western teams CLG is the only one that has some semblance of diversity in their comps but they do not play each of these styles with the same proficiency as CN/KR.\n\nI hope for the best for NA/EU teams in Worlds, but the fact of the matter is they are only slowly catching up with those asians (as you put it).","replies":[{"poster":"TheGrandAlliance","date":"2015-02-24T20:41:50.335+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The comparisions are apples and oranges.
