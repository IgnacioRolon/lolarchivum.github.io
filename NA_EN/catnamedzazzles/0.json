Any ideas why?","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So it has been six days now since my connection problems happened. Each time i log in i get \"Did not recieve a response from the the server; retrying(#)\". I have sent Riot 2 emails about this and niether one answered my question of what is wrong here. Masima even posted a connection thread yesterday, February 2nd that explained my problem. But when he posted that it was fixed my server connection was not fixed. I live on the east coast of the US if that means anything(Riot's west coast over east coast preference) If i could have some help that would be great and thanks to any future comments that could help me.","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2014-02-04T02:17:29.165+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello Ima Sour Lemon!\n\nI appreciate you coming to the Help and Support Community regarding this issue!
