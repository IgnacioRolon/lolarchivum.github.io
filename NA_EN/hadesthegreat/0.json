Do they read both sides?","subforum":"Player Behavior","up_votes":2,"down_votes":7,"body":"So i was chat restricted for 10 games after a duo flamed me for literally 30 min&#039;s in game. ( i don&#039;t mute because i feel that it hinders communication and can cause for games to be lost more then won. I don&#039;t tilt easy) So after the game, in the lobby, they continued to flame me, and i defend myself(i did curse a little to much ill admit) They were flaming me because i lost top lane, after the duo(mid and jg) fed double buffs to my top lane when i was at base(i backed low, didn&#039;t die) and then i just couldn&#039;t fight him top anymore(the match was gp vs darius) So anyways, the two flame me all game, calling me trash, ect ect, and saying a ton of negative stuff to even the other team mates. The enemy team even agreed with me. Anyways long story short, after that game i log off, next time i log on im chat restricted. And the examples  they send me were of that match, how is it fair that we get flamed all game, and then we defend our self. we get punished, do the people who review reports even read both sides of things? Or is this a case of a faulty system that is easily abused?","replies":[{"poster":"IronwallJackson","date":"2016-06-24T18:18:28.205+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot's policy is that your actions are your responsibility.

You responded in kind, rather than taking the high road and not stooping to their level.\n\nEvery player is judged according to their own behavior, regardless of the behavior of others. If they were flaming you for 30 minutes, they'll be judged for that. If you flamed them back for 5 minutes, you'll be judged for that.

A premade's reports against a single individual is treated as a singular report so that premades can't automatically have more weight against other players for fraudulent reasons.\n\nAs for the chat logs here's a rundown of how things work:\n1. A report is filed against a player.\n2. The automated system screens the chat logs of the player, flagging any inappropriate language used by that player.\n3. The automated system then logs this report and the findings. If there have been enough previous reports with flagged inappropriate language, it takes action.\n4. A player receives punishment if the automated system has enough reported incidents in which it collected punishable behavior (be it language, AFK, etc).\n\nThis systems is actually pretty great. It punishes all players who are reported for their inappropriate language. If you are crass enough to \"defend yourself\" using inappropriate language, you probably deserve the punishment, especially if the system already had enough reported incidents to punish you.","replies":[{"poster":"VG Clerian","date":"2016-06-24T18:58:21.849+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Oleandervine,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=0acTgeEi,comment-id=00060000,timestamp=2016-06-24T18:56:16.509+0000)\n>\n> This is incorrect.

It has a very low error rate. The issues with the system are more related to not catching everyone who needs to be punished, but people reviewing cases doesn't improve that anyway.\n\nAnyone can submit a support ticket to get their punishments reviewed by a real person.

It would take a dedicated team of, oh, maybe thousands of moderators per language group to filter through all of the reports and use judgement calls. That's millions of dollars spent on just moderating behavior, which is an area that can very easily be left to automation so the money can be funneled into teams that can actually make the game better. It's unrealistic to expect a multinational company to waste that much money on something like this. \nFurthermore, this system is *working as intended.* Riot has issued that they have a zero tolerance policy for inappropriate language, regardless of the reason it was used. That means if someone calls you a \"f##king retard\" in chat and you \"defend yourself\" by calling them a \"f##king asshat,\" you're just as guilty of using inappropriate language as they are. There is no gray area in this. If you kill a man because he murdered your wife, you're still guilty of murder, just like that man. The objective here is to be the better person and not retort with the same toxic language.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Xidphel","date":"2016-06-24T18:18:06.530+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Defending myself\"\nAgainst what?","replies":[]},{"poster":"LostFr0st","date":"2016-06-24T18:18:03.914+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They read both sides.
