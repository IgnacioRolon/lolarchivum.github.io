Considering they have to split their gold into both MR and Armor, as well as HP, they tend to fall off every time they buy an item that grants a resist that doesn't apply to the opposite damage type enemy carry. Meanwhile the damage dealers have a very simple build path; More Damage. It's really simple for them, regardless of if they are AP or AD, and they scale at a steady rate regardless of comps.\r\n\r\nBasically, the item is intended to assist a tank late game, when they have stacked one mitigation type, and then they find themselves -needing- a little bit of the other resist as well. The item is cost inefficient early on, as the unique passive will do close to nothing, however when a tank has +250 armor from items, they can get +37.5 MR from the passive  (+the flat value) to help against those Corki rockets and Support Morg damage, they can get it cost effectively while still being able to gain even more armor / HP for that Riven Top, Lee jungle, and Zed mid, etc etc. The goal of the item is to only be efficient very late game, and to allow an Armor stacked, or MR stacked tank to cover the other neglected stat, and as such, scale appropriately into late game.\r\n\r\nThoughts?\r\n\r\nRemember, the stats suggested are just an example so you can understand the purpose of the item, the important thing is the item concept.","replies":[{"poster":"Wheatloaf","date":"2014-12-26T14:38:07.465+0000","up_votes":30,"down_votes":0,"body":"My only major qualm with this is... how would it interact with Garen?

Which is definitely false as well. 35% pen isn't enough to straight break a tank. The tank will still be able to function as a tank but with less potency towards attacks from welders of the item which would amount to the biggest damage dealers on the other team meaning that their adc/mage is focusing their dps on your team's tank instead of the rest of your team. And while sure they can still kill the tank 35% faster that's still more than enough time for your team to make use of.\n\nSo thanks for the downs and all but no, last whisper is not op and yes, a 20% or higher increase to resistance stats from an item with decent resistance stats of its own is broken.","replies":[{"poster":"Delioth","date":"2015-01-01T19:02:02.765+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly, the problem has never been 'tank itemization' on its own or 'damage itemization' on its own, it's the interaction between the two. As I've heard, S2 had problems with tank itemization being too strong, while now we're in the reverse of that- damage is everywhere and gives increasing returns on investment via the crit/attack speed/AD/ArPen compounding to increase damages further and further. On the flip side, Tank items give diminishing returns- the first 100 armor you get decreases damage to 50%. However, to halve the damage once more to 25% takes twice that amount- and Last Whisper will cut that to 33% damage. I.E. (Assuming both have 1-2 items) an adc can double their average dps by buying a Phantom Dancer. However, for a tank to double their durability (just vs. ad, no AP included, and with an armor item to bring 100 armor total) would have to buy a thornmail and a frozen heart- and if the ADC buys a LW, one of those items is ***completely negated.***\n\n**tl;dr**- the reason tanks and dps aren't balanced is because damage dealers get compounding returns while tanks get diminishing returns.\n\nNOTE: the heavily diminishing returns of defense is actually what promotes the bruisers- double-dipping is more efficient than getting more tankiness- the only way to counter this is to make tank items synergize with each other to make them more efficient to go full tank.\n\nOn another note, I know that offense needs to be > defense, but it should be at least a bit more even than it is now.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
