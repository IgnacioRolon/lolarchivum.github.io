Is this different in the VU? Like does it look more protected when compared to an open nexus? Or do you feel that health above the base is enough. It'd be a nice future touch at the very least :)","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2014-06-20T20:40:55.328+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good suggestion, I'll bounce it on to the SR team in case it's not something they're already looking.","replies":[{"poster":"Fish is Bae","date":"2014-06-21T00:49:37.071+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It makes intuitive sense for there to be two inhibitor-related visuals above the nexus:\n\n* an aura/barrier covering the entire nexus to represent all inhibitors and nexus turrets up; ie, the nexus is not attackable \n\n* 3 subtle visual indicators above the nexus, geometrically positioned in sync with the lanes, to show which inhibitors are alive\n\nIf done artfully, this will make sieging more understandable to new players, it will look awesome, and it will improve readability.","replies":[{"poster":"CyrDaan","date":"2014-06-21T04:27:53.796+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really do suggest taking a look at [this post](http://community.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/summoners-rift/4c2oiwf1-give-the-inhibitors-a-meaning) as a viable option in accomplishing your second goal.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Blackquill","date":"2014-06-23T17:58:51.370+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I personally hope that Riot seriously considers to implement something like this.
