No dice. My guess is OP either experienced a one time bug, or OP recalled next to a destroyed turret with his cursor on a destroyed tower while his passive was ready which allowed him to make the turret on the fountain after recalling. The latter is highly unlikely, however, so I'm quite skeptical on whether or not it's the cause. I'll try to recreate it later.","replies":[{"poster":"Jegitzu","date":"2014-10-04T00:35:36.653+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, I do not have a screenshot. (I regret not taking one)  And yes, this might have been a one time bug. After recalling (I don't remember where, but I doubt recalling next to a destroyed turret) I noticed the marker floating above the fountain turret. I activated my passive on it and sure enough it created a Sun Disc overlapping the fountain turret. \n\nThe Sun Disc's health bar does drain but gets regenerated probably due to the fact that the fountain regenerates health. Because of that, the Disc is pretty much invincible all game, which means I couldn't use my passive for the rest of the game. I also remember seeing the blue dot that shows on a destroyed turret on the minimap while your passive is up, right on the fountain turret. \n\nMatch History page (If it helps any): http://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/1565238776/42281202?tab=builds&participant=3","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"pierreluc14","date":"2014-10-03T02:54:44.637+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:268}} \n\nAdd more information  for reproduction bugs please \n","replies":[]},{"poster":"MugenNightmare","date":"2014-10-03T02:37:53.405+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If I recall, the fountain obelisk is considered a \"Tower\" in the game files so this doesn't sound so far fetched","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kats Pajamas","date":"2014-10-03T00:36:41.172+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"only a pro could kill the fountain turret, to revive it in the first place","replies":[]}]}
