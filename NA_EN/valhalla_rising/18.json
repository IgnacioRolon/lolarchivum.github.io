What would you like to see?","replies":[{"poster":"DrathTurtle314","date":"2015-04-07T02:15:17.643+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wanna see machine gun lulu or lulu jungle. lulu is already a flex, why not play her in one of the two roles you don't normally see her in.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Digivolve","date":"2015-04-07T19:40:29.142+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"an anti mobility mage, that has a targeted slow that removes the ability to use dashes/blinks for 5 seconds.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tyren","date":"2015-04-07T19:37:53.465+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I want to see Mundo go where he pleases.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vixanys","date":"2015-04-06T16:47:37.334+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"J4 Support in LPL.
