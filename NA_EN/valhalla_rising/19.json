Well, AD has received quite huge power creep buff.\nIn old times you have 2 items with lots of AD. BT and IE, right?\nNow lets count them: Death's dance, BT, IE, Edge of Night, Maw (when activated), duskblade, Mercurial scimitar, Youmuus. And it's not like they give just AD. They give whole lots of other usefull stats. And if you lack crit/AS you get 3 better than decent picks that always work: PD, Statikk and Runaan\n\nIn other words, there was no powercreep in mage builds. But there sure is power creep in AD itemization. I do know I mentioned assassin tools, but Riot didn't care to make them non-abusable by ADCs.\n\n> Swain and Karthus had dumb and cheesy lv 1 CC.\n\nSo? A CC-ability on 12-15s CD.

And Swain couldn;t even get to the target in time.\n\n> Oh, they had a higher winrate than 50% when DFT was released, trust me, Riot just leaped at the chance to nerf that crap and then nerfed DFT too.\n\nYeap. Like everyone abusing TLD. Or other masteries I think. I don;t remember any ADC being nerfed cause they abused that lifesteal one. Only Yasuo got hit if I remember right.\n\nAnyways swain/karthus nerfing and DFT nerfing were 2 different times.

Like Amumu? Or Swain?\nAnyways it rather will fail. Lets just forget about passive and focus on AP and HP and gold cost.\n1. It gives too little HP, it's decent Ap will allow TankAkali / Katarina to still abuse it.\n2. Low cost (with TERRIBLE gold efficiency) means this is by no means endgame item. Thus it won't be worth a flying fart once game gets to final minutes. That amount of HP it gives is worth 1 crit from ADC.\n3. As mentioned before, terrible gold efficiency.

The thing is, the time period to catch them out or burst them down is quite high during the early game, so it's fair.\n> Well yeah.

All classes started to get balanced around ADC class.\n* For 3 years ADCs increased power to the point, where by their sheer number of yapping on forums/boards one class could be nerfed.\n* And so it happend. \"The yappening\" of angry ADC mob focused on mages. Items nerfed, mana potion removed, masteries for mages nerfed, mages nerfed.\n* Somewhere here we got [Tank update], where Riot took their time to clean some of old tank tools... Nerfing tanks in the priocess. It was caused of just starting [The yappening 0,5]. Riot prevented full power of yappening by nerfing tanks asap.\n* It somehow calmed a little after Riot implemented alot more tools for ADCs to cope with mages [ADC update]. \n* But ADCs didn't bother to buy those tools, so \"the yappening 2\" happend [Mage update]... Or to be more precise [Support update]\n* Once again mages nerfed, mage items nerfed or reworked to support, ADCs got new tools & supports\n* Again it calmed from ADCs side... Untill they decided \"assassins be too OP\"...\n* ...\"The yappening 3\". Major gutting on assassins in the [assassin update]... Along with new tools for ADCs to fight versus MAGES and Assassins...\n* Now we are here, in this moment. Riot is most likely tired and afraid of \"The yappening 4\" to take place, so they are nerfing mages anyways, just in case, so ADCs wouldn't open their air holes.\n* Now, in not too distant future we will receive [tank update 2].

On one hand, I'm personally not a fan of stat amplifiers, but on the other, I don't like how this takes more late-game power away from AP champions. A lot of buffs to AP and tanky items so far have been cost reductions, too, whereas AD items, especially marksman items, retain consistently higher costs, and usually more raw power as well. This is frustrating, because this means non-marksmen tend to cap out quicker and feel like they can't enhance their power any further, whereas marksmen get late-game dominance handed to them by raw statistical superiority. Super-early itemization is also a lot easier for AD champions than it is for AP or tanky champions, since Long Swords cost significantly less than Amp Tomes and Ruby Crystals, so it just feels like there's altogether a major skew in itemization and power progression overall, one that need not exist.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Meep Man","date":"2016-11-28T14:00:24.369+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"https://i.makeagif.com/media/10-01-2015/fj9U56.gif\n\n**\"WHO NEEDS LIMITS WHEN YOU HAVE INFINITE POWEEEEEER!\"**","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mishli","date":"2016-11-28T13:04:22.043+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"they also just buffed (imo) abyssal scepter and removed the aura from locket, that's a 20-30% boost in raw damages. \n\nPersonally with protobelt and glp...
