Lux can throw out her entire combo every 30ish seconds (including ultimate) instantly one-shotting nearly anyone. Morgana can chain CC someone for days between her QRQ combo with max CDR. The list goes on - discussing a champion's kit based on them having a combination of 3+ items worth of CDR isn't really a conversation worth having.\n\nTake advantage of Fizz when he is weak - bully him out of lane pre-3 and chase after him hard if he uses his E to farm, its got a huge mana cost and cooldown early. Every champion in this game has weaknesses, you just have to exploit them properly. Picking Twisted Fate, Viktor or other immobile champions into an assassin that excels in mobility is going to hurt - its not about a broken kit but more about poor decision making on your part.","replies":[{"poster":"DarkSunSovereign","date":"2016-05-09T13:26:03.598+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Suuuure.
