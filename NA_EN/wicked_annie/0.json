That seems like too much to me, his W being the only ability I can complain about in itself. I can tolerate Lee, but I do think more tuning should be done to put him in an ideal position.\n\nFizz brings up a couple of design questions that I am genuinely hoping someone can answer. I can understand why a move like his Q would deal both magic and physical damage (even though it's still a bit fishy), but I see no particular reason to have it apply both on-hit effects and spell effects other than to have it combo with his W and make Lich Bane a must-buy. It's one of the abilities in the game where flashing before he hits you but after it starts guarantee's you'll take the damage, so this ability can seal someone's fate pretty easily. I've seen plenty of people complain about his lack of counterplay, but I think there are 2 possible changes they could make that seem somewhat fair from my perspective.\n\n1: Fizz's E allows him to do everything from towerdive to negate ultimates that are otherwise unable to be dodged and are balanced around that fact (ie Darius or Zed). Why not change it so that he's still untargetable mid jump, but no longer make him invincible? No longer can he RWQEE you while you're under tower and not get hit by the turret once. Already cast spells/fired turret shots will follow him the same way that a Sigil of Malice will do a 180 if the target goes behind the projectile, but champions with targetted abilities still won't be able to cast them while he's in the air.\n\n2: Fizz's Q applying all affects makes it so that he can get in and out of a situation (along with his E), his only moment of vulnerability through the maneuver being his small hitbox mid Q, before both parties go back to laning as normal. If Fizz's Q no longer applied on-hit effects, he'd have to land a basic attack before trying to leave the situation and get the full damage out. This opens up an extra half second of counterplay to his combo while keeping his damage the same, especially since abilities like his Q and E can put him in range of enemies for his basic attack easily.\n\nTLDR - I can tolerate Lee despite thinking he could be in a better position, but I have a few genuine concerns about Fizz's design and mechanics.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MrBuffington","date":"2014-12-28T00:43:22.951+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Don't care as much about Lee, Fizz on the other hand, I will ban until the end of the earth; it's the only viable counterplay lol (esp since Ryze got gutted).
