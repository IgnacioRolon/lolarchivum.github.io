It's been a very long time since I made this account (2009) So to be honest I don't remember what questions I chose or even the answers I used with them and I wouldn't want to lose my account because I don't know them. \n\nThere is only a small chance I would remember my answers if I knew the questions. Cause questions like (Whats your favorite color), the answer for that can change over time.\n\nSo in short, can I change my recovery questions?\n\nPS: I never got the king rammus skin, which if I remember correctly was for voting for some game of the year.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-24T04:10:29.581+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The account recovery questions aren't chosen by yourself but picked in a way so that only the original account creator could remember them.
