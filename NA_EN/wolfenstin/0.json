I had no plan to do so, but I was just angry and needed to rant. Didn&#039;t realize the message went out to my team, so it looked like I was basically saying in the first 5 minutes I wanted to AFK.\r\n\r\nI was insanely embarrassed, so I muted everyone and stayed quiet the rest of the game save for another, frustrated accidental &quot;Whelp&quot; that was again, meant to go to my friend, not the team chat.\r\n\r\nI proceeded to play like absolute ass, not intentionally, but I was so tilted that there was no recovering. Now I just feel guilty, disgusting, and so unbelievably angry with myself, I almost want to be banned.\r\n\r\nI know, it was stupid to type that, but I&#039;m afraid the auto system is going to pick me up as a feeder/troll since no doubt all my perfect, shining gold teammates who shouldn&#039;t have to put up with this reported me.\r\nAm I screwed? Might as well face the music now.","replies":[{"poster":"redniwediS","date":"2017-11-17T03:05:26.475+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You should be fine.  This isn't a habit of yours, and you didn't say anything particularly bad, so odds are you won't get any mark against your account.\n\nThat said if you suddenly start behaving like a piece of shit this game would likely be part of a number of games that lead to a punishment, but only if your team reported you and only if the automated system looks for AFK, which I actually doubt with how people tend to use it more when they have an AFK on their team, rather than when they are the afk.\n\nTo put it more simply you can relax now, you're fine.","replies":[{"poster":"Wolfenstin","date":"2017-11-17T03:09:13.930+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't plan on suddenly turning toxic, this was honestly the worst thing I've done in... well actually ever.

As long as you don't say anything very very bad that could be considered really offensive to people, you won't get banned off of 1 game. If all that happened was an accidental leak of a comment saying you are so angry/tilted you wanted to AFK but you still kept playing that game and didn't flame anyone, then your team would just think you were really tilted and annoyed this game and not think anything of it.\n\nThough if something like this does happen again for you, I'd just suggest to say sorry to your team and say you really didn't mean that you wanted to AFK. Despite popular belief, the average league player isn't always so toxic. In reality, assuming you aren't the toxic person then you will generally run into a lot more nicer people than toxic people....it's just the toxic players always leaves a much bigger impact on your opinion of that match.\n\nJust be careful next time and everything should be fine.","replies":[{"poster":"Wolfenstin","date":"2017-11-17T03:28:30.636+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, I didn't say anything else, just the 'whelp'.
