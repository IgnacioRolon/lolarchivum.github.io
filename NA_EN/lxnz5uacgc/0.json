I hope that you can lift the suspension as I am not using any scripts or anything that would give me an &quot;Unfair advantage&quot;. If however the mouse keybinding is a problem, I will remove it if given the chance, thank you for reading my side, I love league of legends and I hope to continue to play.&quot;\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd then I got this reply, not lifting my permanent ban, but telling me that Im still doing something wrong even though I have NEVER used any hacks or scripts on league\r\n\r\n\r\n&quot;Hello UR,\r\n\r\nYour account has been permanently suspended following the use of scripts, hacks, exploits or unauthorized third-party programs in League of Legends.
