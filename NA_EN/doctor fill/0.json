The reason for this is that I play with a razer orbweaver and i use the little analog stick on it to move my screen. This is just what i have gotten used to over the years. I've had issues in a team fight where i'm moving the mouse fast but it throws my screen off and i have to re-orient my screen which can and has been devastating in a team fight. Again, i'm talking about unlocked screen and not answering it by playing only on locked screen.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-16T01:25:39.114+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly, I'm pretty sure locked or semi-locked is the only option for not moving the screen when the mouse hits the borders of the window. You could also hold space to keep the window centered all the time, but that would obviously get a little annoying for sure.","replies":[]}]}
