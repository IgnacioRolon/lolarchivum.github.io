Please keep in mind that it is not possible to be promoted from Silver 4, into Gold 1.  In most cases, players only promote into the next highest division when they are up for their promotion series.  It IS possible to be promoted to a max of 2 higher divisions (go from Silver 5 straight to Silver 3 for example), but this is only in rare circumstances where your hidden rating does not correspond to the division you are currently in.  \n\nI hope that this alleviates some confusion!","replies":[{"poster":"ploki122","date":"2014-01-10T02:52:57.129+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To complement this, or rather put more clearly, all tiers are divided into 5 divisions. 5 is the lowest and 1 is the highest, so it's more like ranks (aka you're in the 5th tier of goldies) than grades (aka you went from AA to AAA).","replies":[]}]}]}
