I can still click things but the display is frozen. I discovered a temporary fix. When I click play, the process \"LeagueClientUxRender\" takes up a large portion of CPU. When I end the process the client will refresh and things will work as normal. What is causing this? I am on Windows 7. I have tried the full repair on the log-in screen and I have tried redownloading league as well.\r\n\r\nP.S.
