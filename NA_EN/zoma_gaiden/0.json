Accounts created after those items are given away, don't receive those gifts. Sometimes in the past when something like Snowdown event were live, Riot would add in little contests, like get hit or hit others with so many snowballs and get a free icon. We have the rotating game mode now though.\n\nI haven't read anything lately about any new promotions. Any past promotions you have missed are unfortunately gone. Hextech is the only thing I can think of off the top of my head.","replies":[]},{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-06-21T00:59:27.098+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not entirely sure I know what you mean.
