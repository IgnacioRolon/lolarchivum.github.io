When these 2 premades start flaming me since the start of the game. They calling me stupid for playing adc with cull, calling me retard and other things because I was missing my skillshots or choosing to recall instead of farming. I asked the enemy team to report them and they kept going so I started to afk farm because they were too toxic. And at the end of the game they told me I will get banned. I&#039;ve been banned before and now I got perma banned for this ? I didn&#039;t call them retards or anything close to that because I decided to stop flaming.. How is this fair ?

The people at the movie theater will break it up. Riot doesn't do this because honestly it would be too hard. \n\n2.) Ok, so you expect players not to react to toxicity right? And that most players aren't toxic? Well he's the flaw. If there is a toxic person in every game (always seems to be for me there is at least one toxic person per the 2 teams) that's about 10% of the community. Now, lets calculate. 67,000,000 players and about 10% are toxic.... 6,700,000 toxic players in the game. That's almost 7 million! THAT'S A LOT. AND THAT'S PER MONTH, JUST ON THE NA SERVER. That's a lot. Now I get not all players are toxic, but you have an almost 7 million player problem in the game.

All I've been saying is that responding to them with MORE toxicity isn't a good solution, and is one that Riot has stated they'll punish BOTH participants for.\n\nAnd yeah, the number is high.

It's 1/100 with the statistics I provided. (10% x 10% = 1%). If one in 100 games have two toxic members who will flame eachother, what's the chance you'll get caught in the middle of it and  have to face an emotional punishment for at least 20 minutes. Most people will break when getting flamed by two or more people, good for you that you can use the mute button. Good for you that you don't care what others think but most people can't deal with it. At least with the personal stuff, most players can deal with being called bad at a game but when you start getting personal it usually hurts enough to provoke. I'm not saying this is the case with this person, not even trying to argue that. But acknowledge it does happen and people are being punished for human reaction.","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2017-04-17T19:11:14.517+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Pouting,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=VyddWbEB,comment-id=00090001000100010000000000000000,timestamp=2017-04-17T18:37:17.494+0000)> Do you know the chance of two toxic players meeting in a game?

[10% x 10% = 1%].\n\nWell, the statistic Riot has given us is 5% of players being punished, but let's assume your statistics are correct for the sake of an argument.\n\n>If one in 100 games have two toxic members who will flame eachother, what&#x27;s the chance you&#x27;ll get caught in the middle of it and  have to face an emotional punishment for at least 20 minutes. \n\nHere's the problem though. Let's assume that you're someone who responds to a toxic environment with added toxicity. Then let's compare that to a non-toxic player caught in the middle.\n\nThe non-toxic player encounters a game with two toxic players arguing 1% of the time, by your statistics. If they don't engage or respond in a toxic manner, this means 1% of their games will have two toxic players arguing.\n\nThe toxic player responds to toxicity WITH toxicity. 10% of players are toxic, and, when he encounters one, he reacts in a similar fashion. That player will thus behave toxically  10% of the time -- each time he encounters another toxic player. He's part of the problem, as he turns 10% of his games into what SHOULD be 1% of his games.\n\n>Most people will break when getting flamed by two or more people\n\nSource? This seems contrary to my many-year *League* experience, but anecdotal evidence on both our sides isn't helpful. If Riot is correct and 5% of players are punished for toxicity, that seems to go against the \"most people will break\" statement.\n\nEither way, there is hitting a point where you snap, and RELIABLY hitting a point where you snap, or snapping in such a way that you insult, belittle, or flame your fellow players.
