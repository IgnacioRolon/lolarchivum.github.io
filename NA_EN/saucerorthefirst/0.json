One of the things that I bought was the Full Metal Jayce skin that is on sale for 50% off and it costs 675 RP. However, I was charged full price for the skin as if it weren't on sale. I was at 2320 RP and I am now at 970 RP. Please Help.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-11T16:40:03.060+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looking into your specific issue, it looks like Full Metal Jayce was purchased for 675 RP.  Keep in mind that a few minutes before you also obtained Ivern and Jayce for RP as well.  Also, sometimes your balance may appear out of sync but relogging should fix that up.  Hope that helps clear things up!","replies":[{"poster":"SaucerorTheFirst","date":"2016-10-11T17:12:19.682+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What had gotten me about this was after I bought Ivern the RP didnt show that it had gone down so I thought the FMJ skin was charged for full price. My bad! Sorry for wasting your time.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Oh Look Kaede","date":"2016-10-11T16:34:41.856+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm sorry to hear that!
