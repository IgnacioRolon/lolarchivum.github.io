I was supporting as Sona and our whole team is Vietnamese, but only one person spoke a tiny bit of English (mostly flame words). I went bot with varus, he turret dives and get stuck in minions and starts mass pinging assistance all over me even after I already healed him. He gets a death from minions/turret, the other team did not get credit, but of course &#039;report sona troll&#039;. And I said &#039;watch minions, i did everything I could to save you&#039;. Yet he does it AGAIN, and this time gives them a kill, and spams pings all over me, and then leaves lane to go mid. \n\nThen he dies 2 or 3 more times to mid, and what does mid say? &#039;report sona lost game&#039; and then all of them start speaking in Vietnamese clearly insulting me. Then top is AFK and I start pinging assistance to Top turret. Of course they have to chime in &#039;sona go top noob&#039; after bottom and mid is getting wrecked mostly because of Varus dying and AFK&#039;ing. Top now goes bot and dies 3 times. &#039;Sona fed bot gg&#039; while I only have 1 death. They continue to trash talk in Vietnamese for rest of the game clearly blaming me for their own feeding. This game was mindblowingly bad and trollish, I just had to share it. Sadly this wasn't the first time I had an all foreign team trolling me and trash talking while they are doing terribly.\n\nAlso, this isn't hateful toward Foreigners/Vietnamese, it's just more annoying when people are flaming you in another language especially when it continues all game cause they know you can't understand them, especially when they are the ones feeding.","replies":[{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-04-12T22:20:59.111+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"4 premades are the most awful thing to ever come to League.
