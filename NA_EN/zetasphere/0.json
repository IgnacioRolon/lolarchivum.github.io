Thanks to the cool Support bros, it's back in my hands. On the store page were a number of purchases made with RP from a PayPal account (not mine). I asked Support Bro and he said whatever purchases were made while my account was compromised were mine regardless. Now, I think that's kinda cool so I go check to see if the items in the purchase history are around and they kind of aren't.\r\n\r\nThis does not bother me one bit, actually. I didn't make the purchases so I lose nothing in the not having of them. My concern stems from what could potentially happen were I to refund one of these purchases for content I didn't pay for and are not unlocked on my account (despite showing up in the transaction history and having the big REFUND button beside them)?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-07T16:15:32.058+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm glad we were able to help you out with recovery!  I believe it could cause issues with your account, but it's best to ask your support bro specifically for more details specific to your account.  Hit them up directly in your ticket, and they should  be able to clarify!","replies":[{"poster":"Zetasphere","date":"2017-10-07T16:32:39.455+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks muchly, friendo.
