Are those that are banned simply that much more toxic than someone with an insanely large amount of chat restricted games? \r\nShouldn&#039;t any reformed player (riot probably has data that can show who has reformed vs. who hasn&#039;t. right?) be eligible for rewards? \r\n\r\nWhat do you guys think? Is my confusion over this justified? I just feel as if there is a weird inconsistency going on here that isn&#039;t being properly addressed.","replies":[]}
