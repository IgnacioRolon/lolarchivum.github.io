Most of the down votes are directed at threads about OP's punishment or critiquing riot's system and at comments questioning the system or critiquing riot. While most of the up votes are directed at comments telling OP they messed up.\r\n\r\nAs per the Universal Rules\r\n\r\n>Up votes and down votes are intrinsically tied to how threads and comments are perceived. It’s easy to simply down vote something you disagree with, and up vote things that support your views. We can do better. Consider up voting thoughtful discussions and comments, even if they disagree with your perception of things. The more valuable conversation we have on the boards and the more that conversation is recognized as a good contribution to the community, the better everyone’s board experience will be.\r\n\r\nIf you take a look, a lot of discussion threads are blasted with down votes, a lot of explanation request threads are blasted with down votes. The majority of threads on this board have a negative vote counter. I doubt that the majority of the threads there have no value in conversation, it seems that people are just voting purely based on agreement and disagreement rather then on the discussion and comments. it doesn't stop there. I've personally been mass down voted by a couple of users (and I'm sure some of the more controversial/critical users here have been to) on every comment I make regardless of content. For a board that's supposed to help with toxicity it certainly has a lot of toxic behavior ingrained in it. \r\n\r\nI don't know if users that abuse the up and down vote systems can be detected/moderated or have actions taken against them but this is an actual quality of life issue with this board that needs to be addressed.\r\n\r\nNote to mods: Not sure if this belongs here or in discuss the boards because this does pertain to player behavior and \"fostering a healthy community in which discussions can revolve around player behavior systems or in-game suspensions\" as per the description of the board. A bit meta but lemme know if it should be moved.","replies":[{"poster":"CharDeeMcDenniz","date":"2019-06-08T11:52:45.512+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Shadowbyte,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=MmF8lWbw,comment-id=,timestamp=2019-06-08T06:33:37.605+0000)\n> it seems that people are just voting purely based on agreement and disagreement \n\nnothing wrong with this at all\n\ninstead of delving into a full response to an obviously toxic OP, a downvote is a great way to disagree without muddying the waters with repeated and easily googled answers that the OP wont listen to anyway","replies":[{"poster":"GatekeeperTDS","date":"2019-06-08T12:17:45.819+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":4,"body":"Agreed.

This board is for explaining the system to people who have questions about it. It's bound to have similar questions being asked due to the nature of the system. Different people have different cases, if we were all like you and said \"anything similar to x y z shouldn't be posted\" then we'd have missed all the cases that was INDEED a system error and would have not have helped players understand their punishment.

That your explaination isn't how the system **IS**. You constantly keep pushing that everything you say is right when it simply isn't. You've been reprimanded before for aggravating behavior before and members of the community have expressed concern about their interactions with you multiple times. You would go as far to call someone a liar without reviewing evidence that clearly shows otherwise to push you opinion as \"truth\". You clearly don't care enough to help others and are just pushing your opinions as facts.
