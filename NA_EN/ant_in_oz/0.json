The stories for many champs need some love, and we want you guys to have a voice in helping us determine where we need to focus our attention.\n\nA couple caveats to set expectations:\n\n* This isn't a promise to drop everything and focus on fleshing out your favorite champ's background (at least not yet) straight away. Having said that, if there are some clear favorites among players around the world, then we’d like that to factor into our decision-making process.\n\n* Please don’t offer up specific story ideas – legally, we just can’t use them (the same reason I don’t read fan-fic – it’s a can of worms from a legal POV).\n\n* Also, I can't promise exactly when or how we’ll be able to deliver on this stuff. Despite the best intentions, we've burned ourselves before by making overzealous promises, so we’d rather not go down that route.\n\nLooking forward to hearing your thoughts!\n\nCheers!","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Sweet","date":"2015-02-05T03:00:02.980+0000","up_votes":82,"down_votes":7,"body":"Hey guys, just a tip here: upvote your favorites so Oz can spot them more easily!","replies":[{"poster":"Rune Ocarina","date":"2015-02-06T00:42:40.014+0000","up_votes":203,"down_votes":25,"body":"I can't be the only one who wants to hear and see more about {{champion:92}}  and {{champion:157}} !

Jayce's lore made Viktor seem far more 'cartoonishly evil' than his own lore even came close to hinting at him being.  Until that point he seemed obsessed with his ideas, but he meant no ill will towards humanity.  He was a brilliant scientist, but Stanwick's betrayal meant that he lost everything he had worked for.  He still wanted to make the world a better place, but now his goals had changed.  He came to the conclusion that the only way to improve the world was to improve humanity.  Machines are perfect.  They are not bound by human flaws and weaknesses, and if man could become like machines, then man too could be perfect.  There is no need to consider adapting through the Glorious Evolution a loss of one's humanity, it is simply wanting to become a better human.  \n\nWith Jayce's lore Viktor essentially became the very thing his own lore showed he hated:  Someone that steals others' ideas/projects for their own gain.  He stole the crystal, defeated Jayce's security, then went back to Zaun.  By the time Jayce came to retrieve the crystal, Viktor had already put it to use in his labs, but the fact that he and his acolytes were unable to even stop one man shows a weakness that was never implied in his original lore.  Before the removal of the Institute of War, it was Viktor's augmentations to his own form that impressed the Summoners enough to grant him access into the League of Legends.  They thought he was worthy of taking on monsters and other incredibly strong opponents, with only his own technology to aid him.  While it's true that Jayce was also injured when he fled Zaun after destroying the crystal, the fact that Viktor was defeated in his own labs made it seem like his character was fundamentally changed into something both mentally and physically weaker just to make Jayce seem like a 'good guy.'  \n\nViktor is such an interesting and complex character, but apart from the promos for the Battlecast skins (which I'm not sure is even canon) he's been ignored.  So much could be done, and I hope Riot hasn't forgotten about him and the original purpose of his Glorious Evolution.","replies":[{"poster":"Crett","date":"2015-02-05T10:42:57.768+0000","up_votes":86,"down_votes":2,"body":"I honestly think Jayce wrote his own lore.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"InvisaBishh","date":"2015-02-05T02:58:53.540+0000","up_votes":130,"down_votes":8,"body":"The champion I and a whole lot of others would love to know more about is {{champion:28}}. \n\nRight now we know that she is an expensive, deadly assassin, and that Jax recognizes her skills, but that's pretty much it.

How did he get his lightning power?Does he ever go back to Bandle City?Does he partake in the Blood Moon event?\n{{champion:89}} - Praise the Sun.Now,Leo is an extension of the whole Targon thing.What I want specifically is how she view the whole Diana situation.I figure she loves the sun,but I doubt she's willing to harm others who simply doesn't follow her belief.

Narrative says that it wants to avoid another \"Great Retcon\" disaster, and take care to retain the essence of Champions even when their backstories are being considerably altered; I think the community deserves to be asked about its impressions of what the essence of each Champion might be. If Riot's serious about promoting greater flow of ideas between Narrative and the community, let's start with the Champions and settings that are scheduled for major changes.\n\n---\n\nBut whoa, whoa. Hold on a second.\n\nIf this is meant to be Narrative finally coming around to engage with the community, you can't just toss this in without explanation:\n\n> Please don’t offer up specific story ideas – legally, we just can’t use them (the same reason I don’t read fan-fic – it’s a can of worms from a legal POV).\n\nWhat is a \"specific story idea\"? And why do you believe that it is legally impossible for them to be discussed?\n\nI don't think this should be just casually tossed out there. Taken at face value, it says: \"Whatever you do, community, don't give us ideas. We aren't legally allowed to look at the community's ideas.\" That is fundamentally incompatible with the Riot design model.\n\nSo is a \"specific story idea\"…a draft of a story? An outline for a specific piece of written work, e.g. \"Teemo infiltrates the Shadow Ninja Clan in Ionia\"? A thematic concept, e.g., \"I think Piltover should create a bullet train to Demacia\" or \"there should be a Noxian custom of giving kids their first axe for their sixteenth birthday\"?\n\nIf, as I suspect is the case, this is just \"don't give us drafts or a specific outline of a story\", then fine. If it's \"we can only tell you our ideas, we can't read your comments on our ideas or your own ideas\", then this whole enterprise is a farce.\n\nI've heard good things about Riot's legal team. I'd be disappointed if they had issued a company-wide directive to \"never look at community ideas\". That sounds like very poor \"tell your client not to do anything because there might be a risk if all the courts in the country went mad at the same time\" lawyering. I know IP law is broken, but I don't think it's that broken. Even if it is, perhaps I have a higher opinion of your legal team than you do, but surely they can put together a solution: a disclaimer, for instance, or more narrowly defined rules as to what's okay and what isn't. \n\nSo please, explain what you mean by \"specific story ideas\".","replies":[]},{"poster":"kuwatabi","date":"2015-02-13T20:06:28.840+0000","up_votes":34,"down_votes":1,"body":"To me it seems like most people want to hear more stories about the characters which already have a lot of lore, or which are already interesting (Leona - Diana, Riven - Yasuo, Freljord and Shurima), but I think Riot should try to make the other ones more interesting. But glad to see that slowly some structures get developed between league judgements, the journal of justice, the influence of summoners and so on.\nI think that most bigger nations are well defined (Demacia, Freljord, Shadow Isles, Shurima), but I think two of the bigger States - Noxus and Ionia - are missing lore.  Since I haven't read all of Noxus lore yet, I'll just comment about Ionia.\n\n_______________________________________________\nWe know that there are Elders in Ionia, which are the head of the state. Every 8 years, people can fight to be a part of the elders.  Each region of Ionia is represented by one elder. Currently we know three regions in Ionia, Galrin, Navori, and Shon-Xan. A part of Ionias story has to get rewritten because the rely so heavily on the league (joining the league for defense against Noxus, Noxus-Ionian Rematch, etc.) But there are still many things you can do with the Ionian Champs, and many relations which can be formed.\n\n\n_______________________________________________\n**Ionia**: How many elders and provinces exist in Ionia? Does each elder has a special task like **Irelia**  being captain of the guard? And how do you get to be an elder? It was told that you have to compete in special competitions every eight years, but that kinda seems odd, because **Karma**  and **Irelia** kinda are elders because of their outstanding performances in the fight against Noxus?\nDoes everbody in Ionia seek for enlightment prior than learning how to fight? Are they all pacifistic? If so, why are there so many different styles of fighting? \n( Irelia, Lee Sin, Udyr , Yi, Varus, Akali,  Kennen, Yasuo, ...)\n\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSo, {{champion:238}}  trains students in the former Kinkou Training Place. Is **Kennens , Akalis  and Shens**  only task to get it back? Besides... Watching Star Constellations or whatever they do? Do they have responsibilites towards Ionia, or are they independent and fight for balance in Valoran?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{{champion:134}} 's goal is to kill the Ionian Elders. Does she plan on doing that on her own or will she ally with Noxus? She's already allied with **Zed** , despite him already having reached his goal. Do they plan on bringing chaos to Ionia or do they want to rule it?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{{champion:16}}  is a being of the stars. But now she kinda isn't any more, but she doesn't care. Is her only task now to heal wounded people? Is she allied to Ionia or is this just her residence, where she shares her Enlightment in the Placidium?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n {{champion:11}} : What is Yi  up to? His storyline seems kinda finished. Does he just want to train students in the art of Wuju? Will he fight alongside **Irelia**  for Ionia? Even if he doesn't search for vengeance any more? Does he feel with **Varus**  who has a similiar story or does he judge him?\n\n\n**Now, to the more interesting characters of Ionia. They are kinda involved in the war of Valoran. Even though not everyone hast to be involved in political things, I think the other Ionian Champions just lack connections. \n**\n\n\n\n\n\n {{champion:39}} : What happened to **Irelia's** Brother? Is she grateful because **Soraka**  brought her back to life? Did her father really died of a strange, mysterious, neverseen illness? (sounds like an idea of old riot, new riot would take the chance and make it a political murder or something)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{{champion:64}}s (to be honest, really bad) story has to be rewritten. He got polically involved when starting a riot (ha!) against the Noxian Invasion. Is he still politcally involved? Will he fight despite the fact that the monks of Ionia are very peaceful (and therefore died in **Karma's** lore). Does he approve of Ionia fighting or will he remain passive?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{{champion:43}}  has a very underwhelming lore regarding the fact that she is the Duchess of Ionia, her title being \"the Enlightend one\" (seemingly the best thing you can be called in Ionia since everyone is searching for enlightment ), that she is the leader and figurhead  of the rebellion, that she can summon the symbol of Ionia (the twin dragons) and that she is also kind of the supreme elder. In her lore she kinda just protects a small village by killing one single person (her old lore was more impressive, how she stopped the noxian soldiers with the power of words and her charisma). Was she a regular young girl, with strong bindings towards the spirit world, before Noxus attacked? How did she get to be the Duchess of Ionia? By summoning the twin dragons? Why are the twin dragons the symbol of Ionia? Did they had an important role in the past and then vanished into the ghost/spirit world? Did the people of Ionia knew that they existed or was it kind of a fairytale?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{{champion:110}}: Even if portayed as bad, **Varus**  kinda is good. He has such a big potential. Does he support the elders and will fight along **Irelia**  and the other fighters of Ionia or does  he have not enough time for burocracy and strategical thinking? Makes sense to me that he is allied with **Yasuo** . Apparently, **Riven**  is also **Varus'** rival and him and **Yasuo** both want to kill the one that is responsible for killing the ones they wanted to protect. \nWhat happened to the Pit of Pallas? This storyline also kinda is underwhelming. The elders feared that the corruption of the pit could swallow the whole island. So... **Varus**  was kinda the only one guarding the pit? What happened when he had to sleep? Did he ever leave the temple or was that forbidden? When he needed power for revenge, the pit consumed him, and now he is super strong? Was his former power not enough, already being one of Ionias best warriors (why did peaceful Ionia even had warriors back then)? And then the pit gave him power in exchange for lifetime? Now the pit, one of the biggest threats doesn't have a guardian anymore? In my opinion **Varus'** story has to be changed, or the Pit has to get more important, because right now it seems like the Pit of Pallas is just there for the sake of the story of everyones favourite homoerotic, and doesn't get any attention from the other Ionians even though it is a huge threat. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n{{champion:157}} : What does **Yasuo**  think of the Elders? Being a man of honour did he respect their decision to banish him? Or is he angry at them? Were **Irelia**  and **Karma**  already in charge when he got banished? When did the set of Elders change? After Noxus attacked? Or were they changed by force because so many of the former Elders died/failed? Being a protector of an Elder, did he know **Irelia**  and **Karma**  personally or did they become Elders after **Yasuo**  got banished?\n\n\n_______________________________________________\n\n\nIn general I would love to see some more champions with the mantle of decorum. And that the fan-fighter, for whose sake Karma  got stripped off her fans has something to do with her.\n\nIf I'd think about it, I'd probably have around 234823 more questions, but I'll just leave it that way now. Would love to seem some love for the most cultural diverse region of Valoran. \n\nAlso I think that riot needs to create a video series about the general story of League of Legends.

She came out at least over a year ago, and while she's had skins and other things released for her, her lore is probably the weakest I've seen. Hell even Evelynn is tied to the shadow isles in some way as well to a few other champions, which is something. Zyra comes from some place called the Zumungu Jungle(which I only know cause I went to look it up before posting about it). Like, what's the Zumungu Jungle? Is it still relevant, since in the lore it says that everything in it was dying? Do other champs have come/gone to there? And then there's the lore itself. A flower that was dying and took over some random sorceress that happened to be walking by, then goes out to explore. That's it. There's no reason for her given to join the league, no connection to any other champ(which, I think, but not entirely sure of, but think that most other champions at least have connection to AT LEAST One other champion(Save maybe Rammus, which, given I haven't seen too many others post about him, is probably someone who needs their lore expanded on). I understand you guys are looking to promote the popular champions, but in all honesty, if a champion is unpopular for some reason then perhaps they're the ones that need the most help so that they can be loved like the rest.
