However, we didn’t want this to mean Kalista’s story didn’t go out with her launch… so, we are putting her story up here on Boards for now. We hope you like it!\nCheers!\n---\n**Invocation**\n\nThe sword-wife stood amid the burnt out ruin of her home. Everything and everyone that mattered to her was gone, and she was filled with fathomless grief... and hate. Hate was now all that compelled her.\n\nShe saw again the smile on his face as he gave the order. He was meant to be their protector, but he’d spat upon his vows. Hers was not the only family shattered by the oath-breaker.\n\nThe desire to go after him was strong. She wanted nothing more than to plant her sword in his chest and watch the life drain from his eyes... but she knew she would never be able to get close enough to him. He was guarded day and night, and she was but one warrior. She would never be able to fight her way through his battalion alone. Such a death would serve no purpose.\n\nShe took a shuddering breath, knowing there was no coming back.\n\nA crude effigy of a man, formed of sticks and twine, lay upon a fire-blackened dresser. Its body was wrapped in a scrap of cloth torn from the cloak of the betrayer. She’d pried it from her husband's dead grasp. Alongside it was a hammer and three rusted nails.\n\nShe gathered everything up and moved to the threshold. The door itself was gone, smashed to splinters in the attack. Beyond, lit by moonlight, lay the empty, darkened fields.\n\nReaching up, the sword-wife pressed the stick-effigy to the hardwood lintel.\n\n“I invoke thee, Lady of Vengeance,” she said, her voice low, trembling with the depth of her fury. “From beyond the veil, hear my plea. Come forth. Let justice be done.”\n\nShe readied her hammer and the first of the nails.\n\n“I name my betrayer once,” she said, and spoke his name aloud. As she did so, she placed the tip of the first nail to the chest of the stick-figure. With a single strike, she hammered it in deep, pinning it to the hardwood door frame.\n\nThe sword-wife shivered. The room had become markedly colder. Or had she imagined it?\n\n“I name him twice,” she said, and she did so, hammering the second nail alongside the first.\n\nHer gaze dropped, and she jolted in shock. A dark figure stood out in the moonlit field, a hundred yards in the distance. It was utterly motionless. Breathing quicker, the sword-wife returned her attention to the unfinished task.\n\n“I name him thrice,” she said, speaking again the name of the murderer of her husband and children, before hammering home the final nail.\n\nAn ancient spirit of vengeance stood before her, filling the doorway, and the sword-wife staggered back, gasping involuntarily.\n\nThe otherworldly being was clad in archaic armor, her flesh translucent and glowing with spectral un-light. Black Mist coiled around her like a living shroud.\n\nWith a squeal of tortured metal, the spectral figure drew forth the blackened spear protruding from her breastplate — the ancient weapon that had ended her life.\n\nShe threw it to the ground before the sword-wife. No words were spoken; there was no need. The sword-wife knew what was being offered to her — vengeance — and knew its terrible cost: her soul.\n\nThe spirit watched on, her face impassive and her eyes burning with an unrelenting cold fury, as the sword-wife picked up the treacherous weapon.\n\n“I pledge myself to vengeance,” said the sword-wife, her voice quivering. She reversed the spear, aiming the tip inward, towards her heart. “I pledge it with my blood. I pledge it with my soul.”\n\nShe paused. Her husband would have pleaded for her to turn away from this path. He would have begged her not to condemn her soul with this course of action. A moment of doubt gnawed at her. The undying specter watched on.\n\nThe sword-wife’s eyes narrowed as she thought of her husband lying dead, cut down by swords and axes. She thought again of her children, sprawled upon the ground, and her resolve hardened like a cold stone in her heart. Her grip tightened upon the spear.\n\n“Help me,” she implored, her decision made. “Please, help me kill him.”\n\nShe rammed the spear into her chest, driving it in deep.\n\nThe sword-wife’s eyes widened and she dropped to her knees. She tried to speak, but only blood bubbled from her lips.\n\nThe ghostly apparition watched her die, her expression impassive.\n\nAs the last of the lifeblood ran from her body, the shade of the sword-wife climbed to her feet. She looked down at her insubstantial hands in wonder, then at her own corpse lying dead-eyed in a growing pool of blood upon the floor. The shade’s expression hardened, and a ghostly sword appeared in her hand.\n\nAn ethereal tether, little more than a wisp of light, linked the newly formed shade to the avenging spirit she had summoned. Through their bond, the sword-wife saw her differently, glimpsing the noble warrior she had been in life: tall and proud, her armor gleaming. Her posture was confident, yet without arrogance; a born leader, a born soldier. This was a commander that the sword-wife would have willingly bled for.\n\nBehind the spirit’s anger, she sensed her empathy — recognition of their shared pain of betrayal.\n\n“Your cause is our cause,” said Kalista, the Spear of Vengeance. Her voice was grave cold. “We walk the path of vengeance as one, now.”\n\nThe sword-wife nodded.\n\nWith that, the avenging spirit and the shade of the sword-wife stepped into the darkness and were gone.","replies":[{"poster":"Final GirI","date":"2014-11-20T15:36:05.767+0000","up_votes":32,"down_votes":6,"body":"Wow!

Currently, Kallista is a spirit of vengeance, who aids the worthy against betrayers.  To tell the story from her perspective would be rather dull.\n\n*\"This warrior woman wants to make a deal with me.  Her soul for my aid in her revenge.

Imagine a scene where Yorick is near Kallista's grave and tells us about her story, of how she was betrayed by her leaders and became the Spirit of Vengeance.\n\nThat story could also be a tool to answer other questions, like who is the \"Ruined King\" mentioned on {{item:3153}} and more of the story of the Shadow Isles.\n\nThere's wasted potential there and I hate to see it in that state.\n\n>It is a glimpse of something, meant to draw people in, to make people wonder.

I will grant you that.\n\nOn the flip side, I would love to see these characters become more fleshed out and allowed to grow and expand from their \"incomplete\" beginnings.  I'd like to see Amumu find a friend and how he found them.  I'd like to see Riven and Yasuo meet to settle their differences.   I'd like to see what happens to the \"friendship\" between Teemo and Tristana.\n\n>To leave something in wonder is to leave the story in the mind of the reader, YOU  decide how it happened, YOU figure out what the whole story is.

If I did that, I would be writing *fan fiction,* which would be mostly pointless.\n\nWhy should I have to do all the work?  Why can't Narrative tell these stories to an open-ended conclusion before moving on to the next one?  Obviously, these champions cannot be destroyed unless there's a correlation to the game itself, however you can resolve conflicts without character death.\n\n>Not every story is told to the fullest of it's extent.\n\nNot the *good* stories, at the very least.","replies":[{"poster":"deathmaul022","date":"2014-11-23T10:02:09.731+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree.\n\nLeave the lore open ended.

She is shown as one who wants revenge, the first part how she want it (cold and burning) and the second why (the empathy).

At all. This feels like the lore of the Sword-Wife, not Kalista's\n\nWell, I also don't know anything about the sword-wife other than that her family was murdered and now she wants vengeance. I don't think we really got her story, or if we did, it was pretty vanilla. Nothing wrong with a vanilla vengeance story, but you need to spice it up a little, work with that baseline trope a little more deeply. \"You killed my family, I will destroy you!\" is so maximally cliche that if you're going to go that route you really need to do it well. I'm a big fan of tropetastic stories done well, but you've got to do them well. In a way, the most standard stories are among the riskiest: the second your writing gets even a little lackluster, you're going to zone out half your audience, because they'll realize they're reading \"standard story plot #54\" and lose their immersion.\n\nLike, I don't know, give her an alternative. Show her either thinking about the afterlife and what binding herself to Kalista might mean, or show the inner contortions necessary to stop oneself from contemplating something like that. Either would add pathos and realism. Tell us how she knows about Kalista. Maybe even make it a Kierkegaardian moment and have the ritual require her to impale herself, without really *knowing* if Kalista will come, so that there's a chance she'll be ignored and will die meaninglessly. (Maybe the \"trick\" is that she'll only come if, once you realize she's not coming, you curse her for betraying you in your last moments. Too cute? Probably. But at least it would show a risk being taken.) Give Kalista a companion-spirit who appears to those about to make the oath and urges another path. You've got a line in there about how she thinks that her husband would have begged her not to do it, but this is a fantasy setting; you can actually have her husband's soul beg her to come with him instead, or have him join her in vengeance. Or just have her reflect more deeply on the hopelessness she feels, the lack of any sense of \"what now.\"\n\nNow, I recognize that a suicide story is dangerous ground, but if you're going to write a suicide story, write a suicide story. If you're not, then don't write the prologue, and open *in media res* as she and Kalista take vengeance. Have an Inigo Montoya moment. Whatever works.\n\nAs it is, this just feels like it could be reduced to a few sentences.\n\nNone of what I'm writing here is meant to be disrespectful. I know it sucks to have one's writing criticized, but I find that more often than not I'm happier after the revision.","replies":[{"poster":"Andre537","date":"2014-11-20T17:19:27.532+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"Its good writting, thing is, while it is well written, it is not the story  I was hoping for.

There's absolutely nothing interesting, nothing that tells us about her as a person/ghost/entity/whatever. It's just 'you summon Kalista and this is what happened' and I could already tell that from playing with her once.\n\nCan I get some actual backstory? Or anything about her personality besides 'I AM VENGEANCE!' Like, right now, she's a DotA character. Literally, there's a hero called Vengeful Spirit. If you just printed out a list of lines from each character, you'd be hard pressed to guess which is which. But what I mean by 'DotA character' is that she doesn't feel like a real person who exists. Almost all of her lines are focused around a single theme and variations upon that theme, and we have nothing from her lore to disprove that.\n\nThere are some brief hints in her VO that she's an actual person who things have actually happened to, but they're not addressed at all in this piece. Can we get more about that, and less about 'KALISTA IS ANGRY'?","replies":[{"poster":"DG Ashabel","date":"2014-11-21T12:14:18.555+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"As shocked as I am about defending DOTA's delivery, I disagree. Shendelzare does have her own backstory, motivations and personality, and while the latter is largely consumed by her need for vengeance, it's explained fairly smoothly by the fact that she lost *everything* and becoming the Vengeful Spirit was her only choice.\n\nDespite her obsession with vengeance, she still displays concern for her people (*How fare the Skywrath, Dragonus?*), and she shows a hint of longing for what she once was (*May I borrow your wings, Dragon Knight?*) that sometimes turns to murderous jealousy (*I'll tear the wings from your little corpse!*). And she does express a desire to end with her quest one day, however long it will take her. *What was taken from me shall be restored...but the path of revenge is long.*\n\nThe only hint of character shown by Kalista is her chastising Karthus for his obsession with death, which turns hypocritical once you realize that the entirety of her lore is remorselessly murdering good people so she can have an excuse to murder evil people. Even her role as a spirit of vengeance is shallow because she only expresses any hint of sympathy toward good people (Varus and Graves) while verbally attacking villains (Cassiopeia). Kayle essentially tore off Morgana's wings and threw her out, but Kalista shows no concern for that because it would involve showing sympathy for a villain. What's that, Veigar was betrayed and tortured to insanity before resorting to betraying others in order to amass power for his vengeance? Man, who cares, he's homicidal now and expressing sympathy for him might show a hint of complexity to her cause and character.","replies":[{"poster":"Traumlos","date":"2014-11-22T20:43:24.427+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with most everything you said here (aside from the bit about Shendelzare since I don't follow DotA), except for one tiny, tangential thing that isn't even about Kalista- I don't think that Morgana is a villain.\n\nA lot of the older champions have a fair amount of dissonance between their gameplay and their lore/lines, and Kayle and Morgana are guilty of that, in my opinion. Morgana in particular. I actually really like the basis of Morgana's story- not the 'other dimension' bit, or the setup, but I like the relationship between her and Kayle, especially because it actually twists your visual expectations.\n\nYou look at Kayle, you think 'good'. Same with Morgana and 'evil'. Their visuals say one thing, but if you dig deeper, there seems to be more to the story. From Morg's lore:\n\n> One side proclaimed themselves as beings of perfect order and justice, fighting to unite the world under their law and strong central governance. Those that fought against them saw their kin as tyrants, creatures incapable of seeing the larger view, who would sacrifice individuality and freedom for the illusion of efficiency and safety. Morgana was one who fought against what she perceived as the tyranny of her kind, and for that she was branded \"fallen\". Morgana was not innocent, having plumbed forgotten ways to gather forbidden might to become a powerful mistress of the black arts. This goal was driven by her obsession to defeat the general of the opposition's army - her sister, Kayle.\n\nAlthough Morgana has plunged herself into darkness, it was for good reason- to combat the tyranny of her sister. To throw off the shackles of oppression imposed upon her people by their ruling class. To me, that's an incredibly interesting story. And yet, if you look at Morgana's lines...\n\n>\"I'll have my revenge.\"\n>\"They will suffer.\"\n>\"Without mercy.\"\n>\"Share in my torment!\"\n>\"Do not dally!\"\n>\"Feel my pain.\"\n\nIt feels like there's this huge disconnect between her lore and her presentation (which, again, is a common problem with the older champions). Which is a shame because I'm actually quite attached to her lore- the idea of someone being pushed into 'darkness' because it's the 'light' that's overbearing is pretty intriguing. I like tales of sacrifice, and that is a story about someone who sacrificed their own 'goodness', taking on 'taint' so that they could make things better for everyone else. Sort of a Boondock Saints kind of thing. Admittedly, Riot needs to push that angle more with Morgana in order for it to be really effective (maybe using her powers is slowly making her lose sight of her goal? That's a bit similar to something I came up with for Ahri though \\:), but I think the basis is there.\n\nSo, in short, I don't think Morgana is evil. I don't know how Kalista feels about gray morality (especially because Kalista and Kayle are functionally similar in their lore), so she may still react as you predicted there, but. As I said, I couldn't help but jump at the opportunity when I heard someone talking about Morgana being a villain. :P","replies":[{"poster":"CupcakeTrap","date":"2014-11-23T18:22:48.801+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"To quote Area of Defect:\n\n***They call me fallen—I can't help but love it***\n***Since I didn't so much fall as I told Kayle to shove it***\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0Of_BdqAog","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"DG Ashabel","date":"2014-11-20T21:08:48.792+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":8,"body":"Boring and disappointing.

The bit about her being a great leader in life didn't really tell me anything.\n\nBefore anyone makes a snarky comment about \"oh look, CupcakeTrap *wants* surprises now!\"—the introduction of brand new characters is a great time for shock reveals and surprises about those characters, or about previously unmentioned settings. \"Surprising\" us by drastically altering established characters and settings is another matter.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CupcakeTrap","date":"2014-11-20T16:33:56.342+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":3,"body":"Thanks for posting this up while the tech issues are sorted out!\n\nI like Kalista's concept, and this is by no means a poorly written story. This was probably the highlight for me:\n\n> A crude effigy of a man, formed of sticks and twine, lay upon a fire-blackened dresser. Its body was wrapped in a scrap of cloth torn from the cloak of the betrayer. She’d pried it from her husband's dead grasp. Alongside it was a hammer and three rusted nails.\n\nSomehow, it was the mention of the dresser that got me. It's so mundane as to be almost out of place, but it humanizes the character and the setting.\n\nStill, and I do mean this constructively, the story as a whole didn't really draw me in. I feel like it would benefit from, say, something more about how the POV character came to know about Kalista, and a more condensed summation of the ritual itself. Or maybe just fast-forward to the part where Kalista kills the \"oath-breaker\", and put this in as a preface? Might this not be a time when \"telling\" is better than \"showing\"—might it not be more impactful to get this character's story as Kalista takes vengeance?\n\nOr maybe just more dialogue between Kalista and the POV character? There's something to be said for her communicating entirely through \"yo, there's my spear, take it or leave it\", but I think there's material there. Maybe Kalista relives her own pledge of vengeance each time someone invokes her—showing her connecting with this character could be illuminating. The closest we came to that was the bit about seeing how Kalista looked in life, and then there's this:\n\n> Behind the spirit’s anger, she sensed her empathy — recognition of their shared pain of betrayal.\n\nwhich felt (and I apologize for the cliche) rather more \"tell\" than \"show\".\n\nI think this might benefit from some revision. I hesitate to write too bluntly, not least because some people will assume I'm just \"raging at Narrative\", but…the story just felt quite bland, like it was exactly what I was expecting.","replies":[{"poster":"CrazedPorcupine","date":"2014-11-20T18:27:11.394+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"Cupcake, I will totally miss your undying love and fight for decen lore in this game. your posts are always entertaining and full of insight.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Blackwindy","date":"2014-11-20T16:32:15.665+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":6,"body":"However, this is not Kalistas lore, this a short story about a woman who got her whole family killed and summoned Kalista.

Adopting the POV of the sword-wife who takes the oath, we're left with just someone telling about her, describing her through someone else's eyes. We don't get to know anything about Kalista which we didn't know before and since those information are already covered in the short in-client summary, there's no real reason to expand on them in such a way, as opposed to, for instance, the same story approached from Kalista's POV (or told by a third-person omniscient narrator), showing us what she feels about herself, how betrayal disgusts her, her pain and the empathy she has with those who take the oath. That's showcasing the character. The current story and the video are, again, more of a teaser for a marketable product.\nThis is to say, we can't just be confident they'll get better, we must point out to them with feedback when they approach things the wrong way. IoW or no IoW it doesn't matter, the new content as of now wouldn't be shackled by it in any way, the problem is in the narrative approach and it's a much deeper one, independent of the setting. You could have the coolest and most original fantasy setting ever as a basis, if you build on it in the way they did for Shurima, the Harrowing and Kalista, you won't still get anything interesting from a sole narrative POV. And since it was them choosing to separate the game from the story, I'd expect them to strive to give a *narrative product* measuring up with *narrative standards*.\nIf they were not about worldwide known characters of the most played game in the world, no one would ever publish a product made of short stories such as the ones they delivered.\nI mean no offence with this, but I wouldn't ever follow their story if I wasn't hooked to the game and that means that the story doesn't stand on its own, which is a most serious matter if they meant for it to do so.»","replies":[]},{"poster":"Destínum","date":"2014-11-20T16:09:09.515+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":2,"body":"Nice job!

It begs more questions than it answers though, especially when matched against the teasers released for Kalista.\n\nI especially love the implicit stories it's waiting for us ask. Is Kalista a champion, or something like a higher power greater than \"humans\"? In Valoran we have human characters like Lucian who have families. In Lucian's story, however, *he* is the champion. *Thresh* is the champion. Not Senna. In this story, the sword-wife just seems to be an average person calling on higher powers (you can't really deny the vodoo Fiddlesticks reference here -- is this suggesting that Fiddlesticks is also this astral cosmic vodoo thing?). Is this story suggesting that Kalista is being \"called upon\" for her magic, or uh ... summoned, maybe?\n\nThere is also this theme of possession and Kalista often talks between \"we\" and \"I\" in her lines in-game, so perhaps she \"becomes\" people like the sword-wife who call on her and give them her souls. Maybe in a way Kalista is the sword-wife and so this lore is kind of about a piece of her? If the lore is designed to raise curiosity and to inspire prying for more info, this definitely delivers.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DwarvenGiant","date":"2014-11-20T15:52:25.335+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"Great work, I love these short stories!

That concept of calling a name three times to summon her is interesting, but not a new idea. It is rather well known through the legend of the \"Bloody Marry\". Also I think these tendencies to make the champions relatable by adding some sort of emotional investment of the champion  into his lore is becomig too much.\n\nI can not help but feel like there is a certain tendency to give even evil champions a good side. The lore states that Kalista feels empathy for those who seek vengeance for betrayal. She doesnt need to feed on them, she just happens to have shared a similar fate and now wants to bring all those who betrayed others to justice. It might be a twisted way of justice with no clear winners, but its clearly a emotionally motivated action.\n\nWhen you released Azir, we had a lore change for another pair of evil guys, Xerath and Renekton. Even they were originially kind of well meaning. Xerath was a victim of the shuriman circumstances, being a slave and longing for freedom. He even felt sorry shortly before he took the power of Ascension from Azir. And Renekton, the so called butcher of the sands, was once a noble hero who sacrificed his sanity for the shuriman people by dragging the now corrupted Xerath into the tomb. \nEven Sion, a undead battleram, seems to have a emotional side, piting himself, wanting his memories and his old life back. All of these champions, though seemingly evil, have a moralic complexity to them that I do not think of as appealing. \n\nI long for a really evil champion, who is just violent and brutal because he can. Not for the fun that it brings, like Jinx, but because he really likes to kill and plunder, destroy and ravage. \n\nThe closest things we have in terms of such attitudes are propably Vladimir and maybe Darius, but even he has a softer side, shown through him caring for his little brother when they were orphaned. Another example would propably be Brand. But none of these seem to fit that archetype of the evil madman with overwhelming physical presence. Not even Mundo does kill for the sake of violence, but to experiment, similar to Warwick and Singed, scientists in their own right. Maybe the Void champs can be seen as killing machines, but they are but animals, existing only to feed on prey and set free in a new world. They hardly choose to do what they do.\n\nSo instead of making all of the new releases characters who struggle with their past and their emotions, I would welcome more extreme stances. We got a huge roster of champions and it would be a shame if the underlying tones of each lore would be similar.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rafael Merlo","date":"2014-11-24T08:47:12.966+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"This is not Kalista Lore; she barely appears in it.
