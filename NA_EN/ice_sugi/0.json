When I select my champion, I still can only choose from last weeks free rotation and the ones I already own.","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-05-23T23:43:30.403+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is entirely possible that this is due to our announcements vs when the FTP Rotation actually goes live.  It's entirely possible that the announcement went out before the actual changes went through.  The best advice I can give is to sit-tight and give it a chance to update.  If you still don't see the new rotation by tomorrow, be sure to reply back and give me a heads up!","replies":[{"poster":"Ice Sugi","date":"2016-05-24T01:47:24.553+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you, I assumed this was the reason but I didn't find the use of actually giving the announcement early.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"xEtherealLife","date":"2016-05-24T01:20:41.996+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I was wondering the same thing!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ice Sugi","date":"2016-05-23T21:44:12.629+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"idk how much times I have to bump this","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ice Sugi","date":"2016-05-23T21:24:05.260+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bump.
