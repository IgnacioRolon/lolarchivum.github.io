Quints)_\n\n2. **MR+HP on single item was considered VERY strong combination, much stronger than Armor+HP. **\nAD champions can do damage continually, whereas AP mages need to wait for CDs. MR+HP item gives shitload of EHP against magical attacks. This was the reason why MR+HP items were always bad for health of the game and either overpriced or weak. Now it takes just SV to put a HUGE dent into any mage&#039;s damage output. Imagine what will happen when we add 2 more such items, both with very strong passives.\n\n3. **New GA is just as effective against magical as it is against physical nukers. **\nJust because it has 40 armor it doesn&#039;t mean it counters physical damage dealers more. On the contrary, it&#039;s much easier to kill revived target with sustained damage than it is on bursty damage reliant on cooldowns.\n_Suggestion: Ressurected target gains hp equal to 70% of PHYSICAL DAMAGE TAKEN 10 seconds before he died instead of flat 50% max hp_\n\n4. **New Banshee&#039;s is just too strong. **\nIts stats should be strictly defensive, otherwise it will get used as uncounterable safety tool for AP assassins and dive mages such as {{champion:245}} {{champion:84}} {{champion:76}} {{champion:35}} {{champion:131}}{{champion:68}} {{champion:55}} {{champion:85}} . \n_Suggestion: Shield doesn&#039;t ignore first ability that connects, instead it just reduces damage of ability that pops it by 50% and gives 50% tenacity as long as it holds_\n\n5. **HP reduction on tank items while increasing MR is fine. However, we should look at non-tank items giving health as well**\nLooking at you {{item:3748}} {{item:3071}} {{item:3107}} {{item:3151}} {{item:3022}}.\n_Suggestion:  -50 hp wouldn&#039;t hurt them a bit._","replies":[{"poster":"Risk of Fate","date":"2017-04-10T22:07:11.811+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pretty sure Banshee's is the only decent mage item now, everything else is just pointing to rip any burst mage and potentially any other mages/ap assassins simply because Adaptive Helm alone nullifies their ability to take out squishies whom are going to be rushing {{item:3814}} as a second item\n\nWoo, a spell shield, how amazing. Now, let's see our armor options: {{item:3191}} {{item:3047}} {{item:3157}} and if you were desperate enough to build Tabi's, you're essentially cutting yourself in the Achille's since you need all the penetration you can get.\n\nAs any Ahri knows, an Anivia Lane is quite literally the worst because, by the time you do a full rotation of spells to kill, you need to do it again on little to no mana. When Zeds and Talons are getting GA as a core item, good luck to any hope you have for winning or even surviving to get to the mid game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-04-10T21:59:39.482+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{item:3748}} {{item:3022}}  are definitely tank items (FM got HP buffed to it to make it a tank item instead of a yasuo/gnar item - how quickly people forget).
