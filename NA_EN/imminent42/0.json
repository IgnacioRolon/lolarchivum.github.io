I love playing Garen, however he is one of those champions that I&#039;d never pick in a game that I really wanted to win, because there will _always_ a better alternative. There is also the fact that Garen is not a champion who can easily carry or turn around games, and has a distinct lack of ability to make flashy &#039;plays&#039;. This is a cardinal sin for a champion in a role who is intended to be able to chase down and eliminate enemy carries.\n\nWe can begin by examining the core strengths and weaknesses of Garen&#039;s kit.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* Manaless\n* High Durability/Sustain (with his current passive)\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* Very Poor CC\n* Poor mobility\n* No ranged abilities\n* Long windup on Q auto attack (deserves a special mention)\n\nGaren&#039;s #1 problem since the beginning of time has not been his build paths or even his damage late game, it was his lack of reliability against teams with even modest amounts of mobility or peel. Garen&#039;s &#039;tatic&#039; is to run at the enemy champion with a moderate speed buff and try to auto attack them. The nature of the slow cleanse on Decisive Strike (Q) also puts Garens in an awkward position where they can&#039;t catch the enemy champion if they don&#039;t activate it, but if they do it leaves them vulnerable to any CC they may have. Fortunately the added tenacity from Courage (W) active helps counter this vulnerability, but only marginally and only in the cases where the enemy champion isn&#039;t simply using a gap opener instead. This doesn&#039;t allow for much flexibility in Garen&#039;s strategy, and flash is tantamount to a necessity for him.\n\nNow lets break down how the rework affects his gameplay:\n\n**Base Stats:**\n\n*     (Nerf) Health/lvl 96 >>> 84.25\n*     (Buff) AD/lvl 3.5 >>> 4.5\n*     (Buff) Armor/lvl 2.7 >>> 3.0\n*     (Buff) Attack Range 125 >>> 175\n\nA large nerf for his scaling health per level, with modest buffs on his AD and Armor scaling. I don&#039;t understand why they want to cut his health stat so hard. The increased auto attack range is certainly nice for Garen, but not something that&#039;s probably necessary or healthy overall. Melee champions are balanced around 125 range autos, with a few exceptions and generally they should remain there.\n\n\n\n**Passive - Perseverance:**\n\n*     (Nerf) Regen/sec @lvl16 2% max Health >>> 1.6%\n\nHoy boy down comes the axe. Ignoring other sources of regen to make the math easier, with his current passive it takes Garen 54 seconds to reach full HP. 54 seconds is a long time to be out of combat with champions, enough time to die and respawn, or simply recall and reach most places on the map. In contrast it takes a life steal based champion a good one or two creep waves to heal to full hp. In this same patch Riot is buffing Warmog&#039;s to be almost twice as strong as Garen&#039;s passive, so its clear that they don&#039;t deem this an unhealthy mechanic, yet they don&#039;t seem to want to allow Garen&#039;s passive to be strong enough to provide him with the sustain he needs to justify not building Warmog&#039;s. A highly unnecessary nerf at best.\n\n\n\n**Q - Decisive Strike:**\n\n*     (Nerf) Silence Duration 1.5/1.75/2/2.25/2.5 >>> 1.5 all ranks\n\nI&#039;m not sure where to begin with this one honestly. Why touch his one form of CC? CC that isn&#039;t even hard CC. CC that he depends heavily on to land the rest of the damage in his kit. The upshot of this change means that enemies will be flashing/escaping from Garen before he can even finish his E let alone get any extra damage off on his target.\n\n\n\n**W - Courage:**\n\n*     (Removed) 20% increased bonus Armor and Magic Resist\n*     (Added) Killing units permanently grants 0.2 Armor and Magic Resist (1 for champions, large monsters, and epic monsters), up to a maximum of 10/15/20/25/30\n*     (Removed) Active Tenacity component\n\nTalk about being taken to the dumpster. Didn&#039;t Riot say a long time ago that having stacking on his W was a bad mechanic that favored uneven matchups? Either you&#039;re winning lane and you're unkillable, or are getting stomped and you're made out of paper. But to add insult to injury, they put a cap on the stacking mechanic, and no less one that scales per level. No other champion in the game with a similar stacking mechanic has _any cap at all_ on how much they can stack it let alone one that scales per level. Whats the upshot of it scaling per level? Unless you max it early, you&#039;re going to have to continue farming until very late game to get the most out of your kit. But whats the real kicker on it? Even when fully stacked its going to be weaker than the current passive on most Garen builds. \n\nSince they are taking out so much power from the passive component, surely they must be buffing its active right? Wrong. Completely removed the tenacity component. Remember how we have problems getting to enemy carries on teams with strong CC? Yeah, good luck with that now. And to add even more fun, you&#039;re going to be melting even faster than you were before as well. Simply put a bizarre, baffling, unjustifiable nerf.\n\n\n\n**E - Judgment:**\n\n*     (Nerf) Base Damage per tick 10.0/22.5/35.0/47.5/60 >>> 12.0/16.0/20.0/24.0/28.0\n*     (Buff) Total Attack Damage Ratio per tick 0.35/0.40/0.45/0.50/0.55 >>> 0.47/0.49/0.51/0.53/0.55\n*     (Nerf) Base ticks per cast 6 >>> 5\n*     (Buff) Cooldown 13/12/11/10/9 >>> 9 at all ranks\n*     (Added) Judgment&rsquo;s spin speed permanently increases at levels 1/4/7/10/13/16, resulting in a total of 5/6/7/8/9/10 maximum ticks of damage per cast\n*     (Added) Cancelling Judgment early returns cooldown of Judgment equal to the remaining duration of the buff\n*     (Removed) Judgment no longer benefits from Critical Strike Chance or Critical Strike Damage\n*     (Removed) Garen no longer moves 20% slower while moving through minions\n*     (Added) Garen now moves 20% slower while moving toward champions he&rsquo;s hitting with Judgment\n\nI don&#039;t have all that much to say about most of this one, other than it makes calculating the scaling a lot more annoying, and mauls his early game potential. Goodbye to Garen's Riven and Renekton matchups. One change that I do think deserves special mention however:\n\n**(Added) Garen now moves 20% slower while moving toward champions he&rsquo;s hitting with Judgment**\n\nThis one really threw me for a loop. I don&#039;t really think I need to point out why. Considering all the difficulty Garen has just in reaching his opponent, you&#039;d think Riot would at least allow him to stick to his opponent even just a little bit. But nope. Enjoy your new, shorter silences Garen players. But wait, there&#039;s more! You now CC yourself, and make it even more impossible to stick to your opponent _for doing exactly what you are supposed to do_. Bravo Riot. This one really takes the cake.\n\n\n\n**R - Demacian Justice:**\n\n*     (Added) Passive: The enemy champion with the most recent kills is the Villain. Judgment ticks and basic attacks on the Villain deal an additional 1% of its max Health as true damage\n*     (Added) Demacian Justice now deals true damage to the Villain instead of magic damage\n\nSo this is where the new &#039;mechanic&#039; Riot was cooking up comes into play. Saying I&#039;m disappointed would be like saying jumping in an acid bath burns a little bit. It really feels like they were just trying to force something &#039;unique&#039; into the game, no matter how little sense it made or how badly designed it was.\n\nFirst lets analyze this &#039;mechanic&#039; from Garen&#039;s opponents perspective. You weren&#039;t the last person to get a kill. Great. Don&#039;t worry about a thing. But now you just got a kill. Good job, you&#039;re supposed to get kills, and in fact the game rewards you for doing so. But watch out, now Garen has insane % max health true damage procs on you. Did we forget about true damage not always being a healthy design decision or something? So now you have no way to itemize against your opponents damage, you better avoid getting kills from now on. Sounds really fun right guys?\n\nNow lets see it through Garen&#039;s perspective. Short of letting his allies die, Garen has no control over who his kit is going to be effective against. Worse, in a team fight its going to chaotically switch around, so even if he did get onto his Villainous target, it could very easily swap over to another play, without any say from Garen in the matter. Remember when you could play the strengths of your kits based on _your own_ decisions? But this mechanic also introduces another problem for Garen. Lets say a champion like Ahri, Kallista, or Tristana is the current Villian. Good luck reaching them. There are plenty of champions in the game that Garen simply cannot catch unless his opponent misplays horribly. So now you have your passive on a champion you can never reach in a million years, and is completely useless. Does that seem like interesting game play to you? I read a Riot post that said this is supposed to &#039;encourage Garen&#039;s team to help him reach his target&#039;, and I almost laughed. If that&#039;s how limited Garen&#039;s kit is going to be you might as well have another ADC, who can easily do more damage more reliably on your team instead. No one is ever going to get a team built around letting a Garen reach his target, and seeing as how many other aspects of his game play are out of his control, I don&#039;t see why anyone would _want_ to play him in the first place.\n\n\n\n\nI don&#039;t understand why Riot wants to sacrifice Garen&#039;s tankiness and sustain so he can delete an enemy in one spell rotation provided he reaches his target with his very limited kit.  It reduces the viability of his niche and makes him even more one dimensional than he was before. I understand that Riot wants to keep Garen as an &#039;easy to learn&#039; champion. When I heard they were reworking him, I was really excited and hoping that they would introduce something to raise his skill ceiling, while retaining his easy to learn appeal, to give some love to players who play Garen at higher levels. I love Riot and I love League, but it really saddens me to see changes like this proposed to a champion I love so much. I sincerely hope they reconsider this one, and frankly take the rework on Garen back to the drawing board. He deserves better.","replies":[{"poster":"Phuc Dat Bich","date":"2015-08-04T23:58:20.866+0000","up_votes":66,"down_votes":2,"body":"when i see the 20% slow on E i was done...like ok so now if you use E on the enemy the enemy would walk away from you simple because you were be slower by 20%\n\nRITO BALANCE BOYZ \n\nAnd the Q the best !!! garen have only 1 cc and they gut it to 1.5seconds hahahahahahah\n\nThe new W boy that some next level stuff over there 10 armor boy YEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH but you lose Tenacity and damage reduction because you know garen was sooooooooo good at going in and nobody was able to kit him!!\n\nOh boy well i guess garen would be drop at 20% win ratio \n\nI want to know who come with that garen rework because hell this guy need to be fired right now!","replies":[{"poster":"Bouffon dAnglais","date":"2015-08-05T07:36:18.874+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":0,"body":"his winrate wont change. everyone would just stop picking him.","replies":[{"poster":"Taarki","date":"2015-08-05T21:13:26.759+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"When Rito sees that he has a 0% pickrate do you think they will realize they screwed up?","replies":[{"poster":"junglerboy16","date":"2015-08-06T00:21:38.646+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nah, they'll just buff his numbers until people swallow the bait and take him for freelo.\n\nContext: Cassiopeia rework.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"SavemeEric","date":"2015-08-05T01:29:54.311+0000","up_votes":37,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea realistically these changes are shit, it takes away so much diversity from his play style. It is the death of crit Garen and a severe nerf to his snowball potential. It is also a nerf to full tank Garen as his silence on his Q is nerfed as well as his innate tankyness in his W and his late game regen from his passive. These are are things he desperately needs if he falls behind or gets counterpicked so that he doesn't feed. His early game nerfs will also limit his potential as a counter to Riven, Renekton, and other early game powerhouses. We end up with less stickyness, less tankyness,, and less damage that a full crit garen. This forces us down a linear build bath of brawler. The new Ult passive is also gimmicky and will make it harder on new players learning tom focus the carry. Now they will attempt to kill whoever is marked even if it is a 5k tank Sion with his passive up. Overall this is a serious nerf to Garens; playability, tankyness, stickyness, damage, and diversity. They are essentially making him mediocre at everything instead of allowing him to build what he wants to be good at situationally. Right now he is not in a bad place as he can try to snowball early and failing that transition to a tank or brawler. After these nerfs I really feel he wont be nearly as viable or diverse.","replies":[{"poster":"SavemeEric","date":"2015-08-05T03:20:42.821+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"I also forgot to mention the new skin a lot of people bought right before they announced all these changes... seems super shady.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Meeks011","date":"2015-08-05T13:42:21.250+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I entirely fail to see any strengths to the new Garen.

And because you don't WANT to die, it's league instincts, you'll go back to base like a good boy and give up the lane.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HayRoss","date":"2015-08-05T04:21:31.438+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"(I'm level 14, I suck at this game, and I don't understand anything that these high-level people are talking about, so please bear with me)\nOkay, from what I knew about the old Garen, he was:\n-Moderately to very tanky (Depending on builds)\n-Can deal decent damage with high AD items\n-Slow\n-Lacks CC\n-With Warmog's armor, has health regen like he's playing Call of Duty\n-Rather simple\n\nSo now with the changes, he's pretty much the same, but:\n-Is less tanky\n-Deals less damage unless they just killed an ally, in that case Garen will destroy them into a small pulp\n-Even slower\n-Has even less CC\n-Less health regen for no reason\n-Abilities pointlessly more complex\n\nSo other than a pretty cool gimmick (I like the concept of it, the execution (No pun intended) is poor), the buffed Garen too much in one area and made him shit in everywhere else?

It's still an impressive amount, but it is an astonishingly brutal nerf of -80 HP5 for the average late game Garen.\n\nQ nerf *kind of* makes sense based on their whole goal of low CC but high durability and damage. It's a big nerf, but it would be warranted if they followed up with the buffs they said he'd be getting.\n\nW: I just, I mean, like **WTF**. There that is my analysis. Ok, serious mode, this change makes zero sense. Remove his bonus armor and MR? Really? The thing in his kit that emphasized his intended role as a super tanky damage threat? the thing that already fit in perfectly with their goal for the new Garen? Stacking Armor and MR for killing creeps? Woo, it does the same thing as the old passive but forces you to farm and max the ability to get it to stack before late game. Passive gameplay and invisible power, but a lot less intuitive (\"kill creeps to get tanky\" vs \"Garen gets tanky when you build tanky items on him\") Removed Tenacity? Ok, I can't be alone in that I *expected* this to go sooner or later (the last several times Rito made changes to champs with in-built Tenacity like Mundo, they removed it when reworking the ability), but on Garen, the champ who basically *needs* that tenacity to not get kited into the ground, this is basically a nutpunch.\n\nSpeaking of getting kited into the ground, E changes. These are kind of a mixed bag. They added *far* too much counterplay when the easiest and best fix for \"we need him not to slaughter you in lane but still be relevant in teamfights\" was to simply have the minion slow scale down with rank hitting 0% at max rank. *EASY* fix that keeps his early game in check (could even be tuned to slow him more than live at early ranks) but allows his late game to open up some, not this BS slowed when approaching enemy champs (as if he weren't kitable enough already). Reduced damage per tick but increased spin rate basically cancel out in terms of total damage, but allow his % health damage to be applied more aggressively than if they didn't make this adjustment (also a buff to Garen using BC, which is good). Removal of Crit synergy is something I expected all along, since they want his damage to be essentially self sufficient (buy BC and your damage is set for the whole game as opposed to RNG Crit damage reliance), basically meaning he doesn't have the same issues of having to choose damage or durability, which used to leave him as either too squishy and easily blown up, or lacking damage and easily ignored.\n\nR changes are all good in my opinion (especially the new indicator showing when the villain is in execute range) true damage against the fed enemy is always a plus.\n\n**TL;DR:** these changes are for the better in my opinion, but W needs to be reverted (all the changes do basically nothing to his balance and add unnecessary gameplay complexity for no real improvement in the interactivity of his kit), the passive nerf needs to be reverted (it makes no sense in *any* context to nerf it) and the E self slow needs to be based on minions and then decrease to 0% with rank).\n\nEDIT: These changes will functionally make Garen serve as Mundo V 2.0, a champion designed to build full tank and rely on his natural damage to do anything. We already have Mundo for that, and Garen won't really be that great since he won't even have poke like Mundo does.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DreamReaper123","date":"2015-08-05T16:27:58.545+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm really disappointed about the removal of crit garen","replies":[]}]}
