I have replicated this issue on two different accounts that I play on daily. I even went to change my password, and found 2 things. Firstly, when I input my current password just to test, it told me that my new password cannot be the same as my old one (i.e. the one I was trying to log in with was still recognized by this system as valid). Secondly, that the new password I changed it to was still kicked back as incorrect. Is anyone else having this issue? I will submit a ticket and update with findings if so.\n\ninb4 check for caps lock and shift key\n\nIf it helps, I was booted out of a game in loading screen by bugsplat and had to get bugsplat out of the way before this login issue began.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-23T17:29:43.879+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The login error might be due to a patch mis-match, but a client restart should fix it.  The bugsplat sounds a bit more serious though, which can be caused by bad drivers or game files.
