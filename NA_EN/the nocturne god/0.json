It makes no sense to have to play a promotion series, basically 3 games that don't really count towards anything, to get into a tier that your MMR is already a full tier ahead of. They need to make it so that either you catch up to your actual rank faster or they make it so that for promotion series you just go vs whatever rank you are promoting into, regardless of MMR. \n\nI won my series though, P1/D5 MMR = still easy.","replies":[]}]}]}
