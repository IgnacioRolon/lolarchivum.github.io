However, you can still edit/create them on the Legacy Client, hop into a custom match to confirm they've loaded up, then move over to the Beta Client where they should still load into game. So technically you can use item sets in the new client, you just cannot edit or create them in the new client. Below is a screenshot showing where you can launch into the Legacy Client from the Beta Client's login screen:\n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/215576628/Launch-Legacy-Client.jpg\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[{"poster":"Legendsofthedark","date":"2016-11-21T07:51:25.760+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Any estimates on when we could expect them in the new client as well?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-21T21:46:33.134+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Due to a number of factors, it's still unknown if item sets will make it to the new client as a feature, as mentioned in [this thread](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/f/3ErqAdtq/d/aWRfq6Ze?comment=00050007).

Then I found this.... :)  \n\nWILL THE UPDATED CLIENT HAVE THE SAME FEATURES AS THE CURRENT CLIENT?\nThe updated client is where we'll release all new client features (like Replays), and there are a few things that may take a few patches to to re-implement after open beta gets going. One feature that isn't being immediately brought over from the legacy client are item sets. However, your existing item sets will still continue to work and our third-party API will sitll allow you to download custom item sets from community developers for in-game use.","replies":[]}]}
