The red flags had to do with the DNS returning addresses that weren't actually there and the yellow flag stuff had to do with some kind of FTP Proxy thing. So any advice on how to not use this proxy?

Is there a specific % it happens?

Unless your hard drive is out of space, getting an error at 60% suggests a network problem.  More specifically, your connection is too weak and backtracking so it can't download the game files without having hiccups.  My suggestion would be to over each step of the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to help troubleshoot.  This isn't an issue with your IE or browser, but how your connection is reaching the patching server.  Let me know if that clears things up!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Prognite","date":"2017-04-11T23:42:51.661+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just used the league forum with the general fixes where it says to check Internet Explorer offline mode, the DNS settings and so on. I didn't write down the exact error and I cannot replicate it because I can no longer download the game. Every time I tried to login it didn't work, and every time I try to re-download the game it gives me \"Unspecified error\" about 60% of the way through the download. I used the Hextech Repair Tool to do a clean uninstall and it still didn't work","replies":[]}]}]}
