I am able to play league of legends perfectly in home 1 but in home 2, I always bugsplat and cannot play whatsoever.  There is nothing wrong with my laptop/game client as I can literally go to my other home to play so I assume there is a problem with my internet in home 2.  I am able to play every other game perfectly fine, however, I bugsplat when I try to play league.  I have even connected a LAN cable between my laptop and my modem, yet, I still bugsplat.  Any suggestions?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-17T21:26:34.683+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you on the updated client?  If so, do you have any issues at all on the legacy client?  It's really rare the a bugsplat would occur due to a connection issue, so your issue is really strange to me.
