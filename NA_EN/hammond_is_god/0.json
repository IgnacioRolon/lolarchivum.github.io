I am kinda disappointed, as I was really close to getting a champion shard that I could infuse with essence.

I found that you unlocked a PROJECT: Yi Icon summoner icon and 150 orange essences.   Your icon was automatically unlocked, so you didn't have to combine any resources to create it.  Let me know if that clears things up!","replies":[]}]}
