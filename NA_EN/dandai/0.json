I play league on a 13' Macbook air and the mac client (not perfect) has more or less treated me well\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}} \n\nAs of patch 6.19 a new network issues has been giving me grief and after many attempts of trying to fix it I have concluded that it may be a client/game issue.\n\n**Problem:** The client runs fine, and usually for the first 3-6 minutes of the game my ping is at a consistent 33ms. However around the 7-10 min mark my ping rises to around 250-400 and remains this way for the rest of the game. Thus earning me several Low priority Qs across several of my accounts.\n\n**Reasoning:** When i first came across this issue i paid very close attention to my ping and internet speeds via \"internetspeedtest by ookla\" as well as the google one. Before loading into the game, during champ select my internet speed is around 15-25mbs depending the hour of the day. The moment I load into Summoners Rift the internet speed drops to 0.04 to n/a mbs.\n\nAt first i thought this may have been a peak hour internet usage issue via my ISP. However i have tried playing in the morning 8am, afternoon 2pm and late night 1-2am and the issue kept reoccurring.\n\n**What i have Done:** Updated my os, Troubleshooted my Router, repaired client, re-installed client\n\nnothing so far has worked and not being able to play is making me feel sad.\n{{sticker:zombie-nunu-tears}} \n\nWorth nothing: Custom games where i was bymyslef also had ping at around 400ms\n\nIs there anything I can do to attack this problem?\n\nAppreciate the help!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-23T17:45:38.241+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The sudden lag spikes could certainly be due to a connection issue, and would result in input delays while in-game.
