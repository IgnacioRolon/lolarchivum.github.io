It looks like your local connection at home is having a really tough time, at +300 ping.  I know you've done some troubleshooting already which is great, I also recommend running through the steps in the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to tune up your home network.

If the logreader didn't show any issues, run a traceroute with [WinMTR](http://winmtr.net/winmtr-v0-92-now-available/) to see if there might be a routing issue.  Route it to the NA game server 104.160.131.1 for about 5 minutes.  Take out the IP for your first two hops, and let me know the results.","replies":[]}]}
