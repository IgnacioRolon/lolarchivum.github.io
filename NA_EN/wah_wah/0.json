No champion portraits pop up and I get a page telling me the client stopped responding and it crashes.\n\nIt goes back to the client with the reconnect button after this.\n\nSometimes I get lucky and I get through after restarting the client or just spam clicking reconnect -> close -> reconnect repeat.\n\nIs there any known fix for this? So far I have reinstalled the client twice and run the repair tool twice, and done the flushdns process in the command prompt.  It's extremely infuriating not being able to connect to ranked games and losing LP for something I cannot control.\n","replies":[{"poster":"QUANTEYES","date":"2016-09-27T05:26:07.392+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Was this after a Windows 10 Anniversary Update?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-27T22:28:25.542+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like this may be caused by one of the recent windows updates that changed some features inside the OS.
