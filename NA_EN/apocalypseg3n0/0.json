After I finished a game of Karthus a picture of Aatrox appeared and I thought that It was supposed to display art of the champion.

You're definitely right on this one! This is a legacy issue that we're aware of, but basically what happens is, there's a connection error finding the proper splash, and since Aatrox is the first splash in the folder, it defaults to that. ;_;","replies":[]}]}
