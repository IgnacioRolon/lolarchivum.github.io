He's the first champion I consider perfect for me based on design, lore, theme and playstyle (with very unique things going on there). I'm sure Riot's approach to his rework is making his Voidlings a more defining factor in combat while loosening his edges around his ult for more counterplay. Let me just say. . . DONT DO IT! I as an AP malz player often forget about the voidling after a few levels and I would hate if riot revolved his kit on using them for combat and this subtracted power from the rest of his kit. I am person who likes consistency (it's my nature) I don't think it'd be fair to malz to put a large sum of his power into an aspect of his kit he has limited control of.  At least annie can control tibbers :/ Also I can argue that Malz ultimate is great as it is. He is a slow mage with an ult that is single targeted and makes him completely immobile. A good malz player must have a strong sense of when and where when utilizing ult in teamfights. His ult is really what ties the synergy of the rest of his kit together and is the only CC this immobile mage has. He is great and to me is the best creation of Mage/Assassin after {{champion:103}} I've seen to date, {{champion:7}} is the worst. You really feel the intensity when playing against a Malz player... and feel the surge of power when playing with him.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ExecutorDill","date":"2016-01-26T16:49:30.464+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=AuFA9cyT,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-01-26T08:43:50.004+0000)\n>\n> Current expectation is that there'll be visual updates to support kit changes, but not otherwise.

I may be asking for much here since it'll affect all his skins but I think his claws are a bit too big :/","replies":[]},{"poster":"Blackquill","date":"2016-01-26T11:38:36.122+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the reply!
