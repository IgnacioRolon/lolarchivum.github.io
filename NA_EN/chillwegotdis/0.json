Another guy calls top, but I said \"I called first and I'm also picking before you, so I get top, sorry.\"  He insists that he should be top.  But whatever, this type of thing happens all the time.  I pick top, and then of course, the guy also picks top champ (again, AFTER I picked top champ).  Here's the kicker: You would think the rest of the team would chastise him, right? NOPE.  They come after me.  They're like \"you idiot, why do we have two tops?\"  \r\n\r\nI calmly said \"please just read the chat, I called it first and picked top first, please direct your frustration at him, blah, blah, blah, logic, logic, facts, facts\"  Doesn't matter, it turns into a wolf pit and I'm the lamb.  The silver lining is that I at least knew my teammates were stupid/toxic.  So dodged it, and only wasted 4 minutes instead of 40 minutes.","replies":[]}
