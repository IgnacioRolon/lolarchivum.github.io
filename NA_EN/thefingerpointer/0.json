Constantly blaming the game on them, reminding everyone they're trolling, telling them to stop talking, and telling them their life is sad is way too far in the direction of insults, belittling comments, and inappropriate levels of ally blaming.","replies":[{"poster":"TheFingerpointer","date":"2018-05-02T15:48:45.154+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"i do see what your saying there!

Regardless of whether you are an adult or a child, however, you will find that many businesses and social situations do not allow you to rant and blame other people without being asked to either change your behavior or leave. If you start consistently insulting someone at a movie theater, for example, they will not simply tell that person to put on earphones, because it is not that person's responsibility to find a way to avoid you're prohibited behavior.\n\nIn short, the mute button is a defense against toxicity, but it does not exist as an excuse to allow it merely because there is a way to avoid it. I understand that having someone on your team who is intentionally feeding is an infuriating and frustrating experience, but that does not justify the sort of response you showed to the situation.\n\nThe adult argument is not an especially good one, but if you seek to use it then I would recommend trying to be the adult in the room in that sort of situation, and handling your frustration gracefully without resorting to blaming or belittling or insulting other players.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-05-01T22:53:51.758+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"You spent the whole game flaming multiple people uncontrollably from the start.
