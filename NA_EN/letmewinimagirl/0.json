You or internet security has probably deleted the file. i spent a week searching for a solution downloading all sorts of stuff which lead to dead ends. i found a solution which has worked for me and i'm able to play league once again. I used a 16GB jumpdrive just to be safe to make sure the game would fit\n\n\nYou will need a second computer or a friends computer to help you with this, Also a jump drive or stick with 8GB space.\n\nFirst uninstall all files to do with league off of your computer .\nYou then need a jump drive with at least 8GB\nUse the jump drive on your friends pc or another PC that has a fully patched league of legends that is currently working and copy the (Riot Games file) in the C:Drive and paste into the jump drive.\nThen insert jumpdrive in your computer and transfer file from jump drive to desktop.\nwhen file is done open riot games off desktop-League of legends. and left lol.launcher.exe and create shortcut and game should open up fully patched hope this helps people.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CrazFight ","date":"2016-04-16T02:41:00.763+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"R041 here from Riot Games Technical Support, thank you for being patient. Typically, problems like this are caused by blocking or disturbing the Patcher from connecting to our servers to grab the files it needs. You should see the MB remaining displayed. If this number is changing then you are still patching properly. You simply need to leave the patcher open wait for the patch to complete. Here are a couple of common fixes that could help:\n\n1. Please temporarily disable any and all Firewalls or AntiVirus applications you have running. These may block the connection between the client and server. This KB article will help you.\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#wq3\n\n2. Are you on a Public DNS? The route may not be optimized properly, you can switch to a Public DNS by following this:\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664#wq5\n\n3. If you're on a Wireless Adapter, please be aware that playing on Wi-Fi is not a stable connection for gaming. It is prone to interference and can cause you to lose packets and increase your latency.\n\n4. If possible, please reset your Modem and Router (This will disconnect anyone else using the network), your home network may be buffering and losing packets, this could be due to faulty Hardware or just a much needed reboot! If possible, you can also try playing League while directly connected to your modem, this will let us know if it's your router possibly having issues.\n\n5. You may have excessive packet buffering. This can be problematic when your router or internet connection cannot handle all of the bandwidth and cause your connection to League of Legends to fail in various ways. Some third-party applications that can contribute to high buffering rates are Skype, P2P Applications such as uTorrent, Hamachi, and audio/video streams. Closing these applications may help reduce the strain on your network.\n\n6. It couldn't hurt to try running a Clean Boot to see if any of the applications were causing problems, here's a quick guide for that: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974#wq7\n\nIf you're still experiencing problems after these instructions, I will need to see specific log files. I linked an app called HRT that will assist in gathering the logs:\n\nDownload the HRT here: https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/player-support/tools/Hextech%20Repair%20Tool.msi\nInstall the HRT as admin\nRun the HRT from your desktop as admin\nPress Start\nWait for the tests to run and attach the results (LoL Logs) as a zip folder to your response. These should be on your desktop after the test.\nI'd also like to see Trace logs using a program called WinMTR. I have attached a Zip file containing the program in my reply. Simply Unzip the contents and run the x32 version, if that version does not work then use x64. In the Host field, enter in the following addresses one at a time and select Start.\n\n192.64.170.252\n104.160.131.1\nGoogle.com\n\nAfter the trace is running for 5 minutes, select Export TEXT and save the log as a text file. Run the test for both IP addresses and attach the logs to your reply. Afterwards you are safe to close the program.\n\nAs well as a Network Analysis: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752674#wq1 [Does not work on Chrome, if this does not work in other browsers, please follow the steps under 'Java Issues']\n\nR041,\nRiot Player Support\nTechnical Support","replies":[]},{"poster":"CrazFight ","date":"2016-04-15T02:15:51.762+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I sent a ticket in about a day ago because Ive had the same problem, Ill tell you guys any info they give me.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Riot Morgageddon","date":"2016-04-14T23:32:00.323+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heyo,\n\nSounds like there could be a conflicting program preventing it from being properly installed or run, a firewall perhaps?
