Not extremely game-breaking, and it possibly could&#039;ve just been the one game, so I&#039;ll need to test it again.\nYou can use this bug infinitely, although it isn&#039;t really worth doing it.\n\nPeople could possibly abuse this by spamming q constantly while autoattacking. This would be a real pain, but would still abuse the bug.\n\nSteps to reproduce;\n1) Get below 20 mana in your mana pool as Jinx.\n2) Press Q to equip rocket and autoattack a target.\n3) You're mana will drop to 0 unless you're above 20 mana. The autoattack will still fire as if it was a rocket with the proper amount of mana.\n4) Jinx will instantly switch back to Powpow once she fires the autoattack.\n5) Press Q again to fire one autoattack Q rocket.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-01-13T23:25:10.458+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hiya! \n\nLooking at the [6.1 patch notes](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-61-notes) - *Fixed a bug where Jinx was able to cast rockets for free when out of mana.*\n\nLooks like it should be okay in 6.1! ^-^ Thanks for the report!","replies":[{"poster":"Krys Star","date":"2016-01-14T00:45:27.309+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey KateyKhaos, did you ever manage to forward and get the item set bug fixed?
