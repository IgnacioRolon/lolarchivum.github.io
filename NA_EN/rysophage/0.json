It's the only thing that crushes tanks, as they build both health and resistances. Removing all flat damage (including vayne's base ad)  is a definite nerf for that choice against all targets, especially squishies. Making the percent higher makes it a big buff against tanks, but still a big nerf against squishies.\n\nThe 10sec cooldown is probably too low. She shouldn't be changing it mid fight. Maybe 15sec, and cooldown gets increased to 5sec if below that (but above 0) and she's in combat.\n\nThe point being to give her specialization (so if she is using the right bolt for the target she'll be stronger than live) but make her need to make that choice properly.

You have LW, BC, and botrk to deal with tanks. No-one should have %HP true damage just because muh adc. It ruins the point of tanks and is unfun in general.\n\nThat's a discussion for a different thread.\n\nThe point of my post is that if you remove all of the flat damage (including Vayne's base AD) then it's not a buff to her. Giving optionality in return for any individual option being weaker than what she has currently in some way (but situationally it can be more useful) is a change, not a buff. \n\nAs for how the discussion would go in another thread? People will comment that without that damage, you have tanks taking over the game, where no one is killable and there's no reason to play anything but a tank. I honestly think we need tank killers and am glad they exist to do their job, **even as someone who's favorite patches of league were the cinderhulk meta**.\n\nI love tanks in league, and would rather have tanks on my team than any other role. I also dread going into games where the enemy has 3+ tanks (especially when they have something like a Galio or Gragas or Malphite mid lane) because if you don't crush early it's practically a guaranteed loss. People go on and on that the game is dictated by the ADC (and sure, those games the ADC is doing all the damage on their team as they have 4 allies permanently locking down all their enemies), but really it's tanks that make the bigger contribution, ADCs just get the nice looking score, the gold, and the damage. Even with champions like Vayne and Kog'maw, tanks still do their job well. It's a lot more about their ability to reliably lock down targets, than it is about them eating thousands of damage every few seconds and surviving. Defensive stats give tanks a lot of buffer room (and notably time to do multiple CC rotations), but a good tank with a good team won't lose much health at all because the damage dealers will be CC'd and killed before they get the chance to bust the tank. Give them too much tankiness and eventually the buffer turns into a guarantee, and that's unhealthy. Having tank shredders helps ensure that tanks still need to get that CC off in a reasonable time to win the fight.","replies":[{"poster":"IkBenShteen","date":"2018-05-16T12:05:27.139+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Still this keeps in the question. Should ADC's be the honeypots of league that supposedly do all of this with right clicking and barely any skill involved? Kiting a tank (given you have a janna support or something) is so damn easy, and the damage is currently so high that defensive stats don't really mean much. Given mundo and a few others that have mad regen, also tahm with his double health bar, sure we need some tankbusting adc's. Does that mean they should defeat tanks with a built in %hp true damage trick? Not really.\n\nEither change the W to %hp in physical damage, even magic for all I care, but allow for tanks to counterbuild it (to a given point). Honestly it's a gigantic meme that anything shreds tanks these days. The itemization of tanks is expensive, they don't do that much damage (ignore galio etc hence those are more like AP bruisers to me) and their items get countered by some nonsense ability that chunks mad health. I'm not saying ADC's shouldn't be able to defeat tanks, i'm saying they shouldn't be able to do it unless far ahead or with a support. They are supposed to be squishy damage dealers with high damage capability and strong lategames. Not early monsters that just 1v1 you with no chance to actually deal damage to them before they healed back up to max due to the sickening amount of sustain currently in the game.\n\nVayne is supposedly someone who hunts enemies, her kit screams this. It doesn't mean she should be able to ignore tanks. Again a vayne that builds attackspeed only can still chunk your health away without any AD items. It just amazes me how people think this true damage %hp mechanic is healthy. Not to mention the conquerer bullshit. It should all be removed imo. I understand ADC's should take down tanks. Just not in 5 seconds. They are supposed to be raid bosses and take huge chunks of damage to tank for their squishy teammates. Not be a big ball of health that takes 5s to munch through.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Bob the Toastr","date":"2018-05-15T02:22:53.254+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"Good idea but it needs to have a decent cooldown (30+ seconds) so she has to plan ahead for the situation she's going to be in.

It's not that much damage...\n\nSomething to realize as well: There really isn't much \"Tank\" anymore vs AD carries. Armor shred is just too accessible on all roles. Even if an AD carry doesn't get {{item:3071}} , their allies DO. which means a {{item:3036}} just takes away almost all armor.\n\nIn a game where you naturally might have 70 Armor, but built 300 Armor, You're likely lowered to 56 or so Armor after all armor reductions/ignored are applied. \n\nHP is more tanky than Armor. That's where the game is now.","replies":[{"poster":"IkBenShteen","date":"2018-05-16T12:21:03.822+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeh and stacking HP will just boost her W damage output so that is already negated :P Not to mention it is not a current health reduction, it's max health. And with the upcoming changes to BOTRK, it will be even worse for HP stacking tanks. There's so much shit to deal with tanks, just build pen. Yet no real itemization to defend from such mechanics as mr and armor just get shredded these days. Stacking hp is just useless as you become a giant meatball that people grind through.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Mannny","date":"2018-05-16T11:27:42.971+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like the idea but it may do the exact opposite of what you want.
