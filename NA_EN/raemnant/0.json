I have learned that when you're in lane, it is best to not rely on your jungler. Don't expect him to come in and feed you, don't expect him to come in and save you. Yes, that's a junglers job, and they SHOULD do that, but don't expect it. \r\n\r\nTreat your lane as a 1v1, or a 2v2. Its you versus your enemy, and its your job and your job only to overcome, and defeat your opponent. The jungler is a wild card. He may or may not show up, may or may not die, or get you kills, so play as if he isn't there, until he actually shows up. The only time you can blame your jungler is if he runs straight at the enemy when he should not have, and feeds them a free kill, fighting something he shouldnt be, or trying to dive.\r\n\r\n If he isn't ganking for you, play more defensively. If his ganks are failing, try and poke the enemy more. Adapt to your situation. As long as YOUR opponent isn't ahead of you significantly, you can still win. Keep your own lane warded, stay aware of THEIR jungler, and do not die. If you want to say \"/all hurdur my jungler sucks. No ganks bot lane while xxxxx has been down here 7 times\" well tough luck. At least you're still alive, and your jungler is probably just farming the jungle for gold. He'll be an asset mid-late game. Not to say he shouldnt try ganking, but if he isn't, then he isn't that type of player, and you have to accept that, and play accordingly.\r\n\r\nYou don't need to kill your opponent to win the game. You don't earn gold just by killing the enemy champions, the game isn't about which team kills the other the most. Just farm, ward, stay alive, and make plays later on, when the team groups up. That's all you can do","replies":[{"poster":"LupusNox","date":"2014-11-17T04:32:36.145+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really hate when people expect the jungle to be a part of their lane\n\nPlaying a lane means that you are playing vs your opponent(s) and your jungler/their jungler is just a wild card.  Your main job is to win that 1v1/2v2, and if your losing, thats your fault, not your junglers.\n\nWhen I play jungle and I see a lane losing, I tend NOT to gank them, simply because the risk of it backfiring is so much higher.  I will get the lanes that are even or winning an even further advantage so that they will snowball and make up for our lane that is behind.  If the player is behind in lane has any sort of game knowledge, he will play defensively and try to just stay even somewhat in farm.  I'd rather have someone that is behind 20-30 or even 50 farm mid-late game than someone or is behind that same amount of farm but is also down 2-3+ kills in lane.\n\nJungling isn't just about ganking for your lanes;  there are many facets to a good jungler.  Farming your jungle, ganking, counterganking, knowing where their jungler is so you can countergank, warding, objective/buff control, knowing where their wards are and when they expire, invading, etc.\n\nSaying that \"my jungler noob no ganks GG\"  is such a bad way to play off the fact that you don't know how to play your lane","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lowvyr","date":"2014-11-16T23:21:44.702+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"As a jungle main, let me clarify something:\nI won't ALWAYS get you a kill. If I don't, don't whine and bitch at me. I might need the kill more than you, or I might just blow their flash. Be grateful that I took the time out of my jungle route, sacrificing precious gold, and opening up my jungle for counter-jungling, to come up there and help you. If I feed them a kill, then yes, tell me to stop coming up there, and I will. If I get you a kill, I'm taking a few minions. It's called \"Minion Tax\".\nAlso, if I'm playing a champion such as Warwick or Rengar, and I rely on my ult to gank, don't bitch and complain at me if my ganks don't do shit when I'm below 6. If you know that I'm that kind of champion, or if I state before the game-of-record actually happens that I'm going to hard farm to 6, play safe until I hit 6, and then ping when you want me to go in.\n\nAnd another thing that pisses me off:\nIf you ping the enemy laner, and tell me to go in, but then don't go in, and I die, don't blame me. You should have went in when I did if you pinged them. I'm tired of laners seeing jungling as the easiest role in the game. In all honesty, it's the hardest. Not all too many people are actually great at it. Some jungle champions are very hard to play (Elise, Lee Sin), some are a little difficult (Kha'Zix, Rengar), and some are super easy (Warwick, Master Yi), but in the end that's not the actual issue. The issue with jungling, is that you are responsible for ganking, objective control, map pressure, and setting the enemy jungler behind enough as to take him out of the game, or at least force him to farm and not gank. It's not that easy to do all that at once. Just go try jungling if you've never done it before, or barely ever play it. It's not as easy as it looks.","replies":[{"poster":"semthews","date":"2014-11-20T01:26:16.716+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Except when you have the warwick syndrome afflicted leesin  who is  0/0/1.

Forcing summoners, forcing out of lane, taking an objective, are all successful ganks. Sure, the kill is preferable, but anything that gives your team the advantage to pull further ahead is successful. And, yes, sometimes this means not ganking. I tend to pick up a Sweeper, and if I show up and kill a ward (especially a bought ward!), I'll leave for a bit (unless the enemy lane stays out of position), but I just gained money for our team while denying money they spent, and forcing them to have to play more carefully, allowing my team to zone them/force them out of lane/whatever.\n\nIn other words: Capitalize, lanes. Play as if the jungler wasn't there, keep yourself aware of the enemy jungler, ward ward and ward some more, and take every advantage your jungler does give you - because even something as small as a ward clear gives you an advantage. And that's something a lane can always use.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Alljoy","date":"2014-11-16T08:24:34.434+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Take my upvotes.\n\nJust take it.","replies":[{"poster":"Raemnant","date":"2014-11-16T08:40:17.056+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you, good sir.

Doing ok while getting camped is even better, and forcing the top/jungle/mid to be constantly converging on you and not getting any kills out of it means you're going to climb extremely quickly.\n\nHere's a tip for top laners, since it's usually top that complains about lack of ganks: when you see the enemy jungler come to your lane, ping it and tell your jungler it's safe to go bot/do dragon. Then try to keep the enemy jungler top as much as possible, so as to keep him away from dragon/bot. If I'm against a top/jungle duo that needs to gank a total of 9 times just to get 2 kills off me (I really have no idea what those 2 were doing, but I can confirm that deep wards are OP in that situation) and dragon is still up at the end of that, my jungler really isn't doing his job at all.

I know I have 1 major issue with my laning (other then last hitting..but a lot of people still suck at that honestly lol) and that is that I'm way to passive. The only champions that I play top lane that I actually go full aggressive is Yasuo and Lee Sin (probably because of their dashes, and no mana). Facing champions top lane that have good sustain is really my biggest weakness for top lane since I'm not really aggressive enough to poke them down more then they can heal. Because of this, I can never really shut down a Nasus...Especially since 90% of the times I face a Nasus, I happen to pick Shyvana which can easily beat him early but then he'll sit under tower with life steal and get back to full from 1 minion wave...And you can't kill/stop him unless you tower dive or have a Jungler (At least with a melee champion like Shyvana).\n\nThen again, being to passive isn't really all that bad. I generally go even in almost all my lanes and if my jungler does come top then usually win it. I also should start to get into the habit of split pushing as well since I pick some champions top lane who are great for it (Yasuo, Shyvana, Warwick etc).\n\nMid lane, I'm a lot more aggressive once I know I can out-damage my opponent, like when I pick Anivia I'll try to wait for level 6 to all in (unless I actually land my Q).\n\nBut anyways, yea I do agree people really do need to stop relying on their Jungler all the time. I think my friends really like when I go top, because since I'm actually passive...I usually don't die against my lane opponent (unless their jungler comes) and most of the time, they push me to my tower so it's easy for my Jungler to gank. Also because I know that if my opponent is stronger than me, play safe and sit under tower until help comes or until they get greedy and tower dive.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GoldenLeSpoink","date":"2014-11-16T12:50:36.628+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think that the junglers have the most important job in laning phase, and that is to keep the enemy jungler at bay. and taking objectives; I never blame my jungler for not ganking cause at the end of the day, I am the one who put myself outta of the position and got killed for it. You don't have things warded? Then expect ganks from the enemy as they continue to see you overextend. Mid/Top/Bottom lanes aren't as important as the jungler as they are the people who make the plays with the Support to help others out of laning phase. I do agree that you should play like the jungler is not going to bank, cause odds are he probably won't...and thats because there are other lanes that may need a little more help than you. Besides, what is the point in helping a lane that is 0/5 versus another lane that is 1/ 2. Would you rather snowball someone that had a lead at one point or someone who is doing terrible and getting a kill for them is just going to reset there gold value.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RottedApples","date":"2014-11-17T22:34:26.150+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> Don't expect him to come in and feed you, don't expect him to come in and save you. Yes, that's a junglers job, and they SHOULD do that, but don't expect it.\n\nNo it really isn't a junglers job to save you when you are being an idiot in lane. Typically when i jungle i try to farm my jungle and get a few ganks in to keep lanes stable and/or I have a good opportunity. I don't always do things effectively because i am bronze and therefore don't play well but i understand how the game works. And i am NOT going to gank you if you are 0/3 unless I KNOW we can kill the enemy because otherwise it's just a free double kill for him and possibly buffs. It's better for the team if you just play safe when you are 0/3 and let the jungler get other lanes ahead so they can collapse on your lane and shut the guy down","replies":[]}]}
