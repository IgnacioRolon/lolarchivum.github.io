Riot has found that showing games past recent memory is not an effective tool for players to understand their faults, as they just start saying things like \"this wasn't me, I never act this way\".\n\nThe system punishes based on consistency x severity, meaning you can be punished for 1 game of extreme toxicity or many many games of mild toxicity. \n\nSaying 9x is considered a valid report, as you are threatening other's account, which means it is a harassment.  It may be mild, but it still adds to you behavioral history. \n\nSince this punishment happened 30 days ago, I don't know if Riot support will still have the information,  but you can ask them how many games were considered in your punishment. If not, you can at least ask them how many games you were recently validly reported.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"PresBushDid711","date":"2020-01-14T21:26:18.160+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm going to need you to stop with all the moaning and provide that game 1 chat log, whenever you get a chance.","replies":[]},{"poster":"rujitra","date":"2020-01-14T20:35:33.589+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, calling for reports on other players in such a negative, combative way is not appropriate, and your first game log was part of your punishment too.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Julevi","date":"2020-01-14T21:02:08.500+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"To be honest the whole thread should be closed as you, OP, refuse to show us the needed information and can't have a single comment without screaming at other players.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yin Yang Taoist","date":"2020-01-14T20:40:30.786+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ellatiel,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=blEEIP9O,comment-id=,timestamp=2020-01-14T20:26:34.813+0000)\n>\n> https://i.gyazo.com/61f325da1ea31f5909464b2d5e1ff251.png\n> \n> This is so frustrating!
