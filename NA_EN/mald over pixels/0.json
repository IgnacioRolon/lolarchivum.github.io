Can anyone read these logs and tell me anything I did wrong? I got trolled and griefed and explained (calmly and politely) to my team what the issue was... but because they false reported me now I'm punished??? \n{{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}} \n\nGame 1\nIn-Game\nMald Over Pixels: dude\nMald Over Pixels: how can you take my role then grief me\nMald Over Pixels: you took over 5 seconds to react....\nMald Over Pixels: rettaarded peice of shhht you just cost the entire game, that should have been a free kiII\nMald Over Pixels: he walked up with 30% hp\nMald Over Pixels: im affk this rettaard is troIiing\nMald Over Pixels: this yi walks up so greedy with his top laner dead\nMald Over Pixels: and he is not punished for it\nMald Over Pixels: just an fyi yi\nMald Over Pixels: that was a poor play, you didn't have prio and walked up with 40% health, if my top laner wasnt retaarrded (read: this wasn't shht elo) you would have died there for free 100%\nMald Over Pixels: super greedy and just letting you know because plays like that is why ur hardstuck\nMald Over Pixels: because top troIIed\nMald Over Pixels: now I want you to believe me when I say\nMald Over Pixels: I didn't look you up beforeahnd, I just knew from that play that you

need to think more when playing, prob autopilot too much and play too greedy\nMald Over Pixels: I am D2 jg main, I queued top but this retaarrded fkkccer asked for my role\nMald Over Pixels: so I got jg\nMald Over Pixels: I only queue on this account when I am playing for fun, I wanted to play on my main, but I was eating cheesesticks and playing another game so I queued on this account\nMald Over Pixels: if you don't then I understand, in fact I wouldn't be surprised\nMald Over Pixels: it's likely you don't listen to anyone who knows what they are talking about\nMald Over Pixels: otherwise you wouldn't be the same elo for 6 straihgt years\nMald Over Pixels: maybe now is the time to put your ego aside\nMald Over Pixels: but I can only show you the way, I can't force you to follow it\nMald Over Pixels: I mean I am looking at the op.gg right now\nMald Over Pixels: you were gold 4\nMald Over Pixels: that is another thing that op.gg records so your Iies don't really work :/\nMald Over Pixels: and I might add, due to your Iow rank this season, it would appear you had really low MMR or you wouldn't be in such a Iow elo in this new season\nMald Over Pixels: again, don't fight the truth, just listen to what I say and consider it\nMald Over Pixels: what\nMald Over Pixels: see what happens when you give the yi 2 kiIIs when he should have died for free\nMald Over Pixels: gotta

ahead of time\nMald Over Pixels: but no one react\nMald Over Pixels: ok but I don't think you understand\nMald Over Pixels: I live in my world where I am the protagonist\nMald Over Pixels: why would I want to play a game where I do nothing and get carried by someone else\nMald Over Pixels: when I don't actually have any interest in whether I win or Iose\nMald Over Pixels: I don't watch anime\nMald Over Pixels: I am just saying thta obviously there is a bias towards yourself\nMald Over Pixels: I don't need to carry, but I at least need to enable others or do something in some way to make my time worthwhile\nMald Over Pixels: yeah you guys do that\nMald Over Pixels: i have to go to class in 2.5 hours can we speed this up\nMald Over Pixels: Imfao\nMald Over Pixels: I thought we had that double

You are nonstop harassing your teammates, threatening to afk games and on top of that, u keep calling  them \"rettards\"  just like that.
