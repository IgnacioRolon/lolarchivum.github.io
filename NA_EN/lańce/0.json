I will admit that Fnatic did an amazing job at MSI. I will never take that away from them, but that is only a single team in EU. Just like TSM was pretty dominant in NA spring split. It's just one team.\n\nIf one team dominates a region head over heels, then they are not really increasing in skill. The competition lacks. I think we need more International Events like MSI throughout the year so that competition in the West (more than just a single team) can practice against Top Tier teams more.\n\nBack to the question at hand, no TSM will not win worlds, without more competitive teams in NA or more International Experience.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lstrike","date":"2015-06-03T09:49:13.765+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think any NA team will win worlds in the foreseeable future.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PoisonedTea","date":"2015-06-03T03:15:28.144+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This year could be the year.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yandere Carry","date":"2015-06-03T07:24:40.176+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"CLG Worlds S5","replies":[]}]}
