How often do you see anyone (that isn&#039;t Bjergsen) solo killing in lane? Almost never. How often do you see bot lane constantly trying to kill and missing a ton of CS over it? Same answer. \r\nIf the jungler shows up, yeah sure, I&#039;ll hop into that fight. But don&#039;t expect solo kills left and right, that&#039;s not how this game is meant to be played. And while I&#039;m not killing my opposing laner, I&#039;m also not obsessed with killing them like they are with me, so while they&#039;ve missed over 50 CS now they also haven&#039;t gotten a single kill to compensate it. That&#039;s all the advantage you need to win.\r\n\r\ntl;dr Pick smart fights, take smart trades, and you&#039;ll win the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Slamurai Jack","date":"2015-03-29T18:03:22.123+0000","up_votes":25,"down_votes":2,"body":"Obviously, being overly aggressive and picking stupid fights is bad, but being overly passive brings its own set of problems.

The second is that, since they've been playing like a little bitch up to this point, any sudden sign of aggression now immediately gives away that I'm trying to gank. The third reason, is that getting shoved in inevitably wrecks your vision control, while the enemy laner can place wards at his leisure.

That might literally be \"too passive\". I play the lane the way it should be played, I cs, I poke, I take good trades, and I don't let the other team dictate how the lane will be played. But what I don't do is push aimlessly, take every chance at diving them, etc. Don't get me wrong, if they make a mistake I will be the first to punish it, but I won't create a conflict that goes beyond a trade unless there is something larger at work (gank incoming for me, Karth ult, etc). Too often people forget that this isn't cod and we don't have to kill the enemies to take their turrets, then I get to hear about it because \"we don't have any kills\". NEITHER DO THEY! And we're cs'ing better. That's a lead people. /rant lol","replies":[{"poster":"OyddAWqJ5r","date":"2015-03-30T02:43:09.423+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's not passive then.

C9 plays in a way that they don't usually have high kill score games because they get a gold lead laning phase/early and then dominate team fights. That doesn't really work in solo q for obvious reasons. Playing passive in bad lane matchups is usually good, but when you can you want to try and get kills onto the other laner to not only get a gold lead, but to tilt them as well.\n\nLeague of Legends isn't at all a game about killing the other team, you're definitely right there.

I hate it when I get a lane opponent who stands a mile behind their minion line and brings 5 potions to lane after every back since that basically makes it so I can't do anything to them and I might as well be by myself, just with an invincible minion that makes sure I can't push the lane that fast.\n\nPro players play safe because since both teams are so skilled, any screw up can lead to a major advantage. So they don't take risks unless they know they'll win the trade or get the kill, but then it's not really a risk. \n\nTaking chances makes a game fun and exciting. Just because a strategy might make it more likely you'll win doesn't make it the \"way the game is meant to be played\", since it's hardly fun at all, and isn't that what a game is for?","replies":[]},{"poster":"BatteryDead","date":"2015-03-30T13:25:20.966+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love being the passive ADC, I just farm and poke and farm until I get a good opportunity or my support does a good setup. hang in the backline and 420 blaze it poking away while the big tanks bruise it out.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jasiwel","date":"2015-03-30T13:23:53.698+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's also the fact that some champions are better at aggression early (Riven, Zed, Orianna, etc) than others. Like, if I'm playing Karthus or Viktor, my thoughts are \"Stay alive to farm until midgame powerspike.\" If you're expecting either to get kills early without Jungler help, your expectations might be a bit too high. Even then, players are entitled to their own playstyle - as long as your tower is safe and you have decent income, who cares? \n\nThere's a difference between farming and playing defensively. Unless I'm Nasus/Karthus/Veigar, I'm not going to sit on my hands for 10 minutes trying to farm: I'm going to be looking for openings to deal damage, while farming for a stronger midgame. I think a lot of people are really impatient in this game because of how long the typical one lasts. I might just be different, but my favorite games are usually the ones where First Blood isn't given within the first five minutes.

You arent the only one on the team and, it makes jungling twice as hard when you need ganks. Passive players, atleast the ones who play passive 100% of the time are selfish players it seems.
