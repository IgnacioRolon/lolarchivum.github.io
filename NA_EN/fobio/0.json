Moving items drops fps to 1-4, and sometimes it drops when i cast random spells like smite or sth. The whole game just freezes for 2sec but until then its smooth 60fps. I have played on windows 8 on this same laptop and it was just fine. It automatically updated to win10 and i think this is when the problems started. \nAnyone else having similar problems?\nHow to fix it?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-19T16:39:35.321+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's possible that some drivers need to be updated with your OS upgrade, or that the game needs to scan for corrupt game files.

I will try to \"repair\" the game and if that doesnt work I'll try to reinstall or sth. I found that some people had the same problems.

It might be a driver problem in your pc. If you are lucky and havnt removed the windows.old folder then you can restore windows 8 (google it or just ask me if you cant get it to work). I have an old laptop. When it got windows 10 the network card stopped working because of the driver didnt work and windows 10 and no drivers for my network was or will ever be made for windows 10. I rolled it back to windows 7 but after all it is a old laptop so I dont use it and have a gaming msi I use. Warning the windows.old folder will remove itself after some time to save space and many cleaner programs remove it to save space.","replies":[]}]}
