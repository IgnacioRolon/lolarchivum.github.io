I've played league since season 3 and I have dedicated hundreds of hours and money into this game (I'm Platinum 2 and had an MMR of Diamond). As every other player that has received a permaban, I have received many chat restrictions (which I agree with) and an additional 2-week ban (which ended 7 days before this one). I learned from my mistakes the second I realized where the 2-week ban could lead to and I became more friendly. I'm not sure how the league banning system works, for all I know it might have to do with the amount of \"wtfs\" and \"kms\" I type. I once got a 10 game chat restriction for typing \"f**k me im garbage\" like 3 times in a game after a mistake. What I do understand is that these bans are meant for people who are ruining the fun for other players and I think someone should actually read through the chat log instead of letting a bot decide who gets banned. The player in my game (Tristana),  flamed me constantly and my whole team (and most of the enemy team) agreed with me. I am 100% sure she got some sort of penalty but mine made no sense to me at first. Not only did the ban appear 3minutes after the game ended - meaning a bot just checked my \"wtfs\" - but what surprises me the most is how I didnt ruin the fun for anyone apart for the tristana who was clearly not having fun in the first place. She was extremely toxic while I just replied to her comments and ignored her most of the time. I was even typing with the enemy team and having fun, regardless of the fact that I was auto filled into the only lane I don't enjoy.\r\n\r\nAfter the ban was issued I received a message saying that an email would be sent to me with the full details of the report and it was not sent.\r\n\r\nHere is the chat log for the final game that decided my final report. I just don't think I deserved this one (in brackets ill explain what was going on):\r\nGame 1 {{champion:163}} \r\nSnEpeX: did u guys just not type in the lobby? (i got filled and asked for someone to swap lane with me and no one replied)\r\nSnEpeX: i got kinda ignored\r\nSnEpeX: lel\r\nSnEpeX: gl guys (team got a kill)\r\nSnEpeX: trist... come on\r\nSnEpeX: ?\r\nSnEpeX: lol\r\nSnEpeX: ahahahaha\r\nSnEpeX: stfu (tristana blamed me for our first deaths)\r\nSnEpeX: before u go crazy mode learn ur limits as adc lel\r\nSnEpeX: ive never played sup this season\r\nSnEpeX: lane swap? (tristana leaves lane to take farm and annoy our mid laner)\r\nSnEpeX: wtf\r\nSnEpeX: trist suicides on u and flames me (tristana msges the enemy team asking to report me for feeding)\r\nSnEpeX: xD\r\nSnEpeX: i got filled \r\nSnEpeX: lol\r\nSnEpeX: not how it works idiot (she says that if i got filled i should have dodged)\r\nSnEpeX: not troll pick tho (she keeps typing about how Taliyah support is a troll pick, while the enemy team and my team agrees that its not)\r\nSnEpeX: its not troll pick\r\nSnEpeX: wtf\r\nSnEpeX: it was working as poke\r\nSnEpeX: trist just suicides on u\r\nSnEpeX: ah ok\r\nSnEpeX: my bad (i messed up on a play)\r\nSnEpeX: xD\r\nSnEpeX: my wall tho (saved my team)\r\nSnEpeX: report trist for flame plz\r\nSnEpeX: so toxic\r\nSnEpeX: trist ur garbage (she asked them to report me for feeding while she was 1/5 and i was 0/3)\r\nSnEpeX: 59 (her creep score when their adc had 100)\r\nSnEpeX: dude\r\nSnEpeX: gj ziggs (double kill for ziggs)\r\nSnEpeX: clear as the sky (our riven says she is having i hard time with irelia and i agree with her and go help)\r\nSnEpeX: rip\r\nSnEpeX: irelia2fed4me\r\nSnEpeX: flash for the 0/6 taliyah (typed to the enemy team)\r\nSnEpeX: lol\r\nSnEpeX: i didnt cry (trist again asks to report me for feeding and then crying all game)\r\nSnEpeX: u flamed me\r\nSnEpeX: and i complained\r\nSnEpeX: what?\r\nSnEpeX: good wall wtf\r\nSnEpeX: xD\r\nSnEpeX: lethality not broken at all rn\r\nSnEpeX: we have other teamates\r\nSnEpeX: trist so toxic (then I just start asking to report her, repetitively)\r\nSnEpeX: l2p\r\nSnEpeX: reported\r\nSnEpeX: xD\r\nSnEpeX: AHAHAHAH (I got one shot by their jhin and I laugh with others)\r\nSnEpeX: SO BALANCED\r\nSnEpeX: 1K DMG\r\nSnEpeX: exactly 1k\r\nSnEpeX: gg wp\r\nSnEpeX: report trist for flame plz\r\nSnEpeX: drake?\r\nSnEpeX: lol..... \r\nSnEpeX: xD\r\nSnEpeX: everyone on our team is complaining about her\r\nSnEpeX: she flames me back \r\nSnEpeX: gg\r\nSnEpeX: gg report trist\r\nSnEpeX: not rly\r\nSnEpeX: see u actualy have an adc\r\nSnEpeX: nice\r\nSnEpeX: ;3 ziggs\r\nSnEpeX: WE GOT IT IDIOT (trist keeps asking for reports and how im \"trolling\")\r\nSnEpeX: xD\r\nSnEpeX: stfu trist\r\nSnEpeX: i couldnt move (perma stunned and died)\r\nSnEpeX: gg wp\r\n\r\nI'm not expecting much honestly, just want others to read through the log and see if they agree with me. I don't exactly flame my teammates for being playing badly, I get angry at them for unnecessarily blaming certain mistakes on me or my teammates and then acting as if they're pros.\r\nPersonally, I don't think I should have been banned. Got placed in a lane I'm not comfortable in and got flamed at for not playing perfectly.\r\nI'd love to keep playing the game and get a fresh start, but taking from me permanently all the time and effort that it took to unlock every single champion, rank'up, have extra 26k IP and all the hundreds of euros that I have wasted on skins, bundles, icons, wards, chests, skin boosts, and rune pages frustrates me.\r\nBest regards,\r\nSnEpeX","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-23T20:21:11.746+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It doesn't look like you were the most toxic person in the world with your chat, but it wasn't exactly beneficial or in the spirit of teamwork either. Some of the things that were said could have been viewed as a personal attack I suppose, like \"trist ur garbage\". In the long run, it sounds like the some people in that game might have reported you if you saw a notification shortly after the match. Reach out to us in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and we can go over all the context for why that punishment was placed.","replies":[]}]}
