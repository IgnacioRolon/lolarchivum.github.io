While he doesnt have an I kill you now button he is more adaptable then most assassins and isnt 1 directional like others so less predicable as he can assist the team better in team fights with Proper W placements, peel, or even assist in retreats.","replies":[{"poster":"I Spread Cancer","date":"2018-11-09T19:52:09.173+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=LeftyRaydy,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=pxRfxFlq,comment-id=0000000000010001000000000000,timestamp=2018-11-09T19:05:42.641+0000)\n>\n> if he was so easy everyone would play him and he would have a high WR but he doesnt.\n\nDo you really think it work like that? Annie is one of the most beginner champion but it doesn't change the fact she's trash, just like ekko, a trash champion with braindead kit.

The reason they gave a strong braindead item like dusk is because most ad assassins have alot more counterplay than ap assassins (not all just most) for example while most ap assassins can pop enemies extremely quickly they also dont have much outplay potential which makes them viable whether they are braindead or not, while ad assassins have alot more outplay potential (whether its because their burst isnt as fast because they can aa for dmg or because their burst is extremely telegraphed)\n\nZed without dusk is relatively weak because his ult is countered by stopwatch or hourglass and without dusk he doesnt quite have the dmg to pop people in one combo\n\nTalon without dusk isnt able to pop people and his burst is at some points easily telegraphed\n\nThe rest i assume you can figure out on your own.\n\nMy point is that there is too much outplay potential in champs now, so in order to make assassins viable they need to give them the ability to assassinate.\nI dont think ad assassins are a problem right now, if anything its ap assassins that need a nerf. If you look at the most played champs from plat+ the first assassin that appears is Ahri at number 23 and there are 4 more ap assassins after until the first ad assassin which is zed at 43. \n\nI do wish there was a way for them to fix the braindead part about assassins because i honestly loved assassins being skillful to play.

Ahri is probably the easiest and the safest assassin out of all of them. Nidalee while hard can Wait until she lands a spear or someone steps on a trap, then guess what GG easy she goes in and assassinates with super high damage. Katarina can get good bounces then all she has to do is face roll the keyboard (however a skilled katarina will know how to do this more often). Akali is another one where it is hard to assassinate, but at the same time she has sustain and the most overloaded ability in the game with her shroud.
