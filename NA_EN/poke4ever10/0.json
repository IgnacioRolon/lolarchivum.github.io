It never was like this for the last few months. I can connect to games and champion select like usual, but whenever I finish a game, the client shows the L loading image for a good long while... I can even hear the chat box and people entering/leaving, but it takes about 20 seconds for it to show anything, and I always miss the after game chat :/\n\nI've defragmented, used ccleaner to clear my junk files, upgraded my drivers, uninstalled a bunch of junkware, and even close unnecessary programs in my system tray and task manager. Is there a setting that I need to change or is it just the client being buggy? I would say it could be my CPU but it's worked before and with other things.\n\nAny help would be appreciated :3","replies":[{"poster":"Skillzone","date":"2017-03-02T19:37:37.999+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same thing happens with me!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-03-02T02:44:45.190+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like this is happening in the Beta Client.
