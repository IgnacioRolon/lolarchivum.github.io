There's a devil in the details, however -- AE hard CC is a very powerful effect, and it's important whoever's inflicting it can appreciate when it happens. With nearby JitBs, Shaco generates hard CC off of himself, but its more appreciable -- enemies draw closer to the boxes little by little and there's a clear line when it'll be triggered. Far away JitBs do have some issues here, of course. \n\nWhen the CC is attached to clone detonate, it's a lot muddier. We found in testing that while it's easy to see when the clone dies, it's pretty tough to track when the clone _will_ die -- enemies can swap focus off of it when they figure out it's fake, Shaco can get distracted by someone finding his real self, etc. That often resulted in opponents seeing the cool ae CC detonate play and Shaco himself being barely aware it had happened. \n\nThe box triangle is a direct evolution from that -- the detonate sets up the JitBs, the JitBs themselves are always clear to Shaco in what they're doing. It's not as immediately impactful as a CC detonate, but it allows Shaco a place of safety to retreat to and ended up creating more consistently interesting plays. It's also got some minor teaching value for novice Shacos -- box triangle was strong well before it was a meme xD","replies":[{"poster":"HollowMimic","date":"2016-10-28T20:39:19.632+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for your answer Faux.\n\n**However, wouldn't that issue (not realising when the gas landed) just add to the skill gap for someone playing Shaco?**\n\nSince there is so much diversity among champions, people discover what playstyle fits them most or try to adjust their playstyle to the champion they like. Thus, learning a hard but unique champion might be what someone wishes to do. And with so many champions in the game, it's not like a player will just give up if he gets frustrated from not managing to play with Shaco. He/she will either give up on him or practice harder.\n\nAll in all, it doesn't matter how hard it is to learn a champion but how rewarding is when you do (I've learned that from one-trick-ponies with high skill champions). But (only from what I've seen) the new Shaco doesn't seem rewarding enough for his already high-skill gap.\n\nAs for the practical point, I wouldn't call the triangle a place of safety since the boxes last for so little and all of them die when one  of them gets destroyed. At least with the gas, the person would be (sort of) paralyzed and Shaco had more time to escape. Of course all of this is theoretical. Maybe there's sth that we all miss because we haven't played with him yet. Whatever the case is, I wish for a satisfying result for the whole rework, when it goes live.\n\n\nPS. Also, what ShadeW said. Pinkward has a nice video about it (not a rant); maybe you can gather some info from it.","replies":[{"poster":"20thCenturyFaux","date":"2016-10-28T21:12:45.529+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":2,"body":"The skill gap would grow, to be sure, but it's much harder to grow mastery on a character when the game's not giving you good feedback on when your ult was working well or not. Further, being able to make good use of the box triangle's power has its own brand of mastery -- if players really struggle to make good use of it we'd of course revisit, and so far many players do seem to be able to use it well, which makes sense because it does a lot of damage and can deny quite a large area -- if it dies in a chokepoint it'll get some work done. \n\nThere was a bug on PBE for a bit where if someone attacked one of the mini-boxes with a very small amount of damage at a certain level range it would one-shot all three, so that may well have been contributing to perceptions they die instantly? If the R boxes need more HP or duration they'll get it, they can be tuned individually.\n\nThat's rather the point of Shaco's mini-rework -- adding the tools we need to be able to tune the character properly. At this point, we have levers we can use to adjust either his burst or dps at any phase of the game. It'll make balancing him much easier. \n\nPinkward's video was certainly interesting, and his main concerns were with power level; generally speaking, most folks who are worried seem to be worried about power level. Naturally so are we, and while Shaco mains probably won't worry about the potential world where he releases too strong, that is a very real possibility too -- the preseason is going to do all sorts of spicy disruption to the game, and balance will certainly be a stranger place for the first patches afterward.","replies":[{"poster":"Hyrum Graff","date":"2016-10-28T21:52:22.691+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"+1 to OP's response, you did a damn good job providing context in this thread.","replies":[{"poster":"HollowMimic","date":"2016-10-28T21:58:41.401+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you buddy.\n\nJust tried to cover most concerns through constructive conversation.\n\n(plz dont ask my age :P)","replies":[{"poster":"20thCenturyFaux","date":"2016-10-28T23:32:15.971+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=HollowMimic,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ietEMFIk,comment-id=000000000002000100010000,timestamp=2016-10-28T21:58:41.401+0000)\n>\n> Thank you buddy.\n> \n> Just tried to cover most concerns through constructive conversation.\n> \n> (plz dont ask my age :P)\n\nYour efforts are super appreciated here, too -- if players are concerned, usually it's something we're also concerned about, and threads like this are a great opportunity to share what we've got","replies":[{"poster":"HollowMimic","date":"2016-10-28T23:49:03.553+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You know sth folks,\n\nI've been posting for almost 2 yrs in HS forums (using the same tone), trying to help improving the game and not once I felt that I was achieving anything.\nAnd now here I am, 5 months after I started this game, I made my first suggestion and it immediately turned into a helpful and constructive conversation for both sides (seller + customer).\n\nI guess, Blizzard needs an operations and strategy consultant :D (apologies but I had to get that out) (hoping to not get banned for this comment :P)","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"HollowMimic","date":"2016-10-28T21:41:22.347+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Completely satisfied.\n\nWe now just have to wait and see and hope for the best.\n\nThank you once again.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ff4sk","date":"2016-10-28T20:46:33.381+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"Not to sound like I'm flaming you or anything but the whole box thing seems stupid and feels like just a gimmick to use as a reason to nerf shaco further.\n\nshaco didn't need gimmicks, he was already a tricky champion to master, what we wanted was a buff to his late game and some toning to his early so he can be healthy early and stay viable late game.\n\nInstead we got nerfs to his damage across the board on all his abilities making his early insanely harsh and his scaling is so weak that he's now weaker late game on pbe than he is on live servers.\n\nShaco is currently so versatile with tons of possible builds you can go, pbe shaco looks like a cruel attempt to cripple all of shaco's different play styles to force him into an AP role.\n\nI understand that his early may have been slightly oppressive but seriously these nerfs are just brutal.\nI don't even know if he can be played anything besides AP anymore.","replies":[{"poster":"20thCenturyFaux","date":"2016-10-28T20:57:03.972+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":5,"body":"If he releases too weak, we'll be able to buff him.

I'm pretty sure I get stunned each time he ults me (unless it only happens if I hit a wall).","replies":[{"poster":"DrugsForRobots","date":"2016-10-29T03:10:49.739+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Xin's R knocks back anyone and everyone around him other than his 'challenged' target. The knockback does take ~.5s. He also has his W that causes his 3rd attack to knock you up briefly.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Bardful","date":"2016-10-28T21:19:53.071+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1) The changes to his ult still have him shoot blades which I like because it makes him appear closer to jhin which could be a really cool direction for the lore so I wouldn't want it to change. \n\n2) They could just make the boxes invulnerable until they fear surrounding targets.\n\n3) With the double box stacking dash interrupts no loner existing, I feel a good support change that would fit thematically goes like this. When his boxes fear someone, surrounding allies laugh and gain (10% of shaco's ad) and (10% of shaco's ap) for 1.5/2.5/3.5 seconds. A different scaling could be an option but the part to note would be surrounding allies gain something and laugh.","replies":[{"poster":"Bardful","date":"2016-10-28T21:22:08.807+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Really my only issue with your proposal is point 1. Someone made a post where they suggested jhin and shaco have some relation in lore and it makes so much sense. They wear masks, are psychotic, and jhin's e is similar to shaco's ult. Besides shaco's lore needs an update so this would be even better.","replies":[]}]}]}
