What is their backstory? Champions repeatedly kill them for gold and experience. But are they simply just empty beings?\r\n\r\n**Character background options**\r\n_Different options/opportunities to drive lore and character dev. at the same time_\r\n\r\n1. Minions are created by the League every match and are usually empty husks with a few simple commands attached. One minion ends up becoming self aware. Essentially a Terminator-esk story line where instead of rise of the machines, it's rise of a single minion.\r\n2. Prisoners or any enemies of the League are either changed into or imprisoned in the body of the minions. For some reason the process isn't done right or the person in particular is strong. The reason isn't important. What is important is that there's a minion that goes missing and starts amassing power. Eventually it's found and becomes a champion.\r\n\r\n**Powers and abilities**\r\nHere's where I kind of suck, but as the backstory of the champion is essentially a minion that has risen up above its own destiny/fate. The abilities need to be somewhat related.\r\n\r\nPotential Passive/Ability Ideas\r\n\r\n1. Creating Minions - Something along the lines of the number of spells or autos, it alternates between creating caster or melee minion. As the level increases, the damage or number of minions increase. To mitigate how OP this could be, you'd have to have some type of timer where the minions essentially die out. \r\n2. Changing minions - Changing existing lane minions from caster to melee or vice versa\r\n3. Converting minions - I'm guessing this would have to be a passive, but it'd be similar to Ivern passive with jungle.... but minions.\r\n\r\nHigher level gameplay/ability ideas\r\nAlmost all players are aware of the four main types of minions caster, melee, cannon, and super (no dominion minion go away). So why shouldn't the abilities of the champion be similar to mirror the different style?\r\n\r\n* Similar to how Jayce can switch between auto and melee, I envision this champion to do something similar. However, this would be an ability that you spend mana to switch, **UNLESS** a minion of the other type is around. i.e._ you're in melee mode, you use the ability near a caster minion and switch to ranged._\r\n* Lastly an ult that empowers you to do more damage/increases range. If caster you become champ version of a cannon minion, If melee you become a champ version of a super minion.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease give me feedback. Tell me what you think. If portions suck, please tell me. If portions are great and should be expanded on, please tell me. If anyone else has any lore on minions that I definitely missed, leave a comment. I love when champ backgrounds give us more insight into the lore behind the game and this is a way for me to try and push for more minion sized lore.","replies":[{"poster":"BlackKnightJack","date":"2019-08-28T05:25:30.030+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The original story was that they were creatures low-level summoners created that had no will of their own.
