It attempted reconnecting for the full duration of character select, then the Unknown Error notification came up.\r\n\r\nClosed client, rebooted. I click the reconnect button to try and get into my match, it greys out and the Unknown Error pops up again. Are we experiencing client issues, or something? I'm sure my teammates don't appreciate the fact their support seemingly abandoned them when I've been making every attempt to get back into the game. :C","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-22T17:14:11.158+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your network seems to be having problems and can't establish comms with the game server.
