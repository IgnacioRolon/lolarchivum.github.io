That's basically what this rune is.

The decay arguably doesn't belong on a short duration, but it is definitely going to be more considered on a wide variety of champions than ultimate hat was which was HARDLY picked up if you secondary down sorcery. Olaf, Singed, Skarner, Mundo, and other speedy fighters (I guess thats what we can call Singed here but he is honestly in a genre of his own) would all much rather have this since it makes their ultimates much more potent. Singed Ult+Nimbus makes it a lot easier to get in fling range. Throw in Shureliya's and you aren't getting away. Olaf can close a bit more distance at the start of his ult to get you in an axe chain. As stated below, Skarner can drag you a bit further which could lead to kills he otherwise wouldn't have gotten.\n\nThis rune is at least a bigger competition for sorcery secondary than ultimate hat was on a majority of champions (since ultimate hat wasn't very good to begin with due to the nature of its stacking and how it works with CDR) and is at least something to CONSIDER on junglers besides the default celerity+waterwalking (will probably take the place of waterwalking since Celerity not only synergizes with it but is VERY good on its own).","replies":[{"poster":"PB4UAME","date":"2018-05-10T03:13:21.270+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"None of that seems to me to be a justification for removing a heavily used mage rune in the mage rune page, to \"compensate\" it by buffing bruisers and assassins who only splash the tree as a secondary, and are directly in competition with mages, so its nerfing mages and buffing their counters, in the mage's own rune page.  Like seriously, what the actual fuck?   This just after massive mage nerfs to itemization and to their base stats, and is paired also with huge buffs to assassins, ADCs and their itemization. Totally seems fair, right?\n\nAnd I say this as a juggernaut and tank player who would actually benefit from the changes.
