Even a custom training game, I am only able to get to champ select, and when it tries to load the game it all crashes and says I can't connect. I checked the servers for Riot, they're all fine from what I can see. I checked my own internet connection, it's fine from what I can see. So I know that I should be able to connect, but it's like something it blocking me. The reason I think this is a hack onto my account personally is because recently myself and a few friends joined an esports tournament. When we faced one team in particular the problem first started where I could not connect into the champion loading screen. I closed and reopened the client, only to find that my password was no longer working. I typed in my username and password very slowly, making sure to hit the exact keys, and nothing changed. I kept receiving the error that one of them was wrong. So I went to reset my password, which I ended up doing three separate times. Each time nothing happened, and I could still not log into the game. After around fifteen minutes of trying to reconnect, I was able to. Yet it still had me wondering if It affected any of my other accounts. So while I was still not able to log into my main account, I went to log into one of my other accounts and guess what I COULD! Later after the games were done, we found out that other teams who had faced the team we just faced were experiencing the same problems. Where one or tow people were not able to log in, even after numerous password resets. Now today I log back into my account, and when I go to play a game, I have the exact same problem. I can't get into the champion loading screen. I can log in, but I can't get into the loading screen. I checked for this on my other accounts, and it's affecting them too. So now I am in a state where I am unable to play a game.\"\r\n\r\nThis is a copy paste from a support ticket that I submitted, but a friend told me to also look for help here. Original ticket here: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/30387825\r\n\r\nTL;DR. I believe my account got hacked. I could not log in, kept receiving wrong username/password error. Tried to reset password numerous times but didn't help. Found out later that other people experienced the same issues against the school we were facing. We have them under suspicion of hacking.\r\n\r\nThe tournament can be found here: https://battlefy.com/chicago-high-school-esports/chicago-high-school-esports-2017-lol/5833212c1c73653f03898e79/info?infoTab=details\r\n\r\nThe school that is being currently suspected of hacking is Taft, so that will help with summoner names. \r\n\r\nNot really sure what else to put here, so I hope this all helps.\r\n\r\nhttps://media.tenor.co/images/49def257346261c59df1aa430e1b57c1/tenor.gif","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-23T02:15:55.158+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We've been having some weird login issues lately and we're currently on the ball getting those fixed up.
