He is not someone that loses a lot of the time, but is simply beat up for stating his opinions... *cough* and that Heimerdinger is the worst yordle and that is actual fact *cough*... We have yet to actually see an interaction between Rumble and Trist, or Teemo and Trist in something that's not fan made, so stating what he is based on pure fan fiction shows that you don't know what you are talking about. Plus, Teemo is actually quite nice, not an ass hole. Learn your lore dude.","replies":[]}]}]}
