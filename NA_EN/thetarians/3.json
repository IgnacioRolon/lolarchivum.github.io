I will select one random person that commented on this post. And they will receive the skin of their choice.\n\nBUT, if I win. Well then... Nothing really happens since I can&#039;t make you guys give me a skin.\n\nEDIT: Due to new information about the champ schedule, I am now making the bet as to ONLY a new Yordle.","replies":[{"poster":"hoes and bows","date":"2016-07-08T23:34:17.092+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have a theory \nhttps://i.imgflip.com/174amw.jpg","replies":[]},{"poster":"D3m37r1","date":"2016-07-09T15:16:23.775+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's either void related,insect related or the legendary mandrake ward the was supposedly iceboxed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mad King Hades","date":"2016-07-09T15:15:29.166+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm going to say that they are creating a new Garen skin.

That post was several years  back, and I think the tech has come quite a ways now. So I think this teaser is for that champ. The short of it is, it is a hive mind of bug like things that morph their form, with the potential idea to bind to other champs as shielding or something of that sort. My belief that this is the champ is because of the sinister noises in the brush and the cacophony of weird clicks and noises and cries that whatever it is makes, implying that it's not human and possibly not even animal. \n\nLink to the Jeremy vid here:\nhttps://youtu.be/lDq3lCCjoOE","replies":[]},{"poster":"Skelenth","date":"2016-07-08T23:15:16.697+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Totally-not-mandatory-comment-in-order-to-get-the-chance-to-a-free-skin-even-though-my-account-is-on-EUW","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kitty Darkstar","date":"2016-07-08T22:53:23.361+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Greed was the enemy!","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Aqualious","date":"2016-07-08T22:26:00.745+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll gift you a skin maybe, if I have the RP\n\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"macromite","date":"2016-07-08T22:24:23.322+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"pretty sure it's a pterodactyl","replies":[]},{"poster":"KitsuneKrash","date":"2016-07-08T22:22:28.309+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While I would love another yordle, especially on designed for jungle, the sounds seem closer to a void creature or some kind of bird.
