I am not familiar with which organizations are affiliated with League of Legends to host Collegiate e-Sports. I have heard about NCeSPA and I was wondering whether your company is connected? If so how do i proceed? I know that their are other e-Sports categories such as CS:GO and Dota, and I wish to involve those games in the club to create a broader scope! If League is separate or affiliated with another organization I would love guidance to where I should go.
