Even if you have Merc&#039;s Treads, her Q still lasts about 2.1 seconds (if my math is correct).

Is also bought only late game most of the time, and in this current meta, there is no late game.\r\n\r\nSure, you could use Legend: Tenacity in the precision tree, but that usually isn&#039;t worth it for most champions as they would rather go into Alacrity or even Bloodline.\r\n\r\nI think we could either add new items in the game that give tenacity, or we could trade some stats that current items have for tenacity. For example, remove 10% CDR on {{item:3078}}  for 10% or 20% tenacity. Or remove Haste (Unique Passive - Item gains additional 10% CDR) from {{item:3285}} {{item:3030}} {{item:3003}}  for 10% or 20% tenacity.\r\n\r\nBasically, each role should be allowed to purchase some kind of tenacity item rather than just bruisers. Could make it a new Unique Passive named &quot;Unstoppable (btw)&quot; or something so that people can&#039;t just stack tenacity items.","replies":[{"poster":"Warlord Rhinark","date":"2018-07-30T13:34:32.067+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{item:3170}}","replies":[{"poster":"PerfectPower","date":"2018-07-30T13:55:08.737+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Warlord Rhinark","date":"2018-07-30T13:57:57.029+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=PerfectPower,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=A6ztlXk0,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2018-07-30T13:55:08.737+0000)\n>\n> That can&#x27;t be used on SR lmao.\n\nI am fully aware of that.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Gosh Darn","date":"2018-07-30T17:33:23.623+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Warlord Rhinark,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=A6ztlXk0,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2018-07-30T13:34:32.067+0000)\n>\n> {{item:3170}}\n\nDefinitely needs to be added to Summoner's Rift.
