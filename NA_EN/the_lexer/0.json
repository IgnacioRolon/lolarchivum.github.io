I've sadly played Dominion even less so ever since I actually tried playing Ranked.\n\nHowever, if Ranked Dominion became a thing as well or Dominion got more support so that it didn't feel secondary game mode next to traditional, I could definitely see myself playing more Dominion again. It's a lot more fun and interesting than the typical 'destroy enemy turrets, kill enemy nexus' setup.\n\nAny chance we might see more from Dominion in the future at all somehow? {{summoner:17}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sweet","date":"2014-07-16T20:48:28.827+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally, I play ARAMs and SR most often and URF was definitely one of my favorite modes.
