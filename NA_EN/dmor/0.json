So I just recently ran into an issue where in my household if anyone is streaming anything in one of our rooms, it causes my ping to be very unstable (see below). This only occurs when someone is on our wifi connection and watching Netflix/Sling/Hulu etc. Also, I must add that this has not been an issue until recently and I haven't found any fixes. I ran a speedtest too and we are getting ~15mb/s download / ~1mb/s upload speed, if that makes any correlation.\r\n\r\n_pasted log from pinging the League of Legends NA Server:_\r\nReply from 104.160.131.3: bytes=32 time=39ms TTL=54\r\nReply from 104.160.131.3: bytes=32 time=39ms TTL=54\r\nReply from 104.160.131.3: bytes=32 time=38ms TTL=54\r\nReply from 104.160.131.3: bytes=32 time=134ms TTL=54\r\nReply from 104.160.131.3: bytes=32 time=40ms TTL=54\r\nReply from 104.160.131.3: bytes=32 time=39ms TTL=54\r\nReply from 104.160.131.3: bytes=32 time=39ms TTL=54\r\nReply from 104.160.131.3: bytes=32 time=69ms TTL=54\r\nReply from 104.160.131.3: bytes=32 time=39ms TTL=54\r\nReply from 104.160.131.3: bytes=32 time=39ms TTL=54\r\nReply from 104.160.131.3: bytes=32 time=39ms TTL=54\r\nReply from 104.160.131.3: bytes=32 time=116ms TTL=54\r\nReply from 104.160.131.3: bytes=32 time=39ms TTL=54\r\nReply from 104.160.131.3: bytes=32 time=39ms TTL=54\r\nReply from 104.160.131.3: bytes=32 time=39ms TTL=54\r\nReply from 104.160.131.3: bytes=32 time=250ms TTL=54\r\nReply from 104.160.131.3: bytes=32 time=39ms TTL=54\r\nReply from 104.160.131.3: bytes=32 time=38ms TTL=54\r\nReply from 104.160.131.3: bytes=32 time=39ms TTL=54\r\nReply from 104.160.131.3: bytes=32 time=260ms TTL=54\r\nReply from 104.160.131.3: bytes=32 time=38ms TTL=54\r\nReply from 104.160.131.3: bytes=32 time=38ms TTL=54\r\nReply from 104.160.131.3: bytes=32 time=39ms TTL=54\r\nReply from 104.160.131.3: bytes=32 time=357ms TTL=54\r\nReply from 104.160.131.3: bytes=32 time=39ms TTL=54\r\nReply from 104.160.131.3: bytes=32 time=38ms TTL=54\r\nReply from 104.160.131.3: bytes=32 time=39ms TTL=54\r\nReply from 104.160.131.3: bytes=32 time=39ms TTL=54\r\nReply from 104.160.131.3: bytes=32 time=39ms TTL=54","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2018-01-09T21:09:44.748+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It looks like you're having some hiccups, like the 260, but it's not telling where it's coming from exactly.
