I have tried lowering my settings, restarting my computer, exiting and reconnecting as well as check and tune my computer however none of these things have helped. To me it seems to be an issue with the client since during these drops if I look at my task manager I see that league is taking a large amount of my cpu and disk space (larger than it would normally take up). The issue has been occurring since the issue of the connection error bug that has popped up and  seems to occur when the connection error message popped up or after that fact. Other than the past few days I have never had this issue.\n\nI would also like to note that while the fps drop is occurring my computer may even freeze and will emit a loud buzzing noise for a large or small period of time. If I look at my task manager I would see a large cpu usage while this occurs.\n\nI would also like to note that nothing else is running in the background while I play.\n\nIf anyone could help me with this problem I would greatly appreciate it.\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"God is a Poro","date":"2016-12-12T11:15:57.526+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you guys tried all the fixes they have also?

If you're running Windows 10, this bar seems to be re-enabled with certain batches of Windows updates and can cause you issues. There's a specific feature inside the Game bar called *Game DVR*. This feature has caused FPS issues, that annoying buzzing sounds during freezes, and general in-game instability. [**This guide**](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html) can help you quickly disable this feature so we can confirm if this was the culprit.\n\nLet me know if this fixed it!","replies":[{"poster":"K0SMOS","date":"2016-12-13T21:35:48.450+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have tried turning off the game dvr however nothing has changed and I am now seeing it take effect outside of league with my screen periodically freezing then returning to normal.

I am not sure what is causing the freezing and I am trying to find something to lead me to a clear answer and right now I know it is not LOL.\n\nI have seen high cpu and disk usage when the issue has occurred so I'm not sure if that may be the issue or how to solve it.\n\nIf you or anyone else can help me I would be very grateful other wise I'm planning to get it checked out.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-13T23:09:39.464+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since you're seeing this outside of League, there are likely hardware or software issues with your computer, and I'd **strongly recommend** having it looked at by a professional.\n\nLet me know what ended up causing this issue.","replies":[{"poster":"K0SMOS","date":"2016-12-14T04:10:10.400+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do have plans to get it checked tommorrow.
