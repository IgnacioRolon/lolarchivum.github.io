Knowing when and where to shadow take some practice but at the same time is not something you can't achieve on 10-15 games of practice. \n\nNid is a bit easier, as long as you can hit a spear or bait your opponent into a trap you are fine since your combo is unstoppable since there is not going out of range.","replies":[{"poster":"Thefriendlyorc","date":"2015-03-02T18:51:58.291+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I did play zed for a while when Yasuo was king, it wasnt hard, at all.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nahui","date":"2015-03-02T15:02:55.658+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Seems someone has never played Zed before.","replies":[{"poster":"Thefriendlyorc","date":"2015-03-02T18:55:46.620+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have a bunch actually.

These three champions have the potential to outplay almost any situation with their high mobility and damage. While i've never been one to put much stock in cries of op i do believe these champs are strong. However the real problem starts in two situations.\n1: Lack of counterplay\n2: Too much cramped into one champion.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CheckMyDoubles","date":"2015-03-02T18:54:45.200+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=scrimbul,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=tutiA1BT,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-03-02T05:57:33.250+0000)\n>\n> I had to remind them that the mobility creep memo said the Nidalee, Riven, Zed and Kalista were all being played by noskill fkwit retards and that their flaming each other was meaningless because none of them had any skill to start with given the current meta.\n> \n> I was reported. :(\n\nAnd you thought your comeback was clever enough to come here and share?
