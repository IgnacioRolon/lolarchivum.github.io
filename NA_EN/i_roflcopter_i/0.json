It doesn't even have to be a good ult by any other measure; as long as Corki is in the Death Realm when The Package spawns, it'll be a worthwhile ult. It's not a bug, but I bet it's an oversight, and I wouldn't be surprised if it got changed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MalignMetal","date":"2019-07-07T18:10:15.915+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh sorry about that  its probably in the death realm.
