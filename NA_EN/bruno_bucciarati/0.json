Whenever selecting the \"borderless\" option on the mac client it doesn't fully cover the screen and leaves edges around of my other open applications. Wondering if there are any plans for this to be fixed or not as playing in fullscreen is extremely annoying because alt tabbing takes like 15 seconds and it's just really unpleasant. Here's an image of the problem: [http://imgur.com/a/e6FOS](http://imgur.com/a/e6FOS)\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you in advance!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-22T03:46:57.398+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You may need to adjust your resolution settings to make sure that League is running at the same res that your desktop is set to. Double check those for me, and let me know if making sure they match is able to help.","replies":[{"poster":"Praise2LordHelix","date":"2017-08-24T06:30:28.622+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not the OP, but same issue. The problem with that for me is that I'm running League on a Macbook Pro. Not a whole lot of GPU power, so if I run League at a resolution where borderless doesn't show the desktop, my overall fps is fairly low and inconsistent. \n\nIs it possible to provide the native fullscreen Mac setting for League? The current settings for League all cover over the current desktop. But every other game I played creates its own fullscreen space separate from the main desktop space (where you can 3 finger swipe to and from. The fake-fullscreen that League has now has that fade-out delay, where the native MacOS fullscreen is pretty flawless.
