It's hard for him to keep his Ferocity up without committing to a fight completely and then using Empowered W is still not something he wants.\n\nHis damage is a bit on the higher side, that empowered Q could lose like 40 base damage and would still be good.  But other than that he still has the same problems: Useless if you anticipate him. He gets blown up and now he doesn't even have stealth from which he can kill you.

Now, tanks can actually position themselves between rengar and their squishies like some makeshift \"get down mister president\" body guard who either is the one targeted instead or he has to walk by you, giving you vision of himself (since his ult is just camouflage) and thus an opportunity to more directly stop him.
