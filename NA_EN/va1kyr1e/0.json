Oh and its running Windows 10 Pro 32-Bit) and I just downloaded LoL. It gets me to the launcher, and it asks me if I want to upgrade to the new client in beta. I hit yes, and the pop-up went away. The Launch button then appeared.  Doesn't work. The launcher does close itself, but the client never launches. I confirmed via task manager. There is nothing, not even a background process. When I try to repair it, it just ... doesn't. I'll click yes on the repair confirmation pop-up and it does nothing.  I have absolutely no idea on what to do. \r\n            I have tried the fix via running compatibility troubleshooter to no avail. I would mess around with the RAD files but everything I've found is at least a year old and I don't want to break LoL even more.","replies":[{"poster":"Va1kyr1e","date":"2017-01-07T12:54:16.350+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright, so I can log in in the legacy client. For some reason when I wanted to use the new beta one it never commenced a download before letting me launch the client.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-05T23:51:02.518+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your installation to the updated client may not have completed properly, and became corrupt.  You may need to perform a [reinstall ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202539040-Reinstalling-League-of-Legends) back to the legacy client.  Double check and make sure that you're able to login all the way through in the legacy client.  Let me know if you run into issues, otherwise you should be able to proceed reinstalling the updated client again.  I hope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"Va1kyr1e","date":"2017-01-06T00:39:31.271+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, I'll come back later tonight.
