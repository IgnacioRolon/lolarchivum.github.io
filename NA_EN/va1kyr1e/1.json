It's pretty low tech, an AMD Athelon (2 cores I think), 2 GB RAM, and a GeForce 8600GTS. Needless to say I was expecting the worse. Then, the game ran for 120 FPS, I was pretty happy and pleasantly surprised. So once, I figured I'd try to record my screen for the fun of it, after all I was running 120 FPS average. Big mistake (Not quite sure what I was thinking anymore now). I immediately dropped to the 10-20 FPS zone and eventually my pc crashed, and gave me the blue screen of death. I figured I shouldn't try that anymore, as I probably maxed out the RAM or CPU. I'd just have to play League with nothing else open. Except, when I launched the LoL launcher, it crashed. i didn't even see the sign in menu. I literally just pushed the Launch button, then just blue screen. This had me worried. I've uninstalled and reinstalled LoL several times, restarted my PC, even resorted to a back up. Nothing worked. I am honestly at a loss. I don't know enough about LoL to see if their is an additional process or anything I can just close. I am planning to redownload the drivers even though I literally updated them a week ago from today.  Here are my dump files, I figure you guys could use them. Admittedly, there are 2 in there from trying to restart the pc that ended in crashes, but it seems fine now. They might help though so I've included them. Also, I checked my PC for heat and dust. There was nothing. No dust, and I could even touch the parts and only feel a mild warmth. Clothes fresh out of the dryers were hotter than the part were. ( I unplugged the PSU and checked the ambient temp before I did so of course. And no, I did not touch any contacts. I'm not an idiot)\r\n\r\nLinks: \r\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/cs6yn8p74n2fq0e/102116-26442-01.dmp?dl=0\r\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/d93vkglpc5ep1g7/102116-32307-01.dmp?dl=0\r\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/7t0oww5mi11g5j4/102116-23415-01.dmp?dl=0\r\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/5qb785fcmwne8cw/102116-21200-01.dmp?dl=0\r\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/jzmmrwjzd3yuygl/102116-20155-01.dmp?dl=0\r\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/5tshy8vp4d29geq/102116-18751-01.dmp?dl=0\r\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/cmey7k5eij6zzo8/102116-18220-01.dmp?dl=0\r\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/scynx6in4u4rgbw/102016-18829-01.dmp?dl=0\r\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/hcrcfi4d9xky4l8/080316-14071-01.dmp?dl=0\r\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/nblxe61cehdxj7f/080116-22042-01.dmp?dl=0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI apologize for the multitude, i couldn't figure out how to share them all with just one.\r\n\r\nAlso, on a side note, I'm also a new player. Any Evelynn tips? I've done enough bot matches so as I'm at the point where I can jungle without a leash, although it's much faster and easier with one. I'm only LvL 11 tho, so not quite with as much HP as I want. Will bot matches help me anymore or should I just jump into PvP? And I also seem to be a bit lackluster in terms of damage. How should I itemize? I typically finish Runic Echoes on Skirmisher's Saber, grab basic boots somewhere along the way and upgrade them into what ever stat I seem to need when I have the gold, and start on Lichbane after that. Then, I just build what I need although it is usually a protobelt next. Or does the Rift thing (before baron) really do that much for Evelynn?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-22T16:23:54.314+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I appreciate the troubleshooting you've done so far; though, I wasn't able to pull the attachments you provided.
