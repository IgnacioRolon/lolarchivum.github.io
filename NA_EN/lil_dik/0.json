There are thousands of teams looking to fill specific competitive roles but I don&#039;t have the time for scheduled practices, nor the desire to jump on TS every time I want to play a game.\n\nLoL is one of the largest online games on the market yet there seems to be a lack of large supportive groups. I&#039;m thinking along the lines of large 100+ player clans, not small groups of friends. \n\nSo, if anyone knows of a good group of people, I&#039;d love to join it.\n\n_About me:\nGrown man. 23y/o\nI play a few games per day, random times. \nI play for fun, not to win. Although winning is fun too.\nSometimes a little trollish... {{champion:61}} & {{champion:432}}  support..._\n\nUpdate: **Send me an invite in game to join a group. I am still looking for a larger group to join so when I/we find one, we will merge. **","replies":[{"poster":"Lil Dik","date":"2016-09-13T07:25:41.573+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just throw me, Lil Dik, a friend invite and I'll send everyone a clan request.
