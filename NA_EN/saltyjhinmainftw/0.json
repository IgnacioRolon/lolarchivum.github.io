But have gotten no response after a day. My league has recently been giving me the error that i have a data corruption. The first time it happens is a few days ago when i got league from a friend because it was out of date and mine didn't work properly. I was playing a lot of World Of warcraft. So i start it up and it doesn't open. I then search this on the boards and i found something. I deleted everything in Rads>projects. Except for lol_air_client. I then opened my launcher and it installed about 4gb. I let it run overnight. In the morning i could play. 2 Days after that it happened again and i had to do it again. Then it was at least 3-4 days before it accured again and this time i was going into Ranked and lost 3 lp after fixing it which was fine. The next day it happened again and i lost 20lp and got 5min lpq. I then fixed it and the next day it happened again... this time losing 17lp and 10 min lpq. I went to fetch my friend's files then and it worked. But after my 3rd game it crashed as we were about to win. We won and i got the LP but i got Data Curroption AGAIN. This is really getting annoying now I cant go on like this mostly because it takes a lot of time. 3-5 Hours just for the patch up of the data corruption. It's probably something with my computer but i don't know what. I use Windows 10.\r\nPlease let me know how i can fix this. Thank you {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{summoner:3}}","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-08T22:54:04.391+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like repairs just aren't going to cut it anymore, and your installation has corruption that a repair cannot resolve. To deal with this, I recommend grabbing our [Hextech Repair Tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752674-Network-System-and-League-of-Legends-Logs) for a clean reinstall of the client. After installing the tool, run it and select the boxes for both **'reinstall'** and **'clean uninstall'**. After the tool is finished, launch League so it can finish patching.\n\nLet me know if this helped.","replies":[]}]}
