Every time I click on hextech crafting my league client stops, and so does seemingly every other process running at the time, windows explorer included.\r\n\r\nThe computer freezes for about 10 mins every time I've tested this.\r\n\r\nI've tried repairing the game, didn't work.\r\n\r\nI don't have plays.tv, AMD gaming evolved or curse Overwolf, the closest would be the nVidea equivalent and that feature is disabled too.\r\n\r\nI'd appreciate any word on riot from this issue, it's getting to be quite annoying.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-31T04:50:32.908+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm... I haven't heard of this happening for a while. First, I'd recommend [running a clean boot](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting#wq3) to ensure 100% this isn't caused by a background application. If you still have issues, this may be caused by your client going into a weird loop of not being able to connect to the servers properly. In this case, I'd recommend working through our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to ensure your local network settings are good to go.\n\nLet me know if you still have issues.","replies":[{"poster":"Shafty Senpai","date":"2016-11-02T07:14:38.236+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tried both, issues still happening. The freezing occurs before I even get a chance to see what I have, the window is still black when the client crashes.\n\nIf it helps, I can quickly click out of the craft menu the moment I click it (the freezing occurs about 3-4 seconds after entering the screen), and the league client won't freeze, but the rest of the PC will.\n\nNow this might actually be a hardware issue now that I've looked at the performance. When I click the league hextech crafting menu, the disc usage suddenly jumps up to 100% on disc 0 (which is drive c and drive d for me) while disc 1 (drive e and f) show no changes in disc use. An issue with my device is that i'm pretty sure drive e and f aren't working properly since my disc usage is capping at 50%, so is the hextech crafting menu extremely taxing on a PC? Because if so that's that'll probably be the issue.\n\nFor clarity's sake, I've installed lol on drive C, not e or f.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-02T21:37:18.297+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gotcha, thanks for giving me more context. I think running some hardware tests would be a good next step.
