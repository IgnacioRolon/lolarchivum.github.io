It was previously QTPie448. I decided to change it because 1) I had made my name when I was dating my now ex boyfriend, and it was a pet name he used to call me, and 2) whenever I would play I would get people who would see it and be like OMG THAT'S QTPIE!! **Note- I am not the real qtpie,** I had no idea there was a streamer/player by that name when I created this account. I changed it because I don't want anything to do with my ex.\r\n\r\nNow though whenever I sign into the boards or the League client, I still have to use my old name to sign in, and not my new name. Is there a way I can change that so I can sign in with my new name?\r\n\r\nThanks for your help.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-17T00:55:33.236+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think what you're asking about is your **Username**(don't share it publicly, it's sensitive info), which is what's used for login. This cannot be changed and forever remains tied to your account if it remains on the same region. You can change you Summoner Name, which is what others see, but they'll never see your **Username**, since it's only used for login.\n\nIf you really need to move away from this **Username**, you'll have to create a new account entirely, if you intend to stay on the NA region. Let me know if you have any questions!","replies":[{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2017-01-17T14:32:39.614+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you set aside the monetary cost, is it possible to change from NA to (say) EUW then back to NA in order to get a different Username?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-18T03:42:29.861+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nope, you'd have the same username if you transferred to another region and transferred back. As I mentioned above, you actually have to create a new account if you want a different username and would like to remain on the same region. Usernames are unique to an account and will stay with them on the region for the life of the account.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
