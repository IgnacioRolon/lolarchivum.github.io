The main difference here is that the latter ones may be poking fun at your opponents, but they aren't insulting them or attributing often negative attributes to them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2018-06-14T00:31:00.857+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"can i get banned for antagonizing other players?\"\n\n\n{{sticker:sg-lux-2}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"VindicatorOFThey","date":"2018-06-14T00:47:10.619+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"My friend told me that , if u call people nerds you are complimenting them , cause nerds are smart .\nBUT IDK","replies":[{"poster":"simphonia","date":"2019-05-07T10:49:15.095+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"very few of them. rest just typical incels","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Silent Gravity","date":"2018-06-14T00:37:23.577+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The IFS doesn't care what words you use.
