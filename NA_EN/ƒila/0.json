Potential Zyra skins?","subforum":"Concepts & Creations","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"With the recent release of another ultimate skin and other high quality skins such as the star guardian line, or the pool party and arcade skins, they are starting to make other skins seem &quot;not as good&quot; anymore. But what about for the Champions, like {{champion:143}} or {{champion:6}}, (And a ton more of champions as well) who haven&#039;t even received new skins recently at all or talk of it either. \r\n\r\nI think {{champion:143}} deserves a new skin and a concept I believe would be pretty interesting would be something like Death blossom {{champion:121}}, but more like Death blossom {{champion:143}}. What are some other potential skins for {{champion:143}} you would like to see?","replies":[{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2016-12-07T01:29:06.657+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How about {{champion:420}} gets a new skin?\n\nShe has yet to get one and she is the oldest champ with only 1 skin.
