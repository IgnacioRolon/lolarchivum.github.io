When I went to login later that day, I typed my login stuff in and click login and it just shows \"Authenticating...\". If it doesn't show \"Authenticating...\" it tells me, \"an unexpected error has occurred while logging in. Please try again.\" and gives me the riot support link. I've went through the connection guide. Some guide dealing with Internet Explorer. I even uninstalled, restarted my computer, and reinstalled it. Nothing is working. Can anyone help me?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-03-19T02:48:18.626+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since your patcher is throwing an unexpected error before you even login, this may be an issue where your pc is blocking the patcher entirely. If your pc doesn't have all the right permissions set up, it can sometimes stop the patcher from connecting to our servers at all, which would cause you to see this error.
