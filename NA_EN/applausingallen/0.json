For example, I had the last pick in rank, sometimes I was struggling with what champ should I play or which one work best for the team and it took almost the whole time. Because of the delay, I locked in the champ I chose before cuz that champ remained on the screen. And also, it's so hard to open the masteries page as well. Sometimes it just stuck there and not pups up.\r\nI hope riot can fix that but I just wanna see how many 'APPLE' players have the same problem","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-23T03:25:39.975+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Some players experience some performance issues in the Beta Client as a result of limited system resources. You may be able to resolve this by jumping into the client settings (cog icon, top-right) and **enabling** \"Low Spec mode\" and **disabling** \"Animation\".\n\nhttp://image.prntscr.com/image/598e949fe2904c85b3220875cf13760f.png\n\nLet me know if this helped!","replies":[]}]}
