So here goes nothin\n\nTechnically, yes Fiora's W is an AOE (It has an area of effect, it isn't a point and click) although it only affects one target. I didn't think I'd have to mention that since it's in lane and it's usually 1v1 (she's a duelist if you didn't know)\n\n\" You mean the 0.75 second parry that doesn't parry damage from towers?\"\n\nAgain, we're comparing champions, so yes, I still count it as full damage reduction (Garen isn't a tower)\n\n\"Garen W only lasts 2 seconds holy wow, that is such a small amount of time. AND only 6 seconds at max level?\"\n\nIf you still can't read, I said \" only lasts 2 seconds total until you put more points into it at the end of the game.\" Now, as we know, Garen is supposed to be an early/mid champ, meaning he falls off and becomes kinda useless near the end of the game, which is when you get the 6 seconds at level 18.\n\n\" free resists that up to 40 armor and magic resist wow.\"\n\nThis is partially a lie, since Garen's armor per level was put down as well as his hp per level. Meaning even though it _sounds_ like you're getting a lot from his W passive, you're actually getting about 20 more armor, 40 magic resist (which is nice but doesn't really matter that much in lane), and 200 _less_ health compared to other juggernauts/bruisers\n\n\"You mean Camille's in lane sustain that is countered by dodging her W?\"\n\nShe can move at full movement speed while charging it up, it's kinda hard to _miss_ if we're being honest\n\n\"I guess Garen's passive that heals you by doing nothing isn't enough then.\"\n\nLevel 1-10 (basically most of laning phase) Garen's passive is slightly less useful than a refillable potion, also, it's on a 9 second cooldown during any instance of champion damage he takes, so it's not even doing anything half the time.\n\nAlso on top of that, like I said with his W, his base hp regen and regen per level is lower than other juggernauts because of his passive\n\n\" I fail to see how a 20% hp shield is better than 30% damage reduction for 2-6 seconds, 60% damage reduction and tenacity for the first 0.75 seconds, and 40 armor and magic resist by simply last hitting.\"\n\nThe tenacity is nice sometimes, but the cooldown on that shield goes down to 10 seconds, and it scales off max hp (which is good for Garen). So I'd get to use that shield twice as much as Garen's W, which would make his 1v1s and laning in general a lot easier.","replies":[{"poster":"Razelth","date":"2019-01-22T13:54:33.933+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"You mentioned aoe attack speed/movement speed slow.

I'm pretty sure they teach you that in middle school, so give it a few more years.\n\nHim falling off doesn't matter. Don't bring random points in. He gets a 6 second 30% damage reduction lategame. That sounds like a big deal to me, especially when he has nearly 4k hp in the late game and 150+ resists.\n\nGaren gets 40 free resists, that is not partially a lie, it is the complete truth.\n\nI guess Darius's in lane sustain is broken too then? He can move at full movement speed while charging it up, it's kinda hard to hit on a player using a fraction of their brain if we're being honest.\n\nDo you want to use math or should I? 20% hp shield vs 30% damage reduction for 6 seconds?
