Please help me. \n\nThe detail is as below:\n\nI believed a liar who told me to charge RP on my level 17 account , so I gave him the id and password. Then I couldn't log in that account! Apparently he changed the password. The most disappointing part is that I didn't connect that account with my email, so when I'm pressing \"forget my password\" to change my password, it seems that the liar has connected it with an email. It cost me lots of time to play on this little account and I have lots of friends there !!! Please help me get back the account.!!!!! Thank you!!! I will connect it with my email immediately I get it back.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTo contact with me, my email is --------------------------------------- (You see it's the same word as my stolen account's password before it was changed)\n\nBy the way, the liar's id is  \"-------------------\", it's lvl 7 so maybe it's not his main account. He told me he was a  korean streamer... LOL I was so stupid to trust him.\n\nPlease help me !","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-18T01:18:33.333+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah man, sorry to hear you got scammed like that.
