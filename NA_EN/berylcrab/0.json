Anyone else experience this or have any idea how to fix it?\n\nIt is not my mouse as that was my first thought and i went and got a new one, same problem.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-19T16:23:41.964+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry to hear about these mouse issues, though it's good you tried another mouse to rule out that possibility.  Your config settings might be correct as well and not responding properly.  See if a config reset might fix this:\n\nLog into the game client.\nNavigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\nDelete the file  named **game.cfg** and **persistedsettings.json**\nGo into a custom game and verify that settings have saved properly.  Leave game to sync settings.","replies":[]}]}
