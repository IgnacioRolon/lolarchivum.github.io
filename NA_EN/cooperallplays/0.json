However, one day, as my game is loading up (Not the launcher, when you actually click join game and you reach a loading screen) my game crashed. I didn't think of this as anything, so I just closed out of the bug reporter and everything and rebooted league. This was a week ago. I have yet to play a game of league, and I've actually gotten temp-banned trying to join games and not being able to see anything, then force quitting. Below are the console messages outputted when I tried to join my own custom game with just me and a bot. Please help, thanks.\r\n\r\n6/11/16 7:37:45.349 PM com.apple.xpc.launchd[1]: (com.apple.imfoundation.IMRemoteURLConnectionAgent) The _DirtyJetsamMemoryLimit key is not available on this platform.\r\n6/11/16 7:38:10.874 PM LeagueofLegends[942]: BugSplatFramework: initWithDatabase: defaultExceptionHandler is set\r\n6/11/16 7:38:15.356 PM WindowServer[138]: Display 0x4273c00 captured by conn 0x145e3\r\n6/11/16 7:38:15.435 PM LeagueofLegends[942]: notify name \"com.apple.coregraphics.GUIConsoleSessionChanged\" has been registered 20 times - this may be a leak\r\n6/11/16 7:38:15.493 PM identityservicesd[262]: : notification observer: com.apple.iChat   notification: __CFNotification 0x7f927ac5e3a0 {name = _NSDoNotDisturbEnabledNotification}\r\n6/11/16 7:38:15.503 PM sharingd[256]: 19:38:15.502 : Discoverable mode changed to Off\r\n6/11/16 7:38:15.504 PM sharingd[256]: 19:38:15.503 : BTLE scanning stopped\r\n6/11/16 7:38:15.517 PM identityservicesd[262]: :    NC Disabled: NO\r\n6/11/16 7:38:15.522 PM identityservicesd[262]: :   DND Enabled: YES\r\n6/11/16 7:38:15.522 PM identityservicesd[262]: : Updating enabled: NO   (Topics: (\r\n))\r\n6/11/16 7:38:27.091 PM identityservicesd[262]: : notification observer: com.apple.iChat   notification: __CFNotification 0x7f927ae7c620 {name = _NSDoNotDisturbDisabledNotification}\r\n6/11/16 7:38:27.110 PM identityservicesd[262]: :    NC Disabled: NO\r\n6/11/16 7:38:27.115 PM identityservicesd[262]: :   DND Enabled: NO\r\n6/11/16 7:38:27.116 PM identityservicesd[262]: : Updating enabled: YES   (Topics: (\r\n))\r\n6/11/16 7:38:27.139 PM sharingd[256]: 19:38:27.138 : Discoverable mode changed to Contacts Only\r\n6/11/16 7:38:27.139 PM sharingd[256]: 19:38:27.138 : BTLE scanning started\r\n6/11/16 7:38:27.139 PM sharingd[256]: 19:38:27.138 : Scanning mode Contacts Only\r\n6/11/16 7:38:27.140 PM sharingd[256]: 19:38:27.140 : BTLE scanner Powered On\r\n6/11/16 7:38:27.235 PM WindowServer[138]: Display 0x4273c00 released by conn 0x145e3\r\n6/11/16 7:38:27.609 PM mdworker[952]: code validation failed in the process of getting signing information: Error Domain=NSOSStatusErrorDomain Code=-67062 \"The operation couldn’t be completed.

When this happens, press the enter key a bunch of times. That will probably fix the issue.\n\nIf the client is blacked out outside loading (via champ select, or the client), it's probably a networking or 3rd party issue messing with the client, then probably best to optimize your network.\n\nBest!","replies":[{"poster":"CooperallPlays","date":"2016-06-12T14:19:50.524+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you so much, it worked!","replies":[{"poster":"Prynce","date":"2016-06-12T17:41:46.654+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"no prob fam, bless up","replies":[]}]}]}]}
