I have followed all the tips provided from Riot on optimizing for LoL. I did a completely clean install of Sierra OS and there is no improvement. All hardware was inspected by an Apple genius at the Apple store, so I am out of ideas. I read some chatter about this on an EU forum but no solution, so it seems like I am not alone.\r\n\r\nHas anyone ran into this issue and found a fix?","replies":[{"poster":"Fooleek Return","date":"2017-06-21T13:55:15.134+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same for me here.

Every patch seems to have the same fps lag problem for a few days. my normal 60 drops to 15-20 in fights.
