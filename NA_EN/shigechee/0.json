That's why my playing is pro-like. Why people is attacking only me?\"\n\nAre these teams appropriate to the game which Riot Games hosts?","replies":[{"poster":"OhOkYeah","date":"2015-02-17T08:49:33.692+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"OP no need to be racist.

RFLegendary has lost one game by humble reason in his stream. He lost his chance to make more subscriber or donation. This is economic injury.\n2. Yutapongo has lost one game by behavior that pro player shouldn't be. He hurt pro-career of both himself and his team. And he lost his chance to promote to bigger team. On the contrary, current team got a good reason to fire him or impose penalty to him.\n3. Japanese players who aim at international activity will lose their chance to join foreign pro team. Yutapongo has made the words \"Japanese sucks\".\n4. Pro players has many Spectators. They will recognize they are allowed to ragequit. Pro player does it in high-ranked games, why we can't? This will provides many innocent players worse game experience.\n5. Riot Games got a bunch of bad players, their business will get stacked up. Japan Server? E-sports? Are you kidding me?\n\nThe most important thing is Yutapongo is not aware of them as one of professional. \nThis is the reason I titled this article \"lacks of professionalism\".","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Shigechee","date":"2015-02-17T10:31:18.671+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Shigechee,realm=NA,application-id=9hBQwnEU,discussion-id=ekTBKlsl,comment-id=00010001,timestamp=2015-02-17T10:03:50.686+0000)\n> I just don't want non-Japanese people to recognize these behavior as Japanese culture.\n\nI don't want Japanese either.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2015-02-17T08:53:22.280+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"???\n\nWhat?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-02-17T08:20:58.010+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Tbh unless they physically or verbally assault people, why wouldn't they be allowed just because their behaviours don't fit the categories of \"professionalism\"?\n\nAgain I stopped watching/caring about pro scene since the end of S2.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ImaChickIRL","date":"2015-02-17T10:33:18.460+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"what a stupid fucking thread.","replies":[]}]}
