I need to simply change my email address on my account to an updated email address.  I'm not aware of how to do that other than through a support request.  \r\n\r\nNot sure if Riot support staff check these forums but I really need help with this asap.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance!\r\n\r\nMost recent ticket number is  22746931","replies":[{"poster":"hunt","date":"2016-08-10T01:06:47.591+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you, they responded when I posted this but still haven't resolved the issue, which is that i need an email change on the account not just a password reset.\n\nHopefully they will respond soon.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-09T23:36:19.548+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As DTN mentioned, you can try their method if you have access to the current email associated with your account. If you don't, you'll need to continue to be patient while an account specialist gets back to you. Response times can vary depending on how many tickets are in that team's queue and where your ticket is in that queue. Avoid \"bumping\" your ticket, as it sends it to the back of the queue and only lengthens the time it takes for someone to get back to you.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-08-09T22:00:47.549+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you still have access to the current email? If so, you can verify a new email by clicking your profile on the top right here and going to **Settings**.\n\nIf you do *not* have access to the email, you'll need to submit an account recovery [Support Ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). If that is the kind you've already done, please be patient; Player Support will get to your ticket as soon as possible, but it may take a few days or more depending on ticket backlog. Account management issues can take a bit longer as they'll need to verify you are the original owner of the account first.\n\n(submitting new tickets slows down the whole system, and bumping your ticket pushes it to the back of the queue)","replies":[]}]}
