The only thing Dyn Q solved was getting your role which was the least important problem and wasn't even a real issue except for scrubs in bronze who all wanted to go mid or kids who can't handle not getting wtf they want. You don't answer spoiled people by treating them like kings. You humble them.\n\nI doubt it but if you really need evidence to tell you why a 3-5 premade is unfair against a full team of strangers, then you're a moron. And why should I consider your opinion?

Gathering 4 worthy friends to play games with ALL the time was a huge hassle, and if you have more than one friend to play with then that means that someone is left out of the dark, DQ made it possible to have 3 to 5 man premades and thus helped co-operation in the team. this does have problems though. If there is a 4 man premade then that means that the one remaining player is often singled out and ignored. That sucks. But it's better than my soloQ experience, which is where everyone just kinda did their own thing without any concern of anybody else and overall there was almost no co-operation period (except for ADC and Support, which requires it)\n2.) While facing a five man premade as an entirely solo team is aggravating, and being the one left out on a 4 man premade is just as aggravating, it's not impossible to say that the same couldn't happen in solo Q. There were many times where lets say the mid-laner and the jungler were duo together, well that means that our jungler is going to gank our mid-lane a lot and kinda leave bot lane out of the picture.

Back in the days of Solo Q, you still had your good team players but most people relied on their own skill to rank up. If they improved their skill, they would rank up gradually. And everyone believed they earn the rank. NOW, you depend on your teammates for the win. Ranking up isn't about getting better. It's about stacking your team with as much talent and cooperation as possible. Therefore the game is won before the queue is even set up? That's what you're trying to promote? A system that doesn't reward you for skill or doing stuff correctly. A system that rewards you for stacking advantages before a match can even begin champ select?

You act like people can be such good friends that they can predict each-others moves and as someone that plays with his best-friend of 8 years I can assure you that this is not true. Even when I am at his house and he is mere 3 feet away from me, there are STILL times where we are not properly communicating and mistakes happen. The advantage of DQ is that chances are premades will be in a skype call and have the advantage of communicating instantly instead of using pings (which can be vague) or the chatbox (which takes time and takes you away from the game). But there is NOTHING about DQ that says that unless you are a premade you can't get into a skype call.\n\nAs far as you claiming that your elos are so full of nice players that work well with their team no matter who they are...I'm calling bullshit. \nDon't misunderstand me, I know that working well with your team increases your odds of winning, and more wins equals a higher elo of course. But everyone talks about toxicity in this game and it's not just Bronze players that encounter it. Toxicity happens across all elos (except maybe challenger and diamond). Thus, if toxic players exist in your elo then your argument that your elo consists of people that work with their team is {{champion:38}} null and void. \n\nIf you are such a teamplayer that works so well with EVERYONE then there is no difference between a premade and solo team and you shouldn't be bitching\n\nOnce again I will state an argument that you have failed to address. \n\nLet me sum up your argument ok?\n\n1.) Premades can consist of 2-5 players. \n2.) These players are friends.\n3.) These players will work together as a team because they are friends\n4.) Better teamwork equals a better chance of winning obviously. \n5.) This form of better teamwork over-cedes soloq's players with better skill.\n6.) This is unfair to soloq players. \n\nThis is MY counter-argument \n1.)K\n2.) Premades aren't always friends, they could have just added each-other because they got along well from a previous match\n3.)These players will work together as a team better because they are probably in a skype call. \n4.)K\n5.) Teamwork IS A SKILL. Depending on which skills you are good at or bad at, some skills over-cede another. For example, if I am a great {{champion:4}} so I willingly walk into mid against a counter I am probably going to lose lane. Great at ganking? They could be great at warding. Great at roaming? They could be great at pushing etc. There are methods you can use to improve these various skills before the game even starts. Don't willingly walk into a counter pick. Use effective R+M's. Pick the champion that fits both YOUR needs and YOUR TEAM'S needs. Take the proper summoner spells. Chat with your team your game plan (like if you are going to roam a lot, or stay in lane, if you need a gank, if you need someone to ward your red, etc). As far as teamwork goes, one way to improve this skill is to use skype, which premades often use. Premades are a mechanic or League now and instead of simply bashing it constantly, perhaps you should use it, like an new item or champion.

Also Riot said for years that premades of 3-5 are unfair in a rank setting where solo/duo queue players might be in. Dude it's proven. You can call bullshit all you want. All pro player streamers have already called bullshit on Dynamic Queue being fair and competitive. A lot of streamers with high rank and high game knowledge are on record saying Dyn Q makes the game unfair. Riot was on record BEFORE dynamic queue ever came out talking about premades of 3-5 is unfair to solo/duo queues.\n\nSomeone brought up interesting point of duo queue also being unfair to solo queue only players; Riot responded again 3-5 is a dominant number of a team. 60% OR MORE. This was a huge argument when they first implemented Team Builder and people demanded team builder implementation in rank. Riot's claim was they won't because you cannot counter-pick, it was like blind pick, and it would be unfair for solo and duo players. That's why there was a huge backlash against Dynamic Queue. Because Riot said it was bad for competition and toxicity for years already. And yet again... here you are. Saying it's all bullshit. And that it's all in our heads. A bronze player who can't understand a simple concept of why dominant premade queue (stacking advantages before a champ selection even begins) is bullshit that plenty of high ranked players and even the company of the game went on record to say otherwise.","replies":[{"poster":"Hay5eed","date":"2016-07-04T21:16:03.625+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This just in.

Like I could believe that 85% of the player base cannot compete at challenger level but to say that 85% of them are just plain ass? Yeah I'm not buying it. \n\n> Back in the days of Solo Q, you still had your good team players but most people relied on their own skill to rank up. If they improved their skill, they would rank up gradually. And everyone believed they earn the rank. NOW, you depend on your teammates for the win. Ranking up isn't about getting better. It's about stacking your team with as much talent and cooperation as possible.\n\nand then there is\n\n> No one saying Solo Q = only you and your actions determine whether you win or not\n\nThis sure does look like a contradiction to me\n\n","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
