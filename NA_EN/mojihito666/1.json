We’re sensitive to any large swath of players feeling like they’re losing their place in League and while we firmly believe in Dynamic Ranked as the future, the game’s social features don’t offer enough support for players looking for like-minded, similarly-skilled players today.

That he later decided to resign doesn't change anything.\n\n Dynamic queue was a response to people demanding a true solo queue. People were complaining about premade duos since ever. So at the end of season 5 they announced they were making a queue for premades (DQ) and solo queue would finally be just that. Then they said DQ would be the only queue around. Now they're bringing back the old duo queue as if that was what everyone wanted all along, which it isn't. This \"raise taxes by 40% so you can later be thanked for lowering them 10%\" tactic Riot is using is wrong. Feel free to buy into it though.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
