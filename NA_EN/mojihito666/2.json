Riot could actually take some steps to slow game pacing a bit and mitigate early snowballing so that we don't have to FF at 15 and that most games aren't even /ff worthy.  I know, I know, fantasy land type of stuff that will never happen, but it's an idea that's crazy enough to work!\n\nAs it stands currently, 90% of the games I play are decided one way or the other at 15 minutes, at least 70% are decided at 10 minutes.  \n\nSince patch 8.1 I can only recall one game in which a 'comeback' occurred.  Most games are incredibly one sided, even the few games that aren't basically end after one team wins a team fight in mid, destroys the base in 20 seconds and that's it.  \n\nThe 'tug-of-war', back-and-forth type of games are clearly an anomaly anymore.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jbels","date":"2018-02-26T17:24:19.968+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Surrender at 15 was an indication of the horrible direction Riot has taken League in.

So that is fine.  And as far as disco Nunu, or trolls in general: I've played a fair amount for three or so years now and I MIGHT have run into two true trolls.  \n\nOpen mid is ridiculous.  People will try to open for being down 3 kills.  That does not mean you have lost.  That means you won't steamroll.  It means you will have to work for it.  But people don't want to do that.  \n\nNo game is truly lost at ten minutes.  I have honestly never seen that happen.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
