It had a place in his kit before, but theres no reason to kee it.\n\nHe doesnt get any AD from his ghost anymore. \n\nThe AD his ghost will receive is unrelated to what he builds.\n\nThe god damn patch notes say that \"AD MORDEKAISER IS NOT A THING\"\n\n\nThat bonus AD ratio only serves to make him build Gunblade over WotA a few times, and it is taking from his power budget, since he is not rewarded for building AD anymore. \n\nThere is no point in keeping that. Since you are obviously not going to revert this crap, at least get rid of the ratio you domt want him using and buff him elsewhere.","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-02-28T19:45:25.507+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can not see why he is now pigeonholed into an AP fighter with no cc, ok damage and have an unreliable mobility because that's *clearly *a fleshed out idea right?\n\nHe was meant to be mostly AP with sometimes hybrid, due to his immobility he is meant to be a powerhouse, utilising power he can get his hands on and pushing the lane while dueling anybody who is willing to go toe to toe against him, and most likely ended up as his slave afterwards.

I mean, he's ***melee***.  That's the primary definition for Fighter.  If you were melee and you didn't have some other major role (tank or support), you're called a Fighter.  The other definition of \"Fighter\" is being close to the fight, assuming you were not melee.\n\nIf Braum wasn't classified as a Support, he'd be rated as Tank/Fighter.  Morde, however, is not a true tank.

It says absolutely nothing about playstyle or gives any insight into the role of a champion. It's pointless to ever talk about \"fighters\" using your definition because the discussion apparently needs to generalize everything from galio to garen to morde to tryndamere. Champions that are nothing alike and which have no general pattern to talk about outside of what is already encapsulated by the word \"melee\".\n\nYou don't actually see \"fighter\" as clarifying role or characteristics more than the word \"melee\", you just see it as some catch all category that describes things that didn't fit anywhere else. So to you \"we're making morde a fighter\" just means \"We're making morde a melee lacking cc to lock things down. What does he do exactly?
