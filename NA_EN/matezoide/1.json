This mostly applies to snowball champs like {{champion:92}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:107}}. You're better off getting really good at laning with these champs and snowballing lane with {{summoner:14}}, because what you want with these champs is kill pressure. {{summoner:12}} is better for laners that are actually good at teamfights, setting up ganks when they tp, and have good dragon control. This is also better for a champ that doesn't have good early, so this allows them to back safely to buy then pop back in lane. {{summoner:12}} isn't good on all champs and playstyles, stop enforcing the meta.","replies":[{"poster":"OperationDEEZ1","date":"2015-07-25T20:18:06.818+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Enforcing the meta?

People have this idea that {{summoner:12}} is a complete must for top lane.

You need to all in him, so he can't even stay in lane anymore or outright kill him.
