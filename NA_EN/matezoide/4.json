I've been in one game where my team was getting rocked badly midgame.  We had me on Jinx and a Master Yi who whenever we had a breather would head out to split push.  (me usually bottom, him usually top).  Eventually we managed to take all 3 inhibitor turrets and that meant if I could get to their base I'd get at least 2 inhibitors before they could recall to stop me.  (admittedly the other team had horrible warding and map awareness which allowed me to get to their base without challenge again and again.)  In the end my team won because our constant taking out of the inhibitors prevented the other team from rushing us and we caught up on gold at about 55 minutes.\n\nJinx is immobile and most times will die quickly if you 2v1 her as she can't escape, but if the other team doesn't challenge her she can split push amazingly well thanks to her wave clear and ability to take down towers.  Her passive even helps because she gets the speed boost when the tower goes down which does allow her to escape if you recall and try to charge at her from the base.","replies":[{"poster":"BluePolarizer","date":"2015-03-02T20:42:21.955+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A good splitpusher needs to take towers and minion waves fast, but most importantly, needs to be able to duel 1v1 and escape 2v1s.

If you can actually get in her face, she isnt that scary.\n\nJinx a poor duelist?  Jinx is probably the best pure duelist of all the ADCs if she uses her minigun and has built any attack speed.  With her Q to level 5 and using her minigun she has the highest attack speed in the game once it gets to 3 stacks, that's why she can crush turrets so well.  Yes, anyone with decent armor can probably survive long enough to kill her in a 1v1, but I've beaten quite a few good melee duelists mid and late game in a 1v1 if I have any life steal and don't let them get the first attack in.  And once you get the kill, you can run away.\n\nIn fact if I am splitpushing and someone comes to 1v1 me, I'll stand and fight rather than run.  In that situation I win probably 60-70% of the duels.  I then try to run away from any follow up attacks.  It's the 2v1 attacks that crush most of my splitpush attempts on Jinx.","replies":[{"poster":"BluePolarizer","date":"2015-03-02T22:46:01.701+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"she can't duel well because she has only dps and one steroid, no burst, cc, slipperiness or tankiness. all the champs i listed have most of the above. it is very hard to outduel jax, yi or riven as an immobile adc with equal gold because they get alot of things in their kits that money can't buy. it is hard to not let melee duelists get the first hit 1v1 because most have gapclosers and once they are in your face they have better base stats and dueling kits with dodges, shields, stuns, etc. ","replies":[{"poster":"I am never good","date":"2015-03-05T23:34:15.154+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=BluePolarizer,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=HfZ7F8wF,comment-id=00000000000000000001,timestamp=2015-03-02T22:46:01.701+0000)\n>\n> she can't duel well because she has only dps and one steroid, no burst, cc, slipperiness or tankiness. all the champs i listed have most of the above. it is very hard to outduel jax, yi or riven as an immobile adc with equal gold because they get alot of things in their kits that money can't buy. it is hard to not let melee duelists get the first hit 1v1 because most have gapclosers and once they are in your face they have better base stats and dueling kits with dodges, shields, stuns, etc.\n\nHave you ever even seen Jinx in game?

(she actually has the lowest base attack speed of all the ADCs at level 18)  But that doesn't mean she's perfect.\n\nVayne is far better late game than Jinx\nAshe has much better CC and can use her ult to initiate\nCorki and Tristana have much better escapes\nCorki and Graves have better burst\nKalista has far more mobility.\n--\nI could go on, but there is no reason to list all the ways other champs are better.\n\nAs for some of your other complaints.\n\nFishbones at level 5 has 700 range, equal to Caitlyn, but not better.  Also after the first 2 shots it goes of Jinx's low base attack speed, not the boosted level she gets for using Pow Pow.  That's her tradeoff.  Range and AOE effect but low attack speed.\n\nsplitpush.  Most good Jinx's don't splitpush just because they are behind.  There are only 2 good times to splitpush.  First, if you are trying to farm, which means the other team should be trying to stop Jinx anyways, as Jinx can/will eventually kill enough minions to catch up if you don't move to stop her.  Sure it means you don't push the other base as hard, but a team trying to team fight without an ADC is at a disadvantage.  So the other team should take advantage of it.  The second is if the team Jinx is on is behind, but can hold on in team fights 4v5.  Then Jinx is like a Nasus or Udyr in that her ability to shred towers can relieve pressure on their own base as the other team has to recall to deal with her.\n\nBut having Jinx away from the teamfight leaves her damage dealing capability out of the fight, which does her team no favors.  Even a weak Jinx can throw down an impressive amount of damage if she can single out a target and use PowPow's AS boost with her auto-attacks.  That's where she should be.  (and almost every double and triple kill I've gotten on her has involved using her minigun, not Fishbones - a few have involved perfectly timed ults)\n\nBut she isn't perfect.  I've had games where I've had the other team steamroll me and make sure that I never would get back on track.  A Jinx without much farm can't do much to help her team and is a liability at times as she's a slow and squishy target.  Teams that focus her early in teamfights can prevent her from getting back in the game and often use killing her as a entry into wiping out the other side in the teamfight.\n\n---\nTL,DR:  Learn a bit more about Jinx before you complain.  She's good, and popular because she's fun to play, but its not impossible to defeat her.
