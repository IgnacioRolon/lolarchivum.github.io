They obviously shouldn't give him CC, and in my opinion, his role should be the mage you just can't kill. His kit should be oriented heavily towards DPS (lower cooldowns across the board) to keep his shield up consistently, but his burst should be minimized and his kit left clearly as a persistent damage source.

This reduces the base shield at level 1 by 1 health without runes, masteries, or items. At level 18 it reduces the base by 130, but the health scaling increases the total by 153 (net increase of 23) with only base health. This allows a tankier Morde a little more room to breathe late game if he opts into a little health in his items, without drastically changing the scaling of a non tanky Morde.\n\nQ: Base damage and scalings increased to 70/110/150/190/230 (+50% AP) (+100% Bonus AD) (up from 80/110/140/170/200 (+40% AP) (+100% Bonus AD)) and the bonus for hitting only one target adjusted to deal 50% more damage, or 105/165/225/285/345 (+75% AP) (+150% Bonus AD) (up from 132/181.5/231/280.5/330 (+66% AP) (+165% Bonus AD)) These changes shift his power slightly away from his early game damage in favor of better AoE and slightly improved single target damage late game, while also reducing the amount of his power budget sen on an absurdly high bonus AD ratio.\n\nW: Bonus armor and MR changed to 9 (+2 per level) (11-45) from 10/15/20/25/30. Damage changed to also deal 10% combined armor+mr damage per second, for a total of up to 60% armor+MR damage (damage calculated before cast, the stat bonuses it gives are not factored in). AP ratio unchanged. Base damage changed to 14/26/38/50/62 (total 84/156/228/300/372) from 20/32/44/56/68 (total 120/192/264/336/408) (at level 1 he deals slightly less, and at 18 he deals 7.78 more damage per second, or 46.68 more damage total with no items)\n\nE: Cooldown changed to 6/5.5/5/4.5/4 seconds from 6. Base damage lowered to 75/115/155/195/235 from 70/115/160/205/250.

His base damage is really high to be honest. I play him as an AP bruiser with magic penetration, and it works wonders.\n\nHere is my build for Mordekaiser on most games:\n\n{{item:3152}} {{item:3158}} {{item:3001}} {{item:3151}}, {{item:3065}} or {{item:3116}}, and then either {{item:3157}} or {{item:3075}}. If the enemy team is full AD, I use Zhonya instead of Abyssal Scepter. I can swap {{item:3158}} for {{item:3020}} if I am using CDR glyphs, this allows me to deal more damage and still maximize CDR. {{item:3111}} is also an option if the enemy team has too much CC.\n\nThe idea is that Mordekaiser's bases are very high, so I use a build with a lot of flat magic penetration and cooldown reduction. Liandry is also used not only because of the flat magic penetration, but also because of the passive, allowing Mordekaiser do deal with champions late game that tend to have high health pools.\n\nI also use AP items that give resistances or health, allowing Mordekaiser to be tanky while still doing a lot of damage.\n\nSpirit Visage is used for the extra sustain with WotA and his ult, and to patch up his low natural health regeneration. Thornmail is used if the enemy team has a lot of dangerous auto-attacks, and works wonders with his shield. But Zhonya is also an option. It allows Mordekaiser to deal more damage and is recommended if the enemy team has dangerous spells such as Zed's and Karthus' ults. Rylai is a viable option over Spirit Visage to solve Mordekaiser's problem of lacking CC, it also allow him to stick to his targets, while also doubling Liandry's passive damage, allowing Mordekaiser to slowy murder enemies that dare getting close to him.","replies":[{"poster":"BastionKross","date":"2015-07-17T15:51:38.174+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I use a bruiser/DPS Morde build myself. His base damages are really quite high, and with Mpen can be effective even late game with little AP in the overall build. His ratios suck for a burst mage and DFG is gone, so there's no reason to throw tons of AP on him anymore.\n\nUnfortunately, there's little reason to build HP on him either. While more HP is good on every champion (except {{champion:16}}) Morde has less reason to build it than other champions. His shield is supposed to be the main thing keeping him alive, and it scales with resistances. His shields will stay up a lot longer when you have 150/150 AR/MR as opposed to 70/70 and 1000 extra HP. This means that while items like {{item:3151}} {{item:3116}} do give Morde some additional tankiness, %HP damage, and a slow, it's not helping his shield much and probably shouldn't be rushed.\nPart of the reason I like the rework above is that it gives his shield some HP scaling so you can build those items guilt-free.\n\nHowever, having extra HP or AP isn't a bad thing. My core items are {{item:3020}} {{item:3001}} {{item:3068}}. Runes and masteries give me 20% CDR. The MR shred from Abyssal increases the burn of the Sunfire, adding another layer of DPS on top of Morde's W.

Since this build revolves around shredding MR anyway, it's not going to be healing as much as before the recent change. Also, given that most of Morde's abilities are AoE, that's a huge reduction in healing on top. {{item:3146}} would probably be better for healing in the long run, but that's assuming that you build a {{item:3145}} in the first place.

He really doesn't NEED this buff, I'd much rather give him a slow on his E, or consistent MS on his W than have health regen, but I can completely see him using this type of a buff to become a valid pick at higher elo's.\n\n3. Play him for a while, get good at *farming via auto's* and you'll be able to manage him well. Just practice last hitting with auto's, and only push lane when you're playing against a laner who likes to roam (Leblanc, Katarina, Twisted fate, etc...), that way they can't leave lane without losing mid/top early.\n\n4. Finally, after 98% of my games with him, I get the same thing: \"Wow, that shield is BS... Morde is so OP.\" This right here is EXACTLY why he isn't OP. Really, he isn't as safe of a pick as Riven (with two dashing abilities, and two abilities with hard CC), but if you can manage your pushing power+shield, you can win lane easily, even without the health regen buff. \n\nJust remember one tiny, simple tip: after getting spellvamp, when pushing wave or taking raptors: E, THEN Q. I see so many people getting this wrong. If you want to heal more health than you lose, DO NOT USE Q FIRST. E the wave, Q the wave, that's 5 farm and you lost no health.\n\nEDIT: I forgot, if we keep making \"Buff morde\" threads, RIot might, then he won't be my secret weapon anymore, and people might actually know what his abilities do.
