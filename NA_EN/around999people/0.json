Idk about you but most of modern society functions in a way where accepting other world views is accepted. I didn&#039;t realize we were living in a religious state where going outside the mold was wrong. Honestly, why does her being gay matter? If it makes you feel uncomfortable, isn&#039;t it your issue that a fictional character in a free to play game that you freely choose to play on your free time makes you uncomfortable enough to need to force your world view onto others?\n\n&quot;Its not her being gay but how it&#039;s always in my face&quot; she has like what? 3 lines that are openly about her sexuality if even 3. I&#039;ve seen every interaction she has and none of them even made me think she&#039;s any sexuality until I saw the comments. She has a personality. Maybe you don&#039;t like it, but until you actually go and create your own characters in a game you&#039;re stuck with it as it is. \n\n&quot;Nerf!&quot; Ok yes. Her damage is a bit up there, but honestly her kit is ok. Just slightly lower the dmg on her q and she&#039;ll be good to go. Her q is the problem, halfing the hp of any carry early on. Her e is a very very short root and isn&#039;t nearly as bad as something like zyra e. Her w is fine. And her ultimate is something she really risks to line up for best results. Turn on her and melt her before she can set it off and problem solved.","replies":[]}
