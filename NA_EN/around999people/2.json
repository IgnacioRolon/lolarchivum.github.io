Riot, I have played your game since season 2. I have sunk money into the game. I have upheld the code of conduct. Why are you punishing me and as you claim, 99% of the community? By unbanning someone as toxic as him you spit on everyone who follows the rules. What reason do we have now for not trolling? For not breaking the rules. This action is like setting free a serial killer and expecting him to not kill just because he says he won&#039;t. Yes, it&#039;s an extreme example, but then again, this is an extreme case. \r\n\r\nRiot, you have done a number of questionable things before. But this is the first one where I am disgusted to even play the game anymore. You have alienated every player who has followed the rules and you&#039;re saying it&#039;s absolutely fine to break the rules because you&#039;ll not only let it happen but encourage it by letting him back in.","replies":[{"poster":"Timethief49","date":"2018-01-04T21:07:48.415+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Killers do get set free after serving their time. He wont receive any of his accounts back, he will just be able to play without getting instantly banned again. This is the same for every other player. He only got the harder banversion cause he was using the breaking of rules basicly as his trademark.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2018-01-04T21:00:55.263+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"? i don't see why you're upset when he would have been playing the game regardless and the only reason you knew he was playing was because he either streamed or made a video about it.\n\n\nSo what's the difference considering he even said himself he plays offstream/off-video?\n\n\nIs it some self righteous ego-type thing?
