So, why not deal with it harshly?\r\n\r\nMy idea is this:\r\n\r\nWhen someone says a phrase like &quot;kys&quot; they get a debuff. Something like 30% slow for 5 min. Or 30% less dmg. If they do it again they get another debuff and so on. If they get to the point where stats are 99% gone then they get a ban when game is over.
