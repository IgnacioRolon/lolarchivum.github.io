You can't and the names aren't even displayed right now, nor the profile pics are getting displayed, you want to make a lobby for any queue? You can't invite everyone cause apparently that one friend of yours who wants to join the lobby and play a match with you is in a nonexistent match. \r\n\r\nYou want to ban a champion on ranked champ select? Try it, you won't be able to because the client will freeze out of nowhere for no reason and you'll have to lose 3 lp then 5 then 10 because it decided to freeze 3 times in a row.\r\n\r\nYou want to see your match history? Good luck with the eternal loading screen\r\nYour profile? Pray to god your able to lol\r\nWant to open your hex tech crafting chests or capsules you just got last match? Hope that luck is on your side because either it loads or it never loads up.\r\n\r\nAs soon as you open this ugly terrible client that can barely launch your mood to play is completely crushed, seriously, every single time I want to play league now I open the client then I just close it because apparently I have to wait a while for it to load the play button.\r\n\r\nAnd im sure theres been way more issues over the last 2 weeks and theres comments about it everywhere; Twitter, Reddit, Even the newest league cinematic, its just so pathetic that a company with this much money has 0 standards for quality when it comes to its main product which is the game. \r\n\r\nNice way to start the 10 year anniversary riot, a wonderful  service to your players!!!","replies":[{"poster":"e46 Fanatic","date":"2020-01-10T03:20:19.838+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"the fact that no one is putting Riot under fire for intentionally bugging the game to hell is a meme...\nfor years now we've been getting new bugs coming from patches where that area of the game wasn't even updated... we get bugs with EVERY champ released... there are game breaking bugs that have been lingering for well over 5 years and so much more... \n\nWHEN WILL PEOPLE REALIZE RIOT IS DOING THIS ON PURPOSE... \n\neven if it's not on purpose, coding a video game with only 2 tiny maps IS NOT HARD.
