I got chat restricted for basically saying \"Poor idiot\" which wasn't an insult to any of my teammates everyone was making fun of someone on the enemy team who made a terrible tower dive, and for saying \"Bullshit\" while my rumble, my ad, my jungle and i were complaining about our teemo support briefing our match, i had the support perma sit mid and the jungler hovering topside all game, while my teemo kept giving his best effort to feed as much as possible while making it seem as if we was trying and being passive aggressive towards everyone in our team for calling him out, and since he didn't say any single bad word nor did the act toxic in chat he apparently didn't get punished for griefing our game, the guy plays teemo support first time when he's a support main who plays nautilus, blitzcrank and thresh but apparently I was toxic for calling him out on trolling, I know the best you can do nowadays is not type cause its most likely you getting banned than a troll getting banned, they just need to not be aggressive in chat and its a win for them.\r\n\r\nGame 1\r\nIn-Game\r\nFirepounder: I was pinging the yi\r\nFirepounder: Lol\r\nFirepounder: is it me or is nasus mid lowkey busted?\r\nFirepounder: Wtf\r\nFirepounder: 2 Es half hp\r\nFirepounder: Rubmle\r\nFirepounder: Wanna swap lanes?\r\nFirepounder: Not with yi hovering mid\r\nFirepounder: bard game\r\nFirepounder: yi came 3 times\r\nFirepounder: came\r\nFirepounder: no tp sussy\r\nFirepounder: Poor idiot\r\nFirepounder: wasted smite on me thinking it stops me when its not daamge\r\nFirepounder: lol\r\nFirepounder: Ive seen more bs today teemo\r\nFirepounder: its ok\r\nFirepounder: Just a question\r\nFirepounder: why teemo supp man?\r\nFirepounder: Jhin is a high attackspeed adc?\r\nFirepounder: As far as i can tell he shots 4 shots then reloadsp\r\nFirepounder: So your pick is from 10 to 0 0\r\nFirepounder: Useless against it\r\nFirepounder: and against bard just gets worse\r\nFirepounder: oh and youre feeding yi\r\nFirepounder: so gg\r\nFirepounder: This is the bullshit that has me losing every game\r\nFirepounder: someone picking some troll picks or trolling and not warding at all\r\nFirepounder: You did?\r\nFirepounder: gj\r\nFirepounder: Either trolling or panic picked\r\nFirepounder: you play blitz and naut\r\nFirepounder: why not just pick naut or blitz\r\nFirepounder: really tired of this bulsshit\r\nFirepounder: 8 games\r\nFirepounder: lost\r\nFirepounder: all of them\r\nFirepounder: because someone trolled\r\nFirepounder: i ahve good kdas damages and gold\r\nFirepounder: Mids open\r\nFirepounder: report teemo\r\nFirepounder: Look at my last 10 games\r\nFirepounder: dont ask why\r\nFirepounder: look at my last 10 games\r\nFirepounder: each one of them\r\nFirepounder: lost because someone else decided to grief them\r\nFirepounder: See what i mean?\r\nFirepounder: Its just bullshit\r\nFirepounder: Thats the quality\r\nFirepounder: ive been getting for a while\r\nFirepounder: took a week break\r\nFirepounder: come back\r\nFirepounder: same bs\r\nFirepounder: I totally\r\nFirepounder: see the point\r\nFirepounder: rumble made there\r\nFirepounder: Teemo saying he tires his best despite feeding as much as he can\r\nFirepounder: report teemo for griefing please\r\nFirepounder: Almost feels like he soft tinted\r\n\r\nThe second chat log just gets worse, i wasn't toxic to anyone at all, i barely typed that game, i was playing ahri, everyone locked in they champions on champ select and then we all got into loading screen, i waited more than 10 mins in loading screen, restarted it 4 times, the client closed twice for no reason and i was stuck there for almost the entire match, i reconnected and everyone was flaming me , not only did i not have a reason to reconnect when i was gonna lose lp either way because of a client bug, but i was also gonna get reported and flamed for trying to come back to the game and blamed for something that wasn't my fault at all, i even said how i hated the client because i was stuck in loading screen for almost the entire match. Banning and player behavior system is just so bad, not only does it give you unfair punishments but it doesn't even punish the people that deserve the punishment.. You are facing a duo in your team or enemy team? well careful with what you say cause they might just abuse the system and bait you into typing something and reporting you and you getting punished for it. Someone ints your ranked? Oh just go next, be fine with losing lp in an unfair way and see how the inter just gets way with it with no punishment or consequence for their action.\r\n\r\nNot only has ranked quality dropped so bad, but your player behavior system is a joke just as the client performance and its bug, the client friends list bug has been here for almost a month and it still has no fix. Ranked queue quality is just gonna drop more and more cause riot cares only about selling skins and attracting new players and pro play now, and they don't even care about proplay that much, they care about those brands and deals theyre getting cause it means money, and since they're getting a lot of money nothing is gonna change cause they're being successful by not being successful.\r\nGame 2\r\nIn-Game\r\nFirepounder: Dude\r\nFirepounder: I hate this client\r\nFirepounder: I was stucki n loading screen\r\nFirepounder: up until now\r\nFirepounder: Thanks lol\r\nFirepounder: Why? lol\r\nFirepounder: I lose lp anyways\r\nFirepounder: and im getting reported so\r\nFirepounder: ffs\r\nFirepounder: I got to lose a game because of a client bug\r\nFirepounder: See?\r\nFirepounder: Exactly what im talking about\r\nFirepounder: its like everyone is saying I dcd because i wanted\r\nFirepounder: ok","replies":[{"poster":"NF Remilia","date":"2020-01-26T21:33:24.396+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes you flamed your team , harassing them , score shaming , asking for reports and much more. 100% deserved.

Why exactly? I accept the punishment I deserve it, I may have been toxic sure, but that’s far from a deserving Permaban.

I'd say the two things you should do are submit a support ticket asking if there are any other logs that contributed to your punishment and\n2. Stop typing report XxxxX\n^Never ever type this phrase, it does nothing because multiple reports for a single game don't have greater impact than 1 report according to riot, but typing this in all chat is probably what got you the chat restriction bc it's a sign of toxicity and definitely on the chat bot's no-no list","replies":[]},{"poster":"CV Protostar","date":"2020-01-26T21:59:29.401+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"You should have received an actual ban for this honestly.\n\nFlaming is flaming.
