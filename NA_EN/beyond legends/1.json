They probably know how people change, considering how long they’ve been doing this symbiotic relationship/empowering of theirs. \n\nSometimes people do change like that, but they still remember where they came from and emotions they felt prior. Leona was harsher because she was in command of the Solari’s elite defensive group. You have to be harsh there when facing all sorts of opposition. And I wouldn’t call her bloodthirsty. Zealous, indoctrinated, but not bloodthirsty. She felt a threat from Diana, and after the elders were killed, she rightly pursued her. If you’re entire leadership was slaughtered, would you not seek out the one who killed them to bring them to justice?\n\nAs for the Sun, he probably figured that the compassion was still a part of her, and perhaps on seeing him she remembered. It’s not the first 180 upon meeting a deity we’ve seen like this either, albeit not necessarily in the lore. In our own history, there are many people who did such a thing, the most prominent in my mind is Paul from Biblical times, who went from wanted to kill Christians to becoming one himself after an encounter with the God of the Bible.","replies":[{"poster":"Warlord Dienekes","date":"2017-11-20T14:07:40.560+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here’s the rub, Sun isn’t forgiving and compassionate.

On the contrary the one interaction we know for certain was the Sun’s opinion is it delighting at the thought of setting people on fire.\n\nThen why was she chosen after showing compassion if it wasn‘t something the Sun valued?\n\nThat one interaction is the quote on the summary, yes?\n\n> \"If you would shine like a sun, first you must burn like one.\"\n\nWhy does it make you think the sun delights in setting people on fire? That’s very much taking those words at face value. There is a metaphoric meaning for burning as well: purification, as iron and silver are purified in flames. It’s a burning away of impurity to make something stronger and more beautiful, but it doesn’t mean literally setting people on fire. Usually the fire is passing through suffering or a trial to put you in a place of weakness, and if you come out on the other side, you become stronger for it. That is how I interpret that saying because, clearly, Leona does not get set on fire.","replies":[{"poster":"Warlord Dienekes","date":"2017-11-21T00:27:32.282+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Color text in Leona’s story.

It wants to execute judgement by fire on those that killed innocents and defiled land. That’s a pretty big difference.\n\nThere’s burning to shine, which is more of a purifying, and burning by the fires of judgment..which in this instance are literal flames.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"WOOOOOOOOHOOOOOO","date":"2017-11-20T06:31:53.080+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What’s 10 years to one thousand?","replies":[{"poster":"Warlord Dienekes","date":"2017-11-20T06:40:38.687+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"We have no clue, because we know jack squat about how the space parasites function.\n\nBut if they cannot comprehend how time can change people, when they know how short their lifespans are.

We did research on how long it takes people to climb mountains and consulted a mountain-climber who had scaled Everest multiple times (eight? I think). Our reference informed us that if one didn't stop to camp, the journey itself in raw physical distance would only be a couple days. However, most of the time spent is spent on acclimatizing, setting up camp, going up to higher elevations and then back down again once the body has gotten used to it, and then finally making the push to the top and then quickly coming down again before the lack of oxygen kills the climber. In total, that makes climbing attempts stretch out to many, many weeks just to overcome the physical limitations of the human body.\n\nGiven that Targon is a fair bit bigger than Everest, we thought about the absolute amount of time it would take if the mountain didn't do its stretchy mind-bendy thing, and it would be about three weeks to a month (if we assume the presence of magic and the fact that we have characters in our world that are no mere humans).","replies":[{"poster":"DariusDemiurge","date":"2017-11-20T07:40:01.149+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Whren,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=30aOBIOQ,comment-id=00020001,timestamp=2017-11-20T06:40:44.822+0000)\n>\nSnip\n\nWhile not helpful the first part does not apply to those in league it is interesting none the less.\n\nAnd the second part helpful.
