Either they gonna release it as a start of their office day as the first thing they do when they start (which will ba 9-10 AM I guess, which will be in an hour or two at their HQ I think if I remember timezones correctly). Or they would release it around point 12, because then every Rioter is on lunch break officially and can turn their attention to the boards exploding and share the moment with their community. Also, this allows them to do some last minute checking today before the release.\n\nSo I'd say 2-4 hours.

It'd be pretty bad if you got carpal tunnel from refreshing webpages, if, for example, something like Bloodline didn't turn up for a few days.  Hypothetically speaking.  Also remember to stretch, and that sitting for long periods of time is probably quite bad for you.  Hydrate and stuff too.\n\nThis has been an unprompted health message from someone not on the Narrative team.","replies":[{"poster":"Sharjo","date":"2016-05-27T15:48:39.726+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I always stretch regularly mainly because I can't sit still for very long anyway, so no worries, I'm definetly taking care of myself.
