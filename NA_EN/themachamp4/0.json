We are in this case discussing whether the log provided was punishable in the first place. He doesn't say all punishments should be always the same. He even wrote a proper example and you still missed the point.\n\nA court decides guilt and punishment. First you decide guilt. If a person was banned before, that doesn't mean they are explicitly guilty now. After you deem them guilty, you choose their punishment. Punishment can scale with past punishments. For example, some countries use three times max rule where the third case of you violating the same law guaranteed life-time in prison.","replies":[{"poster":"KennysDreamGirl","date":"2018-02-21T20:12:37.910+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"except that this is a video game and not a court of law. riot has rules and if you break them then that's that","replies":[{"poster":"Yaśuo Main","date":"2018-02-21T20:37:49.756+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"good, then OP shouldn't be beaned rn","replies":[{"poster":"KennysDreamGirl","date":"2018-02-21T20:59:40.822+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"no, if he had chat resstrictions before then he deserves the ban. riot has rules and if you break them you take whatever punishment tier you are in. since he got 2 weeks that means hes had chat restrictions recently. there is no if ands or buts about it","replies":[{"poster":"Yaśuo Main","date":"2018-02-23T21:16:55.290+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"he'd deserve the ban if there was something to get banned for, and there isn't any evidence provided there was. so whats ur point dawg","replies":[{"poster":"KennysDreamGirl","date":"2018-02-23T21:25:36.710+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"read what tantrum has said about the subject","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Anastaecia","date":"2018-02-21T09:44:28.136+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"That looks like a portion of a log.
