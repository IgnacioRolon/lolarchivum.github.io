It's dumb and Riot needs to fix client but, when it freezes and you can't tab out do this.\n\nAlt+tab (you will tab out but client will not minimize)\nPress Ctrl+Alt+Delete (to open task manager, you won't be able to bring it up but it'll be there)\n\nPress Windows key (to pop up task bar)\n\nHover mouse over task manager (dont click it)\n\nTask manager will display so you can read it but if you click it it will disappear, count where league of legends is on the list of running programs\n\nTab to task manager (you'll be doing this blind) and press down arrow the number of times that matches what place league of legends was on the list (E.G. if it was 2nd on list, tap down arrow twice)\n\nHit delete key.

Make sure Task Manager is not running at the moment. You can do this by hitting the windows button and closing it via right click, in case it is open right now.\n\nStep 2. Make sure you are tabbed into the game.\nWhat I mean by that is, when you try to tab out, Windows recognizes it, but League doesn't care. Make sure you hold alt after pressing tab and reassure that you are in the game client, perhaps even with a mouse click.\n\nStep 3: Click the windows key on your keyboard.\n\nStep 4. Press this button next to the search bar:\nhttps://imgur.com/a/b1Iafwi\n\nIt's called \"active apps\" or \"create new desktop\", anything that allows you to \"create a new desktop\" is the right option (should be at the top of the screen after you click that button)\n\nStep 5. Now that you clicked this button, windows will have redirected you to this desktop. Open the Task Manager here.\nAND LET IT LOAD FOR A MOMENT(!)\n\nStep 6. Kill the League of Legends process by either clicking it and pressing \"Kill task\" or something similar on the bottom right,\nor rightclicking it and selecting whatever kills the task in the context menu that shows up.\n\nIMPORTANT: DO NOT CLOSE THE LEAGUE CLIENT (Has the new league Logo, the circular one).\nMAKE SURE YOU CLOSE THE GAME CLIENT (Square, old Logo).\n\nThen Rito games should automatically redirect you to the client prompting you to reconnect. \nIf you notice immediately that your loading screen froze, getting back into the game, with an average PC will take you \n30 secs to a minute instead of getting the remake thrown at you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mouth Stuff","date":"2019-11-10T21:20:08.245+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had this happen last night and I thought it was my computer but clearly it's happening to other people as well","replies":[]},{"poster":"14daysuspensionk","date":"2019-11-10T17:36:36.275+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm just wondering why you kept on getting into games knowing that it might crash.","replies":[{"poster":"KartOMania","date":"2019-11-11T00:11:38.361+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=14daysuspensionk,realm=EUNE,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=XEsiaQ5z,comment-id=0006,timestamp=2019-11-10T17:36:36.275+0000)\n>\n> I'm just wondering why you kept on getting into games knowing that it might crash.\n\nso far they did not disable ranked...","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Twigz91","date":"2019-11-10T17:32:05.345+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"keep doing it to me too mid game it freezes i cant close window then i get afk and no rewards even if i come back and we win. so dumb","replies":[]},{"poster":"urmomcalled","date":"2019-11-10T09:46:53.138+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Literally just happened to me.
