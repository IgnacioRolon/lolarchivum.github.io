We're still currently investigating the issue and locating the root cause. \n\nI was able to successfully load in with the orange Rocket Girl Tristana when creating a custom game. I use the Koi Nami Element chroma pack pretty frequently and I've personally not had issues with them - I always make sure to re-select the chroma I want while in champion select. It's a crappy workaround for now, but it's helped ensure I load in with the chroma I'd like.","replies":[]}]}
