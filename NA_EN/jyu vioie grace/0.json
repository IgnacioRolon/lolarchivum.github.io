In the PBE Client itsaid it was \"Updating\". I waited for about a hour and it seemed like the download was finished but it kept on going. it is currently at 1748.4 MB/1750.0 MB. Also, it says on the bottom left corner ETA -64 MINS. Is this normal or is there something wrong with the client? I have been waiting for quite a while now and the client has yet to stop \"Updating\". I have already sent a support ticket but Riot has yet to reply. Has anyone here had this problem and managed to fix it somehow? Please reply if you \ndo!\n\nI want to test some things out on PBE! {{item:3070}} \n\nEDIT: It has been fixed!
