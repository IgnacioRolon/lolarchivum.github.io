It continues to freeze and crash over and over. I've checked my internet speeds and I am experiencing some drop in speeds due to Holiday peeks hours and everything but not enough to account for the amount of crashes. I've tried to just play some custom games to see if the client will allow that and it crashes and fails to create them and just gives me a pop up saying an unexplained issue has occurred. Now again for the 3rd week I've been dealing with random crashes and client issues, leading to 30 minute bans. Which can I get a reasoning behind your decision to make it a 30 minute ban time?\r\n\r\nThanks for your time, hoping to one day understand. \r\nFutureShamann","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-27T03:14:08.377+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First, I wanted to mention that the 30-min queue timer is added to your account after a *recent trend* of disconnecting occurs. While I cannot remove it, we can work toward resolving this technical issue that's contributing to the disconnections at this point. Since this error is commonly associated with your client dropping its connection to the servers, I'd strongly recommend configuring your local network settings according to our [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues).\n\nPlease let me know if you continue to experience these disconnections *after* taking those steps.","replies":[{"poster":"FutureShamann","date":"2016-12-27T03:37:06.166+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ran the HRT and it says \"everything is ok\"","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-27T21:44:59.401+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How did the rest of the steps in that guide go for you?","replies":[{"poster":"FutureShamann","date":"2016-12-31T08:09:47.876+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My apologies i thought i responded to this days ago. \nThey have been running slightly better.

As I play your game pretty much all day after I get off work baring spending some time with friends and family; and it seems as if you disconnect 1 time it is a 5-6 minute ban time, (which is fair and reasonable I suppose), but then spikes to over or equal to 5x's the wait time on the 2nd disconnect even if its been over 3 hours. What is the deciding factor on the additional 25 minutes of ban time if it happened twice in a 4 hour period, separated by 3 hours. \nDon't get me wrong I fully understand the need for ban times and why they exist. I support a punishment system, but 1/48th of your user's entire day? That seems a tad extreme.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"FutureShamann","date":"2016-12-27T05:04:24.887+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just an update still happening on both the legacy and the alpha.
