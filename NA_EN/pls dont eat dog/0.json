For real Riot, you guys will actually ban someone who spends $100 in a month on your game for being aggro in chat? Really? It's so easy to mute. Is a ban really right? I play this game all the time, investing hours into the game, spending money on the free game, supporting you guys and you ban me for 2 weeks? Seriously? Some kid starts flaming me and I say something back so I get banned? That makes a lot of sense Riot. I'll think twice the next time I buy RP from you guys. That's if it ever crosses my mind. I can't wait for Halo and console to take back over the E-Sports market. Everyone agrees league is going to shit, I can't wait for the next big train to put you guys in the dirt. Hell I can't wait to do it myself when i grow up and have my own game company. I will literally destroy you riot, I promise you. I will destroy you, I'm going make the best game in the world, offer a billion dollar prize pool, and everyone around the world playing league will hop on the bandwagon trying to go pro in my game instead of this trash game. You guys suck eggs and I can't wait to put you 6 ft under.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele II","date":"2019-10-09T05:31:54.670+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lmao damn that got pretty hilarious towards the end.

There are no high horse here but if there was, why would i ? Just because i have better understanding and comprehension of the players behavior and their limited short sighted mind set means i should step down from my observations to cater to their ignorance. If they want advice, i am more than happy to give it to them with the best of my ability  but instead of seeking help, they come to forum to complaint, whine, and cry till they feel better about themselves.","replies":[{"poster":"ChrisBrownze","date":"2019-10-09T14:44:26.093+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"ExcaliburX","date":"2019-10-09T15:13:05.097+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ChrisBrownze,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=xk3HmqQs,comment-id=0002000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2019-10-09T14:44:26.093+0000)\n>\n> Wow your narcissism is cringe.\n\nEveryone has little narcissism in them and i am not that narcissist to the point of being blinded by my own opinions.

The mute feature doesn't absolve you over your responsibility over your behavior.\n\n>Some kid starts flaming me and I say something back so I get banned?
