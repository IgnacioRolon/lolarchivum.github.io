I kicked ass at that game, and I won several local tournaments, until I eventually forced all the competition out of the area. Eventually the competitive scene died off, and I couldn&#039;t find any more big tournaments for it. I have performed my best in that game than I ever have in any other game I&#039;ve played (and I&#039;ve played a lot). I mained Patroklos in that game. Not aPatroklos. Just regular Patroklos. I absolutely loved his fighting style, and JUSTICE theme. I eventually grew to love the concept of Sword and Shield in any other game I played, as well as Justice. I main Pharah in Overwatch. (I mean that game isn&#039;t much for mains, but oh well) I like Garen&#039;s theme in League, but it just doesn&#039;t have the spunk I feel like a Sword and Shield Character would. I desperately wish for a Sword and Shield Character to be in the game. I care a lot about League, and with some things that have happened to me in recent days... It&#039;d be nice to go back to the Sword and Shield I&#039;ve grown to love. \r\n\r\nIf you catch me on the Rift, I&#039;ll probably be playing Support, because I can&#039;t stand the idea of fighting somebody when I&#039;m not \r\n&quot;in form&quot;\r\nI&#039;ve been trying to climb ranked ladders, but it&#039;s pretty hard to have a &quot;carry style&quot; impact on the game without breaking the fantasy idea of &quot;Support&quot; When I play support I imagine playing the caring individual who would sacrifice themselves for their friends, because they&#039;re worth it. I resonate a lot with the Support Role, and I would gladly give everything I could to make my friends lives even just a little bit better. \r\n\r\nBut recently, I&#039;ve come to a Resolution... That I need to be more **BOLD**, and self-defined. I&#039;ve been living the majority of my life concerned with the lives of people around me, that I&#039;ve forgotten to figure out what I need. So as I travel on this quest to define myself, I need a character that I know would set me on the right path... and feel just right.\r\n\r\nWhile we&#039;re on the Topic, if I could have it perfect, I would prefer the character look like:\r\nMale\r\nWhite and Gold Color Sheme\r\nLight Armor\r\nWhite Hair\r\nGray Eyes\r\n**Angel Wings Maybe???**\r\nThe Sword in his right hand, and the Shield in his left.\r\nGive the design of Armor and Weapons, an Athenian look (or greek look)\r\nAnd to have some emote mentioning Justice almost as profoundly as Garen\r\n\r\nThanks for reading this! It would mean the world to me for a Sword and Shield Champ to be released sometime within Season 7, so I can get started up as fast as possible in finding myself.\r\n\r\n{{item:1055}} {{item:3026}} {{item:1054}}  &lt;3","replies":[{"poster":"reaperteaser","date":"2017-02-24T21:48:09.508+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"we just need riot to make link a character","replies":[]},{"poster":"FloRaider42","date":"2017-02-24T21:20:20.024+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Missing Fantasy Role\"\n{{champion:86}}Theme + {{champion:89}}Weapons + {{champion:10}} race","replies":[]}]}
