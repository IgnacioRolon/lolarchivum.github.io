A lot of the theorycraft going on right now  is using a Tear for early game mana, followed by an ER for all around sustain, then building into Manamune/Muramana for good damage. The on-hit effect of Muramana synergizes with the LS on ER. The return mana on autos hits a medium point where mana consumed will balance with mana expended and a REAL and sustainable dps gain will be visible from Muramana's on-hit. Using this build with IGB, TForce, or FH makes a lot of sense.\n\nThis even sounds cool as a build, Manareaver. See?\n\nPLEASE WAIT RIOT. Let's see how it works until the end of the season. You will be suprised at the variety of builds that come up on previously obscure champions. GP, Olaf, and Darius could all benefit from a build like this. It will help them pressure lane and push better. They need that so that they can roam. Push/Roam tactics is what lets you counterplay camping immobile champs top.\n\nSo please, wait at least a few months and let us see how awesome this combo can be. The experimental rework will make a build synergy like this disappear because true dmg doesn't proc LS. The way Manamune builds now is enough of a change.","replies":[{"poster":"ricklessabandon","date":"2014-07-19T04:07:35.314+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"the experimental changes are just thatâ€”i'm just trying to gather data on what kind of actives might work (mostly cast paradigms, how mana costs work with them, etc). at some point muramana's active will be changed (or at least adjusted for balanced), but that time isn't in the immediate future from what we've been seeing.","replies":[{"poster":"Tortferngatr","date":"2014-07-19T04:27:07.158+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since you're here (although this might be a better question for the Statikk AMA, if you could answer it that would be great), I have a question about ER: Why doesn't it have Forbidden Idol in its build path?\n\nIt seems like the CDR and mana sustain components come out of nowhere on Essence Reaver.","replies":[{"poster":"VPXDEj85AY","date":"2014-07-19T04:43:11.338+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree here. Essence Reaver's mana sustain only comes at the very end of the build path, negating it's usefulness a lot because the window for mana issues normally persists in the early to mid game. Giving the few people who would want this item a way to opt into early mana regen instead of being stuck to choose between Life Steal and AD to get their CD and Mana Regen item would greatly benefit the health of this item.\n\nAlso (and this is more of a personal issue than an actual one) it bothers me that both BT and ER have the same exact item path. I think this breaks some sort of unspoken rule for item paths and if it stays this way would set a precedent that shouldn't be broken quite so nonchalantly.","replies":[{"poster":"Orinne","date":"2014-07-19T08:31:31.387+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rather than BF Sword, wouldn't designing a new mid-tier Essence Reaver along the item path be a quick fix to this?\n\nSomething like:\n\nSpirit Scythe\n\n{{item:3114}} + {{item:1036}} +   {{item:1036}} + 530 gold = 1950 gold\n+ 40 AD\n+ 10% CDR\n\nUNIQUE PASSIVE: Your basic attacks restore mana equal to between 2% and 8% of the physical damage dealt, based on your missing mana.\n\n\nThis would change Essence Reaver to\n\nSpirit Scythe (1950g) + Vampiric Scepter (800g) + 650g","replies":[{"poster":"Funster","date":"2014-07-19T14:54:22.302+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really like this idea.

Thank you for replying. I like that the on-hit can benefit from lifesteal. Without meaningful AD-only-spellvamp, lifesteal is an important tool on AD mages. Having Muramana's on-hit work with it let's you itemize around mana in interesting ways.\n\nFurthermore, breaking down the build path of ER into more sensible pieces would make a build like this even more interesting. I would like to be able to decide if ER or Manamune would be more beneficial to complete early depending on a situation as much as just which one is stronger for dps(a situation where stacking faster is better because I don't need the added sustain as much, for example).\n\nThe on-hit as true dmg is interesting too though(On-hit Yi anyone?). Whatever happens, I'm sure the end result will be fun. I know it's hard to have a lot of build variance in a game like this, but I really enjoy builds and theory crafting as much as actually playing the game.\n\nIf you have time for another quickie, is there any talk of reworking Atma? A few people have suggested a CDR path instead of a crit path in the recipe. I think that would open it up to a lot more champions. Currently it's only really useful on Olaf(w/TriF) or Garren(w/YGB or SS). This change would leave it as viable on those two champs while opening up better bruiser builds for a lot of others. If the AD passive remains the same, it's possible that this wouldn't bring back the metagolem. I could see this as problematic with SotAG though.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"matrii thana","date":"2014-07-19T08:03:17.422+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"what balance problems are there currently? is it above or below expected value? there has been little to no commentary on it in both in the items section nor general discussion except to defend its continued existence. if it's not an immediate future, is there any chance that changes will be marginalized permanently?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Flying Buntcake","date":"2014-07-19T04:26:28.390+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Wow people like ashe could really benefit from this build.
