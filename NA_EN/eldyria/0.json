EU West","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":15,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, I am unable to connect to the Authenticating server after the small patch that hit today, May 11 2017, around 7:25PM GMT+2, after being able to play perfectly fine the day before.\n\nThe first time I tried to login today I got into the game client, I sent my friend a message using the in client chat and I clicked Play to enter a game, but the client was none responsive and then I got the lost connection screen, trying to reconnect etc.  But it never reconnected me so I closed the client and now I'm stuck at said problem.\n\nI read through the support things on possible fixes but none of them seem to work and I think it might be a ISP issue like I saw people using Frontier.\nMy firewall settings or modem settings have not changed since yesterday, all I did was accept the firewall to let LoL Client out on the net after the update happened, which it asks each time a game client has been updated.\nI am playing on EU West from Norway with the ISP   Telenor, if that helps anything at all.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-11T20:25:36.712+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey guys, I've posted a [pinned thread](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/8YYAt5md-eu-regions-login-chat-issues-may-11) to get some more visibility.
