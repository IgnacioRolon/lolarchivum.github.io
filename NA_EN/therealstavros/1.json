I have spent and been gifted **A LOT** of money on this account. Since I am rarely using this account anymore, I really would love to transfer my champions and skins to my friend. I would be horribly sad knowing that LOTS of money and time I've spent on this game would to be to waste. So is there a way I can transfer it? _Maybe confiscate or take away my champions and skins on this account and then have it gifted to my friends account?_ \r\n\r\nFriends Summoner Name: **Orack1**\r\n\r\nI understand if you can't do it due to Code of Conduct and such, but please, I beg of you to do me this one last favor, in repay for all the time and money I've put in this game.\r\n\r\nThanks - TheRealStavros\r\n\r\nHave a good day","replies":[{"poster":"TheRealStavros","date":"2016-09-18T22:39:39.497+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would be hugely gratefull if I could get an answer.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-19T23:02:28.060+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately, this is something we cannot do.
