WARNING: This is more boring than my usual videos. This was created as the beginning of an effort to get law authorities to examine this practice. Feel free to contact me about this topic.","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUAX0gnZ3Nw","image":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tUAX0gnZ3Nw/hqdefault.jpg"},"up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"If anyone has watched this video, you will notice that League of legends is a game that now only provides a service. As much as you want to deny this, the fact stands: \"You can't play league of legends as a game if they don't broadcast their servers.\" (Unless you own their CD of course, which was severely limited and no longer viable for purchase or play due to updates). \n\nOn that note, I would like to ask League of Legends for a legal emulation copy of their servers (including for the old client) so that one day it can be revived once League of Legends decides the game is no longer making reasonable profit and choses to shut down. That way, those who still enjoy your game can completely experience it without you guys being forced to broadcast your server. Yes I am serious and yes, I've paid enough time and money to technically own myself a copy of this game- at least a server emulation (as if it were a Blu-ray disk) as physical property and eventhough absolutely nothing within league of legends (like champion skins) has any monetary value (claimed by your Terms for Services and EULLA)- I still paid the price to own a vital part which would ultimately remove the game as a whole League of legends choose to no longer broadcast their servers. -Yes, it is just the emulated server so piecing it together isn't a pain in the butt.","replies":[]}
