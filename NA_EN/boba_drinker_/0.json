I like your cheese tactic.\n\nMine for Morde is Gunblade Rageblade with exaust and ignite. You can't be 1 vs 1ed and can barely be ganked. You have enough AD to melt towers, burst with Q, hit hard with e, and enough AP for fat heals and a nice burn on your ult. With Rageblade stacking, your Q is similar to the post rework Q in how it keeps getting stronger, as well as your heals in sustained fights.\n\nMy typical 3rd item with that core is Triforce or Ludens, for the MS so I can stick. Triforce is more safe because of the all around stats and Sheen resonance with the AD, but Ludens is a sustain powerspike.","replies":[{"poster":"Selegun","date":"2017-09-15T17:11:25.214+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I stumbled on your post describing that build.

The tone may have changed however since last I saw it was 2 or so days back.  \n\nDon't get me wrong, I love the feel of gunblade whenever I do buy it but feel it's only a solid pick up when I can build lots and lots of resistances.  Things like frozen heart and stoneplate are must haves for getting the most out of gunblade.\n\nPersonal preference is rageblade into titanic hydra while weaving in some extra resists and code.

Rageblade is very strong on Morde IF you can stick, so throw mobility in your build, and use exaust over flash.

With rageblade and titanic, AA three times, start your Q to reset the AA and on the last swing trigger titanic.
