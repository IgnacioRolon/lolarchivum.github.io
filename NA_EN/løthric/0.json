The Q was the only real damage buff.\n\nI wish people would stop acting like she was immensely buffed or something.","replies":[{"poster":"Master of EVIL90","date":"2015-10-18T17:30:32.155+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"almost all AP items got buffed that patch, indirectly buffing _all_ mages in the entirety of League as a whole (yes, even Yorick)","replies":[{"poster":"Stephenizgod","date":"2015-10-18T17:33:34.240+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yorick scales better off of AD though.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Ninavi","date":"2015-10-18T10:00:11.503+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually her buffs made her  lane more effectively.

She still needs 3 items if not more to  clear a whole minion wave. It's ridicilous that she can't kill caster minions with one full maxed E. cough cough Viktor, Velkoz, Ziggs, Anivia, Azir, Xerath.\n\nI agree she was always strong, the reason why her winrate went up is also because more people picked her up aswell. 56 % doesn't mean a champion is unbalanced, some are balanced at 48%, some at 50% and some at 55%.\n\nI don't mind the nerfs but I really want to see what balance team will do, cause sometimes their  choices are well questionable.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sir Yamazuki","date":"2015-10-18T05:13:55.803+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":4,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Chuck Charles,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Lylcz2ce,comment-id=0000000000010000,timestamp=2015-10-18T02:50:34.025+0000)\n>\n> please don't nerf Lux, she is finally viable, but not insanely overpowered.
