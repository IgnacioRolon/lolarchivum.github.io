Are you on the updated client?  Is it showing up as clear boxes?  This may a syncing issue while on the updated client, so switch back to the legacy version and back to get that fixed up.\n\n-  On the login screen of the open beta updated client, look for the \"Launch Legacy Client\" text at the bottom.\n-  Or create a shortcut directly to the legacy client in your League Installation. Just look for \"lol.launcher\"\n\nLet me know if that works for you!","replies":[]},{"poster":"JustADisgrace","date":"2017-03-14T17:36:54.036+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It was just a bug guys restarted LOL (New launcher) and it got back to normal","replies":[]}]}
