And then just one day i decided to check some windows 10 update and update the system. After updating I found out that the fps is becoming lower than before but the most important thing is that no matter what graphic settings I set, very high or very low, the fps always stays the same, which never happened before. And many times when there's an auto animation or something else like using abilities, the fps will have a sudden drop and make u feels like u just lagged and usually the fps will turn to 40-50 for a sec at that time, also it start lagging during team fight now which never happened before. I used anti-virus app and also checked my hard-drive status using Lenovo Solution center and everything is fine. Also my driver is up to date. My computer specs are below:\r\nIntel Core i3-3110m 2.40 GHz\r\n8.00 GB Ram(7.82GB usable)\r\nNvidia Geforce GT 740m\r\nIntel HD Graphics 4000\r\nAlso I used the Gt 740m to run the game\r\nAny suggestions on how to fix this problem? It's bugging me for a while and it feels really bad when you just constantly get fps drop.{{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"The 1 above All","date":"2017-11-01T23:22:33.734+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good news!
