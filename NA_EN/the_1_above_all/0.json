I've heard it may have been caused by the bugs, issues and compatibility of win10 system and nvidia drivers or even the game itself. Does anyone else have been experiencing this problem since some changes in the new settings of the creaters update system doesn't totally solve the problem. And does anyone know If Microsoft, Nvidia, or Riot is working on a fix?","replies":[{"poster":"Vaeyz","date":"2018-01-10T19:00:35.288+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have the same Problem because of this damn Win10 Update.\nI am normally playing with 300 fps and now it drops to 10 etc screen freezing and so on.\nI found a \"fix\" for this you need to go to the league of legends.exer rightclick go to compatiblity and choose Win XP Service Pack 3.\nThis will limit your FPS to 120~ but the drops etc will go away.\n\nI think this is only a temp fix because how is it even possible that a fucking windoes update breaks so many games -.- and we need to start it as it would be windows XP LOL","replies":[]},{"poster":"1eb1anc","date":"2018-01-06T21:13:32.199+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same.
