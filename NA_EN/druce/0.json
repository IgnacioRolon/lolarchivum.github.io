I think that Jayce goes really well into Gnar/Shen/GP which makes him really good. \n\n>Jungle: Evelynn won't make it at world, too easy to counter.Graves to A, Rek and Grag to S like they have always been.\n\nWe saw Eve in the SKT vs TSM scrim leaks, the ultimate changes and the lane swap changes helped her a lot. The nerfs to Rek and Gragas hurt them a lot, Rek'sai is going to have a harder time keeping up with everyone. Gragas is much easier to react to with the cask changes. Graves does well into Elise who I believe will be the top jungler at worlds which is why I think he will do well.\n\n>Mid: Jayce removed.Don't know why you love him so much hahaha.Rest seems pretty legit.\nI moved him down to A I still think he is a legit pick, but probably not on Vlad tier.\n\n>ADC:Lucian down to A, Ashe probably up to S and caitlyn not in it.Could add Tristana to A though depending on the team comp they are running.\n\nThe Ashe nerfs are actually pretty big imo. Lucian will be a strong pick into Sivir. Trist, MF and Twitch are all breaking on A tier and its tempting to put them there, but I don't think they will make the cut. I think they will see a few games though. \n\n>Support: Seems pretty legit, i doubt we'll see thresh and nami though.Maybe once or twice but probably not more than that.\n\nIf I could make a B++ tier, Thresh would be on it.","replies":[{"poster":"Takito","date":"2016-09-13T00:26:53.666+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even with nerfs, shen just have so much global presence and everything that he must be S tier.For jayce i don't know if you saw him in scrims or anything (that will go for eve too) but scrims are scrims.Splyce played sion support very often in scrims during regular season and ended up playing him only in the last game since victory or defeat had no impact on current standings.\n\nFor Adc i'll trust you, i haven't been following the nerfs and buffs much.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"LKV2","date":"2016-09-12T15:23:58.805+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"What?
