A big part of that is that a rare stun scenario didn&#039;t really trade in enough power for the loss of a point and click on his bombs. Making the priority system work better would definitely be a good start, but I feel like our time wizard might need something more.\n\nOne of the changes in his rework made it so his W no longer interacts with his ult, so now it&#039;s kind of a weird move that does nothing but make his bombs and speed buff/debuff usable twice in a row early game, and usuable every 4 seconds instead of whatever the cooldowns are on Q and E late game. The move just feels... archaic, like some better idea probably should have come along and replaced it long ago (and his Q put on an ammo system). It doesn&#039;t even have to be a whole new move, it could still be an interactive ability with the rest of his kit, just a little less simple and boring, a shield on an ally with a bomb, an increase in explosion radius on an enemy with a bomb, tenacity on a speeded unit, attack speed debuff on slowed unit for example.\n\nI dunno, maybe I&#039;m just talking out my ass.","replies":[{"poster":"Daedalus871","date":"2015-04-06T04:49:46.632+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"He needs a real passive too.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kitten of Evil","date":"2015-04-05T23:54:29.083+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been saying this ever since the change. His W is effectively a wasted spot that ONLY exists to use Q twice. It's the only move I can think of in the entire game that only empowers one other move -- most other empower moves affect two or three other moves (Karma ult, Heimer ult, Zyra W affects her Q and E), or passively empower auto-attacks (Twisted Fate's E, Vayne's W).\n\nGive him a real W please Rito!","replies":[{"poster":"YvieZileanOddly","date":"2015-04-06T17:31:56.522+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually his w helps his speed and slow as well for better get aways/catches.\n\nJust saying.\n\nAlso I don't mind the w but please give him a real passive. They nerfed his passive from global and didn't compensate it at all. Honestly he might as well not have a passive at this point, it's that bad.

Maybe make his W like a weaker version of his ult that he could use to win trades. His W could make a small portion of his health bar change color (green -> orange idk) and after a short period if any of that health had been lost it would be restored.
