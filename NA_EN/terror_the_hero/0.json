In order to get it to update I would have to wait around 1 to 2 hours, re-log in to League of Legends and go back to the store. This is not a glitch making it so I can buy stuff and I will not lose IP because if I go to buy something else it will say I do not have enough IP. This meaning the game actually updates your IP but the text on the screen does not update with it. \r\n\r\nIn order to recreate this issue(for me) you just have to buy something from the store with IP and you will notice that it does not show any change in amount of IP.\r\n\r\nThis issue has happened to me for at least the past month every time I buy something with IP.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if this has happened to anyone else as I have not asked, but at least for me it does. I know this is only a small bug, but I felt it should be reported.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-18T15:53:25.021+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your account was having trouble syncing, so it ends up getting a visual issue where your balance isn't updating.  Usually, you can fix this by going into the store and attempting to purchase an item.  You don't need to actually buy something, but it should help force a sync of your balance.  If that doesn't work, you can also try re-logging.  Just in case anyway, I poked your account and gave it a cup of coffee so it should hopefully be updated now!\n\nBoop!\nhttps://media.giphy.com/media/Cpc3SBBJgxJhm/giphy.gif","replies":[]}]}
