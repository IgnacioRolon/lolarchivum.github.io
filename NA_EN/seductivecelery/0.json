What&#039;s repulsive about this is that he didn&#039;t get punished as he still played several games after the one I played with him was over.\r\n\r\nAs of now, the IFS has a list of words that are blacklisted, and if said twice, provoke AT LEAST an instant 14 day ban. The fact that someone can get away with hate speech by just adding an additional vowel is discouraging of the already diminishing trust I put in this system. Maybe try adding a few variations to the blacklisted term list, people shouldn&#039;t be getting away with this.\r\n\r\nIdk, any downsides to this idea?","replies":[{"poster":"Jo0o","date":"2018-03-06T01:17:04.721+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm confused where you're getting these assumptions from. \n\nThere's no \"twice\": You use hate speech, you're toast. And various spelling permutations don't dodge the system. Adding an extra letter here and there won't save you. \n\nFor whatever reason, the system occasionally misses punishments on individuals who cross this line, but that in no way should suggest that it's safe to say stuff like that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-03-06T01:10:15.037+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> As of now, the IFS has a list of words that are blacklisted, and if said twice, provoke AT LEAST an instant 14 day ban.\n\nActually not correct at all.\n\nUnless it is very extreme, several repeat games will get someone a chat restriction. You also get no notification of the punishment unless it happened right after your report.\n\nThe system can very definitely detect people adding letters and all the user tricks, in fact adding letters to the end typically wont even register.","replies":[]}]}
