In quite a few games I&#039;ve been autofilled I resolve them with players in the chat that had my role as their second and theirs as my second... And while riot does claim that it helps queue time (I don&#039;t doubt it either) being autofilled an unfamiliar role typically leads to a loss or a dodge, both of which are more problematic then waiting a tad longer. So how much time does auto fill save and do you like League with it or without?","replies":[{"poster":"Taeseuk","date":"2017-11-22T07:11:15.777+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The major issue is when you get to higher ranks and there are less players at master/challenger level the wait time is already around 6-10 minutes and roles that aren't always picked such as support take a long time to fill if you do not have autofill on. \n\nIt sucks that you get autofilled sure and most times you get to sort it out in champ select but if it wasn't there the wait times would be double of what they are now and people would be complaining like crazy.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-11-22T06:44:32.141+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yes and no.\n\nHere's the reasoning for them having autofill in the first place.\n\n\nbefore autofill was a think, people got pretty upset about queue times,\n\nex being diamond 1 and up had to experience around 20-60 minute queues on average.\n\n\nThis complaining continued for a while then riot added a secret ingredient to the mix...Chemic-.... autofill.","replies":[]}]}
