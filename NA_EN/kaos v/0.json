My Summoner name is Genesis RM. I want to create a ranked team in order to grow as a player and with out people. Just to provide some brief background information. I am an ex-competitive player for Gears of War 3 (Xbox 360). I have been playing league ever since I retired a few years back. I have been playing for about 3 years now. I reached Gold 4 last season after the rewards were given out already. I am currently in Silver III (98 LP). I main top lane and generally play a variation of different top laners based upon the team that I have. I am currently looking for all positions except top. In addition, I would also like to pick up a coach if possible. I ask that if you decide to apply/ play with the team that you have a serious attitude when playing but also holding up a positive and fun environment. The purpose of the team is to create a place where a group of people can learn the game and get better together. Please fill out the application and allow me time to get back to you. There will be scheduled practices however, they may change to fit player schedules or in case of unanticipated events that may occur.  Looking forward to teaming with some of you.  Please complete the application below before adding me.

I am a mid main however i can flex into adc or support. My preferred role is coach/analyst. I have experience in high level competitive gaming, notably in Halo 3. I have coached and analyzed for Halo 3 and Reach. I have been playing League for the better part of 2.5 years now and have reached the ranking of gold 5. Even though my ranking is nothing special I feel that I have a very high level of understanding of the game and can give insights into the game that most would not think of. I put in roughly 40hrs a week into watching streamers, lcs, and other sources of information. It is hard to truly give an accurate estimate of my knowledge and ability off of my previous games and this post. I would be more than happy to talk on skype, teamspeak, or any other program like that. I live in Pacific time zone and i am not currently going to school. I cannot give an accurate time of availability as of now due to the fact that i am in the middle of a hiring process for a job. It will be only part time so i should be available most days. I am 20 years of age and will be turning 21 in a month. My main strengths in league is my knowledge and my base mechanics. I also have the ability to read a game and analyze it thoroughly. my main weakness is in game experience due to my low number of pvp games played. However i have a win rate above 80% in normals and i won over 90% of my games when getting to gold 5 this year so i feel that this more than makes up for my inexperience against real players. My main goals for the team would be for me to impart as much knowledge as possible and to find some good teammates to play with. Feel free to contact me on league if you wish to know anything else. I am looking forward to your response.","replies":[{"poster":"Dun204","date":"2015-04-21T19:22:46.062+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I forgot to mention that my main champs i play are as follows: {{champion:268}} {{champion:103}} {{champion:51}} {{champion:134}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:15}} {{champion:61}} {{champion:412}} {{champion:37}} {{champion:201}} {{champion:1}} {{champion:40}} \nThese are in no particular order","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Juno3452","date":"2015-04-21T19:17:52.444+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Name (Real): Po\nIGN: Juno3452\nTime Zone: Central\nAge: 26\nEducation/ Occupation (for availability reasons): Work from 7-6\nDays Unavailable: Friday, Sat, Sun, unless asked before so I can re-arrange that\nRole: ADC\nCurrent Rank: Still in provisions for Solo Q.\nS4 Rank: Solo Q - Gold 2, Teams - Plat 3\nFavorite Champions: Lucian, Jinx, Corki\nStrengths: Positioning, Shot calling, Team fights\nWeaknesses: Laning phase depending on the opponent and support. \nGoals you hope to accomplish by being on this team: Have fun and improve.
