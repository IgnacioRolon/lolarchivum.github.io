I get stuck inside the lobby. I can't leave the lobby and everything is not updated like friends list and I can't see new messages and I can't start the game. If it's my friends lobby and he starts the game my screen will pop up but it will still be stuck like he never started the queue and I don't even know if the other person started the que or not because i'm stuck it just pops up when queue appears and nothing happens. I also get the bug where after every game it takes years to load stats and it won't load anyways so i have to re-log which a god damn pain. The only way I can get by without re-logging is by toggling the close client during the game which is also a pain since it takes so long to load.  Another bug that I found while writing this is with the replay system. First one that has been there for a long time that I don't feel like touching are recording replays. The replays always has a weird static noise that plays during the replay which needs to be fixed it destroys my eardrums because they're so loud i swear i'd go deaf. Not sure why i'm only saying it after talking about the least hectic bugs I get. Then after I leave the replay on the client. I can't even make a lobby. Unbelievable. I find bugs one after another. And lastly I have played league for about a good 4 years and never have I ever had problems with my lock screen until last year. Every time a new game starts my camera ALWAYS starts locked. You may think well just press y. Why do I have to press Y every game. I don't understand why it won't just stay unlocked. I have looked up this before and it says change a game file to like the lock screen line 1 or something and that and that never worked considering the post was from like 2013 probably wouldn't have been much of a help. Also an error message pops up on my screen every time I turn on my computer. And it is specifically coming from league client. I can't remember on the top of my head what it said since I barely turn off my computer. I think it looked like an regular error message you would get form windows but the icon on the bottom was for sure league it said command line error or something like that when I press ok it would just go away. I have gotten many other bugs like  when I do get into end of game score screen after waiting like 20 seconds for the client to reopen and load, I can get  stuck inside end of game lobby and the exact same circumstances would appear as if I was in a lobby as mentioned before. Not sure why I get so many bugs but I have tried repairing the client many times but nothing changes. I also know the lock screen bug only happens on my account. When my friends log in on my computer their screen never starts locked. To add on the the lock screen bug before I tried fixing it what would happen is the game would start my camera would be unlocked until like 20 seconds anytime before that my camera would be unlocked. Then as soon as I hit 20 seconds it will lock no matter what. It also appeared to me that if I were to even click space bar even once before the 20 second mark it would auto lock the camera and then I would have to reach all the way out and press the Y key again. After looking through settings I clicked restore default settings and looked at every little setting I have found nothing wrong with any of my settings that could be causing this. Also after I redid my key binding my games would just straight up start locked. It wouldn't lock itself at 20 the second mark . Just straight up locked.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-25T23:04:24.839+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeesh! I'm sorry you've been running into so many different issues lately. We'll need to troubleshoot these differently so be sure to go through each of these steps.\n\nGetting stuck in the game lobby might be happening if your network loses its link with the server you were going to be playing on. I'd would suggest possibly using a hardwired connection, or checking up on some of your [**network settings**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to see if there's anything you might be able to update. \n\nFor the client taking forever to load back up after games, you should be able to see those after match lobby's if you turn off a specific option. Check out your client options, and make sure **close client during game is turned off**.\n\nThat screeching noise you're hearing during replays is a pretty interesting issue. For some reason, if you fast-forward in the replay before or during the recording process it can cause that hectic noise. Try making those replays without fast-forwarding and let me know if that helps.\n\nLast but not least, your camera starting out locked. It sounds like your configuration files are always reverting to having that camera locked. You can unlock it by pressing Y, but let's make sure to change that option in your game settings. Open the settings in a practice game and change the camera option off of locked. If it still won't save correctly, let me know and we can try a few different things to get that to save correctly.","replies":[{"poster":"CIg DoubIeIift","date":"2017-05-26T03:50:57.992+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1.I have been using a hardwired connection and check everything is up to date. \n2.

I did try clicking the camera lock icon next to the mini map but that didn't solve it either.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-26T04:06:36.516+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For those network issues, go ahead and hit up our tech guys in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).

Turning it back **off** will make the client stay open during the game so you don't have to wait for it to load back up. Do me a favor and try disabling that option and see how much faster you get back into the after match lobby.\n\nI've also included a picture of where you can find that camera setting too. You'll want to hit the gear icon in the upper right of the client to find this options window first!\n\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/d601c3f913d97054465e6e3d6b672c9f.png","replies":[{"poster":"CIg DoubIeIift","date":"2017-05-26T05:12:49.408+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was going to try it out by trying close client option and not. First I ended a practice game with close client during game  and then turning it off but now I can't even leave the stat screen it was also under a lesser time frame then my lobby situation. That aside, it appears finishing practice tool allowed me to enter the end of game stat page with no problem and very smoothly. But just a few days ago I playd a rank game and  it would not let me into the page for at least 3 minutes before closing the client to relog. \n[](https://gyazo.com/f34a0d0a83b419606123f19bc377a5f5)\n\nJust tried it a second  with close client during game offtime this time it's stuck in game is  still in progress.[](https://gyazo.com/a6144d04af67ac8b2b36cfc9372bd45b)\n\nI have also tried each Camera Setting in the picture all of them did not affect whether my camera would start the game unlocked. It actually starts unlocked but pressing space bar would lock it and would be indicated on the camera lock icon by the mini map. \n\nI just tested it again and it seems it stays unlocked for probably the whole game until I press space bar for the first time which is to center the camera but I have checked and it has no key binding to lock the camera. If it did it would lock again at any other part of the game but my camera seems to only lock after the first space bar press","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
