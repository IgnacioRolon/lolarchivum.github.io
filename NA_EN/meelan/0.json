I have a postulant","subforum":"Story, Art, & Sound","up_votes":37,"down_votes":3,"body":"28th last month was the anniversary of **Karma&rsquo;s Rework** and looking back I&rsquo;d like to point out what I think hasn&rsquo;t been addressed properly with her **This thread isn&rsquo;t about her gameplay**, it&rsquo;s about the** rework concept** and what hasn&rsquo;t been delivered. I&rsquo;ve had my fair share of time trying to be clear and bring a strong, interesting point to the table. Hope you find it disputable at the very least.\n \n In general, her abilities feel **uninspired**. She&rsquo;s supposed to bring **a new kind of magic** to the table channeling her **inner flame**. Every other champion has a distinct **element** or **concept** attached to them. **Lux** has** light;** **Brand** has **fire**; **Ryze** has **runes**. One of the most noticeable exceptions is **Karma**. It feels like she fights with **colors**, thus her power is **not well defined**.\n\n* ** Karma&rsquo;s weapon**: Karma&rsquo;s **fans were removed** because they didn&rsquo;t fit her theme anymore. This is true, but **that doesn&rsquo;t mean Riot meant to leave her without a weapon**. As you can see in her [theme concept](http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/attachment.php?attachmentid=746772), her passive ability and **Mantle of Decorum**, she was meant to be the **wielder of the Twin Dragons**, one in each hand, overflowing with **Spiritual Fire**. This is still shown in her [splash art](http://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/img/champion/splash/Karma_0.jpg) . It makes her look more powerful, but in-game this idea is not very clear.\n\n* **Shield**: She has no animations for her E. She just stands still, no matter how you cast it. Riot reworked her and left her with **no animation for her Shield**. This is highly relevant because **I found this video** made by Skinspotlight in SurrenderAt20 when **Riot** added the fans on her PBE model. This video **also shows her shield animation** along with her dance, but it was **never released live**. I also don&rsquo;t know if she could cast it while running as is the case with champions like Janna or Lulu because I couldn&rsquo;t find more footage on that.\n\n[KARMA SHIELD ON PBE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZ_luD0oPXo&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=46s)\n[KARMA SHIELD ON LIVE](https://youtu.be/jL-n8PwXl48?t=1m8s)\n\n* **Mantra&rsquo;d Q**: **The Twin Dragons** channeling forward would have been better fitting, as it&rsquo;d made more sense than just a kame-hame-ha.\n\n* **No running animation on a champion that is constantly hasting itself**: Not all champions have one but it seems logic to me that a champion that **praises herself for catching people up** would have an animation to go with. Champions like Heimerdinger, Tristana, and Sejuani (the next rework after Karma) have haste run-animations and **they don&rsquo;t use them** all that often (besides Homeguard).\n\n* No special interactions: This is not because she doesn&rsquo;t interact in her lore with anyone, as **the leader of the Ionian people** she would most likely have some words to say to a lot of champions. **Syndra** or **Varus** would&rsquo;ve been interesting cases. **(Trundle and Sejuani, a month away, do have special interactions).**\n\n* **Karma Dance**: Most of you probably haven&rsquo;t noticed **her dance. It&rsquo;s Shen&rsquo;s dance**, a Tai Chi form. But the thing that grinds my gears is that **it&rsquo;s just half of Shen&rsquo;s dance**. It does fit her concept but it&rsquo;s boring and **uninspired**. She **could&rsquo;ve meditated sitting down or anything** but this is what they went for.\n[SHEN&#039;S DANCE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FonpXCyU5mc)\n[KARMA&#039;S DANCE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxk6eB8JYUE&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=14s)\n\n_Another thing that isn&#039;t as important for a whole point was her **mantra** which can also be considered unfinished. You see, her mantra is spoken in an ancient Ionian dialect, and it&#039;s supposed to be finished depending on which ability you choose to **finish a sentence**. But it was left unfinished._\n[Mantras](http://i.imgur.com/pVQVZtT.png)\n[Video](https://youtu.be/6yrtZMZiZV0?t=59s)\n_This didn&#039;t bring much to the flavor of the champ so I think they decided actively to leave  it unfinished_. \nEdit: They did respond to this 5 months ago. http://i.imgur.com/lMWT7yZ.png\n**But Why?**\n\nThere are three main reasons why Karma ended up in that unfinished state.\n\n* **Karma was leaked**: Her being **leaked** while being unfinished **probably took it&rsquo;s tool** in what they ended up delivering. They had to **rush and show her** in PBE as the **surprise was spoiled**.\n\n* **They did and didn&rsquo;t think about the fans**: When she was released on PBE, most fans were unhappy because  she had **lost her fans** and **her dress**. Riot didn&rsquo;t thought those elements were iconic to the champion and by that time they had another concept about &ldquo;Full Relaunches&rdquo;. With the problems they had with Karma they learned that they should survey a little more about what fans thought was core to a champion. Anyway, **Riot did listen to the players** and **added her fans and a last minute dress** in her old skins to please them. The **downside** of this is that they pretty much **didn&rsquo;t have time to add or change anything else** thus she was and still is unfinished in some areas.\n\n* **Freljord Event and Howling Abyss were to be released in a month**: Freljord brought along **full relaunch reworks**. I think there probably were some ideas floating around and this was known by Riot but **they had to give us something quick and take time for Sejuani and Trundle**, so Karma ended up **good**, but **not polished**.\n\n\nMy hopes are that she will at the very least get some visual effects when the support balance comes, in a level similar to Caitlyn&rsquo;s Q animation, especially her animation when running. To me, her unfinished design is what makes it hard to make or think cool concept skins for. I love her and think of her as a really fun champion.\n\nBut what do you guys think after reading this? I&#039;m not saying reworks are bad or anything but we had to choose the worst full relaunch thematically wich would it be? Do you agree or disagree with my points?\n\n**Edit**: _As of now Karma has an animation on her passive and it's very pretty. A dragon (or flower on her OoLotus skin) spinning down her body.  The problem is that due to the angle of the camera on the game it just not visible._\n\n_What would be better: Having the dragon spinning inside her Mantle of decorum, since it's always visible, and a sonorous cue._ _If it's visible it would add to the gameplay( maybe even going faster the closer to be off cooldown it is?idk) If you're playing as her you would wonder what is that thing that appears when she hits a champion, if you're the enemy you also would wonder and know that it isn't a good thing.) If you get hit by her you can understand better why she has the mantra more often, and seen more rewarding for hitting everything like \"Hey I won because I made the dragon spin so often with basic attacks :D\"._\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2016-04-02T20:07:00.784+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":0,"body":"But what is {{champion:43}}'s thematic?\n\nHer lore is old (based on the wiki) but it can still stand without the IoW.  Based on this lore, she seems to be trying to find a balance between Ionia's path and present in the hopes for a better future.  When her elders were killed by the Noxian general (rather foolishly) she utilized her magic to do harm for the first time in her life.  She's not only saved her village, but altered something so sacred to do so.  She put the lives of others over the steadfast traditions she had been taught since childhood.  \n\nI see her as this woman who sees that change is necessary, but she doesn't want to outright force people to change.  She wants to guide them in the hopes that a third path will be found. ** Ionia cannot return to the way it was after the Noxian invasion, the scar has been left in the land and in the minds of the people**.  Fear and ambition now overrun the land, which probably gives a large feeding ground for spirits.  The government is now hiding secrets from its people and possibly from its other branches, best showcased by the fact that {{champion:202}} is under contract for some shadow branch.  \n\n{{champion:43}} isn't trying to eradicate anyone.  She wants to keep the place from falling apart.  But again, she **knows** that some traditions do not work as time moves forward.  Changes need to be made, but they need to be made **carefully**.  \n\n{{champion:43}}: Never become a monster to defeat one.\n\nOff Topic: This is honestly why I think {{champion:43}} would make a great teacher for {{champion:134}}.  Syndra's acts were brought about through adherence to a traditional teaching style that (while working) wasn't satisfying to the student.  Rather than try different methods, her teacher threatened to seal her powers (whether he could or not is a different matter) away permanently.  I feel Karma would be willing to try other techniques to help Syndra grow more powerful and more well learned in her power, which in the end could have made her into less of a  threat that Ionia sees her as today (a threat they created I might add).  \n\nIt's probably too late for that though (sad to say).  But I'd love to see {{champion:43}} try to reason with {{champion:134}}.  Namely by first agreeing with her that, \"Yeah, he was a poor teacher.\".","replies":[{"poster":"Meelan","date":"2016-04-02T21:39:05.966+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"I really like the idea that Karma is best suited as an optimal teacher for Syndra since karma doesn't deny that balance has an aggressive half. Elders did not believe in anything but peaceful ways. If people like Syndra were encouraged to gain power. Noxian invasion would've been harder for noxians.\n\nOn the other subject, I really think that nowadays she'd be the aspect of Ionia, you don't just call the emblem of ionia \"just because\". I wish they've compromised with it a little further. what I can't stand is that she doesn't have an animation live, when there was one on PBE.","replies":[{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2016-04-02T22:31:55.079+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think she needs to be an aspect.

This really shows us how much Riot is UNWILLING to let go of this boring kit.\n\nRiot has even said . . . . they don't have money in the budget to work on a new VU for Karma or her abilities.

Believe me, it has never been an issue of resources - almost always, it is their neglect for the player feedback system, and a blatant distancing from the market they claim to cater to. They never have the balls to admit that, of corse, nor do they even have the balls to lie about it either.\n\nLong story short, You're not gonna find that link.","replies":[{"poster":"Meelan","date":"2016-04-04T07:41:54.748+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"They do make a lot of money, but somehow I feel like one of the reasons for that is because they have a handful of artist and programmers, they're still \"a small indie company\"(lol) and that's what keeps things working together. And they fear growing larger in that aspect would make things less smooth thus they prefer to spend that money in more servers/infrastructure.\n\nI think Riot does have favoritism when it comes to champions and A LOT. Some champions don't work for whole seasons and that's \"okay\", but don't even think of letting Yasuo or Zed go underplay/underpower! I do understand that those champions get played a lot and loved by far more than say karma.\n With that in mind, I honestly think that Riot is one of the best, if not the best, of video game companies or companies in general when it comes to hearing complaints from their players/customers. They did listen to the players when karma had it's relaunch and i don't think you could point any other videogame with so much interest in players feedback.

She’s supposed to bring a new kind of magic to the table channeling her inner flame. Every other champion has a distinct element or concept attached to them. Lux has light; Brand has fire; Ryze has runes. One of the most noticeable exceptions is Karma. It feels like she fights with colours, thus her power is not well defined.\n\nIn [another thread](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/1gHXgBAb-why-league-of-legends-isnt-as-awesome-as-it-could-be-morello-meddler) I stumbled across not too long ago - done by the charming Yaime Loveheart - I learned a lot about how thematics hold kits together.\n\nThis is probably my main concern with Karma. She does NOT have a coherent theme and thus is all over the place.\nShe is a poke mage, a support, a burst mage, she has CC, she has a selfheal, she has tank scalings and other parts that want to build her glass canon. She has no niche in the game and just colorful spells. Most of her spells are halfhearted copies of spells that already were in the game.... one of the reasons why current Karma is more healthy. Of course, if you just take some healthy spells, that already exist and slap them together, you can barely fail that. Generic damage spell, LeBlanc tether, a shield with the only other buff we didn't have yet, Heimer ult on a lower cooldown and.... ugh, we forgot the passive. Whatever, just give her a CDR skillcheck, it'll be fine. _Bam_, done! \n\nHowever, I thought it wasn't even half bad until they removed the shieldbomb. Now even her RE is a generic copy of Talisman+Locket....\n\nBut what, if instead we could have a kit that made her twindragons of Ouroboros come to live? How cool would that be. Ouroboros, the dragon that bites its own tail, is the origin of the Yin-Yang symbol, the ∞ infinity sign and probably the ionian crest worn by Karma and Irelia. If Karma were to control them, both as awesome dragons and symbols of balance, infinity and enlightenment.... that would be so cool!\n\nThis is one of the reasons why I scrapped my last rework suggestion and tried implementing ideas from both you and Yaime.

I mean, I never had the pleasure of using her before the fabled rework, but I get the feeling that she's like, half of a complete champion.

Many people make the assumption that Rito-senpai can do no wrong, but Karma definitely isn't the only champ whose identity, meta strengths, kit, and playstile were completely undermined.\n\nYou ask \"Which Is The THEMATICALLY Less Successful Rework Riot Has Made?\" I personally think Mordekaiser earns a spot up on that list somewhere. He has completely lost his identity and charm with his rework last August, and is now even LESS of a juggernaut - even after receiving a so-called \"Juggernaut Rework.\" His abilities force him against bot lane opponents he was not designed to combat, his abilities lack the visceral impact they once did, and his visual theme is no longer unique. They knew they messed his heavy metal theme so badly, they renamed him the \"Iron Revenant,\" Because Ekko was more of a Master of Metal at that point.\n\nI feel ya though. Sometimes, less popular champs get screwed over by their reworks, and often, such mistakes are noticed, but rarely remedied - for the balance team is too busy making the more popular champs, well, more popular. Of the 40 champs you see in a given day, most of them were never blasted with updates that none of us asked for, and even if we did, they definitely weren't the changes we ultimately expected or wanted.

The third one was that quinn had a strange spot then, which was a toplane counterpick only , and with that update i think she pretty much gained the identity of \"roaming/splitpushing adc with some assasin elements\"which suited her scout thematics more imo, and she gained the versatility to be played everywhere except support, so i think it is overall a good rework. And also gameplay wise if you ever try to create the scene in your mind it will end up as they striking one after other (r-mark-auto--e-mark-auto -q-auto)but yeah i also miss wrecking people as valor ;-;","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Jaghatai","date":"2016-04-03T03:35:22.766+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:82}} \n\n*drops mic*","replies":[{"poster":"Meelan","date":"2016-04-03T21:03:48.578+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"THEMATICALLY he hasn't had his rework yet.","replies":[{"poster":"GreenLore","date":"2016-04-04T08:37:33.495+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually he did to some extent.\nThey removed all the metal magic from his kit and focused completely on the death magic.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"A Liberal","date":"2016-04-03T17:14:02.030+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Actually, Thematically his rework makes perfect sense.
