You miscalculated, luck didn't have anything to do with it. If you use the ult when they will live it then you messed up and should strive to be better so that it doesn't happen again.\n\nBesides, if they did implement this then it would have to lose one of its upsides. Either you would have to target the ground where you want to go, then she slashes behind her and then dashes, which would feel very awkward, especially if you are trying to do it in a burst combo since you would have to target them with your mouse and then move it way behind you when you want to ult, or it would have to be a charge ability which would A: make it cancellable, B: let them walk out of range before it goes off, and C: make the untargettable portion of the ability irrelevant since you cant react with it to cancel things.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
