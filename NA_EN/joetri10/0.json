One of the biggest request by just about everyone was her hair, and riot have for the most part completely disregarded it.. However a huge slap in the face has been added today in which they changed her hair color to an even WORSE shade of the color we DONT want. \n\nIs it a joke? are they trolling? Is it due to the ego of the skin artist? or are they just genuinely tying to force people off the game because it could be all of those. \nIt&#039;s her first skin in years, nobody likes it. A few changes could fix it for the better by FAR but they&#039;re too stuck up their own a*s to listen to the people who will be spending money on it. \nWhat are they doing and why are they so intent on ignoring people.. The PBE is honestly useless.\nThis has pissed of so many people for really no reason. We&#039;d be happier not even getting the skin and waiting for a better one because it&#039;s not very good, and Riot in the past have scrapped skins. \nListen to us or scrap it.... Otherwise what&#039;s even the point.\n\nEdit: I've pretty much decided that; as someone who owns every skin you can buy (Yes, really) and being an Evelynn main, i'm going to personally boycott the release if it goes out the way it is. i may be 1 out of millions but as someone so dedicated to both owning skins for collection and the champion itself, i want to make a point that this skin is 100% not ok.

Blood Moon Evelynn shows a lot more skin than other Blood Moon skins do, making a good portion of her model a light color. Adding white hair to this would have caused her model to be a blur when in motion and it'd be hard to pick apart exactly what you were looking it. From game height, we aim for larger shapes (also why models aren't insanely detailed when in game versus the splash - the textures are 512 x 512). \n\n**The skin looks like Lunar Wraith, not Blood Moon.**\n\nThat's feedback the team agreed with. There was *a lot of blue*, a color not generally associated with Blood Moon. The team took that feedback to heart and removed some of the blue, making her horns resemble the blue/gold gradient found on Blood Moon Else. The hair was also changed from a hotter pink to something more red, again, to align better with Blood Moon. The hotter pink was definitely trailing into Lunar Wraith Caitlyn's territory. \n\n**Is it due to the ego of the skin artist? **\n\nFair question, but no. The concept artist was working on paint overs/going through feedback loops for a good portion of yesterday afternoon. He made 4-5 paint overs of different hair and horn colors to see what could be pushed to make it feel Blood Moon. This was all based on feedback that Riot KiWiKiD had delivered to the team, coming from the boards, Reddit, YouTube, etc. \n\nOnce the team agreed on the changes, both the character artist and splash artist spent the rest of the afternoon applying the changes and then Riot KiWiKiD testing them. \n\n**Delay it.**\n\nWe have a release cadence and making larger scope changes on something we've planned x things for means taking away time from another skin's development - it's a slippery slope. It's why we can't 'just add sleeves' to something, for example. It's not simply adding sleeves, but also changing the rig entirely, changing all of her animations so the sleeves don't clip,  and adjusting the splash to accommodate the in-game visual changes. Changing an animation kit can take several days, especially on newer characters, like Eve. Tied into all of this is testing, which means testing the skin again in its entirety, which is another large task that takes several (+) days. \n\n**Scrap it.**\n\nI think this has become a go-to for when someone either doesn't like something, and it's the easiest way for them to communicate it versus constructive feedback .We'd done it once with Sewn Chaos and because it'd been done once, it's a matter of why not do it again? To be honest, we struggled with the Sewn Chaos skins and the confidence we had with them. They were cute, but didn't hit our quality bar, or the fantasy that they should have, and it was something we should have ice boxed way sooner than PBE. \n\n**TL;DR**:\n\nWe hear you! I know it's hard to believe sometimes when high scope changes are requested and they aren't applied. If you aren't sure why something is/isn't done, please ask (preferable on PBE 'cause the SME for the skin usually writes the post!)

Like, isn't it better to throw more hours at it, than shrugging and taking what you've learned and applying it to the next skin, which may be months or years down the line? \nI get that there's only so much time you can afford to devote to a single skin, you're a company and you need to make money to support your business, after all, but isn't there also a drive to make your work the best it can be? Like, if the same bit of feedback keeps popping up from multiple people, who all seem to be rather heavily devoted to the champion you're making a skin for this time around, isn't it worth taking to heart, even if it means more work, and delaying other things? \n\nI know this might sound accusing, but it's really not supposed to be, it's an honest question from an outsider who doesn't have an inside view of how your work process is done. Like, if this is the way you chose to go because the team behind the skin honestly believe this is the best version of the skin, then that's perfectly understandable. You're never going to be able to please everyone, and opinions differ a great deal, and that's fine. It really is.\nBut if it's only the version you're sticking with, not because you think it's the best it can be, but because it's what you're stuck with given the time you've already devoted to it, and the time it'd take to change it to something that may or may not be better, then it's a different matter entirely. \nBeing disappointed in a skin because your vision doesn't match with the vision other people has isn't great, but it's something reasonable people can get over because, as said, opinions differ. But being told 'Sorry, this is the best we can do, we just can't afford more time to change things, we'll just have to do better next time\", brings on a whole different kind of disappointment, and a certain wistful longing for 'what could have been'. \n\nAgain, I really, really hope I managed to phrase this in a manner that doesn't sound too negative or accusing, because it's really not the intent, but if I've failed in that, then I apologise in advance.","replies":[{"poster":"Chembaron Yamada","date":"2018-04-21T01:22:12.178+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, you can see it that way that you are pleasing the people devoted to the champ you are currently working on, but this means (like you said yourself) delaying the other projects.\n\nWhich kinda can hurt the fan and playerbase of another champ waiting for a new skin for a long time.

They'd might have to wait longer, but they'd do so knowing that they'd be able to expect the same sorta effort. You could argue that it'd be a case of quality vs quantity. I'd certainly not suggest that extra effort or time should be put into just certain skins while others should be 'rushed'. That'd be entirely unfair.","replies":[{"poster":"Chembaron Yamada","date":"2018-04-21T11:54:16.979+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, but the thing about \"quality vs. quantity\" here is that it will still increase the suffering of unpopular champions...\n\nWith the current skin development speed, we already have champions who didn't get a new skin for 6 years. Imagine what will happen if we slow down that process significantly.\n\nFor example, my beloved Jinx and her playerbase won't suffer that much. She is popular and gets skins regularly. Waiting 2 years instead of 1 for a new skin is fine, if that guarantees a better quality, since the team is willing to put more time into it.\n\nExample of the other side: the next new skin for my boy Urgot was more than 6 years ago. He is unpopular and probably considered kinda hard to make skins for by the skin team, he won't get skins at the same cadence as Ahri and the likes. Now if they stretch that waiting time from 6 years to 7, it kinda sucks, even if they would put more time into working out the details.\n\n_______________\n\nStretching the skin process by putting more time into each skin does not benefit every playerbase equally, it just widens the gap. Since more time will be spent for champions which get skins every year because of their popularity.\n\nAnd the player bases don't all have the same priority when it comes to quality vs. quantity.\n\nImagine 2 guys in a restaurant, both ordering a meal.\nOne guy just ate 3 hours ago, the other one is literally starving and didn't eat for days.\n\nNow the waiter comes to tell both that their meal will take an additional hour, but that will make sure it is extra delicious.\n\nThe well fed guy will probably accept that. Why shouldn't he? He got promised better quality for his waiting time and will enjoy the meal more that way.\n\nThe starving guy most likely won't react the same. He doesn't have that luxury, he doesn't care for an improved quality, his main priority is just to _eat finally_. If he has the choice, he will most likely tell them to serve him a lower quality food immediately instead of waiting any longer.","replies":[{"poster":"Líthillya","date":"2018-04-21T13:37:43.497+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Will it though? Yes, there might be longer time between skin releases, especially, as you point out, for less than popular champions. But that'll also be the case if they stick with the current schedule. Let's use your example; you've waited six years for a new Urgot skin. Imagine now that they've decided to release a new one, but it ends up feeling rushed and instead of excited about it, you end up with a feeling of disappointment with what you're given. Are you still going to buy that skin? Are you still going to enjoy having it? Or are you stuck waiting another six years, hoping they'll get it right next time?\n\nUsing the restaurent analogy; the starving guy is offered a meal, but is told that he'll either have to accept waiting longer, or risk getting food poisoning. He can get a meal, but it'll leave him far less than sated and satisfied. \n\nI know, I know, this is taking the example to the extreme, but in fairness, yours also assumes that the skin, or the meal in this case, is something that the customer in question will perhaps not be thrilled with, but at least satisfied. \nI think we're both, to a point, playing devil's advocate here, by pointing out the worst risks at the different side of the issue.","replies":[{"poster":"Chembaron Yamada","date":"2018-04-21T13:50:08.781+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Totally agree with you here. :)\n\nMy point is not really to prove that your suggestion is wrong (that's impossible to prove), but, like you said, I was playing devil's advocate by pointing out the worst case scenario possible, making aware that there is always risk playing in to majorly disappoint parts of the community.\n\nYou make good points, if Urgot would get a rushed and (in my opinion) \"ugly\" skin after that long wait, it would be crushing.

We have craft/design reasoning behind the choices we make as a team.\n\nHello Mr/Ms Riot Katey Khaos, I know I'm a bit late to the party but I thoughtI should at least put my two cents into the argument. \n I personally really like the skin, I love blood moon and I really think it soots Eve with her being a sadistic demon.\nBUT I do have some things that I don't like. \n1. The changed horns, I never really liked the horns on Eve to begin with seeing as when she's in her human form she's supposed to look.... Well Human, but I REALLY don't like the gold horns when compared to the blue ones because of the way the colors were implemented. They blue was okay because it fit the color scheme of the skin, but the gold ones just look forced and out of place. I mean where else do you see that gold fade into to blue like on Elise, the answer is no where. It worked on Elise for two reasons. 1. there were more the two, and 2. even though they were a huge part of the skin they still felt like a different part of  the character, they were interesting, but they only drew your attention for a moment before you became distracted again by her dress and mask and tattoos. The reason this is possible is because the legs are on her back not the front, you guys did the same thing with Eve's lashers. For Eve though the horns DON'T match the color scheme, And they ARE right up front, sticking out like a sore thumb. The off blue went REALLY REALLY WELL with the dark blue black on her lashers. \n2. The hair color\nI think alot of people don't like the new hair color compared to the the original hair color. In my opinion, there are, again, two reasons for this. 1, The old hair just looked more natural to the skin. It just felt like it suited Eve better. 2. The new color highlights  the horns, BUT it also kind of alienates them as well, because TBH the horn color just does not match the skin. \n3. Animations. Im going to split this up into two parts the W animation and the E animation.\nPart 1 the W animation.  I not going to lie, the W animation just doesn't fit the skin, it fits Masquerade Eve just fine, but not blood moon. The Easiest solution would be to just make the W animation a Blood Moon symbol, I mean why has no one thought of that. \n\nPart 2 The E the problem that I have with the E animation is that although it looks ok there is definitely one major problem. The Empowered E Lashers stab the enemy with THE BLUNT SIDE OF THE LASHERS, it doesn't take a genius to understand that that isn't realistic.

We have craft/design reasoning behind the choices we make as a team.\n\n\n**Adding white hair to this would have caused her model to be a blur when in motion**\n\nThis is the opinion of the artist and the team which is very limited, lazy and problematic, as well as a bit unbelievable and stubborn sounding. A bold color such as red/pink though may not cause a problem with motion, but it's an eye sore. There is a fan art of blood moon skin for Evelynn that notes the biggest problem, her color scheme is BOLD. Her skin is largely the issue, it's a washed out strong purple and that would cause the blur motion with less potent and moulding soft colors.. The problem with her hair comes at the fact that her skin causes it to becoming a problem and her clothes just then look out of place. I can't really describe it, but the issue comes that it's not the hairs fault for the blur if white, it's the ENTIRE color scheme. It doesn't look like much effort has gone into it but the opinion that 'it's fine' from the artist is causing it to be held back. \nThe blood moon line should be about it's thematic representation, not how much red, blue and purple you can shove on a model and call it a day. \nit's LAZY. \n\n** making her horns resemble the blue/gold gradient found on Blood Moon Else.**\n\nYou've missed the point. The horns being blue were not the problem, and red hair is not part of the theme! This is extremely reminiscent to the Three Kingdoms skin line, where they originally derived from Dynasty Warrior designs, and later on just thrown together to look somewhat like it belongs but it really doesn't. Again, this is down to laziness. \n\n**Fair question, but no. The concept artist was working on paint overs/going through feedback loops for a good portion of yesterday afternoon. He made 4-5 paint overs of different hair and horn colors to see what could be pushed to make it feel Blood Moon. This was all based on feedback that Riot KiWiKiD had delivered to the team, coming from the boards, Reddit, YouTube, etc. **\n\nAnd yet we, the consumer, the fans who gave the feedback, we saw none of this, we're just being thrown a bunch of lines of 'promises' together. You take and you don't give back and that's essentially missing the point of feedback. Why can't we see it for ourselfs, even though we already have with the fan skin that was made. Honestly i still think it comes down to the ego of the artist in the fact that the fan art Evelynn skin is literally WHAT the skin should be, and you guys are extremely hard pressed on giving the creator credit, and adapting the skin to it. You really REALLY do not want to accept that someone who is not working with you guys have made something better. Let's be brutally honest with ourselves there. \n\n**but didn't hit our quality bar, or the fantasy that they should have**\n\nAnd neither does this. Sorry but adding a flute to a very disgustingly red shadow form does not work. Again, lazy\n\nAs for me asking on the PBE, i can't access the PBE apparently, so i had to do it on here.\n\nI mean to be honest you've done the same thing as on the PBE anyway. You've thrown a bunch of excuses my way to cover up serious situations or you've addressed situations that we never a problem. \nNo one has yet to address the fact that the skin does not, by everyone's general opinion whether they 'like it' or not, fit what the Blood Moon line SHOULD be. You've just thrown a bunch of blue and red together and called it a day. Anyone can do that. \nSomeone has created what is literally the embodiment of what the skin should be to a pinch.. Use it. because right now ignoring the SJW, you have about 95% of the Evelynn community pissed the hell off... And you don't want GBAY99's video to become true surely. Swallow the pride, contact the artist, delay the skin, get to work on a skin Evelynn players will actually BUY and act like a company that listens. \n https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjatHBy2wbQ\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ95zlPqEec&amp;amp=&amp;feature=youtu.be\n\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"EROTIC RAID BOSS","date":"2018-04-20T22:42:18.084+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How viable would it be to make her face in demon form a white mask like the blood moon masks?
