In season 6, I climbed to Gold 5. The following season I was placed Silver 3 in Solo/Duo and Bronze 3 in Flex. The issue I'm having is even though I was Bronze 3 in flex it was still matching me against Gold-Plat with Bronze on my team. I somehow climbed up to Bronze 2 last season despite that then stopped playing because I figured maybe next season it would get fixed and match me with the rank I'm placed. Now this season it placed me Bronze 2 in flex... exactly where I left off last season. No big deal I thought. First game after placements another Gold rank on the enemy team and bronze on mine. I'm done with this. Please reset my account. I'd rather you place me in bronze 5 with an mmr so low it makes bronze 5 look good, than play these one sided games because you destroyed my mmr by placing me two tiers lower than my previous rank and continue to match me with my previous rank. If you're going to place someone somewhere then match them with the same rank... At this point I might as well make a new account. I'd get placed in high silver or higher with ease and I'd be matched with the same rank... What is the point in even using this account anymore it's completely screwed.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-17T03:50:01.576+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea this seems pretty hard to manage with how it sounds. There might be some slight confusion on how the system matches people up, but if you were Bronze there's a chance you could definitely be placed against Silver depending on how well you've been doing or if the other team in Flex is duoing by chance. The [**Flex Q Limitations**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204010760) mentions that Bronze players can queue up with Silver players, so that's possible. Otherwise, if you're being placed against people of higher rank it might be a clue that you've been doing so well your MMR might be higher than you think.","replies":[{"poster":"Crossarms","date":"2018-01-17T03:51:33.480+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Broporo,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=l2lUj6n7,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2018-01-17T03:50:01.576+0000)\n>\n> Yea this seems pretty hard to manage with how it sounds.

Lol my MMR for flex seems to be around gold. The issue is its not placing me on balanced teams.\n","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-17T04:14:35.601+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmm getting matched with players higher than Gold doesn't seem like it should happen. I'd suggest hitting up the game agents in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) so they can take an in-depth look at your account for a better explanation. \n\nOverall I'm seeing your recent games were matched with mostly Silvers, and again, it could just be that your MMR is pushing Gold level and the system is trying to get you ranked up to where you should be. Winning against harder odds where the system thinks you might lose would result in higher LP gains, pushing you closer to where you should be. Overall, this might just be the system trying to help you rank up.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Crossarms","date":"2018-01-17T03:57:47.589+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a serious issue and your telling me there is no way to fix it?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Crossarms","date":"2018-01-17T03:56:50.996+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not fair for my team either.
