At the rate its going this shits over. Competitive league is boring. Climbing the ladder is a pointless grind, the meta is a stale shit show the most boring thing alive, the players are all cry babys thanks to this toxicity bullshit and you can get banned for almost anything, range champions rule all, tanks are the best thing besides adc&#039;s. \r\n\r\nReasons me and mannnnnny others have been playing games that are actually fun like fortnite. This game needs a fixing so that the games more healthy, more diversity, and getting rid of the cry baby ass player base. Just remove chat from the game and only ban for inting and trolling would make the game actually playable again. Until they do anything which knowing riot prob wont happen the games dead. Fortnite and others will take over. Also having skillful things in the game like before would be great. Too many champions like brand that can miss everything but press r and kill your whole team. Shits not fun being killed by complete morons.","replies":[]}
