The key word is \"feels,\" which maybe I didn't emphasize enough. I was talking about his role identity. Is Morde a fighter or is he a mage? The answer is a little bit of both right now. Should his gameplay be more about getting into position and then using abilities or should it be more about managing resources? Should he emphasize range or melee? We are even okay with tanky mages, so long as they still have some weaknesses the other team can leverage -- it's not okay to just be a champ who doesn't have weaknesses.\n\nOur suspicion is he'd play better as a fighter, but we're certainly open to feedback on the issue.\n\nP.S.

Sion only works because he's pseudo ranged, he's basically still a caster and will never be sitting around autoing anyone. This is the only way morde will not suck unless you give him more mobility.\n\nAlso, giving morde gapclosing ability solely if he has a dive partner to go in before him seems lame if you want him to be a fighter imo. Fighters are individual go in and mess someone up people. If I wanted to be completely team dependent to accomplish anything I'd be playing a tank instead of a \"fighter\".\n\n\nAnd this is unrelated but I really wish you guys would look at teleport again already. Making plays around the map is cool and all but it should come with an actual tradeoff of being weaker in lane compared to pure 1v1 summoner skills. Instead it was basically always taken in the korean pro 1v1 tournament. In mid lane meaning it didn't even save as much time as in top. It's really lame how it's killing lane bullies and incentivizing \"sit top and scale while teleport prevents you from being punished for getting forced out of lane\".","replies":[{"poster":"McAllister","date":"2015-02-22T18:16:44.918+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Holy unrelated, Batman.

I just also wanted to mention a balance problem I think is pretty ridiculous atm and never gets talked about.\n\nFirst off it should give you more lane power, not just 'as much' since teleport has added utility and play making potential and ignite is there solely to help you 1v1 people. But it doesn't even do that. A person with tp should beat a person with ignite in a balanced lane and that's just stupid.\n\n>I'm glad the Koreans like it, but I think it's fine.\n\nOk? You're not as good at laning as korean or western high elo all of whom apparently think teleport is blatantly superior. Ignite might get you a kill if your opponent is stupid and stays in lane after getting chunked instead of using teleport for an hp and item advantage but it's not as good if the person with teleport is using it correctly.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2015-02-22T17:56:42.183+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ghostcrawler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=6G2sFs3v,comment-id=0007,timestamp=2015-02-22T16:32:33.730+0000)\n> P.S.

(as long as you're doing slightly more damage than them, you will kill them, and they won't even break your shield)\nIf you can't, you won't, and since you won't, you're not going to catch up, and you'll be one giant heavy hunk of metal your team is gonna have to carry to victory.\n\nI feel like the changes aren't going to have any affect on that at all. It might change his lane match ups a little, he'll do better vs some now, worse vs others. But still, if you can't single-handedly nuke the hell out of someone, you're gonna be a weight for your team.\n\nAnd making him pure tank seems awful. I mean, if he's low enough damage to justify being tanky enough, why would anyone even attack him? He'd be very easy to just completely ignore till everyone else is dead, then loop back around and wipe him out.\nI mean other tanks can be disruptive, maok can root and knockup/slow people, malp can aoe knockup your whole team, then spam slows, Galio, Rammus and Shen can literally *force* people to attack them, etc.\nWhat's morde going to do as pure tank? Walk into the middle of the enemy team and shout: HUEHUEHUE MORDE NUMERO UNO 1V1 ME SCRUBS\ntill they get annoyed enough to waste skills on him?\nAnd even more on the 'fighter' end, he's going to be either unbalanced levels of stronk, or still less damage and therefor not priority target for a smart team till they bypass him and killed everyone else. The tanky part is rarely going to matter unless it's in a 1v1.\n\nI think he needs either 1 of 2 things:\nSomething unexpected/optional things he can do. (cause right now it's pretty much 'oh hey, there's a morde there..and I'm in a bad spot..I wonder if he's going to walk up and E/Q/R me or..*or*...walk up and E/R/Q me?)\n---\nOr (I like this one better)\nOnce he's build up a massive amount of shield, he gets the option to **release** that shield for f@#$tons of damage. (maybe in the form of something like {{champion:107}} /{{champion:58}} system? Like over XX amount of shield, it changes his basic abilities to stronger abilities and burns the shield in exchange for *a lot* of damage)\nIn that way, there's still a reason to damage him enough so he **doesn't get over XX amount of shield** built up, and allowing him to be a 0 cc tanky/bruiser still.","replies":[]},{"poster":"McAllister","date":"2015-02-22T18:34:31.511+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If it makes you feel any better, you're getting upvoted and OP's getting downvoted.\n\nMy feedback is that his ult needs to go.  \"The champ that can turn 5v5 into 6v4\" just consumes way too much power budget.  When I play Morde, I want to feel like a train, and my opponents are either scrambling out of the way or standing in front of me to try and stop me.  I want to feel like towers are my opponents, minions are wheat waiting to be threshed, and the enemy champions are dogs nipping at my heels.  I'm not saying I want Morde to be OP, but rather, describing the fantasy: I want to keep my sick waveclear, keep my ability to fight multiple opponents by gaining health/shield from hitting them, and use them to be a split-pushing juggernaut.\n\nThe ult, however, doesn't fit into the fantasy: it seems like it wants to be used as a target selector a in a 5v5 teamfight, which isn't where I think Morde shines.

Fighters seem to need cc and initiation ability to be viable. Without cc or movement it is extremely hard to kill people solo, and that is already an issue with him now, let alone after itemization changes.\n\nOther than not knowing the champion, one thing that probably caused the disappointed reaction [is that he's currently mainly played in mid lane as he is better there](http://www.leagueofgraphs.com/champions/stats/mordekaiser). \n\nAlso I hope you know the health based shield was never in pbe.
