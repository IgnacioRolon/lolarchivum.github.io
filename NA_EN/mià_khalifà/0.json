The length of the honor lock is dependent upon your behavior.\nOnce honor is unlocked, you are able to progress in honor again. The rate of honor gain is dependent upon your behavior.","replies":[{"poster":"Mià Khalifà","date":"2017-09-26T07:52:33.973+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So what your telling me is that since i got banned for 14 days the lvl 4 honor i had is now gone but i earn it back if my behavior is good / great with not being toxic and all the other things that you can get reported for.","replies":[{"poster":"RallerenP","date":"2017-09-26T09:27:05.569+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't really get why you're surprised. You were dishonorable, so why should keep you honor?\n\nYou won't get it back as in instant lvl 4. Your honor is reset, but you can still gain levels (when it unlocks that is). You will have to be honorable to get it unlocked. \n\nSo no, you probably wont get lvl 4 this season, and you wont get it back for free. you will have to grind for it, just like you did from level 2 previously.

Not neccesarily. And of course you lose your honor.
