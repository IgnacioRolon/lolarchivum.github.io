You just walk in and tank all the damage and the enemies die because of it. Well what if I told you that you could heal when you get damaged and get passive lifesteal for building armor? Well you can! \r\nIf you go Ravenous Hunter on Rammus you become really strong. Like Relentless is pretty good, don&#039;t get me wrong. Map presence is awesome on Rammus, but taking Ravenous hunter makes it so you heal from your W, Thornmail, Q, R, and Passive. Yes Rammus gets free lifesteal. Movement Speed is awesome, but I don&#039;t like to die. You go to chickens at half health with it fully stacked and you exit out full (May be an exageration). People please realize how great it is, at least it&#039;s my personal preference. Try it out for a match or two.","replies":[{"poster":"skoulker","date":"2018-03-16T01:20:35.226+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not all the ravenous.
