I always hear the sound of a error window coming up, but cannot see it; shortly after my computer just completely freezes and I&#039;m forced to restart it. Sometimes&mdash;but not always&mdash;the game will just black out for a bit and then return. This did not happen until these recent patches.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m using Windows 7 (64 bit), NVIDIA GeForce GTX 970, and 16 GB of ram. I can send recent R3d logs if necessary.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-12T20:52:49.134+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmm it really sounds like your pc is having a hard time getting ARAM's to load correctly.
