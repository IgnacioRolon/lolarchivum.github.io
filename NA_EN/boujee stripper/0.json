The person has not logged in or removed anyone on friends list, but i havea  unique name and am afriad of the account being sold, name being sold, or decaying soon. How can i get riots attention quicker? or do i just have to wait it out? i sent my email 3 days ago and im starting to worry how long it will take to resolve. If riot has more questions and i have to email more responses, this can take over a week to resolve and im fearing the worst. I spent too much time on this acc and just worried for the worst. Please help soon","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-19T21:50:48.228+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's no ticket expedition, and you'll receive a response in the order that it came as well as depending on the size of the queue.  I looked into this for you and  do see quite a few tickets on this, so a few will likely be closed to prevent delays or confusion towards your case.  Your ticket has been escalated to our account team, and they'll reach out to you as soon as possible.  Unfortunately, any ranked decay that would occur can't be disabled so it may be necessary to replay some ranked.  Hang tight, and we'll help as soon as we can!","replies":[{"poster":"Boujee Stripper","date":"2016-10-19T22:42:34.242+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ah, what are the steps that the tickets take to process if its up to account team now? like is t here a template/layout for the process?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-19T22:44:08.504+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Usually Blitzbot will be the first to respond, because in most cases he can automatically help a player with their account recovery.  More sensitive cases or those where not enough account verification was provided would then be sent to our account team to be reviewed personally.  Great question, and I hope that helps clear things up!","replies":[{"poster":"Boujee Stripper","date":"2016-10-20T01:19:19.511+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"this does give some helpful info, but by my ticket being sent to the accounts team means its a personal? if thats so, im hoping so because i provided a surplus of evidence over my 4 years that the account is mine and plenty of screenshots. its been 3 days already and i wanted to know, if they have anything else to say, would my email be sent back UP the queue so i have to wait a while for a reply? or would it be sent back as a priority as an open case?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-20T15:37:18.736+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Once a specialist responds to your ticket, you'll be in direct contact with them and no longer in queue.
