More than half the time (more often in a longer queue), my teammates tell me that the \"match found\" notification is up and I see nothing. Unless I wait for another minute or so before force closing the client, I get no indication that matchmaking has stopped (timer running, etc.) but when I do I get the \"PVP.net has disconnected\" notification. I don't crash, but I have to be reinvited and requeue, mostly to go through the same ordeal (never getting to champion select and eventually getting decline penalties).\r\n\r\nI have -\r\n\r\n* Repaired the client\r\n\r\n* Disabled IP Helper (permanently)\r\n\r\n* Tried the DNS settings (before setting them back to default when this failed)\r\n\r\n* Allowed several .exe's in the League folder through my firewall\r\n\r\n* Flushed DNS and reset IP and Winsock\r\n\r\n* Run as administrator\r\n\r\nI am fairly sure this is not a disconnect on my _internet's_ side as I can still talk to friends in Discord while the disconnect is happening. This is either a client issue or an issue with client-server communication. I am at a loss as for what to do at this point - I don't play ranked right now but this is frustrating for my friends and I who have to waste time requeuing until I get lucky enough.\r\n\r\n_Other information:_\r\nI run Windows 10 and I meet the requirements by quite a bit (I doubt that is an issue). Please mention if you need any other information.
