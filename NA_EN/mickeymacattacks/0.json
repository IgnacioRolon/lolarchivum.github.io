Please fix this Riot.","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"7.4 is a broken patch, I don't know what you guys at Riot did, but this is ridiculous.\r\n\r\nAfter finally managing to find a way to solve this annoying ping spike issue that was originally causing the game to be unplayable, now I have another issue that I have to deal with. I now can't play any game mode in League without it crashing, bugsplatting and not allowing me to reconnect to the game that I was just in. Everytime that i've bugsplatted, and tried to reconnect so that I don't get penalized, it fails and tells me that there is an error in my game files and that it need to be repaired. I let the client do it's thing (which doesn't fix a single thing btw) and then try to play again and it crashes. I know that if I keep trying to play a game and disconnect, that i'm going to receive some form of punishment that I don't deserve to begin with, and that isn't fair to someone who honestly loves this game and constantly pours money into it.\r\n\r\nI know that this isn't an isolated incident, as the boards are filled with multiple discussions about the ping spikes and connection issues. \r\n\r\nIf you have any info on how to make this problem go away, I would love to hear it, cause it's ruining the game for me and I just want to grind.","replies":[{"poster":"G  nizzle44","date":"2017-02-27T16:45:05.341+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't mean to derail this thread from what you originally intended, but I am seriously in need of help.

What I had to do was move my router to my room and then hard wire in. It's stupidly inconvenient and not something that everyone can do, so it may not work for you. Up until this patch, I've been able to use my wireless connection just fine, but this was the only solution I had left.","replies":[{"poster":"G  nizzle44","date":"2017-02-27T17:11:05.878+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, that's not really an option I have.
