(North America)","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"So i've been playing through 7.x just fine, no fps drop or ping spikes, but since this patch this morning (7.4), my ping has started skyrocketing randomly while playing, particularly during very busy moments, such as teamfights or going for dragon. I disabled the Xbox gamebar thing ages ago , so I know that it's not causing the issue. I've seen a few scattered posts about the ping spikes in different regions, but since Riot hasn't made any post about it, I don't know if this is an isolated situation. my current internet speed is 95mbps up/121mbps down. I've never had any trouble playing League at these speeds before hand.\r\n\r\nI've done everything from:\r\n* Restarted the client\r\n* Reinstalled the client\r\n* closed all outside programs but league\r\n* used the repair tool\r\n* restarted my Modem/router.\r\n\r\n\r\nI don't know what's going on, but I really want to get back to grinding out of the cesspool that is Bronze","replies":[{"poster":"MickeyMacAttacks","date":"2017-02-24T23:43:24.979+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been working all morning to fix this problem, and i've done everything in the connection guide to troubleshoot this \"connection\" problem that supposedly having and nothing has worked.

All I know is that up until this patch, I have had no problems with playing league hours on end with no issue what so ever.

Been happening for 3 patches now and each patch I have gone through the connection guide with no change.\n\nFix yer shit riot... also fix your shitty FPS drops while your at it. FPS drops have been happening since well beyond last season with no changes. Its like attempting to play with marbles but they just keep rolling around to where you can't do anything.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tipsyy","date":"2017-02-24T16:18:52.887+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"same exact problem is happening with me , i will go through the connection guide and inform you guys about the results , lets hope it works ! :D{{summoner:32}}","replies":[{"poster":"MickeyMacAttacks","date":"2017-02-27T14:46:19.447+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Tipsyy,realm=EUW,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=7PsJaysA,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2017-02-24T16:18:52.887+0000)\n>\n> same exact problem is happening with me , i will go through the connection guide and inform you guys about the results , lets hope it works ! :D{{summoner:32}}\n\nDid anything get any better?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Tipsyy","date":"2017-02-24T17:39:41.414+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"went through the guide , nothing happened i have submitted a ticket with all the info needed , please fix this asap , i wanna play URF :( please {{item:3070}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-24T03:42:39.638+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Patches only change local files in your League directory, therefore, they're **very unlikely** to cause an impact with your connection.
