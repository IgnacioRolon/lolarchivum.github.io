[Not solved]","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello, I have been _playing League of Legends for a while_ and everything has gone nicely but I have just realized that the **game isn't updated to 7.4**. My sister who plays League of Legends with me pointed it out. **I still have the old version and I don't know how to get the new one. Also yes, I know that when you open the Launcher it should automatically add it in. But it hasn't done that like it should. Is there something I'm suppose to do so the game can update?** . I've been playing this game for a week and it's still in the old version. I really do want it to be updated. Hopefully  someone can help me.","replies":[{"poster":"HeyItzSteve","date":"2017-03-05T18:43:53.192+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is no way that you could be playing on an older version of League of Legends if you are playing in NA. It updates automatically. Either, it is updated and you just don't know, or you are playing in a different region where the update hasn't gotten pushed out yet.","replies":[{"poster":"KatBlair","date":"2017-03-05T19:45:19.604+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh ok!

It's possible that it's simply a visual bug, which you may be able to resolve by running a quick repair by hitting the cog (gears) icon in the top-right corner of the client before starting the repair from that menu.\n\nLet me know if this helped.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
