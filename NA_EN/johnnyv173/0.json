I can log in, queue up, and get through champ select no problem, but while loading in usually somewhere between 50 and 60 percent i stop loading and get a message saying i need to relaunch. If i relaunch too quickly i only get a black screen and can never get into the game but if i wait until the game actually starts i can get in every time. It is frustrating because it makes me miss the first wave and puts me at a huge disadvantage. I've tried reinstalling but that didn't fix anything. It only happens when I'm at my mother's house. It doesn't happen if I use a different computer as well. Any help would be greatly appreciated","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-06T19:10:42.926+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You might have a connection problem holding onto the game server, and getting cut off.
