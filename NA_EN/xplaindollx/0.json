I tried to do what they notification told me to do but it wouldn't let me log back in. I then tried to restart my client and it wouldn't even let me log in (the client did boot though). Are you guys having server issues? Normally I wouldn't be this bitchy but seriously, that notification for random DC's has been there for over 2 weeks.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-13T18:17:26.371+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wasn't able to find any server issues during this time.
