This happens both in lobbies and in games and I have lost and entire division of elo because of this (I've dropped from S4 to S5). I've tried changing around the files, checking my internet connection (which is working fine for everything else), even running the client in a compatibility mode as I'm on windows 10. Is riot having server issues or is this specific to a region (I'm in north-western Minnesota)? Please help me out because I'm sick of taking que dodge penalties and losses because of this.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-19T18:42:26.400+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"PvP.net Connection timeouts are often caused by your client dropping or encountering a weak connection to the servers. Most of the time, this is a result of local network settings that cause instability, so I suggest taking a look at our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) as a first step.\n\nLet me know if those steps helped.","replies":[]}]}
