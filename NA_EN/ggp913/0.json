It doesn't feel too good to have worked for those skins only to have them become more easily available. In retrospect, those skins were given out simply by referring friends to join the game. Now with the new honor system capsules, you'll need to get lucky enough to get a capsule and then the skins. \n\nWith that being said, this system is still new and we're looking at better ways to rewards those who already had the skins. You can still get the same rewards others are getting through the Honor capsules, and also be on the lookout on our news page for updates on new Honor skins and such!","replies":[{"poster":"GGP913","date":"2017-07-04T00:55:17.737+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"might as well put the pax skins in the honor capsules too i know it was from a event but you know new players would never of had the chance too get it i think that would be amazing since just like the grey ww and twitch were something you had too do so was going to the PAX event also i would love a chance too get that TF skin","replies":[]}]}]}
