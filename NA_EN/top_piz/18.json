Box B MIGHT contain something far more important than the thing in box A, or box B might be empty. You can&#039;t tell since it&#039;s opaque.\n\nHere&#039;s the trick. Before beginning this game, your personality was analyzed by a computer program that is accurate in its analyses 99.9% of the time. If the computer thought you would take ONLY box B at this moment, then it put the really important thing in box B. If the computer program thought you would take both box B and box A at this moment, then it put nothing at all in box B.\n\nKnowing all of this, what do you do? Do you take only box B, or do you take both boxes?\n\nAfternote;\n\nThis is the logical paradox known as Newcomb&#039;s Paradox. It&#039;s possible to come to both conclusions with valid, objective logic, so no matter which conclusion you come to, you aren&#039;t wrong. I&#039;m merely interested in seeing what conclusion you guys individually come to, and how exactly you come to that conclusion. Please don&#039;t read others&#039; replies before forming your own.\n\nEDIT-\n\nSince this has been up for about a half hour, I'll put the two standard logical routes here. Don't read this if you haven't replied yet.\n\nLOGIC FOR CHOOSING BOX A AND BOX B-\nThe computer's prediction was made before you began the game, so your choice has absolutely no bearing on what is in box B. Therefore, since your decision doesn't affect whether box B is empty or not, you should take both boxes.\n\nLOGIC FOR CHOOSING ONLY BOX B-\nIf the computer predicted you would pick only box B, then it put the really important thing in box B. The computer is right 99.9% of the time. Therefore, you should pick only box B, because then the computer probably predicted you would pick box B, and you will almost definitely get the really important thing.\n\nIt's likely difficult for you to understand both sides since they directly conflict with one another logically. Try to think about it for a while.\n\nEDITx2-\n\nLOGIC FOR TAKING ONLY BOX B ELABORATED:\nIf I take both boxes, the computer probably predicted I would do so with it's 99.9% accuracy. If the computer predicted I would take both boxes, it put nothing in box B. Therefore, if I take both boxes, I will only get the thing in box A, because box B is almost definitely empty.\n\nIf I take only box B, the computer probably predicted I would do so with it's 99.9% accuracy. If the computer predicted I would take only box B, it put the really important thing in box B. Therefore, if I take only box B, I will get the really important thing almost definitely.\n\nIt goes to follow that I should only take box B since the thing in box B is more important than the thing in box A, and either choice will result in me only receiving the contents of a single box.","replies":[]}
