When people say things like this to me I feel outraged to the point where I would love nothing more than to flame them. I've been maining Gangplank this entire season and I currently have a 4.11 KDA with him; does that sound useless to you?\r\n\r\nMy point is, please don't make your teammates feel terrible just because they're playing a slightly unconventional champion or a viable champion in an unconventional role. They may be extremely good at it, yet you'll never be able to find that out since you pissed them off so much.","replies":[]}
