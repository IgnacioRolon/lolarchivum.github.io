There is not a single reason to play him unless you&#039;re running a pure poke comp, and even then there are far better options available (Lux mid, Jayce if you need ad; Ezreal or Lucian bot). And don&#039;t tell me his winrate is only low because people are learning how to play him; if that&#039;s true, you can learn how to play him in normal games. I can only dodge once a day.\n\nhttp://champion.gg/statistics/#?sortBy=general.winPercent&amp;order=ascend&amp;roleSort=Middle\n\nhttp://champion.gg/statistics/#?sortBy=general.winPercent&amp;order=ascend&amp;roleSort=ADC\n\nEDIT-\n\nI created this thread because I was mad that so many people were playing a brand new champion in ranked even though they had very little experience with him. I don't have much against Jhin as a champion (although I've yet to see a single person carry on him), and I'm sure his winrate will go up at least somewhat in time. However, that doesn't mean it's OK to spam games with him in ranked when you have no idea what you're doing.
