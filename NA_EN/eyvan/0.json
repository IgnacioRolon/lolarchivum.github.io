As its not a game breaking bug, it would still be nice if this little detail could be touched up. P.S. Posted this bug on the League of Legends subreddit, and others have confirmed that they see white particles as well, not just my computer.\r\n\r\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-11-13T17:49:55.184+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Morning GetReap! \n\nThis is actually working as intended. \n\nFor a bit of context here - you're right that the spear originally had red particles. Unfortunately, in colorblind mode, this particular color was really hard to see. D: As a result, we changed the color to a. still keep with the thematic of the skin and b. to help players who are red-green colorblind better see the spears when they're in play.","replies":[]}]}
