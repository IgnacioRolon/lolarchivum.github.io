I wanted to check to see if your account could have possibly been compromised and the password changed, but you forgot to give me the Summoner name of the LAN account. \n\nHit me back up with the LAN Summoner name and I'll double check to make sure everything is okay. In the meantime, you could also reach out to our account team using the [**account recovery form**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=72416) just in case!","replies":[{"poster":"Tobîas Fate ","date":"2017-05-29T00:41:22.313+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also, ive posted this on reddit and a lot of LAN users are experiencing this too apparently.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-29T01:06:06.999+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the heads up! I've double checked that LAN account and it doesn't look like it's been compromised at all, so we're all good on that front!\n\nI've also asked around, and it seems like there might be a few issues with the LAN login servers. I'm going to keep my eye open for this to make sure it isn't a widespread problem, but in the meantime, I would suggest going ahead and shooting us a ticket about that login issue so that we can accurately track this and provide updates!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Tobîas Fate ","date":"2017-05-29T00:40:01.703+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"The LAN ign is Astro","replies":[]}]}]}
