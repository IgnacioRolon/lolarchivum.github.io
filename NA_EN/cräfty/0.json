He's been waiting for almost 3 years, now...","subforum":"Gameplay","embed":{"description":"↑ Ekko's profile page at LeagueOfLegends.com","url":"https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Ekko","image":"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/3/33/Ekko_OriginalCentered.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/1215?cb=20180414202030"},"up_votes":3,"down_votes":10,"body":"Can you give {{champion:245}} some QoL changes to make his laning phase better?! Like **increasing his auto attack range** from 125 to 150 (like {{champion:131}} and {{champion:38}} ) or 175 (like {{champion:517}},{{champion:157}} and {{champion:105}}) would be much appreciated. I know most assassins have usually 125 AA range, but Ekko isn't really a fully fledged assassin (_despite being classified as one, by Riot_). Maybe when he gets 3 items and he's ahead? But even then one could easily argue! Because Ekko doesn't really excel at being an assassin or at being a mage fighter. He can do both decently enough but _**he excels at neither of them**_. He's something in between, like _**50% assassin + 50% fighter/diver**_, not a pure assassin like {{champion:238}} {{champion:91}} {{champion:28}}, etc.\n\nOne of the most frustrating things with Ekko is having to wait until we get 90+ AP, **and** having to be **lvl 9** (_rank 5 Q_), to finally be able to one shot the backline minions safely and get farm consistently. Ekko has a very hard time against most meta mid champions, **whether they're S or A tier**, because of their ability to easily poke him down and/or sustain any damage he does. Most of the time, you'll never see an Ekko even in cs, or ahead in cs, the whole early game. Why? Because his early damage sucks (_**especially to minions**_) and he needs to fulfill specific requirements (_90+ AP and lvl 9_) to be able to farm in lane and stay relevant in the game.\n\n**==>** A small buff to his Q's damage (especially Q1) would be very welcomed, so he can stay relevant in lane and have an easier time farming under those harsh circumstances when facing those poke/sustain heavy champions. You can even just give him some specific damage to minions, if you want to, since his damage to champions is already balanced and fair enough. Something like that, you get the idea!\n\nTo put things into perspective, Ekko wasn't buffed for almost 3 years now. The last **significant buff** he received was in [patch 6.22](https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/V6.22), on November 10th, 2016:\n\n>Stats\n* Base mana regeneration increased to 7 from 6.\n>\nZ-Drive Resonance (P)\n* REMOVED: Slowing enemy champions.\n* Base damage changed to 30 − 140 (based on level) from 20 − 190 (based on level).\n>\nTimewinder (Q)\n* AP ratio increased to 30% AP from 20% AP.\n* NEW EFFECT: Radius increases by 50 as it hovers by the end of its travel distance, returning to normal while it travels back to Ekko.\n>\nChronobreak (R)\n* Healing ratio changed to 60% AP from 20% (+ 6% per 100 AP) of health recently lost.\n* NEW EFFECT: Heal is increased by 3% for every 1% of his maximum health lost over the last 4 seconds.\n* NEW EFFECT: If Ekko's blink-back takes him through Parallel Convergence Parallel Convergence, he will trigger the effect.\n\n_**(RIP passive, btw!)**_\n\nCome on, Riot, even {{champion:245}} himself is getting sick and tired of waiting for new buffs:\n\n\" _Come on! Show me something new!_ \"\n\" _Things aren't gonna' improve themselves._ \"","replies":[{"poster":"Wiented","date":"2019-08-04T03:00:00.654+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"Ekko is not weak by any means tbh. I think all champs should have at least 150 range, but there is no reason why Ekko should have more than standard melee. I agree with Q buff though.

I'm just saying that his laning phase sucks ass and his early damage is a little bit on the weak side, compared to his fellow assassins and/or fighters.\n\nHe just needs a little bit of help, just a small push, to make his laning phase better and compete with the other mid laners!","replies":[{"poster":"The Ecdysiast","date":"2019-08-04T04:22:10.474+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"But he doesn't.

I don't think that would break him, especially since later in the game you're generally not going to be getting that many passive procs off on champions unless you go with some sort of attack speed build and even then it's not a guarantee. Even if they halved the current CD for jungle monsters, I'd be happy with that. \n\n\nOther than that, I like him how he is.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-08-04T04:48:51.734+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I don't think you understand the meaning of \"quality-of-life change.\" Such changes aren't direct increases to a champion's power, but instead make them feel better to play. For example, today I saw a suggestion on Boards to allow Garen players to ping his passive and indicate to his team that he's regenerating health and will be ready for more action shortly. That doesn't make Garen stronger, it's just a more straightforward way for players to communicate about their abilities. A 40% increase in autoattack range isn't a QoL change, it's just a buff. Adding damage to a spell so a champion can waveclear more easily and quickly at an earlier level isn't a QoL change, it's just a buff.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Laçez","date":"2019-08-07T15:46:16.924+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just stopped playing him after realising there is literally no point cucking urself playing an underwhelming champion that is albeit, pretty fun but useless or outclassed by a variety of champions. \nI tried to stick with him (racked up over 500k) but he's just not worth it. It sucks the life out of me because there are diminishing returns for almost everything you do in his kit &amp; there is no real way to buff him without breaking him so I'll just see if they change his kit in any fashion in the future...
