They seem to pop up in the shop rotation a lot more than Swain and Kayle, with {{champion:21}} and {{champion:30}} being somewhat present, but not as often as Anivia and Yasuo!\r\n\r\nHowever, I've also noticed that the opposite happens for the carrousel rounds. It seems, to me, that Swain and Kayle are the most frequent 5 cost units that show up in the carrousel rounds, mid to late game. By contrast, in my experience, the least frequent unit in the carrousel is Karthus and MF.\r\n\r\nI know that this is my own experience with the game and other people might have noticed otherwise. But I'm pretty curious to know how often you guys see the 5 cost units in the shop and in the carrousel.\r\n\r\nWhich ones are the most frequent and which ones are the least frequent, in your own games?","replies":[{"poster":"Re4p3rr","date":"2019-08-29T15:13:43.141+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The rarest of every unit is the one you need for your comp","replies":[]},{"poster":"Illabethe","date":"2019-08-26T04:03:02.482+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think they're about the same. The difference in feel probably comes from the fact that EVERY player WANTS Kayle. Swain SOME want.\n\nMost don't want or have room for the others.\n\nSo, while 2 players have already bought Kayle and you're still looking for yours, the MF/Yasuo/Karthus are still around in the shop. Sometimes even 4-5 Kayles have been purchased by the time you're seeking yours ( One player getting a 2 star takes 3 of 13 out of circulation).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pyrrhicblade","date":"2019-08-27T18:10:18.767+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't put it past Riot to \"soft fix\" popular strats by messing with rarity and pool sizes.

I've likewise played hundreds of games, and noticed the exact same trend.  It's not just about confirmation bias, either, as far as I can tell, as I've played so many types of comps that I've been on the other side of the coin.  When I've looked for Kayles, I struggle to find even 2, but when I want a Yas, I get 7-8???  I legit played blademasters for a while for this reason alone, and never struggled to get a level 2 Yas.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Anotherherolost","date":"2019-08-26T16:13:39.551+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It probably is the fact that more than one person is always going nobles so the chances that someone leveled up earlier than you and got her before they needed her are pretty high. I def agree that I see Yas more than any of them but I think that's for the same reason. I so rarely see people going Blademasters so early on you probably pass him up when you roll into him.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BeatzBoyFTW","date":"2019-08-26T12:59:01.996+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Never seen a Tier 2 Swain in my life, but I've seen Tier 2 Kayle a couple of times.\n\nRNG's a bitch, and Riot chooses to have a Ranked system BASED ON THAT.","replies":[{"poster":"Shmeeve","date":"2019-08-26T15:00:25.957+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=BeatzBoyFTW,realm=NA,application-id=RaE1aOE7,discussion-id=1VcfJxn7,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2019-08-26T12:59:01.996+0000)\n>\n> Never seen a Tier 2 Swain in my life, but I've seen Tier 2 Kayle a couple of times.\n> \n> RNG's a bitch, and Riot chooses to have a Ranked system BASED ON THAT.\n\nI have had a tier 2 swain once, with a gunblade... and Morel...\nOnce he ults it's game over.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Tizull","date":"2019-08-26T12:57:14.827+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Time to go look up how RNGs work and how probability works.
