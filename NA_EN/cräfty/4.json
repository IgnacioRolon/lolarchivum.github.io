She can power up its range, Attack Damage, and Crit chance over time by absorbing Mist from enemy champions she's attacking or from wraiths that spawn from dead enemies.","url":"https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/champions-skins/champion-preview/senna-abilities","image":"https://na.leagueoflegends.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_medium/public/upload/senna_abilities_header.jpg?itok=O0lNm_xX"},"up_votes":5,"down_votes":17,"body":"So, Senna is the new Support/Marksman Riot Games is releasing.\n\nFirst of all, yes, she is supposed to be able to be played as both Support **and** Marksman. She's not a pure support. That's why her passive gives her ADC stats. Let's hope the numbers and scaling are kept in check and balanced before she hits the live server.\n\nSecond, Her Q seems to rely on hitting an allied target to work. From all the footage available so far, we can see that everytime she casts her Q, she either casts it through an allied champion ({{champion:236}}), an allied ward (when she killed{{champion:40}} and {{champion:84}}) or a turret. Maybe she can cast it through allied minions as well, but no footage of that yet. So basically, her Q might be an exact copy of Lucian's Q, but casted on allies (including allied turrets and wards) rather than enemies. It's not a free to use skillshot, it's conditioned by different factors that I just mentioned, including your own positioning in fights.\n\nHer W is ok, I guess. The initial hit by it doesn't apply any soft CC prior to the hard CC (root) right after. And the root doesn't seem to last that long. So Tenacity might make this ability way less impactful. Let's not forget about cleanse-like abilities as well. Yes, it's an AoE hard CC, but it pushes the enemy to position better during fights, that's it. Think of it as playing vs a {{champion:26}} that's trying to poke you with his Q (kinda). If your teammate has Senna's W on him, stay away from him.\n\nThe E is a bit scary, tbh, but it doesn't seem to be as broken as people think. There seems to be counter play potential to this:\n\n* Senna is always at the center of her E. So you know where to aim your skillshots vs her.\n* Senna's movement is visible. Even though she is stealthed, you can clearly see where and how she's moving. Think of it as {{champion:555}}'s W, but now you can actually see where he's going and at what speed, all the the time.\n* Senna is still targetable by skillshots (hooked by thresh).\n* Allies and Senna are **camouflaged**, not invisible. Which means they can be revealed by many ways: step in close to them, {{item:2055}}, turrets, or any ability that grant unit-vision.\n* The current description says that allies are **unclickable**, not untargetable. Which means you can still hit them with AoE and skillshot abilities ({{champion:498}} got hit by {{champion:5}}'s W while she was in Senna's E).\n\nHer ult seems to be the only ability that can be considered OP, for now. A global {{champion:136}} beam that simply deals damage in the center of it and shields allies with a wilder range. We'll see how \" broken \" this will be on PBE soon anyway.\n\nSo yeah, overall, I think the abilities are pretty decent. I'm just hoping her passive doesn't give too much stats and her R doesn't deal too much damage (the shield seems fine atm).","replies":[{"poster":"Zerenza","date":"2019-10-29T20:53:45.201+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"The only issue i have is her E. I can't think of a single moment where an entire enemy team being Unclickable and/or stealthed is fair. We learned from akali that even if you can see the champion, if you can't click on them it's still just as annoying and hard to play against as them being invisible.\n\nWhat's more is the fact that not only does her Camo not go away when she takes damage or is CCed, her Camo won't go away if her allies cast abilities from her E either meaning that the enemy team can throw skillshots at you from a place where you can't see them while also being able to move themselves. \n\nI don't know why making allied champions Unclickable while also giving an entire team stealth was necessary, giving an entire team stealth was plenty but to make it impossible to force the enemy team out of that stealth while also making them unclickable is downright broken. If senna can have her Fog canceled with Damage and CC and the Unclickable mechanic is removed, by all means she's a great champion but otherwise it's broken and it's going to be impossible to balance.","replies":[{"poster":"Cräfty","date":"2019-10-29T21:22:10.499+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"I can understand your point but I also think of it from the other side too. If the enemy team is packed inside that small area of Senna's E, my team can combo them easily with AoE abilities and skillshots. Don't forget that although that ability grants AoE camouflage, it limits your allies' movement within that tight space and limits the type of plays that they can do from there, since once they attack, they are revealed and can't stealth back (supposedly). So, their movement becomes predictable and what they can do from there becomes even more predictable.\n\nIf Senna herself becomes clickable again after being damaged inside her E, then the ability becomes 100% useless, that's why there is only a small window where becomes clickable again when she attacks, and then she recamoufle again.\n\nYes, unclickable enemies sucks ass. But, as long as they can still be hit by skillshots, I'm fine with it. Not like {{champion:350}}, where not only you can't click on her, you can't even hit her with anything. Now, THAT is broken!","replies":[{"poster":"Zerenza","date":"2019-10-29T21:26:05.328+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"They do not get revealed when they attack so long as the remain inside of her camo, that's why it's an issue, even if they did get revealed they just re stealth and as we know, again, from akali that's still really frustrating. \n\nThe ability is far from useless if she reveals herself when attacked, all it means is she'll have to play it like all other champions with Camo have to, you gotta dodge man. I main evelynn, i understand the strength of camo and i would LOVE if getting hit or CC'ed didn't break my Camo, it's broken strong to not get revealed from those things.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"BBKong","date":"2019-10-29T21:10:40.097+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Her using Qs on wards is an incredible catch actually, I had to rewatch it to go check and she does indeed only use Q on allies and even wards and Qs the ward to kill enemies. I think they'll need to slightly rework her E and maybe make the R not global but around ziggs or lux ult range, and I'd be fine with her then. Can be a really cool champion.\n\nAlso, they need to be VERY careful about how they balance her passive, or people will build her pure ADC and just take the bonus stats from it and be stupid strong.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Doge2020","date":"2019-10-29T21:02:42.872+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":10,"body":"Her Q is just a skillshot it doesn’t need an ally or enemy to cast.

To kill akali and kill the janna after, in BOTH clips, she places a ward down and then Qs the ward. She also is Qing the tower itself as it's an \"ally\". It can't be a coincidence because of the wards being placed down and then being Q'd on twice.","replies":[{"poster":"Doge2020","date":"2019-10-29T21:14:10.898+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hmm guess I was wrong\n\nI would honestly prefer it if Senna’s Q was a skillshot rather than a point and click ability, it would just flow much better to me and it can be used in more situations IMO","replies":[{"poster":"Cräfty","date":"2019-10-29T21:29:48.454+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The Q being a point-and-click ability that works only on allied units/turrets/wards forces her into the supportive role more, which is Riot's intent anyway.

Going tank allows you to survive in lane, and scale to the point where you straight up out damage and out range a full damage adc. Plus the fact you also get crit and lifesteal, making it only necessary to get pen items.

He can still be killed by DOTs or stuff like 2nd hit of leblanc E, etc, so invulnerable doesn't work. But he can't be hit by abilities either. Unclickable means you can still get hit by non-point-and-click abilities, meanwhile champs with \"untargetable\" can only get hit by things with no projectile like leblanc/ignite if they were targeted with it beforehand. Same with Vladimir pool \n\nOh, and Ekko is different because his ult states that he's both untargetable and invulnerable.\n\nEdit: I had a brainfart and forgot Fizz can dodge karthus ult, but the leblanc and ignite examples still stand along with stuff like fiddle drain.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Zeta 1313","date":"2019-10-29T21:15:46.605+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Nope, it has been stated that it is different.\n\n\nAlso, SKILLSHOTS","replies":[]}]}]}
