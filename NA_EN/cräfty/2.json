Somehow, in the buff formula, there is an unnecessary multiplication of the current AS that is messing up the actual **double** value of AS that should be given to Rangers. Afterall, when a buff literally says that it **doubles** the AS of Rangers, it should mean literally it makes the current AS of those units **exactly twice** the current amount.\n\nIt' not rocket science, it's simple math:\n\n* **AS^2 + AS** , or **AS x (1 + AS)**, is not equal to **2 x AS**.\n\nBut, I see a lot of people who are convinced that the **AS^2 + AS**, or **AS x (1 + AS)**, formula is the intended way Riot wants Ranger buff to work.\n\nIf Riot intended for the formula to work the way they described, then they should update the Ranger buff from:\n\n* Rangers gain a chance to **double** their attack speed every 3s for the next 3s.\n\nto:\n\n* Rangers gain a chance to **increase** their attack speed every 3s for the next 3s.\n\nThat would be more accurate, in that case, and less confusing. But, personally, I strongly believe that this is a bug.\n\nAlso, some people say that attack speed works \" _multiplicatively_ \" since a bunch of patches ago. To them, I say that I checked all patch notes from 9.14 to 9.17 (current patch). None of them has ever stated that the Ranger buff itself (not the proc chance) was changed in any shape or form. So idk what they're talking about.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- **EDIT** ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI finally figured out what's going on with the AS calculations.\n\nI totally forgot that, in [patch 9.14](https://euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/teamfight-tactics-patch-914-notes#patch-systems), they changed how AS ratios work. So I was looking in the wrong direction.\n\nSo in that patch, they implemented this:\n\n> Attack Speed Changes\n* We've changed all champions' attack speed ratios so that attack speed bonuses are now calculated based on a percent of the champion's base attack speed. In short, champions with lower base attack speeds will receive less benefit from attack speed items. Certain champions and attack speed granting items have been adjusted in this patch to compensate.\n>\n* Champion Attack Speed Ratios: 1.0 ⇒ champion base attack speed\n\nNow the calculations, that other people told me about, make sense. For those who, like me, were confused, here is how it works:\n\nSo, normally, when you double the Attack Speed, you do this:\n\n* AS + AS x ratio.\n\nSince, normally, the ratio = 1, then:\n\n* AS + AS x 1 = AS x (1 + 1) = 2 x AS.\n\nWhich is logical, since having a ratio of 1 makes calculations simpler and easier to do.\n\nBut Riot changed that ratio to, now, being the **base Attack Speed** (I'm calling it **bAS**) itself. Probably to nerf the power of some items and units, and especially to end the dictatorship of {{champion:106}} carry.\n\nSo the normal ratio of \" 1 \" became a new ratio of \" bAS \". If we go back to the previous formula of doubling the AS, and change the \" 1 \" with \" bAS \", we get:\n\n* **AS + AS x bAS = AS x (1 + bAS)**\n\nSo when we replace the bAS by an example of 0.7, which is the bAS of {{champion:22}} {{champion:110}} {{champion:67}}, and since, with no items, **AS = bAS**, when doubling the AS, we get this:\n\n* AS + AS x bAS = **bAS + bAS x bAS** = 0.7 + 0.7 x 0.7 = 1.19\n\nSo, in the end, what was confusing me, and everyone who found 1.19 weird, since it's not 0.7 x 2, is that the AS ratio was not 1, but 0.7 (the bAS of those 3 Rangers).\n\nOh, and for {{champion:203}}, since her bAS = 0.65, without even looking in game, her \" doubled \" AS, by the Ranger buff, should be:\n\n* 0.65 + 0.65 x 0.65 = 1.0725\n\nI hope that, now, it's clear why the values of \" **_doubled_** \" AS of Rangers **are not exactly double** the value that they had before the buff kicks in.\n\nIf a new Ranger comes to TFT, with a bAS  = 1.00, then when he's buffed by Ranger buff, he will have exactly double the value of his AS. But until then, every Ranger will have a \"_doubled_\" AS that is less than twice the value of his AS, since all Rangers have a bAS &lt; 1.00.\n\nGod, what a mess you made here, Riot... what a mess! All of this because you fucked up with {{champion:106}} big time...\n\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-clap}}","replies":[{"poster":"Porglit","date":"2019-08-28T16:24:14.785+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I believe the change happened when they switched from AS being a flat increase to it being an increase based on BASE attack speed.

I just went back to check all patches to find the AS changes and it seems that in [patch 9.14](https://euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/teamfight-tactics-patch-914-notes#patch-systems) they did this:\n\n> Attack Speed Changes\n* We've changed all champions' attack speed ratios so that attack speed bonuses are now calculated based on a percent of the champion's base attack speed.

Now I understand what's happening, mathematically speaking.\n\nI'm gonna edit my thread to explain what's actually happening. Thanks for reminding me of this.\n\nGod, what a mess!\n\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-clap}}","replies":[]}]}]}
