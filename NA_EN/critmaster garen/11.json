Around level 6, both enchants give the same amount of Health (while Cinderhulk gives more lategame health). 10% CDR might help clears, but so does the immolate damage - youd have a hard time getting more than 1 rotation off in a gank with her long cooldowns, even with 10% more CDR. Tenacity? Sure - ill give you that Elise likes tenacity, but so does every other jungler who thrives in the Cinderhulk meta. \n___________________________________________________________\n\nIts not good on fiddle for the same reason that lich bane isnt good on fiddle. Magus gives fiddle 2 things he needs, AP and CDR. RuneGlaive gives less CDR, and has a autoattack passive for a non-autoattacking jungler. His base attack speed and autoattack animation are so slow that if you can chain-drain someone instead, the time it takes to autoattack and get the RuneGlaive proc (around 1 attack per second doing 70 + 30% AP lategame) would do less damage than the drain (1 second does an extra 80 + 45% AP). And thats not taking into account that fiddle's auto range is shorter than the drain range (and much shorter than the channel range). \n\nIt might help his clears, but fiddle doesnt need help in clears. He doesnt even need chilling smite, opening the door for blasting smite, since his Fear has a very similar range to smite. \n\nFiddle has been **THE ** AP carry jungler for a long time.

It's better to add a ratio to the vast majority of kits than it is to add 40 AP and 10% CDR. Fid's the only AP jungler I can think of who has major problems procing the spellblade effect in fights.\n\n>Elise likes tenacity, but so does every other jungler who thrives in the Cinderhulk meta.\n\nSej and Gragas both give 0 fucks about tenacity. If I have my W running as Sej and you CC me you just accomplished nothing. You also just wasted your CC onto a target you can't focus down and most likely lost the fight. That's not to say that they can't use it, more just that it makes very little difference to them.\n\nComparatively Elise needs to AA in order to do damage, when she's CC'd she can't AA.\n\nThe point I'm making is that we're both talking about a single champ.

Bruiser junglers preferred Juggernaut for the tenacity and certain but the tanks had major clear speed issues so the sunfire passive was added simply to improve that, over toned at first but in a good spot now. Similarly AP junglers are having clear and sustain problems which this item will help with.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"diamondlight","date":"2015-06-14T03:21:29.635+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I played Runeglaive on {{champion:60}}  Elise on PBE and it was actually quite nice. I did wish I had more AP from it and the 20% CDR instead of 10, but it increased my overall clear times and DPS. It also helped with waveclear on either a successful gank or covering a lane during a recall (or respawn). One caveat though! Elise has some new changes to her kit on PBE as well that also might have been contributing significantly, it really is an improvement on her. Hard to separate the two, but I did like Runeglaive on her because she is so AA heavy.\n\nI feel like there should be something at the Sheen level as far as mana regen. It does kind of suck to have to wait for full jungle item to get that component (IE make it more like Bami Cinder -> Cinderhulk). Because of this, It doesn't help that much in early levels, it's really just the Sapphire Crystal part of sheen, which you can buy anyway. It's really the early levels where mana problems tend to occur the most. I pretty much was semi-forced into a Trailblazer path for the sustain, and then I wasn't sure how much Runeglaive was contributing, or just Trailblazer.\n\n{{champion:154}} Zac: Both Cinderhulk and Magus are viable on him, one for extra tankiness, the other for CDR and being probably the only AP item he buys (except maybe Liandry), of course if you snowball, you might build more (Rylai for instance). Runeglaive won't be viable on him at all, because he isn't a real Lich Bane candidate and Runeglaive even weaker. He doesn't build enough AP to justify it. So then, that leaves him with only one build path, Cinderhulk, reducing the diversity.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TotalJerk","date":"2015-06-14T03:04:00.258+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was wondering about this.

Magus is getting replaced because it's an overall lackluster item, one that does nothing to answer the difficulties AP champions face in the jungle (namely mana sustain) and doesn't scale as well as it should into the late game, and while Runeglaive is good on champions like {{champion:131}}, {{champion:245}} and even {{champion:60}}, it's also one that isn't really the best fit for mages, with {{champion:9}} being the biggest outlier (he doesn't really benefit that much from current jungle items either, though), and unlike {{item:3725}}, which is universally beneficial to tanky champions in and out of the jungle, Runeglaive is likely to not have that much of an impact outside of clears, bar really autoattack-focused champions (even Elise doesn't make the best use of it when in combat with champions). I think the answer shouldn't be to have two separate AP enchantments, but rather to look for a single AP enchantment that relies more on spells, which would greatly benefit mages, obviously, but also likely help out even really autoattack-based AP junglers. Spell power is the defining trait of pretty much any AP champion, so I feel it would make sense to have the AP jungler enchantment build on that, rather than just provide raw stats, as is the case for Magus, or focus on spell-weaving and autoattacks, which Runeglaive currently does.","replies":[{"poster":"CrazedPorcupine","date":"2015-06-14T08:18:01.210+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The best thing to do would actually to add a jungle enchant that functioned like a mini deathcap.\n\nSomething like this\nEnchantment: Scroll of Knowledge\nRecipe: Ancient Tome + Forbidden Idol + 365 gold = 1400 (same as all other enchantments)\n10% CDR\n40 AP\nUnique Passive - Expanded Knowledge: Increase ability power by 15%\nUnique passive - Soul Siphon: Regain 4% of damage dealt with abilities to neutral monsters as mana","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ibeturgood","date":"2015-06-14T03:45:50.286+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So instead of having a jungle item used by 3 champions that want a jungle item used by 5 champions, nice idea Riot!","replies":[]},{"poster":"FistOfSharkiesha","date":"2015-06-14T00:11:50.720+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not sure why melee gets 2 straight up offensive items and 1 tank item and mage junglers are stuck with the scraps.","replies":[]},{"poster":"XeroKimo","date":"2015-06-13T23:50:44.511+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd agree with this, this is like my devvourer and warrior enchancement for ads, do I want the attack speed, or the bonus ad and armor pent, making it like do I want more damage, or more auto reliant, it's the same, using skills to be more auto reliant as an ap jungler or more skill damage reliant","replies":[]},{"poster":"OyddAWqJ5r","date":"2015-06-13T21:48:18.741+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay someone better post that goddam Mexican commercial gif right now.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DeBeers Only","date":"2015-06-13T15:47:47.623+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Crittlesticks master race boys","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ataraxas","date":"2015-06-13T15:05:03.105+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:77}} I WANT MUH JUGGERNAUT BACK AS WELL","replies":[]},{"poster":"Silents429","date":"2015-06-13T15:04:57.997+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"The same reason we didn't keep both Juggernaut and Cinderhulk","replies":[]}]}
