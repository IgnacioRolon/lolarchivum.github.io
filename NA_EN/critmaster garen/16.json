He is more like a strict niche, and even then, you have other options.\n\nyea, no. thats exactly the problem.\n\nlike i said, the champion needs actual work. i dont think a bandaid buff to his w so he can survive a few more lanes is enough, because he doesnt scale up to be able to carry just by surviving.\n\nthe only way garen carries with his current kit is to get ahead in lane, and not just even. with an early game that gets him bullied by kayle, this isnt going to be possible.\n\nwith an early game like this they need to either seriously tune up his scaling, so he ends up at the same end of the power spectrum as lategame carries (like kayle, fiora, veigar, nasus etc.), or they need to allow him to be a lane bully again (like renekton), if he falls off later.\n\nbut hes not going to be a functioning champion with a weak early game, and weak lategame. and just surviving his weak early game to end up at a weak lategame wont do anything for him either. because when you chose to max out w, or at least put more points into it, you dfont put them into your offense and have even less kill pressure.","replies":[{"poster":"Saevum","date":"2019-03-31T13:56:45.283+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Critmaster Garen,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=KZbbcNaZ,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2019-03-31T13:34:11.826+0000)\n>\n> but hes not going to be a functioning champion with a weak early game, and weak lategame.\n\nYou got the answer already here.\n\nIf you want to dig in a possible mini-rework solution, I would aim for his signature aspects:\n\n1. I would give his passive a mini-tweak stacking rework. Which would consist in increasing the healing by %10 for every tick that your E proc'd on champions (for 5 seconds) after the passive is off cooldown. And diminish the time the passive is on cooldown by the same amount. This would help him in the early trades without breaking him.\n\nSame scenario with Kayle: go in, trade, Q into E, back off. Heal better after the trade. Counterplay from kayle perspective: keep your passive on cooldown as always has been.\n\n2. Change to his E. for every tick of judgement stacked on the enemy champions (only) your passive increases healing by 10%. For every champion hit, the heal will double, and will be off cooldown for 10 seconds (lets try 10 seconds first). This would help him when engaging in a teamfight and if by chance he manages to hit at least 2 enemy champions while he spins.\n\nSame scenario with kayle: go in, trade, Q into E, enemy jungler jumps in, you hit them both with E, passive goes off cooldown instead of being in cooldown and increases healing by double for 10 seconds, pop W while you are at it, you might survive longer to hug the turret.\n\nI am just sketching at this point, feel free to suggest to Riot a FULL rework.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Galaxyburstz","date":"2019-03-31T14:01:11.527+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm all for buffing health and survivability stats this season, but not on

there used to be crit on {{item:3142}}  \n\n2 but his q e trade at level two with resolve is pretty good since your opponent is silenced for most of the duration [ maybe not good enough ]\n\n3 trash early game + falls off mid game = midgame powerspike, so now they are buffing his in lane trading power, since a champion shouldn't necessarily be good at all aspects of the game at every stage they are sacrificing his late game for his early game\n\n4 don't pick him into ranged tops with mobility and expect good results lol [ you know this ]\n\n5  fewer games reach the late stage this season so that W buff is much better than a straight up scaling buff\n\n6 with vayne this meta I remember watching a garen get shredded by her and man did I feel bad for him\n\n7 I agree with you but am just
