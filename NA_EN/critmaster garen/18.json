They can all use this item effectively, but it is not a core item for all of them.\n\nFor {{champion:121}} specifically, I think that this is a core item, because unlike most AD assassins, he doesn't benefit a lot from {{item:3142}} (Kha'Zix already has a lot of natural sticking power and the attack speed and crit are wasted, he is by far the least AA-reliant AD assassin), also, his burst is lower and more conditional when compared to other AD assassins. He needs to stay on combat for a longer time, thus, the HP from The Black Cleaver benefits him a lot. Also, he really likes when he is able to max CDR.\n\nHowever, for other AD assassins like {{champion:107}} {{champion:238}} {{champion:91}} this is not a core item. It is still an optional item for them, but they don't really need the extra HP from The Black Cleaver, also, they really benefit from {{item:3142}}. They have the freedom to focus on squishier builds when compared to Kha'Zix, due to their overall burst being higher.\n\nI didn't mentioned {{champion:114}} {{champion:64}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:11}} {{champion:92}} because it is extremely debatable whether they are assassins or fighters. That said, with the exception of Yasuo, they can all use The Black Cleaver effectively, too.

Same with Annie. Spring Split was arguably just as bad for tanks when it was literally stack a bunch of CC monster tanks on your team and win since your goal was to make their team go afk through stun locks while still doing a large amount of damage. \n> \n> I am not denying the fact that these ADC changes are a bit extreme and will probably get nerfed but it has been a very long time since ADC were the penultimate role on the rift where Juggermaw comps were a viable strategy.\n\nHowever, baring Morde... it's the one role that is 100% required in every team comp.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Auz the Ripper","date":"2015-11-02T05:55:41.898+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=My Waifu Chocola,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=tsivOLmI,comment-id=0000000000010000,timestamp=2015-11-02T04:50:14.689+0000)\n>\n>  Metas are defined by who shits on ADCs more and they are always the target of oppression. \n\nIf the Meta is always defined by ADC, that means they've alway been the most important.\nThere's never been a meta where you can go without a Marksman except maybe Beta/season 1 and that one weird patch with Rengar.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Ultraboomer","date":"2015-11-01T21:32:39.615+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"Let me start by saying that any and all AD champions will benefit from the new maw passive.
