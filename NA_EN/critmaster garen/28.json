can now easily remove those things from outside bushes was a gigantic nerf for her. for some reason shes the only one who gets this treatment.\n\nyou dont see heimer turrets from outside bushes until

him and not an argument.\n\nranged champions can easily take tentacles out in a matter of 2 seconds by poking at them. its not harder for them to take out a tentacle than it is to destroy a barrel.\n\nplus, if you read through the thread i said in both cases they dont need to be targetable. they went too far with allowing people to attack those tentacles without direct vision. going by

Gangplank does the same thing it's just that he actually needs to be able to do that, he's extremely squishy and his laning phase is bad so being able to place things in a bush give him an extra edge.\n\nIf anything you should learn tendencies of certain champions and understand what they're doing. Illaoi placing tentacles in a bush is very common, same with gangplank and his barrels. \n\nMulti-Hits or not it's a valid strategy that the opponent should learn to play around.\n\nPS: Chances are if you tried to fight an illaoi and she started running, she was going to kill you anyway, she just chose to run back to part of the lane that she had control over.
