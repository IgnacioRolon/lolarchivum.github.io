Each Tier is supposed to represent a MMR range or it has no relation to skill or a MMR system.\n\nMaking a slightly lower MMR range for say Iron 4 comparative to B5 is doable... but its not really helping much with any ladder quality. Your bottom of the ladder tier should be a good 1-2 class intervals of MMR from the average player.\n\nIn an Elo system off logistical distribution that's something in the ball park of Probability expectations of 76% or 91%.  So your B5/Iron 4 Players? Assuming only 200-400 or so \"Elo\" points your expectations are 3 to 1 lowest and scale up to 9 to 1 odds to fail vs the \"average\" Player.\n\nyou don't see a lot of positive gains trying to account for things that start being class intervals below your \"bad\" players.  Mostly because its easy to play to lose so your not really to worried about how a highly precise rating for \"bad\" as its low effort to fail.\n\nThen the new tiers have to get rebalanced to represent wider MMR ranges?  Honestly.... in that case if the goal is to shift ladder to remove population from the very bottom..\n\nMaking a few divisions near the center represent a larger range then prior seasons could work... but it also would add more chaos to duo queing as the skill gaps between lower end and higher end \"Tiers\" are at a higher inaccuracy.\n\nI read a few of the dev articles but don't really recall any talking about # of players stuck at b5 as an issue. Shoot me a link if you have one for that. I am curious about the topic.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Thingamajig","date":"2019-06-07T08:42:23.570+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"there would be a stronger argument to make it for

how many games they lost.\n\nas a result, the division (just bronze 5) used to be gigantic in its player count, and bronze last season was basically split up into iron and bronze this season. at best, you could make an argument that it made silver slightly harder to reach this season if last seasons silver 5 was included in forming bronze this season. but the addition of iron tier had no effect on the mmr ranges of gold and above, while shoving grandmaster infront of challenger lowered the average mmr ranges of the divisions below (up to bronze) slightly.\n\nthis was all explained in a dev blog during preseason.\n\ngrandmaster was added, because of the gigantic skill gap between diamond 5 and diamond 1, to make a more clear cut in that division and turn d1 and d2 + low lp masters together into the new master divison.\n\niron tier was split off bronze, because bronze 5 was gigantic.\n\ni think earning the victorious skin should at least feel a little bit like an accomplishment instead

achievement especially for people that are way above gold\nbut for people that struggle to get out of silver telling them \"this season you have to try to get to plat instead\" would be like a knee to the gut for them\nand this would increase the demand for boosting services and in turn make plat even a bigger shitfest than it already is\nand with that low diamond would be insanely stupid\n\nso
