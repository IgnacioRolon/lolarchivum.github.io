His Q size nerf and 25 range reduction is a pretty big nerf to him from a while back since it's harder to land his Q on champ(seriously sometimes the bomb just bounce over their head). His wave clear early game without item is pretty terrible and cost a significant amount of mana.\n\nBaron buff is also a pretty big indirect nerf to him as well because he can't wave clear against baron buffed minions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fondling Gems","date":"2016-05-23T17:56:10.151+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Immobile mage that has no real way to deal with divers","replies":[{"poster":"Critmaster Garen","date":"2016-05-23T18:45:01.007+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Fondling Gems,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=4vBA9KMk,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-05-23T17:56:10.151+0000)\n>\n> Immobile mage that has no real way to deal with divers\n\nsatchel charge and minefields?\n\nits gonna get rough against someone like vi, but he isnt completely helpless against most.","replies":[{"poster":"Fondling Gems","date":"2016-05-23T19:19:04.089+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Vi, xin, zed, yasuo, talon.
