But it's not IID. It can't. If someone has an exp/gold/position advantage _before_ that influences the probability _now_. So if you have a \"hit\" then you not only get a value returned but also an increased chance of another hit. It's not going to ever be 100%, but the more you get, the more skewed towards you it is.\n\nBut then if the probability of a hit is always changing and also skewed towards favoring the previous outcome, then what you get in the expected behavior is extreme volatility OR a straight slope to victory depending on how much the parameter changes based on the previous outcome.\n\nWhy am I getting into the nitty gritty of this theoretical distribution that represents the probability of a win for a given side with given history in that game? Because I think you're judging your teammate's play with the expectations that if they were at least competent, then it would remain even and/or go back and forth tit for tat.\n\nThat isn't remotely the norm. Your streak of \"terrible\" players are almost certainly just players your skill level and their exhibiting behavior that is mathematically expected but doesn't meet your expectations of an average player is why you are thereby labelling them as terrible in the first place.\n\nWhy does this always happen in your promos? Because you only notice it in your promos. That and because the enemy is slightly skewed in their favor so that if you win your promos, the system is confident that you actually belong there. The slight skew makes the game harder and thus more likely to be volatile or a complete stomp for the enemy.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Yfrappefort","date":"2015-09-12T20:45:39.023+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Koldheartedjsp,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=dEcKKP1o,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-09-12T09:48:20.946+0000)\n>\n> idk if it's rito or the law of large numbers but every so often i notice my match history is all red or all green\n\nThis is exactly happening to me as well.

You can stuffed with 4 other players. You have no control over who they are besides that they're in your ELO range. Sometimes you will get idiots, sometimes you will get really good players. Sometimes your teammates decide to AFK/troll/pick shitty comps/etc. Sometimes the enemy team will do so.\n\nI'm trying to say that luck is a big factor in these games.

I never see players like that when my win rate drops below 50%, that's for sure.\n\nLet's take a look at your match history and see whether it's right or not. I will consider 4 games won/lost in a row a 'streak'. I will look at every game AFTER your streak. If you are right that's when the effect should kick in.\n\nSo your first winstreak was 5 days ago. It broke in your Lulu game.\nYour team elo: plat 5, plat 3, gold 2, plat 4 and gold1 (you) vs plat 5, gold 1, plat 5, plat 5 and gold 1.\n\nYour toplane won according to damage dealt and farm but probably lost due to the pressure of her team losing.\nYour mid won HARD and tried to carry the game.\nYour jungle lost hard\nAnd the reason why you lost the game is that you lost Lulu + Draven vs Braum + Vayne.\nBut while Draven still managed to get a halfdecent KDA you place less wards then Braum, cleared less wards and had a smaller kill participation. You also died a lot which may be due to the fact that you built Rabadons while losing the game. \n\nSo your lane losing actually lost the game even though the average elo of your team was higher than the average elo of the enemy team.\nYour experience is rather subjective, but if you'd take an objective look at your games you'd realize that it's very often not your teams fault that you lose and certainly not Riots.\nI took a look at a lot of games that broke your winstreakes - the elo of both teams was incredibly even.","replies":[{"poster":"HalcyonDweller","date":"2015-09-13T07:19:17.655+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Whoah, can I get you to analyze my games?

If you were to look at my latest MF game, I got CONSISTENTLY visited by the enemy team for literally the entirety of my laning phase. I stopped counting at five ganks, and it seemed like they were targeting me on purpose for WHATEVER reason (even when I left that lane and went mid, the enemy jg found me and tower-dove me mid). I'm saying that there's times where team mates hold you back repeatedly. You can't say it doesn't happen cause it's all chance based on who you're matched with, how comfortable they are with the character they may or may not have wanted to pick, and the enemy and their situation. It's not easy chalking it all up to one person absolutely in a team game.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"HEAljvLykd","date":"2015-09-12T14:53:39.477+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"Pretty sure you have games where you are a potato that can't find his own dick.","replies":[{"poster":"Critmaster Garen","date":"2015-09-12T14:59:11.233+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=King Crunch,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=dEcKKP1o,comment-id=0008,timestamp=2015-09-12T14:53:39.477+0000)\n>\n> Pretty sure you have games where you are a potato that can't find his own dick.\n\ni wont deny that i also fuck up now and then. but bad games where i would play really terrible like that are rare. im not talking about games were someone loses lane. im talkin about entirely different behaviour of players, disregarding basic mechanics of the game.\n\nid say knowing how to ward, or to keeping an eye on jungle timers is something thats automated behaviour at some point. you dont screw this up anymore at some point. but its something like an adc trying to fight a bruiser in melee or people constanly overextending when theyve been caught 3 or 4 times doing the same thing already.\n\nno, im not fucking up on that level.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HalcyonDweller","date":"2015-09-13T07:22:07.995+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"We are all potatoes at some point in our League careers.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Jacknife","date":"2015-09-13T03:34:12.853+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's how the MMR system is designed.
