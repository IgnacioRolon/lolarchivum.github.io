I don't really see it as Niche at all, infact i see it as an all purpose CC tool. \n\nYou use the un-charged double tap version as an instant knock up for engages and or hard CC to secure a kill, and you use the charged \"send them flying\" version as an escape. Very rarely will you use the charged version offensively in a fight as it is too difficult to land properly without sending someone you don't want flying away.\n\nE Stun > Q > AA > W (keep them from dashinga way after stun) > AA > R (buy time for E cooldown, reposition for stun)  > E Stun > QQ > AA > AA.

I do wish however that it did a little more damage. Riot has said they kept the damage super low to balance the power of the distance thrown, and in that respect I think they were right in doing so. However I wish they made the non-charged doubletap version do more damage, because you are not using it to send them out of the fight, you are using it offensively.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Blitzedlegend","date":"2016-02-25T01:33:28.955+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol nice meme","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hosee","date":"2016-02-24T21:54:37.913+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=chipi99,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=TOQa8OdR,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-02-24T20:45:14.233+0000)\n>\n> Being an old Poopy main her ult was disappointing in terms of damage and niche use.\n\nMy nig, old poppy ult was the strongest ult in the game.\n\nEdit: Not sure if you were talking about old Poppy ult or new one.","replies":[{"poster":"Asyde","date":"2016-02-25T17:51:56.985+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Hosee,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=TOQa8OdR,comment-id=00000001,timestamp=2016-02-24T21:54:37.913+0000)\n>\n> My nig, old poppy ult was the strongest ult in the game.\n> \n> Edit: Not sure if you were talking about old Poppy ult or new one.\n\nHe was saying, \"I'm an old poppy main, and her new ult was disappointing in terms of damage and niche use\". \n\nAnd I concur, her old ult was insane, and her Q had the strongest scalings in the game as well. But her kit had to be kept simplified and minimal in order to balance that ult. She was truly high-risk high-reward champ. Her effectiveness was determined how well you could get her fed.
