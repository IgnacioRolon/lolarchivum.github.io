When his old rework was new I'm sure it was great, but now he's just old and can't compete with newer champs with well thought out kits. His kit feels rather rushed.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Kelg","date":"2018-06-26T14:49:11.299+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a Morde main, yes he does need a rework. Currently, his kit is very stat checky and leaves little room for you to outplay your enemies if they actually know what Mordekaiser does. Just watch any Morde montage on youtube, and you'll see that they are very unimpressive. He needs to be reworked to have more skill expression, and to be more useful to his team without relying on an ally to be near all the time as well. \n\nI've mainly played Morde since I first started in season 2 and I really didn't like his juggernaut rework(and still don't mainly because of his W forcing him to be near an ally or minion). His rework did bring some interesting concepts that I think should stay in some form, like the Dragon ghost, it's very unique and gives Mordekaiser an interesting niche. But even if they do keep the Dragon ghost, I think Morde should be made back into a solo laner(Mid, Top or even Jungle), since he always was before his rework. I really don't like the idea of botlane Morde, I don't really think it fits him thematically and hope they scrap it when they do finally get around to reworking him.","replies":[]},{"poster":"heroikc","date":"2018-06-19T23:41:40.448+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He needs a rework cause he's rather clunky, overbearing when ahead, hopelessly weak when behind, and rather slow.","replies":[]},{"poster":"OniZetsu666","date":"2018-06-19T22:34:06.305+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think he needs a fix more than anything.

Kinda like them spikes. And I have no clue. I mean they have a debug team that's separate from their normal coding team for champs and shit right? Like I get that some bugs can be really hard to fix or figure out but for this long? Hell I think there are posts dating two years back. At longest it should take 6 months. and that's being generous.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
