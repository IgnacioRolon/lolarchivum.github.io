Its making a bunch of whiney self entitled people who do whatever they want during a game ruining it for everyone else in the game. if your going to have &quot;roles&quot; for a game then they need to be strictly enforced. First off sorry i can say what i want when i want if you don&#039;t like it then no need to be around me. Honestly i wouldn&#039;t mind a system where people can &quot;block&quot; you and never have you in a game again. Second they are mean in korea everyone on the team will tell you what you did wrong when you did it and they surrender when they need to. None of this never give up stuff that makes the game worse. its a matter of fact most games when a team gets ahead its over. i dont have a team of 4 faker and 1 imacutiepie every game. and most people probably dont want a 40 minute long grind fest every time they play 20 to 30 minutes at most. surrender needs to be changed to 3 votes being enough AND if surrender is put up in a game 5 times then the other should be allowed to leave with no penalty. i can understand if the guy dies once at 5 and doesn&#039;t come back but there no reason to keep 3 to 2 people in a game they know they are losing but the rest wont surrender. until they changes are made your game will lose lots and lots of player to other games. This can be fixed really quickly and make the overall game more enjoyable for all.","replies":[{"poster":"AeroWaffle","date":"2018-07-07T01:09:06.144+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":">First off sorry i can say what i want when i want if you don't like it then no need to be around me.\n\nThat sounds pretty self entitled.","replies":[{"poster":"BlackenedScar","date":"2018-07-09T20:57:17.032+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"its called freedom of speech one of the most basic human rights this is why they have blocking and censor stuff in the first place no reason for it to be a rule when there are systems already in place.","replies":[{"poster":"Prandine","date":"2018-07-09T21:26:08.344+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=BlackenedScar,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=94X3A6EK,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2018-07-09T20:57:17.032+0000)\n>\n> its called freedom of speech one of the most basic human rights this is why they have blocking and censor stuff in the first place no reason for it to be a rule when there are systems already in place.\n\nFreedom of Speech not only doesn't apply to privately owned businesses such as Riot Games, it also does not mean freedom of speech consequences. This means that you can still be held accountable for your actions and words. From [Ulanopo's Knowledge Base](http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=4086541&amp;page=1#post43465469): \n\n>**Freedom of Speech!!!!!**\n\n>Doesnt apply. No really. If were talking about American law, the First Amendment only applies to the government making laws that prohibit speech and, even then, freedom of speech isnt absolute. For example, you cant incite a riot, plan to kill the president or yell fire in a crowded theater.\n\n>Also, theres nothing in the First Amendment that protects you from the consequences of your speech. People are fired all the time for making derogatory comments about their employer. My workplace, for example, has a social media policy that says that I can be terminated for badmouthing the company. They dont ask for passwords and access as some companies have been known to do, but it wouldnt be all that difficult to find me on the internet, knowing my real name, phone number and address.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-07-09T21:18:03.848+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=BlackenedScar,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=94X3A6EK,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2018-07-09T20:57:17.032+0000)\n>\n> its called freedom of speech one of the most basic human rights this is why they have blocking and censor stuff in the first place no reason for it to be a rule when there are systems already in place.\n\nActually it is not.\nAssuming you mean it as defined in the first amendment to the united states constitution:\n\n_Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances._\n\nIt prevents the government from silencing the press (seems familiar) or the public, or from preventing peaceful protest. \n\nIt does not apply to private businesses, it does not protect speech that threatens of condones violence or hate.\n\nTL;DR riot can erase your crying whenever they want, go back to your TD circlejerk.
