You wouldn&#039;t do that in person though(probably because you&#039;d get knocked the fuck out, or be shunned by anyone who saw you acting like such a crybaby asshat) why would you do it online? \r\n\r\nIf you are so upset that someone suggested a better way to go about winning the lane, please see a therapist, figure out what went so wrong in your upbringing and allow another person to give you some insight on how the world really works.","replies":[]}
