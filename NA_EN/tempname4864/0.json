Adding the ability to escape this ability would make it a bit more balanced, since it is currently impossible if you aren&#039;t already moving, have a gap closer, or tier 2 boots. \r\n\r\nlater in team fights, when he is able to engulf the entire team in one W and then ult, if he has 2-3 core items, it almost kills an entire team, for someone who points and clicks an ult that seems a bit out of control, yes there are counter measures, however, say there is a brand support with an annie, there&#039;s absolutely no counterplay at this point if she tibbers ults you, or amumu ult, wombo combo is a thing, however, oriana ult, yasuo ult, malphite ult, none of these do as much damage as brand with similar gold count\r\n\r\nto make brand an actual fair champion to play against, you&#039;d have to lower W width, lower ult damage slightly, and that would be about it. he would still be on par with other mid laners, just not disgustingly broken. I&#039;d ideally like to see champions that are easy to play have more risk involved for their reward, leaving champions that require a lot of map awareness, technically, and mechanical skill to be as strong, if not stronger to reward you for putting in more effort. People say this is unfair all day, but don&#039;t complain about hyperscaling champions, even though it&#039;s the same thing, put in effort at the beginning to stay alive, win easier in the end.\r\n\r\nhopefully this will be taken seriously and doesn&#039;t end up as another brand main downvoting fest.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2016-01-07T01:27:52.067+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":8,"body":"Yeah, Brand's definitely too strong at present.

To make his ult \"supposed\" to prioritise champions regardless of his passive, they'd need a new passive interaction for his ult and then you've got a flat buff.\n\nIf the bug fix somehow makes him unplayable then they can easily buff him, but he shouldn't be strong because one of his abilities isn't functioning as intended. I know you're going to say \"But Riven's animation cancelling!\" but I don't think animation cancelling is comparable.

I understand if the first thing you see is the circle on the ground. If you don't pay attention to the animations of the enemy brand then yea you will get hit for sure. Go into a custom game with a friend and see that Brand W isn't the full circumference that it shows. You can stand on the edge of it and not be hit. \n\nAs for his ult killing an entire team. Really? If it bounces to the same target more than once then yea that person is dead. But one hit from it isnt that bad. If it is one bounce it is fairly low damage His scaling is shit but his high base damage is a big factor in why his early game is so strong, alone with his passive. It is his passive that really hurts.\nIf the enemy brand gets all of your teammates in a W then you deserve to loose that teamfight. He is an immobile skillshot oriented mage with no escapes that excels in teamfights. He is not too great at 1v1's as his ult can't bounce and get the most out of its damage. \n\nLearn to play around his strengths.\n- He pushes waves once he has mana regen. Gank him.\n- Deny him early  and he will have a hard time killing anyone. He is not necessarily feast or famine, but his three main items (ryalis, Liandrys and Void) are extremely expensive. He cant go through MR without void or liandrys.  \n- He is hard countered by all in champs (and there are a lot of them that are strong right now)\n- Dodge his highly animated skillshots\n\n\nBrand relies on MR shred. Without it his burst is easily survivable. Support Brand is difficult to counter now as most supports are mages as well. Morg, Leo, Ali are all great picks against him. Thresh is not the greatest as if Brands ADC gets hooked he is free to land his spells.","replies":[{"poster":"Harrisun","date":"2016-01-08T23:39:01.352+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"Of course a brand main would comment paragraphs disagreeing with everyone else on brand nerfs.","replies":[{"poster":"Bijorn","date":"2016-01-11T13:38:12.579+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Da Poro Slayer,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=tVsMLBAg,comment-id=00050000,timestamp=2016-01-08T23:39:01.352+0000)\n>\n> Of course a brand main would comment paragraphs disagreeing with everyone else on brand nerfs.\n\nI mean in a way I can't disagree with you lol. Is he strong right now? Absolutely. I never disagreed with that. What I AM disagreeing about is how \"hard\" it is to avoid his W. The QQ about him right now is almost on par with the QQ that happens with LB and Zed when they become strong in the meta even though he is completely immobile. I feel like I gave some decent ways to counter him honestly. \n\nBrand has not been touched for a long, long time. He has never been buffed numbers-wise. The only buff you can say he got \"recently\" was the base mana regen and growth that most mages got in 5.22. New items have made him strong along with the meta.\n\nIf there is going to be a nerf, I think a decent one to go to would be his Q stun. Make it scale with level so it is not a 2 second stun at level 1. That would be a pretty decent one. But there is also a bug right now with his ult where it prioritizes champs even if they arnt ablaze, giving him much more power than he should have. Again, he has high base damage but low ratios. If you are going to lower the base damage to lessen his early game lane bulling, than I expect higher AP ratios for mid-late game.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"MunchCrunchLunch","date":"2016-01-07T05:33:49.281+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"yes. this. please. I can't escape his fucking W unless am LITERALLY AT THE EDGE. since the circle appears immediately when he casts it. its not like chogath where after you see the animation. you see the location of it. the damn W just flames you during the animation that he does making it impossible to be telegraphed.  now obviously champs with higher skill caps are better if you master them. however there is still too much room for mistake with them.  i mean i dont care how good you'e with azir or something at some point you will mis ult or E into the enemy team and get instakilled.","replies":[]},{"poster":"4NoxiousHours","date":"2016-01-07T03:13:17.401+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":5,"body":"HAHA BRAND MAINS!","replies":[]}]}
