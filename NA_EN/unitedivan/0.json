Listen guys. That's her job. She's an assassin, she's SUPPOSED to deal a lot of damage. She isn't tanky, and her only \"cc\" is gunblade. CC will DESTROY her very quickly. She isn't broken. Katarina is good at punishing mistakes, and that's why she is such a big threat to low elo, because they make mistakes all the time. If your team lets Kat get fed, that's your own fault, not Riot's fault for having a \"broken\" champion.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Notorious Reed","date":"2017-03-31T17:37:10.115+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"This champion isn't balanced at all.

You should be able to counter her in ways at every elo. her only being countered by point and click hard cc like a kassa or malzhahar doesnt show a good champ design","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"SKT T1 Lightdust","date":"2018-04-11T15:42:01.842+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"WOW I guees you people cant play malzahar or diana to counter her\nSimple play a champion that has cc and then cc her when she uses death lotus \nIS IT THAT HARD ?\nbtw who do you hate more people yasuo or Kata?\nExept if you play against flyerbex you wont win lol","replies":[{"poster":"ESG Tarek","date":"2019-07-29T14:24:03.845+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"kat atm is more than broken","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CletusKassidy","date":"2018-06-21T23:10:42.840+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Should remove her because she's garbage now.","replies":[]},{"poster":"7legendari","date":"2018-04-17T20:36:21.747+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Katrina is bae","replies":[]},{"poster":"NaughtyWord","date":"2019-12-07T09:00:10.383+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Imagine crying about Katarina in 2019.\n\n\nShe's one of two assassins who isn't insane right now.
