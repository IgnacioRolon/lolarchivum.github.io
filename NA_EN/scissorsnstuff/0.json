He does average damage and does so in windows. If I'm not mistaken though you can prevent this damage by bursting his shield down.\n\nAlso he is strong early, he falls off later if you don't feed. He can't push for shit unless he goes ap in which case he still wont scale well and pushing wont be a good idea for him. He can take towers I think since he scales well with attack speed but then I don't think he takes towers down fast.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"oSEXYPLATYPUSo","date":"2017-01-17T00:07:46.238+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:32}}","replies":[{"poster":"ScissorsNstuff","date":"2017-01-17T00:19:55.860+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"his stun is strong and he is very tanky, he also gets rewarded for tanking damage and kindof counters attack speed. Deals passive %hp magic damage and he can stop autoattacking for a moment which means a drop in sustain. \n\nHas nothing to help him take any towers or anything though. \n\nCurrently he has an advantage earlygame because of how he can take down the wraiths which makes him one of the few strong tank junglers. In otherwords he's probably leveling faster than normal not actually just being strong but snowballing exists. But this can be countered with invades and harass cant it? He doesn't travel quickly which means stealing from him should be that much easier","replies":[{"poster":"oSEXYPLATYPUSo","date":"2017-01-17T00:22:21.669+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"here a secret: ready? amumu is always a viable pick due to his kit... has always had a good win rate... regardless of meta... issue with the mummy and most people dont take advantage of it is he is BLUE reliant early he really needs the 1st blue... and most of the time the 2nd if you counter jungle/invade his blue he is worthless and hits lvl 6 so slow you typically can build a lead to put your team ahead","replies":[{"poster":"ScissorsNstuff","date":"2017-01-17T00:43:23.639+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"another, more accurate, way to put this is that he abuses the fact that the average gold player and below has no concept of earlygame anti-jungle strategy. Plat and above may also have this issue but I dunno. \n\nBut seriously, they don't or they just don't care because \"normals\" makes the game too non serious to use common sense. I talked some noobs I was playing with to invade with me for example. They did it, we killed 2 of them in jungle and bot was under tower, they just started farming and pushing the lane probably flaming their team. I tell my noobs to go take bot tower for free. Illaoi didn't come so we could only get it down to half because we wouldn't win the fight if they stopped being stupid so we passed on that after that. I cant even remember what happened to their jungler after that but the point is that when I'm not playing with noobs or even when I play customs with like a gold or plat jungler I see the same thing. Nobody actually defends jungle. They always do it in tournaments though and I get called a tryhard for playing the game before minions spawn. That's how common this seems to be and it comes to no surprise to me that something like amumu could get away with abusing this","replies":[{"poster":"oSEXYPLATYPUSo","date":"2017-01-17T00:47:13.831+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well there is a huge difference in coordinated team play ( lcs ) and 5 random people playing... if people wouldnt be so selfish and play as a team they would realize the true beauty of this game","replies":[{"poster":"ScissorsNstuff","date":"2017-01-17T01:15:34.414+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The difference isn't that big, they are just being lazyasses. \n\nThere is no real reason to stand under tower at the beginning of the game unless you really think theyre going to do something to it.","replies":[{"poster":"oSEXYPLATYPUSo","date":"2017-01-17T01:16:21.925+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"im not talking about just that... the entirety of the game it self and how it should be played","replies":[{"poster":"ScissorsNstuff","date":"2017-01-17T01:21:13.970+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"that's the only real difference.

But offensively soraka is very limited and she can't push well. \n\nSoraka has nothing whatsoever to make her a strong tower or objective taker but she could help immensely if someone else wants to do it.. fitting seeing as she's a support and all.
