It merely disagrees with the timespan over which something occurred.\r\n\r\nScience once told us it took thousands of years to make a diamond then it turned out it might just take one hundred and then some nerd made one in like 30 days with a machine. \r\n\r\nOn that same note\r\n\r\nEvolution tells us that man was made over several million years, the most respected book in modern human history tells us there was once an entity by any name or type capable of producing a human being in something believed to be a single day or possibly one to several thousand years depending on interpretation. Whatever the interpretation it can be concluded that its possible to make a star, the sun in particular, in roughly the same timespan. \r\n\r\nThis only becomes a huge contradiction when men who want to strip you of your freedoms begin politicizing it to take a roundabout path to doing so. \r\n\r\nTL;DR\r\n\r\nThere is no need to bring religion into an evolution debate and if you do then question who is influencing your politics","replies":[]}
