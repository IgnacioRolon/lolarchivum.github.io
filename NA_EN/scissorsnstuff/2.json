Sick of this she made her own scary mask and put it on. And when the scary demon guy popped out of the bushes again he said \"le rawr\" and she be like \"Le rawr, I'm even scarier!\" and he got scared and ran away. \n\nApparently the bloodmoon festival is about facing fears and things that bother you a lot.
