Fuck you, you deserve nothing and hopefully got nothing if this is the case! That you got an S should be surprising because you are so damn high on how hard you were winning. There should be tigerblood pumping through your viens our out of your worn fingers. Everyone on your team should be worshipping you as a hero or demon. \r\n\r\nIf all you can even do to complain about it is to post a damn picture of your kda then why would anyone write a book about your glorious conquest? That&#039;s pathetic. \r\n\r\nYou didn&#039;t get an S because you don&#039;t deserve an S. Go practice or throw your face at more games until you stop being weak!","replies":[]}
