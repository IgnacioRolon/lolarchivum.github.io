To put it back to normal, I hit \"Restore Default\" on all the different pages, except now, to move, I have to click Shift+Right Click and when I try to fix it the pop up says \"type a key\" but wont accept plain right or left clicks. Can anyone help me with this?","replies":[{"poster":"Digital Ram","date":"2014-12-03T00:16:24.729+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Jsquirrel,\n\nIt sounds like some corruption in your input.ini file. I recommend you delete the file, then launch a custom game to verify everything is working properly! This will recreate the file and should resolve this weird click issue. You can find the input.ini file in your League install location (Usually - C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config)\n\nLet me know if you have any questions!","replies":[{"poster":"Jsquirrel953","date":"2014-12-03T20:47:53.560+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"AH THANK YOU SO MUCH","replies":[{"poster":"Digital Ram","date":"2014-12-03T21:32:25.783+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Glad to hear that it worked!
