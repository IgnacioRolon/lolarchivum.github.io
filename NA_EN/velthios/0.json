Brand and Blitz have so much counterplay in the form of skillshots that you can dodge and when they're not impactful, you can feel it.\n\nTrist w/ Janna is like, okay you're gonna get shoved in and any sign of aggression on Trist and you'll be met by an AD who can 1v2 and you cannot engage on. It's so frustrating and impossible to do anything while you watch the hypercary shit on you levels 2-18.","replies":[{"poster":"Ahristocats","date":"2017-08-18T16:39:54.834+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"brand and blitz have as much counterplay as janna\n\nonly thing that has no counterplay on janna is her Q cancelling dash instantly\nand it takes skill so i'm not complaining","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Almighty","date":"2017-08-18T01:50:49.110+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":4,"body":"Maybe if people made some actual civilized well-constructed arguments regarding Janna's strenght, insted of the usual _\"Jannuh OP picked so much Champagne GG says big numbers pls nerf hur dur\"_ someone at Riot would actually take the \"Gameplay\" board seriously.\n\n_**Almighty.**_","replies":[{"poster":"flibitydoo","date":"2017-08-18T02:56:24.200+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"her winrate is naturally high because:\n\n1. she get's a lot of base movespeed off her w passive zephyr which makes it very hard to get caught. champions that put themselves at less risk (namely long range mages) naturally have a higher winrate since they don't die/feed as much. on the other side, assassins (who have high mobility so they can get in basically hugging range since they can only contribute meaningfully by being at point blank) tend to get low winrates since they expose themselves and run the risk of dying by putting themselves in range of everyone.\n\n2. her contribution from eye of the storm (The AD buffing shield, aka her E) can also be used without putting her at harm, again contributing to the whole \"very hard to die/feed\"\n\n3. if we ignore her E, the rest of her kit basically are a variety of tools that help counter assassins and melee champions. But this is kinda of all she can do so I think this is fine. She's not engaging, she's not undoing all the poke/trade damage in lane, she's not shredding your healthbar, just helping out with kiting melees as a niche.\n\nI don't think she's busted. I don't think she needs nerfs. she's one of the most nerfed champions in the game because every few weeks some guy will go to a champion statistics website, sort by highest winrate and then make a complaint thread to nerf the number one position (just like this thread since OP did nothing to explain the issue beyond pointing at winrate/pickrate).\n\noh and I forgot, the pickrate component-yeah she's a very easy champion to play and is 1350 ip which makes her very easy to pick up. if there was ever a champ to pick up in case you get autofilled to support then janna is probably one of the best if not the best because of those two reasons alone.\n\nthe most I would ever ask is to make her less boring with how her shield works by giving her more gameplay like encouraging it to be used to absorb damage to get the damage bonus or doing something else interesting. Something that allows an experienced janna player to actually express skill and be rewarded well for doing so.","replies":[{"poster":"Kloqdq","date":"2017-08-18T16:45:04.079+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The bit about her being easy is so true.
