She also has no counterplay really, unless you consider &quot;burst her down very very very fast&quot; counterplay. (which, tip, it&#039;s not. making someone&#039;s average lifespan .25s is very NOT fun actually)\r\n\r\nWhile her stats in Summoners Rift games might be meh, her stats in ARAM and pretty much every RGM she&#039;s allowed in are the best! She was so crazy in URF she had to be outright banned. Her winright in ARAM is the highest of all champs at almost 70%! 70%!\r\nIn Ascension and Poro King she boasts similarly amazing stats, always placing in the top 5. \r\n\r\nIs there any talk of a rework?

You have to position properly to distribute your buffs to as many people as possible without being close enough to the enemy team to get blown up, and only going for the safest of pokes. You have to make sure you use the right passive auto for the moment, Q for poke, W for trades, E for peel. Your ult isn't that hard to hit, but getting the most bang for your buck out of it can be somewhat difficult when you factor in that you need to position yourself so that you can hit as many of your teammates as possible with your aura so you don't have as much freedom to move to hit multiple lined up opponents.\n\nPressing your skill keys don't require much skill, but using them to their fullest does. I am not saying she is the hardest champ ever, but she does have a decent macro level skill ceiling. She is one of my favorite champion skill designs because she lets people with a skillset that is not geared towards micro play shine.","replies":[{"poster":"rtbf231742773","date":"2017-09-04T16:08:26.545+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a sona main with over 100  ranked games played and a win rate 70 % diamond 5 (i know dia 5 isnt a high rank but it is 2 me ) i can confirm you are right i wouldn't have made it this far with her if all i know was to smash buttons.\nMakes me sad that some people wants her removed. ;(\n {{sticker:sona-playing}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Velthios","date":"2017-09-04T09:17:43.445+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":6,"body":"It all seems to revolve around the passive auto, which honestly you guys are WAY overrating.

She is easy to understand, but how you use her is a different story. The ability to stop dashes with charm, ability to kite with rylais, and the ability to reposition using ultimate. All of this required intense mechanics that required putting some time to accomplish. \n\nYou may say that you have already done this without effort, then this goes to show that some people may click better than others.

That made her build combined with rylais very very weak. She actually has worse kiting now than before. Her kiting did become easier for those who could not kite before.\n\nRange is a huge outplay mechanic that can exist. ADC having just 25 more range can make a huge difference. Ahri losing 100 range on her w and r did make her lose a huge portion of her outplay potential because the range she needs to be in now puts her into range for all the free damage of many champ that just bursts her without any outplay potential. \n\nHer passive was also changed from spell vamp to per enemy hit. This is a huge nerf to her skill cap as she had the ability to actually recover a good amount when bursting with her passive up. This further made her into a really really weak and squishy and short ranged champ.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-09-04T16:19:39.674+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is only one sentence in my post about her passive autos.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"King of Demons","date":"2017-09-04T09:00:39.406+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Her skill expression lies in using your different empowered auto attacks and not spamming so much as to run oom.

Her skill expression lies in good positioning, mana management (I guess you could buy Tear to solve it, but Tear is also an awful item rn), hitting your ult (Lot more difficult than you think! It's very easy to Flash over it and punch Sona in the tits), and just moving around the map properly.\n\nHer kit is very well-designed (not including the wholly unnecessary CDR her ult passively gives as part of the failed rework). She's pretty good on the Rift as it is, but she's only great in RGM/ARAM because the map is as cramped as it can be. There's no way to miss ult on that map without aiming 180 degrees in the wrong direction. RGM/ARAM stats are worth less than nothing.\n\nIf you only \"LOVELOVELOVE playing Sona\" for her ability to cheese ARAMs, then shame on you. Shame. On. You. There's many different reasons to play her: Great secondary mage, excellent healer (Windspeaker's + Ardent rush and your ADC will never die unless they're stupid), highly engaging gameplay (Yes, you do more than just mash buttons), making your Rammus even faster, ridiculous burst damage with Lich Bane (Blue Chord + Q + Lich Auto = de_leted), and more.

She aims them by positioning.  When you're the squishiest champion in the game, with the lowest gold and exp on the map, AND most of that gold is going into items that give zero defensive stats, positioning is a matter of life and death.

Maybe too effective for her viability in higher elo, but without the giant KILL ME FIRST signs she'd low elo stomp even more than Master Yi.\n\nThe thing that makes Sona hard to balance is how bad a lot of people are at playing AGAINST her.  \"Oh I'll just take this 1v1 trade and ignore Sona over there... WTF I lost the trade!?\"  Repeat until insane winrate (on a champion that is objectively underpowered against people who know what they're doing).
