I need a real person to look into this because it honestly been a mistake I work my butt off this season to get to where I am and now all of sudden I get it all taken away because I got accused. that so wrong. that's pretty much saying you're not allowed to improve in this game because I been improving after watching guides and having membership off proguides to learn how to get better at the game and now when I do its a crime. I would really like my stuff back this is so unfair. no matter how many times  I support a ticket  I just get bunch of riot employee who all copy and paste the same thing over and over than close the case instead of hearing my side of the story plus riot also stated it is not mmr boosting if your playing with a duo and all my rank games  I been playing with my friend and I legit have screenshots of our games together .-. so I guess he got boosted too than right? doesn't make any sense or adds up at all nobody got boosted like what the crap","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-08T22:46:47.425+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The teams that look into those types of things have certain things they look for, as well as a set of skills that let them spot certain changes or types of behavior common for boosting. I know you've reached out to them already, and it does look like they took the time to explain their reasoning in the first ticket which they keep referencing you back to.","replies":[{"poster":"ItsClementine","date":"2018-01-08T23:26:54.840+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I did not get boosted!!!! why can't any of you guys understand that. their is a lot of other players who had the same problem I do and riot doesn't do anything about it like their so perfect and never get anything wrong","replies":[]}]}]}
