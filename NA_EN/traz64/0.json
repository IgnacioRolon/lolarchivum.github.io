More specifically on these here boards. These unintentional disconnects could be a few things from their computer crashing to something happening upstream of the player's internet. with the changes to the leaver buster system I've noticed the complaining even more.\r\nIn other games if you disconnect for any reason, obviously excluding server issues, the community seems to agree that you should be reprimanded. Being that a simple loss of MMR in games like SC or a small ban from ranked in the case of CS:GO. Yet here I see a significant amount of people believing that they should not be reprimanded if they disconnect due to internet issues and calling the leaver buster system unfair if they get punished for something that they don't perceive to be their fault. This seems odd to me because, whether it is their fault or not (and let's be honest here, it is your fault most of the time), you have just severely injured the playing experience for your 4 teammates. \r\nIn terms of the causes I see it ranges from an issue with the computer crashing, which makes me think that they don't play any other PC games and don't have full control of their system. To some people complaining that they shouldn't be punished for playing on an unstable internet which just baffles me.\r\nOn another note, if someone leaves the game you're in or just doesn't connect you don't care what caused it and you'll report them for leaving and ruining the game for you. So why is it that people seem to think that when it happens to them they shouldn't be punished? Is this concept of your disconnect not being your fault just being perpetuated by people who've never played other competitive games? Do they simply not realize that an intentional dc is indistinguishable from an unintentional dc? Or do they just not realize how much they're ruining the game for others?\r\n\r\nWhat do you guys think causes this perception that people have of being the victim when they're disconnected? Do you think the idea that it may have been unintentional should even be programmed into the leaver buster system?","replies":[]}
