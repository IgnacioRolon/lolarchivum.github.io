Is he only available through Legacy chests?

I actually do have a couple more questions.\n\nBasically what you're telling me is that the skin shard has a chance to drop with any hextech box and that the Legacy box is just for retired legacy skins which would not be Traditional Trundle so basically I'd have to get lucky with regular hextech crafting kind of like with Gemstones only with a lower drop rate. That kinda sucks because I was hoping that the Legacy chests would not just be for retired Legacy skins but for all legacy skins.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-20T00:06:01.249+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, you'd need to be incredibly lucky to specifically pull *Traditional Trundle* from a Hextech Crafting box.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Great Muta","date":"2016-12-20T00:28:04.451+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"It's based on a bit more than luck.
