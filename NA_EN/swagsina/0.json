Does it work that way? Or is there a time a skin must be in the shop before getting available to get from chests?\r\n\r\nGreetz swagsina","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-05T23:43:49.475+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't believe those capsules will have their loot tables updated except for having the tokens taken out of the possibilities. Basically, the list of items you can get now is most likely final and newer skins may not be added to them.","replies":[{"poster":"swagsina","date":"2017-12-06T00:04:56.284+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oke and how about t he skin orbs? I can craft one of them, but can that one contain new content? Just wondering because I can craft it after the new christmas skins release.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-06T01:51:25.883+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Those would fall under the same category as the project capsules most likely, a special event item that has specific loot tables. I wouldn't think they would be updated either.","replies":[{"poster":"swagsina","date":"2017-12-06T10:05:58.841+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oke but chests bought from the store before the patch can contain the skins right? when they come live","replies":[{"poster":"swagsina","date":"2017-12-06T10:10:32.038+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And i forgot to ask about the hextech mystery emote, its came along with the 5 project capsules bought but can it drop newer emotes?","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
