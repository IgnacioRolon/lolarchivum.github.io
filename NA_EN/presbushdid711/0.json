Years ago you could almost always count on a Rioter stepping in and clearing up some non sense on a regular bases, it got to the point where you eagerly awaited a &quot;smiting&quot;, knowing full well one was incomming.\n\nNow a days this board contains a plethora of posts and posters that keep spreading their talking points and has become an echo chamber. They added mods, which perhaps they thought was a good substitute, but at best they provide calmness, and at worst are seen as Riot cheerleaders with an agenda.\n\nThe last red post was 19 days ago, the previous one 27 days. \n\nSolution: Add Riot to &quot;Brahmoarqqplox&quot; and i&#039;ll do the smiting that should never have left.

Before we could view games, people were constantly making up stories about what \"really\" happened  in the game. Then you find out they spent the first 5 mins following the jungler around, and canceling backs with anivia walls. Then, magically, the guy that has been posting every 30 seconds proclaiming his/her innocence suddenly went mia in said thread.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GreenKnight","date":"2019-01-07T23:42:00.114+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This post yet again feels more like Memes&Games.\n\nRiot team was on holidays, give them a while to settle back, hmm?\nEdit: Never mind, too late again :c","replies":[{"poster":"PresBushDid711","date":"2019-01-07T23:46:42.035+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=GreenKnight,realm=EUNE,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=1UGb0kzc,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2019-01-07T23:42:00.114+0000)\n>\n> This post yet again feels more like Memes&amp;Games.\n> \n> Riot team was on holidays, give them a while to settle back, hmm?\n> Edit: Never mind\n\nI mean it's been like this before the holiday break.\n\nI'm not blaming Tantram, I'm suprised he responds at all.
