Unfortunately, Dash Space Lord didn't have access to a mic that night, so he had to respond to our voice chat with text.

You can choose to think he was banned incorrectly and even was PERMANENTLY banned for just this one game and his behavior.  That's you choice.\n\nLike, I said, it doesn't matter at all if there were other games as long as the game quoted as evidence was part of what tipped the system over the edge/threshold (which is certainly the case given the chat log and his previous account status). Would a cop be ethical in planting evidence because he's doing it to a \"bad guy?\" Past actions have literally zero bearing on the morality of using false evidence against someone. It is never fair for a false report to count against you, regardless of past behavior. Think of it like having one beer before driving (assuming it is under the legal limit). Your reaction time is probably still worse but infinitesimally so and you're not much of a worse driver. Now, if someone injects you with additional alcohol, puts you over the legal limit and then gets you arrested, would that be moral? Let's say that if you didn't drink at all before that, the alcohol injection isn't enough to get you in trouble.\n\nRegardless of what he did in the past, his account status was not in question and we got that chat as evidence for why it is now banned. It's pretty obvious that it's grossly unethical to punish people for what they didn't do and if the threshold for a ban is met/moved closer to by a false report, that is not a justified ban. If the OP's chat wasn't used as part of the investigation, then it should not be provided as \"evidence\" and he should not be banned until legitimate evidence is presented.\n\nBTW: While not really relevant here, the fact that false reports eventually get lower weighting doesn't mean that they start out that way. The first few false reports likely have equal weighting to that of any other player. Moreover, if someone makes false reports only very infrequently (perhaps out of spite against someone), the system probably won't flag them as someone with a low report weighting because it's not an established pattern of behavior. This is why it's important to have independent verification and a fair trial.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"EsRoEn","date":"2016-01-29T16:01:05.363+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"dude...look\nriot has a pathetic way of resolving issues. they want people to be quite and pretend they enjoy playing this shit. but is clear to everyone you can only enjoy lol in a 5man premade game. if not, 98% of your games are just sickening. problem comes because of their matchmaking system (that they dont want to resolve because they get lots of money with people being FORCED in bad situations, and FORCED to get mad). they get them banned as soon as possible and people in 90% of cases create other accounts. you can see from that pathetic lie that \"you are among 0,06% of lol players that have been banned for extreme toxicity\" or something like that , that appears when you are banned. we all know the lvl of toxicity and how many players get banned and is not 0,06%!\nalso riot does a pathetic job on analyzing the chat logs. They do anything possible to have your words out of context.

They tell you: âok, he did not had the right to do that, BUT LOOK HOW YOU ACTED! YOU ARE A BAD PERSON YOU DID HARM TO ANOTHER GUY WHO MAYBE HAD A BAD DAY AND DECIDED TO TAKE IT OUT ON YOUR FAMILYââ¦ this is riotâs conception of justice.\n\nmy own experience: I have lots of friends playing lol, they ALL curse, and flame in 90% of their games, but they play like 2 games per day, 3..4..5 days a week. Except when some of them did some homophobic comments and got chat banned, they never get banned. Me on the other hand I play between 4 to 10 hours, every day! I get reported for âTOXICâ because I am laughing at a guy who is asking for report in our team when he is 1/9 and refusing to cooperate the entire game, who curses us, and because I use sarcasm as my way of telling that guy he is bad, or sometimes even tell it straight in the face to shut up cause he sucks, his attitude and kda prove it,  I get banned! The 3 games that appear in my âaccusation casesâ are like this.. or in one because (I had to suppose) I speak to much. I had a game with a newbie where I was trying to explain him how to farm, items to take, etc.. I got banned for toxic when actually I was helping him. A dude who did not understand my language reported me and tribunal who obviously did not understand a word also decided that talking to much is bannable.\n\nriot should GROW UP A BIT, and understand that is a competitive game and they do nothing to even the games, they have a pathetic matchamking system that brings togheter people who have a 3/10/1 kda rate with people that bearly die in any game (win or loose), just because they are both silver or whatever. they have a very frustrating matchmaking and they punish us , as I said before just for defending ourselves sometimes.\nso my point is: HOW MY FRIENDS NEVER GET BANNED if they curse, and i get banned for teaching someone to play? \nthis prooves riot's systems are full of flaws and are obsolete. is like a society of 200 years ago. is pathetic and discusting!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Prandine","date":"2016-01-27T19:10:59.348+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":16,"body":"For this one case, from what I saw in it this is what got you punished: \n\n>call me froggen michael\nor im afk\ndo it\nez\nDO IT\nU %%%GOT\n\nRegardless if you were with friends there is no need to say stuff like this.

You could be discussing champions and he might not have even been in the game. \"Blind picked Riven and didn't have to face Gayren! Whew!\" etc. Besides, even if it was meant to be insulting, there's no way in hell that deserves a punishment by itself. \"Oh wow, someone made a bad pun and included sexuality in it! I'm SO offended! Please ban this incredibly toxic player, whah, *cry* *tears*\" Really? \n\nThat's basically banning people for bad jokes if it's all that it was. If he wrote, this \"Heteriktor\" talking about Viktor, would that be bannable too? It's not different at all and if you attribute first as more toxic, that's just your own homophobia manifesting since it's equally innocent in objective terms. Likewise, if someone wrote \"Homoviktor\" I bet you'd find that more offensive even though it's not at all objectively. What does that even mean? It's just the same as Heterviktor but applying to homosexuals instead of heterosexuals. Unless you're homophobic, why would that be any more offensive to you? So yes, there is CLEARLY a double standard here in discussions of sexual orientation and what you can say.\n\nWhat you're quoting doesn't even have any relevance.

I'll tell you one thing though, if riot wants to be this soft about handing out bans don't spend another dollar on this game. Seems a bit fishy because they know people have multiple accounts. Almost like they just want you to spend more money on your other accounts once you buy everything for your main by handing out these weak excuses for Permanently banning accounts. Has the idiot who banned me even seen the last episode of ALL/CHAT when they had Garen dressed in the Star Guardian lux skin. They pretty much meant to make Garen look gay.

This is a thread about a particular chat log which obviously lead to the ban since Riot gave it to him and he wasn't banned before that. You can always find examples of toxicity in the past if you look hard enough but the fact that this is what ultimately moved the system to ban means it was undeserved. It doesn't matter if he has 100 examples of toxic behavior before. He didn't go to the limit where it thought a ban was appropriate until this game and since this game is an example of a false report, he shouldn't be banned.

Because permanent bans are very rarely handed out for just one game alone. Riot doesn't hand out permabans for behavioral or gameplay issues until they go through the entire account history and deem that the person in question has no interest in reforming or interacting with others in a neutral or positive manner, so obviously it does matter if a person has a history of acting up, being punished and not taking those punishments seriously enough to change their behavior for the better. Also, since this game was included in the Reform Card it couldn't have been a false report since false reports are thrown out and don't count.","replies":[{"poster":"PrometheS","date":"2016-01-29T06:58:05.487+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Prandine,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=qXwAUe0I,comment-id=002c00010000000000000001,timestamp=2016-01-29T06:45:52.035+0000)\n>\n> Why you ask?

It's silly to even mention it. If the investigation takes into account a false report as a positive, that's still unfair. Nothing else in his past is relevant here UNLESS the system would have banned him anyway. That's like if someone steals a pen and then you punish them when someone else steals a car because \"sure he didn't steal the car but we did find him stealing that pen.\"\n\nSince his account wasn't banned, this wasn't the case. He got the warning right after that game and the chat logs too. If it weren't for that game, he would still be unbanned. Whether you agree or not with whatever past behavior he had, the system didn't previously consider it toxic enough to actually warrant a permanent ban until this game.\n\nAlso, assuming \"false reports don't count\" is nonsense. If someone FREQUENTLY makes false reports then it won't do much of anything but if they rarely report and then just decide to make a false report one day, it definitely counts. Do you think Riot has 100 monkeys on coke reading every message? Come on... it's such a naive and guaranteed incorrect view to think that all false reports bear no weight.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
