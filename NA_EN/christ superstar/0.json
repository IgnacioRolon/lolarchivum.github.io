The pointer does not scale with the DPI, so It's tiny on a 4K monitor, even a big one like mine, because it gets lost among particles and motion. It's almost impossible to keep track of during a team fight, to the point where it seriously reduces playability.\n\nYolomouse suddenly stopped working with a recent patch, now it keeps changing back to the normal pointer, though it remembers the Yolo pointer if I put the mouse over the exact spot where I set it. \n\nIt looks like moving the cursor to the edge of the screen to scroll the camera always resets the pointer, though bizarrely it is changing it to a white Windows-style mouse, not the even-more invisible game mouse, which is almost impossible to see even when farming minions, much less in a fight against a player.\n\nSince then, I've cut way back on playing, and mostly just ARAM if I do, because my ability to participate in team fights is dramatically reduced.","replies":[{"poster":"Kazymandias","date":"2017-10-23T01:07:54.327+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Post Script: It turns out that the problem with Yolomouse was fixed by making it full screen, instead of borderless.
