The whole thing is nicely formated in a way that additional stuff could be added upon it in the future. The next step that I see as a fan is to nicely intergrate it within the Client itself which would attract even more players to search and read the lore.\n\nEach additional lore story add small details to the world (it ether being stuff like mentionings of different languages, mythos, places, and traditions), and its truly something I believe all of us were waiting for. For me in a funny way its also a interesting challenge piecing for example: all the places locations on Runeterra, there are quite a few mentioned in the past year (some with definitive known placements, while some less so). \n\nSeeing the small map of surrounding Piltover area made me happy since that will just add to what I would like to see more and its the geography of the world.\n\nAll Im saying is, good job Riot, and I cant wait to see more in the close future as it would seem :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GreenLore","date":"2016-12-01T22:57:57.424+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its pretty likely that warwick is gonna come out within the next 3 patches(likely the one after Camille or maybe the one after that).\nI mean look at the piltover page and you'll notice that it also has a zaun-part that is inaccessible right now,which will likely be added with the warwick rework.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jeddy017","date":"2016-12-01T21:18:57.218+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The Warwick rework is well into production, so I'm sure they already considered the Piltover story when updating Warwick.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Chromatic Eagle","date":"2016-12-01T20:25:40.786+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"How long do we have to wait for the rest of the Piltover stories?

Galio may have a prominent role in Demacian history, since hopefully he will have some ties to Poppy who was older than the nations founding and previously had ties with the ancient Gargoyle.\n\nAlso look at some of the icons in this picture:\nhttps://cdnb3.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/004/017/127/large/sperasoft-studio-icons1.jpg?1479485276\nhttps://cdna0.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/004/017/112/large/sperasoft-studio-icons2.jpg?1479485142\nhttps://cdna0.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/004/017/132/large/sperasoft-studio-icons4.jpg?1479485684\n\nWe already know Piltover and Zaun icons will be distributed in the lore update soon to follow since its shown on the main page of the factions ( plus the icons have surfaced on the PBE), one could also assume Demacia and the rest will get their icons in a similar event, most likely these types of icons.","replies":[{"poster":"Valor Bot","date":"2016-12-01T22:57:47.436+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh hey, I hadn't seen those icons before.
