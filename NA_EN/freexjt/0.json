At About 6mins I received a HUGE lag spike but league was the only application that was receiving this lag, as my Skype and Microsoft Edge were fine. It was impossible to be able to play at such a high MS and I thought that maybe restarting my game would fix it.... this would have probably worked but I had a notification that I maybe offline and to check my internet connection. So I did as instructed and all was fine with my internet connection but not with the client. I tried to restart my pc but the same happened so I could not connect back the game receiving a 20min leaver buster. I am asking for this to be removed as I didn't choose or want to leave the game but the connection to your servers said I could not connect and I know it wasn't just me as it said in the top right that \"we understand people are experiencing login issues and we are working on a fix\" by the time I got back onto league of legends the game had finished hence by leaver buster being given. So I ask for you to remove this please as it is not my actions that caused this whole conundrum to occur. \r\n\r\nThanks FreexJT.","replies":[{"poster":"demolishr","date":"2017-06-16T10:43:00.420+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes we were duo queing in normal and you disconnected and I had 200 to 1000 ms throughout the game considering nothing else was lagging","replies":[]},{"poster":"DWlGHT K SCHRUTE","date":"2017-06-16T21:31:16.348+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had the same thing yesterday.. I was lagging in a game but the rest of my internet was fine. In fact my ping was the normal 54ms which made no sense. It was like the server itself was lagging me. I also did other tests including pinging other things on the internet with 0% packetloss, all the while I was lagging horribly in LoL but ping number never left 54ms.\n\nI restarted cable modem, router, and PC all at same time. Everything came back up and when I tried to get in the game the sign in button was gray no matter what I did.. tried rebooting again, same everything. I clicked the link and deleted the entry in the file it said and was able to get back in but the lag was still there.. somehow my team never gave up thanks to my Yasou getting super fed so I didn't get a leave and actually caught up and got some kills myself and we won.\n\nAlso 5-10 min after I finally got back in, the lag magically stopped.  I played this morning and NO issue at all. Played again this evening and lag was back and same thing magically it cleared after X minutes.\n\nOnce again, not a single thing other than LoL was lagged out. I did pings, speed tests, streaming test, and even joined another game while the lag in LoL was going on. 53-54ms ping, steady. \n\nIt makes no sense, no other players were lagging but just me. Everything points to my internet but there was no issue. It's also very odd that the sign in bug happened during all of that as well?\n\nEDIT: P.S. the reason I came here is now when I try to login, I get in but it takes over 60 seconds to \"authenticating\". It used to be instant.!!","replies":[{"poster":"DWlGHT K SCHRUTE","date":"2017-06-16T22:16:46.269+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"OK So I think i figured out the issue but it confuses me.\n\nI have two ways to connect to the internet.. Ethernet or Wifi. Each time I fixed it I did the following:\nDisable ethernet, Enable and connect to my wifi... I have to reload the game because it will never \"reconnect\" automatically even though my net comes back, probably because of a different IP address.. but the rest of my net comes back just fine and other games..\n\nIf I go back to ethernet by disable wifi, enable ethernet, and reload game.. its fine!!!\n\nThere is something about the game client that ties me to the IP the game client launched from?!\n\nI've been pinging google since I posted earlier, there isn't one single request time out... yet league lags me and I have to do this switching magic to fix it?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-06-16T15:43:17.359+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The offline error is something that's being investigated, and it's really important that you run through the workaround to prevent it from happening again.\n\nGo to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\nOpen \"LeagueClientSettings.yaml\" with notepad\nFind the line:\n\ngameflow-patcher-lock:\n\nDelete this whole line\nSave the file, restart your LoL Client - and you should be able to log in again.\n\nIf you were impacted with a leaverbuster, hit us up in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).
