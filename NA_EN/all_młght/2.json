What is the purpose to having late game champions if the objectives is to shorten games drastically? Countless buffs towards assassins have been made over the last few patches, direct and indirect, to shorten games. Short, fast, action packed, damage overload type games catered towards TenCent&#039;s top clients, internet cafes where FF15 is something in the norm. If you pay for 1 hour of games, you don&#039;t want to play 1 game for 48 minutes. Riot Meddler and Ghostcrawler are merely puppets for these changes so don&#039;t take it out on their poor souls, they simply cannot do anything about it. Notice that they don&#039;t care/listen to the communities outcry for longer games or nerfing damage. They persuade you into thinking that they are listening to you but in actuality their company is failing everywhere else besides TenCent&#039;s holy ground, China, where most of Riot&#039;s financial decisions are made. Otherwise why would they try to make their strategic game shorter?\r\n\r\nTL;DR: riot neglects late game scaling champions bc their push for shorter games is decided by tencent which caters to internet cafe goers that pay by the hour and don&#039;t want to be playing 1 game for 1 hour.","replies":[{"poster":"T I L T B O I","date":"2018-06-23T09:30:00.705+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"everything will be reworked and suck, when you have medium to long length games you CAN close out early by showing skill with an early game comp, or you can end with scaling or a mix etc...with forced short games you just fuck up mostly everything. i don't know why they're pushing so hard to shorten the games it just feels awful to play now because what you get is games that are way over by 15 minutes but people drag them out to 30-40 minutes anyway and you just sit there miserable even longer that's not really fun","replies":[{"poster":"Attticus Finch","date":"2018-06-24T00:15:15.864+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They're shortening games because game length is a massive issue in pro play.

Part of the problem with the way League has been shortened is that the laning phase has remained mostly the same, but it's mostly the late game that has shrunk in duration. Because of this, late-game champs have suffered in the past, because instead of being really good for the last ten or fifteen minutes of a game, they only got good for about five, sometimes not at all. Riot's answer has been to have these champions scale faster, but they overshot the mark when they made marksmen spike at two items. At this point, if games are to be shorter, then there needs to be attention given to make each phase of the game about equal in length on average. Even if matches were to reach 20 or even 15 minutes, if one-third of that time was devoted to the late game, late-game champions would be viable. The same applies to early and mid game champions.","replies":[]}]}
