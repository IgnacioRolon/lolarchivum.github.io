And today i checked that the 7 rune page bundle is taken out, which before was 7 pages for 2600 RP , which was is about 371 RP per 1 page.\r\n\r\nNow theres this new Add 2 Rune pages for 590 RP that is 295 RP per 1 page... That essentially means i lost about 525RP. And so i thought ok. Ill just use a refund token so i can save that extra 500 RP but i can't even refund rune pages???\r\n\r\nDid RIOT notify or post anywhere that they planned to make this huge rune page change because I am a little butthurt that i lost that extra RP that i could have easily saved by waiting 3 days...","replies":[{"poster":"RiotBok","date":"2016-05-25T02:11:44.316+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Totally understand how you feel on this one.

Sadly, you purchased a 7 Rune Page Bundle. Our sale is for 2 for 1 rune page which means if you purchase 1 rune page then you will get another rune page for the same price. A 7 Rune Page Bundle doesn't count for this sale.\n\nI'm sorry if my response was a bummer :( but if there is anything else I can assist you with, let me know!\n\nThanatosâœª\nRiot Player Support Specialist\"\n\nThis was the reply i got... Unfortunate :( . Is there anything that can be done? I've seen several posts asking about this situation, how people lost RP and IP for purchasing rune pages without knowing the upcoming sale.\n\nThanks for trying to help.","replies":[{"poster":"RiotBok","date":"2016-05-26T01:18:37.926+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"That shouldn't be the case.
