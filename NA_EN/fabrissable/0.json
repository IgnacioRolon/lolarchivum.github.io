This happened to me 2 months ago, but it passed after not entire week. Im 99% sure it my internet connection's fault, because when I changed to mobile back earlier, everythign was going allright. But now I dont have a possibility to change my connection and I dont want to wait another week. Can you help me fix it, or should I conntact my internet provider? I just want to notice its only happening to League of Legends, other games don't have this problem.
