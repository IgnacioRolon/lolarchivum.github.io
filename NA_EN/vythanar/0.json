I'm having a hard time diagnosing exactly how it happens (I think I need to be more aggressive in trading back when someone trades with me), but it usually snowballs into a situation where I'm afraid to CS at all because they can unload significant amounts of damage onto me, and thus miss out on a LOT of farm and end up horribly behind and useless. \r\n\r\nI was wondering if you guys had any suggestions for what to do when you're in a very unfavorable matchup or your opponent is obviously more skilled with their champion.\r\n\r\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Mat7itan","date":"2014-10-25T23:58:26.167+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Certain match ups just work that way (especially if you get behind). It would be easier to explain how to not get zoned or still cs while behind if you gave a list of champs you are getting zoned as and who your against (also a little info on your starting/ early game items on those champs might help).","replies":[{"poster":"Vythanar","date":"2014-10-26T01:06:04.319+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay, here's some examples:\n\nI play Wukong top when I can't jungle with him. Although it's kind of uncommon, I was having a really hard time with a jungle Alistar (similar to how I have issues against Renekton) because if I get too close to him, I get CC'd, harassed, and and can't really trade back effectively. \n\nThe other really prominent example is playing either of my midlaners (Kat and Ori) against LeBlanc. I feel absolutely helpless in the matchup because her jump is so hard to dodge if she's any good. Ori is a little easier because I can usually keep my distance, but I just get wrecked as Kat. \n\nI think that some of my problem might stem from the fact that I sometimes get a little freaked out and don't try to trade back. For instance, though LeBlanc can do massive damage at level 2, she can't 100-0 so I could make some attempt to fight back (though her jump backwards makes it difficult). With Wukong I'm never certain if I want to jump in Q->E preferably or E->Q if I need to close the gap and then W out, or if I should try to extend the trade with the AS increase from my E.","replies":[{"poster":"StOrmysLIVE","date":"2014-10-26T07:15:59.467+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"when its wu vs alistar- his eq is extremely mana intensive, and is a great lane pusher.

You have to learn when you can trade and how to trade effectively; knowing when you can out trade your opponent is key. Playing scared is a guaranteed way to zone yourself out of CS, you have to know how to position yourself well and take favorable trades when you have the chance. Certain champions naturally get zoned out early, Vayne is a prime example, but if you watch a good Vayne player, they'll know when they can take trades and when to back off.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DocRedgrave","date":"2014-10-26T01:00:32.497+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"IamTitan makes a good argument, but he's missing the fact that recklessly pushing minion waves when you're behind your lane opponent in levels can often lead to them safely farming under their turret and zoning you to death. Try and work on last hitting minions with autoattacks and avoiding using AOE spells on them. That's a good start in most matchups. Otherwise it's often best to snag Ancient Coin first along with some pots if you're getting zoned by a champion such as Ryze. I've seen a number of my fellow Gold elo players do this lately.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2014-10-26T00:55:40.610+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"With this little amount of information, all I can do is suggest a champ with good lane sustain.

Stick to your minions so you won't take the brunt of their damage nor CC, and they'll preferably be pushing the wave in your favor. Hug the tower and don't do anything risky.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Leblancs Boob","date":"2014-10-26T01:37:32.035+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:99}}","replies":[]}]}
