I think that a Rogue frog is a really neat idea because frogs don't really have great armor, and they have poison sometimes which is more rogue than mage.\n\nWell make his passive a poison skin for enemies that he comes into physical contact with (is AA'd by melee, or AA's them in melee) but the poison changes depending on which ability he used last. Also an enemy should not be able to be constantly poisoned for attacking him, so it can only apply to the same enemy once every so many seconds.\n\nSince he's a rogue/ninja thing so he should definitely have a darkness related ability, how about we call it \"Shadow Pulse\" it should send out a moving skill shot of black fog, and he goes invisible when he touches it (for like 2.5 seconds). It should give him a speed boost while he is in contact with it, and it should have a projectile speed just slightly faster than whatever his move speed was when he cast it. The idea here is that he can either stay with the cloud, and run away faster, but the enemy will pretty much know where he is, or he can throw out the cloud to juke with his very short invisibility. The poison can be a short blind effect.\n\nI don't think that the cloud will be quite enough to escape against today's modern mobility though, and I don't want to exacerbate that problem, so some light CC should do well. How about Caltrops? Very rogue/ninja like, and we already have an ability in game that works sorta like them. Zig's Mine Field! We just make it to where instead of exploding, and going away, they stay there, and instead of instant exploding damage, they apply a bleed effect. Keep the slow, that's the point. The poison for this ability can be a fear effect (hallucinogen).\n\nHis next ability can be an execute where he pulls you in with his tongue (think Darius pull range, but single target) and bites your head. If he executes a minion this way he eats it and heals a tiny bit. The poison for this ability can be just a regular DOT.\n\nHis ultimate... Alright, I'm done. I was joking at first, trying to make a bad Greninja parody, but honestly some of these abilities kinda sound cool, and I cant really think of another ability. Unfortunately I don't really see this kit having a strong role, but if his ultimate were the right ability he might have potential as a support.","replies":[]}]}
