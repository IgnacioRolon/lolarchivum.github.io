And whenever I go blind pick by myself, there are ALWAYS Golds, and Plats, maybe rarely a diamond. And then I go ranked, and its just people around my level..\r\n\r\n\r\nSO ummmm...why am I being matched with people higher ranks than me in blind pick","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-12T21:13:38.207+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I checked up on your match history and it seems like you've been playing a lot of blind pick, which isn't designed to only match you with people of the same skill level. Ranked might be the place you're looking for to get more even matches.","replies":[{"poster":"SheBrokeMyHeart","date":"2017-12-12T22:28:20.493+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been playing Blind Pick to try an get some chests but I can't thats why.

Why should it? Faster games for everyone. Would you prefer someone not being able to play norm games with their friends because they're too high or too low compared to each other?","replies":[{"poster":"SheBrokeMyHeart","date":"2017-12-12T22:28:58.191+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm...My friends and I we are the same rank except  my other one is a bronze xD","replies":[]}]}]}
