There isn’t much to the LB =J4 theory of JoJ and it was resolved in the old lore. I don’t know what op is talking about. It was just LB masquerading as Jarvan who then attacked Swain in order to make Jarvan look like the aggressor. A charade to make J4 look bad in the eyes of the League. The real Jarvan was back in Demacia with Talon and Katarina trying to figure out what was happening. It wasn’t like some long term conspiracy, it was simply a single instant of LB pretending to be Jarvan for some of that juicy dirty political maneuvering.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Umbral Regent","date":"2018-08-12T01:12:50.006+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> ...are nods to some of the old lore for Kalamanda...\n\nAh, gotcha.

I was mostly just under the impression that there might've been something in the current lore that I'd missed. That said, I'm looking forward to seeing what comes of Kalamanda in the future when that player-facing lore comes around.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Infernape","date":"2018-08-12T00:57:49.951+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Clickable Kalamanda when?\n\nOff topic question.
