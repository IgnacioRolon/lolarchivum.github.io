Making you even more useless by selling everything and buying tears ? This is worth a ban. \n\nNext time you will respect your allies choice of playing the game till it ends and you will not throw away your stuff for useless items.","replies":[{"poster":"BlueThingamajig","date":"2017-05-04T17:08:01.714+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"OP claims X.\n\nOP willingly provides documents that shows X is false.\n\n????\n\nProfit?
