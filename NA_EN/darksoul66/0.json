Riot really needs to be stricter with people who say shit like shit like shti and then proceed to just troll. As it completely devalues the queue and turns it into basically normal games.

Beyond that, Season 7 set a precedent where now Flex Queue is indisputably worth climbing in, since now you can get unique Chromas for the Victorious skin per queue.\n\nIMO, if you don't take Flex 5's (or to a potentially similar extent, Flex 3's) seriously, just don't play those gamemodes. Don't ruin it for the people who do take it seriously - especially _now_, since there is actually something to achieve in them.","replies":[{"poster":"Who Fed Ru","date":"2018-03-15T23:43:14.172+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I usually only play it rarely, if I'm in a premade and we are actually able to queue together in Flex.\nOften the reason for that is because I'm still in Flex Gold, so I'm able to carry my friends into the season reward elo.\nWe won't take it more seriously than normals, but if it's normals with a reward, why should we play normal instead of Flex?\nSee the problem with the queue? That's exactly the attitude 80% of the people in Flex, and nobody can blame anyone for that but Riot.\n\nThe reason why people play it is for the rewards, but you can't expect people to take it seriously.","replies":[{"poster":"Umbral Regent","date":"2018-03-15T23:59:08.838+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think I'm more likely to blame the community for having the mindset than Riot somehow inadvertently creating the mindset. I'm probably a whole different category of competitive player, but I honestly think the mindset should be this:\n\n\"It is basically Normals with a reward attached, but it's not as important to me as Solo/Duo, so if I do decide to play it, I'll climb until I can reasonably get the reward, and then leave others to compete for their own while I return to my other modes so that I neither jeopardise my own reward in it nor harm other peoples' climbs\"\n\nBut, that's just not a rationale anyone's going to take - probably not even in an ideal world.\n\nI suppose my biggest problem with that mindset you propose:\n\n> We won't take it more seriously than normals, but if it's normals with a reward, why should we play normal instead of Flex?\n\nIs that people are missing a pretty sizeable chunk of info that should go into the logic. That Normals has no real stakes, whereas Ranked Flex 5's actually has risks and stakes involved. There's criteria to be met, and if you fall below those criteria, you won't get the reward.\n\nIf people don't want to take things seriously, then why are they playing a gamemode with stakes involved? Why aren't they just playing Normals? If there's a reward to be had, why are you half-assing your way to getting it?\n\nUltimately, I can't blame Riot for the community's mindset on Flex 5's, and outside of clear cases of trolling or feeding, I know that the loathesome people who don't put their all into Flex 5's simply because \"it's just flex\" aren't in a position to be punished, as they're still somewhat in it to win.\n\nBut, I can still sure as shit sit here and seethe over the fact that the community generally refuses to take anything but Solo/Duo seriously.","replies":[{"poster":"Who Fed Ru","date":"2018-03-16T00:19:20.115+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's simply because we know we are going to climb anyway in that queue, even if it's slower than when going 100% tryhard.\nThat's not really risks and stakes, but more like a matter of time.\nSo if sooner or later anyone is gold and gets the extra reward, all gucci.\n\nAnd it's not like that I'm just trolling around all game, I just don't take it as seriously as trying to win a 3-20 game by dragging it to late game. Things like trying out a new champion and things like that are the things I'm speaking of here when I'm saying I don't take it more seriously as norms. Just the usual chilling, talking about shit and rekking some noobz. Some games just don't go that way, and these are the games when I'm just like \"It's just Flex anyway, let's go next\" instead of trying to comeback. Also, I generally don't really get any feelings of a fair challenge in that mode. In my last Flex game, there were players with Ranks from Silver 2 to Diamond 5. That's also a reason why you simply can't take it seriously.\n\nBut honestly if we sit in there and you have some dude there (usually a solo player) that cries around all game, I wonder why these dudes don't just play SoloQ. You can't really blame the community for not taking a queue seriously where you have players from all elos put together, and call it a fair match. If anyone is to blame for that, it's Riot for trying to keep the failed experiment called DynamicQ alive, and make people able to gain not only the main season reward, but also an exclusive reward for it. Ofc that gets people into the queue that actually don't care about their Rank there, and just play it because it's normals with a reward at the end of the season.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-03-15T22:56:21.429+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"People say \"its just X lol\" in everything.\n\nIt is just their excuse to be garbage, has no effect on if they get punished for being garbage or not.
