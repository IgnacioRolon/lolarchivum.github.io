I dunno if the honor system is the only way you can get key fragments since it's the new month and i haven't even gotten another key fragment. I assumed that the counter resets so that its easier to get key fragments again. \r\n\r\nHonor level is two btw.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-08T00:56:34.437+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your key fragment drops should be somewhat evenly spread throughout the 28ish day cycle, but if you've stopped getting them completely you might have already gotten your 12 for your cycle. About 28 days after you got the first key fragment will be when the drop rate resets.\n\nAs a side note; the honor system actually makes it a bit easier to get those fragments! Before you had to win a match before having a chance at getting fragments, with the honor system you just need to be level 2 or above and play a match. You don't even need to win now ^_^!","replies":[{"poster":"I Eat Hippos","date":"2017-07-17T04:43:58.447+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm, I definitely havent gotten more than three with the new system after about 1.5 weeks of playing, and I get honoured almost every game and also had \"most honourable member\". is the amount of times you get honoured irrelevant?","replies":[]},{"poster":"ReerandRee","date":"2017-07-08T04:54:14.639+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you still have to own the champion you play the game with?
