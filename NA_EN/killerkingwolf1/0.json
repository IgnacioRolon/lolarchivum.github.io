Although for the past couple of days  I've been lagging hard such as getting 200 ms farming  to 500 ms in fights before this I was getting 60 to 70 ms only. So I was wondering if anyone knows what I kind do/what do you do, to help lower my ms. I do  not believe its my internet since everything else runs smoothly as before, its only just when I get into the game. Thank you","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-11T02:12:06.812+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While your internet is still running smoothly there's still a pretty good chance that your network is having a hard time getting connected to our servers.
