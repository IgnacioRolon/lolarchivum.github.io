However, I would imagine the current bot system that reads games and checks logs cannot tell when a player is being boosted. When the Tribunal existed, this was easier because players could review what a player played and how they preformed on them. I know myself and many players feel cheated when put up against players that are far outside our elo. It would be really nice to have a system that could actually see/ban boosters. Anyone have suggestions?\r\n(I recently had a person playing Kha in ranked for the second time ever. His scores were 20/0/2 and 23/2/4, and he executed double jumps and midair Q&#039;s perfectly, something a first or second time kha shouldn&#039;t be able to do. This is just the most recent example I have)\r\n**If I am allowed to put in the players Op.gg I will for validity.","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2016-12-25T17:56:55.691+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can submit the names to support tickets, but posting them here will get your post removed for name and shame.\n\nThere are people posting here every now and again that were \"randomly banned\" and people go through their games and find obvious boosted ones, so they are definitely banned. The main issue is that you can't ban them until after they have done it so there is not much of a way to remove the impact. Also, playing kha very well your first couple of games with him is not indicative of boosting. They could have watched videos to learn how to do that and just been naturally good at it. Riot looks more into it than that before they decide to ban.\n\nJust report them at the end of the game for the most relevant option and move on. They will be banned eventually if they are, and won't be if they are not.","replies":[]}]}
