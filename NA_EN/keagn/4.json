I was thinking about the Voodoo Lands while working on my champion concept, and couldn&#039;t help but wonder why the region hasn&#039;t been explored more. Currently we have one champion associated with them, that being Annie, the Dark Child {{champion:1}} . In my opinion, the Voodoo Lands is where all the taboo creatures/magic is exiled, and kept. After the lore retcon, some champions have found themselves unexplained, and unaffiliated, but I think I have a nice home for them. Here&#039;s a list of champions I think would fit right in with the Voodoo Lands:\r\n\r\n{{champion:63}} The Burning Vengeance\r\n{{champion:9}} The Harbinger of Doom\r\n{{champion:25}} The Fallen Angel (Just resides after her exile)\r\n{{champion:56}} The Eternal Nightmare\r\n{{champion:35}} The Demon Jester\r\n\r\nA lot more could be associated with the Voodoo Lands, these are just the ones I think would reside here. Be sure to give me your thoughts and what not in the discussion bellow! I&#039;d love to hear what you guys think ^_^","replies":[{"poster":"Epsilaun","date":"2015-04-14T17:16:04.673+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea, i know it takes a lot of work to dev new champs but they really need to get to work on their under developed lore areas if they plan to continue with the summoner retcon. Voodoo lands is one of them for certain, as is the Rakkor/Mount Targon, seriously their old map doesnt even have mount targon on it, they have a gargantuan or something, are they the same? are they close? who knows..........\n\noverall i see these as good fits though im not sure about nocturn, the whole thing was he was birthed from nightmares/the nexus in twisted treeline (shadow isle) but he clearly isnt a part of them.  Good to see someone notices these other places.\n\non related notes, Riot, give us more large scale zone based patches, like the shurima and freljord.   Explore these damn places, hell let the patch consist of a rework+a champ or 2, even if that causes a large break between champ release, we already see that so make it feel worth it.......you claim your redoing your lore but you left far too many loose ends","replies":[]},{"poster":"OhtheShinx","date":"2015-04-14T01:49:17.020+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aww you didnt mention [Cyrus](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/jxEEUIXR-cyrus-the-witches-curse)!","replies":[{"poster":"Keagn","date":"2015-04-14T01:54:18.071+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Oh the JINX,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=I7bAreA4,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-04-14T01:49:17.020+0000)\n>\n> Aww you didnt mention [Cyrus](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/jxEEUIXR-cyrus-the-witches-curse)!\n\nIt was nothing personal, I didn't mention Gershom and Loi (My own Voodoo Lands Concept) either :P\n\nBut looking back on it, I think we're both in Kamiroo's contest, it would've been so sick to do an interaction!

I think he wouldve been eaten by loi if i had chosen you xD. At any rate its possible we DID meet, gershom and loi wouldnt remember however, due to the nature of Cyrus's lore.","replies":[{"poster":"Keagn","date":"2015-04-14T10:58:25.837+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Oh the JINX,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=I7bAreA4,comment-id=000100000000,timestamp=2015-04-14T02:03:27.862+0000)\n>\n> Lol we are! \n> \n> Yea we shouldve, i chose to fight razzak because i feel that would be fun to imagine.

We charred Tate up pretty good though xD","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"WakkaSeta","date":"2015-04-14T04:08:35.340+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:9}}, {{champion:35}}, and {{champion:56}} would probably just get dumped into the Shadow Isles faction in this new lore.","replies":[{"poster":"Keagn","date":"2015-04-14T10:57:05.982+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=WakkaSeta,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=I7bAreA4,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-04-14T04:08:35.340+0000)\n>\n> {{champion:9}}, {{champion:35}}, and {{champion:56}} would probably just get dumped into the Shadow Isles faction in this new lore.\n\nI honestly don't think any of them fit with the Shadow Isles.
