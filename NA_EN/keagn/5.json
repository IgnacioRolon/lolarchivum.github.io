He is a medium sized, well built individual, with a silvery grey-blue pigment with lighter grey and coral red-orange highlights in his complexion and details, such as his fins. His sea green eyes are sharp, and quickly pinpoint his targets, strike fear into his enemies, or assure allies of his cause. Around his neck a collar like fin goes from his back to his chest,  coral red-orange fins that extend from his upper forehead to the back of his head, along his mid-back, and coral red-orange fins on his elbows. Ushio&#039;s webbed hands extend into clawed fingers more suitable for gripping his rifle or other objects. A large gold  belt raps snugly around his waist, adorned with polished coral and jewels, gold rings adorn his upper arms, he wears gold gauntlets with aquatic gems on his hands, and a gold headpiece/helmet wrapping around his forehead, partially covering his nose at a point while framing his head/face. Like most Marai, Ushio&#039;s tail is unsuitable for traveling on land, but he cannot manipulate the waves to move under him. However due to an artifact in his possession (a gem adorned on his chest), Ushio is able to either will a whirlpool to carry him, or transfigure his tail to form legs with webbed feet (as well as a slightly smaller tail) that he may then use to travel on land.\n\n######(For now this may be demonstrated as a toggle function until I can find a better way for this to be reflected in game)\n\n#Overview\n\n>Ushio is a slightly immobile long-ranged marksman who strives at knowing where his target is, and taking them down quickly. His kit allows for reliable damage, as well as reliable utility for locating and taking out the enemy. By staying behind terrain, minions, or allied champions, Ushio can disrupt an enemy team while weakening one of his opponents to dominate both two-on-two skirmishes, and team fights.\n\n#Stats:\n\n>Health: 518-1916 \nHealth Regen: 5.5-14.6\nMana: 268-988\nMana Regen: 7.5-22.5\nRange: 625\nAttack Damage: 51-105\nAttack Speed: 0.658 (+0%-48%)\nArmor: 21-72\nMagic Resist: 30 (+0)\nMovement Speed: 335\n\n>                                                             ######(Structured as Level 1-18)\n\n#Abilities\n\n**Passive: Uzu&#039;s Wrath**\n\n> For each consecutive auto attack Ushio lands on the same target, he gains a stack of \"Uzu\" (Max of 3 stacks). For each stack of Uzu, Ushio will deal 5% more damage per auto attack, and gain 4% damage resistance to incoming damage coming from his target. Changing targets will reset stacks.\n\n**Q: Aqueous Stream** \n\n>Ushio fires a continuous beam from his rifle that lasts up to 2/2/2.25/2.25/2.5 seconds, stopping on the first target or surface it hits and dealing 40/55/70/85/100 (+0.94/0.96/0.98/1/1.2 AD) physical damage over time. Killing a unit will extend the duration for 0.25 seconds, with a maximum extension of 1 second. Ushio can move while firing, but is slowed by 15% movement speed during the duration, and cannot change direction of aim. Aqueous Stream may be canceled early or interrupted during its duration.\n>\n>Range: 1050\nCost: 60/70/80/90/100 mana\nCooldown: 8 seconds\n\n**W: Resonate Pulse**\n\n>Ushio lets out a sonic pulse within an area in front of him, revealing a target area in front of him (as well as all present units), dealing 60/75/90/105/120 (+0.45 AP) magic damage and silencing them for 2 seconds. Resonate Pulse will bounce back off of enemies or terrain toward the location of casting, and if the sound wave hits Ushio, he gains a 6/8/10/12/14/16/18/20/22/24/26/28/30/32/34/36/38/40% movement speed that decays over 3.5 seconds.\n>\n>Range: 775\nCost: 80 mana\nCooldown: 14/13/12/11/10 seconds\n\n**E: Abyssal Lure**\n\n>Ushio throws an orb at a target location, which begins to glow after a 0.35 second delay, charming all enemies within a small radius for 1.5 seconds before exploding, and dealing 80/105/130/155/180 (+0.8 AD) physical damage.\n>\n>Range: 850\nCharm Radius: 275\nExplosion Radius: 335\nCost: 100/105/110/115/120 mana\nCooldown: 22/21/20/19/18 seconds\n\n\n**R: Vortex Shot**\n>\n> Passive: When Vortex Shot is active, Ushio's next auto attack on an enemy champion will apply \"Mark of Uzu\". \"Mark of Uzu\" can only be applied to one target at a time, and will fade automatically after 2/2.5/3 seconds. \n>\n> Active: Ushio fires a skill shot that travels a fixed distance or collides with terrain and detonates after a 0.5 second. Upon detonation, the \"Mark of Uzu\" will be consumed from the affected enemy champion, creating an explosion at their current location before teleporting the enemy champion to the detonation site of the skill shot. Each explosion will deal 150/250/350 (+0.75 AD) physical AoE damage. If the enemy is untargetable or has a spell shield at the time of the explosion, they will not teleport, but both explosions will still occur, and deal damage.\n>\n>Range: 750\n>Cost: 100 mana\n>Cooldown: 120/90/60 seconds\n\n#Recommended Builds\n\nStarting items: {{item:1055}} {{item:2003}} {{item:3340}} \n\nEssential Items: {{item:3031}}  {{item:3046}} {{item:3006}} \n\nOffensive Items: {{item:3153}} {{item:3142}}  {{item:3087}} {{item:3085}} \n\nDefensive Items: {{item:3156}} {{item:3139}} {{item:3102}} {{item:3072}}\n\n\n*****\n\n\n#LORE\n\n\n**Overview:**\n\n>Renown for both his political influence and impeccable aim, there are few creatures in the deep that can escape Ushio once the shot has been fired. Armed with his true shot beam rifle known simply as \"Uzu&#039;s Pike\" , Ushio ventures to the surface both to locate the so called Tidecaller and Moonstone, and out of curiosity of the land dwellers.\n\n**Excursion:**\n>*A \"ship.\" That is what they called it. The vessel sat lifeless upon the reef, no visible damage except for the tattered cloth fastened to three tall pillars. Along its side the symbols \"U.S.S. EXCURSION\" had been crafted, perhaps the structure's name. There had been rumors of these so called ships for awhile now. The stories went that land dwellers could not travel the seas themselves, and so they created ships to do so for them. Just about everyone has seen one on the water's surface, but what was one doing down here?*\n>\n>*I made my approach to the Excursion slowly but surely, letting the current do most of the work. The ship was rather well made, with sections of a strange material lined up to create an outer shell of some sort. I pressed my hand against its side, and experienced a rather odd sensation. The material was fairly smooth and sturdy but was neither stone nor any other mineral.  How strange, I thought to myself. I swam up to the platform of the vessel, which was also sectioned out, but more flat than the rest of the Excursion's exterior. Near its center, a barred off section covered a fair sized hole on the platform. I gripped onto the bars, and swam upward to open the chamber. I grabbed an egg-shaped object fastened to my chest and squeezed, causing it to emit a bright light. I dropped the lure down into the pit, revealing confined walls and other oddities within the ship. Taking a moment to prepare myself before entering.*\n>\n\n\n**Discovery:**\n\n>  *The Excursion's interior was filled with containers of various shapes and sizes, some of which were knocked over. Upon further inspection, I discovered something buried in a heap of rubble. I shot back slightly, startled by the discovery. The creature had a strange pale complexion, with dark blue garments of some sort  concealing most of its body. I moved away some of the containers that covered its lower half, and made another discovery that only unsettled me more...*\n>\n>*...the creature had legs.*\n>\n> *So the stories were true then, I thought to myself. These were what land dwellers looked like. Well, the dead ones anyway. It would have seemed that the land dweller didn't fair so well in the deep. I removed what remained of the containers which entombed it, and proceeded to lift the corpse up to the main platform, when something fell off from it. The little metallic object caught the light of my lure and shimmered as it sunk onto the chamber floor. I let the body drift upward for a moment, and retrieved the tiny, narrow metal object.*\n>\n> *How curious, but what was its purpose? It was far too small to be a weapon, and something told me it was not some form of adornment either. I swam back up to the platform, only to see a school of fish forming a frenzy around the corpse, tearing at the flesh and releasing scarlet ichor into the sea. I let out a fearsome screech which rippled through the water, scattering the little silver devils. I frowned a bit as I knew I could no longer study the land dweller, the sharks would surely be coming by now.  I made a thoughtless motion and removed the long deep blue garment it was wearing, and put it on myself. I pushed on the body slightly, giving the corpse enough motion to drift away from the vessel, before swimming off myself. It was best not to be caught by the predators, at all if I could avoid it, but I was especially vulnerable since I was unarmed.*\n>\n>*I saw the dark figures in the distance swarming the land dweller, shrouded in a cloak of blood which betrayed him. I swore to myself this was just the beginning, that I would find out more about these creatures. There was an entire world to be discovered, but for now, I would do so at a distance.*\n>\n>*There was much to be discovered.*\n\n**Calling:**\n\n> (To be added!)\n\n**Secrets:**\n\n> (To be added!)\n\n**Reclamation:**\n\n> (To be added!)\n\n\n#Dialogue \n\n>**Upon Selection:**\n>\n> \"My odyssey brings my ashore.\"\n>\n>**Movement:**\n> \n> \"The land is...dry? What is the point?\"\n> \"It is I that shall save my people.\"\n> \"I'm a little disappointed by the lack of fish.\"\n> \"Uzu aids my crusade.\"\n> \"I'll find my mark.\"\n> \"There's so much light on the surface...\"\n> \"I shall return to the deep when this is over.\"\n> \"We are all tied to the ocean.\"\n> \"A shark must maintain motion.\"\n> \"The tide approaches.\"\n> \"There is much to be discovered.\"\n>\n>**Attacking:**\n>\n> \"I always hit my mark.\"\n> \"Water doses even the fiercest flame.\"\n> \"There's no use trying to get away.\"\n>  \"Such strange prey these land dwellers.\"\n> \"They believe they can fight me?

If he has his whirlpool, this gesture is heavily exaggerated.\n>\n> \"Yeah, like they say, its all skill-\" *drops rifle (spins around, etc)* \"-I meant to do that.\n> \"Up it goes and-\" *drops rifle (spins around, etc)* \"-oh hey, I didn't see you there.\"\n> \"Trust me, you won't know what to do with all this-\" *drops rifle (spins around, etc)* \"so, I'll conch you?\"\n>\n**Taunts:**\n>\n> Ushio tosses three pearls into the air, and fires at them one by one.\n>\n> \"Stay still guppy, I dare you.\"\n> \"I prefer a challenge, but beggars can't be choosers.\"\n> \"You know what happens to a shark when they stand still?\"\n>\n**Interactions:**\n>\n> **Joking near an enemy Nami:**\n>\n> \"Aye angelfish, why don't we just dive right in?\" \n> \"Wow, it's reel quite isn't it?\"\n> \"Aye angelfish, you don't have to play koi with me.\"\n> \"What's your angle? I don't bite. I mean, unless you want me to.\"\n>\n> **Taunting an enemy Nami:**\n>\n>\"Where's the moonstone, Tidecaller?\"\n>\"You disappoint me Angelfish, I thought you were more than just a pretty face.\"\n> \"You're better off going back to the sea, Nami.\"\n>\n> **Joking near an enemy Twisted Fate:**\n>\n> \"Wow, you're a reel card shark aren't you?\"\n>\n> **Taunting an enemy Nautilus:**\n>\n> \"You were better off at the bottom of the sea.\"\n>\n> **Taunting an enemy Fizz:**\n>\n> \"Well squirt, I'd love to say a smaller target's a bigger challenge, but I think you disprove that.\"\n>\n\n#Animations\n\nNow I can't actually animate these things (unfortunately), but hopefully I can give you a general idea of what they may look like:\n\n>**Movement:** Ushio has a somewhat awkward walk/jog while carrying his rifle (due to some inexperience with legs). Wisps of water and bubbles may be visible around his body.\n>\n>**Homeguard:** Ushio glows radiantly and can be seen with his tail swimming towards his location. The tail will not fade (even when idle) until the homeguard buff does.\n>\n>**Idle:** Ushio will stand with Uzu's Pike at a resting position, and look around at the nearby scenery.\n>\n>**Attacking:** Ushio will aim down the sights of Uzu's pike, and fire a somewhat wavering pulse of sea green light (think wave length of light).\n>\n>**Attacking a Turret:** Ushio will get into  a crouching position, and aim slightly upward when firing.\n>\n>**Critical Strike:** Same as attacking, but instead Uzu's Pike will fire out a straight beam of cyan of light.\n>\n>**Recall:** A whirlpool forms on the ground nearby Ushio, growing a little larger with each passing moment, until Ushio dives into it, and it disappears. When Ushio arrives at the spawn platform he will emerge out of a similar whirlpool.\n>\n>**Dance:** Ushio holds his rifle like a guitar and rocks out on it, occasionally spinning and holding his right hand up in the air for a \"rock on!\" gesture.\n>\n>**Death:** A pool pf dark water forms behind Ushio has he stumbles backwards. Uzu's Pike disentegrates in a blazing yellow light, and dark tentacles pull Ushio's body into the deep.\n>\n>**Respawn:** A portal of water forms on the spawn platform, as Ushio (with his tail) floats through it, holding up his right arm as Uzu's Pike re-materializes in his grip, and stumbles slightly when his lower half transfigures to form legs.\n>\n\n#CCOS Challenge\n\nhttps://i.imgflip.com/lltqu.gif\n\nPretty self explanatiory for Ushios Lure, though I had to make the GIF myself :P\n\n#Fun Facts\n\n> * Ushio means \"Tide\", \"Salt Water\",  and \"Opportunity\".\n> * Ushio is also a name of a Japanese Fubuki-Class Destroyer\n> * Ushio is part of an order known as the \"Cult of Uzu\" which celebrate the might of the whirlpool.\n> * \"Uzu\" means \"spiral\", or \"whirlpool\".\n> * Ushio's rifle is known as \"Uzu's Pike\".\n> * Ushio inhabits a sunken vessel known formally as the \"DSS Excursion\", just outside the Marai city.\n> * Ushio's curiosity of land dwellers led to him wanting to be the Tidecaller. However, he had no desire to venture into the abyss. The labor was instead undertook by Nami, the Tidecaller.\n> * After several months without return, Ushio staged an uprising of sorts, saying that although Nami was brave, it was clear she wasn't the \"true Tidecaller.\" It was then that he sought to undertake the task himself.\n> * Ushio is unable to control the tides like Nami. To travel on land, he utilizes an artifact called \"Uzu's Wrath\" to create a whirlpool which carries him over land.\n> * Although Ushio is fascinated by land dwellers, he believes that the Marai are superior in most (if not all) respects.\n> * Ushio is quite attracted to Nami, often referring to her as \"Angelfish\". \n\n#Patch Notes\n\n>* Added radius indicators on Abyssal Lure\n>* Lowered Aqueous Stream's damage to 75/85/95/105/115 from 75/90/105/120/135\n>* Added more description to how Aqueous Stream functions\n>* Plundered Furor now takes time to charge up to its peak.\n> * As a sort of side effect, Plundered Furor's duration changed to 6/7.5/9 seconds from 7/8/9 seconds.\n>* Enemies that Ushio steals damage from through Plundered Furor are no longer immune from stolen damage.\n>* Entry one of *The Rise of an Order* added!\n>* Lowered Aqueous Stream's damage to 40/55/70/85/100 from 85/90/95/100/105\n>* Lowered Aqueous Stream's scaling to 0.94/0.96/0.98/1/1.2 from 0.85/0/9/0.95/1.0/1.5\n>* Changed Aqueous Stream's duration to  2/2/2.25/2.25/2.5 from 1.5\n>* Excursion added/updated\n>* Discovery had begun to flesh out. Still needs more however!\n>* Typo corrected so Ushio's auto attack range now correctly lists 625 range\n>* Abyssal Lure radii increased. Charm radius to 275 from 155, and explosion radius to 335 from 250.\n>* Aqueous Stream now correctly described as a damage over time ability.\n>* Added new tip that Aqueous Stream may be canceled/interrupted during its duration. \n>* Lowered damage reduction on Uzu's Wrath to 12% from 21% (4% per stack from 7% per stack). \n>* Movement speed boost on Resonate Pulse now scales by level and has been increased to 6/8/10/12/14/16/18/20/22/24/26/28/30/32/34/36/38/40% from 15/15/30/30/45%\n>* Added a possible (tentative) ultimate substitute (Vortex Shot), be sure to let me know your thoughts on it!\n>* Finished out the Discovery section of Ushio's lore, check it out!\n>* Teased 3 upcoming sections: Calling, Secrets, and Reclamation. Get psyched!\n>* Added new quote(s) and updated Ushio's appearance. \n> * As a result, Ushio's mode of travel has been changed. Some animations may be changed also to account for this.\n>* Fixed some boo-boos \n>* Added a list of animations.\n>*Added dual function where players could toggle between whirlpool or leg travel. This may be later implemented as a W change.\n>* Rise of an Order update. Had to kill Gershom and Loi :(\n>* Officially removed Plundered Furor\n>* Removed the Rise of An Order story from main page, however different sections can be found in the comments.\n\nBe sure to leave me your thoughts in the comments down bellow, as well as any suggestions for this, or future concepts.

Mid-tier laner who demolishes bruisers, but gets crushed by assassins. Hard to say how powerful he is; depends on what kind of comp he's fighting.\n\n**Individual Skills**\n\nPassive - This is *very* strong. 15% bonus damage and 21% damage reduction is a *lot* in a 1v1. That said, the strength of this skill all depends on how long it lasts. The most easily comparable (Urgot's autos apply a 15% damage reduction, but his apply to all damage dealt by the opponent) ability lasts 2.5 seconds. I get that he can't last hit/switch targets or else it resets, but those are still some pretty darn high numbers.\n\nQ - An interesting take on an idea pretty similar to The Culling and an excellent example of a 'logical' skill, where the skill's effect are basically exactly what you'd expect from the description. The main question is \"Can this be cancelled?\"; if it can't, it's liable to be left at level 1, since the implication is that enemies can only be damaged once by it. The secondary questions are 'how quickly does it extend to its full range' and 'how quickly \n\nW - So I'm guessing this is a bit like Gnar's Boomerang, but without the ability for it to track the caster and with an MS boost instead of a CD reset. Considering this is basically his only sticking tool, it could do with a little more range or MS boost. Additionally, is there a reason why the MS boost only has 3 levels? \n\nE - I'm assuming enemies 'charmed' move towards the centre of the AOE, rather than towards Ushio. 150 radius is really small. For comparison, the stun AOE on Heimer's grenades, which is probably one of the hardest things to hit in the game, has a radius of 135, and it typically has a shorter travel time than 0.35 seconds. On the other hand, 180 + 80% Total AD is a pretty hefty damage total. The main issue I see is that Tenacity makes hitting with the damage portion of this ability very difficult, even if you land the charm dead on.\n\nR - Eh; this one makes me cringe a little. Stat theft is one of those things that always sounds more fun than it ends up being; you might know in your head that Trundle has stolen a bit of AD and nearly half your defenses, but it's hard to sense when you're actually on the rift. \n\n**Playstyle**\nWhilst his abilities make me a little uneasy when taken individually, I actually like his kit as a whole except, ironically, for the one ability I really like in a vacuum; Aqueous Stream. I'm guessing part of the point of Aqueous Stream is to harass and clear waves without deactivating Ushio's passive, but when it comes to actual engages, there's no actual reason to use it over auto-attacks (unless your opponent has gotten out of range). His laning phase seems pretty good, so long as he's paired with a hard CC support; chaining a stun into his E is especially potent, plus his Q harass is probably quite strong. As a team fighter, he's terrible (as I assume he's intended to be); low mobility, short range, limited ability to shrug focus. On the other hand, if you ward up for him, he can hard shove with his Q and demand multiple enemies come to deal with him (or one Assassin, see below), or else he'll start chunking turrets.\n\nMy main worry is his ability to basically say 'I win' when dueling bruisers mid to late game. Between the AD reduction on his ultimate and the damage reduction, your typical bruiser doesn't have much of an answer. On the other hand, he doesn't have much of a defense against Assassins at that point (even the AD ones), since he needs at least 4-5 seconds to actually become pseudo-tanky (and he'll be dead by that point). As a result, he's ridiculously high variance.\n\n**Kit Personality**\nMuch more 'marksman' than 'fish person', which is fine, since that seems to be more the slant you're going for. The main thing I think you could work on is that Ushio doesn't feel like the kind of champion for whom lines like \"I always hit my mark\" or \"There's no use trying to get away.\" make sense, considering A. he isn't exactly a champion with difficult to aim skill shots, nor especially long range and B. hes really not very good at chasing enemies down, nor bursting them. His lore and personality paint him like his kit should be either highly mobile/good for chasing (a la Vayne or Lucian) or long ranged and bursty (like Varus or, to a lesser extent, Caitlyn). His current kit feels more like it should belong on more 'scrappy' marksman like Graves, who can (theoretically) take as good as he gets. Right now, he's not the kind of guy who goes into your jungle and tries to hunt you down. He's the guy who shoves down lanes, wave clearing with his Q, and daring the enemy team to fight him or else he'll take turrets.\n\n**Suggestions**\n\n- Make his Q either a damage over time effect, make it interact with his passive or make it cancellable (if it isn't already). Whilst it's a useful wave clear tool, it feels like it doesn't fit in with the rest of his kit.\n\n- Increase the AOE on his E, but reduce the damage a little (possibly making it scale off total AD). By itself it's a little weak, but it's probably a little too strong when paired with a support's crowd control.\n\n- Perhaps a little extreme, but I'd personally change his ultimate completely. It doesn't really feel like it fits the personality of the hunter with amazing aim; it feels more at home on a 'gritty' ADC; someone who fights dirty or isn't afraid to get into the thick of it.\n\n- In general, he could do with something that stops him getting assassinated without being required to build Randuins/Banshee's Veil. Most short ranged ADCs have a defensive tool (Grave's Passive, Sivir's Spell Shield, Urgot's Shield/Passive) or a mobility tool/focus shrug ability (Vayne's tumble/invisibility, Lucian's dash, Quinn's Vault). Due to the ramp up time on his ultimate and passive, Ushio doesn't have the on demand durability to survive a burst combo, nor the GTFO power to put any kind of distance between him and his opponent. His only real answer is his silence, which against 80% of assassins, is easily dodgeable.","replies":[{"poster":"Keagn","date":"2015-05-19T21:38:04.413+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MalphiteThePower,realm=OCE,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=hiTkal4E,comment-id=001b,timestamp=2015-05-19T03:48:53.410+0000)\n>\n> **First Thoughts**\n> He's basically the AD Carry version of Mordekaiser; ridiculously strong if you decide to go the full twelve rounds with him, but no way to make you actually stand and fight him the way he wants you to, especially since his range is low and his base MS is mediocre.

Stat theft is one of those things that always sounds more fun than it ends up being; you might know in your head that Trundle has stolen a bit of AD and nearly half your defenses, but it's hard to sense when you're actually on the rift. \n> \n> **Playstyle**\n> Whilst his abilities make me a little uneasy when taken individually, I actually like his kit as a whole except, ironically, for the one ability I really like in a vacuum; Aqueous Stream. I'm guessing part of the point of Aqueous Stream is to harass and clear waves without deactivating Ushio's passive, but when it comes to actual engages, there's no actual reason to use it over auto-attacks (unless your opponent has gotten out of range). His laning phase seems pretty good, so long as he's paired with a hard CC support; chaining a stun into his E is especially potent, plus his Q harass is probably quite strong. As a team fighter, he's terrible (as I assume he's intended to be); low mobility, short range, limited ability to shrug focus. On the other hand, if you ward up for him, he can hard shove with his Q and demand multiple enemies come to deal with him (or one Assassin, see below), or else he'll start chunking turrets.\n> \n> My main worry is his ability to basically say 'I win' when dueling bruisers mid to late game. Between the AD reduction on his ultimate and the damage reduction, your typical bruiser doesn't have much of an answer. On the other hand, he doesn't have much of a defense against Assassins at that point (even the AD ones), since he needs at least 4-5 seconds to actually become pseudo-tanky (and he'll be dead by that point). As a result, he's ridiculously high variance.\n> \n> **Kit Personality**\n> Much more 'marksman' than 'fish person', which is fine, since that seems to be more the slant you're going for. The main thing I think you could work on is that Ushio doesn't feel like the kind of champion for whom lines like \"I always hit my mark\" or \"There's no use trying to get away.\" make sense, considering A. he isn't exactly a champion with difficult to aim skill shots, nor especially long range and B. hes really not very good at chasing enemies down, nor bursting them. His lore and personality paint him like his kit should be either highly mobile/good for chasing (a la Vayne or Lucian) or long ranged and bursty (like Varus or, to a lesser extent, Caitlyn). His current kit feels more like it should belong on more 'scrappy' marksman like Graves, who can (theoretically) take as good as he gets. Right now, he's not the kind of guy who goes into your jungle and tries to hunt you down. He's the guy who shoves down lanes, wave clearing with his Q, and daring the enemy team to fight him or else he'll take turrets.\n> \n> **Suggestions**\n> \n> - Make his Q either a damage over time effect, make it interact with his passive or make it cancellable (if it isn't already). Whilst it's a useful wave clear tool, it feels like it doesn't fit in with the rest of his kit.\n> \n> - Increase the AOE on his E, but reduce the damage a little (possibly making it scale off total AD). By itself it's a little weak, but it's probably a little too strong when paired with a support's crowd control.\n> \n> - Perhaps a little extreme, but I'd personally change his ultimate completely. It doesn't really feel like it fits the personality of the hunter with amazing aim; it feels more at home on a 'gritty' ADC; someone who fights dirty or isn't afraid to get into the thick of it.\n> \n> - In general, he could do with something that stops him getting assassinated without being required to build Randuins/Banshee's Veil. Most short ranged ADCs have a defensive tool (Grave's Passive, Sivir's Spell Shield, Urgot's Shield/Passive) or a mobility tool/focus shrug ability (Vayne's tumble/invisibility, Lucian's dash, Quinn's Vault). Due to the ramp up time on his ultimate and passive, Ushio doesn't have the on demand durability to survive a burst combo, nor the GTFO power to put any kind of distance between him and his opponent. His only real answer is his silence, which against 80% of assassins, is easily dodgeable.\n\nFirst off, I want to thank you for taking the time to provide such thorough feedback. This is truly what I've needed for a long time.  I'll try to be equally thorough on my response.\n\n* I definitely agree with the Q changes. It is able to be canceled, but I should have added it.

Though the 21% damage reduction may be too much, perhaps somewhere around 12-15% would be better?\n\n* Perhaps a defensive ultimate would be helpful, as was intended with his original design where his whirlpool expanded to prevent enemies from getting to close to him, though this may be a little ill suited.

It will go a long way to improving Ushio :D\n\nEdit: I'm currently considering either a stealth ultimate, or perhaps making a different form of an early version of an ultimate I had designed, having his Whirlpool empower him and reduce damage from projectiles/skillshots, and increase his attack range during a time limit.

You might want to rewrite this ability as 'X damage per second' instead of 'X damage over X seconds' to prevent this kind of mix up. I've already said my piece on this ability as a concept.\n\n**New Ultimate - Vortex Shot**\n\nSo it teleports the target to where you aim the skill shot, I'm guessing? You might want to put a maximum range on how far the target can travel, since the ability to AA the target, then instantly TP them into your turret seems a _little_ strong. Also probably needs a base damage nerf; the fact you've listed it as having a total AD ratio rather than a bonus AD ratio means the burst is pretty strong.\n\nBTW, is it possible for enemy to be hit by both explosions? If it is, the damage is way too high.\n\nBTW, if you want an alternative, I had something from a couple of years back that you might like to take inspiration from. The formatting is pretty bad, but the idea is still there.\n\n> R - Gossamer Veil\n> For the next 3/3.5/4 seconds, Endelis is immune to the actions of all enemies from outside 450 range. The duration of this spell is increased by 1 second each time Vanishing Act is used. Additionally, this triples the MS gained from his passive. 120/100/80 seconds CD. 150 mana cost.\n> \n> Additional notes: Unlike Vanishing act or Vlad's pool, Gossamer Veil will immediately affect projectiles already in the air when used, allowing them to be 'disjointed'. Once the spell is active, you will be untargettable by enemies outside the AOE (to prevent RAEG at accidental wasted spells). Casting a spell inside the AOE and moving out of it will result in the spell still taking effect, whilst doing the opposite results in the spell taking no effect (assuming AOE; targetted spells are not useable).\n> \n> Explanation: For a short period, you can kite anyone and you can't be kited; fairly simple. Gossamer Veil makes Endelis a complete nightmare to fight with anyone who relies on a burst combo, especially those who use multiple targetted skills, like Veigar (nice ult). \n> \n\nWith current wording, it'd probably be more like 'blocks all projectiles'.","replies":[{"poster":"Keagn","date":"2015-06-05T04:57:58.186+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MalphiteThePower,realm=OCE,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=hiTkal4E,comment-id=001b00000000,timestamp=2015-06-05T04:11:18.377+0000)\n>\n> Sorry it took me so long to back around to looking at the updates.

I have two or three ideas lined up, but nothing solid.\n\nAs or Aqueous Stream, I see what you mean, and I agree with your solution. Not much more to say on it.\n\nNeither explosion actually damages the marked target as of now, but I do agree there needs to be a range limit similar to Expunge (or whatever they call it now) on Twitch. I actually like the potential plays that Vortex Shot could accomplish, and there may be some tweaks in the near future as far as damage, range, and explosion radii. I should have the indicator ranges and rewording up tomorrow or Saturday. \n\nThank you for your continued feedback and support!

Not so fast, my dear friend.\" A tall, furry creature chimes as the vortex in front of Ushio closes without his command. A wolf, presumably the one Gershom was talking about in his final moments, now stands in front of Ushio. The wolf's fur is a jet black and a small sword is attached to his waist, slapping his thigh as he walks towards the Marai. Upon further inspection, the sword's hilt is made out of a beautiful opal-studded coral and the blade is, shockingly enough, forged from none other than refurbished pearls. A truly gorgeous weapon, the wolf draws it and holds it out for Ushio to take.*\n\n*“A shame really that they had to die, but it doesn't necessarily mean this is the end of them. Take this blade, Ushio, as a token of my gratitude. It will aid you on your search for the Moon Stone or whatever it is your lost people are searching for.\"  The wolf, not explaining how he knows the sharpshooter's name, rests the blade in the Marai's hands.*\n\n*“What exactly do you mean by 'this isn't the end of them'\" The Marai questions, almost obviously upset about having to do this beasts dirty work. The strange blade rests at Ushio's side now, shining in the now harsh sunlight.*\n\n*“Even The soulless have a spirit, my dear Marai. And this one-\" Wolf cuts of his sentence as he walks over the spot where the goblin's body once lay,“- I am not entirely done with yet.\" As he finished his sentence, an otherworldly essences is absorbed into the wolf's fingertips.*\n\n*“You should get going now, sea dweller. Wouldn't want you to have to help us move our home now, do we?\" Wolf chuckles as the vortex reappears near Ushio. With pearl-blade at his side and Uzu's Pike in both hands, the Maria is almost pulled through it.*\n-----------------------------------\n\n*Later that evening, Gershom's eyes burn with an insatiable heat as the sun forces it's harsh rays down right on the grove in which he and Loi now lie. The goblin jerks upward and realizes he is in a jungle. Not home, not the Voodoo Lands, but a jungle clearing adorned with beautiful flowers and plant life. Sound asleep, the beast beside Gershom stirs, suggesting it is alive.*\n\n*“No way in hell that was a dream...\" The goblin sits now crisscrossed and staring at the scenery around him. Something on his right hand stings and the Goblin lifts it only to have his eyes widen at the sight. Embedded into the palm of his hand is a white gem with the insignia of a Pack Of Wolves inside of it.*\n\n*“The ruler of the underworld was quite stubborn when it came to giving you two up, but in the end I was able to...negotiate your freedom.\" Wolf sits, not too far away behind Gershom on a rock, wiping away a few drops of sickly blood from his fur. Another section of his fur was charred and a few scratches were visible on the Wolf's figure but Gershom didn't think much of it.*\n\n*“Now then, let me apologize for what the Wolf with the white fur did to you. I can't exactly...control him as well as I used to be able to. With that, I bid you two farewell.\" Wolf stand up from the rock he was once on and vanishes into the air.

Ushio had utilized the vortex manipulator of Uzu's Pike to shift Gershom out of harms way, as it was clear to the Sharpshooter that the creature would die regardless. Ushio focused his attention slowly on Ten. \"Enough. Your task is done,\" the Marai said, \"begone.\"*\n\n*The automaton made no movements, and Ushio began to understand what it wanted: spoils. Ushio willed his whirlpool to carry him onto the shore, over where what remained of Loi's skeleton began collapsing to dust. In its eye socket, however, the beast's lone gold eye remained unaltered. Ushio pried the eye from Loi's skull, causing what remained to break apart. It didn't matter anymore. Ushio receded his whirlpool so that his tail would transform into legs, and slowly but surely, he walked over to Ten, forcing the eye into its cold metallic hand.*\n\n*\"This is your master's proof,\" Ushio grumbled, \"now begone before you meet the same fate.\" The automaton seemed to need no other motivation than this to finally leave. Ten turned around, and slowly walked into the bay until it could no longer be seen. Ushio let loose a sigh, and then turned around to face the goblin, still bleeding on the ground. Ushio raised Uzu's Pike, ready to finish the job, but Gershom weakly raised a hand telling the Marai to wait. The goblin pulled out his dagger, holding it by the blade, and pointed the handle outwards toward the Sharpshooter. Reluctantly, Ushio retrieved the pitch black dagger, its blade cold as ice, felt the curve of the bone handle. The goblin tried to say something, but it was too faint for Ushio to hear.*\n\n*\"I never realized how badly the Wolf wanted me dead,\" Gershom whispered rather weakly, \"a mistake on my part, but I fear it is a much greater mistake on his. There will come a time when he needs me.\"*\n\n*\"I knew no 'Wolf' in this matter,\" Ushio replied, \"merely a **shaman** who told me this is what it would take to secure my race's survival.\"*\n\n*\"And you believed him?\"*\n\n*\"Not entirely. But I grow desperate for my people.\"*\n\n*\"Hmmm,\" Gershom thought aloud, \"well, I wouldn't trust this shaman either, if I were you that is. He seems to have gone to somewhat desperate lengths to get rid of me, and a desperate man is quite unpredictable, wouldn't you agree? All things are not as they seem.\" Gershom grabbed the Marai's hand that held his dagger, and forced it into his chest, draining away the chaotic energy that gave him strength. The goblin's body dissipated into a cloud of black smoke before blowing away in the wind, leaving the twisted blade the only evidence that he was here at all.*\n\n*Ushio twisted the ring on his finger, and Uzu's Pike disappeared in a brilliant yellow light. Ushio sheathed away the dagger in his belt, thinking he may find a better place for it on the Excursion when he returns. He so desperately needed to rest. The whispers of the deep urged his return, and the Sharpshooter felt a phantasmic urge to comply. He waved his hand over the waters, and they spun around to create a vortex back to his domain.*\n\n*\"The deed is done.\"*","replies":[]},{"poster":"Keagn","date":"2015-05-25T13:15:02.220+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"*Ushio could see the goblin and its one-eyed \"pet\", perhaps half a mile out from the bay, but closing the distance frighteningly quick for creatures with legs. The Sharpshooter reckoned he had about ten minutes, maybe less. Backup was running a little late...but Ushio didn't have time to wait. He just ran out of that. Uzu's Pike hummed in the water, anticipating the upcoming skirmish. It wasn't going to be pretty, but it might just get done. Ushio rose his rifle, lining his target down the sights, and took a moment or so while it got into position.*\n\n*\"Just a little closer...\"*\n\n*A stream of cyan light shot forth from the tip of Uzu's Pike, passing the demonic behemoth's club of a hand. A seemingly missed shot to the untrained eye. However, this was no missed shot. The stream of light hit the trap that Ushio had hid just moments before. A swarm of explosive lures sprung up from the ground, surrounding the goblin and brute. The flash of light that followed this event may have been visible within a several mile radius, only to be outdone by what followed.*\n\n*\"Gotcha.\"*\n\n*The explosion tore through the air in a pulsing , but did not damage the land, merely the target. When the light, explosion, and cloud of dust subsided, Gershom and Loi were no where to be seen. Ushio gritted his teeth. He wasn't an expert on how these creatures worked, but no remains was never a good sign. There was no telling how they escaped, but it would be in Ushio's best interest to be ready **when** they decided to show up.*\n\n*As if on queue, the crimson colored beast leaped over head ready to smash whatever unfortunate creature crossed its path. The Sharpshooter responded by firing a barrage of sea green flashes of light that tore through the creature's flesh as if in a feeding frenzy. Loi landed about four yards in front of Ushio, roughly the size of a maturing whale. Its silvery under-bite and lone gold eye struck fear in Ushio, something  he had not felt in quite some time. On its back, a sinister grey impish creature stood, perhaps a meter tall. Its fiery globes seemed to burrow into the Sharpshooter as to expose some sort of weakness. Damn midget seemed full of himself, perhaps rightfully so. But that doesn't mean Ushio was going to let **it** win.*\n\n*Ushio willed a whirlpool to form around him, lifting him straight overhead his foes. The Sharpshooter let loose a piercing wail, strong enough to peel back son of the crimson beast's skin. The creature could not defend itself from the piercing sound, and its master seemed to be using it as a meat shield to protect itself. When Ushio finally ceased, Loi was all but dead. The beast wasn't going to be moving for a while. A few minutes at least, which would be all the time the Sharpshooter needed.*\n\n*Ushio figured it was time to put his newest trick to use. The Sharpshooter leaped onto land, his tail transforming into a pair of able legs that he used to run across the land, firing several shots into to brutes back, as well as one in the goblin's shoulder, as he ran away. Apparently, this wasn't taken well. Gershom proceeded to ignite himself and his beast in an all-consuming violet inferno. This demonic blaze willed the beast to rise, and it would have seemed that this would be the Sharpshooter's end. Ushio was significantly outmatched, and lost the tremendous speed advantage he had in the water. A clear mistake, but it was too late to correct it.*\n\n*Fashionably late, a metal behemoth emerged from the bay and threw its shield at the goblin, knocking it off of Loi's back and onto the dirt. The giant automaton landed just behind the beast, generating a brand new shield which teemed with violent energy. Ushio aimed his rifle down at the fallen Gershom, now having a tactical advantage. He wasn't about to take out the goblin like this, however. Even in this, Ushio had rules he had to follow.*\n\n*\"Rise,\" Ushio instructed Gershom, \"I'm not going to kill you like this.\"*\n\n*\"Then I suppose it would be in my best interest to stay this way, wouldn't it?\" Gershom replied with a malicious grin on his face. It was clear, however, that the goblin's grin was wavering. There was no getting out of this. Even chaos had rules, and such rules were in play in this very moment. Ushio shot a look back at the automaton, a colossal metal figure with a slate for a face, depicting a barely visible \"10\" in black. Quite the reinforcements, Ushio thought to himself. The Sharpshooter tilted his head upward at Ten, signaling it to show they mean business. Apparently, the automaton understood the signal to some degree, as it bashed into Loi and knocked it onto the ground next to Gershom.*\n\n*Gershom anticipated what would have occurred if he did not act. The goblin leaped to his pet, and ignited them once more in an otherworldly violet inferno. Ten raised his shields, and Ushio re-positioned within the bay, allowing his tail to reform. He doubt the water would have any affect on these flames, but he would have far more mobility in his domain. Ushio willed a whirlpool to raise him high enough to where he could get a good shot of the goblin. After all, the goblin was the brains of the operation. The goblin may have been sentient, but the creature was simply another beast.*\n\n*Gershom raised a pitch black dagger to which he cut into Loi's flesh, causing it to charge after Ten. In response, the automaton formed a shield around its entire body, protecting itself from most of the incoming damage. Ushio responded with support fire, lighting up the beast's backside with a barrage of sea green light to damage Loi's vital points. Although not entirely effective, it did draw the creature attention, long enough for Ten to respond by charging into it, and knocking the creature off its balance. Ushio threw a lure in Loi's face and fired a shot so that the egg-shaped object detonated.*\n\n*The beast was knocked back, but not significantly damaged. Loi made a dive for Ushio like a bear fishing in a river, but the Sharpshooter was far too quick. Ushio managed to put several yards between him and the demonic duo before letting loose another dozen shots. Loi chucked Gershom at Ushio, but Ten passed over his shield to the Marai. Ushio caught the shield, and bashed the incoming goblin against it, causing some sort of explosion to launch Gershom back to shore. Ten and Loi broke into an all out brawl, each seeming to be a match for the other's raw strength. The beast kept smashing club against Ten's now blazing shield, but was unable to deal any real damage.*\n\n*It was now or never. Ushio aimed Uzu's Pike at the only location guaranteed to take the creature out: the head. After a deep breath, a stream of cyan light erupted from the Pike's spear-like barrel, piercing through Loi's head with little resistance. When the light subsided, Ten pushed the lifeless husk off of it,  the body already deteriorating to ash. Gershom looked in disbelief as his most valuable asset, and only friend, disappeared before his eyes. Loi had died in battle many times, experienced deaths far less graceful than this one, but somehow the Ravager knew in that moment that this death may have been the beast's last.*\n\n*There was no where left to run, but that didn't mean that the goblin had to go out quietly. Gershom melted into his own shadow, and leaped out from Ten's, with his dagger in hand. Ushio fired a sea green bolt into Gershom's leg, followed by two more in his chest. There was no fighting it now. Ten grabbed the goblin off its back and slammed it into the soil with a violent strength, almost as if the act was personal on some level. If the automaton could smile, it surely would have been, but undoubtedly the Wolf was undergoing the task for it.*\n\n(Continue to Part 2)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kamiroo Wolf","date":"2015-05-23T02:38:49.788+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"*“You know...this feels a bit funny, in a way.\" Wolf smiles to himself as his newest automaton, Ten, stretches it's metallic legs on the shoreline.

On the face of the newest automaton, a scratchy and almost illegible black 10 can be seen.*\n\n*“Three, if you would please spar with our newest ally I could work out the kinks in his system.\" Wolf waves over the automaton with a cool blue 3 on her face. The sleek metal figure leaps from her position beside One and lands gracefully in front of Ten with two dual broadswords in each hand. On queue, Ten raises his arms and two rectangular shields of energy form, one red and one blue.*\n\n*“Sir, I apologize for questioning you, but why not have One conjure an army for our newest automaton to spar with?\" Apologetic as ever, Three gets into stance, not expecting an answer from her creator.

Shields take 15% of the basic attack damage Ten receives and reduce damage taken by 5% for each shield currently activ. When a shield's health drops to zero(or when Ten throws it), the automaton must wait 5 seconds for a new random one to generate. The abilities, functions, and durability(100-300 health) of the new shield depend on what it is. Just a few of the different shields can be found here, and for the rest, just use your imagination.\n\n**Spinning Wrath=Q)**\nTen launches both of his shields in a narrow straight line skill shot and each shield deals 30/70/110/150/190(+50% Armor)(+70% Magic Resist). If the enemy happens to get hit with both shields, they will get stunned for 1.5 seconds.\n\nCooldown: 7 seconds.\n\n**Take my shield!=W)**\nFrom a range, Ten throws the shield on his right hand onto a target ally, increasing their armor and magic resist by 8/16/24/32/40(+10% Armor) for 3 seconds. The ally will also gain whatever side effect this shield had. For instance, applying the Shield Of Thorns to an ally would give them a thornmail buff while applying the Shield Of Phantoms would give allow them to ignore unit collision. Of course this effect is random.\n\nCooldown: 12 seconds.\n\n**Bash, Rush, and Repeat=E)**\nTen charges in a target direction, knocking back and dealing 10/20/30/40/50(+100% Armor) physical damage before stunning the victim for 3/4 of a second.

According to his information, the goblin and his beast should be here within the next few hours. Ushio kept thinking over the information the shaman had given him, but the details were vague at best. The only certainties that the Sharpshooter could rely on were that  he had to take both of the demons out to end this, and couldn't afford to venture far from the water. Perhaps half a mile beneath Ushio was some sort of structure that he suspected housed the sponsor Vishas had mentioned. He didn't know why the goblin wanted whoever was down there, and frankly Ushio didn't care. Right now, his only concern was taking care of business.*\n\n*Ushio gritted his teeth. He hated the idea of helping the land dwellers clean up their messes. He had no quarrel with these creatures, no true reason to kill them.  But the land dwellers had something the Marai so desperately needed. If Ushio's morals were to be corrupted in exchange for the Marai's survival, then so be it. In the eyes of his people, he would be a hero. A savior. For the sake of his people, he told himself, Gershom and Loi had to die.*\n\n*Even this far from the sea, Ushio could still hear the whispers of the abyss. They confirmed only what Ushio already knew, that this had to be done. Ushio had learned much from the voices, information seemingly lost in time had been revealed to him through their guidance. He had the abyss to thank for the Excursion, for Uzu's Pike, for power, and for the warning of the impending threat the land dwellers had allowed to arise. He owed much of his success to these voices. But he would be lying if he didn't suspect of having ulterior motives...*\n\n*Ushio bobbed on the surface of the water, scouting the bay for anything that was approaching his location. Hopefully, the back up he was promised would arrive before his targets, but the Sharpshooter couldn't depend on that. A warrior has to be ready for any and all scenarios, and Ushio wasn't going to let this be any different. He approached the shoreline slowly but surely, and allowed the tide to recede from his tail, which faded away in a blur of sea green light. Ushio stumbled onto land, one hand clutching Uzu's Pike, the other planted firmly on the ground. Ushio opened his eyes, and fixed his eyes onto his lower half. Two silvery grey blue legs with coral red-orange webbing now supported him in his odyssey, as well as a far more maneuverable tail. Ushio attempted to raise himself from his crouched position, but found the strange sensation of legs beneath him not yet at his command, and his stumbled forward, using his rifle to support his weight.*\n\n*The first of his kind to walk on land.*","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kamiroo Wolf","date":"2015-05-20T23:01:22.725+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> **Your Target:** Gershom & Loi\n> **Name:** Gershom & Loi\n> **Location: **Somewhere near Piltover and Zuan, perhaps the Voodoo Lands.\n> **Description Of Capabilities:**\n>  - Perfect synergy in battle with one another.\n>  - Control over dark and demonic flame.\n>  - Dastardly spellwork originating from Voodoo Lands\n>  - Must kill both to completely defeat them.\n>\n> **Description:**\n>  A dangerous goblin and his pet beast from the Voodoo Lands.

The E was a really corner stone piece which put together this concept for me, because for a week or so it was just this Q idea and a half-assed kit.

This word was foreign to the Sharpshooter. Still, if it involved taking out targets, it didn't much matter what the targets were. The creatures of the deep were quick, yet Ushio never so much as missed a shot. As he hovered over the shoreline awaiting his opposition, Ushio began to wonder why he had even responded to the land dwellers' request for assistance, let alone agreed to this so called \"training\". But at the end of the day, these strange air-breathing creatures had something he needed.*\n>\n>*\"Alright shark bait, I'm ready when you are!\" Ushio shouted across the beach. For a moment, nothing seemed to happen, then all of a sudden five strange figures emerged from the shadows of palm trees. They did not have shape at first, but quickly adapted and took a similar shape to Ushio's, seemingly floating over the sands. The Sharpshooter could faintly distinguish little circular targets which faintly glowed within each of the figures' centers. Sprouting from these cores were thin metal joints giving the ghoulish figures some sort of framework. If all Ushio had to do was take out these so called \"automatons\", then this mission was going to be a piece of crab-cake.*\n>\n>*\"WELL COME ON THEN! I DON'T BITE!\" Ushio shouted with a grin and a whisper under his breath...*\n>\n> ######*\"Hard.\"* \n>\n>*One by one the metal figures charged towards Ushio in a sort of jagged pattern in attempt to throw off the Sharpshooter's aim, but instead Ushio just kept his rifle lined down the center. Closer and closer they came, but still Ushio just aimed down his sights, waiting. When they came within about seven yards, Ushio willed his whirlpool to spin faster and he shot back into the waters to gain  some distance, but maintained his aim. A stream of sea green light shot forth from the spear-like tip of Uzu's Pike straight down the line, piercing through two of the automatons which dissipated in a pair of fiery explosions.*\n>\n >*This only caught the remaining three by surprise for a moment, but that's all Ushio needed. The Sharpshooter tossed an egg shaped object at his foes, only to have it phase through them and plop into the sand. A moment later the egg sprung into the air and radiated a captivating glow which drew the automatons towards it. Ushio took this as signal to fire of three more glowing sea green projectiles, hitting two of the automatons, and the last shot hitting the glowing egg which exploded as a result. The final automaton narrowly dodged the explosion, and positioned itself about twenty yards away from Ushio in the shadow of a palm tree.*\n>\n>*The mechanization sunk away into the darkness, leaving Ushio the only thing moving on the beach. The Sharpshooter let out a wild grin, obviously pleased with himself. He held his rifle at rest, and held the other arm outward, shouting \"Is that all you got?\" loud enough that it may have been audible for a quarter-mile in each direction. It was then that the final automaton emerged from Ushio's own shadow, ready to strike. Ushio quickly utilized his whirlpool to spin around one-hundred and eighty degrees and let out a deafening shriek which rendered the mechanization immobile, slowly shattering its major components. The continued sound wave became to much for the automaton to bear, and so it collapsed helplessly into the shallow waters before shutting down completely.*\n>\n> *Ushio renewed his devilish grin once more and starred out towards the ocean.Just like I said, he thought to himself...* \n>\n>*...crab-cake.*","replies":[]},{"poster":"Keagn","date":"2015-05-03T20:49:05.357+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think I'm going to do something different for the art on this concept.

What would be your suggestions to balance it?","replies":[]}]}]}]}
