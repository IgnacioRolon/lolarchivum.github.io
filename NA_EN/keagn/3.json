I&#039;m planning far larger entries for the Dragon and Baron Nashor (more details on anatomy, encounter, etc), which means that they&#039;ll ultimately take a bit longer, but will be loaded up with all sorts of additional whatnots for your enjoyment.\r\n\r\nBut for now, enjoy the long awaited Blue Sentinel!!!

The idea of a kind of natural historian of Runeterra is really appealing :)  To the writing, there are some parts where it reads a little less smoothly than others.  For example:\n\n> This would usually result in the Sentinels being damaged almost beyond repair, so a pair of sentries **was** made for each Sentinel who would not only provide early warning for danger but would draw forth energy from the earth faster so that the Sentinels could repair themselves. \n\nThat's quite the sentence!  Also, I think the use of \"was\" is wrong - and should probably be \"were\".  I find the use of the words \"sentries\" and \"sentinels\" to be quite close too - causing me to have to stop and re-read.

I try to read through them, but I just fixed it, and changed the attachment accordingly. Although since Blue Sentinels and Sentries are what they're called, there's only so much I can do, it may be something to think about another day.\n\nThank you for the support! I think it'd be super cool to make a printed version, I definitely have a lot more in store with the Dragon and Baron, assuming the effects and what not turn out.","replies":[]}]}]}
