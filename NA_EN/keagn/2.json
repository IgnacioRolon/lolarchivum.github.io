As one of the boss monsters, a little extra love went into the Dragon, including an additional two pages (depending on how you look at it, more or less). I am by no means an expert at what I&#039;m doing, but I learn and try different things as I go along. Hopefully it pays off, because this is nothing compared to what I have planned for Baron Nashor. I might do another page or so for Dragon and attach it later, but as it stands, it&#039;s looking pretty. \r\n\r\nAs you may or may not know, I also planning on doing  Bilgewater/Burning Tides journal entries as well, probably going to come with a different author. This will be made obvious in a variety of ways, all for your guys&#039; enjoyment.  \r\n\r\nAny who, that&#039;s enough from me, enjoy!","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2015-07-18T20:14:07.200+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"You've outdone yourself this time :)  The added 'photograph' is great fun and the scales really push it over the top!\nYou said you've learned things as you've done these - can you explain a little about what you've found does and doesn't work?  I'd be interested to hear about your journey from the first attempts to these latest examples.","replies":[{"poster":"Keagn","date":"2015-07-18T20:52:32.472+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Every visual representation that you see starts with one that has already existed (such as the paper, images of creatures, etc), and so the challenge (besides writing a fun description/analysis that explores the creature) is arranging and utilizing everything in such a way that it looks fresh, and feels authentic. \n\nNot being a top of the line artist creates added limitations, as it effects more so what I can present, but it also means I can explore different alternatives. When I first created the Red Brambleback, the text description was already provided by Sharjo, but how I was going to create an artistic representation of the creature was completely up in the air. I could have tried to draw them, but I quickly found photocopying wasn't my friend, and my skills with a mouse was not enough to create something appealing.\n\n When looking for reference images, I had found the model image with a blue background that Surrender@20 had posted, and I came up with an idea that kind of defined what people think of as far as the journal entries go. The program I was using (GIMP) had a \"Select by Color\" tool, which helped with not only getting rid of unwanted backgrounds, but posed the basis for the \"ink drawings\" of the creatures. By selecting several colors on the image I found on Surrender@20, and painting over it in black, it looked like a fairly authentic ink drawing of the Brambleback!\n\nAs I kept doing these, I slowly got better and more efficient on how I did things (being able to invert the selection to clear away anything unwanted when making the creature images, until a lot of people requested Gromp. Gromp proved to be exceedingly difficult for creating the \"artist representation\", because the one image I could find (that would work with what I could do at the time) was one with his tongue phasing through his face. Additionally, the way my Color Selection tool recognized the colors was a bit different, making it difficult to get a working profile of him.\n\nI eventually overcame this by doing some slight editing near his mouth, and altered the Color Selection so that its recognition of colors was a bit simpler, making it easier to get a working image, more or less. From there, it was pretty consistent, although I desperately wanted to add in extra things: bark from the Brambleback, a mushroom from Gromp, fur from Murk Wolves, or even feathers from the Razorbeaks. There was simply no resources that I could use though, so I had to settle a bit. \n\nThe paper background I rolled with eventually drove me crazy, because there was ink in the bottom left, and top right corners, as well as a simple pair of spectacles or something, but I had to keep rolling with it. When it came to the Dragon though, which would have more pages, I knew I couldn't get away with it. So I played with some tricks of sort.\n\nBy this point my editing skills have gotten better, not good enough to cut out the top right corner and patch the paper, but better. I was able to edit out the single scale from the Dragonslayer promotion, and by overlaying a bunch of copies, it made a nice sheet of dragon scales which I could lay over the top right corner.\n\nI won't reveal \"all\" of my tricks, but I do want to explain the photograph slightly. I figured the world of Valoran had cameras, as Zac's teaser and reveal had old time photographs, so it was justifiable to add one in myself. The picture was a frame from the Work in Progress reveal of Summoner's Rift, and then I had used a screenshot of Prehistoric Anivia's egg form for the dragon baby. With a few filters, and touch ups, I had a working old-timey photo of a dragon protecting its offspring. \n\nI think doing the Dragon, and planning out Baron Nashor has made me want to branch out a bit more, and up the quality, as these creatures are the bosses. I did several more ink representations, additional pages, and some added \"wow\" factors like scales, photographs, and burn marks. Maybe as I learn more tricks, and build up some resources, I'll be able to do more things, or even go back and touch up old ones.\n\nGosh, sorry if I went on about this too much. I hope I explained myself well enough, and I'm glad to have created something that both the community, Rioters, and myself enjoy. I'd love to see Riot do something similar one day, perhaps. I think there's a lot of potential with the resources you guys have vs those that I have, but it doesn't make what I do any less enjoyable in the meantime ^_^","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2015-07-18T21:22:23.175+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Keagn,realm=NA,application-id=2XjzURgc,discussion-id=sQWBkB2E,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2015-07-18T20:52:32.472+0000)\n>\n> ...Gosh, sorry if I went on about this too much.

I asume the person that added the scales and photo is the same that wrote the text, and if i were that person, i would try to not cover up my text with that.\n\nI would first like to say thank you, and I suppose follow up with an explanation of why it is what it is. The paper image I use is the same for all journal entries, so its always going to have the two ink bottles and quills, along with a pair of tiny spectacles. The scales provided a way of changing it up a little, and yes it covers a bit of the text (I think about 5 words), but it adds a bit extra without taking away too much content.\n\nAs for the picture, it only covers up part of one word (\"hatches.\"), so while the positioning is a bit inconvenient, it also doesn't take too much away from the text as a whole.\n\nIf I had better resources to use, there's not a doubt that I'd do a lot of things differently (I seriously wish I could do an interactive version of the journal that readers could just flip through), but I do the most with what I can. I'll keep your feedback in mind when designing the additional Dragon pages (more were requested specifically about the Dragon of Summoner's Rift), as well as the Baron pages (Likely 6-7, which means 3-4 images).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"A Superb Villain","date":"2015-07-18T22:18:58.080+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have always enjoyed your Journal series and appreciate the work you have put into them.

Also as far as the corner decorations, a lot of them (the tiny glasses, ink bottles, quills) I'm stuck with, unless I go back and edit each Journal Entry. It's the background that I chose when I first started all of this, not of my own making, sadly (I don't have the resources for it :c ). \n\nI definitely think another two pages on Summoner's Rift particular dragon would be amazing. I've been hesitant to name the creature (as I'm not Riot, and they may later provide content that contradicts it), but if people are up for it, I would love nothing more than to name the Dragon. The boss monsters are always deserving I'd like to think. \n\nIf I did start adapting the journal to new paper, I may be able to find a usable version of the letters in Rek'Sai's teaser and work from there. Its all a matter of getting the right resources together. The only one that'd be difficult to convert may be the first set of Dragon pages, but its nothing that can't be worked around.\n\nI'd love to get Riot in on this one day, though I understand they have bigger things to take care of. But better assets to work with would be killer! I mentioned a bit of it when replying to Bioluminescence, about including maybe pelts/scraps of fur, feathers, Sentinel shards, Brambleback bark, a Gromp Mushroom, and so on. I got lucky with the dragon scales being available through the Dragonslayer promo, and yeah the lighting is a bit off because they're all the same scale, and I'm a writer more so than an artist (though there's more art of mine in the Boards than there are stories I think), so nothing will be \"perfect\" sadly, but I can still do a pretty good job I'd like to think.\n\nPS: Super cool Summoner's name.
