I'm looming in on graduating high school in December of 2015, and more than anything I want to join the ranks of Riot Games. I'm aiming for the concept art department, but I also want to keep flexible to improve what I can offer to Riot ^_^ My question is this: What all do I need as far as schooling and skills, and what on top of this would improve my chances? I've been self learning sculptris for 3-D modeling, and I'm doing online courses in javascript for introduction into coding. I've looked through the resources for job openings, as well as the LinkedIn information, but I would like to get into the specifics more, and maybe clearer forms of information. I know its unrealistic to expect to get up to where you all are without some serious effort, but I'm eager, and willing to work for it!\r\n\r\nIn addition, if you want to ever talk kit or champion concepts, I'm your man :D","replies":[]}
