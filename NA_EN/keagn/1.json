I actually haven't seen a scuttle respawn though, though you see it moving back underground to its location when it dies. I'll take your word for it, and update Scuttle Crab's entry to support this, and remove the burden of guilt on the Scuttle Crab attackers.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sooko","date":"2015-02-09T17:46:19.232+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Poor scuttle :C","replies":[]},{"poster":"PickleBabah","date":"2015-02-09T03:45:54.538+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"When near death, the Scuttle Crab will flee in a series of erratic movements in attempt to confuse the attacker.\"\n\nTrue, so true.

I recommend giving them a look as well.
