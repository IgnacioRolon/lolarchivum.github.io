Recently after about 2 weeks I was finally able to save enough IP for Ekko and i think it took a little long to get the IP to do so. I play as often as I can but is still takes me a while since I'm not very good at the game. Overall I just want RP and IP. Please and thank you.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-09T18:42:22.431+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hope you had a great birthday!  I like your summoner icon to match the occasion.  :D  We don't really give out free IP or RP, so I couldn't help with that.
