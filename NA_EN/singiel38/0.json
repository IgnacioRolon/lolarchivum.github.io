I almost gave up. I have slow internet connection and very little time. Now it's probably too late, so long. My connection is unstable. My internet is easily shut down. My problem is that when the connection break, the installation starts all over again. That's why I'm stuck for a few days. When I got something like 22% patching off, suddenly my connection broke up and patching started again 0. Now I have 5% patches and 170 minutes waiting for patch. If the installed files were \"remembered\" for installation, I could do 60% patches, and even more. I do not know if I could fully install the patch then.\r\n\r\n######Sorry for my English.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-06-08T21:54:10.437+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"BiIiBili's comment is pretty accurate.  Failing to patch and getting an error can result in corrupted game files, so the patcher has to rescan your game files to make sure everything is okay and prepare to update your files again.  \n\nHaving an unstable conneciton sucks, and it's really important that gets improved before doing anything else.  Try out the steps in the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to help tighten up your network to the patching server.  \n\nEven if it's slow, it's crucial to let it keep doing it's thing, as cancelling early can similarly result in game file problems.","replies":[{"poster":"singiel38","date":"2017-06-09T10:32:55.604+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"After losing my connection, there's no any error, it just starts from 0% without any warnings. I can't keep up patching to 50%, before that I'm getting random DC's. I think I can't improve my connection because I belong in the worst internet provider in my country, officially it's the worst, last on ranking. Apparently I have no chance to patch that game with my 0.52 mbps. I'll try the guide, but I'm skeptical about it. Thank you for advices anyways. I've left my patching for whole night and it was 19% patching done.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BiIiBili","date":"2017-06-08T20:33:42.015+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While Patching, if the internet connection was lost, it can easily result in damaged/corrupted file.
