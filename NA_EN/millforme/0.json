The only relation we are given is between her and her teachers. Her LUNARI teachers.  I can&#039;t possibly imagine the culture she&#039;s a part of.\r\n\r\nThat being said, Zoe is a child. Children are taught to respect authority. Children are taught consequences and their meanings. Children have brains that are still growing and are incapable of processing and handling everything the same way a grown adult would on their own. Her inability to understand the vast consequences of her actions, emotionally and morally, is a real possibility.\r\n\r\nThis is a child who does not understand the reason she should value her studies and their value. This is a child who would rather have more fun, while cornered by her authoritative figures, than diffuse their stress and anger, or even escape it.\r\n\r\nThis same child, is suddenly given the ability to explore the world. She&#039;s able to do this and is only limited when it is time to do her job. She does not need to live with the consequences of a destroyed town. She does not need to meet the families of those killed in her adventures. She is able to see the end of the lives of mortal creatures.\r\n\r\nZoe is a child that is able to pet Aurelion Sol against his wishes.\r\n\r\nUnder no circumstances would I call her a hero, but she IS a child to me. A child that faces no consequences to her actions. A child that may very well have no real relationship that encourages growth and maturity in her.\r\n\r\nI love Zoe&#039;s character, honestly. I think the reality surrounding Zoe&#039;s existence and the gravity of her presence is done well.\r\n\r\nAnd I do have one question because I didn&#039;t see it in a red post yet: Does Zoe ignore time when she travels?","replies":[{"poster":"WAAARGHbobo","date":"2017-11-21T20:16:33.181+0000","up_votes":32,"down_votes":21,"body":"Correct.  Zoe does not experience time in the same way we do.   \n\nObviously, she can travel faster-than-lightspeed--but also she is connected to multiple realities and (if you look carefully) she is connected and able to perceive the past, future and spirit world in a very different way than we can.   \n\nOne of the things that struck me when researching her was the disregard tricksters have for rules and norms --including respecting life-and-death.   \nLoki, coyote, Peter-Pan, etc...  After looking into them for a while and checking my Jung-- I noticed that tricksters have subtextual commentary on death and a connection to it as truth bringers, jokers, and rule-breakers.   Often because the trickster hold (sometimes subconsciously) a secret knowledge--  i.e. they know death: is not real,  is preordained, is part of cycle, etc...     \n\nThen deciding if part of a tricksters and herald's job is to prepare you for some hard truths and change-- I looked at  Zoe as needing to exist as a sort of Zen Koan.   Many, many of Zoe's lines have double meanings  (including the word \"sparkles\") and can be understood more than one way. \n\nThree side notes:\n1) There is a weird space parasite thing some people are hung up on for the Targonians--  I have no idea where that came from.   --From my understanding the Aspects _merge_ with a person-- except for Pantheon-- he's a dick-- he only keeps your sense of duty and thirst for glory.  (Shrug maybe that makes him the perfect warrior)     \n\n2)  Everyone somehow believes Aurelion Sol-- hates Zoe.   Nope.  There relationship is closer to Loki and Thor (in myth not marvel)   They are sorta friends-- but he knows not to trust her.     And in fact she is his best hope of getting free-- after he learns some stuff he needs.   \n\n3) Zoe did not destroy the town, only the guards attacking her and the tower.  \n\n\nBonus:\nA question for you to consider.  In the color text (story) why would this be the way the aspect needed the world-rune to be found?","replies":[{"poster":"Fasmodey","date":"2017-11-21T20:37:02.833+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"Why is power level between Aspects significantly large?

I personally never interpreted the \"space parasite\" thing, but I can see how it could be confusing for some readers. I think in order to clear this misconception you first need to **show** us who these champions are. I'm gonna go a bit into depth so bear with me.\n\nI think the whole \"space parasite\" thing started with the Leona, Panth and Diana updates a year or so ago. But mainly Leona. (I'll talk about Panth last cause he's a special case.)\n\nSo for Diana and Leona, the main things is that prior to the updates a year ago, they didn't really have much characterizations. So the only characterizations the community had was their perception of these characters. \n\nFor Diana, much of the community felt her characterization was done right for the most part. People viewed Diana as a tragic character who was more of an anti-hero than evil. The only complaint I remember seeing was that they felt it was out of character for her to slaughter all the Solari priests. Many people felt that it was unnecessary for her to kill them, she could've used her moon powers to escape instead. Since she wasn't in any real danger, people felt that the killings were unnecessary and malicious rather than result of a he being in a tragic situation, forced to do what it takes to survive. This mischaracterization along with (if I remember correctly) references to, for lack of better words, \"moon senses' tingling probably lead to the idea of the Moon Aspect being a space parasite. While I agree that Diana was mischaracterized,( I don't view her as a character that would kill unnecessarily), I never I never interpreted as the Aspect controlling her mind, just mischaracterization.\n*  I'm just spit-balling, but I think a better way of giving Diana her powers would have been something along these lines: After presenting her finding from the ancient Lunari temple, Diana is taken into custody. She imprisoned, tortured and humiliated for weeks . The only way to live is to denounce her heretical ways. Refusing to deny her faith, she is sentenced to death. On the execution block she says one last prayer. Seeing her devotion, the Aspect of the Moon spares her life and imbues her with power. She does what she needs to escape and survive.\n\nLikewise, for Leona, the \"space parasite\" idea spawned from mischaracterization. Similarly, the community's general perception of Leona came from a general speculation and a collective idea of who she is. The community viewed her as a caring protector. They felt that her updated story portrayed her as blood thirsty zealot. While I disagree that she was characterized as a blood thirsty zealot, her kinda nature wasn't emphasized well enough either and I can definitely see were people are coming from. However, I do think some people were over exaggerating. After she **is** a warrior and does have a sword not just for show. Another thing that people didn't like was her ascension changed her whole point of view. This was probably the most \"space parasite\" thing in her story. \"First she's blinded by rage but after she gets the power of the Sun Aspect she's suddenly not mad anymore\" is what some people interpreted. Although I understand what you were trying to convey was that Leona was shown information by the Sun Aspect that broaden her perspective on things, I think you handled it poorly and came across closer to \"space parasite\" than what you envisioned.\n* Once again, I'm just spit-balling ideas. I think to clear some things up... 1) You could've shown Leona's caring side better. I think a good way would've been to make Leona and Diana know each other prior to them receiving their powers. Having Leona be the only one to accept Diana and make her feel welcome would've been a much more meaningful piece of background than her saving some weird random golden goat fella. Personally I would've liked to have seen them have somewhat of a close relationship but even a friendly acquaintanceship would've been great. Either way, a prior connection would've been awesome. 2)You could've made Leona not present when Diana killed the Solari elders which ties into my next point. 3) Given Leona her powers before Diana slew her elders 4)You could've made Leona's rage towards Diana more nuanced. As I stated earlier, a lot of people found Leona's burning rage uncharacteristic of her. I somewhat disagree with people's outrage towards that. I mean, she is human after all and even someone as caring a Leona would feel deep rage if their loved ones were slain. Having said that, by making Leona and Diana have a previous relationship and making her not present during her elders' death, Leona's path to confront Diana turns from pure rage to mixed emotions of rage, pain, disappointment, betrayal and sorrow. Rather than wanting to just \"kill the heretic\" she most of all wants to know \"Why, Diana?\". Secondly, by giving Leona her powers before her elder's death it could add to the mixed bags of emotions she's feeling. She had the power to protect  the elders from Diana and Diana from the elders, but she failed at both. 5) You could've left out the magic \"sun knowledge\" from Leona's change of heart. I would rather see a change of heart come from them confronting each other. I want to see their relationship grow through reluctant acceptance each other's flaws, change, personal growth, forgiveness and understanding. I'm not saying that wasn't already possible, but I think simply talking rather than \"divine visions\" would've been a better starting point.\n\n\nAs for Pantheon he **really** didn't have much characterization beforehand, not even a collective community identity other than \"Spartan guy\". This was the change that most strongly solidified the \"space parasite\" idea, because in this case it is true. People's complaint was that you basically said \"Hey! Remember this guy with no personality? Yeah, he has no personality, bye!\". Having said that, I really like the premise and I think everybody would've liked it if you made literally **one** change. Change Atreus' name to Pantheon and name the Aspect something else (Aspect of War/Rage/Death whatever). Literally that one change would've made a big difference. The reason I say this is because people viewed Pantheon as the **man** with a spear and shield. Sure he had no personality, but they were **interested** in **learning** what his personality was with the updated lore. Pantheon was **never** some space god of war, he was the Rakkoran warrior with a spear and shield. If you switch every instance of \"Atreus\" with \"Pantheon\", already he gets some much needed characterization. He's loyal, tactical and unyielding. He's a perseverant character that people want to root for. Also, I remember you guys teasing that Atreus wasn't completely lost. In addition, to changing Atreus' name to Pantheon and making it clearer that his mind was still fighting the Aspect, \"Pantheon\" could've been one of the most badass characters in League. The first human vessel to fight off  and possibly tame the Aspect of War.\n\nAs for Taric, I'm happy with him and I think so is the community.\n\nSorry for this being so long. Targon's lore is important to me since Diana and Leona are my mains and I really like them so I'm a bit passionate about them.\n\nI hope you have the time to read and respond to this.\n\nEdit: Holy shit this is a long post.","replies":[{"poster":"Morning Raven","date":"2017-11-23T06:20:01.942+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Someone give this Star Guardian a familiar.

(Shrug maybe that makes him the perfect warrior) \n\nThat would be me.\n\nYou guys wrote a bunch of lore where a person meets an alien (specifically not a god by the way) from space, that has a space empire.  And after their meeting their personalities are described as eternally changed, and we even have several characters pull a complete 180 on their emotional states and personal missions.  And some have the aspects take over either in brief moments or for all time.\n\nThat's a space parasite if ever I heard one.\n\nMostly, it also comes from.  So far you haven't shown the other Aspects being anything else except psychotic murdering dicks.  From Diana's taking over to kill some old priests.  To Leona's being all burn happy with killing bandits.  To Zoe's sticking this irresponsible child with godlike power and just letting her nuke a town.  To Pantheon, who is the king asshole.  Taric's ok so far.\n\nAnd worst of all.  It's gone on so long, I don't even care about them.  I don't care about their mystery or their motivation.  I just want these parasites to go away and stop messing with people.","replies":[{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2017-11-21T21:51:29.465+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Diana killed priests before in her old lore so not much really changed. \n\nThough I agree on Pantheon.
