In the past he could adapt with items however with recent changes and additions it has become impossible to do so. Singed's kit does not fulfill its role anymore resulting in the champion not having an identity anymore. Singed as a champion is victim to a lot of indirect changes thus Riot has unintentionally nerfed him into the ground over time. The statistics about the champion's positioning is inflated as only dedicated mains play him, resulting in his win rate/difficulty being inaccurate. Singed does not need a massive rework, however his passive must be changed and his other spells adjusted to correspond with recent changes.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nIntroduction\t\n\nHello, my name is Noe &ndash; I main Singed on three accounts, one in NA and two in Korea and to be honest, I am very concerned with the state of Singed at the moment. Actually, Singed has been in a troubling spot that gets worse every season &ndash; but this season, us Singed main&rsquo;s just can&rsquo;t adapt anymore, for a number of reasons. I know you all at Riot don&rsquo;t feel the same way, so I hope to make my case as to why people think Singed is good &ndash; but actually isn&rsquo;t.  Why Singed deserves your attention. I really hope you watch this video, I want to believe that Riot listens to player feedback and that you care even a little &ndash; especially since the designers claim that Singed holds a little special place in you&rsquo;re their heart. Don&rsquo;t let that stop you from making tweaks to his kit. \n\nWhy Buff Singed\n\nFirst of all, I want to make very clear what I think Singed needs. I don&rsquo;t think  he needs a full rework &ndash; none of us want Singed to be OP &ndash; especially Singed mains, I just think Singed could use a few lifestyle changes that can help Singed feel like playing Singed again. You may call them buffs, I want to think of them more as adaptations to an ever changing game.\nNow why change Singed? The data shows that he is in a good spot right, around 50% usually? I would like to point out that I believe your data and sample size on Singed is wrong, it is skewed. This is because the only people who play Singed are Singed mains for the most part. We have been playing Singed for a long time, we have a very active reddit community, and many of us stream or even make youtube videos to help other Singed players. We keep Singed&rsquo;s winrate up because of our hard work and dedication. We play him no matter how bad it gets and find ways to stay relevant despite the difficulty.\nBut this season is different, as it stands, it just doesn&rsquo;t feel rewarding playing Singed and it just isn&rsquo;t fun &ndash; it&rsquo;s not fun at all. In fact, so many Singed mains have quit, myself included &ndash; I don&rsquo;t intend on playing again until he is &ldquo;fun&rdquo; at least. Seriously, I don&rsquo;t even care about winning, I just want to have fun. By having fun I mean having those &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t&rsquo; chase the Singed moments.&rdquo; I can&rsquo;t recall the last time I had a moment like that.  \n\nSinged History\n\nTo talk about Singed presently I must talk a little about the past. Singed comes from an era where champions were for the most part immobile. These days though, there are champions that can get from one side of the screen to the other with much ease &ndash; and most importantly without items. Basically, there is too much mobility in the game, mobility that makes it extremely difficult for Singed to either catch anyone &ndash; or run away from. \n\nHe also had tenacity back then &ndash; which even I can agree was OP for that time. But I feel like that time is different now, because where it used to be that maybe one or two champions had CC &ndash; these days every champion seems to have CC built right into their kit. Repeatable CC. Champions can blink away, dash, jump over walls, or simply run away from Singed so easily. There&rsquo;s champions that can steal a percentage of your MS &ndash; items too.  Even the champions that Singed used to counter, now counter him. Reworks like Fiora or Poppy have make Singed feel unimpactful. Singed was meant to counter melee &ndash;  Singed should be scary in melee range, but he isn&rsquo;t. \n\nIt was also a time where there were few items in the game and the items that Singed wanted to build fit very well with his kit. A great example of this is Banshees veil  &ndash; Singed wanted and it included Mana to complement his passive. He used to build frozen heart also, but thornmail is simply better in most situations now. Back then you could build Tear and ROA because there were not other choices &ndash; now there are better choices with the much needed utility to be useful. .\nOk &ndash; so we used to build Mana and now we don&rsquo;t. Why? Mainly because the items we want to use now to help us stay relevant don&rsquo;t contain mana except for RG. We need the utility to be able to enter a fight and to leave it. \nWe then began using Rylais and Liandri&rsquo;s and building full tank. That was the only way to play Singed effectively. Until it wasn&rsquo;t, so we began to build Singed full tank. If you didn&rsquo;t build full tank. You will die. The amount of CC and damage in this game is so much &ndash; you cannot afford to go hybrid anymore. \n\nHowever, building full tank on Singed makes you really useless as Singed is not a real tank, nor is he supposed to be an initiator &ndash; I believe you classify him as a disruptor. Yet, we are expected to build RG, deadmans plate, ZZ&rsquo;Rot &ndash; just to be able to initiate. He isn&rsquo;t a tank, but playing him as a tank is the only way to live.\n\nFor a while, we were able to use ZZrot to become SplitPush Singed, it was actually a good moment because Singed didn&rsquo;t die as much since ZZ&rsquo;rot could help us push without overextending. We would build ZZRot, RG, and Ruby Sightstone to avoid being caught. It was decent, and then ZZROT got changed and we could no longer do that.\n\nThe most current way to find any success with Singed is to build him like a support, part of the reason is that this season is so hard to get gold by farming or kills as Singed. Support Singed relies on your team by building RG, Ardent cleanser, and Redemption in conjunction with Stonebourne pact as your mastery. \n\nTo be frank, tank and support Singed  lack on any meaningful impact. \nBefore I quit Singed I started building Ludens, ZZROT, and quicksilver sash, and Deadmans plate. The idea is that it doesn&rsquo;t matter if you build AP or Tanky or Support &ndash; if they slow you even once, you are basically dead eitherway.  So Singed players might as well build to avoid any contact with other champions..  \n\nWhat I am trying to say is, us Singed mains were able to adapt with different items in the past. But this season, we just can&rsquo;t anymore &ndash; so that&rsquo;s why many of us just gave up. Items like adaptive help are the final nail in the coffin againt Singed. \n\nThe old talent trees &ndash; which believe it or not, actually worked on Singed better than the ones we have now.  Previously, you could get access to tenacity, to things that gave you a little more damage, and a little more tankiness. Which is great for hybrid champions like Singed. However, with the introduction of the new masteries. You have to make a choice between doing damage with Deathfire touch, or being able to access the much needed tenacity of the resolve tree. This hurts Singed a lot more than you think. \n\n\nMajor Problems\n\nMatchups\n\nNow at this point I would like to actually address the main problems that Singed has. I don&rsquo;t intend on going onto any specific matchups as the list would simply go on and on. I would say this about matchups though, it is clear to me that ranged matchups are intended to be a weakness for Singed, that I can understand. Singed is supposed to counter melee &ndash; but the only melee I can actually counter for the early game are Tryndamere or Jax &ndash; which eventually outscale me. I do not believe that there is another champion with as mana bad matchups as Singed. In any matchup, I feel like I did pretty well if I can get at least 50 cs in the first 10 minutes of the game. That is a really low bar, but that is where Singed stands now. \n\nEarlygame\n\nSpeaking of early game, Singed used to be able to use proxy to circumvent many of these bad matchups. But actually there was another hidden nerf that hurt Singed. Two actually. Proxy Singed was hurt when the removal of the bounty for killing a champion that has died too many times was removed. That essentially was the end of proxy Singed for most people. Some of us kept trying to do it &ndash; but often than not it simply made the opposite team snowball much faster. \n\nAnother thing that hurt Singed was the re-pathing of minions &ndash; before Singed used to be able to kite minions into the jungle to avoid taking so much damage. But that isn&rsquo;t the case anymore. This makes proxying a very dangerous and not so rewarding tactic.\n\nAnother problem with Singed&rsquo;s early game is that since so many matchups are so difficult &ndash; as is getting any CS. We have had to rely on building three or four Dark seals and a corruption potion. Please think about that for a second. Singed players have to build 3+ seals and corruption potion only to survive the laning phase while other players are almost completing their first item. This is not healthy gameplay &ndash; yet it is the only thing, the only thing that has helped Singed players survive laning. Singed has to constantly back and walk back to lane &ndash; while most champions up top can simply stay in lane past six with only a doran&rsquo;s blade.\n\nMidgame\n\nMidgame is the time where Singed becomes useful, but that is only if you managed to survive laning and were able to somehow make enough gold for RG. Reaching six means we can stay in lane longer to farm, and ULT is a powerful ability but I find myself mostly using it to push waves and reduce the damage taken while I push the waves or to regain mana and HP. But here is the kicker, Singed has to be very far ahead in the midgame to have any impact in the midgame. Sure having the Ult feels great, but you still have to walk up to people to do anything. Leaving his midgame feeling not powerful at all. \n\nLategame\n\nI wish I could say that Singed scales well into the late game but the fact to the matter is that he doesn&rsquo;t. Midgame is his strongest, and even then it is not really that strong since you usually have a very hard early game, with no gold or items to build anything useful. His late game is basically non-existent. In teamfights the only thing you can do is fling someone and then nothing. \n\nI recall a moment when one Riot member said that all Singed has to do is build RG, Deadmans plate, ZZ&rsquo;rot and use ghost to catch someone. What champion has to build those many items simply to feel useful? Most of my games are decided before the second item is even done. And with Singed, it is a challenge building even one item most of the time.\nPeople should be afraid of letting a champion like Singed get on them, but he does no damage. You literally do nothing in a team fight &ndash; often times I think of myself as an HP reservoir that the enemy ADC can just lifesteal off of me. It is so not fun. \n\nChampions\n\nNow let me say this, Riot Scarizard once said in a video that Singed and Rumble were the hardest champions in the game. Then&hellip;shouldn&rsquo;t it feel rewarding to make it to late game with such difficult champions? Shouldn&rsquo;t Singed have some sort of scaling that will make him feel more impactful in a teamfight? Shouldn&rsquo;t people be afraid to stand in Singed&rsquo;s gas or face some consequence for allowing Singed to farm up? I hate to bring up champions for example but let&rsquo;s look at Nasus &ndash; one of the weaker early game champs who scales tremendously and unlike Singed can farm safely at his tower and from a distance using spirit fire. Singed needs some scaling, for a champion that requires so much experience and practice &ndash; it should feel rewarding to play Singed up until late game.  Why, why should we continue playing a champion that takes twice the effort of other champions and half the fun? \n\nELO\n\nNow don&rsquo;t get me wrong &ndash; I know Singed is very effective in bronze and silver, but that begins to disappear once you get to gold. Players in gold know to how to kite Singed. And really that is all it takes sometimes to beat Singed in lane, simply walk backwards. Please take into consideration ELO when decided the state of Singed based on his data. \nLack of items you want\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the items that Singed used to want to build no longer reflect his kit. Most of the items he used to want had mana &ndash; and hence his passive was useful. But that is no longer the case, the only item with Mana anyone builds now is RG &ndash; but if you build it first, you simply do no damage.  This is one of the reasons that Singed mains complain so much &ndash; I believe if there were a greater variety of items that incuded mana and stats or utility that Singed actually wants, it would make playing Singed less painful. \n\n        AP Problems\n\n You could build Tear and Roa, but any Singed main knows that this is a terrible idea. Let&rsquo;s ignore the basic problems such as cost and time required to stack them, or the fact that Singed has a hard time farming to even be able to buy one of these items in the current state of the game. If Singed builds mana and AP &ndash; he will have no way to get into a fight or to engage and if he manages to get into a fight, he will die. Singed isn&rsquo;t a real tank &ndash; but if you try building him as the AP disruptor that he is meant to be, you will just die. You will be kited, slowed, and CC&rsquo;ed before you get can behind anyone to deal damage with your poison.\n\nIt is also worth mentioning that if you build mana and AP  - you will do less damage as the game goas on, since people eventually buy resistances. As Singed, you don&rsquo;t have the luxury of buying AP, tank items, AND magic penetration.  \nBuilding Hybrid Problems\n\nTo circumvent the problem of dying immediate as AP, most Singed players adopted a hybrid method build that included Rylais, Liandris, and then full tank. While that may have worked in season 6, it is noticeable that the damage is simply too high in season 7 and you will die also. In any case, champions simply heal through your damage through autoattacks. Singed is suppose to counter melee champions, yet melee champions will simply out heal your poison and kill you quickly if you don&rsquo;t have any tank items. \n\n       Building tanky problems\n\nA lot of people resorted to playing as a tank &ndash; however as a tank you have very minimal impact on the game as you are not a real tank. Real tanks can build tanky items and somehow, they can still do a lot more damage than you can. Additionally, you can&rsquo;t even clear waves decently if you build full tank. In teamfights, you are simply ignored after the fling &ndash; if you can get a fling. Singed has extremely long cooldowns and his damage scales with AP. Compare this with a champion like Poppy who merely builds tank and can still get on an enemy carry continuously and kill them. Or a fighter like Irelia who only needs to build Trinity force and full tank &ndash; that is enough to destroy a carry. As Singed you build tank and you can&rsquo;t even kill a minion, you have extremely long cool downs, and you basically just run around doing nothing after you fling, if you manage to fling. \n\nShouldn&rsquo;t people be afraid of a Singed getting on top of them? Instead, if I fling an enemy, often times they simply just turn around and kill me instead. Singed is a slow walking target practice and an HP reservoir for the enemy ADC. \n\n\n      Disruptor Problems\n\nSinged is meant to be a disruptor, but as I mentioned earlier. If Singed doesn&rsquo;t build full tank, he will simply die. Additionally, since so many champions are getting class updates, since Singed is considered a special playstyle, does this mean that he will never ever receive an update? The tank update was our only hope to receive some sort of beneficial change or items to help us do Singed things, instead &ndash; we got countered by Adaptive Helm.\n\n\n\n\n\n       Split Pushing\t\n\nThe problem has never been that Singed cannot catch people anymore&ndash; the problem is that everyone can catch Singed so easily. He just cannot get away. People are not afraid of chasing Singed or being on Singed since Singed just doesn&rsquo;t do any damage even if you build damage. While other champions get things like percentage movement speed, he has to rely on the same flat movement speed.\nAs Singed, if you build AP and mana, you have no utility to help you position in a fight.  If you build tanky, you can&rsquo;t push waves, you have no pressure, and you don&rsquo;t do anything in a fight. Hybrid doesn&rsquo;t work because you will be too squishy.\n\n\nChampion Ability Problems\n\nAs I mentioned before , I don&rsquo;t want Singed to get an entirely new kit or full rework. Let&rsquo;s not risk Singed becoming worse than he is now as with other reworks. Some Singed mains may want a full VGU but I am personally afraid of that. Instead, I suggest merely tinkering with his kit slightly. \n\nPassive \n\nThe point to the matter is that his passive is outdated. There is only one item Singed wants to buy that has Mana and that is Righteous Glory.  Currently there is no incentive to buy mana. I love the idea of Singed with Mana as a resource, but there is no incentive to use mana runes or build mana for any reason. Ryze wants mana, his abilities scale with both mana and AP. Is there any hope to allow for a similar mechanic that doesn&rsquo;t punish Singed players for building mana?\nSome champions have the equivalent of 2 or 3 passives but this passive is outdated. It is something all Singed mains agree on.  And the only thing I would change entirely about Singed.\n\n\tPoison trail\n\nPoison Gas trail is his signature move and personally I wouldn&rsquo;t touch it. I would love if it had scaling damage based on your AP and health though, so that if you built tank &ndash; you could actually bring some damage to a teamfight and be more impactful.\n\nActually one change that I would love would be poison gas trail dealing extra damage to minions. This would make building tank much less painful to clear a wave, even if it didn&rsquo;t do more damage to champions. \nOr what if the damage on Singed&rsquo;s poison trail increased the longer an enemy stood in the gas, similar to the mastery Battle Trance &ndash; this would punish players who continuously stand in Singed&rsquo;s poison trail without suffering any consequence. This would be useful since a Singed with AP, Magic Pen, and some armor items is a dead Singed. \n\n\tMega Adhesive\n\nI think it is a great item, but unfortunately has an extremely high mana cost. I don&rsquo;t mind the cost, and it is a great  ability but if I could change only one thing about Singed that wasn&rsquo;t his passive, it would be the ability to  cast this will moving. I have mentioned before that it is extremely easy for Singed to be caught, oftentimes if I get chased, I find myself never using  Mega Adhesive because if I stop to cast it &ndash; they will catch up, slow me, and kill me. It is also common not to put any points into this ability until after level 8. \n\nThere is another suggesting I would have regarding this ability, what if it could be used to farm  - much like Nasus&rsquo;s spirit fire. I think the high mana costs warrant it. If Mega Adhesive had a small poison cloud floating above it, even if it only affects minions. \n\nFling \n\nFling is great, and I don&rsquo;t really see the need to change anything about it. The fact that it is his only ability that does percentage HP damage is really nice. I wish more of his abilities were.\nInsanity Potion\n\nInsanity potion is also great as is, but it would be great if it had some sort of scaling added to it. Something like 3% Mana as HP5 when you Ult?  I know many Singed mains would like to see tenacity come back &ndash; but I realize that it is also part of his weakness. However, I want to remind the designers that Singed comes from a time where CC and mobility were scarce. Nowadays, ever champion seems to have some CC or ability to escape easily.  Might I suggest adding slow resist instead? Or adding a little slow resist each time Singed puts a point in R? \n\nI am not a designer and I know Riot could do without the suggestions, it is just to highlight that Singed could be updated with small quality of life changes without destroying him. I know he holds a special place in your designer heart, but that shouldn&rsquo;t stop you from improving him. \n\nPlease take these words into consideration and I am sorry this letter is much longer than expected. I would like to believe that you took the time to read some of this letter. \nI won&rsquo;t be playing Singed anymore &ndash; I don&rsquo;t say this as an ultimatum of any sort. The champion is simply not fun right now. There are no &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t chase the Singed moments.&rdquo; Singed has no impact. There are no items that correlate with his kit. And everyone simply out damages and outruns poor Singed. But I will be back, someday I hope. \nAnyways, thank you for taking the time to read this &ndash; if you read this.","replies":[{"poster":"MANWOLFAXEBOSS","date":"2017-05-08T21:51:16.561+0000","up_votes":35,"down_votes":2,"body":"Thanks for taking the time to write this up. I know you’re super passionate about Singed and I appreciate the thoughtful post.\n\nWhy Buff Singed\nYou’re right in that the majority of people playing Singed are Singed mains. This has been true for nearly all of LoL’s life. Even when he’s been very strong, he’s not a champion that appeals to many, whether due to playstyle or persona (almost certainly both). His mastery path is rather obtuse and skews heavily towards strategy rather than tactics. \n\nSo we’re left with a bunch of Singed mains with hundreds of games played on Singed only. As with many similar champions, this leads to a low average win rate and high experienced player win rate. This is true of every champion to some degree, but Singed sits on the extreme end of things. Then who do we balance for? Do we balance for the first time player or the 1000th time player? Well, there’s no clean answer unfortunately and it usually gets taken on a case by case basis. For Singed, it’s the experienced player case (Side note, champion.gg data is average win rate). Reason being, as mentioned above, even when Singed is statistically OP he doesn’t draw players. Wouldn’t that make him a good candidate for a visual/gameplay update? Perhaps, but that’s the Champ-Update team and I can’t speak confidently to their prioritization. Sorry for lack of clarity there. I’ll try and grab someone today and see if they can respond here.\n\nSinged History\nI wasn’t on the balance team at the time, but I pushed back quite hard on the removal of tenacity from R. I would have liked to see defensive stats removed instead. My reasoning was that I never want to stop running as Singed. If I need to die, fine, but let me die running. Felt like we were removing more fun than power. That said, I also understand why we removed it. Singed being able to “freely” access the backline was not meant for his power profile. That was the riddle for Singed players to solve, not the inverse where backline has to figure out how to avoid him.\n\nMatchups\nFor lane matchups, I agree with most of your assessments. Singed doesn’t have many winning ones and some of his previous ones have been removed. He used to be able to bypass this with proxy farming, but that isn’t as viable as it used to be (for good reason). 3x Dark Seal in laning phase was fun initially because it felt like gaming the system, but now it’s more like you’re forced to just to survive. Singed has a decent level 2 all-in with Ignite, but for the most part his early game is weak. This isn’t bad if it’s made up for elsewhere. We’ll get into that.\n\nMidgame\nDisagree with your midgame assessment. Assuming you aren’t woefully behind, Singed’s midgame is quite powerful.\n\nLategame\nI think what you’re objecting to is Singed’s current best/most reliable build being driven by deficits. Singed is forced to buy items that shore up his weaknesses rather than enhance his strengths. Rylai’s + Liandry’s (RoA) are natural fits for Singed, but suboptimal due to current state of LoL. This ends up feeling lame as most people weren’t drawn to Singed to be a pick champ. Exacerbated by the fact that Singed doesn’t have a clean classification in LoL. We can’t say he’s failing/succeeding at X because we don’t have a well defined X. He, like Blitzcrank for example, falls into a special category of “they’re weird.” If Singed’s best build were TF > Gunblade, would he be failing? Either way, if you have to build tank to function then you should be tuned accordingly.\n\nTl;dr - I agree that even though Singed’s win rate may be fine, his current best build option isn’t compelling. It’s not why most Singed players want to play Singed\n\nChampions\n“Difficult to learn” doesn’t mean “has a strong late game.” You can have an early game power house with a steep learning curve. That said, because his current early game is so weak he should probably scale better late.\n\nElo\nI’ve said it before, but Singed’s win rate at all ELOs is healthy. Again, we balance Singed with experienced players in mind. You’re right that his win rate at lower rankings is better, but even at the highest MMR he is over 50%.\n\nItems\nDiscussed this in Lategame section. For his passive, we agree. When Singed receives a significant update, this is likely the first place we look.\n\nDisruptor Problems\nI disagree about Singed damage output being too low when building AP. That said, it harkens back to the problem of Singed having to build tank. \n\nAdaptive Helm helps Singed too and the number of champions that get to rush this against him is relatively low. Don’t think this is a problem. On that note, early internal data shows Singed’s win rate going up on patch 7.9.\n\nSplit Pushing\nAssuming you’re talking about a tank build, so yes. Singed doesn’t get to build Sunfire or Titanic like many other tanks and he scales based on the assumption that he’ll have an AP item or two. Even so, his clear speed is reasonable. \n\nAbilities\nGood suggestions here. Agree that some small scope stuff could go a long way. The problem is that with many of these seemingly easy suggestions, they can’t just be done in a vacuum. We can’t responsible just buff Singed. All of these suggestions are zero-sum, requiring taking power from other parts of the kit, validation, etc. When you look at the value proposition of working on “on fire” champions vs. someone doing relatively well, it’s a tough sell. However, the satisfaction angle is pretty compelling to me... \n\nAnyway, again I really appreciate you taking the time to write this. I wish I could say, “Awesome! We’ll make Singed our top priority and fix all these problems next patch!” I can’t do that. What I can do though, is make sure this sentiment is understood on both Live Gameplay (the balance team) and Champion-Update. Hopefully, we can get some work slated soon.","replies":[{"poster":"Hammermancer","date":"2017-05-09T00:34:31.248+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"As one of the few guys who loved pizza feet taric and old yorick, i'd like to thank you for understanding that reworks definitely leave some of us alienated.\n\n\n\nCould it be reasonable to say that singed is actually a champion who sheds light on something that could be expanded upon? proxy farm champions that is.

Gotcha. \n\nHave you ever stopped to think singed players enjoy playing singed not only because _it was \"exciting\" and a different challenge to proxy farm, but because we love the run?_ Every game with every other champ, you're always in lane. Farm, fight, farm, fight. If you're playing juggernauts or fighters/duelists (and who isn't, this season), it's always \"fight engage fight engage. ganks!\"\n\nWith singed proxy farming, you get a different style of laning; I would even go so far as to say \"relaxing\" (it was to me at least). Then sometimes comes the chase, the thrill and rush of being able to outwit and outsmart two or three opponents, laughing maniacally all the while knowing that you're #wastingtheirtime.\n\nNow, we can't even do that effectively anymore. Pigeon-holed back into meta-enforced laning phases, where practically _every matchup is a losing matchup_. Yay. How droll and monotonous.\n\nHell, I can beat singed **only using Soraka, zzrot, and banner of command**, and always out pressure him for first turret.\n\n\n#Riot enforcing meta, confirmed here.\n\n> Adaptive Helm helps Singed too and the number of champions that get to rush this against him is relatively low. \n\nAgain, forcing singed into a \"tank role\" when he is not a tank. He is not fun to play as a tank. He feels horrible when you have to build tank items just to survive the lane.\n\nAlso, Adaptive Helm is very cost-efficient and can easily be rushed as a second or even first item by many juggernauts and fighters top lane.\n\nIf I were playing vs a singed in today's patch (note: I've played on average 5 to 10 games _per day_ on this patch so far, and I have not seen a singed player **even once**), I could pick something like {{champion:122}} {{champion:75}} {{champion:266}} {{champion:36}} {{champion:86}} etc, rush adaptive helm, _and still do enough damage to either stop singed in his tracks, or outpush him with zzrot and adaptive helm_.\n\n> Either way, if you have to build tank to function then you should be tuned accordingly.\n\nCorrect me if I'm wrong, but is this implying that because singed players need to build tank to function, that singed should then be balanced _as a tank_....? Because if so, that's really fucked up.\n\nChampions should be brought up to the current game's state of play with updates to their core identity; not rehashed and re-classed _because of_ the changes over the season to the game.\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"MANWOLFAXEBOSS","date":"2017-05-09T17:24:49.997+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"As mentioned above, I love/d proxy farming on Singed, but 9 other people in the game don't.

Let me explain.\n\n*****\n\n**One: **as with _any other multiplayer / team-based online video game since the inception of the internet_ (and yes, I was around for that; I'm 32 years old), while the needs and desires of the community are usually always taken into account as the majority (and the primary source of a company's income \"overall\"), it is **exceedingly imperative** also that the needs and desires of the _individual consumer and smaller \"cliques\" within the community_ be taken into account as well.\n\nWhat I mean by that is, Riot should always strive to do what's best for the community / game as a whole of course, but not throw the individual player's or smaller communities' needs and wants under the bus, either. There has to be a balance of both. \n\n*****\n\n**Two: **In reference to proxy singed specifically; while at the onset of league's development years ago, proxy singed was developed by player(s) in order to maximize that champion's strengths specifically, _due to the inherent design of singed as a champion_. That is, **you guys created singed the way he is, as a _disrupter_ that needs to reach the backline, with only one tool in the way of farming/waveclearing**.\n\nYou made the champion this way, for whatever reason, and now have a large dedicated community of singed players that adhere to the singed \"lifestyle\" and way of playing. **Proxy farming has been one of those methods of playing that efficiently assist singed players maximize gold income in order to win games**. By removing this capability, you have _further gimped singed in addition to the aforementioned \"stealth nerfs\" to singed's gameplay_. So either make him stronger in lane, or completely rework the champion.\n\nHowever, realize that you are effectively slicing off a portion of your consumer base with singed players that _enjoy proxy farming and the unique challenges that style of laning presents_. \n\n*****\n\n**Three: **Again, as I said above, **players are not here to maximize/create/sustain other players' enjoyment of the game, each player must find enjoyment in the game within their own gameplay**. I will _not be held responsible for making my LANE OPPONENT 'happy' -- my purpose is to WIN games not ENTERTAIN others and CRADLE their emotional well-being_.\n\nThe fact of the matter is, your version of \"making the game enjoyable for everyone\" means \"forcing everyone to conform to a pre-determined standard of gameplay\" -- i.e. **the meta-game** as set forth by Riot games.\n\nWhy should _one subset_ of the community be penalized for creatively seeking ways to efficiently win games with their selected champion?\n\nWhy should the modification of one champion's original design flaws by the community and evolution of that champion's playstyle be erased, simply because of lack of attention from the designers over the course of the years -- while the rest of the game evolved in an overwhelmingly hostile place for said champion?\n\nNot everyone hates proxy singed. Not everyone loves proxy singed. Hate it or love it, proxy singed _is one of the primary methods of achieving victory for singed_. In fact, **proxy farming itself is a viable method of 'laning', were there more champions capable of doing so as easily as singed**.\n\nBy saying \"proxy singed\" is \"bad for the enjoyment of the game\", you are saying \"proxy farming is bad for the enjoyment of the game\", and by saying THAT, **you are essentially saying the only 'proper method' for playing league is by farming in the lane with your opponent for the duration of the laning phase, and all other methods that do not involve directly confronting your opponent in lane will be forcibly erased/nerfed from the game**\n\nAgain, _this is enforcing a specific style of game-play aka META GAME_.\n\n*****\n\n**Four (because I'm a jhin main)**\nWhich brings me back to my original point; where is the line drawn between \"keeping 10 players in a game happy and enjoying the game\", versus \"allowing the individual player to express their own creative game-play and enjoyment\"?\n\nI've played since season 3 myself, and I have seen the game evolve over time due to Riot's design and game philosophies; your company and staff constantly claim to **embrace 'off-meta' / creative game-play**, but your constant re-imagining of champions and the game structure itself actually eschew off-meta play-styles. For example, **your company has a tendency to pigeon-hole champions  by nerfing/gutting/reworking them _back into only one viable modality of play-style_, after the community finds alternative build paths or ways to maximize that champion's strengths and shore up their weaknesses_. \n\nYou claim that you are simply making sure _\"everyone can enjoy the game\"_, yet you are woefully misrepresenting/misunderstanding what \"everyone\" means. It does not mean **the majority over the minority**, because that is not fair and balanced to the player-base as a whole. It might be \"financially sound\" to always side with outcry from a large group of players, but that is not morally just or fair to the other group of players that find enjoyment by theorycrafting and developing creative, unique, off-meta builds and play-styles. \n\n**You set a standard of how League is played; there are lanes, there are minion waves that must be 'farmed', there are 5 players on each side of the map opposing each other. Now you are essentially saying that the _only correct way for those players to interact with each other and the 'farm' itself, is by direct confrontation with each other at all stages of the game, within those pre-defined lanes._**\n\n##That is the very definition of \"enforcing the meta\".\n\n**Summary and final point**\nSinged players found a way around that _specifically for their champion_; is it fun for ALL players in EVERY single match? Of course not. It's _definitely_ not going to be \"fun\" for the OPPOSING team -- but how can you sit here and argue a case that says _each team's \"game happiness factor\" HAS TO BE SATISFIED BY THE OPPOSING SIDE?_ That is simply illogical and ridiculous. **Confrontation is not meant to be \"enjoyable\" for the ones on the losing end; it is meant to stop opponents in any way necessary to achieve victory for yourself and your team**.\n\nIf you truly want both teams to \"always enjoy the game\", then you should have created League to have stalemates/draws at the end, that way no one loses and everyone is happy.\n\nEither that, or never create champions like singed ever again -- and make sure _all existing and future champions' kits never allow them to be \"modified\" or stray from the predefined style of game-play as set forth by the community or Riot.\n\n#You cannot claim to embrace creativity and uniqueness of your players, and at the same time limit or remove the ways those players are able to express that creativity and uniqueness by limiting or removing existing champion capabilities and mechanics.\n\n*****\n\nI hope I've made my stance as clear as possible, and if you have any questions or rebuttals, I am more than willing to clarify and/or debate with you on Riot's \"game philosophy\".","replies":[{"poster":"MANWOLFAXEBOSS","date":"2017-05-09T23:57:15.021+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see what you're getting at.

I started maining singed because i was getting singed proxy top laners just dominating his side of the map.  I think most players  were more than happy to get an experienced singed in their squad. It was painful for the other team and not at all \"engaging gameplay\" for the top laner, but neither is getting singed vs quinn, kennen, nasus, fiora, vladimir, swain, kayle, gnar, jayce, or yorick. Since the proxy strategy was removed we have nothing to deal with these champions. If my team doesn't get 10 bans and all coordinate them together so i can play singed, then i don't feel comfortable blind picking him. It's mostly a gamble of banning fiora and praying the rest don't pop up or i'm forced to dodge or risk getting reported for inting.\n\n    I have 0 fun laning against an orianna, zed, katarina, caitlin, janna, soraka, vladimir, fiora, lulu, zyra, ryze, leblanc, and xeyah in general. These are just off the top of my head.  They don't bring really engaging play styles unless were going to use riots definition of \"engaging play styles\" which i still don't know. Apparently camilles ult in engaging but not for the person on the receiving end. Just because i'm forced to engage doesn't mean it is \"engaging.\"  In lane phase half of the time she uses it to block an escape to finish off the kill and the player just stands still and waits for death.   It would be nice if you were more transparent about this idea of engaging playstyles or having everyone enjoy the mechanics you implement. It's really hard for me to understand that you want all 10 players to enjoy the game and update caitlin/janna lane to be the furthest thing from fun for the other bot lane. \n\n  Proxy singed was a staple to the champion. He was balanced with it in mind for years and then slowly restricted without compensating for the losses. His build path was hit in the same way. Riot even acknowledged bruiser singed is gone by updating his item set but left him with the passive that was somewhat reliant on the ROA.  Now with my current build i'm looking at my passive giving me 75 health from RG and some from base mana. It is useless. \n\n   With this patch he got hit again with getting less health on every item so my ultimate has less health to protect with the bonus resistances. He is forgotten about with every update. The worst this year have been rylais slow, followed by BORK making sure that every adc rushes it and is able to kite me during my strongest point in the game, and finally banshees on mid laners. So now i have to pray they have a squishy jungler i can try and catch because most adcs and every mid now have a way of dealing with me. My adhesive cannot proc the banshees so as long as they stand behind sejuani or maokai i cannot engage.  Trying to splitpush against a poppy who bought adaptive helm is a joke. I set down my nerfed zzrot right in front of her because the range on it requires me 2. She walks right into a massive wave of minions and me and starts attacking the rot. I fling her into adhesive because she is ignoring me but it doesn't matter. She just casually waits out the duration and walks back over to the rot to kill it because i am doing no damage. She can tank me for literally minutes but she can kill me fast as shit with her low cooldown %health damage. I really am confused this patch on what i am supposed to do. If i don't get 10 kills before 15 minutes i honestly feel like i am nothing more than a health pool that can push waves as long as no one else is in lane with me. \n\n   I know riot makes you take a class or something before being able to post on reddit/boards but you guys really need to be on the same page. Everything is contradictory if you compare it to singed. I cannot understand how you can say 9 players in the game hate proxy singed but then release vladimir a year ago and feel confident it is in line with your philosophy of the game.  I understand the main goal of any company is to make money but this is ridiculous. Singed doesn't make money so just ignore him and say the \"the numbers we can't show you says he is fine.\" He isn't fine. You know he isn't fine. \n\n I also disagree with the comment you said about elo. I'm currently sitting at like rank 70 on the best singed NA page and i'm platinum 4. That means no one is playing him in high elo. You said yourself the majority of singed players are singed mains but there are only 70  people on the continent playing him consistently in high elo. That doesn't seem like a very big pool to draw numbers from and shouldn't be taken as accurate statistics. I find it easier to climb this season with champions i rarely play just because i have so many more tools to impact the game. Soraka right now is more rewarding to play than singed IMO.\n\n  I don't think he needs a new kit. I think he needs a passive and the adhesive needs to be able to proc banshees. Just small changes to both would do an enormous amount to the champion. I love singed. I'm just at the point where i don't think i can play him anymore","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Xavanic","date":"2017-05-09T17:18:59.467+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well proxy farming is unfun as it basically screws over any laner that lacks sustain to tank the minion waves or the mobility to keep up with the champ that is proxy farming, singed does need to be stronger, but proxy farming 24/7 isn't fun nor heathly for the game, especially with his kit design\nEDIT: Also with riots changes as of late, alot of champs that function as a tank are losing effectiveness in the other possiblites (ap nasus/malphite are worthless with all the mr now, ad garen dies to fast and cant keep up after his nerfs, ad kled has been nerfed hard with the nerfs to BC and LW) expect them make singed function as a tank with a very useless off meta ap build","replies":[{"poster":"Chønklord","date":"2017-05-09T21:54:01.058+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"> Well proxy farming is unfun as it basically screws over any laner that lacks sustain to tank the minion waves or the mobility to keep up with the champ that is proxy farming\n\nIt's not **my responsibility** to make my **oppononent's game _FUN_**; it's to beat them to a pulp and win the game for myself and my team.\n\n#I'm not here for other people's enjoyment/satisfaction\n\nThey are free to enjoy the game for themselves how they see fit; that's the whole point of picking the champ you want to play and how you want to play them, within the confines of 5v5 team-oriented gameplay.\n\nIs winning _unfun_?

Also walking into lane with minions has always been a counter to proxying however good the proxy was, if there is a champion in the minion wave you cant really proxy(at least in the first levels) So there is already by definition introduced a tempogame of keeping singed from proxying by denying exp etc, it might not be pressing your q button and getting instant dopamine feedback because you see singeds health bar go lower in lane, but it is still interactive and strategical. My overall point is that seeing the current champion releases and updates(talon running around with maphacks, camille, galio etc) I have gotten the feeling that most of the people designing the champions are way too focused on the instant dopamine feedback they get when they see a champion hit an ability(which makes sense, easy access satisfaction is marketable) that they are kind of unknowingly/(or as the comment I was responding to inferred) knowingly removing strategic depth from the game in favor of satisfying the adhd of the majority of people playing the game.\n\n*edit not to suggest literal mental disorders, just to point out that the decision seems to be made in the way most of todays multimedia applications are designed.

This has been true for nearly all of LoL’s life. Even when he’s been very strong, he’s not a champion that appeals to many, whether due to playstyle or persona (almost certainly both). His mastery path is rather obtuse and skews heavily towards strategy rather than tactics. \n> \n> So we’re left with a bunch of Singed mains with hundreds of games played on Singed only. As with many similar champions, this leads to a low average win rate and high experienced player win rate. This is true of every champion to some degree, but Singed sits on the extreme end of things. Then who do we balance for? Do we balance for the first time player or the 1000th time player? Well, there’s no clean answer unfortunately and it usually gets taken on a case by case basis. For Singed, it’s the experienced player case (Side note, champion.gg data is average win rate). Reason being, as mentioned above, even when Singed is statistically OP he doesn’t draw players. Wouldn’t that make him a good candidate for a visual/gameplay update? Perhaps, but that’s the Champ-Update team and I can’t speak confidently to their prioritization. Sorry for lack of clarity there. I’ll try and grab someone today and see if they can respond here.\n> \n> Singed History\n> I wasn’t on the balance team at the time, but I pushed back quite hard on the removal of tenacity from R. I would have liked to see defensive stats removed instead. My reasoning was that I never want to stop running as Singed. If I need to die, fine, but let me die running. Felt like we were removing more fun than power. That said, I also understand why we removed it. Singed being able to “freely” access the backline was not meant for his power profile. That was the riddle for Singed players to solve, not the inverse where backline has to figure out how to avoid him.\n> \n> Matchups\n> For lane matchups, I agree with most of your assessments. Singed doesn’t have many winning ones and some of his previous ones have been removed. He used to be able to bypass this with proxy farming, but that isn’t as viable as it used to be (for good reason). 3x Dark Seal in laning phase was fun initially because it felt like gaming the system, but now it’s more like you’re forced to just to survive. Singed has a decent level 2 all-in with Ignite, but for the most part his early game is weak. This isn’t bad if it’s made up for elsewhere. We’ll get into that.\n> \n> Midgame\n> Disagree with your midgame assessment. Assuming you aren’t woefully behind, Singed’s midgame is quite powerful.\n> \n> Lategame\n> I think what you’re objecting to is Singed’s current best/most reliable build being driven by deficits. Singed is forced to buy items that shore up his weaknesses rather than enhance his strengths. Rylai’s + Liandry’s (RoA) are natural fits for Singed, but suboptimal due to current state of LoL. This ends up feeling lame as most people weren’t drawn to Singed to be a pick champ. Exacerbated by the fact that Singed doesn’t have a clean classification in LoL. We can’t say he’s failing/succeeding at X because we don’t have a well defined X. He, like Blitzcrank for example, falls into a special category of “they’re weird.” If Singed’s best build were TF &gt; Gunblade, would he be failing? Either way, if you have to build tank to function then you should be tuned accordingly.\n> \n> Tl;dr - I agree that even though Singed’s win rate may be fine, his current best build option isn’t compelling. It’s not why most Singed players want to play Singed\n> \n> Champions\n> “Difficult to learn” doesn’t mean “has a strong late game.” You can have an early game power house with a steep learning curve. That said, because his current early game is so weak he should probably scale better late.\n> \n> Elo\n> I’ve said it before, but Singed’s win rate at all ELOs is healthy. Again, we balance Singed with experienced players in mind. You’re right that his win rate at lower rankings is better, but even at the highest MMR he is over 50%.\n> \n> Items\n> Discussed this in Lategame section. For his passive, we agree. When Singed receives a significant update, this is likely the first place we look.\n> \n> Disruptor Problems\n> I disagree about Singed damage output being too low when building AP. That said, it harkens back to the problem of Singed having to build tank. \n> \n> Adaptive Helm helps Singed too and the number of champions that get to rush this against him is relatively low. Don’t think this is a problem. On that note, early internal data shows Singed’s win rate going up on patch 7.9.\n> \n> Split Pushing\n> Assuming you’re talking about a tank build, so yes. Singed doesn’t get to build Sunfire or Titanic like many other tanks and he scales based on the assumption that he’ll have an AP item or two. Even so, his clear speed is reasonable. \n> \n> Abilities\n> Good suggestions here. Agree that some small scope stuff could go a long way. The problem is that with many of these seemingly easy suggestions, they can’t just be done in a vacuum. We can’t responsible just buff Singed. All of these suggestions are zero-sum, requiring taking power from other parts of the kit, validation, etc. When you look at the value proposition of working on “on fire” champions vs. someone doing relatively well, it’s a tough sell. However, the satisfaction angle is pretty compelling to me... \n> \n> Anyway, again I really appreciate you taking the time to write this. I wish I could say, “Awesome! We’ll make Singed our top priority and fix all these problems next patch!” I can’t do that. What I can do though, is make sure this sentiment is understood on both Live Gameplay (the balance team) and Champion-Update. Hopefully, we can get some work slated soon.\n\nI never seen a Rioter make a more beautiful well written but at the same time 100% correct and on point comment ever","replies":[{"poster":"Kujararanch","date":"2017-05-08T22:42:01.118+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is hope!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Anime9001","date":"2017-05-10T03:51:31.834+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really appreciate seeing the effort you've taken in reading and analyzing the OP's post, and I see that probably the biggest question you had after all of this is \"where can we take Singed's power away to buff him without overtuning him?\"  And I feel that there may be an interesting way of looking at this.\n\nProbably the part of your post that surprised me the most was that you said that you feel Singed should be tuned with his hardcore playerbase in mind over newcomers, as Singed is not a champion who has many players play who don't main him. In other words, Singed's current win percentage is a good indication of Singed's current power in the game and cannot be simply buffed. While I may not exactly agree with this way of balancing the champion, I can respect this viewpoint. But as I believe you both already stated, Singed is never a champion someone plays because they want to win the game. Now, here me out. The people who play Singed, the playerbase you say Singed is mainly tuned for, play Singed because they want to play Singed. Not because he is strong. And the current build Singed mains use is to optimally play the champion in his current state, *but no Singed main wants to play Singed like this, because it's not playing Singed anymore.*\n\nYou say that Singed can't be vertically buffed because this would tip his win percentage, but if playing Singed like Singed became a REASONABLE alternative, it sounds to me that the Singed playerbase would jump to that in a heartbeat over a slightly overtuned tank Singed build. Singed mains want to main Singed, not a tanky guy who can fling someone every 7 seconds. And since new players don't tend to drift towards Singed even when he's overtuned, you would only have a non-statistically viable (or possibly slightly more/less than that) number of people playing Singed in this way.\n\nI will say though that any Singed buffs going off of this logic should probably aim to incentivize Singed building damage, perhaps by making him less reliant on building full tank, and should probably avoid rewarding you for building full tank (like the OP's suggestion of giving Q health scaling). That's only if the balance team used this logic in balancing Singed however.\n\nNow, I understand that this may be a bit of a slanted viewpoint, so I'll give a few trade-off suggestions as well.\n\n1. If you were considering the tenacity for Singed's ult again, I would say trading off a few of his defensive numbers would be a simple way to go. \n\n2. Remove Singed's passive for a new one. Like, almost anything. Sure, any Singed main will tell you that his passive is worthless. But unless the balance team believes Singed's passive is LITERALLY useless (in which case, it's the same as admitting Singed basically doesn't have a passive), taking it away for a new one has to have some horizontal trade-off....\n\n3. The best suggestion I can think of however would be to lower Singed's base AD. Early in the game, Singed's autos do a surprising amount of damage due to his surprisingly high base ad. If you check every champion in the game, Singed literally has the 3rd highest lv 1 base ad in the game. Sure, this is what allows Singed to cs in the early game, and is also why his sky-auto-attack can be so good in early trades, but if it meant getting a buff to his gameplay somewhere where he needs it, I'd say this is one of the easiest places Singed can make a trade-off without making things significantly worse for him or losing a portion of his identity. Especially if the trade-off was for one of the suggestions that helped waveclear (even if it was for later in the game), such as the w doing damage/minion damage or gas being tweaked in a way to deal with minions easier. \n\n4. Lowering W's later rank slow %s or goo-fling %s in general (perferably the former). I'd particularly love taking the later rank slow % trade-off for the OP's suggestion of being able to cast it while moving. I personally never take W until level 8 because that split second it takes you to stop to drop it makes you lose any gain you were going to have out of it for anyone not standing right on top of you. That stationary casting time/animation makes it basically impossible to engage with your W, and risks killing you if you attempt to disengage with it. I'd suggest lowering its slow %s in general, but its early ranks are barely noticeable as a slow as it is. Until I'm nearing max rank in W (so basically lv 18), it's essentially just a last-ditch-escape goo-fling attempt when I have no other option but that or die. I'd prefer to stay away from goo-fling % nerfs as a trade-off, as they are really hard to nail and can get you out of tough situations, and that snare can be VERY helpful when it lands, but just like before goo-fling's existence, it wouldn't exactly hard Singed's identity or fun too much if it was nerfed for the sake of something else he needs. On that note, swapping the goo-fling's scaling from Singed's E to his W would actually be a major nerf to it, as no self-respecting Singed main ranks W before E. While I, once again, would prefer the goo-fling to not be nerfed, I think nerfing the scaling by swapping which skill makes it scale is another viable option.\n\nAs an aside, I would not suggest nerfing Singed's Q or E in any way. Especially Singed's laugh on E. That was the most powerful buff in the game.\n\nAnd with that, I hope this can help to some degree. I'm just a Gold Singed main, so I probably don't know a lot of what I'm talking about, but hopefully this post is not a complete waste of your time.
