Is there a &quot;reverse&quot; promotional or is it if I lose 1 game at 0LP I automatically drop to Silver 1. So the question is with the end of the season coming if I didnt play ranked for 11 days would I decay and auto lose my barely deserved Gold status for end of season rewards, and If I felt like playing a game of ranked is 1 loss going to hose that as well so stick to norms. Any clarity on how that whole thing works would be great.","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2015-11-07T01:13:46.570+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1. There is no decay for Gold and below. If you don't play, don't worry!\n\n2. It's harder to get demoted from a tier than it is a division.\n * You need much lower MMR than the division you're in before you'll get demoted from a tier when losing at 0 LP.\n * When you are promoted into a new division, you get 3 free games of demotion shielding. For a tier, it's 10.","replies":[{"poster":"tunehunter","date":"2015-11-07T01:33:31.758+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"oh cool so I can basically feel safe to both play norms mostly and if I feel like trying to climb I can feel safe in trying at least or 2 games with fair amount of safety and if i win and climb all the better :)","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2015-11-07T01:48:53.088+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yep. Also, once the season ends and we get rewards on the 11th, we can play Ranked without affecting the rewards we already got during preseason. Since it won't hurt your rewards, it's a good idea to use preseason to raise your MMR; with the new season we lose about 2 divisions worth of MMR in a \"soft reset\", so if you're at the bottom of a tier you might get placed into the tier below it next season.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"DingleNutsMcGee","date":"2015-11-07T01:23:07.141+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea exactly what this guy said ^","replies":[]}]}
