Ideally you wanna use it for peel (which you don't have very much of to begin with), but it can be used as a way of keeping yourself relatively healthy without opponents around. Also serves as a solution to mana regen.\n\n{{item:3083}} is a bit of an odd choice, because while it does increase your health costs by a lot, it also gives you a %max health regen. Quite a significant if you manage to not take any hits during an engagement, which depends on your skill at positioning and the enemy's decisions of whether or not to focus you.\nAs a long-term solution to keeping your health up, this is probably your best bet.\n\n{{item:3065}} can be a bit tricky to look at, because it's hard to identify whether the regen&passive will make up for the extra health. In conclusion, at lvl 18 with unupgraded sightstone it does. At lower levels it may or may not depending on stuff. the closer your health is to 2000, then the closer you are to the point where the payoff is enough. If you need magic resist and feel like being a bit beefier, and can use the CDR, then spirit visage is doable. Goes great with Warmog's.\n\nStrictly speaking, SA doesn't actually add any new sustain into her kit, but as an option which generally balances itself out in the end it's worth a mention.\n\nAlso remeber that building flat AP both increases her healing power on others (meaning she has to heal less often) and increases the self-healing proccs on her W (meaning she has to hit fewer Qs in order to heal up).\n\nSo where's the problem here really?\n\nIn essence, the problem with her playstyle, is that while at max CDR, your burst heal potential is incredible (especially when you use all of W+Ult+Summoner Heal in one go), her sustained healing bears the peril of no opponents being around, simply put, if your whole team is kinda low after a sucessful engagement that you may even have won, you do not offer the kind of second wind you might expect from the core healer of the game, unless you specc away from burst heals in favour of warmogs+spirit visage. \n\nThe lack of objectives like Dragon and Baron proccing her W passive heals makes her an especially weak asset in helping her team take objectives, as she risks being caught out if she heals her team while they're fighting the neutral objectives.\n\nHer kit just doesn't offer her any way to interact with her own health when she's low, except for a way which you may not take advantage of if your opponents are dead. Often I find myself wishing that my opponent had gone down slightly slower so I could've got of another Q on them, this shouldn't be happening, I shouldn't want to have my team delay kills so I can keep being active in the game.\n\nI find it fine that heals are limited some way, whether it be by high mana costs, low base and scaling or high cooldowns, or in this case, remaining % health.\n\nThe problem here is that her long term healing potential is limited by remaining opponents. So that if we ace them I'm working with maybe 5-6 heals until they get back, or until I back. Maybe more if i still have my ult/Summoner Heal/Mikael's Crucible.\n\nI keep saying (and have been saying pretty much since her rework) that Soraka needs another way of regaining health. An out of combat way of doing so, maybe a passive which lets her spend time standing still doing nothing but convert %max mana into %missing health, maybe something as simple as letting large jungle monsters procc her heals, or even letting it procc on minions for severely reduced amounts (like: any number of minions=1/2 champion).\n\nShe's *fine* currently, but she feels like she's missing that little something which'll let her keep going when now you'd just either sit around and do nothing because you're too low to heal anyone or go ward or something, or back because you're low after healing everyone.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Xonian","date":"2015-05-08T02:25:40.606+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you took Soraka's percent health cost away, and just kept the mana portion, there is literally no risk in playing her.
