Riot actually does want to lose some customers: ones like you, who ruin the game for everyone else. They would rather you didn't make anymore accounts, because you consistently bother other people.\n\n> I would like my Avinash88 account back or I will take legal action and I have enough evidence to take these steps.\n\nIt's not \"your\" account; it belongs to Riot. Everything you use and see and do in LoL belongs to Riot. The account, the skins, the RP, everything. They're just letting you use it. You should read the terms you're given before agreeing to them, which I would've expected from a lawyer. I don't know how it works to file a lawsuit in Europe against a company that operates in Europe but is headquartered in the U.S. and owned by a Chinese company, but if it's anything like the U.S. process, you are free to file any lawsuit you like. If it's ridiculous, though, it'll be thrown out almost immediately.\n\n> I am also going to demand a fee because I have not been able to play on this account.\n\nWhat fee? For what? You want Riot to pay you to not use their property? That doesn't make any sense at all.\n\n> I expect at least a message from riot and also my account back.\n\nYou could file a support ticket, but once they establish that your punishments were deserved, they'll close it. You could file additional tickets, but once they establish that they're repeated requests to do something they will never do for a banned player, they'll autoclose your tickets and you'll just get automated responses.","replies":[{"poster":"julliewetennix","date":"2019-04-27T21:30:56.100+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":11,"body":"thanks for your comment.\n\nBut if someone flames your mother, for example, you automatically say something negative and of course that's wrong.\n\nBut I'm just an honest player who enjoys the pots I play.\n\nBut there are really people in between who are trying to ruin the game for others by express.\n\nAnd it seems that riot doesn't do anything about that because I have had at least 20 trollers in the last 25 games.\n\nAnd the strange thing is that it always happened in my team\n\nsorry for my bad english because i'm a dutchman.","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-04-27T22:51:59.626+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=julliewetennix,realm=EUW,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=7i6HrAcX,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2019-04-27T21:30:56.100+0000)\n>\n> thanks for your comment.\n\nYou're welcome.\n\n> But if someone flames your mother, for example, you automatically say something negative and of course that's wrong.\n\nNo, I don't automatically say something negative.
