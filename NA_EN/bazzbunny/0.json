IM sure if Riot didn't implement this feature you would surely get banned. But since muting is an option.

I knew a guy who spammed **gger all game every game and didn't get banned for over 6 months.  When did he get banned?  the day after he posted here on forum that he spams **gger at people all game every game.  \n\nPlus you can spam ping everyone all game and riot doesn't care/track it so doubt they do anything for this","replies":[]}]}
