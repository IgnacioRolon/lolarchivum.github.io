The Rework process has the same dedicated resources and time constraint as new champions so essentially, Riot IS making a new champion with a preexisting template. They're not half-assing the effort.\nWith the Rework in mind, i am fully aware that Eve's lore is likely to change (finally moving out of her \"assassin for hire\" trope) as well as her VO and model.\n\nIf Riot correctly identfitied Eve's core pillars that they rebuilt her upon, i wouldn't care if her look from what we have now changes.

I feel the same thing as with Eve. If Riot identifies Morgana's core pillars correctly, rebuilding her around them would give us an improved Morgana that everyone is already familiar with.\n\nYou can't really express your mastery as a Morgana player outside of only being good at predicting the Q bindings really well. And that's a skill that's pretty easily acquired. New Morgana players have  ~7% higher win rate with her than masterful players with 200+ games on her. That's pretty wrong in my opinion. This means that Morgana currently isn't a good champion to one trick in general as you play her more, you run into a wall.\n\n_Considering that Xayah and Rakan were released in pairs (two champions), i think Riot has fair experience on duo releases so Kayle and Morgana wouldn't look like experiments._","replies":[{"poster":"GrReaper96","date":"2017-04-19T01:47:14.028+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"AD Eve {{item:3748}} {{item:3078}} {{item:3153}} is pretty good right now since the botrk buffs.\n\nThe only thing i want to stay on eve is her passive and one on-hit proc spell.
