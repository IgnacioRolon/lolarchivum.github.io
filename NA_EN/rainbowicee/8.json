Do you know how stressful the rest of the team is? You can&#039;t even be responsible for own actions anymore. &quot;We need help, i&#039;m getting beaten by this champion i picked into because i picked a meta champ i can&#039;t use for shit.&quot; \r\n&quot;JUNGLER WHY AREN&#039;T YOU GANKING FOR ME, CLEARLY I NEED YOU TO TOWER DIVE HIM EARLY AND GIVE HIM YOUR BUFFS SO I CAN COMPLAIN AT YOU&quot; \r\n\r\n&quot;GG This jungler sucks at babysitting&quot;\r\n\r\n&quot;Oh look he&#039;s getting all the dragons but not winning the lane for me&quot;\r\n\r\n&quot;omg their jungler is ganking us, where&#039;s our jungler at. You&#039;re supposed to stand on the river and cover for us&quot;\r\n\r\n&quot;Why isn&#039;t he giving me blue? i need it so i can die in the lane again and hand it over to the enemy&quot;\r\n\r\n&quot;oh look junlger is getting invaded by my laner and their junlger imma just farm and complain that he isn&#039;t ganking, he&#039;s behind in levels and possibly his fault too their making their way to my lane atm about to kill me even though he&#039;s pinging below me for help&quot;\r\n\r\nMy champion pool is large, i play any role i&#039;m better at some champs than others of-course but my general playstyle is that i&#039;m patient and i know how to roll with the team. \r\n\r\n**TOP** Can find lot&#039;s of Opportunities to TP bot if they ward the bushes closes to the enemy tower not only that after they push their lane or shove it they can also go mind to gank or counter jungle with their jungler. If you play a tanky champion top when the rest of the team is squishy your build is viral for the rest of the team&#039;s success don&#039;t just build squishy too if you can help it.\r\n\r\n**MID** ROAM! Learn to ROAM If your champion can do it, the biggest challenge on this is if your opponent can make it across the lanes faster than you but even so ward and warn your team mates but also make your way too if you can.\r\n\r\n**BOT &amp; Support** Biggest issue i&#039;ve had when i&#039;m playing jungler is that Bot lane loves to push to tower and not ward. If you run out of wards and have no idea where the enemy jungler is back up! LEARN TO BACK UP! let them push back give your jungler or mid a chance to come bot and gank too and deny their jungler a chance to gank\r\n\r\n**Jungler** The biggest counter i&#039;ve ever had being a jungler is having the enemy team warding and playing safely. My success depends on their mistakes. IF they stay too low under tower i can dive them and kill them but if they pot accordingly and stay with in safe lines that&#039;s just dangerous territory. Clearing all the jungle creeps and having no lane to potentially gank is like the biggest counter i&#039;ve ever dealt with. Only choice left at this point is dragon and herald or guess where the enemy jungler will gank. \r\n\r\n**Every general lane** There is a safety line depending on the champion that you should not cross. Don&#039;t just shove in to their tower all the times unless you&#039;re dominating enough to kill their jungler. Even if you ward some jungles can still catch you in time like {{champion:120}} so Just play safe and be patient. \r\n\r\n**Support** You are the biggest counter to junglers, hands down. Supports are the biggest cockblocks of the whole game. Assasin&#039;s hate them, junglers hate them, tanks hate them. But i mean actual support. {{champion:63}} Is just another victim to me if i&#039;m ganking, {{champion:201}} {{champion:267}} {{champion:117}}  are a night mare to deal with.\r\n\r\nTL;DR Stop bitching soo much, you all can do much more in your role than you give yourself credit for.","replies":[{"poster":"WalkingInACircle","date":"2017-06-03T15:06:45.860+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You realize the reason they're so stressed is because of how powerful the role is? Most people have already found that the team with the better jungler wins 70+% of the time. The jungler is worth any other two positions because they are the playmaker early game and early game is everything.","replies":[{"poster":"RainbowIcee","date":"2017-06-03T16:06:06.123+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"^ this isn't true at all. Every position is valuable, and there are many ways to counter a jungler and punish them for camping. When I get ganked I don't feel it was because the jungler is too much i feel i made a mistake and often enough ganks don't only come from the jungler it comes from anywhere. If anything a gank from the top laner is sometimes the scariest from a backline TP.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zero Skill Tank","date":"2017-06-03T15:34:30.949+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Exactly. Players pressure their jungler more than ever, because junglers are more relevant than ever - and they were the most important role since freaking season 2 or 3.\n\nJunglers still gain XP way too fast. If a jungler comes to gank toplane on lvl 3, minions dying in process will usually lift them to level 4 - BEFORE both toplaners. This is riddicoulus.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"EmperorPengu","date":"2017-06-03T14:55:33.994+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Love this \nU get a upvote","replies":[]},{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-06-03T14:32:43.745+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"no one ever blames themselves, haven't you learned that by now?","replies":[]}]}
