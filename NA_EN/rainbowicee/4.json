Veigar doesnt need 2k ap with 700 he can easily q r a really beefy fighter none the less an assassin wait 3 seconds for his q again who for anyone who chases him while he kited through the cooldown. Thats ignoring his used to be hard to hit w until riot sped up the cast time then lowered the cooldown after  based on a pitiful amount of every 50 ap he gets from his passive.\nRiot creates burst mages without adhering to the fundemental rule of what burst mages do just as much as burst mages doing large amounts of damage in 1 chunk is their thing big wind up times and  long down times after trying to do the big damage are their thing Riot picked the big bright part and threw out all the coutner balancing pieces.","replies":[{"poster":"Handy Sandy ","date":"2018-02-13T12:40:55.429+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Its not his job but considering his place in fights with the saftey of his position, \n\nveigar is not safe at all, the only reason why he may seem safe is because of his E which many champions can either flash over or wait it out forcing him to fall back taking him out of range of the fight unless he just want to ult and die.\n\n>in kit peel, defensive options he is pretty safe.\n\nYea this is the exact opposite of Veigar.
