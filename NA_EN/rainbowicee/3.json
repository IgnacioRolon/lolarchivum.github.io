I told them, repeatedly, that we would lose if we all went mid because that was certain death. Was it? Yes. Dispite my sister's and my work, they fired the obliteron laser 5 times! Did my teammates ever leave mid when they noticed it wasn't working? No.\n\nThe best part was when they were roaming CONSTANTLY during the defending phase. Enemies pushing mid and bot while Himer and Sivir are holding off 2 at top fine? Better abandon both bot and mid turrets to 3 man gank top. The entire phase. We actually survived longer with them at our nexus turrets than at the outer ones because I could just put my turrets down and go ham on them without fear of having to relocate everything to defend a tower. I managed to get an equal amount of kills with less deaths then the two assassins who were going for kills.
