He was always a tanky battle mage.  He pays for his strengths by being less bursty and less reliable at long range than a lot of mages.\nHis strengths are spread out, something like:\n7/10 tank/sustain\n6/10 damage\n5/10 reliability/range\n5/10 utility/CC\n2/10 mobility/invulnerability\n\nOther mages, like let's say {{champion:134}} or {{champion:34}}, would usually be more like:\n3/10 tank/sustain\n7/10 damage\n7/10 reliability/range\n6/10 utility/CC\n2/10 mobility/invulnerability\n\nBoth come out to 25 points in this arbitrary distribution.  In reality, Swain might be slightly overpowered, with like an extra 0.5 points spent somewhere in his power budget.  Riot will probably nerf him if he gets about 3% play rate in any one lane with his current win rate.  Still, it isn't a problem that he's tankier than other mages because it's good to have unique power distributions as long as their total power budget still balances out.","replies":[{"poster":"RainbowIcee","date":"2018-03-18T01:15:11.392+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree that seems to be swains role but he just does too much damage now before even scaling, so his raw damage needs to be toned down a bit or at least the CD needs to be slightly higher and thank goodness riot is doing that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Captatrix","date":"2018-03-18T20:50:32.329+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you don't mind, as I main him, I'd like to correct some of your ratings:\n\n-5 tank/sustain, scales up to mid game and then falls off hard: Swain can be bursted, executes shit on him hard, his sustain is relatively reliable but not passive - he can't fight to low HP and then stay in lane solo to heal up\n+7/10 his damage can be _a bit_ unreliable and can be built against but he does _a lot_ of damage.\n+6/10 his reliability is underestimated though he'll never ever catch a good Zed during an all-in.\n+7/10 his utility is higher than Jhin's. Amazing synergy with team, safe too. It is debatable whether he can be a full-fledged support but he sure as hell can go as one without trolling.\n2/10 mobility/avoidance - yup. Besides baiting people in with ult he has no real options of escape, even CC has a ton of counterplay.\n\nAt the same time, I'd argue that a well played Syndra has reliability rating borderline 9/10, better range, same waveclear, siege range aoe fast stun with melee usability. So yeah, it probably evens out.\n\nPS since this talks about upcoming nerfs I'll give my own 2c: his trades against squishies should probably be nerfed but  here's the thing: he actually really freaking loves Abyssal and it's about to be nerfed heavily. He used to love GLP but now it's meh on him (no HP).
