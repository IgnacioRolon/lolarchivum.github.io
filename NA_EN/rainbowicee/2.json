While some may think &quot;oh but you should be doing that regardless of your role&quot; there&#039;s a specific thing that the support role has that other roles don&#039;t. The capability to do everything. They can tank, damage, CC, peel, gank, cover, bait, give vision, ultimately carry and you carry on that advantage when you pick support, all you have to do is analyze the situation and see how you can take advantage of it. I mostly play support, it&#039;s my go to role when wanting to win but when i do play other roles i find myself concentrating on warding, vision and taking care of any iffy thing the team is missing out. Now i think if everyone would get used to helping out in every game would go a lot smoother and eventually more good games would happen.

The problem right now is that you try and put supports as this learning experience. But new or bad players more than likely aren't going to get anything from support than \"this sucks\". And support is actually teaching the same mechanics you should be learning normally as pretty much any other role. You don't pick {{champion:45}} if the entire enemy team is AD. You don't pick {{champion:40}} with people like {{champion:420}}.\n\nTo me the support role is so stale that I like playing the older poke supports like {{champion:76}} with just pure damage over playing actual supports.
