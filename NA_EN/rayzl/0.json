You will need to update your Avast Antivirus definition files and there may still be a possibility that the League of Legends patcher won't properly launch as the required files may have already been quarantined. If that's the case, please follow the steps below to restore the files:\n\n> You can restore the file from Avast Virus Chest by following these steps:\n> \n> Open Avast and go to > SCAN > Scan for viruses > Quarantine (Virus Chest) > select the file you need to restore, right-click on it and click on \"Restore\".\n> After this the file is restored back in it's original location and it won't be recognized as a suspicious file.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SKTDeathWalker71","date":"2017-03-29T10:21:01.867+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Get on your knees and pray to god, if you are really desperate cry while you are praying but don't fake cry, only cry if tears are actually coming.
