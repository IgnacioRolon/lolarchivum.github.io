But I&#039;ve played for 5 1/2 years now. This game keeps getting more and more unbalanced, to the point where you can&#039;t even play it anymore. One shots at lvl 11 are normal now. You look at the item list, and it&#039;s all Attack items. You have to scroll down a long ways, to find the most costly defense item. That&#039;s just the unbalanced part of the game though...\r\n\r\nI&#039;m sure I don&#039;t have to dive to deep, to meet other players, who despite winning, doing well, working together etc, in a game. Players are just straight buttholes. I literally can&#039;t find a single game, where someone isnt&#039; cussing or being toxic to me or someone else. I do very well, personally. I&#039;m not salty over losing. I don&#039;t really care about my rank. It&#039;s just that fact that you can&#039;t even get a fair match anymore. You either get a janna top, or garen support. On top of people being able to try a champ for the first time in ranked, you also have to deal with the fact that every match you play, will either be a complete landslide victory, or it&#039;ll be a complete stomping, and loss of lp. I can&#039;t remember the last time I had a close game, and it was fun.\r\n\r\nWhy not make players have a certain mastery level, to be able to play that champ in ranked?\r\nWhy not just perma mute repeat toxic players, forever? Instead of giving them 4234234234 chances, before you ban them.\r\nWhy not make some top tier defense items, that actually matter at post 30 min?\r\nWhy not nerf some of the attack items, so that every assassin in the game, can&#039;t one shot a tank?\r\n\r\nAnyways, my opinion probably doesn&#039;t matter to most, but I wanted to say i&#039;ve had enough. I&#039;ve supported this game with money, social media, and playing. I&#039;ve finally had enough. I literally played 7 games today, and despite winning and losing some, every single game was a toxic slug fest. I&#039;m over it. Bye League of Legends that I no longer know. You used to be fun, but now you&#039;re annoying. lol","replies":[{"poster":"Umbral Regent","date":"2018-03-28T23:30:58.801+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Why not make players have a certain mastery level, to be able to play that champ in ranked?\n\nWhat use would such an arbitrary prerequisite be?

Also with the mastery thing, gotta take bans into account, I agree it's a bad idea.

As to the let alone thing, I'm pretty sure it's supposed to go \"realistic or actual thing\" let alone \"expectation or unrealistic thing\" depending on the situation of course. So it would be \"I rarely see any cases of people going over thirty chances, let alone breaking triple digits\".  I may have explained that wrong, but the example should clear it up. Oh yeah, you said it yourself; small thing let alone big thing.","replies":[{"poster":"Umbral Regent","date":"2018-03-30T22:44:36.635+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah, many thanks.
