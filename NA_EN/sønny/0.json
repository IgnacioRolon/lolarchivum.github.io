There might be something in your config files that aren't working quite right which is stopping them from being saved. Let's try resetting those config files to see if that gets it saving right again.\n\n- Log into the game client\n- Navigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\n- Delete the file  named **game.cfg** and **persistedsettings.json**\n- Go into a custom game and verify that settings have saved properly. \n- Leave game to sync settings","replies":[]}]}
