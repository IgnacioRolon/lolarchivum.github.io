Which painfully results in to me having to play the waiting game of 5 to 20 minutes because the system thinks I purposely dodged. Now I do admit my laptop is quite old and I need to replace it sooner rather than later, but before the new client this had never been a problem before.\r\nSo, rioters and rito-senpai, what do you think I need to do?\r\nJust become addicted to bejeweled again and hope the gods send enough money so I can by myself a new desktop?\r\nOr maybe there is a bug that needs to be fixed?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-10T20:01:55.496+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The recent patch did enable a new option to toggle performance on the client, in case your issue has been sluggish performance.

Just look for \"lol.launcher\"\n\nLet me know!","replies":[]}]}
