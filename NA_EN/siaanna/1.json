A real-world timeline of currently written stories in the \"Game Info\" section (it could be placed between the \"Champions and Items\" and \"Customize Your Summoner\" parts.)\n\n2.  Add a section on the website devoted to Lore (between Esports and Boards).\n\n3.  Pin a sticky post with links to all the story sites at the top of the \"Story, Art & Sound\" boards\n\nSomething should be done for the lore, even if it's not the \"ideal\" solution Riot keeps searching for but never seems able to deliver in a timely manner.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fisk","date":"2016-06-10T01:58:25.496+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is there anyway you guys could do a quick fix type thing? Like just a page with a few links to the other story pages... It is a really frustrating problem, that seems super simple to solve... I don't want to be rude but I think this could be one of those situations where Riot over thinks things, when we just want something simple :(. I love the quality product you guys have created, but sometimes you guys take so long with a product, players have forgotten/don't care/are just to frustrated and impatient to be excited about it.\n\nEdit- Thanks for the response though by the way. It's always nice to at least hear about these things from rioters, definitely a +1 in my book.
