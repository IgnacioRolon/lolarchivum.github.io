I congratulate my team when we get Dragon, Baron, they get kills, or we all do. I praise my support every time they do well, even if it includes them dying for the cause. I really enjoy teamwork. It's what makes games fun for me. I put my best foot forward in every match. For several reasons:\n\n1. I Want To Win. \n\nI LIKE winning. I know the casual Leaguer doesn't care about winning, but their playing effects me. \"It's just a game.\" I hear this line all the time. Because it is MY progress, and my skills that aren't improving. I don't blame my mistakes on others. I will take full responsibility for my own actions. I even find it fun losing if both teams are evenly matched. The match itself is fun. That said, I shouldn't have to protect myself for this ideology of \"I like winning\", but I do because someone will accuse me of something later on anyways.\n\n2. I Like Teamwork. \n\nAs previously mentioned, it makes games more enjoyable for me. And as much as it is just a game, I prefer to have good communication and strategize with my team for the best outcome. I don't know anyone who advocates against teamwork. I DO know players that just ignore it instead of advocating against it. This upsets me because I'm not a freelo player. I don't have the means to carry players higher in the ranking system. Especially in this current Ranking system (But that is something not relevant to this topic). I'll play with you, not for you. This goes for me, when I play with you (If I do).\n\n3. Team Composition.\n\nThis is important to me. I'll travel through groups on Teambuilder for like 10 minutes trying to find a team that isn't all Assassins. Like seriously? A room full of glass with a wrecking ball is a more balanced team. All Tanks? How are we supposed to get anything done if we have no damage? These are just a few examples. I hope you get the jist. Variables like CC, and abilities per champ, etc. are fine and dandy. They really are. But a team needs a really good balance. This is what I see Pros advocate. YouTube is full of videos saying things about how they team did great because the CC was balanced with Damage and sustain, etc.\n\n4. I Hate Watching A Lane Collapse.\n\nThis is true for any lane, especially my lane. I train hard with whatever Champion I play in whatever lane I play, so I am not the problem or the burden of the team. Normally (not always), my lane stands the longest. This is definitely not bragging. I screw up just like everyone else. I just put my crazy ideas into play and hold for my teams sake. I'll ping MIA, Assist (in my lane or in the lane that needs it the most), Danger (most of the time because I see an enemy walking from a lane or a ward towards my allies, I use this probably the most), or just Pings to ask that they hide in a bush or behind a wall, or even to point out a bush that is warded. I will assist any lane that needs it whenever I am able as soon as I am able. Even if it means I lose a turret (which I hate).\n\n5. I Am Competitive.\n\nI want my team to be successful. I'm not the best. But I am definitely far from the worst teammate. I DO get intense in some matches because I feel that the other players are making light of the match. I am competitive. I'm trash talked often (but not always, thank goodness) by my own team claiming I'm being toxic when I just ask why they are doing what they are doing (chasing obvious bait, leaving a full turret when reinforcements are on the way, Running from teamfights). I really don't get pissy until the extreme cases happen. We will get to that soon. Blatant feeders, non-communicative teammates, intentional griefing, etc. Those people piss me off. Making light of the effort I put into the match and how I do or don't play the game, is bad enough. Outright sabotaging the game should be bannable.. oh wait..\n\n\nSo here is an example of some of this. with people I'm in a party with.\n\nI ask where they want me. \"It don't matter.\" Okaaay... I wait til they pick and figure I'll fill. Support is Braum. Sweet. Things are looking up. So I ask for ADC. I go MF. I mained her before the rework and haven't played her much lately because of that. We get in the game. I get my items, and head to lane. Jungle Shyvana asks for help at Krumps. I'm happy to oblige. (Note Shyvana is not in our party) Braum stayed at base till the last second, I didn't think about it twice. He joins us at Krumps. Krumps pops up and I immediately lay down the firepower on the small one as Shyvana wanted a hard leash for smiteless Krumps. He thought Enemy Lee Sin was gonna invade red. Braum doesn't participate with Krumps. Shyvana takes too much damage at Krumps, even with me hard leashing her. Shyvana dies at Red from Red. No Lee. It's fine since the enemy didn't benefit from it. Shyvana commented that she needed Braum to help with leash. He didn't say anything (in fact doesn't talk the entire time).\n\nWe go to the lane and Braum hits Leona with his Q. I get 2 stacks on her and chased her away. So I target Tristana. We win the trade. Then it goes downhill from there. Braum just stands by turret. I try to figure out why since we weren't falling behind. He does this for the next two minutes. It get's too dangerous for me to farm or harass. I barely get out of there and I tele to base. He is still just standing there. (I assume maybe it's connectivity issues) I can't buy anything then head back to lane. He then attacks Leona and Tristana by himself, without a minion wave and in their minion wave. Mind you he charged out from Turret to do this. He just dies. So now I have to hold turret from a super aggressive bottom lane.\n\nStill haven't said anything. Lag? Maybe. Then under turret he just stands as I'm dived. I get away thanks to Shyvana, but he dies. Now I'm like \"wtf is going on?\" So I ask Braum what he is doing. (Remember he doesn't talk the whole game) He walks away from Turret when it is at half health and I'm there poking Leona and Tristana. This is after him just sitting at base for no reason. So I have to abandon Turret, but before I can get away I get killed. We lose Turret.\n\nOur Yasuo is feeding Malzahar in mid. Top Riven is getting destroyed by Garen. I'm not even caring about those lanes since I have to figure how to keep mine intact. I go mid to help Yasuo and I get a kill, but he dies. Braum is now like 4 levels behind the rest of us now and we lose bottom Turret. So we are at inhib turret before 15 minutes. Yup. 15 mins. I ask Yasuo, who is the one I know, where he found this Braum. How he is playing was pissing me off because he was feeding. Yasuo told me that Braum was a real life friend. That doesn't bother me. The fact that I'm soloing bottom lane by myself after doing nothing to Braum to make him feed or abandon lane.\n\nRiven I had played with before says he is sick of playing with me because I am terrible at ADC (which he is good, I don't care if he is or isn't better at ADC) and he does it better and I'm a terrible Support (Out of like 10 games we lost 2, I was his Support and I fed him hardcore all the games we won and I tried my best in the games we lost.) But, one time I got upset because they were essentially throwing a match and I was distraught. I screwed the team by going smiteless on accident and I was upset but even though I didn't have smite I still got kills and assists and they collapsed because of bait and other. Afterwards I blamed myself and apologized for getting upset.\n\nSee above reasons.\n\nThis is the game after that one. So Riven starts insulting me, because Braum cost us bottom and I'm 3/1/0 (I had singlehandedly ganked Lee Sin and killed him as MF, but I'm terrible at ADC apparently.) The game was easily lost at this point and they are basically planning to kick me from the party for any future games. Because Braum fed. I was flabbergasted. The game ended with us getting destroyed. I was 3/1/0. Shyvana was 2/5/2. Riven was 0/2/2. Yasuo was 2/4/2. Braum was 0/6/1.\n\nIs this something I'm causing? Is being competitive enough to be ostracized by players? Wanting the above mentioned things to be accessible in League, is that what makes me a \"bad player\"? Am I allowed to be justifiably pissed off at obvious, intentional misplays? Doing something on accident is one thing. This was something entirely different.\n\nI would like honest, constructive criticism. I don't want people just calling me a bad player or trash because I'm not Diamond I. I mean you can, I'll just ignore you. How can I improve teamwork with teams that don't want to work together? I've heard the \"mute all\" theory. Even muting people doesn't improve their or my performance for the better. I just want to improve.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Boltrix","date":"2015-10-01T06:53:37.268+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Um, I'd like to give you an honest answer, but could you break up that giant block of a paragraph, buddy?

The only way to counter a 1v2 is to have luckily picked and played a champion who can naturally 1v2, like if I were going Mordekaiser ADC, I wouldn't win the lane, but I could drag out the bot lane long enough that my opponents were not going anywhere to roam without my knowing, not unless they wanted to lose the lane, because.. well, hue.\n\nBut that is going as an ADC with built-in shield, sustain, and poke in his E, and not restricted by mana in any way.\n\nAt that point, what do people expect you to do, play a champion who can 1v2 on the expectation your support would AFK? There are some situations that are unwinnable unless your team comp 4v5 is just that much stronger or your opponents are as a whole are unskilled or completely uncoordinated. The phrase 'sh*t happens' is never more apparent than then, it happens for you and your opponents, and we just move on from there.\n\nCan you get better?\n\nOf course you can, but to have won that situation without an appropriate champion, you would have had to be able to outplay your opponents so well that you could win the lane regardless of the existence of a lane partner or not. And the system is supposed to pair you up with people who are of theoretical similar skill as yours, so you see the issue of this mutually exclusive situation where you have to be so much better than your opponent to win at a numerical disadvantage, but the system in theory should ensure you all face proper opponents to ensure fair combat.\n\nIn other words, the only way you could have won that was by smurfing, and that certainly doesn't answer that properly.\n\nMy advice? You did fine, people naturally become upset and try to look for anyone but themselves to criticize and vent upon others to make themselves feel better, it's the whole support beam behind the circlejerk of rage in our community. And in their case, Riven has a hard time against Garen even before the rework, and Malzahar punishes 'all-in assassins' like Zed, Yasuo, and Fizz for trying to tower dive him with his pool and his suppress.\n\nMy best friend mains Malzahar and plays Garen top on occasion, I would know all about that.\n\nSo yeah, move on from this, you seem like a very swell dude, it's a road bump, you'll get past it and you will become a better person for it; the fact you asked others how you could improve is already a sign you're a step ahead of your peers.","replies":[{"poster":"SuicideJ","date":"2015-10-02T02:45:00.146+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I want to get better but anytime I try a champ, Riot blows them up til they are the worst champ in the game. I don't like how several ADC's play so I really stopped playing ADC and decided to do top. I did well for a while but lanes are too unreliable. 1 person can lose the match for you. I've never been a fan of assassin teams because they refuse to see the bigger picture. In Ranked, I don't get to pick my team like I can in teambuilder. I'll keep getting players who think killing champions wins matches. It certainly helps, but if you lose all your turrets and inhibs and kill their entire team but they destroy your nexus. You lose. It's hard to explain that to players.\n\nI'm currently at the bottom of Silver IV after being in the promo games for Silver III.

Best to just write the game off as a loss and focus on having fun / improving other skills. Make mini-games out of trying to get the highest farm, or keeping the best places warded. That way it doesn't feel like completely wasted time.\n\nIf you still want to be competitive / win badly, then these kinds of games are when it is paramount to compliment teammates for good plays, especially that toxic Riven. It is much harder for them to stay mad at you if you keep being nice to them. (Note, being nice and being a pushover are two different things, don't believe them if they start calling you trash or saying things are your fault)\n\nIn response to your question, no I don't think its you. That sounds like uncooperative teammates. Don't doubt yourself, and don't take on more than your share of any blame that may be flung about.\n\nIt is possible that you have some trouble with tilting. I sure do. It helps me to take a 5 minute break in between games, to step outside, breath some fresh air, and get a snack from the kitchen. That way my mind is clearer for the next match. But I dunno if you struggle with the same problem.\n\nHope this helps, let me know if you have any other questions as well, I may not be the best of players, but I greatly enjoy discussing the psychology of teamwork, tilt, and other topics related to league. I also know of some interesting guides you might like if you are interested in those topics as well.\n\nBest,\nHalcyonDweller","replies":[{"poster":"SuicideJ","date":"2015-10-01T08:18:34.779+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the advice! I am, by nature, an overthinker. So I tend to think more along the lines of it's my fault when I'm not doing as good as I should be. I also tend to apologize to my teammates a lot. I love to compliment my team, because we can usually work together to make a terrible situation into a fun close game that may include victory for us. My last game was like that. I had to seriously catch up because I was missing so many Blitz pulls.. It was sad :( But our team survived several atrocities and we ended up winning our team fights and even the match! I probably said \"gj\" about 100 times xD They carried me hard, but I did my best to protect my teammates even though I still died.\n\nI love tactics/strategy/psychology behind how players perform. It's quite amusing watching enemy players chase you when the bait is obvious. They always fall for it. Sometimes I am legit trying to get away and I manage to pull some quick moves and kill them and get away. It get's your blood pumping!
