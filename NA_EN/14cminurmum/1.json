Especially the dev team or \"lore\" makers. I recently name changed to Flocks of Teemo, but it just dawned on me that I may be inaccurately describing the scientific grouping of multiple Teemo.  I would like to ask for solid input from all of you at Riot if it is indeed a flock or iff it is a different collective name. Also I would like to know if the plural of of Teemo is in fact Teemo or if it may be Teemi or Teemos. \r\n\r\nI really need help on this subject and it is of the utmost importance.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-11-03T16:08:32.843+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let's be real here, it's clearly a *murder of Teemos.*","replies":[{"poster":"14cminurmum","date":"2017-11-03T16:19:43.645+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So Teemos is the plural?","replies":[{"poster":"Modi","date":"2017-11-04T23:46:02.647+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It really should be Teemoes, like \"tomatoes\" or \"potatoes\", IMO","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2017-11-03T17:17:58.448+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hope you mean \"A *Nuisance* of Teemos.\"","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Narroc","date":"2017-11-04T17:42:28.523+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Mushrooms that are in a close group but not close enough to be called a cluster are said to be in a troop.

If you should form a group and play in a tightly organized fashion, you a Cluster, or if you are less organized, a Troop.
