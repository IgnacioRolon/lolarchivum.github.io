This was the second game in a row my own teammates banned the champ i picked.  In the second game the guy locked in teemo jungle with heal and ghost as his summoner spells.  I wish I could show you the chat but in the end I get punished because this is ranked and I dont want to waste a game with a clear troll!.  I told the team I would take the hit and dodged.  How can you report people for this when in the end they basically screw me over because now I have to wait X mins instead a taking a clear loss.  Please help!

I'll always attempt to engage the player before outright banning Sett - but if I start to ask how they play Sett, how they plan to synergize with other lanes, etc - and they either don't respond or it becomes clear they are playing Sett for the \"KDA factor\" of easy KDA but lack of teamwork, then damn right I'm going to ban it away from them.","replies":[{"poster":"Smiling Frog","date":"2020-02-26T19:33:06.560+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"dude wtf you talking about? first of all if you ban someone teamate champ is just because you had poor feed back withhim on previous game, and you want to avoid it. \n\ndude im french canadian you think I can describe you my gameplay in 10 second ? before you ban it , are you delusional. \n\nstop inventing some bullshit","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nightsky Pirate","date":"2020-02-25T06:19:27.422+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"Which is, of course, a very selfish reason to ban first pick Sett.

Play draft/ranked if you want to be able to ban champions/have your champion banned. Its literally the design of the game mode. As far as troll picks, Riot would have to implement a defined meta game that forces certain champion/rune combinations. That probably wont happen, but I'd be curious as to what they would allow. \n\nThey could also implement a system that doesnt allow you to ban a hovered champ, but then that hover would basically be like you locking in your champ lol. Might as well just have \"other team\" bans  but I have a feeling that would just create a meta of counter bans, where if you ban sett, the other team will also ban sett because they might think youre gonna pick him since you banned them. \n\nOR there could be a system where you just cant ban hovers. But then what if you switch your hover every 2 seconds? Idk how that would work exactly. What if youre last pick and you want kassadin, but im playing anivia mid and cant ban him, but enemy mid picks first and goes kassadin. Id be pretty pissed lol. I dont like that idea. \n\nI think just ban whatever you want is the best way. If it happens often to you, then youre playing a popular champ and thats just something youre gonna have to deal with. Play one of the other 150 champs lol. If you think the bans are malicious, stop hovering your pick and no one can purposely fuck you over.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Annestria","date":"2020-02-25T10:28:24.562+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"You could try not maining a character that is pretty much Perma banned on entry into champion select.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Janumba","date":"2020-02-26T19:00:33.716+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well it wasn't just that he banned Sett.
