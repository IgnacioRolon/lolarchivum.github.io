Right now, it really is jarringly loud. Strange as it may sound, I think reducing the default volume would actually get more people listening to the music, because fewer people would go \"SWEET TEEMO THAT IS LOUD\" and immediately hit the \"disable login music\" button.\n\nHave you tried doing some informal tests, comparing the decibel levels of, say, a typical YouTube music video (at max volume) to the login screen music? When my computer is set to a volume that works well for other applications, I find that LoL still comes on deafeningly loud. I might be wrong, but I've heard enough people make jokes about how incredibly loud the LoL login music is that I think there really is a difference.","replies":[{"poster":"CyberTootie","date":"2015-03-11T04:49:16.971+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=CupcakeTrap,realm=NA,application-id=aAJWt2b9,discussion-id=A90hcb8a,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2015-03-11T01:40:32.492+0000)\n>\n> ...but I've heard enough people make jokes about how incredibly loud the LoL login music is that I think there really is a difference.\n\nI try.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mandaari","date":"2015-03-11T03:59:58.998+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Youtube videos are the quietest thing ever though.

Actually, for me, both the login music and YouTube at max volume was also deafeningly loud. I think what's going on is that Netflix is super, super quiet, so I have my system turned up really high.\n\nStill, given that there's no obvious volume control for the login music (you have to go into a menu to find it), whereas YouTube has a convenient volume slider, I think there's an argument to be made for setting LoL's default in the midrange rather than max volume. If you took away YouTube's volume slider, I think it'd probably be better for it to default to 50% than 100%.","replies":[{"poster":"CyberTootie","date":"2015-03-11T04:43:49.979+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"League of Legends music is historically very loud, YouTube audio is presented as each video's audio is uploaded to them (They do not alter audio streams beyond audio codec compression) and Netflix I'd expect would do the same. Unlike music, there is a standard volume movies typically adhere to, which, compared to \"louder is better\" music, is much, much lower in overall volume, and has oodles of dynamic range. I like dynamic range if you didn't know.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Voidac","date":"2015-03-10T08:23:47.664+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"It's fine for everyone else.
