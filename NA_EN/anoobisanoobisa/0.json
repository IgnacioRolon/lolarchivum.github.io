This would also promote the intendet idea of aram.\r\nIn connection with this I think upping the reroll numbers to 3 or perhaps 5 would be great. Or maybe, although I am not a fan of the Idea, introduce a &quot;Pay to reroll buttom&quot; for RP.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance and keep up the good work,\r\n\r\nsincerly Wollfred","replies":[{"poster":"Valderis Vandala","date":"2017-01-24T14:30:46.321+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you introduce this keep-your-champion-after-a-dodge you're just gonna see people dodging for other reasons, like when their teammates get bad champions.\n\nIf you happen to get a good champion but your teammate did not then it has the same consequences for your chance at winning, so you with the good champion can just dodge the game in the knowledge that you will keep your good champion and get another chance with a new team. This also makes keeping bad champions a mood point because its other people that dodge so the person with the bad champion will get a new one in the next game because he didn't dodge.\n\nI also think it would be better not to increase the amount of rerolls you get, but instead simply always have 2 rerolls available every game instead of this stupid charge system. It's this charge system that can't deal with spurts of bad luck, I can go a lot of games never having to use any reroll but then a unlucky game comes along and I'm forced to use both, leaving me in the hands of fate for a good number of games. If we simply always had 2 rerolls every game this would not be a problem.\n\nEDIT: I also think that giving 2 rerolls every match will lower the dodge rate, because everyone will be able to use them every game thus lowering the need to dodge games. At least somewhat.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Elite4Runner","date":"2017-01-24T07:34:57.676+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"As someone who also plays a lot of ARAM on this account, I think this would be a bad idea. \n\nI understand your logic, and I personally can agree that dodgers are incredibly irritating. The spirit of ARAM is to work with what you are given. \n\nHowever, forcing players to play a champion that they do not want to play is not really very healthy for the game. \n\nI feel that there will be two likely results to come from this. \n\n1. People will simply abandon the game mode completely until their rerolls reset. \n\n2. People will go ahead and play the game as that champion, but they will play very badly, or feed, troll, flame, or just afk, just so they can get to a new game where they may even get another champion that they don't want to play. \n\nI would honestly rather them just dodge so that I can get put back in que.","replies":[{"poster":"Minarde","date":"2017-01-24T23:06:30.749+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">forcing players to play a champion that they do not want to play is not really very healthy for the game.\n\nIt seems a little weird to have to appease people who are unwilling to play a random champion in a game mode specifically based around playing random champions.\n\nPersonally, I think even harsher punishments for dodgers/trolls would be preferable, but I understand where you're coming from.","replies":[]},{"poster":"anoobisanoobisa","date":"2017-01-24T10:08:53.629+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi there\nto 1) i dont see the problem with that\nto 2) maybee, but there are aready masures in place to punish people who do that (at least I think)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-01-24T09:20:13.509+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"The reason people dodge when they don't get a good champion is that there are so many ARAM-only accounts with nothing but good ARAM champions that if you don't get an ARAM-good champion you'll 90% lose so you might as well not even bother.
