There are times when I'm infuriated with league. There are times I wish Hyena Warwick had a tail. There are times when I'd kill for a even-toed ungulate anthro female champion.\n\nBut honestly, I like this game. I like the community (You're really not as bad as your rep!) I like the company. Its helped me calm my nerves, its helped me remain stable and far less miserable then I was in the past. I'm not well, but League is a reliable place to return and fall into. Where numerous  mental issues can be put on the wayside. Where I can for a time be happy.\n\nBasically;\nRiot, you're alright. You're not perfect. We're all often infuriated with the things you do. But know at least most of us don't take it personally! I mean, seriously. Game development is hard work, harder work with old spaghetti code as your basis.\n\nIf I could I would brew you all a cup of tea or something. But have a word of general thanks. Especially too those brave enough to interact with angry fans, like a certain parrot and a Mustache.","replies":[{"poster":"Huncho","date":"2014-11-27T02:17:40.801+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ChimeiTekinaNasu","date":"2014-11-22T00:32:17.374+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow.

I would like to reiterate what Iron Stylus has to say. I have suffered from depression for about 10 years now have been off and on meds most of my life. I also have chronic generalized anxiety, am victim to constant panic attacks, and have adult ADHD. This game.....this game.....its not an answer, but my goodness, it helps. I don't know why nor do I particularly care to understand in full, but I can get up every morning, for me 5:00pm, and have something to look forward too. I love this game and although there are a lot and I mean a lot of toxic flamers out there, I have also come across some of the nicest people you will ever meet. I have found friends and dare I say family  in this mighty League of Legends. Thank you Riot for giving me a reason to roll out of bed, and for giving me a connection to new friends and family. I love the lore, I love the game, and yes I love the community even the toxic flame, I love you too, so lets all get along and enjoy this wonderful game. Thank you again Riot.
