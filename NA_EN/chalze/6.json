Before since support wasn't as popular as it has been lately back then. Riot included support giving autofill protection since it wasn't a popular role. Or at least it felt like they just threw supports a bone to never be autofilled. Nevertheless, if you are autofilled in a game you typically get autofill protection, or just fill a game and get it like that easily.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Akali Prime","date":"2019-01-12T15:30:59.101+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"when you get autofilled and the person who got your main role hard feeds.\n\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-clap}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Snowdrift","date":"2019-01-12T09:23:52.494+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can still get your secondary role.
