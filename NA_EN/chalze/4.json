What if Riot made it so Inhibitors can only respawn each a maximum of 5 times?\r\nOf course it's not uncommon for Inhibitors to respawn once, it happens very frequently.\r\nInhibitors respawning twice isn't too uncommon\r\nInhibitors respawning 3 times, game's a bit lengthy, less common\r\nInhibitors respawning 4 times, that's very rare and by this point the game should be well over an hour or so\r\nInhibitors respawning 5 times? Now the game is just well over the highest percentiles of game lengths and should be closed by now\r\nInhibitors respawning more than 5 times? I'd say 95% of all games with Inhibitors respawning more than 5 times would be a hostage situation.\r\n\r\nThis way the hostages at least have hyper scaling hoards of Super Minions helping them close out the game somehow. I doubt hostages in this situation care about whether they win or lose, they just want to end. And even if it isn't a legitimate hostage situation, by the time Inhibitors spawn 5+ times, the game realistically would be 90 or so minutes long or over that.\r\n\r\nI dunno, just a suggestion, maybe this has already been suggested, if so then I dunno, I guess this is the equivalent of a 'shower thought suggestion'","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-10-18T03:14:59.198+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The only way for this sort of hostage game is if you get the following incredibly rare conditions:\n\n* A troll premade\n\n* Other team also all trolls\n\n* You (+ whoever else is not trolling) suck so much you cant find a way to close out the game with a full build, even suicide diving structures with a lichbane and full ap.\n\nIt is not a problem that needs a solution.","replies":[]}]}
