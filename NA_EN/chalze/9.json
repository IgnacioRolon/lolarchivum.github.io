Riot says that they don't prioritize the client since it doesn't really affect the actual gameplay all that much, well it really does when despite it saying Low Spec Mode, they still need to force in the fancy sound effects as well as animations for the Runes during champion select. Why? If it was proper Low Spec mode I'd expect to have no animations so the gameplay is ACTUALLY unaffected. As last pick, if I had to pick a counter to their (just before) last pick, choosing a champion and setting up runes on the fly is absolutely impossible.\r\n\r\nFrequent freezing of animations make it impossible to \"click early\" on certain runes and the default setting is always set to that you can't actually click ahead unless the previous line of runes has fully loaded with all it's flashy animations and sound effects. Why is this a thing? Why wouldn't you guys at Riot want Runes, something that can literally guarantee a win or loss, so inaccessible behind \"appearance\"?\r\n\r\nIf you guys actually want to implement a proper 'Low Spec' mode or hell, even a new mode called something like 'Minimal Spec' mode, get rid of all unnecessary animations in the entire client. It doesn't matter if it looks cool or not. We get used to it and it means absolutely nothing to anyone who has used the client for more than a week.","replies":[{"poster":"FQVBSina","date":"2019-06-26T14:04:02.005+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had these issues also.

If so, doesn't that reset like, every single setting? I have a very specific set of key bindings as well as in-game video settings. I could definitely take note of all of them but I'm just sure whether it's worth it, especially since I'm on Mac OS X","replies":[{"poster":"FQVBSina","date":"2019-06-26T15:39:38.004+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It was recommended to delete everything but I ended up not deleting my personalized files. I had my emotes bound to T which is the same key as my trinkets from back then when emotes came out and automatically got assigned to T. And this setting stayed.\n\nI feel like cleaning out the registry did most of the job and reinstalling just made sure all the registry related to league was reset.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"nut on mic","date":"2019-06-26T14:18:25.603+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lmao low spec mode lags even on my Gaming PC....","replies":[{"poster":"FQVBSina","date":"2019-06-26T15:02:06.238+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"See my comment below.","replies":[]}]}]}
