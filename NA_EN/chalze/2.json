She's very clearly a fit athletic toned build. Illaoi isn't call and muscular, she's quite thickset which is quite a departure from just \"tall and muscular\".","replies":[{"poster":"tamaya","date":"2019-09-13T10:36:19.200+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think the physique of Awaken music video fits her character.\nI am not saying that she is a loli and small like an anime character.\nHowever, I think that it would be too strong if she becomes more muscular in this mature impression.\n\nI'm sorry, I don't understand the subtle nuances of English because my native language is not English\nAnd one more, \"all the other girls\" is definitely more popular in the league.

You're obviously not artists or designers. There is something dull about working on a motive where you don't have artistic freedom. Of course this is used to sell a female skin!

I look at this splashart and I enjoy \"THE ART\" not what her body type is or what moral or sales influence hides behind it. I am even inclined to buy this skin just for the sake of the artwork (you bet your butt I'm downloading this wallpaper). I also want to add, I suck at league and at Riven.
