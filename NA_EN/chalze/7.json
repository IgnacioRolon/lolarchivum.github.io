I have to agree with other comments that normal is more toxic than ranked. \n\nIn normal, I have seen people saying things about my mom for the entire whole game (I don't want to repeat the exact words but you guys know) because I said: \"our adc never followed up in the team fight\". Everybody else in the team noticed the same problem and that's exactly why we were losing. That player's response was toxic because it was not even relevant to this game and the purpose was to make others feel bad. \n\nIn ranked, I have seen people insulting each other and trash talk like uninstall. Most of the time (not all), there is a point in it. Like yeah the jg could've ganked more, or chose a better time to engage. Because it's ranked, there is pressure to win and some people care more about winning, and that's why they got frustrated so easily. And I admit there are better ways to say the exact same thing, it's just the higher pressure in ranked makes it worse. \n\nI've played with friends from real life for ranked. They are nice people, but when it comes to ranked, yeah, they insult other people in the game, despite the fact that my performance in that game was even worse. Why? Clearly it's because my friends don't know those strangers and it's easy to take out the frustration on them. \n \nThe takeaway: after playing league for 4 years, I just don't care what other players say anymore. Sometimes online games with high competition just bring out the worst of us. And I know I'm just here to have some fun while try not to ruin the game for others.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Meowing Mango","date":"2019-12-13T16:50:24.560+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Meh, both are toxic. Saying one is better or worse doesn't do anything. There are people who flame hard in norms. There are people who flame hard in ranked. The difference is you lose LP in ranked for a loss.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AromaticSesame","date":"2019-12-13T08:03:51.664+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Recently climbed to plat 4. Have seen inting in both ranked and norms, toxic people the same. However, I am surprised at this middle elo, norms are often filled with players who are either:\n\n1) elo boosted and were totally bad and lost lanes completely to real plat/diamond opponents\n2) casual players who don't care about ranks and play quite casually, of course\n3) playing with three other friends\n\nSkill level? Mostly less competitive than players in ranked games. Toxicity? Absolutely equal if not even worse--they give up more easily and like to flame teammates for having a bad game, and such negative behavior is often used to persuade a faster forfeit.\n\nALSO have been bullied by premade team of 4 during pre-game selection phase. When some players are playing with friends, they watch less for their manner.\n\nYet, for norms you can totally go casual -- you don't get as tilted as losing a ranked game, even there could be players flaming around.","replies":[]},{"poster":"excelsheet1","date":"2019-12-13T00:02:42.460+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I honestly never encountered this toxicity people are always talking about.
