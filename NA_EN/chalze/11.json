Riot can absolutely argue that if the meta stayed the same for too long or lets say hypothetically if every champion was indeed perfectly balanced and had a 50% winrate and an equal amount of playrate amongst all champions (what a fantasy right?) people would get bored of the lack of something exciting and new.\r\n\r\nThis is what I want to argue against, and thus in a sense push Riot to get rid of metas entirely, which would fix the &#039;meta&#039; issues of constantly alienating certain champion types (and thus playerbases) as well as fixing the notion of &#039;Riot&#039;s just pushing flashy champions into the meta for LCS&#039;.\r\n\r\nI remember watching someone on YouTube (I think it&#039;s Rossboomsocks, though it might be someone else I&#039;m not entirely too sure) on why LoL hasn&#039;t died as of yet (or why long time mobas like DOTA2 haven&#039;t either). The replay-ability doesn&#039;t come from the meta, but from the human and social interactions we have in the game. Instead of trying to explain what I mean by that, Imma bring up something like a first person player campaign. Let&#039;s say the CoD MW series (that&#039;s Call of Duty: Modern Warfare for those who are unfamiliar with first person shooters). All of their campaigns are a thrill ride and each MW offers something new, however due to the campaign&#039;s linearity it&#039;s hard to replay the campaigns unless you&#039;re going for things like enemy intelligence (basically collectibles for achievements). Even with the introduction with lets say Steam Achievements, it&#039;s unlikely that you&#039;d be playing it for something like 2+ years which a lot of the LoL playerbase has. Many first person/third person campaigns have tried to address this with things like more collectibles, open worlds, side quests etc however the games in any genre that have the most replay-ability always boil down to two things: Mods, and Multiplayer aspects.\r\n\r\nOf course for LoL&#039;s case you can&#039;t mod it otherwise that&#039;d be cheating but what many games nowadays realize is that multiplayer games have far more replay-ability because every game will be played differently. No matter how stagnant patches may be or how un-interactive the map is, the people you play with and play against will be different in most of your games, giving it a human element of variety, and this is what keeps the game fresh, every single time. I mean just look at how much of a gold rush/mine battle royale games are nowadays and how seemingly dead (or short-lived I should say) campaign/singleplayer games are.\r\n\r\nSo what am I building up to exactly?\r\n\r\nLoL doesn&#039;t need meta changes to keep things interesting, in fact meta changes make things predictable and boring. It&#039;s the complete opposite effect. Metas get rid of a large portion of that &#039;human variety&#039; element because the mechanics are mostly the same for lets say someone like Talon who&#039;s amazing right now, his combos are relatively the same and countering him is relatively the same as well. Same goes for Zed, or Zoe or whoever else has a specialized burst combo/burst mechanics. What I propose is the opposite.\r\n\r\nImagine a world where every major item has a similar purchase rate, every champion has a similar pick/ban rate, every matchup had a 50% winrate, every Summoner Spell has a relatively similar pick rate and every rune has a similar pick rate; that there is no meta. Of course this is not easy but just imagine. That would mean each and every 140 (or so) champions would have exciting matchups because you literally don&#039;t know who you&#039;d play against and how that player would play against you. Strategies would be far more varied and matchups would be far less predictable. The game would be much more intuitive than it is now. This would really give every player an incentive to play whoever they wanted to rather than which champions wins require. Every champion would be effective in their own right and every champion would be able to be countered somehow for that intuitive gameplay.\r\n\r\nThat being said, this is absolutely impossible realistically, but in the past we&#039;ve been able to get pretty close before. Riot can absolutely get close to that fantasy of no one being the seasonal overpowered or underpowered champion. Of course there will still be counterpicks and counterplay due to the innate nature of certain champion abilities (e.g. Teemo&#039;s blind will always counter AA-reliant champions etc) but due to the vast amount of champions being played this way literally each game would be fresh, at least fresher than metas will ever make it.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, I&#039;d say metas, as much as they are moneymaking strategies for Riot with LCS or skins or whatnot, if not tuned back will most likely be the main cog of the machine in the downfall of LoL. If everything is meta, there is no meta, and I believe that&#039;s how the game should be. The game would be far healthier for literally everyone. And just a small note I apologize if I sounded toxic in writing any part of this but as someone who has played for nearly 6 years and despite me wishing death upon this game in the past, I truly don&#039;t want to see it go, at least not in flames like this. \r\n\r\nRiot, don&#039;t kill the game I fell in love with back in season 2 just because of corporate greed, both parties deserve a better and healthier game.\r\n{{sticker:sg-soraka}}","replies":[{"poster":"Jamaree","date":"2018-06-20T09:16:47.926+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"You do realize getting rid of the concept of meta is literally impossible right?\n\nAlso impossible to have a competitive game where every character has even play rates while keeping characters different.","replies":[{"poster":"Chalze","date":"2018-06-20T10:09:50.439+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Jamaree,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=gL8ctaFc,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-06-20T09:16:47.926+0000)\n>\n> You do realize getting rid of the concept of meta is literally impossible right?\n\nWhich is why I mentioned that we've gone pretty close to it before and we should strive to get closer to that balanced state.

We really need to widen that route so more champions/strategies/builds/whatever can be successful (and less toxic to play against).\nAs mentioned before, removing the meta completely I've already established is impossible to do completely, but we absolutely can widen that gap again.

Season 2, Leblanc comfortably sat at a 45% win rate that stayed there with champions like Morg, Janna, Kassadin being in the 50%+ at all times in all elos, guess who got complained about?\n\n> Everything is on average and as mentioned, we can absolutely decrease that range. Besides, Riot may not be able to &#x27;average up&#x27; the play rates of everyone but they can absolutely decrease the range of playrates (and thus increase the pool of viable champions)\n\nNo, that isn't how competitive video games work, if you were to nerf the champions with high win rates to the point where they are weaker, their counters then see more play and their win rates go up, then you have champions like Ryze and Azir who are shit in solo queue but competitive, dominate, and what about champions like Yasou who have a flat 50% at bronze and win rate drops even more at high elo but is still begged for for nerfs?\n\nThat is the thing about a meta, the HOPE is that by nerfing the top 10, the playing field gets more even, but that isn't how it works, instead a new top ten will come out, there hasn't been a constantly competitive game in history where this HASN'T been a thing, fighting games, shooters, MOBAs, all of them. Meta is actually short for Most Effective Tactic Available which means there will always be a cream of the crop period, no matter the game.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2018-06-20T09:23:50.714+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let me tell you why your post is a waste.\n\nPeople(competitive people who want to win) ALWAYS look for the best route to win.\n\nWhat is looking/creating that best route? a Meta.\n\nGames that have a ranked mode/PVP mode will ALWAYS have a meta.\n\n\nDifferent champions with different kits, along with different items will always create a meta.\n\n\n\nRiot cannot get rid of the idea of a meta, no one can.","replies":[]}]}
