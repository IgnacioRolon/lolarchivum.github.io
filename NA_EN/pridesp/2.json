So instead of trying to win the series for tournament progression, both teams are trying more to win each game because that will give them points required for tournament progression, usually in a round robin format. A good example of it is Dotapit (I believe) and it's becoming more popular in dota but not really other games.","replies":[]},{"poster":"xClitorisaurus","date":"2016-06-01T18:26:40.289+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"MeilinII","date":"2016-06-02T04:16:59.690+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is incorrect.
