Why do you think that is? I believe that besides the fact that is was one of the few original online games, it cemented its place by having an amazing story and they capitalized on that by creating animations and Mangas (comics) and even wrote dozens of books to completely immerse its fan base in the world of warcraft. League HAS that potential, with just the few bits and pieces of information that you guys have given us over the years with regards to champion lores and the league journals and stuff, the story is already AMAZING and you guys could do so much with that. the comics ARE AMAZING for new champs, that is a great start, and the animations you guys do are also incredible, so why not start a story line for each champ whether it be in comic book form or animation or even via online weekly releases of written chapters. I just feel like you guys are over looking this crucial factor with the league of legends universe. The foundation is already there, and im sure that if you guys asked for volunteers, there would be thousands. There are thousands of manga/comic book artists out there trying to get recognized, and even more writers.\r\n\r\nSo with all this said, I would like to speak to someone who deals with the league of legends universe and its lore.\r\n\r\nIf that is not possible, I am wondering if I could go find an artist/writer/animator myself and have them create lore for the league universe. I would not claim any ownership of any of the material and neither would  he,  we would give all rights to riot and whatever else is standard with these things. We (the thousands of fans interested in the lore) just want to dive and immerse ourselves with the league of legends universe and i know that countless others feel the same exact way. There is so much that you can do with the lore, and the people want it, so this would be purely from a fan&#039;s stand of point.  I know you guys have backed league comic book artists before, so If there is any procedures or anything that we need to avoid, please let us know.\r\n\r\nI know you guys receive dozens of requests about other equally important stuff but I would really appreciate it if you guys got back to me. Thanks for making such a great game!\r\n\r\n(Apologies for the wall of text this is just something I am super passionate about and have finally decided to take an action. Additionally, apologies for any grammar or editing errors and also if there is already a topic on this. I don&#039;t really use threads or forums and have no experience with them, this is my first time posting anything on any forum ever, pls Rito (and forum users) no Flamerino. If there is a post about this already, would you guys be able to direct me to it and any progress made?)\r\n\r\n(Also what is the process for making these types of things?)\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nThe Die Hard Lore Fans Of League","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2017-10-17T22:02:06.741+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"What did you think of the recent comics that were released?\n\n[Darius: Blood of Noxus](https://universe.leagueoflegends.com/en_US/comic/darius/bloodofnoxus/)\n[Nami: Into the Abyss](https://universe.leagueoflegends.com/en_US/comic/nami/intotheabyss/0/)\n[Ziggs & Jinx: Paint the Town](https://universe.leagueoflegends.com/en_US/comic/jinx-ziggs/paint-the-town/)\n[Miss Fortune: Fortune Smiles](https://universe.leagueoflegends.com/en_US/comic/missfortune/fortune-smiles/)\n\nIs that the sort of thing you're talking about?  \nMore like this?

There's huge holes in the lore and not ones for theorycrafting, holes like Soraka and Ziggs. They're lore makes 0 sense with the Warwick Rework and the new comic/region change for Ziggs. And so many other champs have no short story or complete bio, and it's really frustrating, especially when you're trying to get someone into the lore and you have to explain to them about all these unfinished characters with unused potential. Sorry if this comes across as salty, I love the direction you're taking the lore. I just really wish you completed it first before making big events and comics.","replies":[{"poster":"efflam","date":"2017-10-18T01:31:16.572+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I second everything that Bioluminescence said.\nWe are as exited as you are about updating all the hundreds of bios to be consistent.

The thing is, some players are less likely to engage with pages of text than they are comics or animations or other forms of media, and it seems like a good idea to me to try to ensure that those players are welcomed into the lore, same as those of us who actively seek out longer written content.","replies":[{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2017-10-17T23:52:28.071+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't have a problem with comics or animations being used to tell stories. I have a problem with comics or animations being used to tell stories we already knew about.\n\nFor example, that Nami story is just her updated bio with a bit more detail. It's nice, but it feels like a waste; we already know this story, so making a comic out of it is a waste of time and effort that could be spent on new stories.\n\nIt's not as bad as, say, Kalista's release, which had a long form lore, a short form lore, and an animation that basically all said the exact same thing, but I feel Riot is already 'behind' on getting lore out and they can't afford to spend too much time on one story.","replies":[{"poster":"KnightsKemplar","date":"2017-10-17T23:56:57.750+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's a decent point.

Unless the contain is revealing new information, I don't really need to see something that has already been told. It works for the newer players or people who aren't as involved in the lore. The Nami comic basically did a nice job at that. \n\nThe Darius comic or the Lux and Garen story are good ideas of stuff I personally, and what a lot of people like to see. It introduces more about the characters and shows us more about not only the champions we grow to love but about the world they exist in. Personally I never expected Garen to kill a man like he did but in that story he did and it shocked me a little. I learned more about him.\n\nThe Darius comic in the same way showed me a softer side of Darius I never expected to see. When the lore reveals more about these characters, that's when I think it's successful. When it shows me something I already know.

That is exactly the type of medium that could boost your lore to the next level. Every time that you guys do something to give even the slightest insight into the universe and expand on champion personalities, it turns out amazing. \nEven the updates to the league website itself adding more depth to the universe by adding more info on the different parts of Runeterra was an amazing touch. But still, it feels like you guys do not see the value behind exploring and pushing the lore that you guys have in place. To be quite frank, it could potentially outdo league and not need the game. That is how massive the footprint you guys have set for the lore is, but you guys aren't capitalizing on it. One thing i think you guys could do to help improve the lore, is by doing comics on a chapter basis as opposed to doing a random standalone chapter every blue moon about a champ (even though i appreciate those very much). I don't know how you guys would do it, but you guys could focus on lets say...one champ (zed) and tell their story over a series of chapters. That way you guys can properly convey all the feelings you need to, as well as develop characters and side characters properly. It would help us to feel the sense of progression each champion goes through, to feel the individual struggles they face, and to feel the joy and triumph that they feel when they overcome it.\nIf you guys do it this way, you could take your time with the pacing of each champ's story and feel. Maybe do 15-25 chapters per champion? Maybe 2 or 3 chapters a week? Idk, it can be worked out for optimal efficiency. Would love to discuss this possibility further if possible.\n\nHowever, that being said, there are a few instances where you do need to provide other mediums. Like when trying to cement a character's personality or some trait they have.  For example, the Darius animation where he is simply walking in the snow and gets surrounded by wolves, that was perfectly portrayed and done. I mean sure, you could have written about it or made a comic on it but it just wouldn't be the same, it's all about the little details that are included to instill that sense of (oh crap, Darius is alpha as hell). \n\nAnother example is where you could have included an animation. - for this, i personally feel like Kayn's little intro story where he is on the mission to acquire the Scythe on Zed's behalf. The writing for that was impeccable, i was totally immersed but it would have been astronomically better if you guys had animated that ordeal. I mean who doesn't want to see ninjas coming out of the shadows and tossing down??????????? (so badass )\n\nAnyway, i just want to say thank-you for getting back to me, i didn't actually think you guys would respond to a random post by a lore fanatic. I really appreciate it. \n\nI just got through reading some of the responses you guys made and they answer some of my questions.  I sure hope i am not missing anything.\n\nTLDR, i hope you guys put more emphasis on the providing diverse mediums to portray different things within the league universe.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DWT12345","date":"2017-10-17T23:54:16.811+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I loved all these comics, but my suggestion would be; make more comics, but for the lone wolf champions who don't have much lore, and aren't getting any vu's soon. Champions like {{champion:77}}  {{champion:35}}, {{champion:9}} or {{champion:161}}. I'd also like to see more comics with champions interacting, like the Ziggs and Jinx one. Completely crazy stuff, like {{champion:107}} and {{champion:150}} (I'm calling them RenGnar now, and there's nothing you can do about it) having an encounter with {{champion:117}}, or a comic about {{champion:28}} trying to seduce {{champion:201}} but failing because he's too wholesome.\n\nI want to to see champions from completely different regions interact, like {{champion:245}} and {{champion:26}}. I'd like to see slice of life comics for more serious champions like {{champion:86}}, and comics about the more mythical champions like {{champion:201}} and {{champion:223}}.\n\nReally the most important thing to me personally is that Runeterra feels like more than just a bunch of unrelated stories from different franchises; I want it to feel like there's more to these champions then just fighting each other in a three-lane forest.\n\n\nKeep up the good work though! I am waiting with high hopes for the next glimpse into the world of Runeterra, and I can't wait to see what you come up with next!\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-popcorn}} \n\n","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DariusDemiurge","date":"2017-10-17T20:47:41.235+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just gimme da Morgana and Kayle stuffs.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Camille Ferrøs","date":"2017-10-17T20:27:41.648+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That  is my dream A expanded League Universe.With the lore its ok but I want visuals like comics/animations or books with or without pictures.There is so much material from the whole universe that they can use..","replies":[]},{"poster":"Variks the Loyal","date":"2017-10-18T18:55:38.086+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think they'd be very well served by getting together a collection of lore books similar to Warcraft Chronicle; not stories, but pure lore about the setting and nations of Runeterra.
