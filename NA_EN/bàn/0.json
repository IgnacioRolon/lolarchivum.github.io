NA hasn't really come up with any new strats or picks, they just copy Korea. Since Korea is always on the cutting edge with strategies, they not only know how to counter the strategies they have already made, but they have the element of surprise with them when they bust out the new strats on another region.

And it’s not just an issue of personal seriousness or personal expectation. You have much diverse and powerful, positive and negative, social forces at play. For example, outside of a relatively small community, in NA and EU, telling someone you’re an eSports athlete is to have them silently judge you for not contributing in some tangible way to your society. In Asian culture, you’re more likely to receive some level of respect for most occupations, especially if you dedicate a significant amount of time and effort to reach mastery, eSports included. This is a form of positive social pressure.\n\nThen there’s also the potential personal and familial expectations that individuals of the culture are expected to meet. In many Southeastern Asian cultures (and honestly Asian cultures in general) family reigns supreme. The image you project and how it can affect your family’s reputation is huge. This could likely be a more negative form of social pressure that NA and EU teams simply don’t face.\n\nUltimately, culutural differences ensure that the stakes are always that much higher for Asian teams than NA or EU.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Smitty Manjensen","date":"2017-10-29T16:36:20.723+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know that it's because NA and EU suck, but I am still tired to see them win, especially SKT.","replies":[]}]}
