The NA server you trying to play on is located in Chicago, United States the distans between them is too far. There is nothing you can do to lower your ping, the only thing you can do is moving closer to the server, means you have to move to USA.

Is their a possibility that its a problem on the servers or something?","replies":[{"poster":"RiotBok","date":"2016-05-24T00:21:31.282+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When you're seeing consistent packet loss it's usually one of three things:\n\n*  ##**Problems within your network setup/hardware (e.g. Wireless issues, faulty router, etc.)**\nTo definitively find the cause is usually a process of elimination. If you've gone through the [Log Reader](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743)/[Connection Troubleshooting](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664) articles though, then you've already hit what we've found to be the most common causes of network connection issues.\n\n\n* ##**Failures on the game server**\nThis is usually the easiest to rule out as if the game server is losing packets, everyone in the game should be experiencing the same issue. If they're not, then it's much more likely to be one of the other two issues.\n\n\n* ##**Connection errors on the ISP side**\nUsually a result of ruling out the other two options. Can also look at doing a network analysis (We usually direct to http://netalyzr.icsi.berkeley.edu/) which will can help to determine if there's a problem in your network or a problem connecting to League specifically. If you're having packet loss on your network in general, I'd contact your ISP for troubleshooting.\n\n\n\nBit of a long explanation, but hopefully you find it useful. Tried to keep it as short and simple as I could.  If you're still getting consistent packet loss only to League, feel free to [send us a ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and we'll take a deeper look :D","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Legs","date":"2016-05-23T22:13:54.366+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have been having this problem too since Saturday.
