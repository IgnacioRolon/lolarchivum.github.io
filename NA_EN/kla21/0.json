I need one more mastery 7 token to get him to mastery 7 but I received no rating for that match not even a D- and it sucks. was it because it was my first game of the day or something im just really confused. I am 15/2/7, most kills in the game, highest gold generated, highest vision score and the game was 35:43 minutes long.\r\n\r\nRiot, Please Explain","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-09-25T06:00:55.967+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Your grade is announced in chat in the post-game lobby, but if you don't mouse over your champion's portrait to show your grade there before leaving that lobby, it doesn't get saved to your match history.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Failmageddon","date":"2019-09-25T05:57:00.931+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Highest vision score is relative.

Only the rating gets lost in the history a percentage of the time, especially if you leave the lobby quickly. If you had earned an S, then you would have received a token.\n\nNumbers look pretty good to me, though. Perhaps you received S-.\n\nI've never tried doing this, but I suppose that it is possible, that if you made a ticket or a bug report, then your grade could be retrieved. However, if it had been an S, then a token would already have been granted.\n\nAnother possibility, is that supports are disproportionately graded on a curve towards assists (not kills).","replies":[]}]}
