Yes, I know that I&#039;m a Team Builder player, which means I _rarely_ play ranked, but I still have a right to say something too, _right_?  \n\nI used to main her back in the day when one would say, \"_noob_\" or even \"_beginner_\". I used to play her through levels 14-27. Then I got really excited with {{champion:222}}, which means; bye bye {{champion:21}}! \n\nI would love to main her again, I obviously can, but there are some serious things that she should possibly have in order to make her... \"_meta_\", as someone said to me when I played her in normals, (also got flamed a **TON** for playing her)! \n\n\n____________________________________\n\n_**BEFORE you start reading this, I want you to know that I don't expect ALL these changes. That could make her overpowered... but I really wish there could be changes to her passive and maybe even her E. **_\n\n____________________________________\n\n\n_**Passive -**_ I really want to know the reason why **ANY** damage cancels her movement speed boost. I&#039;m fine when enemy champions hit me and cancel it, that&#039;s reasonable. But why make it where enemy minions, or even neutral monsters, cancel it? \n\nI can&#039;t even **count** how much times I have lost a kill or even died from minions hitting me, making my passive go **BOOM**! For a champion with no dash or escape, as someone would call it, I would expect this wouldn&#039;t be part of her  kit. This is like giving {{champion:17}}&#039;s W, {{champion:15}}&#039;s passive , or even {{champion:222}}&#039;es passive going bye bye from any **MINION** or neutral monster damage. \n\nI remember reading her \"_nerf history_\" , how before having a shield on her wouldn't cancel the movement speed if someone, or **SOMETHING**, attacked her. They _nerfed_ her where having a shield would actually cancel it, but this was long ago when League of Legends actually started from what I see. **If you can&#039;t at least bring the \"minion&#039;s won&#039;t cancel the speed\", then _pleaseeee_ consider having her passive non-cancelable if she has a shield on her. **\n\nIf she had the {{champion:86}} passive change it would be perfect! \n\n*I did find something really cool-looking a short while ago which someone suggested on doing something where every time she puts a level on her ultimate she could get benefits on how many HITS it takes to cancel the passive over a certain amount of ??? time ;\n\nLevel 1 - 1 hit \n Level 6 - 2 hits\n  Level 11 - 3 hits\n   Level 16 - 4 hits\n\n(_enemy champions cancel and 11+ neutral monsters will cancel as well_)\n\n_**Q - **_ This skill is fine to me. The damage is actually really good if you get the 2nd bounce, especially in lane. The mana cost is great too. \n\nThis spell is very _unique_ to me, and I still don't know why. :)\n\n_**W -**_ The grievous wounds are **PERFECT**... if they have a _sustain_ comp or the enemy needs a lot of healing. This skill is actually O.K. if you use your ultimate, since it will increase the stacks of magic damage done to the enemy, or even auto the _hell_ out of the enemy. \n\nInstead of 2 seconds for the grievous wounds, 2.5 or even 3 would be cool to see. Another thing that could happen is actually let it scale with the amount of levels you put into it for the duration ; \n\n**_Example_** ; 2/2.25/2.50/2.75/3 seconds\n\n_**E - **_ They did buff the slow % long ago, it&#039;s just the minor damage that bothers me. \n\n_**Logically speaking**_ - Why not make her have some **AD** ratio, since_ they&#039;re_ bullets anyway. \n\nI find this ability **COMPLETELY** useless. The damage can't even put a beat down on minions unless you go AP. The slow is a little _dissatisfying_, and sometimes I feel the cast range of pressing this button is bull!@#$. An AD ratio would help with the damage _problem_ a little, and if you can't do that then having it do something with the grievous wounds W would be **great**. \n\nNow the big problem is **on how she casts it**. I sometimes feel like it's not even worth it to press 'E' and then have this horrible animation taking place.\n\nIf this ability was ever completely removed from her kit, I don't think I would even land a {{item:3070}}.  \n\n_**R - **_ The only thing that **really **hurt {{champion:21}} was removing the **AD ratio** off of this. \n\n\"_She&#039;s a early game champion, we removed this because she isn&#039;t a late game champion and blah blah blah_\". The thing is, ADC&#039;s are late game carries that are monsters. This ultimate is really unique since it can change the tide of battle, which some ADCs can&#039;t do. \n\n**This is all!!! **\n\n**Obviously I know I can&#039;t get everything I want but I would love some buffs to be taken in place. **","replies":[{"poster":"Ixoziel","date":"2015-06-13T16:23:13.712+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":2,"body":"Yeah, taking the AD ratio off her ult ruined her. That was such a dumb change. Yes, it procs impure shots, but they do MAGiC damage. Building AD gives her magic damage, and building AP gives her physical damage. That's so backwards.

Yeah, Graves dashes and gains 70% AS at max rank.  MF passively does stacking magic damage that scales with AD and gets grievous wounds / 60% AS at max rank while active.  I'd say she's not getting screwed at all, her W is quite good as it is.\n\nHer passive just needs the Garen change.  Level 11 only large monsters and champions can cancel her passive.  It would probably be perfectly fine then.  Having it only drop on HP damage taken would be a good QoL change for her.\n\nHate her E and wouldn't be sad it if goes.  At the very least have it play into her W's stacking or something.\n\nI'd just like to see her ultimate have AD scaling again..

Remember that she also counters most ADCs including flat out overpowered ones like Kalista.\n\nI'll try to argue your points. Her passive is basically let me get to lane quicker, or to a fight to position. that's it. she doesn't have the greatest range to where her passive can stay up for long. your passive disappears for the most part in any sort of fight, unless you ult then try to go into the fight and not get any sort of focus, and minions also take out her passive. Pretty useless if you ask me. Vayne has something similar to mf's passive. Vayne gets that when running to a enemy champ which is WAY more useful and more dependable. MF's passive is garbage and VERY situational to where unless your team knows what exactly they are doing positioning wise it offers nothing to team fights. it's not a good passive period. \n\nNeeds to be adjusted considerably. \n\nHer q is pretty decent, although idk why ap ratios are on there.....  she's supposed to be AD last time i checked. but this ability also falls off, you're not going to stop using AA's and ur w to get a q off....\n\nHer w is pretty good and is a nice steroid. i don't have much problems with this ability\n\nHer e is pretty garbage for the most part. can't really use it in lane for the most part, costs so much mana for a little slow? not very useful in all stages of the game... I just don't like this ability and so do most MF players. it's not worth using. \n\nAnd for her ult, i read somewhere on the forums before where her ult actually is stupid to use later on in the game as it does little to no dmg. I don't hate her ult though, it's nice to look at. \n\nokay she runs an exact 51% winrate with a little over 5% popularity.......... that isn't really good. she's not a popular adc for quite a few reasons, and mainly it comes down to her kit is somewhat clunky and doesn't quite gel together. at least with the constraints that it has on at the moment. \n\nOverall, she needs a VU, needs her passive to be adjusted. and her E should be looked at again or changed entirely.","replies":[{"poster":"A Miss Fortune","date":"2015-06-14T16:37:04.401+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for giving a good argument, rather than people just saying something like \"LOL MF SO BAD RITO BUFF PLS GG PASSIVE SUCKS\".\n\nHer Q does fall off late game, but it also has doubled the AD Scaling by the way. \n\nHer E is so useful, you can use it to check brushes, follow up on CC, get away from chasing enemies, help push lane, and I've even used it to execute someone after I've died.

I didn't really notice any early-mid game changes with her damage but late game I could tell she falls off with her ultimate damage and sometimes even her abilities. \n\nI love her Q so much though... I find it so useful in lane and even to bounce off to a support running away with their ADC on low health. then I Q him, then POP!
