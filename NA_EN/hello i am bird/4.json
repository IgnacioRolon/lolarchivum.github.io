I&#039;m going to assume for the sake of the thread that my ranked MMR and normals MMR are somewhat in the same ball park.\r\n\r\nThis isn&#039;t going to be a thread complaining about ELO Hell, but I do want to explain that this becomes less of a problem the higher up you go. (Probably :p)\r\n\r\nI had a game recently where I was playing Darius matched up against a Lulu. Their team was obviously a 5 man premade while none of us had queued together. They were able to coordinate 4-man ganks within the first 4 minutes and got lots of kills.\r\n\r\nOf course, we all fed, and that led to some back and forth bickering from the ADC and the support. Without trying to sound like I&#039;m on a high horse (that tends to only get them more mad) I tried to tell them to mute each other.\r\n\r\nThey ignored me, and decided to keep arguing.\r\n\r\nThe enemy team was starting to fall apart. Something on their side went wrong and they started throwing. By this point it was approaching late game and we had a teamfight that almost cost us our base because our ADC &quot;Didn&#039;t want to deal with Thresh&quot;.\r\n\r\nHowever, we won the teamfight somehow, and had 4 of us up while they only had their Lee Sin, so the ADC&#039;s splitpushing worked. I TPed up and we got one of their nexus towers. Then Lulu spawned back in so we had to run, but we made progress.\r\n\r\nThe support decided he would go in 1v5 to show the ADC what&#039;s what, and he died. The ADC then decided to throw himself in and they both died. So we tried to defend an open nexus with two inhibitors down against 5 people who had now gotten baron.\r\n\r\nWe lost a perfectly winnable game because Thresh and Draven argued and decided to go against one another instead of the enemy team.\r\n\r\nI could have carried perfectly and gotten an ace, but that doesn&#039;t mean that they would follow up. Yes there were still 2 other people, but as it stood, they weren&#039;t very good at pushing or sieging. Of course I didn&#039;t perfectly carry, we were 5 solos against a premade queue, there was no way we could have, but I did turn a 25 minute game into a 40-50 minute game.\r\n\r\nThis isn&#039;t a thread saying that &quot;omg my temmates r bad i deserve challanger&quot;, because for the most part I belong where I am.\r\n\r\nI am still open to improvement, and saw a lot of stupid decisions myself that I hope to improve upon.\r\n\r\nMy point is that you cannot ignore your team mate&#039;s mistakes. It&#039;s simply impossible. I could be an amazing player but that still doesn&#039;t mean that I can carry 4 other people who are all working against me. Even one person working against us is sometimes even worse than a ragequitter, because they will actively ASSIST the enemy team past the point of making it a 4v5.\r\n\r\nI guess what I&#039;m trying to say is that you should look at your own mistakes, and don&#039;t point fingers, but sometimes, when you have a bad match, it&#039;s fine for you to realize &quot;It&#039;s not always entirely my fault&quot;.

In my promos, the enemy team also had these kind of players for 2 games. It balances out eventually.\n\nThe real underlying issue in this matter is that Draven and Thresh will never be punished for intentionally throwing. Riot literally does nothing unless the player in question always intentionally feeds. \nRiot is afraid to start banning these players because suppose they do ban an intentional feeder in the high ELOs, then low ELO player can simply point to legit misplays and demand their teammates be banned as well.

Telling your teammate how to play \"better\" (quotes because subjectivity) won't make them better. One of the hardest things for people to understand is play style. When your style doesn't match someone you play with, you have a bad time. I'm a mid/jg main and as a jungler I counter jungle a lot and expect help from mid. As a midlaner I roam a lot with my jungler. When I have a mid laner or a jungler who doesn't play similar to me, I do bad. It's because I created a dependency in my play style and you as a random will not know this. \n\nYou have to realize that you and the other team mate are in the same elo for different reasons. You both belong where you are until you prove otherwise. \n\nAnd honestly I've been from bronze to plat. Shit team mates are normal and even in plat you get them. It never gets better. Its because \"shit\" is subjective. And because of how snowbally this season is, the ability to carry individually is greater than ever. You can single handedly stomp better than ever. \n\nYou are wasting time trying to find flaws in teammates. You probably won't see them again.
