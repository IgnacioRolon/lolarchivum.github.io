The [leaverbuster](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ) system treats all leaves the same, because regardless of intent they still cause negative experiences for other players.  If you are having any issues that may be causing you to leave, let me know in detail.  I'll be happy to help!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zombiemaster","date":"2016-09-28T20:36:30.171+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"The thing about this is if someone wants to intentionally leave, it's quite easy to make it look like it was a connection issue by simply pulling the plug on the router.\n\nSimply put, all leaves are treated equally because in the end they all cause a negative impact on the remaining players in the game. That being said, Riot knows that sometimes things happen that can be out of your control, so they designed Leaverbuster with some leniency. You won't be punished for leaving/disconnecting from one or two games. You only get punished once you show a habit of leaving/disconnecting from multiple games in a short enough period of time. \n\nIf a majority of these leaves are due to connection issues (ie internet or computer problems), while at the time they may have been out of your control, what you do have control over is finding a solution before you queue up for more games. It's your responsibility to make sure that you have a stable enough internet connection to be able to play, not Riot's. If you have been having frequent connection issues, it's up to you to find a solution for it before you queue up for more games, and you can test your connection in custom games. You shouldn't be queuing up for games and just hoping that your connection doesn't fail.","replies":[]}]}
