Just had a game like this and it makes me feel so angry. Especially because I had to go against a Jinx and Bard, which can be a real pain in the ass early.\r\nWhat does Riot want us to do? They want us to win our games with teamwork, but what I&#039;m seeing is they really want us to abandon our teammates just to save our own Champs from dying. That&#039;s the opposite of teamwork, and it makes me angry that LoL is being like this. If you want Carries to get more for their effort, then perhaps instead of congratulating them based on how little times they died maybe you should do so based on how many kills they got.\r\nThis is just a rant, but I know there has to be people that agree with me. I don&#039;t need any &quot;Riot bases grading on scores people get&quot;-blah-blah-blah, I and we have all heard it hundreds of times. The fact is, Riot is superimposing the Tank meta on everyone but meanwhile actually improving on the state of the game aside from Champ nerfs/buffs (other than small tweaks which are aiming to satisfy the masses but not truly improve gameplay) has all but vanished.","replies":[{"poster":"breakordoom444","date":"2017-05-19T08:06:58.694+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"the wonderful world of league of legends.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Silly Neeko","date":"2017-05-19T07:58:46.234+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Need to know the KP, the length of both of the games, the farm of both of the games, the mastery level of both the Tristana and the adc you were going 30/6 with.......
