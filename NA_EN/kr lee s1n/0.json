A mini-Chain of Corruption. \"Bard hurls a bolt of cosmic energy that connects with the first nemy it hits, dealing magic damage and slowing.

It costs such a large amount for such a low heal, even when it's been down for 10 seconds it's only about as good as others, and you have to wait for it and you need to keep it someplace safe and you need them to walk over it and for all that you get 70 at level 1. Taric does 10 less instantly that ALSO heals himself. I mean, half the time I contemplate if it's even worth it to put a point in his heal at all. Kayle too, heals for just as much, it's instant and the MS buff lasts longer but isn't as strong.\n\nOne suggestion I remember reading was for it to heal a % of health if it's been down the full 10 seconds.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Mid0rii,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=zYt4k2eI,comment-id=000c,timestamp=2015-03-27T18:34:29.526+0000)\n>\n> Moves that simultaneously damage enemies as well as heal allies is a big no-no in the history of big no-nos\n\nI guess some people don't remember release Ezreal.\n\nW = Heal/AS buff for teammates, damage/AS Debuff for enemies.

Now the whole team immediately know who the target is, and can focus together. Something similar to that as a buff to his communication moves, like a ping unique pings \"I will place a magical journey here\" highlighting the end point with the start point as soon as he presses the button, warning allies that there is a better route when chasing or escaping. In fast paced games you just don't have time to ping these things. \n\nInfo on the shrines is unnecessary because people will learn that in time (maybe showing the timer until it's fully charged though), but special pings for his magical journey like they did for Reksai's ultimate, outside of that, it's down to the player to quick ping their intent to gank or use an ultimate.\n\nOn a side note, should players be able to customise their pings for certain commands (like hold shift for custom ping message) like maokai can ping \"I will route Nidalee in 5\" or \"run I am baiting\" for champs like reksai who knows he can escape if he is last to leave a bad engage, or \"help I've got barrier\" for champs like volibear who look like they're about to die but drop a barrier that buys time for their passive and suddenly drop an ultimate on the foolish team focusing the tank","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"KR LEE S1N","date":"2015-03-27T17:27:13.737+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for taking time to comment on my post, I didn't think it would receive this much attention haha.

We're also planning to test a little tweaking to Chime spawn locations, though that's more speculative and might be more of a feel change than a power one, not sure yet.\n\nThese are the buffs I would personally like to see: \n\n(1) **Slightly faster Meep respawn during laning**. Bard currently has an extremely low threat potential in the early laning phase (which is exacerbated by the lack of any offensive power spike when he grabs his W and E). I'm fine with him having a lower threat potential than other supports (because of his utility) but it feels a bit too low in his current state. The Meep respawn rate doesn't feel like much of an issue once laning's over, because you're able to carry multiple Meeps and skirmishes don't usually happen that quick in succession.\n\n(2) **Adjusted Meep spawn locations during laning**. I've noticed that Meeps will often spawn based on your location and position relative to the river. This has led to some very difficult Meep spawns in the first five minutes in the game, especially if I'm scouting for jungle invades. This (usually) makes me hit my first few passive levels later, which makes laning much more difficult because of how important the first few passive levels are. I've actually found myself often waiting by the T2 tower to make sure the first two Meep clusters spawn in favorable locations, which is not really helpful for my jungler and team.\n\n(3) **Adjust Bard's Q targeting slightly**. I'm not quite sure if Bard's Q is just a straight skillshot, or the second tether has some targeting algorithm (similar to Miss Fortune's Q), but I've had some occasions where I manage to tether a second target that I didn't want (usually a minion) when I thought I was aiming Bard's Q at a different target and angle. This isn't a huge issue, and doesn't happen frequently, but it's surprising and disappointing when it happens. I think his Q is fine otherwise. \n\n(4) **Adjust Bard's ult speed slightly**. I'd like Bard's ult speed to be increased just a little bit (~.25 seconds) and his ult indicator (to allies and enemies) be adjusted proportionately. I've been able to do some very interesting and exciting plays with his ult, but it currently feels a bit more unreliable than it should be, especially with its higher cooldown.\n\nThe other buffs you've mentioned (base stats, mana per chime) are nice, but I don't feel like they're much of an issue. I feel like Bard's base stats are comparable to other supports in lane (especially after runes) and I think that Bard is appropriately punished for spamming his heal in lane (he doesn't have mana issues otherwise).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wullf","date":"2015-03-27T14:09:20.588+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"quicker respawn of Meeps - great\nmana restore per chime - why not, but I dont think it is needed.\nBase stats - great if it is base HP\nRespawn place of chimes - good, it is not nice to have several chimes in enemy jungle before 5 min.\n\nBut main problem I encounter while playing him is his Q.\nIt has short range\nIt's projectile is slow\nActual width kinda seems more narrow than width of visual effect.\nAnd targeting of second target is ridiculous.

His Q needs to be more reliable. It's a very slow skillshot and very short ranged. Either the speed needs to be faster or the range needs to be longer.

Tbh i just think bard's a difficult champ to learn, and his winrate reflects that","replies":[{"poster":"IForgot2buyBoots","date":"2015-03-27T07:36:46.279+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"His damage isn't amazing, but what support's is late game?\"\n\nNidalee, Morgana, Lux, Taric, Soraka, Sona (!!!), Janna, Kayle, and Karma.

Late game, Mage supports can deal damage yes, because their MAGES who've found a place in the bot lane. Also you list Soraka, Janna, and Taric on your list of late game damage dealers? Damage is not a forte of any of those champs, and Taric's is conditional at best.\n\nSona is another territory because tbh i've always felt that Sona is too incentivized to build pure AP or mage rather than support, especially with the crazy amounts of damage and utility she gets from it. \n\nKayle support is all but dead, and Karma functions fantastically in every lane. Basically end game, support damage is suppose to taper off, unless you're playing a mage support a la Annie, Zyra, Vel Koz etc.\n\n\nIn regards to Bard, tbh the range buff on the pbe is everything i could have wanted save maybe a W buff to deal with its lackluster max heal and Excruciating mana costs,  He's really close to balanced, people just need to learn how to play and play with him, and these changes will help him be a little less risky.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wullf","date":"2015-03-27T14:14:41.431+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Janna?

Yes Nidalee, lux and Sona can have dangerously high damage for supports, while kayle and karma are limited in the sense of damage verses utility and other support mechanics. I don't think morgana's damage is amazing as a support, while Taric's damage only applies if you stand there and take it to the face, typically he is easy to work around. Bard should not be a damage dealing champ, and should be most compared to Jannah, except his CC is nowhere near as good. Give him a slight cc buff, either improve reliability of Q, or add additional mechanics to W or E (a passive on E, or an Aura from W shrines) His ultimate should not do damage, and riot is not going to go in that direction, at least not any time soon","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Nucleophilic atk","date":"2015-03-26T16:36:07.403+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea, him being recently release has absolutely nothing to do with his win rate.","replies":[{"poster":"Volt Cruelerz","date":"2015-03-26T16:50:36.343+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's still well below where one would predict when accounting for the fact that he's new.","replies":[{"poster":"R110","date":"2015-03-26T17:52:51.899+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Release Yasuo had less than 40% on release while being really overtuned with that lvl18 720 shield that lasted 2 seconds.\nSame thing with Azir, however he did have a lot of bugs that made him weaker.\nSame with Kalista.\nBeing a champ that's so different from the rest it takes a while for people to pick him up as no experience on any other champion will help you play him effectively.
