No worries about that. Playing for a long time shouldn't make the folders get much bigger, and if they do it's likely just those log files tbh. On the note of log files, they're just used for troubleshooting if needed. Its good to keep those around, but you should feel free to delete the really old one.","replies":[]}]}
