For those of you who don&#039;t know, Ivern can clear any camp on the map really quickly by insta smiting it after triggering the passive. If your careful, ward over walls to check for enemies, and are willing to burn your flash if needed to escape, you can walk away with an easy solo invade with Ivern.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m not saying I want Riot to do anything about it myself (because every time I&#039;ve done it the enemy jungler yells at me in all chat and I think it&#039;s hilarious). I&#039;m just wondering if enough people complain that Riot might add some targeted nerf like not allowing Ivern to smite in enemy jungle early game or something? Would they forcibly remove counter jungling abilities from him?","replies":[{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2016-10-31T02:12:10.746+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nobody is complaining because no one plays ivern lol.

Getting rid of his few strengths isn't a good idea.","replies":[{"poster":"NHOSMEkwL8","date":"2016-10-31T02:23:56.850+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Another downside is the way his jungling works late game.  Midgame your passive is like 20 seconds before you can get it free... most champions can nearly insta-clear camps at this point.  It's insanely hard to gank AND try to stop to touch all of your camps, THEN come back to take them. Without mobis he's pretty much useless and Riot is all about variation.","replies":[]}]}]}
