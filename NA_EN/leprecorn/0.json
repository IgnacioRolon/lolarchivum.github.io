After the first game we waited and got into champ select, but both of our games had to reconnect  during declaring and banning, however did not reconnect in time. I don't know if this is a connection issue since both of us are playing on different networks and locations. \n\nI had another problem during our 4th lobby (we played two games). The champions in the menu did not load, even after typing letters into the search bar and clicking on the role icons. I don't know if there's a problem with my client, computer, or network that caused these, but I just want to prevent getting placed into low priority queue or leaverbuster again.\n\nEdit: The second problem happened again after waiting on the 2nd low priority queue timer.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-04T01:56:44.813+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmmmmmm that bit where you mentioned that none of the champions would load screams connection issue tbh. That will happen because your client is trying to pull the data for what champs you own, but it can't grab the data so it just ends up blank. \n\nThis could most likely just be an issue with ports being closed or DNS configured weirdly. Check out this [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) for steps for how you can open the needed ports and flush your DNS settings. Test it in a custom game and let me know!","replies":[]}]}
