BC and LW have the same AD. The loss in \"armor pen\" is only 5% and you gain movement speed on every auto along with 400 health and 20% cdr. I think those 3 things make the 5% loss worth it.\n\n> you have too much attack speed it would be better if you  did more damage instead of trying to proc you passive faster because technically when the passive is up attack speed would mean nothing you would want more raw damage. I agree with BotRk maybe after IE and boots\n> \n\nThe reason for building this much attack speed is for her q active not for her passive, her q active gives an additional 35% damage on top of her regular passive and also splits into 5 with all 5 parts procing Runaans. What makes this more attractive than it would normally be is that the runaan bolts are procing Botrk passive. I recently learned that the main target will only receive a single Botrk proc per auto instead of 5.\n\nAside from that Runaans is starting to be considered core on her even for other build paths because of how well it synergizes with her q, Botrk, BC, and Static Shiv. Static Shiv procs on every auto with her q active.\n\n> I just feel you need more damage in the build less attack speed the built in AS and stack+boots+BotRk should be more than enough its not likely you will be able to build focus more than twice in a team fight if it lasts an extremely long time so going attack speed really isn't ideal there either.\n> \n\nThe build still has BT and IE and I may not have made it clear enough in my post but they would be built 4 if you don't need the BC for that team.\n\nAny fight that lasts longer than 10 seconds can make use of her q active twice. Personally, I see a lot of fights that split for a 4-5 seconds and re-engage, which means you get to use the q at the start of the fight and the end of the fight. \n\nOn top of that it also allows you to make better use of your q active.\n\n> Hurricane is good only if they are group otherwise its just a waste of and could be more useful as another AD item\n\nSince you can lifesteal off of the Botrk passive now if there is even a minion wave next to your target the bonus lifesteal you get could easily turn a fight.\n\n\nPersonally I think her q is better to make your build around than her passive. But I also just like how she turns into a machine gun.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Venowolf","date":"2015-04-30T19:54:49.917+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{item:3153}} {{item:3085}} {{item:3006}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3071}} and maybe {{item:3046}} or {{item:3087}}  \n\nI think that is the best build on her, I need to know what is the amount of atk spd that she reachs with that built.","replies":[{"poster":"LongHair Fox","date":"2015-04-30T20:02:31.979+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Statikk shiv would be better than phantom dancer since with her q active its passive will be applied on every aa.","replies":[{"poster":"Venowolf","date":"2015-04-30T20:12:43.898+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"With Runnan Hurricane she launch 10 arrows by flurry atack so can be work well, the problem is if she reach the 2.5 at spd cap.","replies":[{"poster":"LongHair Fox","date":"2015-04-30T21:34:53.932+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IIRC she currently needs 230% attack speed from runes and masteries for her to reach the cap.
