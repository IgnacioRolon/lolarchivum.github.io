The 20% was an arbitrary amount and it could differ between the cost types.\r\nIt would build into 3 or more different items, ad, ap, health, others?\r\n\r\nThis item would be an alternative/ addition for champions with resource hungry abilities.\r\nmy main reason for applying this to resources other than mana is shen, his dash costs over half of his energy which basically means he is only allowed to engage in bursts when he has full energy, instead of a sustained fight","replies":[{"poster":"The Paulrus","date":"2015-01-18T20:48:01.583+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Most of the supports have abilities that damage enemies, which is good.  What shouldn't happen are situations like a Sona who's able to continually heal her ADC and give them a speed boost.  If you wanted an overall mana cost reduction, you'd have to provide some type of increase to CDR to prevent spamming.  With 40% CDR and a refund on even part of mana costs, would many ranged supports to spam their abilities ad nauseam.  \n\nAs for Tanks, Hextech Sweeper is another option for mana, albeit not a great one.  Riot definitely needs to improve itemization for tanks and in general.   The key problem you run into, like I mentioned, is people who get to 40% CDR, and would no longer mana gated effectively, and would spamming abilities like mad.  For example a TF who can spam his three card throw every 3.6 seconds because the cost reduction makes it so that he's able to sustain that mana.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Paulrus","date":"2015-01-18T20:19:38.679+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would argue that rather than a cost reduction, a mana-vamp for casters similar to what {{item:3508}} does would be ideal and effectively the same as a cost reduction without removing the initial mana-gating effect.  It would also prevent spam healing and spam of utility spells.  You could easily work in the stacking mechanic if needbe, but I think it would have to be similiar to a Mejal's stacking system, where dying loses you stacks.  In fact, I'd argue there needs to be a CD or some type of gating on the ability to prevent massive spamming of abilities.\n\n> Unique Passive: Mana-Vamp: Damaging an enemy champion with an ability refunds 1% of the mana cost of that ability is returned to the champion for every 50 damage the ability does.  Bonus is halved for AOE abilities.  Cooldown: 5 seconds\n\nA few options with the stacking:\n\n> Unique Passive: Spell Charge: Damaging an enemy champion with an ability grants a stack of Spell Charge. (Cannot occur more than twice in 8 seconds.)  Max of 50 stacks.  Half of stacks are lost upon death.\n> Unique Active: Mana-Vamp: Damaging an enemy champion with an ability refunds 1% of the mana cost for each stack of Spell Charge for 15 seconds.  Spells cast while Mana-vamp is active do not grant Spell Charge.

A true support has their first 2-3 items decided for them before the game starts and tanks only have one item that can help them with mana{{item:3110}} .\nI think there should be more itemization options.

I don't think it should apply to non-mana-using abilities, and I dunno about a stacking system or if it should just be an immediate effect, but it does provide another way for mana sustain to scale, which I think might be interesting.","replies":[{"poster":"UberAffe","date":"2015-01-18T19:31:38.729+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm assuming what you didn't like was it building into those different item types/ being used for non-mana champions\nI wanted the build paths because right now there is one mana \"regen\" item that is not ap {{item:3508}} and I think it would be nice to have a build option for all non-ap champions that have mana problems\n\nAs for opening it up to other resources that was mostly a whim addition because I think shens costs are too high","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-01-18T12:27:31.558+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bonus energy in Masteries was removed because of champions abusing it.
