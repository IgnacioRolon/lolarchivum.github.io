I know that Tryndamere is supposed to survive the ult, but not that Urgot&#039;s ult goes off on it&#039;s own just because &#039;Tryndamere would have died&#039;.\r\n\r\n1. Play as Urgot against a Tryndamere\r\n2. When Tryndamere is extremly low, have Tryndamere use his ult\r\n3. Ult him as Urgot, do not reactivate it\r\n4. Damage Tryndamere until he would have died from fatal damage (which will be prevented by his own ultimate)\r\n5. Urgot&#039;s ult will automaticly activate and pull him in with the chains, regardless of the duration that&#039;s left, making it impossible to keep the drill on him and ult right around the time he would become vulnerable again (The &#039;killing&#039; damage from the drill itself will also reactivate it on it&#039;s own)\r\n\r\nKinda simple to reproduce, it happend the whole match when I went up against a Tryndamere. I wanted to ult him and keep the drill in, to execute him shortly before his ult duration is over, but well... the game kept automaticly chaining him in for no reason.","replies":[{"poster":"TheLastShadow45","date":"2017-09-22T21:39:15.088+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Sadly it's not a bug. {{champion:6}} doesn't care about {{champion:23}} ult duration and will still try to \"kill\" the person. The only check it cares about is the hp left.","replies":[{"poster":"Sharld","date":"2017-09-22T21:44:12.060+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wrong, Urgot's ult states that at the end of the duration, if it can execute, he will automaticaly do so. However, if you Ult a Tryndamere after he started his ult and fell to like 10 HP, you will hit him and INSTANTLY pull him towards you, without any imput from the player. I mean instantly as in, instantly, not after the 4 seconds. It seems to me that the ultimate thinks it's target is dead, so in order to go on cooldown, it 'uses' itself, thus pulling tryndamere in, when in reality it should wait for the 4 second or a recast to do so.","replies":[{"poster":"megadethfish","date":"2018-03-16T17:34:05.813+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll confirm this. Been maining him for a while and its a really annoying bug because you could just spear him with the ult after he's halfway through the duration of his, then when it runs out reactivate. I wonder if they put this in place due to the ease of that interaction. Idk, I still see it as a glaring bug. \n\nHave you seen the Braum shield bug though? A full hp Braum can jump with his shield after Urgot re-activates his ult and Braum will take the chain to execute instead which can litterally 100% -0% him lol","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Riot Porosite","date":"2018-04-16T02:12:42.184+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bumping this bug/unique behavior because the behavior seems counter to the ability's general mechanics. For all other 100% damage reduction abilities like Kayle and Taric Ult as well as Guardian Angel's revive, reactivating Urgot's ult while they are 'unkillable' means you displace them, but fail to execute them.\n\nThe behavior on Tryndamere is unique in that Urgot's ult reactivation trigger is automatic rather than manual or timed as with all other champion and item interactions. In addition the displacement that happens with other champions doesn't stick, and Tryndamere instead rubber-bands back to his starting location. This means that the displacement utility is removed as well as the ability to delay the ability reactivation or waiting for the ult reactivation timer to time out on its own.","replies":[{"poster":"Sawtrack","date":"2018-09-23T21:41:57.816+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bump! This interraction has to be fixed! I want to use my ult on an undying trydamere to keep distance and finish after! NO PULL HIM TOWARD ME TO KILL ME!!!","replies":[]}]}]}
