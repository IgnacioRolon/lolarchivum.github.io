To save my allies last moment from teamfights, fighting along side them as I desperatly try to keep everyone alive, slowly pressing forward to the enemy nexus, collecting champions to add to my collection and staying up late at night to learn everything I could possibly about them from their abilities, to their cooldowns to even their lore. I found players, a community, friends to share my passion with. \n\nThis is quite possibly the greatest community I&#039;ve had the pleasure to be a part of and this is a game I will always look back fondly off and I want to keep it like that but there&#039;s a problem, the game feels like it is in shambles, jungle is ruined, ADCs cry out as the botlane slowly becomes more and more obsolite to the game, more and more damage is added as towers are made paper thin, the game feels rushed with tanks and glasscannon seemingly standing on a hill of the skeletal remains of champions that cant survive in this new meta. the runes have taken away the identity of players, blue essence the spoils of war as the game feels unrewarded. and the community cries out. it begs for answer in the one place where we hope for answers, but in return we find nothing. \n\nEDIT: most of this was writen as a massive rant after noticing the mass amount of players in the gameplay section being bascially ignored. yes, Meddler is doing well with his posts, answering various questions of the playerbase but I feel like more Riot members should be active in the actual gameplay section or otherwise, more Rioters should hang around Meddlers post answering the various questions people have. Either way this is somewhat of a minor complaint written mainly out of frustation so dont pay all too much attention to it","replies":[{"poster":"aimlesswarrior","date":"2018-06-10T17:40:14.824+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would lloooooove to see a riot video / community qa / or 4 hour podcast responding to the current state of the game. seems like 90% of youtube videos and most of the top boards posts are how horrible the current game play is.","replies":[{"poster":"the Anarchit3cht","date":"2018-07-07T06:39:28.153+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"A very loud minority is still a minority.

Bar them doing something exceptionally amazing, I wouldn't have a reason to complain. My continuing playing is proof enough that I think the game is in an ok state. If it wasn't, I wouldn't play.

This is especially true in regards to inquiries about supports and Sona in particular.  I've seen Meddler openly ignore some 13+ questions about Sona within a single blog post, for several blog posts in a row.  It's not even like they were from the same person or asking the same question, it ranged from gameplay to in-game models to lore to posts directly asking him \"Why are you ignoring literally every single question about Sona?\"\n\nUnfortunately, certain topics are taboo for Rito & Meddler to discuss.

The decisions that are made certainly might not be widely shared as to their reasoning behind it, but don't mistake that lack of visibility as blatant ignorance of the question. There are many good reasons why we might choose to not share a change, or maybe we don't address it cause we ourselves know its highly experimental (all these things are guesses, not actual cases). Do I think we could be more visible with patch and balance notes? Sure, the answer is always yes. Do I think its the *best* use of time to type a 100 page paper on game balance as it increases exponentially with each new champ? No. Our time is better spent working on the game rather than spending thousands of hours explaining ourselves. A fine line has to be walked, but the sad thing is in that line communication does suffer :S\n\nI'd also like to say, I've literally sat it multiple hour long meetings all talking about how to help supports. However, the role is tricky and we also don't want to pigeon hole the players into one specific style of play or engagement. Hence the creation of Pyke and Rakan and other \"styles of support\". Its just that with supports the stick looks different than for other roles, its more subtle, less obvious, and more... supportive in nature. The question is how to promote and celebrate that support.","replies":[{"poster":"Emmy Cha0s","date":"2018-07-23T23:01:31.629+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That doesn't excuse knowingly leaving Sona as an unbalancable, unplayable, literal dumpster fire since Patch 4.13 went Live, when she could have been reverted as soon as it was apparent the entirety of the \"rework\" was a total failure.  Players have concluded that the entire patch was a sum of 35+ simultaneous nerfs to her, multiple shadow nerfs & probably making her the most-nerfed character in the game, with far more nerfs within that singular patch than any other character has received in all their patch history.  Despite this, she hasn't seen a single buff since & why would she?  She's never received a buff in the entire history of the game.\n\nWhen Rito decided Ahri's 5.1 rework was a failure, they reverted her.  They reverted Rengar.  They added Shurelia's back into the game.  Rito is FINALLY getting over their unjustified arrogance of refusing to revert failures.  It's 4 years overdue to revert Sona or just Sion her, because fact is: patch 6.14 just made things even worse.  Pronouncing her design flaws 10-fold instead of trying to fix even a single.  Fucking.  One.\n\n---\n\nIt's one thing to say your time is better spent acting than just speaking, but Rito isn't acting.  So that point is moot.  It's also another thing for a Ritoer to go OUT OF THEIR WAY  and spend that precious time you seem to value very highly, to publicly lie about a character's viability, much the way Meddler, Jag & Fearless to name a few off-hand have done on multiple occasions apiece.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"CaptainAntiHeroz","date":"2018-07-10T23:10:56.128+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Bazerka,realm=NA,application-id=6heBIhQc,discussion-id=UVhPQ69A,comment-id=00010001000000000000,timestamp=2018-07-10T22:23:00.738+0000)\n>\n> Ah unfortunate :(, tbh I&#x27;m not sure if thats a good way to get a dev blog question answered?
