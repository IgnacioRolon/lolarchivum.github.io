It would be more logical to save that archetype to build the world more rather than using a character already in their creative ecosystem.

The only current candidate with only a title and not a name is The Ruined King, at least that I can think of. And they should consider at least *some* side characters that can be fleshed out as champions. For example, wasn't Jarvan originally a side character in Garen's lore and then became a new champion? Also, not quite the same situation, but Graves was kind of created as a side character to Twisted Fate.","replies":[]}]}]}
