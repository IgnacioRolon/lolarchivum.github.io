We're also replacing the IP grind with a revamped rewards system that levels up with you.","url":"http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/preseason-update?utm_source=LeagueClient&utm_medium=OverviewTier1","image":"https://lolstatic-a.akamaihd.net/frontpage/apps/prod/preseason-2018/en_US/56b279af397e909179993541dfbd5cc038a339c1/assets/img/meta/share_1024x1024.jpg"},"up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"So one thing I'm curious about is if the skin boost on ARAM is going to stay the same. They're changing how much Blue essence is worth comparatively to RP. So will it stay that you can pay 100 RP for a skin boost and get 200 Blue essence (100 for your teammates)?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-26T04:49:33.481+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not actually entirely sure about this to be quite honest!
