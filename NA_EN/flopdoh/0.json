Also people get kicked out of champion select because you can't have two of the same champions on the same team for ARAM, furthermore say I own two champions {{champion:266}} and {{champion:103}} that is a 50/50 chance to get either one, not really random is it?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-05T04:16:02.248+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is working as intended.
