You're addressing the enemy frustration by making the plants irrelevant but without acknowledging the existing frustration to Zyra players.

In solo lane, they can spawn behind tower, on the sides of lanes, and even in jungle camps. None of those seed spawns are helpful when laning. Additionally, against assassins, it's really important that the seeds be clustered closer to zyra...it's how she survives. Unreliable passive spawns are problematic when you make changes that rely precisely on that mechanic.","replies":[]},{"poster":"hi hi its zy zy","date":"2017-05-17T23:15:17.102+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"i don't really think you play zyra if you think this is a good idea lol. you almost never want multiple plants because they do reduced damage when there's more than one of them attacking a target. you typically only want more plants when you're going for an all in with your ult or a gank after you land the snare. having the plants die in one hit means that they will at best get two autos off and in most cases just one... \nzyra being a support also means that she'll almost never reach level 16 to begin with to make up for these nerfs, and it's still not a lategame buff because you removed the scaling health on her w that allowed her to reach 6 plant health. the only buff present is the spawn rate being higher, but who cares if you can spawn two plants at a time when it takes an auto from each enemy laner to effectively destroy ur only source of relevance or damage in lane phase until you hit 6, at which point the lane phase is almost over anyway and you've been completely incapable of doing what zyra does: bully, because the rework shoehorned all of her relevance into plants that will now die in a single auto attack during the most crucial part of the game for zyra, the part where she builds a lead and rolls with it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vekkna","date":"2017-05-17T22:25:32.523+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=20thCenturyFaux,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=lwbYeTWi,comment-id=000500010000,timestamp=2017-05-17T21:49:27.073+0000)\n>\n> In no particular order: \n> \n> The R plant Health bonus applies to all plants once R is learned. \n\nThe screen cap of the new tooltip wasn't clear, but most of my concern was based on the belief that the health bonus was not a full-time passive effect.\n\nJust to make sure I understand, that means we break even with plant health on live at level 6, and it's a buff from level 11-18? If that's the case, it's actually a pretty nice buff at 16.\n\n> Q mana cost is something we&#x27;ve got our eye on, that&#x27;s decently likely to change.

Could see this being a good place to buff solo lane Zyra since plant duration in lane would mainly benefit minion control. \n\nCould the zoning issue be mitigated with a tether range? If plants near Zyra (say 1100 units) lasted longer, it would help her carry dps in extended fights and let you hit her afk zoning harder if needed.\n\n> Higher plant damage comes from there being more when they spawn. W seeds are placed at times where the opponent is under the highest pressure, and so least able to attack, making Health less important for them. \n\nIf plant hp is back to live values at level 6, my complaint is irrelevant. You said you're wanting to keep her power level consistent with live. I do think this is a pretty big nerf to her early poke, but a ton more seeds and double-spawns overall sounds like a large buff to mid/late game and objective control.

Any character with a D.O.T such as Hecarim W, Amumu W, Singed Q etc, pop plants instantly already which feels really crappy. These plants do not move and are stationary so they should be a lot more durable than getting 1 auto in lane since you can get out of their range.\n\nRegarding more damage through her passive spawning, that passive is really useless except for helping your jungler level 1 with his buff. These plants never ever spawn in a suitable place and honestly this \"passive\" should have been slapped on her W. You claim to be giving more \"damage\" through her passive spawning seeds but these are honestly just frustration factors for the Zyra (speeds never spawn in places you'd want them) and the enemy (randomly getting two seeds on you just because of luck).\n\nI honestly think this is going to take away enjoyment from Zyra, yes she is frustrating to play against but so are many champions out there.

If this goes through to live she will be a complete liabilty to pick into any kind of shield or healing support will sustain their adc through the poke and the pressure you are putting out will be offset by the fact your feeding them 10-15 gold every time you try to harass them. \n\nUltimately I feel that If you really want to make this change work I think you need to look at the amount of gold offered up to the enemy adc for almost free by plants. either removing it or reducing it to 2-3 gold, they gave 5 gold before her rework when they were 10 second duration 6 hp tick pains in the ass, if they are going to die to a single autoattack 5 gold is way too much of a reward,  at least until you get the first point in ultimate.\n\nFinally, while what I have to say about your reasoning may be negative thank you for taking the time to explain to us where your coming from, and I'm assuming if your reading this listening to our feedback.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LankPants","date":"2017-05-17T23:33:29.361+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":">So what do we buy?

I feel like with where this is headed Zyra is being set up for failure in mid lane. See the overarching problem with whats happening is she is having power pulled from certain areas and further put into her RNG passive. This is the core problem i think that is happening. The randomness of her passive is what makes her so mindless and while I think that having more plants is awesome, I would much rather have more control of where those plants are going then just have them randomly dropped. I think a better change would be to instead give her more seed charges. So she can have like 5 seeds or something with her w could even have W charges scale with ranks in w. I dont think shifting power into her RNG mechanic is healthy for her in terms of playing her and playing against her. \nPlease don't ruin Zyra... If you wanna lower her plant health and let her spawn more.... Let her have control of where she spawns those plants... through W. This adds a skill implement and gives her much needed power in mid lane and still achieves the goals you guys are looking for.","replies":[{"poster":"Penta Ace","date":"2017-05-21T21:11:46.311+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would have liked to see riot move her into the opposite direction from what they are doing now.

I understand her support may be strong but further nerfs to mid lane is unneeded.I see this creating more issues than what it solves.

Literally no one is asking for her rng seeds to pop out faster, im not sure why this is even a change. \n\nI whole-heartedly agree with the ult changes though, because her ulted plants are supposed to be super versions of her regular ones but they die just as fast.

Platinum {{champion:143}} here. So i've been testing these new changes Zyra is getting and this is definitely NOT what she needs. At this point there is nothing unique about her as she's just a \"plant\" champion that spits out random seeds and summons 2 boring default plants. The health reduction to her plants is a terrible idea as they are dropping the moment they are spawned and only get a maximum of 1-2 attacks out. Yeah sure maybe more frequently if the enemy doesn't have any aoe or lots of attack speed but that's none of my business...\n\nThere is no benefit to having seeds spawn faster if you have her Q & E' mana cost, costing an arm and a leg and once a plant(s) are even summoned, they're gone almost instantly, so i just wasted 70 mana for nothing and no damage. As I said again, clearly basing this champion around her minion plants and seeds is becoming too much of a struggle - so why not just have zyra have abilities based off of lashing vines, vine whips, a column of thorns, just something poison ivy'esc and call it a day.\n\nBUT since a whole new champion update would most likely not happen since theres other projects in the works... I would either have her passives radius be reduced so seeds spawn closer or just give her W more seed charges. Revert the plants health. Give grasping roots a VISUAL UPDATE and heck, why not make her interact with the plants in summoners rift and make her summon new ones?\n\n**PBE**\nhttp://imgur.com/NpLAp57\n_(Passive info should be moved to the top in my opinion)_\n\nhttp://imgur.com/pCbyvhz\n_(Receieve?
