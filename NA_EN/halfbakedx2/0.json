This is coming from someone who is pretty much broke and loves to spend his time on this game. if anything i would at least like my money refunded to me that i sunk in over the last however many years ive been playing this game. I would much rather prefer my account though.

That game involving the Malphite wasn't even the game that got Dunkey banned (as confirmed by Riot Lyte himself in an ask.fm [question](https://ask.fm/RiotLyte/answers/132485638338). That means that just like OP in this thread, Dunkey had multiple infractions that led up to his ban. It wasn't even a permaban, it was a 14-day ban at that.\n\nEveryone that consistently shows highly toxic behavior at some point will receive punishment. It may not always immediately escalate like you want it to, but it happens. And the people that intentionally troll don't bother making forum posts because they realize their behavior warranted punishment. It's players like OP and Dunkey that think verbal abuse is okay that make threads and videos about how \"it's just words\" and \"we shouldn't be banned over a little tough talk\". If Malphite was a one-time offender, then he likely faced a smaller punishment such as chat restriction and his next offense would've escalated to a 14-day ban.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Riot Tantram","date":"2016-03-08T23:37:49.419+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":3,"body":"There wasn't a Malphite in the games taken into account for Dunkey's punishment.\n\nPeople are very rarely punished for a single game, but if they are it's for extreme cases. If a player has a single off game, they likely won't be punished. If a player shows a history of being toxic, they will very likely be punished. The cases you are talking about where people exhibiting like behavior and only one being punished is a manifestation of this.
