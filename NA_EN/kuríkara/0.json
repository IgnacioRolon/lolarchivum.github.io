Is it a bug? Has anyone else had this?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-06T16:53:38.058+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm, while we can't see when a demotion may occur I don't see a streak of losses either.  I recommend posting this over at our [bug report boards](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report) for our QA team to look into.
