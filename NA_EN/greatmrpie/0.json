They don&#039;t tent to kill as much, this is even more emphasized for the tank picks, and they&#039;re job is to keep the acd alive and dealing damage. This is all fine I&#039;m not writing about how they need a buff (they do, its just not the topic). This topic is about how after making great places ending a tank support at 3/1/32 and getting an S+ I left with one honor (the ADC).\nThis is because with no damage and no kills honors end up going to the acd who you kept safe leaving you in the end feeling unappreciated. This is because its nature to honor the adc who got the kills and not see that player who is frantically keeping everyone alive. My request is to give honor to the support just for picking support. Support is a bad pick and sometimes you end up with feeling helpless. If your adc runs in and dies and you have no power or damage with out the adc, or if the adc quiets you cant manage. All in all pick support is an honorable pick and should be rewarded as such just for picking it.\nThank you for reading this.","replies":[{"poster":"Pinkaj","date":"2018-03-23T04:08:59.093+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's kind of unfair...this is coming from a support main as well. If people ONLY honored the support, then top (who may have been the initiator of the fight, and got the team the ace for the win), the jungler (who may have given good ganks to those in need), the mid laner (who may have roamed very well to get a double kill while your lane was getting ganked), and the ADC (who maybe healed just in time to save you from an enemy ult) would feel just as unappreciated. Some people don't care about others, some do. It is nice to get honors for being a great support, however others deserve some love for their efforts as well, so long as they weren't a toxic teammate.","replies":[]}]}
