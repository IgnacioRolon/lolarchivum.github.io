Not sure if Riot is dodging the question.\r\n\r\nHere&#039;s what I&#039;m talking about: compare the [splash](https://i.imgur.com/KWbtbk4.png) and icon {{champion:203}}  with their [model](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-QRYhCRpjUKg/VfiJg2Tl_BI/AAAAAAAAGjM/rNOTfN8nOSU/s640/kindred.jpg). In all official 2D art, Wolf has the white lamb ears on his mask along with the horns. However only the horns are present in the model.\r\n\r\nI think without the ears, it doesn&#039;t look like a lamb mask. Also I understand that sometimes champion modelling is difficult due to tech limitations, but then why have the ears in the art? Some official Riot feedback on this would be much appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Noctius28","date":"2015-10-14T14:51:42.977+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am way more interested in why the model has real white teeth instead of the ripped black ones from the splash","replies":[{"poster":"WereSloth","date":"2015-10-14T15:30:22.167+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Noctius28,realm=EUW,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=FoELfW3R,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-10-14T14:51:42.977+0000)\n>\n> I am way more interested in why the model has real white teeth instead of the ripped black ones from the splash\n\nI was wondering the same thing but it's a bit more obvious that it was changed for visual clarity.

People have made fanart with and without the ears, but the official art has always remained with them. I think this might be due to miscommunication between splash and model teams. \n\nBut why they ignore these constructive criticism questions on their Q&A to instead answer how much Kindred would get along with Bard or whoever, I don't know.","replies":[{"poster":"SpecterVonBaren","date":"2015-10-14T19:44:16.193+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-q7VmbYBQ5aI/Ve9md1c73JI/AAAAAAAAxBc/S4yY19pF2ug/s640/white.jpg\n\nSee? When they initially released the teaser for Lamb and Wolf with their masks appearing sometimes when you died, the Lamb mask had no ears.
