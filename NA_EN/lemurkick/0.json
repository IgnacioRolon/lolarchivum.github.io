Is there a specific name for it?\n\nHey EliteKat,\n\nSorry for the super late reply, I've been away from the boards writing like crazy for a while. \n\nI am not aware of any particular name for the style of music featured in the video. I guess that it falls under the umbrella of \"game music\", which, I realize, doesn't help you at all. It's not really choir music as people traditionally describe it, it could almost be a (albeit very short) violin concerto.\n\nThanks for listening!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"bushy eyebrows","date":"2016-02-18T01:40:35.718+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":5,"body":"too bad his gameplay isn't as good as his music","replies":[{"poster":"Zenithir","date":"2016-02-18T02:42:21.741+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Despite the fact that his gameplay is a bit underwhelming and inconsistent in general, when you DO get to pull off his kit it's incredibly satisfying and leaves the enemy with few ways to answer. Personally I think the point of mastery for Jhin is to play well enough to reduce that inconsistency.\n\nI personally like how cerebral his playstyle is, and when he snowballs he can deal with most threats to him by himself. There's nothing funnier than seeing someone like master yi get kited by a jhin who invested in a little attack speed.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DorkunedAuras","date":"2016-02-18T04:22:25.494+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My personal favorite from you is the Rek'Sai theme.
