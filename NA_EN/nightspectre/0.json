If that doesn't work then you can try clearing your cache/cookies, or even try a different browser. LAST ATTEMPT, if all of those fail, try going into incognito mode and sign in from there. \n\nYou can reach out to me if none of those steps work for you!","replies":[{"poster":"NightSpectre","date":"2017-11-08T03:07:32.628+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yep..none of them work. Tried safari, chrome, firefox. Incognito mode too for chrome. Cleared cache and cookies. I submitted a ticket to support without logging in asking about this but i don't have a response yet.
