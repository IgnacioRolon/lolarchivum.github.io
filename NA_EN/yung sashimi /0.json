So I'm pretty much SOL on it. But I don't understand how 1 game will get you a chat restriction, I will admit I did flame and I admit to it I was an A-Hole but still.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-08T04:18:27.139+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If all you have is a 10 game chat restriction, then play out those games without being toxic before the season ends and you'll still get your rewards.
