Ive turned my internet on and off a few times, restarted my client and restarted my laptop but it keeps asking me to rejoin the game when i log back in even though the game was a few hours ago and is finished by now. Anyone know anything else i could try to fix the problem ?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-12T16:58:56.166+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It looks some like players are experiencing ghost games per a response on the[ EUW H&S](http://boards.eune.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support-en/jg1u6stz-cant-reconnect-to-the-game?comment=000f).  This can occur if the end of the match can't communicate to our servers that it's finished.  Usually relogging can force that update, otherwise you may need to wait a bit for that communication to go through.
