She gets some execute ability since she has low base damage, and Zed doesn't get to blow everyone up in mid since the mana regen nerf.\n\n^^  That was J/K.  But seriously, it needs to be reworked.  You can't use it in laning phase because cs-ing minions disables it, and in teamfights you only get your first crit guaranteed, and it takes a long time to build up to the next one.  Seriously, Focus at max level is 8 stacks per second.  So at 50% crit chance, you need 50 stacks to reach 100.  That is 6.25 seconds without AA during a teamfight to get a second crit on her passive at max level.  Mid game with 40% crit chance and 6 Focus stacks, it would take 10 seconds of not AA to get a second crit from her passive. You have to cs in lane, so it is worthless there most of the time as well.  \n\nMeanwhile Caitlyn gets \"Every 8/7/6 basic attacks, Caitlyn will fire a headshot dealing 150% damage to a champion or 250% damage to a minion.\" Plus a snare and a jump to escape.  Caitlyn is definitely not OP from this, and Ashe could some work to be viable on this level, too.  I think Riot can do better and give her passive some love.
