To confirm if you're seeing general network packet loss, you can run a network analysis (Can use [this one ](http://netalyzr.icsi.berkeley.edu/)listed on our support site).  If that's the case, then you'd need to reach out to your ISP for troubleshooting.\n\nLet me know!","replies":[{"poster":"Oksanaandjoy","date":"2016-05-25T02:51:59.254+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for that. The log analyser was really helpful. I'm getting the exact symptoms described in the article.  \n\nI have been working with support recently because I was having an issue with the launcher not... well, launching. Support seemed to think I was experiencing a lot of packet loss. I've been trying to work with my ISP but it's been less than successful. I have never had any trouble with the game before and then all of a sudden, 6.9 and boom, drama. \n\nSo I found a work around and got the game running again. Then a week later I got the issue described above. When I look back at the logs from last night, you can see the slow improvement of the packet loss in one game. It was happening at the same rate at the beginning of the game and then a get a nice curve where they reduce to nothing. The game after that everything is back to normal. Weird. I hope its all working fine now!","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"L3gend4ryAspect","date":"2016-05-25T02:34:35.695+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The same thing has happened to me too.. :C\n\nExcept every time for me when it freezes the game crashes mid game!","replies":[]}]}
