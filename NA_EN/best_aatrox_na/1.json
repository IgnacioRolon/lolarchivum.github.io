IF THIS IS A SUCCESS I'LL REMAKE IT AND FORM MORE BALANCED TEAMS BASED ON HOW WELL PLAYERS AND TEACHERS PERFORMED.\n\nIt doesn&#039;t matter if you are xXWukong360Elite, or the next Bjergsen, feel free to sign up, just put your IGN below.\n\nIf everything goes according to plan and there is an appropriate pool of different elos, bronze-silver won&#039;t be mentors and diamond+ won&#039;t be students.\n\nI&#039;ll try to make it so the person you are being taught by is at least 2 divisions above you.\n\nEx. Gold teaches bronze, plat teaches silver, diamond teaches gold.\n\nOnce I figure this all out and I give you a partner, the higher elo player will watch the lower elo player&#039;s game and evaluate how they&#039;re playing.\n\nYou can voice chat if you want or just type everything out as the game goes on and send it to them, really doesn&#039;t matter.\n\nThe lower elo player doesn&#039;t get to pick and choose what game gets spectated, it&#039;s just randomly selected as to avoid coincidental good play.","replies":[]}
