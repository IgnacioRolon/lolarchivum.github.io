How often do you see mage junglers not using cinderhulk.\n\nAs for warrior, it wouldn't really hurt to revert the incredibly overwhelming 5 ad nerf. It's not much of a change and it will help a little.\n\nI pretty much exclusively build devourer, so hear me out on this.\n\nWhen season 5 came, the lee sins and the vi players and the rek'sais, etc. were all excited, I'm sure.\nThere were even some hooplah's coming from tank junglers with juggernaut and now cinderhulk.\nBut in a little corner you can see  aatrox, hec, skarner, udyr, kayle, xin, udyr, etc. crying in a corner. ( Exception of Warwick 4.20) \n\nNow while I'm not sure this is the way to go about changing devourer, but what was really wrong with starting out with 40 damage on hit?\nIt didn't give you extra damage on your ad scaling like warrior.\nIt didn't offer tankyness like juggernaut.\nWhen was the last time you saw someone legitimately build devourer and do well?\nEDIT: Exception of ad jungle fizz meta ^^^^^^^\nDevourer is for attack speed reliant champions, who generally do better off later in the game. Champions who build devourer should be trying to farm and get stronger so they can win the late game, not be forced into risky stat gains on ganks.\n\nSeason 5 introduced DoT heavy jungle items, which isn't what these types of champions want.\nThese champions want reliable stats that give them raw power in terms of clearing the jungle and fighting champions.\n\nWhat I'm suggesting is, and I know a lot of people are going to hate me for this, another jungle item path, seperate from the machete line.\n\nMaybe something along the lines of a knife or something that would be like the hunter's machete from late season 4, which upgrades into something like madreds and then something like wriggles.\n\nAlso make it so that they can purchase items from the machete line (excluding the full on upgrades) so these current devourer users can also have different options like sustain (trailblazer) counterjungling (poacher's knife) and dueling (skirmisher's). These types of champions generally don't want poacher's knife. but it can still be an option.\n\nWhat this introduction of raw stat scaling like a feral flare would re-introduce is junglers not only being aware of the enemy laners, but the enemy jungler as well. This would make champions like  shaco and lee sin  become strong again due to powerful counterjungling options to limit these feral flare champions.\n\nThese feral flare champions should be shitty early. That's what they're for. But these champions can also deal with cinderhulk later due to the magic/hybrid damage their jungle item offers, so cinderhulk users have to itemize more carefully.\nThe game should really turn into Feral Flare>Cinderhulk>Warrior>Feral Flare\nThis would introduce more champion diversity throughout the game, and more thinking in champion select.\nRaw damage would also give completely random champions who shouldn't be in the jungle a chance to jungle, which would give really creative options.\n\nOn a side note, feral flarers would still be a little weak, so it would be nice if riot could also reduce the respawn time of jungle camps a little. Maybe between what it was in season 4 and what it is now.\n\nTL;DR Give devourer users raw damage options like feral flare to introduce a healthy champion selection pool for the jungle, and reduce jungle spawn times.","replies":[]}
