Thanks for the ticket number!  It looks like based on your specific issue, you have a new ticket number to proceed with your issue.  Be sure to check out your most recent specialist response for details on that.  Best of luck!","replies":[{"poster":"Last Executioner","date":"2017-08-03T17:18:43.797+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you so much!","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-08-02T16:21:12.027+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Blitzbot isn't human, but it may relay questions to help prep you until an account specialist gets to you.  If you have a ticket number, I'd be happy to check on the status.  Just keep in mind that if you keep spamming responses, you may drop to the bottom of the queue, delaying a specialist reaching out to you.","replies":[]}]}
