This nerf imo is really stupid, because instead of lowering her damage and her burst, u lower her q early game which is fine but at higher ranks its not lowered at all, and ult stealth duration which isn&#039;t even a problem, it will just reduce her playmaking. Why not just reduce Q dmg by 15% at ALL ranks and reduce the AD she gets from her ult, or simply make her Q bonus unable to crit. The current nerf is a tone down in power for sure, but she will still be two shotting people and her stupid damage is still there, it just makes her easier and more straight down to play. IMO it&#039;s a really stupid way to nerf her, she definetely needs a good nerf but to her damage, not to stealth duration.

It's called making their weaknesses more prominent. When they buff, they buff things that are already key strengths of the champion, when they nerf, they nerf key weaknesses. \n\nIn this nerf, they're targeting her early game, an obvious historical weakness, and her safety, which has also always been a significant weakness of her's, (though people talk about it less). In the late game, if she wants to teamfight and flex her very high damage output she has to put herself at risk of being locked down and exploded since she has no way to extend her damage beyond her auto range. With the changes to pink wards, her stealth was far too powerful of a defensive tool. It's appropriate to nerf her two key weaknesses, early game and safety.\n\nAs a side note, the larger change in her ability to damage squishies in the mid game was in maxing q first. Something the koreans have been doing for a long time, but was uncommon in the west because everyone was so enamored with her true damage (which was late game strength due to it's % damage), and only switched over to after the buffs to her q.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Not Surrendering","date":"2016-11-23T02:25:33.473+0000","up_votes":32,"down_votes":12,"body":"Nerf hitting PBE tomorrow will be targeting the top end burst and also making her lane slightly softer.","replies":[{"poster":"Oglaf","date":"2016-11-23T11:50:50.688+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":12,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Fizz Enthusiast,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=7AQpuOA2,comment-id=000e,timestamp=2016-11-23T02:25:33.473+0000)\n>\n> Nerf hitting PBE tomorrow will be targeting the top end burst and also making her lane slightly softer.\n\nHow, exactly?
