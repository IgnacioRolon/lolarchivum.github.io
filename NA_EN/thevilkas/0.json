Once the bundle is no longer available, neither will the icon. Without the icon, the border won't be available..\", so I just wanted to know if I obtain the skin without buying the first Star Edition and get icon from the hextech loot(if possible) would I automatically get the border? And does that go for every other skin like Project and etc? Thanks","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-23T00:18:41.996+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Those borders are, in fact, typically tied to the icon that goes with it. The border is applied just by having the icon on your account, so it doesn't matter when/how/what order you get them. If you buy the skin first and get the icon somehow later, you'll have the border. If you get the skin now and the icon isn't available from chests or for purchase, you won't ever be able to get it again.","replies":[]}]}
