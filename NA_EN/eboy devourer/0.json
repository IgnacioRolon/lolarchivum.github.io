I hope it's not a case of reporting a lot makes you have a lower report priority or something, because I never false report. I have a troll or a toxic flamer in almost every game, and I just feel like no one ever gets punished. It would just be nice to get validation from a Riot employee that they are actually reviewing the reports I send. Just because I report people often doesn't mean that the reports shouldn't count.","replies":[{"poster":"Duchu26","date":"2017-08-11T15:14:45.392+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Apparently reports have no \"weight\" anymore:\n\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/1vUGoiuQ-riot-report-weigth-does-it-exist-or-not","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sarutobi","date":"2017-08-11T11:51:36.804+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because that's not how the IFS works. You will only get the message if your report was the last one before the person was punished. So for all you know your report did help in getting someone punished, but someone else might have reported them after you and thus they would have gotten the notice. For me personally i think its stupid to have it work that way. I believe anyone who reported someone no matter how long it took. If they end up getting punished everyone who help report should get some sort of notice. I believe they gave some BS excuse of not wanting to be a bother to people who report and getting loads of notices, but if that's the case just make an option to opt in or out of getting the notice through the options menu. It wouldn't be that difficult to implement. \n\nBut sadly this is what we have to work with. Not knowing if out reports are getting through and because of that people get that falsehood that its not working so they have no reason to report people who break the rules. Which in turn makes them not report and letting people who break the rules go free. Its sad and not something i would want if i made this type of game.","replies":[{"poster":"Duchu26","date":"2017-08-11T15:17:08.730+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, they probably should change it, to show the players their reports mean something.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ada Wong","date":"2017-08-11T10:55:34.058+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sometimes I Get them but I really don't like having to report people although this morning I reported 4 toxic idiots.\n\nFirst Game of the day, JG keeps running into lane after being asked to stop and muting / turning off pings all together refuses to stop causes the game to easily be thrown by tilting it hard.\n\nSecond Game, again people don't respect the role assignment so whatever I play it anyways, and our jungler keeps coming into lane after being asked to stop and flat out griefing the lane phase, I don't care if their score was like 20/5 either or whatever the fact they were told to stop, upset me as a player very much and caused me to have to leave and roam flat out is a report worthy offense IMO.\n\nOn top of that game their buddy who was likely duo started talking shit in chat.\n\nI am very sick of these type of players when I encounter them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-08-11T06:13:24.127+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its fairly random whether you get the message or not.
