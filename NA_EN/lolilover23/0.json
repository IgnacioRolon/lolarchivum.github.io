Every time I try to open League of Legends, it shows the logo for a few seconds, but then tells me that lol_launcher has quit unexpectedly. I've tried deleting the file, but it doesn't help. I have reinstalled League multiple times, and restarted my computer, but none of that has done anything. Also, I tried replacing my User Kernel, but it hasn't solved the problem. Every thread I've checked hasn't helped me so please help me fix it.","replies":[{"poster":"Urworstfiend","date":"2014-08-28T00:01:47.005+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Really, now I have to get 20$ so I can play, dammit","replies":[{"poster":"LoliLover23","date":"2014-08-28T04:51:56.338+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Really, now I have to get 20$ so I can play, dammit\n\nIf you look in the App Store, you can update to 10.9 Mavericks for free.
