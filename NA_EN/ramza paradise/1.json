I get my role 7/10 games I play, so if I was any good, I could carry myself, say for me, to gold, if I made few mistakes in 5 or 6/7 of the seven games I got, and probably win 1-2 of the other games, and that isn't going to  make you a better mid laner, or adc, or jungler.\n\nI suck at adc, because I normally play people like olaf, aatrox, or hecarim, where their role, is to kill the enemy carries as fast as possible regardless of opposition, so when I go into a game as adc, I am not used to kiting, I am used to charging, I am not used to not being able to take one skill shot of damage, you simply aren't used to what the said role entails, yes you will pick up on things as time goes on, but are still not going to be any good is most of your games if you are facing someone that plays that role normally.\n\nMe, my awareness of where to be at a given time is shit. If dragon is up, I try to stay at bot side, and that is about as far as my ability as a jungler goes, and the one mid laner I can play reliably is Karthus, because I am only an okay viktor for elo -- at best, so I end up picking karth basically every time I have to go mid, because he is the one mid I understand to a level where he is playable at my elo.\n\nI think people should at least have a small pool of champions for each role, but to expect someone to be proficient at every role?

Ive been climbing my way out of elo hell and even though i almost never get my main(top) through playing ranked ive been learning how to improve on my other roles cus im forced to play where i normally never go. Whoever says dont play ranked cus you cant do certain roles i say screw them because playing where everyone is trying thwir best to win really helps you see where you stand and how to be better.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Passionlip","date":"2015-08-30T20:13:01.444+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The best plan is to not main anything.\nJust suck at all the roles, then you will find balance in all lanes. {{champion:98}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Amelie","date":"2015-08-30T00:26:10.691+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't mind people who excel at certain roles, but I think everyone should at least be able to play support at a basic level.

People who say that are just being stupid.  \n\nThere are two ways to be on average a plat level player.  Be plat skilled at all roles equally and therefore have the same chance to win regardless of role, or be high plat skilled at one or two roles, enough to make up for the difference of the losses when you get stuck in other roles (which will happen infrequently enough to maintain rank).  Whether they realize it or not, most players are much better at some roles than others.
