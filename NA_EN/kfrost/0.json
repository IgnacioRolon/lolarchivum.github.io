Except I know without a doubt I told Avast NOT to block it. I can look into Avast and I see that I have various League of Legends exceptions already, I honestly wouldn't know what to add to the list. I've tried deleting the launcher folder, which has worked for me in the past as well as a couple other methods that I've seen suggested to no avail. I want to say Avast is the issue here.

I was able to log in this morning successfully, it patched and I logged in but since logging out I cannot get back in.  When I double click on the program (lol.launcher.exe) the league of legends splash screen logo pops up for a second and then disappears the cursor spins for a few more seconds and then nothing.  There does not appear to be anything left running in the task manager.
