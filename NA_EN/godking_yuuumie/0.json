It's not fun waiting ten minutes for a game, its not fun to play a role u don't really want. I'd rather play support, because really, it isn't that bad.\n\nThe thing is that your little dream where every role is equally important and fun is basically impossible. If you look at every single comptetive pvp game with different classes, some are always better than others. In wow pvp, some roles are shit and others are broken, same for For honor, Dota, star craft, literally every single pvp game with classes or different factions ever. That's not a solution, because it's impossible.\n\nSupport will always be less popular unless its a really strong class, becuase it's a utility class, not a power class. Most players want to have massive health bars or see other players healthbars melt thanks to their own plays. Just using {{item:2065}} to speed somebody up to melt another player isn't quite as exciting. However, unless you're suggesting completely overhauling the core design of supports, which would not only piss off those who do like to support, and probably just break the game because of how impossible it would be to get the new designs working, you have to choose one of them.\n\nAnd regardless of what you may feel like, riot has stated that a majority of players prefer autofill to longer queue times. If  it was the other way around, they'd just give us increased queue times. Riot doesn't win by pissing us off, believe it or not. Now, you have two options: Leave the game or adapt. Or, I guess I lied since there is a third option: Continue to be a dick head and ruin the game for 4 players because you don't like to play the game you're playing.","replies":[{"poster":"Bjørnetjenesten","date":"2018-11-11T21:13:33.012+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"Changing or removing the support role is the wisest move here. Probably gonna piss a few players off, but majority wouldn't care at all (+80%). They just want to do damage and carry, why do you think champions like {{champion:143}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:555}} are so popular? \n\nRito has changed entire champion classes, rune/mastery system, the map, towers, dragons, baron, plants, herald and everything in between. _\"~~Deleting~~ Overhauling\"_ a class wouldn't really be a problem, sure some crybabies but its for the overall health of the game. It would be a net positive. \n\n\nKeep in mind that support was not considered a role in the early days and they can with some effort go back to this concept.

Firstly, Support isn't a shitty role at all, since plenty of people do like being supportive players. Sure, perhaps not hte majority, but more than you seem to think. That's why pretty much every single role playing game ever has had a healing class. Because some people like to heal and help their allies. Duh\n\n Secondly, its needed for the balance of the game. If you remove supports and replace it with another role, you won't just affect that, you'll affect adc's too, which have most of the early game power, which would then impact the entire pace of the game. Supports exist because adc's are weak and vulnerable early, they need to hold a supports hand so they don't get lost at the mall early game. If you remove that and replace it with another jungler, what happens to adc's? Weak early game adc's like sivir will just get completely dominated by the likes of draven without the help of a support. More over, waht would be the role of an adc? Both \"bot-side\" junglers would just constantly hug bot side, since the adc's are super weak and vulnerable, thus making them prime gank targets, which would also force the bot side junglers to constantly be around bot side to guard it, which would just make them supports with extra steps added. What's your fix to that, not make adc's weak early game? Okay, then what is the point of lucian, draven and mf, who are supposed to be early game adc's? What is the difference between an adc and a mage at that point, except one deals magic damage and one deals physical damage? Also, if you make them strong early, they can't be as strong late because you can't have a role being too good at too many things, so what then? If adc isn't the late game role, then which is? What about the players who want to play for late game?\n\nDid you even concider any of these things?\n\nAnd that's not even counting in that doing this would probably just kill the fucking game. Doing this would make it completely unrecognizeable as league of legends except that the characters are the same. The flow of hte game would be completely different, the porpuse and strenghts of roles, how lanes are played, map rotations, everything would just get scrambled into hell and even pro players who spend their lives learning this shit would have a hard time adapting to it, much less casuals who just play a few games every now again for fun.\n\nChanging runes, dragons and barons is one thing. They have all remained the same at the bottom level. Runes enhance your character in different ways beyond just your in-game items. You can kill dragon or baron for some kind of reward that has changed every now and again. Towers has had a few nerfs and buffs but nothing more than first tower bonus. Which, like herald, isn't changing or removing something, its adding something new. And no, Riot has never fucking ever changed a class to the degree you're suggesting. They have made some small general changes to assassins for example, but every assassin remained an assassin after the assassin rework. Those who didn't was nerfed back into assassins promplty. Certain toxic or bad champions have been reworked, but never a bunch at the same time. For good reason.\n\nThe first one I've already mentioned. It would be so hard to adapt to new things. It can take a month for the community to get adjusted to just a single new character, maybe even more. Imagine around 20 champions being completely changed. It'd be fucking insane. And, how the fuck do you expect riot to be able to balance all of it? THey can barely manage to design one new balanced champion. Camille and Ornn both took months to find a place in the meta where they weren't completely broken or useless, imagine them doing that to 20 champions in a completely new role that had never existed before.\n\nDo you see the fucking problem?\n\nAnd the biggest part of it is that support isn't even a toxic or badly designed part of the game. Like i've said, every single class-based game ever has had some sort of a supporting role or character. Because SOME PEOPLE JUST LIKE DOING THAT. Would you be okay with jsut flat out removing assassins from the game? Cuz A lot of people utterly hate them, but they're needed for the game to exist in some state (though, I do admit that they are currently a bit too bursty with nothing else to them). Or, how about early game bullies, huh? I find them toxic and frustrating to play against. They frankly ruin my games. So lets just remove every single early game champion because I find them annoying.\n\nNo, you mongaloid, lets not that do. I'll be the first to admit that there are problems with support, just like every god damned role, but just flat out removing them would be bonkers. Don't rip shit out of the game that people like, fix it.","replies":[{"poster":"Bjørnetjenesten","date":"2018-11-11T23:51:53.500+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Stop being so triggered lol, i said remove or change the **role**, aka move them to the jungle or something else.

Okay, tell me, how do you suggest Janna exist as both a shielding support with almost no cc or damage as well as a jungler? Or Lulu? Soraka? Should shielding/healing supports just not exist? If you think that, you're wrong. I like them. I want them in my game. So, what then is your solution for shielding supports? How the fuck would you design them to be both junglers and be what they are now? Because the thing is, they're not a toxic part of the game. They aren't making it unfun to play, so what justification do you have to do that to them?\n\nThat goes for your whole argument, you haven't actually established that support is a bad role, just that auto fill is a bad system. Well, I get auto filled onto jungle just as much as support, and I don't like jungle that much either. Therefor, we must ~~remove~~ change the whole fucking role into something completely diffrently because I personally don't want to spend maybe two hours of my life learning how to play it. Instead, all the players who have spent hundreds upon hours in the jungle should lose their favorite role and have to play as a second top support instead, abandoning all they've learned and what they actually like to play.\n\nBecause I don't like auto fill, right?\n\nDo you just not know that some people actually like playing support? Does that concept not make sense to you? Around 15-25% of people are playing support at any given time, do you think pissing off circa a fifth of the player base would go well? And that's assuming everybody else in all the other roles would love it, which is probably not true. Adcs would probably be pretty upset, as would junglers.\n\nAlso, it would not bring in old players and I can tell you why: They don't like change. Half of them stopped playing because it wasn't the same game as before. I've had old friends jump into the game after like five years, and I've had to explain to them that you can't buy dorans ring as your first support item and shit, to which they said it's bullshit, it was better when they played and they promptly stopped playing again.\n\n\nAnd lastly, you never actually gave a reason for why this all would be a good idea, except \"turning it on its head\". If that's what you want, we could make mid a second jungler, or adc. You just gave a few reasons for why it would be okay, which none of are true. It would take more than a few months to get this all balanced dude, this isn't a single champion rework, this is a twenty champion rework. THis isn't like the mage changes, where they essentially just gave one new ability to a few guys and fucked around with their numbers. Which, btw, then took several months to fix it all into a balanced state. I don't think you understand how unbalanced this new system would be, because Riot just would not be able to fix and balance 20 new champions in a role that nobody had any experience with in a completely new fucking game within a few months and expecting them to be able to is jsut ridicules.\n\nAnd that's assuming we only need to fix champions, and only support champions. You suggest overhauling the entire jungle, which is something that has demanded an entire preseason in the past. Now, just adding in a few new monsters and changing teh dragon reward is one thing. Splitting it into two completely different jungles where two junglers just keep to their own side would just be... that times a thousand millions. And, what about adcs. Look at draven, his design is based around needing a support to lock people down so he can kill them. Same goes for Mf, really. If you just move every single support like you insanely suggests, you're probably looking at upwards of 30, if not more, champions that are fine right now but for some reason will be changed completely. \n\n\nJust because you don't want to spend a few games playing support? Your justification for all of this is that you don't want to play support like once every ten games? \n\nlol.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"fattybob","date":"2018-11-11T17:34:09.171+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The best is when they refuse to dodge.
