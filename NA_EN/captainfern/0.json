I haven't even played the tutorial yet, and that's not a very good first impression. I get this is a f2p game, but from it being one of the most popular games in the world, I'd expect it to not crash due to it's own files. I have a link to the original discussion I was getting support from with Broporo, but when I followed Broporo's advice, it brought up an even larger error, and I tried to get Broporo's help again. He did not return. I also have a ticket to support that hasn't been noticed by anyone. Please, if you want to help me, stick around, because I don't want another Broporo incident.\r\n\r\nMy ticket: [](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/31911478)","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-25T20:51:07.374+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry that it felt like I was ignoring you, I actually kind of freaked when you mentioned that!

However, I reinstalled LoL to get the client back, and I haven't closed the League window since. I clicked launch, and it actually worked! I want to know how to fix it in case it happens again, so I might close it and test it the guidance they give me.\n\nTotally forgive you for not responding!

If you want, we can move this to my ticket, because I'll be posting the .zip from the HexTool there.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-25T22:22:46.221+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We'll start handling this in your ticket, since that should be much quicker and more efficient!
