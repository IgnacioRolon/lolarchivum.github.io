Generally, what you're looking for in a broken champion is something that's bad for game health even when it's balanced.  You're also looking for champions that ignore fundamental principles of the game design.  \n\nFor example, {{champion:45}} is broken because long range instant stun into 100-0 combo affords no meaningful counterplay -- either it kills you and Veigar is good, or it doesn't and Veigar sucks.  So long as the play pattern remains the same, this mechanic is broken regardless of what the numbers are.  Riot chooses to leave the numbers too low to be a competitive pick, because broken UP is less bad for the game than broken OP.\n\n> Hell, what champs aren't \"fundamentally broken\" when you just look at their kits in a vaccuum?  \n\nAbout 90% of them.  Most of the time people misuse the term \"broken\" and apply it to things like {{champion:236}}.  That's just an overtuned champion, meaning his numbers were too big to be balanced but making them smaller would result in him being good for the game.\n\n> I hear a ton about broken mechanics but I haven't heard one thing about a universally recognized healthy champ.\n\nI don't think you can get universal agreement on anything.  That's just the nature of people.\n\nHere are some paragons of health to consider: {{champion:99}} {{champion:110}} {{champion:267}}","replies":[{"poster":"2pudge1cup","date":"2014-12-06T02:04:34.204+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"I found it amusing that the post right above yours has veigar and udyr as healthy champs.\n\nBut I still disagree about 90% of the pool and including veigar in that 10%.

From your list, I would label the following as broken:\n{{champion:28}} - Her design was made in the era of invisible pink wards and now her stealth mechanic is no longer compatible with the modern vision mechanics.\n{{champion:78}} - Her ultimate breaks the rules of teamfighting and towers.\n\n\"Toxic\" means \"creates more anti-fun than fun in the game\".  {{champion:53}} is an example of a toxic champion.  There's nothing unhealthy about his design, but the way he tosses hook after hook after hook, and how the counterplay is to dodge all of them, it creates bad feels for many players.\n\nAs a rule, any champion that draws a lot of bans without being that strong is probably toxic.  Somewhere around 1/4 to 1/3 of the cast is toxic.\n\n> I really think that \"healthy\" champs are in the minority and tend to be lower mobility picks like the paragons of health you described.\n\nHere are some examples of healthy mobile champions:\n{{champion:103}} {{champion:42}} {{champion:79}} {{champion:59}}\n\nThere are tons more, to be clear, just wanted to get a bit concrete.
