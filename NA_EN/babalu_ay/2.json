I clicked it for a minute straight and it kept saying failed to reconnect. Then I restarted the client came back and the same thing happened. Eventually I got put back in the home screen because my team probably did a remake just to find a leave buster pop up and now I have to wait 9 minutes for my next 10 games. Thing is ranked was disabled on NA because of a bug causing players to disconnect randomly. The sign of the bug existing went away so I went into a ranked game and I couldn't get in???? \r\nCan I please get this leaver buster removed.","replies":[{"poster":"BaBalu Ay","date":"2016-10-06T20:16:50.339+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The game i'm in right now keeps crashing and I can't get in the game.

This is a big reason why all disconnections are treated equally by the system and why penalties cannot be modified or removed.\n\nI wasn't able to find any record of a server issue causing disconnections during the time you posted this. Most disconnections are caused by local settings on your network that cause a poor connection to the server. I strongly recommend working through the steps within our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) as the first step in troubleshooting this.\n\nLet me know if those steps caused any change.","replies":[]}]}
