This bug causes my client to get a dim black fog over it and doesn't allow me to click anything. I have tried uninstalling and re downloading the game multiple times just so the bug can continue. This bug started ever since the new client was launched and I haven't played league for about 3 to 4 weeks or possibly more because of this bug. Assistance would be appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"BaBalu Ay","date":"2016-12-01T22:50:58.697+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I tried this and my problem still hasn't changed the black fog still inhabits my client screen when I first launch league","replies":[]},{"poster":"BaBalu Ay","date":"2016-12-01T01:56:00.872+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"when I got into notepad i don't see any words at all so how do i change league client optin to no","replies":[]},{"poster":"BaBalu Ay","date":"2016-12-01T01:55:05.301+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://gyazo.com/8b2a06e2ea42c24d5702591581dcdabe\n\nhere is a link to the bug that I am currently dealing with","replies":[]},{"poster":"gononono64","date":"2016-11-30T11:59:01.390+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This will allow you to load old client instead of the new one\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGo to install directory \nEx: \"C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\"\nGo to Rads -> system \n\nOpen: user.cfg in notepad\nChange \"leagueClientOptIn = yes\" to \n-------------- \"leagueClientOptIn = no\"\n\nGo back to install directory\nRight click on \"lol.launcher.exe\"\nCreate shortcut\nClick and drag onto desktop\n\nDouble Click shortcut to open old client\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-30T02:57:48.089+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm..
