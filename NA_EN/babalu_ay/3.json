When i came back into the game, everyone was around level 12 to 13. The problem I have is how can i control if Verizon decides to disconnect on me. I barely ever disconnect and I never just afk and rage quit a game, literally NEVER.  This rarely happens to me and now i have to wait 20 minutes for my next 5 matches? That's about an hour just to play one match which will most likely be more then 30 minutes. I have to do that for 5 matches when I got randomly disconnected. Not just from League but from my internet in generalal. I can't control when my connection disconnects and this rarely ever happens so why am i getting punished? I don't deserve it. \n\nAlso my team won the game that i got disconnected from. I even told them i'm sorry and i got randomly disconnected because of Verizon. They told me it was fine and everything's ok that i got disconnected. So i contributed at the end and we won. There is no need to punish me. Is it possible this punishment can be removed?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-09T02:52:17.110+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"*OrneryPossum* is on the right track, regardless of the reason for a disconnection, the fact remains that your absence negatively impacts everyone in the match. This is a big reason why the Leaverbuster system treats all disconnections equally and why we are unable to remove any penalties associated with the Leaverbuster system for any reason.\n\nI should also mention that the 5-game penalty can never be added to your account as a result of a single disconnection. We understand that sometimes emergencies happen, which is why it takes a *recent trend of disconnections* to happen on your account before you see this penalty. You can find more on this system inside our [**Leaverbuster FAQ**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ). Let me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}
