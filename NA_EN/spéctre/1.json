The frames are getting very bad and at times are pretty much un-playable. Every other game works fine such as Arma 3 with around 90fps and Rainbow Six with around 250fps+.

I have a GTX 1080 ti. That processor is only clocked at 3.3 ghrtz which isn't amazing and I've noticed my framerates range from 200 to 70 depending on how heavily the processor is being bottle necked because its only running on 2 cores and those cores are clocked low.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-02T21:38:24.003+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It looks like you've hit most of the typical steps we use to help fix [**FPS Issues**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting)).
