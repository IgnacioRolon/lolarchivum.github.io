Whenever I am in champ select and about to load into the match, my PC goes entirely slow motion until it shows the league loading screen. Anything I am watching or sounds I can hear slow down as well. My keyboard lights, mouse, and motherboard all slow down too. Once it does that, then it is fine. Only when loading into the game it is a problem. Anything have any ideas? =)\n\nThis only happens in league btw.","replies":[{"poster":"Son of Ornn","date":"2017-05-28T02:04:59.246+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's a new one. o_o\nBecause of the mouse and keyboard lights slowing down it sounds like it may be a hardware problem. Perhaps you have a lot of processes open, potentially ones you don't know about, that're slowing down your computer.\n\nI do suggest following [**these steps**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting#wq10) to defrag your hard drive just to see if that helps as well. But otherwise, you should send a ticket in to our Tech team [**over here**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to have them take a closer look. They may have some fixes or know how to find some details that can lead to a better solution! :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"Clementine","date":"2017-05-28T01:29:30.687+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same problem here my broso","replies":[]}]}
