Sure the critical strike build is better for people that rely more on right clicks but the Lethality is not much far behind it. Before I go any further I want to show you what made me think of this so you can see my side.\r\n\r\nI was playing Rumble today in the mid lane and I was laning vs a Jayce.  After Jayce used most of his kit and missed me, he transformed to melee form then comboed me from there and as I had little hp, he finished me off with right clicks. As I was dead watching my team play, I was watching a Syndra vs Varus middle and a similar scenario happened again. They both used most of their moves and when was all said and done Varus right clicked her down and killed her.\r\n\r\nSo what does this mean to me? To me AD Assassins are supposed to have a similar role to Mages as in their play style is supposed to sit back cast a few spells that usually combo into each other and burst people down but the thing is if you pick some one like Varus and opt for this Lethality assassin type build and be able to burst then right click you down with some what of ease but Mages in the game don&#039;t get to have the same privilege. Its not like Magic pen works on basic attacks is what I am saying but Lethality or Armor Pen does.\r\n\r\nHere is my proposal. What if League of Legends tries out two different types armor penetration. One being called Armor Pen and the other being Lethality.  The difference would be that Armor penetration would work on basic attacks or moves like Eareal Q that apply on hit effects to where as Lethality would work on Abilities such as Varus q or Missfortune ultimate.\r\n\r\nThen I thought you would just build all lethality then percent armor penetration and be able to achieve the same thing. Well what if building Lethality would make you do less basic attack damage vs Champions and then building Armor Pen would make you&#039;re abilities do less vs Champions too?  There for if you built mostly Lethality then got Armor Penetration I wouldn&#039;t be as efficient because building the armor pen would hurt your abilities and building lethality would hurt you&#039;re ability to right click.\r\n\r\nThen I thought well then some champions like Rengar and them wouldn&#039;t hurt as hard because they need some right clicks to be able to finish you off because their bases are not as high as mages. Well if we tweaked their bases to fit more of a Mage feel then it wouldn&#039;t be as bad right?\r\n\r\nWas just a thought don&#039;t be to harsh on me. Let me know what the community thinks and if you think it is a stupid Idea just leave a comment as to why or what it is that makes it a bad idea.","replies":[{"poster":"NiamhNyx","date":"2017-02-11T09:02:53.903+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"HA, its a sex thing.","replies":[{"poster":"KoggyStyle","date":"2017-02-12T03:12:47.385+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:420}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-02-11T11:23:56.230+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I kinda like the idea.
