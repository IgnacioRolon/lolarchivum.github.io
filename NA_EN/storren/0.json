Is it possible to lower the emote timer or just make it possible for only allies to see the mastery emote? Its just very frustrating every like 10 or 15 seconds you hear that sound and see the emote. Don&#039;t get me wrong I think it adds more flare to league but if it could be less spamable or only visible to allies I feel it would help a lot because how the mastery emote is just abused over and over again just feels toxic and puts players in a bad mood at least most of them. To me, when its used in the games current state it feels like &quot;Haha fucker suck my dick I killed your ass&quot; no matter if they are winning or losing just puts you on tilt hard, at least for me I don&#039;t know how every one else feels but still. It just makes me feel like I am playing with a bunch of 5 year olds when something very interesting and kind of fun just gets constantly abused and used in ways that make the game feel toxic.\r\n\r\nLet me know what you guys think.\r\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"TheHappyReaperz","date":"2017-01-24T06:42:30.212+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's about perspective really. You can think they are using it because they are assholes, or you can just think, \"Wow they must be seriously insecure to continuously flash mastery.\" :)","replies":[{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-01-24T09:06:41.926+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When I'm playing jungle I always ask my teammates to tell me if anybody flashes mastery emotes so I can camp.
