I'd like to reroll some champion shards and try to get them, but I want to make sure not to do so until they've been added to the list...

We usually ask to wait at least a day before trying because they don't become available right away, as you mentioned.  Give it a go to, but keep in mind you still have Sejuani locked so it's possible that you'll unlock her.  I'm offended on behalf of our poro riding hero.  :P","replies":[]}]}
