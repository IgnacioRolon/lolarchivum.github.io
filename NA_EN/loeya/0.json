The kass on my team said he was in promos, someone please dodge. I thought they were going to dodge but they didn't. So once the game started I AFK'd so it would be a remake and the kass wouldn't lose his promos. \r\n\r\nYou can ask him for proof, I'm not his friend and I told him at the end in champ select I afk'd for him. It's not really fair that I get low priority queue just because 2 guys chose to be scum bags for NO REASON. I'm still learning adc but I know I'm definitely above average when it comes to laning from my years of support main.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-08-29T16:46:52.325+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"What happened during champ select sounds pretty hectic.  :/  Selecting not to participate, though, to try and trigger a remake is not a great idea.  Your best bet is to keep playing and perform as best as you can, because sometimes things will pan out and end up okay regardless of the drama beforehand.  \n\nBe sure to use the reporting tool after the game so we can review these cases, and make sure you're not contributing to those negative experiences via retaliation!","replies":[{"poster":"LOEYA","date":"2017-08-30T02:06:51.890+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The last time I afk'd in a game was a century ago. I don't think it should stack up like this. It should have reset to 5 minutes. I didn't actually say anything negative in champ select, or in game. Only in the end screen when it was all said and done because they should know how low of human beings they are.\n\nedit: waiting these 20 minute queues is pure cancer by the way. holy shit.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Atom Knight","date":"2017-08-29T11:46:26.715+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You griefed enjoy your punishment","replies":[{"poster":"LOEYA","date":"2017-08-30T02:09:35.916+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I griefed?
