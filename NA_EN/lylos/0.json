For example, I see a match about 2 days ago that might have slowed you down and is a cause for concern.  You'll want to stay consistent here, but you can also hit up our pb team anytime in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) for context or guidance.","replies":[{"poster":"ca√ßador","date":"2017-11-17T21:11:20.973+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"but what about addressing the fact this player received a message saying honor level 1, yet still displays zero ? is that a bug. \nI've also had the same thing happen to me.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-11-17T21:21:57.865+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's possible to return to 0 again if there are future behavioral occurrences.

You haven't been level 1 since October and dropped again after  your most recent set of restrictions.  It's impossible to say how many games or honor it will take you because everyone is different.  Some players are able to recover quickly, and others have games where they cause negative experiences and slow down again. \n\nI understand that you want to gain your honor level up, but I encourage you to reconsider how you're going about this and reflect more on how you can offer others a more positive experience.","replies":[{"poster":"Lylos","date":"2017-11-17T22:36:55.673+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honor resets after the season starts so I'll just wait until then.
