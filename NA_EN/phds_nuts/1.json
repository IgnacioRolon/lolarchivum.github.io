I played several games lag free as normal, queued up another and have had 150-300 ping ever since, and the game will freeze for .25 - .5 seconds.  Apparently I have at least 8% packet loss.\n\nI'm on campus internet in Kansas(so I don't control the modem or anything), don't stream, and live alone.  Nothing has changed with my firewall.

It seems like you might have a weak connection reaching the game server which is causing these lag spikes and packet loss.  It's hard to say if this might be result of being on campus or routing, but we can dig a little deeper to find out.

I remember it saying after the scan that it created a log file on my desktop, but there isn't anything there.  Could it have been created somewhere else?  Or should I run it again?\n\nEdit: The folder appeared after reopening the HRT, and then disappeared after the scan completed.\n\nEdit2: I managed to copy the folder during a new scan, so that's all set.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-30T16:51:46.639+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Indeed, you will find a Zip folder named \"LoL Logs\" which will contain those files.
