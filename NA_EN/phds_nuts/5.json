His role at blizz was: _My team handles everything from mechanics to items to trade skills to achievements to UI design. _\n\nKey word here is \"mechanics\". Basically he was responsible for where the game was headed in terms of complexity and difficulty. So after he was hired you saw Blizzard changing their design philosophy to \"mass appeal\" and \"casualization\". Basically they thought they could draw in more players by the means of radical simplification. The game become dumbed down and easier to get into at the cost of immersion and skill expression, viz any moron can now learn a spec's rotation in 5 minutes whereas before it took a much longer time to perfect your rotation. Catch-up mechanics are too abundant and the game is generally far too easy. Obviously this radical simplification affected PvP and destroyed the balance completely. The reason for this is that PvP was largely ignored when making these changes. There is now a complete void existing in the place of skill expression. The game is much less satisying to play than in its earlier days. As a result WoW saw a massive drop in subscriptions. In Legion it has recovered somewhat, but it's still not where it was at the peak of Wrath.\n\nCan you give GC all the blame for where the game is now? Obviously not, but he did (seemingly) support radical simplification.
