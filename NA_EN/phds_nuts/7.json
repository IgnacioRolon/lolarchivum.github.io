In fact, I'd say that most of the time they are worse. The thing is, mage-supports have potential to carry, even though its difficult to snowball hard enough to do so. For that fact alone, people are willing to take the high-risk, high-reward option because it puts the win condition in their hands instead of relying too hard on your team. \n\nBut actually look at the winrates. The Sion support is an anomoly, but after that the current list goes: Sona, Janna, Blitz, Soraka, Taric, Lulu, Leona. In fact, Janna is probably the most consistent - always at around a 52-53% winrate, almost always within the top-4 supports you can pick. People just dont like playing her since youre basically an add-on champion - you dont really do anything for yourself, but you make your ADC twice as strong. With a good ADC, it works, but making a bad ADC twice as strong doesnt give you much influence in the game.","replies":[{"poster":"DepressedAhri","date":"2017-03-05T13:02:21.453+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've 100-0'ed, solo killed, an enemy ADC before, as support Nami.
