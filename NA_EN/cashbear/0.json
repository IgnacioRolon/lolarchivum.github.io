Computer freezes about 18 minutes into every other game, it puts the computer into a screenshot-like state, simalalrly described from other players. I cannot navigate to task manager, because the league application is forced to front, I even dual monitored and could not actively click on the task manager in the other screen during the crash.\nStuff I have tried -\nUpdate Nvidia drivers.\nUninstall fully, reinstall from scratch.\nHextech repair function.\nBought a better cooling pad to keep my temps at 60c, a very safe temp for my 970m (battlefield one at 1080 60fps gets far hotter than that, and I can play it for hours on end.)\nLowered all graphics settings\nRan in compatibility mode for Windows 8\nRan as admin\nI also in another ticket that riot closed provided my HW monitor data to riot for a full 40 minute game that I somehow made it through (after all it is every 2 games orso, while sometimes every game)\n\nThis has not only lost me ranked games but has been an actually damaging to my PC partially because I have to HARD SHUT DOWN my pc. This is insane that there is no fix.
