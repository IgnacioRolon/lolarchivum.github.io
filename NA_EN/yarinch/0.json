I play it daily, multiple games a day. But I can't seem to get anywhere near that goal.\nI got every single chest since it came out, never missing one. Right now I have seven unlocked chests.\nEvery month there is a reset, so I can actually get keys, and I can open roughly two boxes (3 if I'm lucky). But afterwards it's almost impossible (for me anyway) to get keys.\nI usually play premade with my friends, very frequently we are 5, but I just can't seem to get enough keys per month.\nAs I said, I have seven chests right now and I should get another one or two until the next reset.\nI know I'm renting about something that is free, but I remember Riot saying you should be able to get enough keys to open all chests every month.\nI don't know if I'm just unlucky, but I just have way too many chests and not enough keys.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-24T17:22:02.317+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Key fragments are not guaranteed, but their chances of dropping are a lot higher at the start and continue to decrease the more you receive it.  This curve resets roughly every 28 days though, so your increased chances restore per our [hextech crafting](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207884233-Hextech-Crafting-Guide).  \n\nYou've received 10 keys since the 21st of last month, so it will likely reset soon and you will start seeing an increased drop again.  I don't recall us ever guaranteeing that you will get enough fragments to open all four chests; however, it is absolutely doable- you'll just need to play more games if you've already had a high drop rate during that period.  Good luck!","replies":[]}]}
