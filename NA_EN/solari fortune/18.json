Lets not forget to mention the incredibly high amount of dashes in the game.  Those dashes make landing a Q in lane near impossible.  Biggest offenders are Yas, LB, Fizz, Ekko, Kata, Talon, Etc.  Then we have to take into account champions with high movespeed as well; Ryze, Ekko, GP, Etc.  \n\nDo you know or know of anybody that is bringing up how bad karthus is?    The only people that do well with him are the mains.  He is literally a \"I main this champion\" champion.     I don't play him, because honestly.  I don't want to spend about 20-30 games per assassin to learn the match up to just break even in lane.   He is incredibly fun, but just overall too unimpactful to play.     \n\nJust wanted to know if he is anywhere in anything in any notes of anyone at Riot.  #BringBackRequiem","replies":[{"poster":"Kindlejack","date":"2016-10-20T08:51:40.753+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's been a loooong time since I had a spare moment to visit live balance, and I don't think he was changed in the Mage update that just happened so I don't know about his future.
