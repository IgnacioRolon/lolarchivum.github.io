In a teamfight with Cc frontlines who lock someone down or thrown on your backline hypercarries, it's pretty huge. I think you vastly underestimate the item. It could even be good in a 1v1 scenario to force your opponent off you or take a really bad all in.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Draehl","date":"2018-03-01T02:00:40.527+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good.
