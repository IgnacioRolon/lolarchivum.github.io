This would allow you to update the splash for those 4 champs as well. It would be similar to how the skins team updated the splash for Jack of Hearts TF when they released the cards based skins laat year.\n\nOf course, that's if you're willing too. I don't know how the Champ Up team feel about making shared splash art. Plus if you do use this idea, you would have to update Galio again when he get his VGU.\n\nJust food for thought since you're a long way out from updating Garen's splash arts.\n\nEDIT: I just remembered you guys did a similar thing with the Pentakill skins when Karthus was VU-ed. Though the Pentakill album was released around the same time, so maybe that was the deciding factor back then.","replies":[{"poster":"Limrick","date":"2016-08-20T08:44:39.480+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rito pls.
