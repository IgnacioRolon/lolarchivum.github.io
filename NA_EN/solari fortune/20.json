However Sion turns into a train which is a pretty redundant feature on a Jaeger. But if transforming into a towering train means nothing for Sion's size then there's no reason Rengar HAS to be of smaller size just because he becomes a race car. \n\nBut yes it really makes little to no sense that both Rengar & Kha'zix would be building sized robots. As what would be the plausibility in their agility and cloaking capabilities if they were lumbering machines.\n\nIt seems to me as one of two things: Either Kha'zix is as towering as the promotional art suggests and Rengar is biting off more than he can chew or they're both of similar size and there's just an huge inconsistency in art here.
