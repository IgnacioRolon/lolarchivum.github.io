I still get the skin, I'm just sad that I won't enjoy looking at the loading screen splash. However, this splash is bad enough that it actually kind of ruins the fantasy of the skin for me a bit. Having played with the skin on the PBE, it's supposed to be a tongue in cheek skin of MF having fun at the pool. The selfie recall defines the skin to me, with MF being cool and relaxed, confident in how sexy she looks.\n\nThis splash though... Why does she almost look angry? She looks like she's stressed about taking the picture more than anything else. And this might sound odd but I just think her facial features are so masculine. I have a fair amount of exposure to drag culture and all I can see in her face is a man in drag rather than an actual woman. The eyes and eyebrows just have it.\n\nI don't like just how enthusiastic everyone is in the background either. MF doesn't look excited or like she's trying to take a fun picture, so why are Lux and Lee so excitable by comparison? It's like they couldn't decide between a 'sexy' splash (MF, supposedly) or a fun one (everyone else) and as a result it just looks messy when looked at together. \n\nI loved Fiora's (some oddly drawn faces but otherwise fine) and respected Taric's (don't like the art style but it's well-made) but I'm really disappointed by MF's, which is a huge pity because it's the skin I like the most in-game. There's nothing we can even do to get it changed now though, given they put it up at the very end of the cycle.","replies":[{"poster":"Only Play Darius","date":"2016-07-06T19:48:03.778+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank god I thought I was the only one who thinks her face looks screwed up.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mogarl","date":"2016-07-06T20:13:52.812+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"With you 100% on the masculine face sentiment.

The things that need to be fixed are her eye on the right side of her head (it's a little too wide and makes her head look strange), and her mouth/jawline area (her mouth is a little too big and the backside of her jaw is a little low/rounded).
