I assumed the troll was a support main because he wanted support as 2nd pick blue side. So banning Thresh was pretty safe.\r\n\r\nNope he decides to lock in Blitzcrank and says he is going to troll. Though he wasn&#039;t serious as his summoner&#039;s were normal. At the very last second he takes smite. And proceeds to follow me in the jungle and try to steal my camps and leave my bot lane to face Vayne Tahm as Lucian. I lost solo jungle EXP and gold, and was eventually counter jungled because I was too far behind to stop Amumu. \r\n\r\nHe then proceeds to spam the N word and tell me to say it. I never said. \r\n\r\nThe sad thing is that he has done this before and is doing it again right now. I haven&#039;t even received a message of his punishment which would be immediate with harassment. He may never get punished because Riot punishes people who harasses others than people who intentionally ruin the game.","replies":[]}
