It was better than the previous 3 games because of the better defending mechanics. It adds more unique attacks with the ability to move while defending in a lot of attacks. The enemy variety pretty good and nearly every enemy have 2-4 attacks and each of them having their own fakeouts and tells. Though some of the tells are pretty hard to see and some are unpredictable. \r\n\r\nI like how the bro moves are separated from each other and have their own moves. Though there&#039;s too many single target moves as the bros while lack of good single target in the dream world. \r\n\r\nThe biggest complaint with the combat are tilt controls. It&#039;s functional but it has no sense of centering itself and momentum is all sorts of screwed up especially when you move vertically. Though I managed to get all S rank on the bro moves challenges despite the weird gyroscope controls. \r\n\r\nNow the writing in this game isn&#039;t that good compared to the other 3. Luigi is pretty well written in this game but the main antagonist is pretty lame. Mario &amp; Luigi have no recollection of characters from the previous games like Popple or Kylie Koopa which was really weird. The two companion characters you get Starlow and Dreambert for some reason don&#039;t ever mix at all. The best characters are the massif bros and the strange lore of bodybuilders was neat. \r\n\r\nThe music in this game was amazing. The boss battle theme was excellent and the final boss music is the best the series has done. Too bad the final boss was a complete pushover. Hey at least the superboss was pretty tough with his much of an asshole his attacks were. \r\n\r\nOverall a really good game. The combat just sold this game to me.","replies":[]}
