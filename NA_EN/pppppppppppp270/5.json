Does that mean a Sacred Stones banner in August. \n\nNext Tempest Trials is Echoes themed but you can get more points on your first runs. And bonus units get stat boosts. Clive is the special unit but Clive is garbage in Echoes. \n\nNext banner is Nohrian summer banner. Featuring Female Corrin riding a dragon. Xander with a Lilith floatie. Elise and Leo are on the banner.\nSummer theme voting gauntlet as well. So I guess the current summer banner is technically extended. \n\nHero fest banner with unknown heroes right now. 5% summon rate on them. \nAlso all future banners after August 7th with have 4 star and 3 star summon rates swapped. Meaning 4 star summons are more common. \nAlso first summon on first time using a banner is free. \n\nAlso a new arena mode called arena assault. Basically squad challenges but in arena format. Probably the scariest challenge yet but you get some new tools to help you like boots for everyone.\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/nbrgcua4sbzy.gif","replies":[]}
