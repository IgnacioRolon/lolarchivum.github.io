Once the laning phase is over Warlords is considerably worse than a mastery that actually improves your team fighting like Fervor or TLD. \n\nIssue is that people don't know how to play against farming champions anymore. They try to go in and force trades and get kills because \"Must win lane\" and then die against someone who is higher health than them when they're really not that strong.\n\nPlay the uninteractive farm lane against them.

(unless they have the said mastery)\n\nWell you didn't say that so how am I supposed to know?\n\nAnd it doesn't do that either.  What Warlord's Bloodlust does do is offer players choices.  It gives them the option to improve their sustain at the cost of combat effectiveness.  Sustain that is very poor unless the champion is already close to death from fighting.  It doesn't remove the ability to trade or punish players.  Contrary to what you said, it punishes the player who DOES take it by weakening their ability to trade.  Having the ability to lifesteal from minions isn't a problem either because gaining that 2% lifesteal against minions when the ADC has already lost 50% of their health is not game breaking.\n\nWorse yet, removing it weakens everyone who doesn't work with Fervor as well as others do and effectively buffing both everyone who works well with Fervor and the damage focused, harass or mage supports.  Can you imagine what S6 would have been like if you got your way and buffed the likes of Lucian, Ezreal and Zyra even more with these changes?\n\nNot all champions are the same and they prefer different things.  You have to allow options for them or we really will get a game with no real champion choice for players.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Copy Mirror","date":"2016-12-16T16:35:41.371+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":2,"body":"I'm not really seeing the problem.
