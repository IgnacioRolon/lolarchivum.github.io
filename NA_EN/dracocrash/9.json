It punishes you for winning. \n\nIf you're a gold 5 playing at a gold 3 level, then you should easily climb to gold 3, by facing off against other gold 5s and gold4s.\n\nBut the MMR hinders you for having a high winrate. Despite you playing as good as a gold 3, the progress is slowed down by pairing you up against other better people, getting up ranks is much more grindy. Instead of just 20ish games to get to gold 3, you now have 30ish games, because you're being paired with and against plats and high tier golds. \n\nThere's also the 2/3 games and 3/5 games system, and provisionals(X/10), which have issues of their own, but those have been addressed.","replies":[{"poster":"DeathTheHorseman","date":"2016-09-03T09:56:25.257+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"True the system punishes you for winning too much because it aims at putting you in that 50% win rate balanced state.\n\nHowever like i said it compensates by giving you more LP when your MMR is higher than your rank.","replies":[{"poster":"Mojihito666","date":"2016-09-03T11:11:35.352+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Forced 50% win rates is anti-balance.","replies":[{"poster":"DeathTheHorseman","date":"2016-09-03T12:43:41.970+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First of all 50% is half of 100% which means it's the very definition of balance.\n\nI think you meant ANTI-FUN not anti-balance... However, look at it from this angle:\n\n**This matchmaking forces constant improvement in each player.**\n\nThe system constantly matches you against people who are your own level so to actually climb and progress (have more than 50% win rate) you need to constantly improve and grow as a player. This is not just on a game to game basis but each time you are unloaded on the rift. If you have 50% chance to win based on statistics, then the game is actually forcing you to get better than you were before starting it so you can take the precious LP. \n\nYou don't get good by stomping against bad players.\n\nU git gud by losing to better players and learning from it.\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}} \n\n\nThe system Riot created aims at improving you as a player as quickly as possible and not your rank and shiny badge.
