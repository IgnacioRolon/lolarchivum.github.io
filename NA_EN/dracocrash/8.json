With TF you have that gold card if she gets near you, you have the blue card to sustain and it's very easy to shove her under tower. Same with Ziggs, hes one of the safer laners and once you get {{item:3174}} you just spam Q while sitting back and pushing her under tower / poking her down. Poke and CC destroy Diana. It sounds like your problem is just not understanding Diana. It's as simple as this, its impossible for Diana to burst you if she doesn't land Q, that's her main source of dmg and that's what resets her ulti.

Yeah everyone says \"Diana burst so high\" well literately that's her only purpose.. doing dmg. None of her abilities do anything else except 1 slow, everything else is just straight dmg.

Azir can only re-position his soldiers every 10 seconds early on. If he uses a Q just dash to him and boom half his hp is gone and he can't do anything about it.
