It's mostly to jungler design and Lee is the beginning of that.\nHe was the first to have literally everything one could wish from a jungle right there for the early game, all while still offereing some utillity later on. He might not be more than a syndrom by now, but he did set the jungle bar that exists till now: \"You have to be atleast this busted early and still atleast that usefull later, or your not viable in high elo jungle\"\nAnd again, that's not an issue with the enviroment, it's an issue with the meta champs beeing balanced around that redicoulus Lee-bar. There's no reason a jungler should be fast clearing, well sustained, good dueling and yet have insane ganking preasure and some solid safety on top all at once, and yet that's what prettymuch every meta jungler has to offer to be viable(well, good dueling can be substituted with high safetyness, it just matters that you can invade without to much worries)\nEven duering the cinderhulk meta, only Gragas and Seju were played in high elo jungle, because unlik other tanks they did have a dash for a reliable escape aswell as strong early clears and ganks.\nJunglers need to be more focused on one thign early rather than good at everything. The guy that can invade me with low risk and probably destroy me 1v1 in my own jungle should not be allowed to powerfarm in between while excerting havey preasure on my lanes with his gank potential.\nGiven that jungle by default has a much higher impact early in the game than other positions, balanceing different junglers around a strong early vs other with a weak early and bad late does not worke, they all need differnt strengths **and weaknesses IN THE EARLY already.**","replies":[]},{"poster":"Volphi","date":"2017-05-16T15:16:26.754+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Revert the jungle changes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DunkinNoobs","date":"2017-05-16T13:19:58.628+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Lee isn't even the hottest, most contested jungler right now.

He has consistently maintained an insanely high pick rate for multiple seasons. The gap between Lee and second also widens at plat+. Ivern while one of the best junglers currently isn't picked and banned anywhere as often as Lee is simply picked. A champion is complained often when they're actually seen, there have been fairly broken champions in the past but not complained about simply because their pick rate was low.","replies":[{"poster":"DunkinNoobs","date":"2017-05-16T20:42:21.380+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Sir Yamazuki,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ERTHosxd,comment-id=00010002,timestamp=2017-05-16T20:22:44.631+0000)\n>\n> Lee Sin&#x27;s pick rate is double that of the second most picked jungler. \n\nThe fact that this is the case and yet he **still** isn't banned is proof that he isn't actually broken.

Where things get hard balance-wise, is that gold income for junglers is almost impossible to get right because if the jungle pays well, then ganking because too risky for most junglers (only the most proficient gankers will find it worthwhile) and you will see late game timebombs like Tryndamere or Master Yi being meta because they can just powerfarm the jungle and reliably turn into monsters later on (sated Devourer meta, anyone?). So you can't make the jungle pay TOO well, you get that problem, but if it doesn't pay well enough, then the only junglers that work are the utility junglers that don't need much gold to function (season 3 jungle meta, anyone?), and that also pushes the game towards junglers _having_ to gank successfully, early, and often, to not get too far behind (once again the proficient gankers become the only gold needing junglers that see play). In the middle, you can get to where a wide variety of jungle champs are at least playable, which is more or less where it is now.","replies":[]},{"poster":"breakordoom444","date":"2017-05-16T13:19:26.738+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"your right.... but the community does not agree.\n\non a game structure point, your right, lee sin is only good in the hands that know him, so does every champ, the outcome of a game depends on the lanes, not the jungler that bought a tent and put it in mid.\n\non a community point..... your wrong and will trigger tons of people because lee sin mains believe he's in the perfect spot since release, honestly even i believe lee sin is quite balanced.","replies":[]}]}
