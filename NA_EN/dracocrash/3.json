Volatile Spider is not just great for AoE clears, the opponent has to run away from it unless they want to get chunked out from it. In Spider Form, Frenzy gives you so much AS that you melt towers at a speed, where even Azir looks jealously at. Cocoon has a 2 second stund on a ~2.8 second Cooldown at level5, that's why I max that second. Q is really not that big in URF imo, as it deals % dmg and almost no one builds builds tank, so you barely do high numbers with it before super late game. \n\n{{champion:43}} >> If you haven't figured it out yet, I love long range poke champs xD Karma is just the next in line with Mantra available pretty much every other second. Your Q shits on everything, your shield is up almost 24/7 which also gives you/your team bonus MS and you have a chain, which you only use because it's there lol. With all her tools, I see her being somewhat immortal, unless you get greedy. All you have to do is RQ and E in tandem and you're good to go ^^\n\n{{champion:22}} >> Honorable mention. mlg420noscope ults every 20 seconds, you will hit something sometime if you just aim randomly on the map, guaranteed!
