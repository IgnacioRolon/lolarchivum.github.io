The JG doesn't own camps nor do laners own their lane cs. For example, if I can't push up in mid or roam w/no creeps; then stealing raptors keeps me active in earning gold. Say JG comes mid and I get the kill; the JG should help me push (taking cs as well) into turret so we can deny enemy cs and exp.\n\nAlso, Jg doesn't usually need buffs late mid-late game.\n\nMid needs blue for wave clear/mana regen/etc. and ADC takes red for the damage boost.\n\nYou actually seem like you have low knowledge regarding the game.
