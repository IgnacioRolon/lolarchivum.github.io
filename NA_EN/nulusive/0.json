Neither of them gave me any IP or a ranking because the champion mastery tab was loading, pretty much the spinning wheel of death. So I have gotten no champion mastery +up or and IP from these last two games. It is not just me, I played these 2 games with my friends and the exact same thing happened to them.\n\nEDIT: I _did_ get IP from them, but there was no champion mastery update. It seems to be a bug with champion mastery, and not IP.","replies":[{"poster":"IamKingOmNom","date":"2016-04-04T22:42:27.691+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ay sir, I am also having the same problem.
