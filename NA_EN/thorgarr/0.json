With 500k+ masteries you may have guessed I love malzahar with passion! Of course I have all his skins. While the skins themselves have color and variety, his spells... all reflect the same color save for the winter one. With that in mind i feel an additional effect of the golden color would be an impactful change that would increase the desirability of the chroma. Even if you only changed the color of his spell shield to a golden tint, it would be a dramatic increase for the skin's overall appeal. Thank you for your time and consideration. \n\nKind regards,\nThorgarr","replies":[{"poster":"Beacon Academy","date":"2018-12-26T22:30:30.981+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They would lose sales on Shadow Prince Malzahar then\n\n###### Just a joke. no kill please","replies":[{"poster":"Thorgarr","date":"2018-12-28T04:09:38.314+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel as though it wouldn't make much difference, seeing as how the gold chroma is event limited, but i guess.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2018-12-25T07:11:20.574+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Maybe Riot is concerned that a shower of yellow particles would look like pee.","replies":[{"poster":"Thorgarr","date":"2018-12-25T08:13:45.037+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have a feeling they just decided to be lackluster on effects. ;/ Gold wouldn't resemble urine to me.","replies":[]}]}]}
