Everywhere from downtown to the rural areas are being affected by this issue, and the cause is unknown. Not sure whether it is rogers' service, riot servers, or something in between, but to go from 25 ping to 180+ is quite odd, especially when all other sites seem to work fine. \r\n\r\nAny help on the topic would be greatly appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"OIeaceae","date":"2017-06-14T01:53:50.614+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"just lost a ranked game because of this. thanks Rogers.","replies":[]},{"poster":"inplane","date":"2017-06-14T02:23:18.145+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tested my ping on everybody's favourite ping tester speedtest.net and it said my ping was 10.

Furthermore, when trying to change masteries, runes, or summoner spells, the occasional \"Failed to change ___\" would appear and then nothing could be changed, even though chat was still updating and useable, nothing else could be changed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yaxuo","date":"2017-06-14T19:44:12.249+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It was happening yesterday afternoon into the evening, however the later it got, the more it seemed to be off and on.
