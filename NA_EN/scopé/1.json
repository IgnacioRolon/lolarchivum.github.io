I have a problem with League since I've installed it. I always have 80-120fps in game but even though, it doesn't feel as smooth as on some of the videos or on another PC i tried to play. It's a bit difficult to describe but the animations and commands of my champion doesn't feel \"natural\".\r\n\r\nMy internet connection doesn't matter because the problem's the same, no matter if my laptop is connected wirelessly or using a cable. It's a bit better in practice tool, but still something feels off. Vertical sync is turned off, movement predicion too (but it doesn't make a difference for me).\r\n\r\nMy PC specs:\r\n\r\nIntel Core i5 4200M 2.5 GHz\r\nGeforce GT 755M\r\n4BG RAM\r\nWindows 10\r\n\r\nWhat can I do to fix it? Is it due to not enough RAM?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-03T01:33:44.327+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You've definitely got enough RAM that's for sure. What you're describing aaaaalmost sounds like packet loss, which would explain why the practice tool runs a little smoother. Basically, packet loss would mean that some of the data being sent to our servers from your network is getting lost of corrupted somehow so the servers don't really know how to read it properly.

The problem remains the same no matter the type of connection (wi-fi or cable). What can I say to describe it even better... It's like feeling lower FPS than it actually is. It has to be something with my PC I guess.\n\nBtw, what can I do in order not to have ping spikes when someone else is using the internet in my house (that's when it gets crazy to even 1000ms)?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-06T20:26:40.472+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That packet loss wasn't too high but it might still be what's causing those weird hiccups with your FPS. Reach out to our tech guys in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and they can walk you through a few steps to see if we can smooth out that connection a bit on our end or not. Sometimes the main source of packet loss comes from your ISP so it may be a good idea to reach out to them as well.\n\nAs for your ping when someone else starts using the internet, there's not a lot I can suggest other than making sure nobody is eating up your bandwidth by downloading big files or streaming a lot of content all at one time.","replies":[{"poster":"Scopé","date":"2017-07-06T21:07:54.369+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I reinstalled League yesterday with the Hextech Repair Tool and it kinda helped.
