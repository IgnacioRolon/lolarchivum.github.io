I hate this champion, his kit, his sounds, his vfx. Everything connected to him makes me wanna pull my hair out. My hatred towards Yasuo is probably one of the strongest feelings in my entire life and thus, I have a request:\r\n\r\nCan you make my account free of him? I don't want to be able to purchase him, I don't want to have a chance of him dropping from Hextech Chest, re-roll or anything like that.\r\n\r\nAlso, I accidentally played him in ARAM once (or one for all) so please, remove all my mastery points on him.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nADC main","replies":[{"poster":"Evil Yasuo","date":"2017-10-04T15:49:31.677+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Stay mad bro.

If you somehow do receive him, you can hit us up in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and we can look into removing him for you manually.","replies":[]}]}
