Legend Leona, who can proc her own passive in exchange for reduced stun durations so she can jungle. Magical Malphite, who has mana scaling instead of armor scaling so he can get more benefit out of a mage build. Accurate Aatrox, who only procs his passive on champions and large minions/monsters to exchange the occasional easier CS for more reliable trades. And think of the potential for pro balance: for example, Regular Ryze could have stronger basic spells than Ryze, but limited to only transporting himself with his ult. 99.999% of players could finally play Ryze/Kalista/Azir/etc. in solo queue without being set up to fail!\r\n\r\nThey&#039;d be totally separate champions with separate skins, but if you already bought one champion version you&#039;d get a 45% discount on the other.","replies":[]}
