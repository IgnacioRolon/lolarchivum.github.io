Spirit Fire has a brief animation but no real delay to allow enemies to dodge it, because the expectation is that he's just creating an area to fight in with autoattacks and Q. With AP items including Liandry's, it becomes very strong harass and an area-denial tool. Malphite's R has a travel time, but it's generally tuned to guarantee a hit on anyone who isn't ready to Flash at a moment's notice, and then he can easily land Q and E, and maybe an auto. With AP items including Luden's and LB, this is easily enough to kill his main squishy target, also weakening nearby enemies.\n\nDid you neglect to ask about AP Shyv because you forgot or because you believe the answer would be obvious?","replies":[{"poster":"letsfeedtogether","date":"2019-04-15T06:09:26.461+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":5,"body":"Actually.

I'm pretty sure Nasus is designed to build tanky items, stack Q damage, and then use his W to stick to targets for consistent autoattacks and Q hits (amplified by E) while his defensive build keeps him alive. Similarly, I'm under the impression that Malphite is designed to build tanky items as well (with a focus on armor), and then use his massive CC to disrupt the enemy lines, while his defensive build lets him survive being surrounded by enemies as his allies deal damage.","replies":[{"poster":"letsfeedtogether","date":"2019-04-15T06:21:20.653+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"No one said nasus should build tanky.","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-04-15T06:32:54.607+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=letsfeedtogether,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=jg5vR3T9,comment-id=00000000000000000000,timestamp=2019-04-15T06:21:20.653+0000)\n>\n> No one said nasus should build tanky.\n\nNo one, sure.

Still, both of these builds generally begin to fall over the higher you get in levels of play, because they're all based around (comparitively) extremely long cooldown abilities to work and have little else to rely on, and become extremely squishy if they mess up, with very little ability to escape or play around the opponent.\n\ni really don't think it's worth spending time complaining about this.","replies":[{"poster":"Saezio","date":"2019-04-16T12:13:15.391+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You are correct in almost everything.\n\nBut Harvest AP shyvana shines in the late game more than any other part of the game.
