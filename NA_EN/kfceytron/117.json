This gives us a very easy solution to pro balance needing to be different from regular balance. Just produce a patch that balances for competitive play with a bit of lead time before tournaments and is only live for a day. Then it can be patched back to the regular version. The pros will then play a patch behind like they usually do, but they can have their proper balance in tourneys and the rest of us can have our proper balance 95% of the time, with one day every few months where we get a taste of pro balance (&quot;wow, how do those people make Kalista work? I gotta watch that LCS!&quot;). It&#039;s not as good a solution as maintaining two separate versions of the game, but it would be significantly better than the compromise we have now, with some strong competitive champs being garbage in low-level play and easier champs being weak in coordinated teams.","replies":[{"poster":"Khristophoros","date":"2018-08-17T22:33:00.050+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly if putting different numbers out for pro play is the correct move, they should just do it without some weird workaround.\n\nI personally don't think it's the correct move.

If a champ's kit is just toxic and unsalvageable, they should just be nerfed until they're reworked (like old Urgot, but unlike old Olaf).","replies":[]}]}]}
