I might listen to it some more to see if I can get a better sense of stories rather than just &quot;this item is an item and here&#039;s what it does.&quot;\r\n\r\n0. Lightbringer: guitar was a little loose, but good heavy metal.\r\n0. Deathfire Grasp: pretty nice power metal, good riffs.\r\n0. Ohmwrecker: I don&#039;t want to be &quot;that guy,&quot; and it sounded okay I guess, but I have to say... too digital.\r\n0. Last Whisper: good heavy metal again.\r\n0. The Hex Core: I don&#039;t think this needed to be a purely instrumental track. It was definitely industrial metal and not heavy metal, somewhere between Static-X and Rob Zombie, both of which I thoroughly enjoy. This track seemed to just kind of meander a lot.\r\n0. The Prophecy: Very brief spoken word track; that&#039;s fine. I was expecting something like &quot;kill&quot; at the end rather than &quot;heavy metal,&quot; but okay.\r\n0. Thornmail: Good heavy metal. Reminded me of Dio or Iron Maiden, except for the solo, which was so distorted/overprocessed it might&#039;ve been played on a keyboard for all I know.\r\n0. Orb of Winter: *Sigh.* See below.\r\n\r\nI didn&#039;t just dislike &quot;Orb of Winter.&quot; This track is _bad_, and I&#039;m not talking about a bit of a tempo flub here or not enough sustain there. The entire plan for this track is a disappointment and a failure. Did someone see &quot;Winter&quot; in the name and immediately think this was a Christmas album? Are we going to the fuckin&#039; Nutcracker for hot buttered rum? What are the sleigh bells and carolers doing here? Are they helping the Sugarplum Fairy? There isn&#039;t the slightest hint of metal in here. This song belongs in a Harry Potter movie. In a Christmas scene. A Hogsmeade visit or something, with a bunch of scenery shots and falling snow and magical playfulness. The fact that someone brainstormed this and pitched it to people who thought it was a _good goddamn idea_ is outright offensive. How did that conversation even go?\r\n\r\n-&quot;Orb of Winter... hmm... what does one do in winter?&quot;\r\n-&quot;Well, what I do in winter is I celebrate Christmas in Louisiana with my in-laws. We spray some fake snow around the porch, then go inside and watch a few minutes of the Nutcracker before changing the channel because we don&#039;t get what&#039;s going on.&quot;\r\n-&quot;PERFECT! WE&#039;RE GONNA SUGARPLUM THE SHIT OUT OF THIS METAL ALBUM!&quot;\r\n-&quot;ok cool&quot;\r\n\r\nNow, don&#039;t get me wrong; I understand that it&#039;s perfectly normal to skip a track from an album every now and then. I skip &quot;Journey to the Promiseland&quot; and &quot;1-2-3-4&quot; by 3 Inches of Blood because they&#039;re purely acoustic and I just can&#039;t bring myself to be interested in them. I skip the acoustic version of &quot;Seasons&quot; by DragonForce because it&#039;s a cover of a song played with real guitars on the same album and it just seems kinda redundant. I skip &quot;Americon&quot; by Slayer because, even though they try to make it brutal, I get an attack of the giggles when I hear Slayer complaining about blood for oil like a hippie (they&#039;re getting old).\r\n\r\nBut &quot;winter = Christmas = Nutcracker&quot; on a purportedly heavy metal album is just idiotic, and there is a difference between being a little out there and being stupid. It&#039;s not even difficult to connect winter and metal: metal was developed in regions that get very cold. Metal events can occur in such an environment, like snow in the beard, spilled blood becoming frozen, ice in the longship&#039;s rigging, lost travelers huddling around a fire while the wind howls around them, etc.\r\n\r\nI plan on checking out the next album, Grasp of the Undying, tomorrow.\r\n\r\nTL;DR: Fine except for the WTF.","replies":[]}
