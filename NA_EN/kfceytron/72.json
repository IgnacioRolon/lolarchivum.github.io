Changing the channel to 0.5 seconds would make it a much more practical item that people might actually buy (without regretting it, anyway).","replies":[{"poster":"HP Crookshanks","date":"2018-08-28T22:59:18.937+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Edge of Night is not terrible.

I'd love to see it be a good AD item rather than a bad assassin item.","replies":[]}]}]}
