You can also sell items purchased with refunded gold. That means you can spend X, then recover X\\*0.7, then spend that, then recover X\\*0.7\\*0.7, and so on, until you&#039;re buying pots. Mathematically, it&#039;s a [geometric convergence](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=sum_(n%3D0)%5E%E2%88%9E+0.7%5En), so if you could buy and sell items for infinitesimal fractions of a gold, you could spend 3 and 1/3 times as much as you earned (including starting gold).\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&infin;\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&sum;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0.7^n = 3 1/3\r\nn=0\r\n\r\n50k divided by 3 1/3 is 15k. This is doable in one or two matches, as long as you remember to return to the shop and do some buying and selling before the game finishes.","replies":[]}
