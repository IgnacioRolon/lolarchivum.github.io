Sometimes u can outdmg ur adc overall... sad, so sad.\nEnter Zyra. I would outdmg my team even with 3 tanky items, cus ugh bronze. Zyra out damages v often in aram, too, but i still can't carry with her sometimes cus im low elo doh.\nShe just scales well, and yes, constantly dishes out tons of dmg. Even if it's a lot of work over time, with zoning, and ccing, and warding (she only bought 1 pink that game though! but when ur ahead, it don tmatter)\n\nGetting kills at the right time is what's important, tho. If u cant get something out of it, or get super fed, 'a lot of dmg' will remain just that.\n\nidk about 8 years ago, but carry supports like brand and lux have been a thing for 4+ years now. i never agreed with it. i just got with the program.
