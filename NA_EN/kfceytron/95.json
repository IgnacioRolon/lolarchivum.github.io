In that condition, any attempt to do pretty much anything is bound to end in another death, which only widens the gap, until they're 5-6 levels and 8-9k gold behind the enemy carry. And yet it still takes half an hour to close out a game, which leaves lots of time for those deaths to pile up. How is the system supposed to tell when someone dies every 2 minutes on purpose vs once by accident followed by 13 times inevitably? It can't, and it errs on the side of caution, so we end up with inters losing games on purpose and getting away with it because it's indistinguishable from the results of making one tiny slip-up early game.","replies":[{"poster":"Jng Account","date":"2020-02-18T08:04:40.797+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"But it never worked, even when laning phase took 20+ mins and score were single digits.\n\nThats why you dont ban inters based solely on their KDA and gold.\n\nAlso anyone who is 5-6 lvls and 8-9k gold behind in soloQ should be banned.","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2020-02-18T09:11:47.249+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Jng Account,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Yw5EmEdo,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2020-02-18T08:04:40.797+0000)\n>\n> But it never worked, even when laning phase took 20+ mins and score were single digits.\n> \n> Thats why you dont ban inters based solely on their KDA and gold.\n> \n> Also anyone who is 5-6 lvls and 8-9k gold behind in soloQ should be banned.\n\nI like how you say that bans shouldn't be based on KDA and gold but should be based on levels and gold. That's totally a very different and much better basis! Bro, not everyone is a \"Jng Account.\" With someone filling in jungle, especially in the state it's in right now, it's not that uncommon.","replies":[{"poster":"RyzeRework","date":"2020-02-18T17:23:29.105+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmm even when I jungle and get super far behind I dont think I would get 5 to 6 levels down","replies":[]}]}]}]}
