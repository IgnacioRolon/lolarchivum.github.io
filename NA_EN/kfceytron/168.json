However, that isn't happening now. Instead, no tooltip window is created, nor is there even any indication that something's supposed to happen. It behaves like a plain link.\r\n\r\nAttempting to vote on a thread or a comment results in no visible feedback as well, not even \"so sad, not authorized.\" The vote buttons still light up when moused over, but nothing happens on click.\r\n\r\nI've checked Chrome and Firefox on two accounts and observed the exact same behavior across the board. No errors show up in the dev console when I attempt these actions.","replies":[{"poster":"Julevi","date":"2020-01-21T21:33:11.943+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey OP, I had the same issue (voting) today - you are not alone!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Modi","date":"2020-01-21T14:32:52.360+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Works fine for me","replies":[]},{"poster":"Periscope","date":"2020-01-21T19:45:20.476+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Works ok for me.
