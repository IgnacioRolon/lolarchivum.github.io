I understand the occasional generic rudeness taking a while to get through the pipeline (or being deemed &quot;rude, but we&#039;re okay with that sometimes&quot;), but these posts seem like zero-tolerance things that should make a mod go &quot;whoaaaa gotta baleet that fast&quot; rather than &quot;meh, doesn&#039;t seem worth opening the mod tools today. I&#039;ll just mark this Processed so it leaves the queue.&quot;\r\n\r\nI&#039;m generally told something like &quot;thanks for bringing that to our attention, we&#039;ll handle it,&quot; but then nothing happens and the porn/slur/threat is still there, days later.\r\n\r\nAre these things actually allowed, given certain posters, time of day, alignment of the planets, etc.? Am I wasting my time?\r\n\r\nIf they&#039;re not allowed, why aren&#039;t they removed? Do the mods get distracted between marking a post as handled and actually handling it? Do technical glitches sometimes cause a reported post not to display properly in the queue or something?
