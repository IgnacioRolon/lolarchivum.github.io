It stands on its own. If a mod thinks something is inappropriate, it's against the rules, plain and simple. And I'm okay with that being a rule! But, since I'm not a mod, I cannot determine what's appropriate, and we don't have enough tools to reliably determine what a mod would think of any given post (clear rules). Therefore, the mods should take on an active role in ensuring appropriate posts - _before_ we post something inappropriate. I _want_ to follow the rules. As a programmer, I'm _good_ at following rules, and even figuring out unwritten rules from time to time. However, the documentation on these rules is too sparse, and the error messages are unhelpful (basically \"your post was bad and you should feel bad; go read these unhelpful rules\").","replies":[]}]}]}
