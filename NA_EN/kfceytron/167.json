It worked fine on my other accounts. I was hoping it was just a display bug, so I logged out and back in, but it still showed as not completed. First Win shows as completed, so it doesn&#039;t seem like the bug from the VS mission that all mission progress was happening but not showing. Just randomly didn&#039;t count.","replies":[]}
