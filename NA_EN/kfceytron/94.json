And not in a \"so bad it's good\" way, which is what I was expecting. I legitimately thought it was a good movie.\r\n\r\nWhy is it known as one of the worst movies of all time?\r\n\r\nBased on Rotten Tomatoes review blurbs, the main problem is the plot, the most problematic part of which is probably the idea of the main character not having aged in a century. This didn't bother me, because I know the history of the game series: the original game was basically \"stylish detective resolves spooky haunted house mystery in 1910,\" while the sequel is a modern action/shooter about monsters that can't abide the light and possess people or something. Unfortunately, the sequel tries to tie itself to the original game by keeping the same main character... from 1910... with a completely different appearance and personality. And a new story. And new genre. In short, the sequel is some random-ass game that licensed an old IP for the recognizable name. It's very confusing, and it's not very good, which is why it was a critical failure. The point is that this oddity is a feature of the franchise that was basically ported over to the movie, which is largely based on that modern sequel. The connection to 1910 barely gets a few seconds of screen time and no characters even have any lines about it. But yes, the plot has problems, even though they come from the source material.\r\n\r\nI also suspect that it doesn't really fulfill its supposed genre: it's a horror movie, but the most \"horror\" parts about it are monster/zombie battles backed by metal music and gunfire. It seemed more like a straightforward action/thriller film than a horror film to me. The thing is, I don't like horror movies. I like metal music and gunfire, and that's what this movie delivered. Does that make it a bad movie?\r\n\r\nP.S.: If you haven't seen it and actually want to check it out, you can watch it [here](https://tubitv.com/movies/457131/alone_in_the_dark) (basically an ad-supported Netflix clone, no signup required, just hit Play).","replies":[]}
