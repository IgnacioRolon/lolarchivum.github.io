{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-08-27T07:19:14.826+0000","title":"Mod challenge: find me ten good PB threads from ten permabanned players","subforum":"Discuss the Boards","up_votes":6,"down_votes":6,"body":"A permaban for a toxic player indicates that Riot no longer believes that player capable of reform. Punishments didn't prompt self-reflection, warnings of losing the account were ignored, all the toxic behavior was rationalized with a variety of terrible arguments. Did more than four punishments do the trick for some people? Yes, but this was very infrequent, and not worth the damage caused by all the consistently toxic players who didn't learn and were allowed to keep playing. Riot doesn't believe a permabanned player will improve, and they're not interested in letting them try. Riot wants those players to leave.\r\n\r\nThese people who are unable to follow rules and behave themselves then go onto the Boards and start insisting that their ban was unjust, and any other player's permaban was unjust, and the number of reports matters, and someone else started it, and so on. When someone disagrees with them, they start to demonstrate why they got a permaban in the first place: poor behavior. They pollute the place with bad ideas, bad advice, and uncivil discourse. Sometimes permabanned players post on each other's threads to show support for misbehavior, like a bunch of convicts banging their tin cups against the bars. What's the point of discussing their ban, anyway? It's permanent, and Riot wants those people to quit the game.\r\n\r\nEven now there is a highly-upvoted thread on the front page about how permabans for toxic chat are bad because permabanned players just make new accounts anyway, and how a clever and novel solution would be... stacking chat restrictions. This was posted, of course, by a player who was permabanned for toxic chat and isn't happy about being punished. They have no problem with breaking the rules and annoying people; they just don't like it when something bad happens to _them_. Note that most permabanned players don't keep playing, and Riot tried stacking chat restrictions but it didn't work and just produced more toxic behavior that was more difficult to detect. The thread is selfish and poorly-researched. And yet, it has tons of upvotes, currently at 71-24, with a poll at 179-59. But you look at the comments and see half a dozen players - all relentlessly toxic and permabanned - insisting that this is a good idea and they shouldn't have been permabanned and it was a setup and it was all the other guy's fault and so on and so on with all the same trash they always spew because they're basically sociopaths. Harsh, but I'm not mincing words here. And most of them say they have a giant pile of smurf accounts. Now let's do some math: a few toxic players multiplied by a giant pile of smurf accounts each... what do you know! That's how many upvotes this thread has. It's an obvious example of vote manipulation, bringing a demonstrably useless thread (the idea has been tried and proven ineffective, remember) to the forefront.\r\n\r\nThis brings us to my challenge to mods. Genesis 18-19 is the well-known story about the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah. Abraham convinced God to spare these sinful cities if they contained a mere ten righteous people. Unfortunately, there weren't any, and the cities were destroyed.\r\n\r\nIf you can find me ten separate Player Behavior threads by ten separate permabanned players where the player asked about their ban, behaved themselves, learned, thanked respondents for teaching them the error of their ways, improved their behavior, reformed, and became an upstanding player/member of the community (flying in the face of Riot's real-world data, mind you), then I will at least be willing to entertain the idea that perhaps those extraordinary cases are worth the absolutely massive amount of chaff. We're paying a cost, so there should be _some_ benefit. But if you can't, then I urge you to stop allowing permabanned toxic assholes to trash that Board, and just instantly delete any thread or comment in PB posted by a permabanned player. Don't permaban them from Boards entirely; just remove anything they post in PB.\r\n\r\nNote that I'm not just talking about threads that weren't quite bad enough for mods to lock/delete, because that almost never happens even when it obviously should. I'm talking about threads that are _actually good and useful_ from permabanned players.\r\n\r\nIf nothing else, the time period covered by ten such posts should show us how often we see such a chimera around here, and perhaps make a case for much stricter moderation on low-quality content from players who are already known to specialize in such.\r\n\r\nTen separate threads, ten separate permabanned players, ten separate success stories.","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2019-08-27T12:54:28.141+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"1.

I assumed that it worked. But now that I can visit the link, I counter that that was not a good example of a positive thread. The OP is a child (15) who has over 30 permabans and yet believes that all their misbehavior is the game's fault because they're a fantastic person who gets little social interaction and is \"prone to snappping at people who provoke [them]\" but only rages in game because \"when [the] jungler is truly useless\" it provokes \"provokes [their] flaming.\" I was in that thread. It was not positive. There was no growth, only denial and severe RL social issues.\n\nVote-botted \"stacking chat restrictions are the answer\" thread: https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/7RTLWEuK-an-long-essay-on-permabans-one-size-fits-all-policies-dont-work","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2019-08-27T13:54:24.186+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=KFCeytron,realm=NA,application-id=6heBIhQc,discussion-id=qjasOEbd,comment-id=0003000100000000,timestamp=2019-08-27T13:37:01.173+0000)There was no growth, only denial and severe RL social issues.\n\nHow you react to a player matters. My own interaction with the OP in that thread was one where, to me, it seemed the OP took the feedback. Pushing back slightly is both allowed and a part of growth. The player asked for in-game advice, and so I provided in-game advice. It's not really our place to assume, as you suggested, \"You don't need League-specific advice; you need skills and strategies to help you cope with other people who may or may not meet your expectations, because everyone needs to deal with that throughout their life, at least occasionally.\"\n\n> Vote-botted \"stacking chat restrictions are the answer\" thread: https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/7RTLWEuK-an-long-essay-on-permabans-one-size-fits-all-policies-dont-work\n\nI'm not convinced that's a vote-botted thread (it's surprisingly well presented for suggestions like that, and could also simply have been shared other places).

I didn't assume anything. OP flat-out said that they rarely have social interactions, and when they do they tend to snap at people. That's a pretty clear issue not limited to League. And yet, OP thinks that League is the problem because their RL behavior is fine.\n\nMan, there are like half a dozen commenters, half of them saying \"this is a bad idea because it's been proven not to work,\" and the other half saying \"my 20 permabanned accounts and I think this is genius.\" It's not hard to put two and two together.

Riot's policy against overturning them and their want for those players to leave League do not diminish those reasons.\n\nThe only practical use I've seen for such discussion is when the only thing someone did was to repeat someone else's ZT phrases in an undirected fashion (\"hey, don't call me a --- please\"), and those cases are very rare. For the rest, I see no _practical_ reason to discuss a permaban. There are personal reasons, of course - I'm sure some people enjoy putting the smackdown on someone who brings racist/homophobic slurs to a LoL match - but that's not a practical reason, and doesn't justify the situation.","replies":[{"poster":"Umbral Regent","date":"2019-08-27T12:50:09.933+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Right, but my point is to question whether they should have that right.

If they're going to be barred from posting in PB on account of having their account in-game permanently banned, then it may as well extend to the rest of the boards, too.\n\nBut, they _should_ have the right to discuss League of Legends on their account whether it's banned in-game or not. If they're banned in-game on that account, then they can no longer break the rules in-game on that account; they may still have an interest in discussing the game, or even discussing their own punishment.\n\nIf you want to strip them of their right to post on the boards, you have to have a legitimate reason that their permanent ban in-game should disqualify them that right.\n\n> They're already crying like that about Riot's \"Big Brother-esque censorship\" - sometimes literally, when they claim that chat restrictions infringe on their freedom of speech.\n\nAnd it would not help to give them further fuel to rant and rave harder.

Maybe if they can't post on PB, they similarly won't come back. I think we should at least attempt to make PB not garbage.\n\nIf they can't post on PB, they'll go to GD, or RANT, or Discuss the Boards, or elsewhere as long as it's a vaguely similar avenue to discuss their punishment, however fruitless.\n\nIt's much the same as the issue with indefinitely-scaling chat restrictions.\n\n> You think mods shouldn't even try to find positive posts from permabanned players because I might not totally change my mind?\n\nConsidering that, at the end of the day, you've only the power to suggest a course of action and not implement it? They're not obligated to go searching for posts to rise to your challenge.\n\nYou want to see players whose accounts in-game are permabanned disallowed from posting in PB. This isn't even close to a good way of tackling the problem it's meant to hit - because there are people who hold strict disagreements with Riot's system and spread misinformation who _haven't_ been permanently banned.\n\nAnd even if the majority of the issue lay with those permabanned players, taking such a straightforward, \"get them out of here\" approach would cause more harm than good, even if it _did_ solve the problem in any capacity.\n\n> And yet we allow those players to post, even though we might not totally change their mind, and they won't change our mind...\n\nPeople are allowed to maintain their opinions, even after discourse has resolved. They're allowed to be ignorant and wrong and everything else, subjective or otherwise. Even people I've largely disagreed with have held discussions that have, at the very least, made me think about shit. And some of those discussions were aggravated, heated, and uncivil; only just toeing the line of what was allowed.\n\nWe don't _need_ to change people's minds. More often than not, we _can't_. All we can do, and what we need to do, is get the right information out there and at least let it be seen. People can disagree with it, they can call it bullshit and argue against it 'till the cows come home, but so long as we get the information out, we'll have done our job.\n\n> Okay. Ten cases and I'll admit that allowing permabanned players to post on PB has enough value to hold off on removing those posts on sight (although I'll still maintain that it's trash overall).\n\nBelieve me when I say I'm working on a list. It'll take plenty of time for me to find other cases, but it's underway.\n\n> Still, people will check the dates of those threads and come to whatever conclusion that evidence supports anyway. I think you'd agree that finding ten such cases within the last week would be substantively different from having to go back to 2013, when these Boards came online.\n\nI would agree, yes.

It may only work for one in fifty, one in a hundred, one in a thousand, but so long as there's the possibility that someone will be receptive, it will be worthwhile to explain the punishment and the system to hundreds of belligerent players.\n\n> ...and 6 is flat-out incorrect, because they no longer have an account on which to reform. Riot does not want permabanned players to create new accounts. Why would we tell them to?\n\nIf someone shows an interest in reforming and coming back to the game after a permanent suspension, I see no issue with encouraging them to do so. Yes, Riot wants people to leave when they permaban them, but - we're not Riot. As players, we are at liberty to make our own judgement calls with how we advise other players.\n\nIf I see genuine remorse and the potential for someone to reform, I'll tell them they can start afresh - hell, I might even _encourage_ it. I wouldn't see them off flying by the seat of their pants, of course, but the point remains - Riot's goal may be to have them leave, but they cannot feasibly prevent them from coming back, and it ultimately isn't against the rules for them to come back. If they choose to reform, all the power to them.\n\n> Most permabanned players don't return. And if they do come back, I agree that it'd be better if they reform (which to me is synonymous with not breaking the rules anymore), but they won't. That is why they got a permaban.\n\nWhether or not they'll reform isn't a certainty. Granted, a lot of players make it abundantly clear just how well their second/third/umpteenth account is going to go, but just because a person got permabanned doesn't mean they're incapable of reforming.\n\nI've seen cases - rare though they may be - where people realized just how shitty their behavior was too little, too late. And I've seen people struggle with reforming after the fact, too. You can't be certain that just because they got a permanent suspension that they can't reform - that's like saying that anyone who spent any amount of time at Honor Level 0-1 will always be toxic and just run their account into the ground.\n\n> For the rest, I see no practical reason to discuss a permaban. There are personal reasons, of course - I'm sure some people enjoy putting the smackdown on someone who brings racist/homophobic slurs to a LoL match - but that's not a practical reason, and doesn't justify the situation.\n\nI think getting the information out there and learning from other peoples' mistakes to build a better understanding of how the system works are practical enough reasons to discuss permanent bans. Those are my two biggest reasons, and I figure there are at least a good couple other players on the PB boards who have similar or even different reasons to discuss those punishments as well.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"GatekeeperTDS","date":"2019-08-27T11:16:01.344+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You had me up until the religious part.
