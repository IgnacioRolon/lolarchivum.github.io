C.f. [Champion Weaknesses in 2019](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/qzzu5y4t-champion-weaknesses-in-2019), briefly summarized as &quot;we just learned that champions should have weaknesses.&quot;\n* They are slowly stripping the load screen of all pertinent information until it&#039;s just a retcon delivery system.\n* They release a champ, then realize it&#039;s awful and nerf it to dumpster tier. Then they rework it, eventually realize it&#039;s awful in different ways, and then dumpster it again or revert it. Akali, Irelia, and Aatrox are the most recent examples.\n* They fix items by making them worse, and then flail around for a while before reverting.\n* They slowly realize that giving so many female champions the same body type is a bad thing, while giving more and more male champions the same body type. Sylas shouldn&#039;t even be buff; he should be scrawny and malnourished after being chained up in prison for 15 years. And he and Kayn have the same face. THE SAME. FACE. Did Sylas Hijack that too?\n\n##Regarding items:\n\nToday&#039;s example is crit items and Infinity Edge: they reworked an entire class&#039;s items and then spent _a year and a half_ desperately trying to shore up the obvious bungle. For reference, here&#039;s the [reworked IE patch note](https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-811-notes):\n\n> We&#039;re making Infinity Edge into a true scaling item for marksmen, one which amps up the power of critical strike but isn&#039;t itself a critical strike item.\n\nThey make it sound like a good idea and a step forward. Now let&#039;s look at the [latest patch note about IE](https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-93-notes), where it&#039;s almost fully reverted (a tiny bit more crit chance and a tiny bit less bonus crit damage than before):\n\n> We&#039;re restoring Infinity Edge&#039;s synergy with itself to make it a more immediately gratifying pickup. Removing its true damage conversion means it no longer anti-synergizes with Last Whisper, while setting its crit damage bonus to 25% rather than the historic 50% lets us maintain our original goal of mitigating the late-game squishy melting marksmen used to achieve.\n\nThey make it sound like a good idea and a step forward _again_. That, frankly, is impossible, given that it&#039;s going in the opposite direction. But you won&#039;t see verbiage like &quot;we&#039;re removing IE&#039;s synergy with itself and making it a lackluster pickup&quot; in the rework text, nor &quot;delaying an item&#039;s usefulness by making one of its stats nonexistent until other purchases was a terrible idea&quot; in the revert text. Do you know where I&#039;ve seen this &quot;every direction is forward&quot; charade? WoW. Do you know what WoW has also had? Level 80 prot paladins soloing raid bosses from two expansions _ahead_ of them.\n\nAnd let&#039;s take just a moment to talk about Essence Reaver. The goal was a mana sustain item for AD champs, like Athene&#039;s and then Necronomicon used to be for AP champs. From the very start, all of ER&#039;s mana sustain has been back-loaded into the finished item, even though mana is most concerning in early game. It initially provided moderate ADC stats and restored mana equal to a percent of damage done based on missing mana. Then it turned into this weird crit/CDR thing that restored max mana on crit. Now it&#039;s an AD/CDR item that restores missing mana on hit and restores basic ability CDs on hit after you ult, and it&#039;s basically a joke item on everyone but Renekton, a manaless champion. -_-\n\n##Regarding the load screen:\n\n* Did you know that this screen used to tell us the ping and load progress for each player in the match? But being informed that your Zed has 800 ping and thus may have difficulty executing combos was deemed toxic, so other players&#039; ping displays were hidden.\n* And then Riot added &quot;Did You Know&quot; tips ranging from obvious things like &quot;last hit minions for gold&quot; to less obvious things like &quot;attack your opponent while they&#039;re last hitting a minion.&quot; Hit or miss, but not too bad.\n* But the lore team felt left out, so a giant pile of brand-new lore that replaces old lore was added to the &quot;Did You Know&quot; pool. Not only is lore less relevant than gameplay tips, but it&#039;s &quot;new&quot; lore, which is a nice way of saying that lore is disposable so you shouldn&#039;t get too attached to it.\n* Somewhere around this time, though, a good thing happened: Riot added a little &quot;ongoing progress&quot; indicator so we&#039;d know if loading was working or frozen. (Credit where credit is due.)\n* However, we now have a shiny new load screen that removes even more information. Not only can we not see other players&#039; load progress, _we can&#039;t see our own_. Yes, we&#039;re not even allowed to judge our own computer&#039;s load times anymore.\n* If that wasn&#039;t bad enough, the load screen is about three pixels tall at the very bottom of the screen, barely visible.\n* Worse still, a mistake anyone could spot in seconds (I sure did): the new load progress bar is an _average_. What the hell is the point of that? That&#039;s a terrible algorithm to choose for displaying load progress, given that the match only loads when the _slowest_ machine either completes the process or disconnects. There&#039;s no point in shooting up to 80% or 90% in 15 seconds and then sitting there for five minutes. It should just show the lowest value.\n* However, credit where credit is due once again: bots in co-op aren&#039;t included in the figure, so it&#039;s the average load progress of all actual connected players.\n* But of course there has to be one last thing: the ping display in the load screed now updates somewhere around 5-10 times per second, making it basically unreadable.","replies":[]}
