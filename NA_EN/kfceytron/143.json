Definitely not unwatchable, though. Most of the acting was wooden, and the few believable performances were brought down by lines that were frankly stupid, to say nothing of over-the-top delivery. Like, there's this one cowboy who keeps calling everyone a %%%%%%%%%%... including himself at one point. Does the character know what the word means? I'm not sure. Also, these are not movies to watch with your parents, because the sex scenes aren't subtle at all and you will be uncomfortable watching these with company, I assure you. This might only be the \"unrated\" versions I watched, though. Lots of blood, too, all the time. Like, in this one battle, some dude is frantically stabbing what's basically a pile of intestines and other assorted organs. That vampire's not gonna bite you, bro.\r\n\r\nI've also had more than a bit of schnapps, so that helps.\r\n\r\nhttps://data.whicdn.com/images/95829450/large.jpg","replies":[]}
