However, I've noticed that these events don't seem to have cooldowns. This results in hearing the same 5-10 interactions over and over again, generally 10-20 seconds apart. However, these interactions sometimes trigger with less space between them than an interaction's duration, so they end up delivering more than one interaction's lines at a time, talking over themselves and each other.\r\n\r\nThese interaction triggers should be frozen while one is in progress, at the very least. Ideally, add a bit more delay on top of that, perhaps a minute or so.","replies":[]}
