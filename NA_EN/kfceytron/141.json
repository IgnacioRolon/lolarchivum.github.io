And every time a new champion or rework is introduced, guess what? That&#039;s yet another interaction that will have to be tested but probably won&#039;t to any useful degree because that testing load is just too damn high. Vandiril is going to have so much work to do trying to document the bugs and problems, and all he&#039;ll get for it is a few months of Reddit gold. This champion will be disabled due to game-breaking bugs with unusual frequency.\r\n\r\nSeriously, Riot; are you _trying_ to create bug magnets here? Didn&#039;t anyone at a single meeting say &quot;that sounds like orders of magnitude more QA work for something that will never be consistent or balanceable, all to avoid having to think of a new ult&quot;?","replies":[{"poster":"3TWarrior","date":"2019-01-09T04:09:06.559+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"now imagine him stealing mordekaiser's ultimate\n\nwonder what the implications of that will be\n\nsomeone mentioned shaco as well","replies":[]}]}
