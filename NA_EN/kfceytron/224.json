The recent addition of showing expanded tooltips by holding down the Shift key provides a great opportunity as well: this expanded tooltip should show the ult tooltip for every champion in the game. This would come into play when a Sylas player faces an enemy Sylas, allowing both players to look up ults from their team that they might end up stealing back from their mirrored counterpart, not to mention ults stolen from units coded as champions, such as the Loot Teemo and Loot Veigar in Nexus Blitz (the racing Scuttle and the walking Nexus are coded as champions as well, so this full list should include those too). As a bonus, this would be a good test of that functionality&#039;s stability and robustness. Will it lag when showing large tooltips; does it use a scrollbar or page view to handle overflow; is there a search filter; etc.","replies":[]}
