Centering the camera during this time (default: spacebar) forces locked camera, with that hotkey still not working. The hotkey only becomes active once you click the button for it in the HUD.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce:\r\n\r\n0. Click and drag the minimap\r\n0. Cast your ult\r\n0. During the second cast time, let go of the mouse button\r\nYou are now forced into unlocked camera. The keyboard hotkey to toggle camera modes doesn't work.\r\n0. Press spacebar to center the camera.\r\nYou are now forced into locked camera. The keyboard hotkey to toggle camera modes doesn't work.\r\n0. Manually click the HUD button to toggle camera modes, located near the minimap.\r\nYou can once again toggle camera modes with the keyboard hotkey.\r\n\r\nReproducible 100% of the time.","replies":[]}
