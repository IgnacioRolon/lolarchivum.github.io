Compared to me, the enemy team&#039;s Lux had double my champ damage, 1/3rd my shielding, 30% less damage taken, and 50% more CC.\r\n\r\nAnd my team wasn&#039;t even bad, as far as I could tell. We didn&#039;t do anything ridiculous, made some good plays, and yet we got nowhere while the enemy team just rolled over us. Where the hell did we go wrong? Usually I can see that some poor plays resulted in a snowball, or we got to sudden death which is basically a coin flip, but this time I&#039;m just confused.\r\n\r\nhttps://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/2947897564/219822320?tab=overview\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xsxRESffiA","replies":[{"poster":"WashyMoney","date":"2019-01-07T05:18:17.281+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Imagine thinking taking the least damage is a good thing lol.

Taking some damage is unavoidable and occasionally beneficial, but pointing at a Lux's low damage taken as a _bad_ sign?","replies":[{"poster":"WashyMoney","date":"2019-01-07T11:35:18.678+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean if you consistently find yourself taking the least on your team or in the game then yes. It just shows that you are content with sitting pretty far back and throwing out spells, even if you could walk maybe a bit further up and get much more value abilities. I mean, if you’re trying to carry. Play around enemy cooldowns, you are not _always_ in threat of being one shot. That’s just bullshit. Even ADCs are able to flash forward when key cooldowns are down to take out priority targets. \n\nThis isn’t something that you can learn from a YouTube video or something , you need to play games and look for opportunities and take them. Eventually you will realize your limits and improve. Playing super passive won’t accomplish shit. Doing the most damage doesn’t mean anything because you’re doing “low value” damage. Hitting full HP tanks or squishies when it doesn’t accomplish anything is low value (no tower damage, no objectives from the poke, etc). Flash, double Q on their carries, 1-shotting them, and then dying is better than sitting back and maybe just losing the teamfight but surviving. This kind of killer instinct takes time to develop.","replies":[]},{"poster":"xDogMeatx","date":"2019-01-07T06:41:58.175+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its not a bad sign its just enemy lux looks like she had more chances to deal damage due to her rush comp. voli garen and taric combo theres actually more she can do vs your end who can only support the WOMBO COMBO comp minus nid.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"xDogMeatx","date":"2019-01-07T04:27:18.259+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"honestly just by looking at the team comp you have no adcish champion (if yasuo is adc though aka the carry he would have trouble getting that point due to range/cc difference). also they got more rush styled champions, garen/volibear/taric combo. at late game it becomes broken rush team that rushes deadmans therefore becomes op due to that ez setup. while the enemy lux can stop vital plays at ease (assuming she had more end game stat graphs).","replies":[]}]}
