And her Q looks like Jhin's W (only BiGgEr). She even autoattacks slowly. If I were returning to the game after a years-long absence, I would think that Jhin had gotten a VGU.","replies":[{"poster":"Der Lindwurm","date":"2019-11-16T16:20:44.518+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, the cat's out of the bag - Senna is actually Jhin cosplaying redeemed Riven.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Velzard of Koz","date":"2019-11-16T14:51:02.754+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> And her Q looks like Jhin's W (only BiGgEr).\n\nIt's actually kinda supposed to be copy of Lucian's Q.\n\nOtherwise yes, they were made by the same guy, though you'd think that shouldn't matter since most of these are visual things that should be handled by different person (models, animations).\n\nI think they wanted slow but hard hitting champ, which Jhin partially is (slow in attacks), so they went with what they have and works and got inspired by it. The artist very well might've gotten inspired by Jhin's movements exactly for the reason they are supposed to have the same feel. They maybe gave the design into Jinxylord's hands because they are supposed to feel the same in attacks so they trusted he'd handle it well.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HalfTangible","date":"2019-11-19T01:31:36.136+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A Jhin VGU would turn his pistol into a BFG, make him into a black woman with no mask, make his cloak bigger and change his name to \"Senna\" in the login screen?","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-11-19T02:03:11.010+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=HalfTangible,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=P4EMbhPX,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2019-11-19T01:31:36.136+0000)\n>\n> A Jhin VGU would turn his pistol into a BFG, make him into a black woman with no mask, make his cloak bigger and change his name to \"Senna\" in the login screen?\n\nLike I clearly said, all I can see of Senna in game is a cloak and a gun, so the only improbable part about your hypothetical is the name change. The least noteworthy part would probably be making his cloak bigger. Like, \"whoa, Jhin's cloak is bigger? That's not my Jhin! Revert now!\", right?\n\nLike I clearly also said, \"unpopular opinion.\" I know that phrase has been diluted into its opposite nowadays, but when I say it I mean it.","replies":[]}]}]}
