Could the Discord get some sort of &quot;we&#039;re away, back at N:00&quot; thing? Or an estimated wait time indicator? Taking it out of real time would be fine, too; I&#039;d much rather have a conversation that takes a few minutes of my time over the course of a few days than waste hours of attention only to not have a conversation at all.\r\n\r\nNote: this isn&#039;t a complaint. I&#039;m just thinking that maybe the process of speaking with a mod could be improved.","replies":[{"poster":"Ulanopo","date":"2018-11-11T05:54:50.515+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I gotchu.

Since it is purely a volunteer moderation. There will be times that unavailability will just happen to overlap.\n\nMaking available hours means some mods will have to make sure they are available during such; pretty much making it feel like a job at that point. Sonwhile it might need some improvement, hours available and wait time may not be the avenues to look at.","replies":[]}]}
