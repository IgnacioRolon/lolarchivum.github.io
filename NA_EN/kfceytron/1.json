That's when I forgot to add the [], as Giphy links don't require that and my original link to the Imgur version didn't need it because it wasn't trying to render it.\n\nActually actually, when I made the edit and then refreshed, it simply showed the gif properly, so I thought nothing more of it. Refreshed again after seeing your reply and it was wonky.","replies":[{"poster":"Laughing Fish","date":"2019-04-24T04:27:55.004+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Oof, I know that feel.
