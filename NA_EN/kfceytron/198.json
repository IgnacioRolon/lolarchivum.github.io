What if you could get basic rewards for ordinary views, but your account has a chance to &quot;critically view&quot; a video (no practical difference, just a special kind of credit) for special rewards? Riot could even sell &quot;items&quot; to increase your &quot;crit chance&quot; for anywhere from a handful of games to a whole season, to help you increase your likelihood of finishing the fancy bonus missions in time and not having to rewatch as many VODs.\r\n\r\nThis would boost esports viewership and engagement in addition to providing secondary sales on the new merchandise, demonstrating a clear uptick in esports interest!\r\n\r\n{{sticker:garen-swing}}","replies":[{"poster":"miniquandt","date":"2019-01-22T20:38:40.938+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"They would never do the \"Watch esports to get more Crit/dmg\" because that would essentially be pay to win.

They could sell the equivalent of passes but call them items for branding purposes, and the \"item\" (notice the quotes, like I used in the OP) would increase your chance to get a special reward from viewing an esport match. It has literally nothing to do with in game performance. Please read more carefully before commenting next time; thanks.","replies":[]}]}]}
