In Nexus Blitz, however, the first event forces confrontation right when people who haven&#039;t missed out on exp are hitting 6, while anyone who lost a trade and had to recall still hasn&#039;t unlocked their ult. The impact from this can be negligible in an event like BR due to the breathing space before fighting actually starts, but being first up in a prize fight without ult is like being the first to present your project to the class when the teacher knows you were out sick.\r\n\r\nI know that it&#039;s only fair that pushing your opponent out of lane should reward some kind of advantage, but this advantage is too big. The difference between levels 6 and 7 is okay, but 5 and 6 is not.","replies":[{"poster":"Cats Are Food","date":"2018-12-28T21:40:54.162+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's actually easy to hit 6 as the entire team if your junglers remember that respawn starts at 3:12 and STOPS CAMPING A LANE.","replies":[{"poster":"ApollyonBainer","date":"2018-12-29T00:53:02.543+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Cats Are Food,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=NGRniRpU,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2018-12-28T21:40:54.162+0000)\n>\n> It&#x27;s actually easy to hit 6 as the entire team if your junglers remember that respawn starts at 3:12 and STOPS CAMPING A LANE.\n\nTHANK YOU","replies":[{"poster":"Cats Are Food","date":"2018-12-29T03:04:58.809+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"No charge.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2018-12-28T21:55:52.079+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Cats Are Food,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=NGRniRpU,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2018-12-28T21:40:54.162+0000)\n>\n> It&#x27;s actually easy to hit 6 as the entire team if your junglers remember that respawn starts at 3:12 and STOPS CAMPING A LANE.\n\nBut if they do camp a lane? Judging by the caps, I'd guess that this has happened to you before, and perhaps the subsequent event saw your team eat a bunch of ults without being able to respond in kind.","replies":[{"poster":"Cats Are Food","date":"2018-12-28T22:10:07.793+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's happened to everybody before.  It's horribly common for the junglers to just abandon the jungle after the first clear, all the way until the first event.  When I jungle I clear, hit mid and bottom, and peel off to go clear again.

I said as much in the OP.\n\nMy point is that this advantage is too large for a forced confrontation.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Noor Sakata","date":"2018-12-28T22:45:08.905+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"People in Top lane \" or mid or whatever \" can reach level 6 easily , and even 7\nThe bot lane has 2 players an they usually level 5 , junglers are usually level 6 , when Something like that Duels fight starts , it's RNG , the level 5 bot laners might a level 7 top laner and a level 6 jungler which IS NOT fair at all , even if the same thing will happen to the enemies","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Noor Sakata","date":"2018-12-28T22:46:06.364+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah but nothing feels better than beng a level 5 Lee against 2 enemies when you are low hp , and they both level 6 , you kill one of them , level up , get ult and kill the second , I did it 3 times already and it feels so good tbh","replies":[]}]}
