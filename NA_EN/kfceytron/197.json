Even if they are good, you have to ask yourself \"but like, why?\"\n\nReworks of the scale of Ez or Tristana's are not too major.\nOne's like Eve's requires a bit of justification, but okay.\nTotal deletions like Aatrox's?  Should never happen.","replies":[{"poster":"ï¬‚oo","date":"2019-03-08T11:51:49.509+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Nunu and WW had bland designd, so did Kayle. Yes people become fond of them, but over time they become more and more useless or op due to simple buffs because of their simplicity.\n\nAatrox didn't need one either imo, but I can see how he also started to enter this category. His rework is definetly not the best solution as  slower riven with more healing.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GreenKnight","date":"2019-03-08T01:13:45.027+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SatomiKun,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=f4d6IXeB,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2019-03-08T01:09:37.002+0000)\n>\n> Seriously, dude, where is that hate for reworks coming from?\n> I understand that many of them have become balancing problems and all, but come on, they did some good ones.
