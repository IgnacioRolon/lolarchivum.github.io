I have no idea if it was streamed or not. If it was streamed and archived somewhere it would save me the trouble of uploading it myself (my goal was just to be able to show people this match). In fact, that's a good idea; I'm going to start digging and see if it exists anywhere. Want to help me look? :P","replies":[{"poster":"DuskDaUmbreon","date":"2018-11-18T06:00:06.045+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm...gonna pass on that. o.o","replies":[]}]}]}]}
