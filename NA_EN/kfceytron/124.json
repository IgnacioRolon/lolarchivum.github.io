I click the little &quot;X&quot; in the corner to close, and instead of taking me to the base menu for training in the &quot;Learn&quot; tab, it moves me to another tab. I go back to the &quot;Learn&quot; tab and there&#039;s the recap again. Nothing I do seems to get rid of the recap. I end up closing the client and restarting.\r\n\r\nTraining match as Sniper: during laning, all the enemy has to do is right-click me and they&#039;ll eventually catch up to me and kill me, whether I stay under my turret or retreat past it. My lane buddy AI flees into the jungle and joins the other bots in spamming Glyph recommendations (no idea). Remember when LoL had 5 functional bots, and being solo top meant that as soon as the two top lane AI saw you they would go for you, and you have to hide under turret? Same thing here, only the turrets aren&#039;t a threat. After about 20 minutes of being killed by deathball ganks, the enemy deathball decides to go down mid. Meanwhile, my allied bots decide to jungle. All four of them. At the same time. While the enemy is bulldozing mid. We lose.\r\n\r\nTraining match as Sniper, attempt 2: same nonsense laning phase where I&#039;m repeatedly killed with no counterplay, but I stay even farther away from the enemy than usual and manage to survive enough to buy items. I end up able to pretty much solo the enemy team, which is good, because one ally ends 6/4 and the others end 1/5, 1/7, and 1/9. Note that this is a training match, for new players. It comes shortly after a tutorial that tells you about right-clicking to move, and buying items at the shop (it doesn&#039;t mention the side shop or the secret shop). Now that you know how to move your hero, you&#039;re ready to go 23/5 and carry a team of feeders.\r\n\r\nThis time, I click &quot;X&quot; to close the recap and it works fine.\r\n\r\nAfter dealing with useless turrets, a buggy client, and a training mode that has surely never been tested by anyone but developers, it&#039;s starting to feel like LoL with all new champs and items. :)\r\n\r\nBut anyway, back to the title, Steam says I&#039;ve spent 34 hours playing Dota 2. I&#039;m just wondering when my dedication and perseverance will pay off and I&#039;ll actually start to have fun.","replies":[]}
