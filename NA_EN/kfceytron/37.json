Cull: kinda bland and generic.\r\n0. Mortal Reminder: so bland and generic that I forgot I was listening to it _while I was listening to it_ and only remembered to pay some attention to it after having basically missed 90% of it. These songs are reminding me of the occasional bits of stock metal sounds Jared Dines uses when he wants to show someone playing something.\r\n0. Tear of the Goddess: that vocalist is definitely not ZP, but the song itself is pretty okay. I do have to ask, though: how metal is it? Seemed more like rock, just on the heavy side, like Foo Fighters or Evanescence or something.\r\n0. Infinity Edge: these are starting to sound like a bunch of generic ads for items.\r\n0. Dead Man&#039;s Plate: okay, I guess.\r\n0. The Hex Core mk-2: I&#039;d call this industrial alt-rock.\r\n0. The Bloodthirster: HOLY SHIT I&#039;M NOT DISLIKING THIS ONE.\r\n0. Frozen Heart: starts out sounding like industrial metal, and then turns kinda dull, then a decent solo, then kinda meandering, but overall it&#039;s fine, I guess.\r\n0. Rapid Firecannon: I&#039;m writing this part before I hear a single note, just to say that there had better be some &quot;rapid&quot; shredding here. Or else! &gt;={ ... Okay, it does that right off the bat. Good. ... This one definitely gets my stamp of approval. It&#039;s good on its own, without even taking into account the fact that it was made as a side project for a video game.\r\n0. Blade of the Ruined King: okay, we get it, it says &quot;king&quot; in the item name, thanks for the orchestral stuff that kings obviously like. Fine. Great. If there was a Blade of the Ruined King dance, I&#039;m sure it would have moves like &quot;sit on throne&quot; and &quot;drop crown.&quot;","replies":[]}
