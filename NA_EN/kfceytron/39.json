Usually thats 2, but sometimes more. I assumed 5. So 5 thousand used the mistake.\nRiot also said in most regions less than 100 so... its save to assume 5 thousand is way bigger than the actuall number.\n\nLooking revenue 2017 (2.1 billion) \nand player base 2017 (82) we can calculate some interessting numbers.\nFirst. It isn't that many peopel profiting. its 0,006% thats roughly the ammount of challanger players in the world :D\nAlso the usual player spends 25,60 on skins... We assume riots revenue is solely based ion skin sales. This is wrong but makes it easier. I guess 90% are actally ingame purchases, but and the rest merch and 90% of the ingame stuff is capsules and lootboxes. So I guess its ok to assume this.\n\nWe find that further this roughly translates (we assume maximum dmg) that riot lost 13k in this incendent. Thats prolly not even the pay out for the janitor. So the dmg is really really low.\n\nThats why Riot wont have a whole person 40-60k per year) work in this for monthj to make sure everything is reverted but not to much. (Riot explained they would have to hand sift through all transactions to make sure nothing got forgotten or wrongly identified) sooo... yeah. Players are just greedy and out of touch\n\nwe all want free stuff, but there have been bigger fuckups. After all Riot reverted all the Bloodmoon skins since that was easy enough.\n\nAnd now what did the benficiaries actually get? Hundreds of skins they will never use since we all are OTP anyway... so yeah.
