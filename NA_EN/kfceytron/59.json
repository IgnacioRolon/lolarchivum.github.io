We load in, Ez goes bot, and I watch the other three briefly before I head top. They don't move, buy items, or chat. Shortly after minions spawn, the three other \"players\" suddenly buy items and run it down mid _at the exact same time_.\r\n\r\nhttps://i.imgur.com/KqZsDMN.png[]\r\n\r\nAnd I do mean \"run it down mid.\" They attack-move the enemy Nexus with the occasional few steps back for the rest of the game, and more than half of our team's deaths are executes. Fortunately, intro bots are even worse than beginner bots, and will often flat-out ignore you as they run under your turret, so these three \"players\" did manage to get a few kills between them.\r\n\r\nhttps://i.imgur.com/kT6PmgK.png[]\r\n\r\nEz never said anything, but I believe he is a human player who just picked up the game a few hours ago and has been playing it since that time. The other three \"players\" have been \"playing\" since yesterday, during which they \"played\" 19 games apiece. And - I guarantee you - if they keep \"playing,\" they will accrue about two dozen games per day, every day, as they \"play\" nonstop with no food or rest.\r\n\r\nBecause they are bots. You know, the problem Riot's new anti-cheat system was supposed to solve.\r\n\r\nThis is an abysmal impression for new players. You can air as many ridiculous ads as you want, but if a new player actually tries the game and finds that it's infested with scripters while the game itself has obvious bugs like the load screen incorrectly showing all bots with Cleanse/Smite, a single bot issuing all \"greetings\" at the beginning and end of the game, and more, they will leave. Players who leave don't spend money, and they don't tell their friends to spend money.\r\n\r\nTL;DR: The new player experience still sucks due to rampant bugs and scripters.","replies":[{"poster":"fire263","date":"2019-02-22T14:53:16.541+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have not met this problem yet, but this is definitely a big reason added to the already growing list of reasons on why new players don't have a good time playing this game. If Riot wants new players to play, they have to improve the quality of matchmaking at lower levels and fix a ton of problems such as what you just mentioned.\n\n- Smurfs are ruining the quality of games at the lower level by just completely destroying their enemies (Wish there was an option to identify as a smurf when you make a new account to help prevent this)\n- Despite update in tutorials, it still doesn't really teach the basics or how to play\n- Trolling smurfs that just flame new players constantly\n- Trolling smurfs just running it down for fun in order to make the game harder for new players who can't as easily beat the bots\n- And as you mentioned, now scripters running it down in bot games\\\n\nI don't really see how new players will enjoy the game with all these problems, and I hope they eventually fix a few of them. New players won't continue playing if the quality of their games are just straight up garbage.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Saezio","date":"2019-02-22T10:48:52.263+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why would anyone not play intermediate ?
