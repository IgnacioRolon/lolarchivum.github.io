Had a team with 3 adcs (including myself), a Vi, and an Amumu who built tank. \n\nI said don't go top since they had a Morg, Lux, Neeko, Zed (and something else I dont remember)... 3 of them ignored me and all ran top to int. \n\nProceeded to ?????????????????????????? me since I stayed botlane (the twitch who originally went mid moved top to help but ran off since they all died).\n\nFollowed by flaming, the tank Amumu constantly pinging my build since I built Bloodthirster before Infinity Edge (my kda was way higher than his), the Vi telling everyone to report me for trolling ( her kda was slightly better) and Jhin spamming ??? (he was like 2/11). The Twitch was ok though.\n\nFun times, especially since the Vi jungle said \"not ganking u cait.\" left me to 2v1 against Morg and Zed for a good portion of the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-03-09T06:35:15.800+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm bored enough to be doing it again right now. \"--ssies\"... \"small brain team\"... \"I WANTED TEEMO U ----SUCKER, I'M FEEDING /all OPEN BOT FREE KILLS\"... Whether we win (AFK on enemy team) or lose (team decides to hate each other because reasons), I'm seeing why toxicity is such a popular issue. I only see this kind of behavior once or twice in a year in co-op, but it's been just about every game in PvP.","replies":[]}]}
