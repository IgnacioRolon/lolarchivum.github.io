Would he use the same builds he does now and just try to weave in more autos? Would he switch to his old standby, the full AP build? Would the game overall be in a better place? Worse?","replies":[{"poster":"letsfeedtogether","date":"2019-06-20T10:23:42.200+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"\"What if Ez Q no longer applied on-hits?\" \n\nhe will be useless","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-06-20T10:43:15.139+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=letsfeedtogether,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=n4duKhWg,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2019-06-20T10:23:42.200+0000)\n>\n> \"What if Ez Q no longer applied on-hits?\" \n> \n> he will be useless\n\nMaybe he could then be balanced around mechanics that don't warp the game?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Chembaron Yamada","date":"2019-06-20T11:25:09.033+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"What will happen:\n\n1. Ezreal will lose his niche\n2. Will become insanely weak\n\nWhile you could buff him to make him stronger again, losing his niche is still a big deal. If this is gone, then he build like every other ADC in the game and there is actually not much reason left anymore to ever pick him... He would probably just end up being a weaker Caitlyn.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kirika","date":"2019-06-20T14:49:53.771+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I actually think he was in a good spot with double tear. He needed a lot of time but was very good late game. Now he is meh lategame but okayish midgame. Still better than before his w changes. Made him more like he used to be in old times where he was full hybrid.\nI just dont get why people hate him so much. Most of the adc have an easy long range finisher to deal with his slippery escape.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Daddy Ants","date":"2019-06-20T11:28:31.311+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Melee only Iceborn Gauntlet\n\nKarma top is killed.\nGauntlet abusing Ezreal is killed.\n\nEzreal wants a sheen item?

Its the same as always: Dodge the skillshot and you dont get slowed. The only thing unhealthy here is your way of thinking. Ezreals niche is that he is a AD Caster. You take the ability to use on hit effects and he becomes the absolute worst \"adc\" in the game. The Double Tear nerf hit him hard already.","replies":[{"poster":"The thigh guy","date":"2019-06-20T14:43:46.955+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Kirika,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=n4duKhWg,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2019-06-20T13:01:48.871+0000)\n>\n> Why is he abusing the Item now?
