To reproduce, simply use Demolish on a turret in Practice Tool while Tower Invulnerability is turned on.

Checking the damage of a tower-only rune makes sense, too. \n\nIt's way more niche that you'd have a bot in the game _and_ not want towers destroyed, _and_ not be killing the bot, _and_ that it's even a bot with Demolish.","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-02-04T00:06:49.514+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=DeceasedL0ved0ne,realm=NA,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=Qfme79eI,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2019-02-03T20:55:09.058+0000)\n>\n> Where does it say the whole purpose is to prevent towers from being destroyed?

I think that's a bug.\n\nI'm not going to argue with you about what people want to do, but you can check the damage contribution from Demolish by hitting a tower normally and then with Demolish, and then doing some subtraction. It's not nearly as easy to allow a tanky bot to gain exp/gold without taking down turrets.","replies":[{"poster":"The Ecdysiast","date":"2019-02-04T21:23:16.919+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=KFCeytron,realm=NA,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=Qfme79eI,comment-id=0000000000000000,timestamp=2019-02-04T00:06:49.514+0000)\n>\n> The toggle is named &quot;Toggle Towers Invincible&quot; but the towers are not invincible.
