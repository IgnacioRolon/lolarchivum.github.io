It evens the scales, a bit like Irelia&#039;s old slow/stun that punished enemies for doing well and therefore had to be removed. Balloon minions, however, are just [found cake](https://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2005/07/29/it-looks-delicious) for Zoe to pick up off the ground. Where did those minions even get those balloons? Why carry the things and then not use them? It doesn&#039;t make any sense. Minions should simply use these abilities as a Hail Mary right before/as they die - prioritizing Zoe if available - and dropping them on the ground for her to pick up as normal. Redemption would automatically target the minion&#039;s lowest-health ally in range, Ignite would get cast on the minion&#039;s nearest enemy, TP would briefly grant the minion Undying Rage so that a super minion could TP to it, Gunblade would automatically shoot someone in the face, and so on. If the ability can&#039;t find an appropriate target, it doesn&#039;t drop.\r\n\r\nAs an example of the new risk/reward balance, Zoe might end a fight at low health, then have to decide between killing a nearby balloon minion for a potential Heal or keeping her distance as it dies just in case it Ignites her.","replies":[{"poster":"Dope Solo","date":"2018-08-06T15:06:01.498+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I hated the balloon mechanic from the moment I saw it.
