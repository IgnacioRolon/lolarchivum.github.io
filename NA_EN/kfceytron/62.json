For example, a user of a service may write a check greater than their bill, or the service's automated system might bill a user for an incorrect amount (a guy in NY got a $38m utility bill this year, a woman in Pennsylvania got a $284B utility bill a couple years ago, etc.). The human who notices the error can then contact the human support system - which has much more sophisticated \"programming\" than any computer - and correct the problem.\n\nSupport tickets are still available (I presume) to correct the error of not reporting after a game, whether due to forgetfulness, a crash, etc. However, they are no longer available to correct the error of the IFS somehow letting the most blatantly obvious, clearly poor behavior go unpunished, as used to be possible. I think this is detrimental to the playerbase overall, for the reasons I outlined in my OP.\n\nThe rest of your post relies wholly on the massive assumption that ticketers are largely just malicious, angry, arrogant people who misuse the system. I've seen many banned players post their conversations with Riot support on PB about supposed false positives, where they interact with multiple people who each independently confirm that the player's behavior was inappropriate, and eventually end up getting their tickets automatically closed. Why should players on the _receiving_ end of such inappropriate behavior not even be allowed to open a ticket about false negatives? It just gives the impression that when the automated system is asleep on the job, there's no supervisor to wake them up.","replies":[{"poster":"TrulyBland","date":"2019-11-14T11:36:23.587+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Okay, since you clearly misunderstand my post, let me be as concise as possible:\n\nWhy should Riot believe that a report via ticket is more reliable than an ingame report?","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-11-14T20:12:49.641+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=TrulyBland,realm=EUNE,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=q7uGWEvI,comment-id=000900000000,timestamp=2019-11-14T11:36:23.587+0000)\n>\n> Okay, since you clearly misunderstand my post, let me be as concise as possible:\n> \n> Why should Riot believe that a report via ticket is more reliable than an ingame report?\n\nBy reading it and making a judgment call about its validity, of course.\n\nUnless by \"a report\" you meant \"every report\" - believing that every report from one source is always better than every report from another source would obviously be a gross misconception.","replies":[{"poster":"TrulyBland","date":"2019-11-14T20:50:08.970+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=KFCeytron,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=q7uGWEvI,comment-id=0009000000000000,timestamp=2019-11-14T20:12:49.641+0000)\n>\n> By reading it and making a judgment call about its validity, of course.\n\nThat's already more of an effort than regular reports get.
