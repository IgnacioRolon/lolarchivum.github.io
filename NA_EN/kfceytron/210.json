It's criticism to these threads listing all of a champions strenghts and then claiming they are OP and \"overloaded\" when that term is meaningless just like their opinion. And no, you're wrong. It still offers all of these things, because context doesn't matter, right? We're listing what is inside a champion's kit after all. This was a single ability, which I compared to Annie's total kit for the sake of highlighting how dumb the premise is.\n\nI'm only listing effects:\nAnnie\nPassive: 1 Stun\nQ: Mana refund\nW: pbAoEwith no effect itself\nE: Damage mitigation + Movement speed (and damage mitigation) for Tibbers\nR: AoE with tiny cast time, long duration and minion that can be fast and auto attack for 100 damage each. Potential for a Flash Aoe Stun, but still useful without Flash.\n\nThat's pathetic, yet she works fine as a champion. I'll give it to you that thanks to the added utility on Annie's E and R the raw number of effects is indeed higher than Neeko's ult alone, but once you take a second ability into the mix she still vastly outnumbers her on that front.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nausicäa ","date":"2019-01-29T12:53:40.939+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This comment is so insanely stupid I just dont even know what to say.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BlackEtherian","date":"2019-01-29T16:36:15.319+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Snake of Avarice,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=k7OUHmTF,comment-id=000200000000,timestamp=2019-01-28T19:44:22.503+0000)\n>\n> I get downvoted for this, yet anybody still has to prove me wrong.\n> \n> Neeko ult alone has \n> -a shield\n> -can move/flash during it\n> -HUGE damage\n> -HUGE ratio\n> -HUGE AoE\n> -stuns every target hit\n> \n> that alone is the entire kit of Annie in a single ability.\n\nAnnie is old and needs a rework, next.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BlackEtherian","date":"2019-01-29T16:16:41.940+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Snake of Avarice,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=k7OUHmTF,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2019-01-28T16:44:42.280+0000)\n>\n> Here&#x27;s something that might shock you: Neeko ult is extremely overloaded, yet you don&#x27;t complain about her and even say she is okay.

It's just that people who call foul generally are louder and more prolific than the people who actually try out the champs, assess their strengths and weaknesses, and then learn to counterplay them.\n\nThere's a reason why most \"OP New champs\" don't have high win rates; Even if on a micro level, their kits duel well and are hard to react to, the tradeoff is they do not have an impression on their game's success on a macro level. That's why even with a double Siphoning Strike, Nasus really hasn't changed much. He's still a single target champion who only gains as much as one auto attack will let him. In contrast, more successful champs have aoes, faster move speeds in their builds, and can get away from a lane to help their teams.\n\nPyke is also a single target champion who on a micro level performs \"well\" on the surface. But, when you break down what he actually does, his statistics do not support his KDAs. He is essentially a \"finisher\" 90% of the time, and only 10% duel. His kit has some of the lowest damage output in the game, only hits once per skill, the CC is brief, and much of it is easy to mitigate. So, most Pykes just wait around for teammates to start fights, and help finish those fights at less than 30-20% HP. He may have a good KDA, but generally underperforms in objectives, actual damage, and even CC, because his Q has conditions, he is easy to kill, and E doesn't happen enough to champions per game.\n\nZoe was never at any point broken. In fact her win rate only went up after her 4th nerf, which moved some of her E and Passive damage into her W, and gave her a higher level 1 move speed on W, drastically reducing her Q/E damage output in the process. (I had a team last night that just kept stepping right on her Bubbles after they had been on the ground 1-1.5 seconds, who we had to block the shot for so many times, but that doesn't make her broken; that makes my teammates stupid).

That's the opponents Risking a Zhonya's into a mechanic they SHOULD KNOW. Her E rarely ever gets its full duration root, and her Q is easy to walk out of, and each hit is smaller than the average mage's hits.\n\nHave you also noticed, that other than Pyke, all these champs have a really low play rate?

At that point, the only major change was the removal of her E's cooldown reduction. Her nerfs \"to the ground\" - her conversion of sleep into a Cleanse/QSS/Tenacity CC was after that, as was her reallocation of damage.\n\n2) Her R can miss and is pretty easy to predict. It's her 3 X Reset on Q that carries her into a destructive pattern along with Steraks. Before the Sterak's she's manageable. But when she has that shield PLUS her Q's heals, she basically heals up while shielded and friggin resets the fight to where it began. If she's shut down, you can delay that Steraks, and she becomes more manageable.\n\n3) Nah. There's more factors on aggregate at high elo than just how someone feels about a champion (or at least for me). It's about reducing the game to champs who can be caught, don't reset, and are easy to force into a position where your team can push their base without them being able to stop it. These new mobility champs throw a wrench into that basic concept, because they avert more punishment, have many resets, and just take too much time to deal with. Just think about how long it takes to kill a good Yasuo, vs the risk/reward for doing so. Personally, I can counter Yasuo with Zyra in DII, but it's still a really annoying matchup, because the extra 10-12 seconds I'm fighting Yasuo reduces my presence elsewhere, or pushing a turret. it's MUCH easier if they run a Veigar or Karthus, and I can just pop them.

You can win a lane with a nonmeta champ, but you still have to be building something viable. And winning a lane doesn't mean winning the game, because smurfing doesn't address the potential feed advantage your team gives the other team. If you're playing Blitz Top, building him AP or AD, and your team is losing mid 0/6 and bot lane 1/12, and your jungler is just \"jungling\" the entire game, your options to win are still finite. Blitz specifically usually gets singled out, and if he DOES miss a hook, he's usually a sitting duck for awhile. A fed other team can still win that, and his kit doesn't have resets or serious aoe presence.\n\nSmurfs who want to win smurfing stick to reset champs like Irelia, Jax, Kha Zix, Jarvan, Lee Sin, Katarina, Fiora, or high scaling assassins like Talon or Zed these days.
