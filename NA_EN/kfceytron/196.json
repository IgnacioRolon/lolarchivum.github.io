It's random (well, pRNG) with replacement. It is actually very random.\r\n\r\nBut I suspect that I'm not the only ARAM player who plays ARAM for the variety and unpredictability, and long ago tired of getting handed the same champs day in day out. For example, today I got Soraka twice in a row, then Cait twice in a row. A while back I got Kalista three times in a row. And I frequently get Amumu, Sej, and Singed, while I almost never get Lux. I don't think I've ever gotten Sion, and I do own him. I haven't even _seen_ him. That's very statistically unlikely, but it's not impossible, because ARAM is random (unless Sion is hard-coded to be excluded from ARAM from some reason I'm not aware of).\r\n\r\nNote that I'm not talking about rerolls and dodges, although those do tend to push the champs I see toward a certain pool of stronger ARAM champs. I'm also not talking about getting an unbalanced team with too many of one champ class and not enough of another, like an all-AD team when the enemy has Rammus (I played such a match once, as the Rammus... yes, we won). Mitigating or dampening these issues might make one-sided ARAM matches a bit less frequent, but those matches - annoying as they may be for the team who lost at champ select - don't violate the spirit of ARAM.\r\n\r\nI think that transitioning away from pure randomness - maybe playing a champ removes it from your pool for a few matches or days, or selection is random _without_ replacement, or a random champ is selected from a different class (marksman, support, etc.) each game - would make the mode more interesting and fun.\r\n\r\nhttps://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/im_so_random.png\r\n\r\n> In retrospect, it's weird that as a kid I thought completely random outbursts made me seem interesting, given that from an information theory point of view, lexical white noise is just about the opposite of interesting by definition.","replies":[{"poster":"G0blinSlay3r","date":"2019-10-08T06:43:09.264+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Patterned RNG.. riot literally knows what it will spit out next.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HarrowÃ¯ng","date":"2019-10-08T05:39:22.577+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"i think i've played Ryze 5 times in the last 10 arams i played lol","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-10-08T05:28:17.587+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"ARAM is not purely random to begin with, it is blatantly weighted towards certain sorts of comps and certain champions (based on your history).\n\nI cant even guess at how many times i have gotten a long streak where out of 10 games, i had the same champion in 5. _Incredibly_ improbable, but it happens pretty often.

Any outcome is mathematically possible in a random system. If you peer into the black box and see a non-random mechanism, then yes, you could deny that such a system is random, but such a denial is not possible judging only by the results.\n\nAnd I think I would rather believe that ARAM is truly random with odd results rather than that Riot intentionally gives us the same champions over and over again in an ostensibly random mode. For my sanity. :)","replies":[]}]}]}
