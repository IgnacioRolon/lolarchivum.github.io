Whether it's building a house to live in, building a house out of sugar packets, fixing that squeak in your chair, eating soup without dripping a single drop, solving world hunger, or anything else you can think of, seeing your actions have the desired effect on the world around you feels great. When your actions have no effect on the world around you, that feels bad, especially when the result is the opposite of what you're going for.\r\n\r\n\"I was trying to make X happen, and X happened\" = good\r\n\r\n\"I was trying to make X happen, and X didn't happen\" = bad\r\n\r\n\"I was trying to make X happen, and the opposite of X happened\" = very bad\r\n\r\nWhen you go into a LoL match and do your best to farm correctly, get kills, and steal dragons, and you win, it feels great, because you're controlling your environment. You were trying to make that happen, and it did. When you try your best to win and yet you lose, it feels terrible. People who AFK, int, grief, etc. have simply changed their goal from winning to losing. This new goal is much easier to achieve as it's a 6v4, so now they can control their environment and be happy.\r\n\r\nThe problem, of course, is that this joy comes at the expense of everyone else who's still trying to control their environment by winning the game. And for people who can't win but also can't be happy while angering teammates, there _is_ no way to control their environment and be happy while playing LoL.","replies":[]}
