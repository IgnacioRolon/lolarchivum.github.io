They queue up, get placed, Akali is banned, someone dodges. Queue pops again, Akali not banned, Akali makes it through, and someone else dodges. Queue pops again, Akali banned, and a teammate who&#039;d been expressing interest in Zilean finally gets Zilean... and someone dodges. Queue pops again, Akali is banned again, and Mr. Hypothetical decides to ban Zilean, to troll the person who wanted Zilean and had been banning Mundo because he&#039;s hated Mundo for years. And then Mr. Hypothetical troll picks Sona, it goes through, and we get destroyed - I mean, Mr. Hypothetical&#039;s team gets destroyed - by a bruiser.\r\n\r\nHypothetically.\r\n\r\nOFA is a blind pick, and the comp is a monad. There&#039;s no strategy in the pick/ban, and all it means is that someone wants to play a certain champ in OFA (and not play against certain champs). Why not just matchmake by bans and picks, the same way that people who want ranked can just queue for that instead of being put with people who want co-op and then voting on the mode?","replies":[]}
