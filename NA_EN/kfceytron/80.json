When I pick Ziggs in Odyssey and I&#039;m the only one in the match, the border shows up. When there&#039;s another Ziggs on my team, the border is absent. I don&#039;t know if the other Ziggs has to be on the same team for this to happen, if this happens with other skins that have borders, if this happens when all the Ziggs have borders, and so on, due to testing limitations.","replies":[]}
