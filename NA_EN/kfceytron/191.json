INTO THE FRAY!","subforum":"General Discussion","up_votes":8,"down_votes":5,"body":"https://i.imgur.com/ecuQBkH.png[]\r\n\r\nAs we all know, there are no veins or arteries in the thighs, there are no vital organs in the abdominal area, and a ribcage is all the protection a warrior needs to keep their heart and lungs safe while they engage in armed melee combat. Therefore, the only necessary protection for those areas is _**~~magical LYCRAÂ®~~**_, which has the added bonus of looking hot AF so Kayle can pull her weight in the revenue department. Plus, it also paves the way for base skin chromas like Yoga Pants Kayle and Pajama Party Kayle (both Prestige, of course).\r\n\r\nSo go, Kayle! Forward! An eye for an eye! Your old armor was just holding you back. Now that you are clad primarily in stretchy fabric so thin that it's implemented as a texture of your bare skin, your enemies will know they're in the wrong league.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n######P.S.: thigh hips.","replies":[]}
