Just facts.","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wait for everyone to call something and then I fill, as I always do. Game starts and our team is actually doing quite well. Five minutes later, our support&#039;s Internet messes up and he does nothing but disconnect/reconnect every 30 seconds or so for the rest of the match to the point that the announcements are getting on my nerves. The enemy Yi gets fed off of every other lane but mine (I&#039;m Kog ADC, all by myself due to the support&#039;s Internet issues, but the enemy Janna/Maokai bot lane is just biding their time until Yi shows up). Our mid quietly gives up and leaves. Our top has a latency of nearly three full seconds, but manages to stay connected. Enemy team asks in all chat what happened to our support, and we inform them that he is having Internet problems. A few minutes later, the Yi (fed off of everyone but me) starts trash talking. My remaining teammates trash talk back.\r\n\r\nAfter nearly half an hour of this, I&#039;m 6/3/2 with the most champ damage in the game, my team is 24/22, the enemy Yi is 14/4 plus every dragon that spawned, and we surrender 3/0.","replies":[{"poster":"WÃ¸Oxer","date":"2018-11-12T11:57:37.891+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Matchmaking coinflip which you lost.","replies":[]}]}
