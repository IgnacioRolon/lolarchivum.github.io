We want champions to be able to opt into resisting poke patterns, but it should take more of a durability investment than just Warmog&#039;s Armor to do so.\n\nThe health threshold makes this not just a tank item, but a health tank item. You need to specifically acquire health, not just &quot;tank items.&quot; Your &quot;durability investment&quot; needs to be health items. Why should items like Stoneplate, or even intermediate items like Chain Vest, not be considered an investment into tanky items that increase your durability? Why should Cho reach the threshold sooner with his ult, but not Garen with his W (I&#039;m still mad that mechanic has a stack limit, unlike those of other stacking champs, but whatever)? Hybrid items like Cleaver count towards the threshold, but another hybrid item like Veil doesn&#039;t?\n\nGive armor and MR an appropriate weight for their gold cost and item budget, and then include them in the Warmog&#039;s activation threshold. The threshold can then be adjusted for actual durability rather than just health values.\n\nN.B.: I am assuming that Warmog&#039;s is a healthy item rather than being kept intentionally weak to prevent people from using it and messing up games, like old Urgot.","replies":[{"poster":"RookPusher","date":"2018-07-30T21:07:56.056+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd love to respond but I'm not sure what you're saying here.

Critmaster Garen suggested above that there could a health requirement AND a resistance requirement to give room for buffs, but I think that simply including more defensive stats into the calculation would be a good start. Say they go with 8:1 - you could then build 2000 health, 80 MR, and 45 armor to reach the threshold (2000 + 80\\*8 + 45\\*8 = 3000).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Critmaster Garen","date":"2018-07-30T21:15:43.081+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hmm. interesting. id be fine with an even higher threshold, giving it a health and resistance requirement (3000 health, 100 armor and mr), if theyd buff the damn thing.\n\nit used to be the big health item, that youd pick up if you just wanted a large amount of raw health.\n\nthey could remove the regen passive and make it increase your bonus health by 10% instead.\n\njust give us a version of warmogs back that gives us more than 1k health again.\n\nor put a {{champion:106}} passive on it and have it heal us for a 30% of our maximum health over a couple seconds, when we fall below a certain threshold like 30% health. that would be cool too.","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2018-07-30T23:51:13.902+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Critmaster Garen,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=KFrHXlcQ,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2018-07-30T21:15:43.081+0000)\n>\n> hmm. interesting. id be fine with an even higher threshold, giving it a health and resistance requirement (3000 health, 100 armor and mr), if theyd buff the damn thing.\n> \n> it used to be the big health item, that youd pick up if you just wanted a large amount of raw health.\n> \n> they could remove the regen passive and make it increase your bonus health by 10% instead.\n> \n> just give us a version of warmogs back that gives us more than 1k health again.\n> \n> or put a {{champion:106}} passive on it and have it heal us for a 30% of our maximum health over a couple seconds, when we fall below a certain threshold like 30% health. that would be cool too.\n\nThat's the main problem I'm worried about: I don't know whether Riot wants people to build it. I'm fine with the idea of a multiplicative item that works better on top of other items, but at the moment it's specifically a health tank item rather than simply a tank item, in the same way that IE is specifically a crit ADC item while Deathcap is simply a mage item.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"mzicio","date":"2018-07-31T12:55:09.408+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Imagine the interaction with Sejuani's passive, kek","replies":[]}]}
