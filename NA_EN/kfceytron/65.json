Be careful.","subforum":"General Discussion","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I chomped a pizza fresh out of the oven yesterday, and I could tell it was hot, but I kept at it. Within less than a minute, I felt the surface of the roof of my mouth peeling away, and soon I was spitting blood. Even today, there&#039;s still pain and major visible damage.\r\n\r\nThe threshold at which food will feel too painfully hot to eat (making you spit it out) is a lot higher than the point at which food can burn your mouth. This creates a dangerous window where food will seem okay to eat and yet be capable of injuring you, and this window grows as your hunger increases. I&#039;m not telling you to wait until every meal is stone cold, but do keep in mind that &quot;just barely cool enough&quot; doesn&#039;t cut it.","replies":[]}
