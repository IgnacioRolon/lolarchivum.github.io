Lots of people who play games (in general) , stop playing (because of personal reasons), then come back after a few months (or years). Sometimes all it takes is an ad highlighting that the game is still alive, or that there's an update to get them to come back.\n\nCoke and Pepsi do this kind of \"hey just a reminder we're still here\" type of advertising a lot. They're not trying to introduce you to the flavors or the benefits of drinking their product, the ad is just something crazy and attention grabbing and then the logo appears when you look. The \"brand reinforcement\" ads aren't meant to draw in new consumers, just to snag the attention and bring back (or keep) the older ones.\n\nBut like. The WoW one is kinda nostalgic to the \"horde vs alliance faction pride\" that a lot of players remember contributing to. The league one is trying to draw some parallel with basketball (and I guess anime), which doesn't really incite any emotion.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Riot Scathlocke","date":"2018-10-27T04:17:28.068+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":3,"body":"Wait, what?
