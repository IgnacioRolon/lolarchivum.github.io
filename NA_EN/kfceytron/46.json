I can still navigate with Tab to e.g. type in chat, but the only buttons I can actually click are the ones in the title bar (help, minimize, settings, exit). The only way to fix it that I've found is to exit and restart the client, which of course makes it impossible to e.g. report a player.\r\n\r\nThis is happening consistently.","replies":[]}
