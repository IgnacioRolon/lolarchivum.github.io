In the old client (before Dynamic Queue, anyway), there was a little spot at the bottom right of the homepage with live matches. Now if I want to see a match I have to continually toggle between ranked categories and scroll through literally thousands of names looking for the \"eye\" icon. It would be nice if we could filter each list to show only the players currently in a match, or, better yet, have a single consolidated area that lists any player from any category/tier who is currently in a match.","replies":[]}
