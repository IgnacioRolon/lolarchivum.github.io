Including something means that it&#039;s going to be part of whatever you&#039;re talking about. Excluding something means it _won&#039;t_ be.\r\n\r\nFor example, let&#039;s say someone has planned a picnic for Mother&#039;s Day.\r\n\r\nInclusion: &quot;Enjoy the picnic, Mom!&quot;\r\nExclusion: &quot;Go away, Dad. This is Mom&#039;s picnic.&quot;\r\n\r\nOr maybe someone is mailing out a newsletter.\r\n\r\nInclusion: &quot;Let&#039;s make sure we remember the addressees whose names start with Mc and Mac.&quot;\r\nExclusion: &quot;Remove addressees whose names start with L.&quot;\r\n\r\nProgramming a data structure:\r\n\r\nInclusion: &quot;I&#039;ll import a parallel processing library so I can speed up matrix multiplication.&quot;\r\nExclusion: &quot;I&#039;ll comment out the code that detects infinite recursion.&quot;\r\n\r\nPerhaps someone wants to state that they enjoy eating fruits.\r\n\r\nInclusion: &quot;I love oranges!&quot;\r\nExclusion: &quot;Apples are yucky.&quot;\r\n\r\nBeing multilingual:\r\n\r\nInclusion: &quot;This film has Spanish subtitles.&quot;\r\nExclusion: &quot;This film&#039;s English audio track has been removed.&quot;\r\n\r\nBalancing a raid:\r\n\r\nInclusion: &quot;Fire mages are now able to damage the red dragon.&quot;\r\nExclusion: &quot;Dragons are now immune to Frost damage.&quot;\r\n\r\nAnd, finally, there is a difference between inclusion and exclusion when dealing with gender discrimination.\r\n\r\nInclusion: &quot;Women are encouraged to join this event.&quot;\r\nExclusion: &quot;Men are forbidden from joining this event.&quot;","replies":[]}
