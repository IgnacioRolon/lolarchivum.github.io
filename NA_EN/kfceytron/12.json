Pure copy-paste should be perfectly acceptable wherever it suffices.

When I see a claim/question that I don't yet have an answer for but can see myself answering more than once in the future, I'll write up a new one and save it. Actually, I try to write my copy-paste answers without a specific post in mind, which lets me focus on the topic itself, avoid overly-harsh verbiage (e.g. \"Riot isn't interested in retaining players with this sort of behavior\" rather than \"Riot doesn't want you here\"), and produce something reusable.","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2019-08-27T15:31:39.464+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=KFCeytron,realm=NA,application-id=6heBIhQc,discussion-id=AfLTwqxj,comment-id=0000000000000000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2019-08-27T15:28:39.568+0000)That sounds like... just really bad copy-paste.\n\nAnd when a problem becomes widespread enough, we put in rules about it.
