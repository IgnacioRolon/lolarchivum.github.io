Blue team's [mid laner](https://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/3287952025/2111041161964096?tab=overview) is literally ranked number five in the entire continent. And do you know what happened? Blue team got about half a dozen kills by 8 minutes, compared to Red team's one.\r\n\r\nRed team gave up. A couple disconnected outright, the rest danced in the fountain while occasionally venturing out to be obliterated. Every lane open.\r\n\r\nWhen the Red team's Nexus exploded, the timer read 13:55. For reference, turret plating falls at 14:00, and early surrender is an option at 15:00.\r\n\r\n\"13:55\" is a fucking fake game length. It was over in five minutes. Everyone could tell, and I don't blame the losing team for \"giving up.\" It's not their failure, it's Riot's. At that level of play, beating a slightly more skilled team is hard enough; doing so at a massive numerical disadvantage is basically impossible.\r\n\r\nI'm sure you've all seen some of those sports movies where the main character(s) are having a tough time against their rival team, but the coach gives an inspiring speech, or the star player sees his girlfriend in the stands, or [♪ up-tempo rock music ♪] starts playing, and this allows them to close the gap and perhaps even pull ahead to win by one point? Yeah, that wouldn't happen in a movie about a LoL tournament. The coach would be like \"I know you're worried about [minor subplot], but you can do this! You're better than those guys!\" and the players would be like \"okay, maybe that's true, but those guys now have a lead of 1.5 items and 3 levels. Each.\" That would be a shitty not-a-real-sport movie, because LoL isn't a real sport, and it isn't even trying to be a good game anymore.\r\n\r\nSnowballing has always been a factor, but I think it's getting worse, and Riot thinks that game \"length\" and comeback mechanics tell the whole story.\r\n\r\nSorry about the wall of text. I'm just disappointed in the path Riot's taking for LoL's design. :(","replies":[]}
