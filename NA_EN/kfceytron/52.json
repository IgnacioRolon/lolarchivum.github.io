Article is slightly more authoritative than your statement.\n\nFrom the article\n\n> But according one of the more popular theories, it might have to do with how **middle- and upper-class** European women used to dress...\n\nEmphasis mine. It goes on:\n\n> During historical periods like the Renaissance and the Victorian Era, **women’s clothing was often much more complicated and elaborate** than men’s - think petticoats, corsets and bustles. But while rich men often dressed themselves, their **female family members most likely had servants to help them put on their clothes**, both out of luxury and necessity. **To make it easier for servants** to button up their employer’s dresses right, clothiers might have started sewing buttons on the opposite side. Eventually, as clothing became more and more mass-produced, women’s clothes kept being made with the buttons of the left, and the design became standard..\n\nBeing made to help servants of higher class individuals is classist.\n\nOne could also argue that it is discriminatory to the left-handed, since everything was made, catered to the right-handed.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Bansheenoir","date":"2018-11-05T08:09:32.663+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":6,"body":"Wait... mods ACTUALLY do their jobs!?!?!?","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2018-11-05T12:35:39.348+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Bansheenoir,realm=NA,application-id=6heBIhQc,discussion-id=GRLUxnLm,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2018-11-05T08:09:32.663+0000)\n>\n> Wait... mods ACTUALLY do their jobs!?!?!?\n\nYep!
