How does this happen? Is there a rune or item or meta strategy that increases exp gain?","replies":[{"poster":"Ryelic","date":"2019-06-26T02:16:47.916+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, ADC and support naturally get xp slower than other roles because they have to share. It's fairly normal for the other lanes to be a number of levels ahead, especially if they get picks/don't die.\n\nJust the nature of the beast, I'm afraid.","replies":[{"poster":"Katareener","date":"2019-06-26T05:37:58.176+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Exactly this. As a mid laner I often rely on hitting lv 6 before bot lane to make an early play before the enemy bot lane  gets their ultimates.","replies":[]}]}]}
