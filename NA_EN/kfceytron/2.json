Now I see... different items than described in that page. The \"Call Me! Animated Emote for 200 Tokens\" is now available as the \"Call Me! ~~Animated~~ Emote for ~~200~~ 150 Tokens\" and the \"Think About It Animated Emote for 150 Tokens\" is now available as the \"Think About It ~~Animated~~ Emote for 150 Tokens.\"\r\n\r\nWTF happened? Was there some kind of development issue that forced them to be delayed and then downgraded? Why do they still cost as much as the animated Arcade emotes (150 tokens each) rather than having their price reduced to that of the static  Arcade emote (75 tokens)? Or was the news page wrong about that 200-token cost while the shop is wrong about them not being animated?","replies":[]}
