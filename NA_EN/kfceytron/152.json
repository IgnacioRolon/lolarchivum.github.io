Wasn't happening before the last patch, so the obvious solution is to revert the patch. Anyone want to guess the likelihood of rotroi actually doing that? Hint: it's zero. I don't recall a patch having ever actually been reverted, even when it literally breaks the game.\r\n\r\nThanks for the free loss last game, Rito. It was fun going into a crucial late-game teamfight, having the game nope.jpg outta there, and then hearing \"EnEmY pEnTaKiLL\" before I can alt-tab back in because damage is still that high. I can't wait to play all your other fully quality assured games with thoroughly tested patches with no regressions. Just kidding; you don't know what any of those words mean.","replies":[]}
