So people wouldn't get bored of it on PBE and figure out the best strat. PBE really only tests for major bugs because everyone who plays PBE sucks so you can't test balance excluding some real ridiculous stuff. I mean look at Skarner rework like how was that not caught. So I dont think it is the same thing because also some champions are super easy and you don't need to play them prior to know how to play them well enough in ranked.","replies":[]}]}
