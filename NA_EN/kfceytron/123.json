Constructive, courteous criticism is encouraged: for example, telling someone about a new way they can use an ability, like using Aatrox's E during a Q cast, or recommending a specific item, like Adaptive Helm when facing a DoT champion.\r\n\r\nBut... have you tried doing that? Does the person receiving your friendly and respectful advice actually listen to you? Lately I've noticed that it doesn't seem to work, mostly when encountering people who stick to recommended items with no thought to strategy, viz, stacking armor when the enemy team is literally five mages. When I see what these people build, I try to give my advice in a casual, offhand manner calculated to spark the least possible ire. \"btw, you could sell those tabi and buy merc's; they have 5 mages with heavy cc.\" I get literally no response. No \"I don't believe you,\" no \"I don't understand,\" no \"gtfo i h8 u,\" nothing. It's like I'm not even there.\r\n\r\nPolite, constructive criticism is better than flame with no actionable advice, but is \"better\" enough? Is it actually effective?","replies":[{"poster":"Icy Hot Shoto","date":"2019-04-15T05:16:41.402+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've actually had people 'respond better' to constructive criticism more than having people yell at them about it. Either they thank me, or they don't say anything at all and either listen to my suggestion or not bother.\n\nOf course, their will always be those people who don't want to hear it at all. But they're not that common that I've seen. And usually, from what I've seen, those who aren't going to listen usually show their toxic and don't care before you can even suggest something to them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"EvilDustMan","date":"2019-04-15T13:16:34.500+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not always effective, no. But you also have to relinquish the concept you can control your teammates. It is more LIKELY to be effective and less LIKELY to cause flame spirals. There are still lots of parameters to the situation you don't know and can't control.\n\nIt's more optimal, but not guaranteed by any means.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Judgementhascome","date":"2019-04-15T09:58:50.382+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Constructive criticism is always going to be a 50-50 type ordeal to individuals. I say that due to the fact that some people; even viewed as constructive, view it as you criticizing them and some do not like admitting to their own faults especially some random stranger pointing it out but that's just because their ego is in play. I don't mind receiving constructive criticism because it shows me what I'm doing wrong and how to go from there and improve. I also don't mind giving people constructive criticism because I am trying to help them but majority of the time, you will get people that just ignore you and just keep doing what they're doing because they can't admit they're playing trash-like. \n\nI don't mind people that are bad; what I mind is people that are bad and do not take any advice given to them. That always irritates me and its because of their fat ego that they can't accept any criticism at all so in that point, I just call them _**Trash**_.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jennifer420","date":"2019-04-15T09:21:13.900+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"yes they respond, usually with \"stfu noob\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"KillerCryptid","date":"2019-04-15T08:52:28.865+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I tried doing that in the past but I mostly just get the usual \"shut up\" or \"fuck you\"\nBut then again I understand, when I am in that situation, tilted, losing, dying over and over, I probably won't listen, but sometimes I would and it genuinely helped\nIt is just difficult to calm yourself when you are tilted and people often don't work on it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zane Zephyr","date":"2019-04-15T06:02:54.865+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"all you can do is offer it. you cant force them to listen, so all you can do is be as respectful and not condescending as possible and hope for the best.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vlada Cut","date":"2019-04-20T20:25:12.664+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They either respond it nicely or don't respond or say \"wtf :D\" because they didn't understand my criticizm.\nThey definetly play even worse if you yell at them or argue with them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"y0r1ck","date":"2019-04-17T02:34:07.617+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sadly you can't tell teammates what to do because most of them have enormous egos.
