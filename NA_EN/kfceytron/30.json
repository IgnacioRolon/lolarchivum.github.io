How is that fair? If they go through champ select knowing that they won't want to play the match ahead of them, they're supposed to dodge. AFKing and/or inting are not appropriate, and reportable.\n\nAlso, a couple matches after the 21-minute loss, we had another asshole who did the exact same thing, AFKing because the rest of us didn't have two augs (he and one other player had two, another had three, and the rest had four). It took nearly half an hour, but we actually won. And he won, because he was there, even though he just stood there sulking instead of helping.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/RBIOKo5","replies":[]}]}]}
