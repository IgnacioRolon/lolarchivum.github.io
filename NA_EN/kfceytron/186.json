I love it when an ARAM Karthus is goes for the hard feeder stray because it usually does nothing good. If he goes in alone, than just spreading out will give you more from his death than his team gets. If his team follows, you have turret advantage and can easily turn a fight to your favor. Once you're in the midgame, a karthus who engages can often be bursted and disengaged from, leaving his team in a shitty 4v5.\n\nI'd always rather face this type of Karthus than one who plays the early game safe and goes in second midgame.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2019-09-23T00:10:58.674+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"This is one of the things I really hate dealing with in aram.
