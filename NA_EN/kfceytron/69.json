In the real world of physical experience, people occasionally need to defend themselves from harm. This means taking whatever actions are necessary to prevent some sort of malady or injury from befalling us. For example, someone who took a wrong turn in a bad neighborhood may find themselves the victim of an assault. If they do nothing, they may be grievously injured. Therefore, it's reasonable for this person to not only e.g. use their arms to protect their head, but also to hit back at the person attacking them. The reasoning behind such an action is that the attacker will either rethink their actions and break off the attack, or, if they do not, they may be physically incapacitated by their victim's retaliation. This is why firearms - a type of weapon - have legitimate defensive purposes. If an attacker is physically imposing and skilled in hand-to-hand combat, it's logical to defend oneself from that from as great a distance as possible, which firearms permit.\r\n\r\nThis is why it is relatively commonplace to hear that one person attacked another in self defense - a reactionary attack that prevented an attack. Self defense is commonly considered to be an acceptable practice, even when it involves going on the offensive, if that's what's necessary for someone to protect themselves from harm.\r\n\r\nLoL chat is \"real life\" in that it occurs between real people, but this interaction is far removed from the context of physical experience. No one can be injured by participating in LoL chat, and it's entirely voluntary. The only component of LoL chat is the messages we send and receive. Unfortunately, some players occasionally decide to send chat messages that bother other players, whether through racial and homophobic slurs, harassment, or spam. Understandably, other players would like to protect themselves from this unpleasantness. Here we have \"self defense.\" However, while the basic idea here is the same as it is for self defense in the real world, there is one very important practical difference.\r\n\r\nThere is a mute function.\r\n\r\nMuting another player prevents any of their chat messages from reaching you. The degree of protection is so absolute that you won't even know when a muted player is talking. It is the end-all, be-all of self defense. A good thing, too, because \"hitting back\" like we occasionally do to defend ourselves in the real world _doesn't even work in LoL chat_. Nothing a player says carries any kind of authority over other players. Flaming back just tells the toxic player that they got under someone's skin, which is more likely to spur them on than quell their efforts. In the real world, passive measures (like covering our head with our arms) might not be enough to save us from harm, while \"hitting back\" can occasionally be effective, which is why the latter is considered acceptable. LoL chat is the opposite. The purely defensive measure of muting is 100% effective, and flaming back is 100% ineffective.\r\n\r\nMuting is the only self-defense.

Muting prevents any of their chat following the mute from reaching you, consequently preventing them from causing any further harm, and reporting them pings their behavior to Riot and the IFS so that they can be punished, and get their just desserts.\n\nWanna know who wins in a flame war? Nobody. In League, you don't beat a bully by flaming them back. They're still going to bully you, because flaming back is a sign that they're negatively affecting you and it gives them all the more reason to _keep doing it_.\n\nAnd at the end of the day, both participants in the flame war lose; reports get filed, both players get punished.","replies":[{"poster":"xDogMeatx","date":"2019-03-03T16:56:03.693+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"wow im surprised you responded to me i thought i scared you off with my weird wording.  \n\nanyways true no one wins at the end but it feels the bully doesnt get punished kinda like that \"kid\" who bothers others but the teacher ignores them thing.  i do try to ignore the person i rarely mute i mean if they flame me in chat i think if i report them the proof would be blocked since i cant see their words that damns them after game (since its my report i figure its from my point of view only).  does the report apply globally or just the reporters point of view in other words?  anyways yes again thanks for responding excuse me if i offended you.","replies":[{"poster":"Umbral Regent","date":"2019-03-03T17:07:42.970+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> wow im surprised you responded to me i thought i scared you off with my weird wording.\n\nIt's legible enough, don't worry.\n\n> ...but it feels the bully doesnt get punished kinda like that \"kid\" who bothers others but the teacher ignores them thing.\n\nThat is certainly an understandable viewpoint. It's difficult to ignore a player misbehaving when there's no immediately viable solution. Though, sadly, I'm unsure if there would be any reliable way to get some satisfaction back in the process of muting.\n\n> i do try to ignore the person i rarely mute i mean if they flame me in chat i think if i report them the proof would be blocked since i cant see their words that damns them after game (since its my report i figure its from my point of view only). does the report apply globally or just the reporters point of view in other words?\n\nIf a player is reported, their behavior is looked at in whole by the IFS, and if they flame and misbehave even after you muted them, that misbehavior will still count against them.\n\nIn much the same manner, a player on one team could report someone on the enemy team for chat misbehavior, and if the reported player misbehaved, that report would still be valid. (Although, I have seen some edge cases pertaining to premade groups and what enemy players could see in /all chat, but, by and large, those are the exception, not the rule.)\n\nIn short, muting won't have any diminishing effect on what the IFS looks at when reviewing a reported player's behavior, so if someone starts causing trouble, you're free to mute them at the start of it and report them post-game in confidence.\n\n> anyways yes again thanks for responding excuse me if i offended you.\n\nNo sweat.

Full premade teams have a degree of leniency from the system so long as they keep their misbehavior and off-color humor amongst themselves, as the principle is, if nobody reports it, then they must have been okay with it. Following that, there's another consideration;\n\n2) Did their misbehavior appear in /all chat? While it is wholly possible for a player to be punished for misbehavior that another player didn't see (whether by muting or by teamchat restrictions), it is also wholly possible for a player to have the punishment appealed on account of the same factor; the enemy didn't see it, so if everyone on the team who could see it was okay with it, what say should the enemy team have on something they're not privy to?\n\nExceptional cases like these are few and far between, though there is consideration put into addressing them, both by the community and by Riot themselves.\n\nFor the largest part, an edge case can best be described as a punishment that could potentially be overturned despite, technically speaking, being properly placed, due to factors beside the behavior itself.","replies":[{"poster":"xDogMeatx","date":"2019-03-03T18:12:48.782+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Any3aQ5Vgjs\n\nBefore I go if you have connections with the balance/design team there's a message I want you to transfer them...

Muting means you don't have to see the rude person's chat anymore, so it's up to you to move on.\n\nPoint #4 implies that \"EVERYONE PLS REPOT X PLAYER\" makes you more likely to get punished. It doesn't. One report has the same effect as nine. However, that sort of chat is considered harassment, which is itself reportable and can lead to a punishment for that player.\n\nPoint #5 only occurs if you flamed back before muting (or if you started the argument and then muted after the people you harassed join in). If all you say in chat is perfectly ordinary stuff related to the game (\"jg heading mid,\" \"baron pit is warded,\" etc.), you won't get punished for it. IFS doesn't use some kind of voting system where a troll campaigns to get you banned and if you don't explain that you didn't do anything wrong you'll end up with nine reports and an instant ban.\n\nIf you absolutely feel the need to flame people, you might get punished for it (it sounds like that's already happened to you).

Muting teammates in ranked is a fools errand as it limits the communication in this TEAM game.\n\nOdds are, if a player is starting to harass and be toxic, the line of communication there is already gone. If you’re strong enough to ignore it in case something useful comes through, you do you. Often times that’s not the case though. The mute just allows one to not worry about seeing that constant stream.\n\nHowever, if you don’t take that option and leave them unmuted, you have no support should you start attacking back.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"PH45","date":"2019-03-02T12:53:26.896+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"Agreed. {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"CurrentBanTallyV","date":"2019-03-02T22:39:52.361+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"Trolls (myself included) LOVE players like you.

And thanks to people like you **they cant fight back EITHER**. \n\nMy favorite part of being a bully is when the victim cannot defend himself. They just have to sit there and take it, getting angrier and angrier until they eventually snap. It's so satisfying because they have everything to lose. \n\nKeep up the good work!!\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}]}
