For example, Pug&#039;Maw has chromas for other breeds, like a Rottweiler (more like Dog&#039;Maw). This was intended to prevent full-priced skins like &quot;green Taric,&quot; &quot;red Taric,&quot; &quot;pink Taric,&quot; &quot;green Xerath,&quot; &quot;red Xerath,&quot; and so on. Those type of skins don&#039;t have appreciably different aesthetics and themes, so they&#039;ve been released as low-priced chromas for a while now.\r\n\r\nAnd now we have two Popstar Ahri skins. Why not two Dragon Trainer Tristana skins? Maybe there&#039;ll be a new sequel to &quot;How to Train Your Dragon&quot; and the studio will make a deal with Riot for a new skin that showcases the new dragon. Or how about a new Arcade Sona skin with a different arcade instrument, or a new hairstyle?\r\n\r\nIn the same way that Hollywood likes to produce the same movie over and over again (I _liked_ Eric Bana Hulk and Tobey Maguire Spider-Man), Riot now has an excuse to reboot skins. Why come up with risky new ideas when you can just tweak an old idea, tried and true, and re-release it at full price?","replies":[{"poster":"Wulf Helhammer","date":"2018-09-26T00:38:00.162+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Larger changes then colors and small patterns are basically exclusive to Pug'Maw and Birdio.

You'd be okay with New Battlecast Skarner with walkers instead of treads and club arms instead of chainsaw arms? New Bilgewater Swain with a cutlass and a three-cornered hat?","replies":[{"poster":"GreenLore","date":"2018-09-26T09:03:03.378+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Doesn't really change the fact that your initial statement is just wrong.\nChromas are color changes(with occasional pattern changes),they are usually not model changes.\n\nAnd this skin does have model changes(and probably even some new effects for those crystal tails),so its not a chroma.\n\n\nBesides the skins likely represend the band singing at the championship,so its possible that the band was able to choose their own 4 champs for the skinline.","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2018-09-26T09:38:34.365+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=GreenLore,realm=EUW,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=Tw9eLkoB,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2018-09-26T09:03:03.378+0000)\n>\n> Doesn&#x27;t really change the fact that your initial statement is just wrong.\n> Chromas are color changes(with occasional pattern changes),they are usually not model changes.\n> \n> And this skin does have model changes(and probably even some new effects for those crystal tails),so its not a chroma.\n> \n> \n> Besides the skins likely represend the band singing at the championship,so its possible that the band was able to choose their own 4 champs for the skinline.\n\nThere are more chromas with model changes than there are reboots of the same skin. New Popstar Ahri should've been a chroma and not a separate, full-price skin. My statement was correct.\n\nWhen the band chose their champions, Riot should've said, \"sorry, the game already has a Popstar Ahri.\" Product placement is one thing (like M&M's in E.T.), but this is like expecting people to pay full price for a movie with commercial breaks. It's very disappointing.\n\nAnd people _will_ buy it, because apparently it's too difficult to find Ahri porn online.","replies":[{"poster":"GreenLore","date":"2018-09-26T12:32:34.874+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"The difference in model changes for chromas is extremely minor though and most of the time Riot simply draws some clothes on top of the champion model like Graves suspenders.\nhttps://i.ytimg.com/vi/sMttb2_NVO4/maxresdefault.jpg\n\nHowever the 2 popstar-ahri skins wear completely different clohtes.\nThe original one wears a hat and has uniform-like clothing,while the one from the leak lacks the hat and has skintight clothes,with some gold ornaments.(not to mention those crystal-tails).\n\nThe changes are far bigger than any chroma.","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2018-09-26T14:40:04.565+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=GreenLore,realm=EUW,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=Tw9eLkoB,comment-id=00000000000000000000,timestamp=2018-09-26T12:32:34.874+0000)\n>\n> The difference in model changes for chromas is extremely minor though and most of the time Riot simply draws some clothes on top of the champion model like Graves suspenders.\n> https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sMttb2_NVO4/maxresdefault.jpg\n> \n> However the 2 popstar-ahri skins wear completely different clohtes.\n> The original one wears a hat and has uniform-like clothing,while the one from the leak lacks the hat and has skintight clothes,with some gold ornaments.(not to mention those crystal-tails).\n> \n> The changes are far bigger than any chroma.\n\nAhri already had a Popstar skin. Now she's getting another Popstar skin. Do you really believe that tighter clothes and earrings instead of a hat justifies a new, separate skin? It's a skin for a skin, and thus should be available as a modification to that existing theme... also known as a chroma.","replies":[{"poster":"GreenLore","date":"2018-09-26T17:39:55.041+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"You don't seem to understand the definition of a chroma.\n\nA chroma is just a recolor that might come with very minor model changes,its a specific modification to a skin.(heck thats where the name chroma comes from,as it refers to them being mostly color changes)\n\nThis skin will have a completely different set of clothes(possibly a different hairstyle as well,hard to tell with just the splash art),animations,splash art and effects than the other one.That fails on the very basic level of what defines a chroma.\n\nAnyway they did say something about there being a \"prestige edition\" of popstar Kai'sa and it looks like Kai'sa will have 2 different version of her popstar skin that greatly differ in terms of style(though I feel like the purple one is the standard,so who knows).\nSo its possible that this Ahri skin will essentially count as \"prestige edition\" of the regular popstar Ahri or vice versa.\nWe really never had anything like \"prestige edition\"-versions of skins outside maybe the original championship riven(but that was a special case).","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Sukishoo","date":"2018-09-26T17:41:50.192+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We haven't even learned the details on the 2018 Popstar Ahri.
