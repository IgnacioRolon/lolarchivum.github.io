The removal message starts with:\r\n\r\n> We've recently removed your post for violating the Boards Universal Rules, primarily pertaining the rule:\r\n> \r\n> Facilitate Civil Discussion- When you choose to participate in a discussion with the rest of the playerbase, always try to be respectful and receptive to another player's point of view. Also, be mindful of how you present your point of view. If a player feels strongly on a subject, don't get caught up trying to have the last word. Just state your side and exit the conversation gracefully rather than give them the opportunity to pick a fight.\r\n\r\nWhich gives me the impression that I misbehaved and offended someone somehow. But then it says:\r\n\r\n> This has been removed because it quotes and responds to content that has been deleted and lacks context without it.\r\n\r\nWhich made me think it was simply part of cleanup and I didn't misbehave. But then it swings back to this:\r\n\r\n> While we understand that you may be upset or frustrated, the Moderation Team does not accept this as a valid excuse to be uncivilized, and we ultimately require that all discussions on the Boards be civil.\r\n> \r\n> I'd like to emphasize that this is not a warning; however, please take some time to familiarize yourself with the Boards Universal Rules, as well as the guidelines for any sub-board you intend to post in before you do so.\r\n\r\nWhich tells me that I appeared upset or frustrated and acted without civility, and, although I'm being let off without a warning this time, I should reread the rules to ensure that I don't mess up again.\r\n\r\nI'm very confused.
