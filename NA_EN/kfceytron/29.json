I wanted Hail of Blades for this particular match, but I don't already have a page with it because the _other_ bug that periodically wipes everything makes it pointless to save lots of different rune page setups. A bug that frequently wipes saved rune pages and a bug that makes it impossible to edit rune pages... that's not a good combination.\r\n\r\nI'm not angry at you, Riot.
