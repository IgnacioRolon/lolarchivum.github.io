On October 6th, I decided that I had finished enough Odyssey missions (Ziggs skin shard and icon for all accounts, veteran emote on a couple), and I ran out of patience helping stragglers in Discord finish their missions. Since then, I&#039;ve played a total of one game, on the 10th, because I noticed I hadn&#039;t played for a few days and was feeling a sense of obligation.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m not saying I quit the game, or I will quit, grr rage post, that sort of thing. I&#039;m keeping LoL updated, and I sometimes consider playing. It&#039;s just that I realized that every time I considered loading up a match, I found myself thinking, &quot;ugh, not that stuff again.&quot; I used to enjoy LoL.\r\n\r\nI don&#039;t know why I&#039;m making this post.\r\n\r\nI think I am sad.\r\n\r\n:(","replies":[]}
