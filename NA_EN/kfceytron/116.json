This is happening when all players are present, throughout the entirety of every match (except when your team approaches the enemy fountain, at which point they might &quot;wake up&quot; and try to fight you while they&#039;re level 3). It&#039;s not the problematic bots (Yasuo, Taric, et al.), either - any single bot that would&#039;ve gone top lane for that match will AFK. Someone I played with observed that the AFK bot is generally a champ that can jungle, but I think that&#039;s just coincidence (if Noc and Nunu bots were present in a given match, I wouldn&#039;t expect both of them to be broken/AFK).","replies":[{"poster":"MidnightxPMC","date":"2018-07-19T15:04:29.629+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Happening to me too.

But then if you don't have a jungler you end up with a 2v1 and it's really boring. And it messes with pentas.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Aknovy","date":"2018-07-25T18:45:17.710+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For me it was nunu 5 times now.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hare Krishna","date":"2018-07-20T20:17:32.943+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"RIOT does not even recognize this as a bug, since there is no notification \"we are aware...and we're working on it\".","replies":[]}]}
