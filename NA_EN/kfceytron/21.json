Or only when the rest of the team is okay with it? It sets a very bad precedent.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-03-29T15:35:36.621+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=KFCeytron,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ojE0RngN,comment-id=,timestamp=2019-03-28T18:47:52.224+0000)\n>\n> On top of that, I guarantee you some people won't notice the requirement to do it with a premade, and will AFK, int, etc. with random teammates who intended to win (as everyone is supposed to).\n\nSure enough, I just had a solo queue co-op lobby where two people announced that they wanted to lose. It took the entire pick timer for the rest of us to convince them that you need a premade to do that mission and that it is possible to queue as a premade for co-op.
