The total damage is increased by 0% - 150% (based on distance traveled).~~\r\n\r\n~~If the star does not hit an enemy, it lingers at maximum range for 1 second.~~\r\n\r\n~~While the star is out, Zoe can reactivate Paddle Star to redirect it to a new location near her, resetting its damage modifier on cast. The redirected star can travel beyond the new target location, continuing forward until it moves more than 800 units from Zoe.~~\r\n\r\n~~MINIMUM~~ MAGIC DAMAGE:\r\n~~7 - 50 (based on level)~~ (+ 50 / 75 / 100 / 125 / 150) (+ 60% AP)\r\n\r\n**W**: ~~PASSIVE - SPELL THIEF: Whenever enemy champions cast a Spells icon summoner spell or item active, they drop the corresponding Spell Shard onto the ground that grants Sight icon sight over a 100-radius area and remains for 40 seconds. Some enemy Minions Killed icon minions spawn with random Spell Shards that only drop to the ground for 20 seconds if killed by Zoe.~~\r\n\r\n~~Collecting a Spell Shard allows Zoe to activate Spell Thief within the next 60 seconds. She can replace her current Spell Thief active by moving directly onto another Spell Shard.~~\r\n\r\nACTIVE: ~~Zoe mimics the active of the collected Spell Shard.~~\r\n\r\n~~PASSIVE ~~- WHEEEEE: ~~Casting Spell Thief or one of her own summoner spells~~ grants Zoe Movement speed for the next few seconds, and summons three bubbles that orbit her for the next 10 seconds. The bubbles autonomously hurl themselves at the nearest enemy in range, prioritizing her attack target, dealing magic damage.\r\n\r\nBONUS MOVEMENT SPEED:\r\n30 / 40 / 50 / 60 / 70%\r\nBONUS MOVEMENT SPEED DURATION:\r\n2 / 2.25 / 2.5 / 2.75 / 3\r\nTOTAL MAGIC DAMAGE:\r\n75 / 105 / 135 / 165 / 195 (+ 40% AP)\r\n\r\nE: ACTIVE: Zoe kicks a bubble in the target direction that bursts on the first enemy hit, ~~else forming a trap at maximum range for 4 seconds that arms after 0.8 seconds. The bubble can only move through terrain once but may do so indefinitely, can only move up to 650 units once outside terrain, and will fall short if it would enter terrain again.~~\r\n\r\nThe bubble deals magic damage on contact with an enemy and renders them drowsy for 2.2 seconds, which gradually slows them, after which they fall asleep for 2 seconds.\r\n\r\n~~The next instance of champion damage taken by the sleeping target deals bonus true damage equal to the post-mitigation damage dealt, capped at Sleepy Trouble Bubble&#039;s damage.~~\r\n\r\nMAXIMUM SLOW:\r\n10 / 20 / 30 / 40 / 50%\r\nMAGIC DAMAGE:\r\n60 / 100 / 140 / 180 / 220 (+ 40% AP)\r\n~~MAXIMUM MIXED DAMAGE:~~\r\n~~120 / 200 / 280 / 360 / 440 (+ 80% AP)~~\r\n\r\n**R**: ACTIVE: After a brief delay, Zoe dives into a portal that she opens beneath her, blinking to the target location. _Two charges._\r\n\r\n~~Zoe remains able to attack and cast abilities during Portal Jump, and can see over walls, but is unable to move. After 1 second, she falls back through the portal and blinks back to her cast location.~~","replies":[{"poster":"Khristophoros","date":"2018-08-15T23:51:35.979+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I liked it until I saw the ult.

They can't buff it now because it can already take out most of a health bar.
