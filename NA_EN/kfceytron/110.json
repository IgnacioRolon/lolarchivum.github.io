At that point, only squishies who build no health will be getting hit by the minimum damage (50) rather than the percentage (4%), as 4% of a level 2 champ's base health would be around 25, which would be kind of garbage. Keep in mind that's every three hits, so that's an average of about 15 extra damage per hit rather than 8.\n\nBy the time Vayne starts putting more points into W (8 and up), even squishies building no health won't be taking the minimum damage. At rank 5, it's 14% every three hits. Every time. Not boosted by AD, not boosted by lethality; nothing changes it from 14%.\n\nThe more impact her W has, the healthier the interaction, because it means longer fights. Can you imagine a champion autoattacking an enemy 15-20 consecutive times rather than chunking 95% of the target's health with one spell and one auto? That'd be neat.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Dönald J Trump","date":"2019-01-30T18:59:25.778+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What?","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-01-30T19:02:35.206+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Dönald J Trump,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=M169FNul,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2019-01-30T18:59:25.778+0000)\n>\n> What?\n\nOkay, the first paragraph is a fact, not an opinion, but \"the game would be in a much better state\" is an opinion, so I went with that.","replies":[]}]}]}
