Almost every mode is filled with botters","subforum":"General Discussion","up_votes":20,"down_votes":2,"body":"Co-op, TT, ARAM, and I haven't tried normals but probably there as well. New players will probably start in co-op, where they will consistently have three or four botters on their team. They will eventually try a few normals and possibly be okay there, and then they'll try the other available modes and have a couple botters on their team every time. It only stops when you climb past that MMR, which generally means the \"more likely they're on the enemy team\" logic of hoping that the enemy team has more botters. And in co-op, of course, it doesn't stop, because co-op doesn't have MMR. Granted, the botters infest intro, and intro bots are about as strong as today's scripts, but it's a bad experience even so.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone actually join LoL independently anymore, or is it all word of mouth with players asking their friends to join? Do those independent new players actually enjoy the game and stay, or do they get tired of the botters and leave?","replies":[]}
