Skillful was the Odyssey augment that made Yasuo always crit near the edge of his auto and Q range but never crit otherwise.\r\n\r\nThis would change so many things about Yasuo, from his build to his play style. Since it was live only in Odyssey where enemies generally either stand there or slowly approach you while SR is much more dynamic, I'm not sure how it would play out. Any guesses or theories? Do you suppose Riot has tested this internally?","replies":[{"poster":"Tahminatrix ","date":"2019-08-17T00:26:14.958+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He would be oppressive against immobile champs who cant really avoid his q without being bullied from farming.\n\nThis would also be an immense buff pre first back when yasuo`s crit passive normally isn't even in play yet.\n\n\nBut later on he might be alittle bit weaker unless he buys {{item:3022}} and abuses the crap out of it in order to bully anyone who doesn't have ms buffs, slow ignores, etc...\n\n\nHe would probably be useless against champs like {{champion:11}} {{champion:92}} {{champion:114}} {{champion:38}} ","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-08-17T00:36:15.137+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Tahminatrix ,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=qe8fQKYf,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2019-08-17T00:26:14.958+0000)\n>\n> He would be oppressive against immobile champs who cant really avoid his q without being bullied from farming.\n> \n> This would also be an immense buff pre first back.\n\nWell, it would give him an _opportunity_ to crit early game, but he would have to do a certain thing. Late game, instead of always critting, he would still have to do a certain thing. I find it interesting to think about. :)","replies":[{"poster":"Tahminatrix ","date":"2019-08-17T01:09:18.128+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Again, yasuo players normally hit their q with the tip along with at max auto range, forcing someone to consistently run towards yasuo in order to avoid the crit from his q will just mean they are still in range for him to attempt to max range auto them again.\n\nNot to mention the leniency that the tip of his q / autos can be in his favor.\n\nThis would make many matchups that are favorable to yasuo even better while making yasuo useless against certain champs that can just jump inside of him consistently and yasuo wont have any way of being able to crit.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"flibitydoo","date":"2019-08-17T01:25:39.696+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it would break him because he would feel no incentive to build crit items\n\nhe can now immediately start working towards a ravenous hydra to give him big ad and lifesteal and aoe damage or a titanic hydra if he wants the flat health to survive skrimishes and teamfights instead, following up with a second item spear of shojin or cleaver for more windwall uptime.

Even with what amounts to a map full of jungle monsters, it wasn't so easy to consistently hit the sweet spot.\n\nYasuo has already left mid, as he works better as a bot ADC with a support.\n\nI'm wondering whether it'd be better to balance him for \"crit if you're Skillful\" than \"0/10 power spike.\" :P But that might widen the gap between good and bad Yasuos, and no one wants another Ryze/Azir/etc. So I dunno.\n\nI'm not sure why I'm being downvoted; I thought it was an interesting discussion topic. It's not like I'm saying \"YaSuO nEeDs 100% CrIt\" or \"ReMoVe YaSuO pAsSiVe\" or something.","replies":[]}]}]}
