Here are my last 13 Kat games (most recent first), \"WL, grade, K/D/A, CS/minutes\":\n\nW, A+, 24/5/8, 166/37\nW, B-, 5/4/1/87, 87/20\nW, S-, 22/2/3, 143/29\nW, B+, 8/3/3, 92/22\nW, S-, 15/1/2, 113/22\nL, B+, 8/3/5, 79/20\nL, S-, 18/3/9, 208/37\nW, ?, 8/3/10, 104/27\nL, C+, 3/3/0, 62/16\nW, C+, 3/3/8, 93/28\nW, ?, 8/0/3, 122/22\nW, ?, 21/1/9, 160/30\nW, ?, 8/9/17, 69/15\n\nI hit M5 with that most recent match, and M6 requires S- or better, twice (to say nothing of M7's S+ or better, three times). But, as you can see, my grades are usually mediocre.\n\nNow, I'm fully aware that my CS is bad, basically topping out at 5/min. I'm trying to improve that, not only during lane phase but also later on when side lanes have lots of farm available. The problem I'm having with CS is that I sometimes have to choose between mindlessly split pushing for CS and joining my team for a teamfight, and the latter is usually preferable given Kat's strengths.\n\nSo. Any tips for getting those tokens? Focus more on CS and less on kills, ward more, maybe even switch to something kooky like bot lane APC Kat? Any advice welcome.","replies":[{"poster":"Bent Pixels","date":"2020-02-12T13:59:14.832+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"CS is definitely the culprit here. As you are aware, 5 cs/min is bad.

Good KDA, lots of kills, and winning lots of games, but bad CS. Only recently did I figure out how to balance between CS and trades in lane. It just takes practice and a lot of time to get down.

By end game almost everyone wave clears faster than you which is one reason why it's so hard to get an S-/S/S+. If other lanes won, you're just gonna sit at around 150-160 CS and barely move.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=KFCeytron,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=8VFGvaZ0,comment-id=00010000000000000000,timestamp=2020-02-12T10:17:16.015+0000)\n>\n> That's a good point about taking kills.

If you get a not so good matchup, well....better luck next time, lol. I don't think very many are skill matchups. Riven is probably about the only one and that's only because you can E behind her Q3. If you're going into a really rough matchup it's sometimes better to just get the 3 anal beads and a pot and farm it out as best you can. You can avoid ganks better than a lot of other mid laners because of your E, but if your minion wave is pushed you're still gonna have a rough time. I haven't played Akali since her gutting, but I remember a long time ago I was playing Akali support and it worked REALLY well with a relic shield start. \n","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2020-02-14T00:56:39.493+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Apparently, W, A+, 8/0/4, 121/20 is a thing.

Bot is also an unusual position for Kat so you have a lot more potential to get an S there(not to mention no ADCs to take your waves). It's also EXTREMELY fun to play her in bot lane and not really troll at all. I played her bot quite a bit a while back and had a higher win rate than my mid lane win rate. That said, that was when Dark Harvest wasn't a troll rune and you could actually get some use out of it. I went with a lich bane build and it was extremely fun(sadly they destroyed Dark Harvest and the lich bane build isn't as useful).\nJSYK, her best supports are something like a Leona or a Nami. Both are extremely helpful and if you both start ignite you can get an early double kill with a dark seal and really snowball from there. Leona and Nami are my favorite supports as bot lane Kat.","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2020-02-12T06:13:28.994+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=VoraciousX,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=8VFGvaZ0,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2020-02-12T04:49:13.670+0000)\n>\n> CS is mostly the problem, because her damage is so delayed an ADC will take your entire wave before you do your first Q>E.
