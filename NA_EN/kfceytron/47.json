Summoner spells reset to Ghost/Heal, and not only did the _selected_ rune page switch to a preset, but _all of those pages are wiped._ The pages I bought aren't removed, fortunately, but they're blank. Why is this happening? Why doesn't Riot fucking fix it? Something is wiping out data. Find the function that does that, find what's calling it and where, and remove that function call when it doesn't need to be there. I see threads pop up about this all the time, and Riot ignores them. Well, fuck you too, Riot.","replies":[]}
