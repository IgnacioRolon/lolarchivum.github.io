They'll grind in-game for hours to buy a few dollars' worth of premium currency, and believe that this means everything in the game is free and there's no such thing as a paywall. I've even encountered people who will literally pay real money for a lifetime subscription that includes a monthly stipend of in-game currency and then claim they're getting free stuff every month, or even that they're getting paid to play.\r\n\r\nI wish it were limited to online games, but it even happens in real life: I once saw an ad for my local junior college's shuttle service, which proclaimed \"one small fee and then it's free!\"\r\n\r\nAs the saying goes, \"any sufficiently advanced troll is indistinguishable from a genuine kook.\" Whether they're trolls or kooks, I see a perplexing amount of this particular brand of stupid. Can anyone explain why it's so common/popular?","replies":[]}
