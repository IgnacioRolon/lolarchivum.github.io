On top of that, there is no longer any active mission with a path involving only champs not in the free rotation. The current free rotation has one champ for Mission 14's NB path (Zilean) and one champ for Mission 15's NB path (Garen).

So I don't know what you're talking about when you claim that this was announced in the client as well as on Boards.\n\nTwitter, Reddit, etc. are not League of Legends, and players should therefore not be expected to monitor those innumerable places for news. Do I also need to check LoL's Facebook page, Instagram, Google+, and every other platform? Or I have to find out about it in a news article (I don't even know what \"comicbook\" is)? Riot should tell outside outlets rather than informing players directly? That's like reading the morning paper and finding out that you don't have to go to work because the company folded and told the newspaper rather than the employees.\n\nI'm more sure now than I was before that this information was not properly communicated. Riot should be able to communicate critical information to players without a ridiculous scavenger hunt (with no clues nor even the admission that it is in fact a scavenger hunt).","replies":[{"poster":"xxxDogmanxxx","date":"2018-12-19T07:53:14.177+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Whoops, you're right about there being no official announcement in the boards.

Meanwhile, 100% of the playerbase sees the client. I'll take your word for it that you saw it, but the deployment of that announcement was bugged to either not show on some clients or not be available for long enough.\n\nIndeed, like I said, the only way for a player who doesn't have these champions to discover this information in the client is to queue up and play Nexus Blitz _without intending to work on the mission_. Do you think it's a good time to provide information about a mission when someone is specifically intending to not do it? Saying the information was \"easy and open to find\" isn't a matter of opinion; it's an incorrect fact.\n\nAnd if everyone and their cousin can make a big deal about \"I died to Yasuo again,\" I can make a big deal about Riot not knowing how to communicate important information. :) In this instance, it could literally have been included in the mission text. >.>","replies":[{"poster":"xxxDogmanxxx","date":"2018-12-19T09:59:26.222+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay, I get your point.
