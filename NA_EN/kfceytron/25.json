The standard they have set for language as punishment is an unrealizable one, considering the decay of social society in most of the countries in which they operate. Furthermore, Riot itself has recently gotten in trouble for Sexual Preference/Harassment in the workplace, and a \"man's workplace\" environment. \n\nIf you have no moral fortitude with which to enforce a policy, and your ambition with such policy unenforceable both because it's unachievable to begin with and because your users witness you yourself(Riot) not adhering to the rules themselves, why even try?\n\nJust reduce discipline to a level where it only gets rid of the worst offenders, not \"Human Nature.\"\n\nThen you wouldn't have a comparison of \"Troll Discipline vs Verbal Discipline.\" \n\nTroll enforcement is abstract and there's no way it never will be.

You don't have to go in depth and try to decipher their rules, they're right there on the website, in the TOS, and pasted around every official Riot product. If you can't comprehend that, it's on you. \n\n[ The proof is right here on the \"Report a Player FAQ\" of Riot's Support website.](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752884-Reporting-a-Player)\n\n> \"Do not ask other players in the match to report the offending player. **It only takes one report for our systems to review a game.

While they are important to bringing games to our attention the system still gauges the behavior in game before punishments are issued.

What they are disagreeing with is the \"only one report matters.\"\n\nFrom my experience, it's the class -action reporting games which actually DO result in visible discipline.\n\nIt's VERY likely that multiple reports add extra information via comments/context, and that they do statistically increase the review process by Riot beyond the IFS.\n\nIf the Player management resources Riot employs works like any other shop, each and every report will initially be given a ticket number, and if escalated by that IFS, will reach a different Riot employee. Then, the Riot employees will probably forward all the secondary reports to the first report's personnel recipient to consolidate the process.\n\nThat means, the end reviewer very likely does receive all 4-9 reports. Which he probably DOES take into consideration when reviewing it.\n\nI know ODiiiiiN was vague, but there's a reason he said they were BOTH wrong, and this is probably why.

There is a Rioter involved in every Ban email. The IFS deals with filtering through and cataloging complaints, forwards complaints of hate speech to real people after running through an inventory of known slurs.\n\nAnd any final Discipline does indeed reach a rioter.\n\nFor example, if you are a first time offender, your record make look like this:\n\n-221 reports recieved\n-89 reports found to be credible\n-132 reports found to be fraudulent/lacking\n-440 reports made by you\n\nIt may have taken 89 games to actually flag discipline, but somewhere around ~80 credible reports on you recieved, a Rioter got involved and began monitoring reports against you.\n\nThey then use those chat logs in your discipline report to back their case of punishment. That part is not automated.\n\n(Most of the system is)\n\n------------------------------------\n\nOne report is enough to trigger a review. That's true. (not proven, btw. Proof would require us to have access to knowledge we don't have)\n\nKeep in mind..... multiple reports will not report for the same thing:\n\nThe initial report from Player 1 may just say \"Verbal Abuse\" while a secondary report may say \"Verbal Abuse + Hate Speech.\" The first would have only flagged a review of the violation the ticket is saying.... and looked for random word combination violations for Verbal Abuse. The second would flag a review by a real person, as the violation holds a grander scale punishment (skipping steps in the punishment CoC, and going straight to bans)","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Chase The Gas","date":"2018-12-30T07:32:48.558+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Idk if you are troll or not, but what kind of evidence you have against it?

I'm not saying something you agree with so all of the sudden I'm the toxic guy huh. You're exactly the type of person that would write  \"/all report X person\" to the enemy team over a misunderstanding.\n\nAnyways like I said, I was ready to write a 3 paragraph reply of how I know for a fact it happens. Bc it's happened to me many times when i started the game and I see everyone claiming the same thing. So anyone with half a wit will put two and two together and see through the Reps BS, that the system does indeed rely on multiple people to be triggered.\n\nBut just to humor your curiosity, In the beginning, when I first started out... I came in with guns blazing calling everyone all kinds of names (mainly bc I was getting flamed first, I'm really not the type that starts stuff, I hate that shit tbh.. I like helping people and newbies and stuff... but when someone starts flaming ME.. then all hell breaks loose. I guess I'm the retaliation type, which is still wrong IK... I learned from my bans.)  Every single one of my bans (3 chat bans) were confirmed by the Riot reps to \"not being too bad, but I still should have refrained myself and just muted\". \n\nNow I know the system needs multiple people to ban you because every time I got a ban I was arguing with multiple people. Neither times I said anything offensive, just plain old arguments with a \"fuck\" here and there... which is why I know its not just words that get you (unless ure dropping bombs).. If you're using words you use all the time and you argue with a dude and u know youre going to report each other after a game and nothing happens... how come when you argue with multiple people with the same words and you know for sure more than 3 people are gonna report you.. and immediately 30 mins after it happens, sure enough you get that ban... then tell me how could you not think the system is mob-biased. I honest to god just dont even feed arguements anymore...  A year after the first 2 chat bans, I was honor 4 and lost it all after the 3rd chat ban and never felt so betrayed. All over a silly argument. Its not worth even defending yourself from flamers. Just let them talk and report them after. If thats the name of the game, thats how I play it now. But do I know that its wrong and flawed? yes it is. Because a lot of flamers get away with it, especially if theyre in premades. Lets not even talk about the abusers, like ppl in ranked that will asking everyone to report someone if they start doing bad.","replies":[{"poster":"Chase The Gas","date":"2018-12-30T08:41:10.984+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I'm \"toxic in ways the system cant detect\"....

You're exactly the type of person that would write \"/all report X person\" to the enemy team over a misunderstanding.\n\nI asked if you are troll, since nowadays it's quite often. Can't see where I offended you, but whatever. Btw never ask for report it may and will get you banned by one report.\n\nBcs from mine(experience) if you(me, you, anyone) are toxic in way that system can't detect(mainly modified slurs/irony) you(me,, you, anyone) won't get ban even with 1-9 rep.(this wasn't even meant like insult lol)\n\n> Now I know the system needs multiple people to ban you because every time I got a ban I was arguing with multiple people.\n\nWhat kind of evidence is this? If we take in count most of the ppl will choose to immediately leave postgame lobby without reporting. It is like saying I beat up group of ppl and one beaten up dude wasn't enough for police to convict(take in count you would prob get higher punishment for beating up multiple ppl, they might need some evidence like video etc. you got point)\n\nSo so far we have official Ritos employee telling us how it works and dude that feel it other way(you can thats your right) \n\n> Neither times I said anything offensive, just plain old arguments with a \"fuck\" here and there... which is why I know its not just words that get you (unless ure dropping bombs)..

One \"fuck\" nor hundred \"fucks\" will get you banned(my record is 73/74), but the classic repeating of report this guy/he is inting/he is toxic/hardstuck... will get you.\n\n> how come when you argue with multiple people with the same words and you know for sure more than 3 people are gonna report you.. and immediately 30 mins after it happens, sure enough you get that ban... then tell me how could you not think the system is mob-biased.

It is just about avoiding certein words. My opinion is that their \"smart\" machine is just vocabulary finding certein words. So you have many ways how to fool them. But you can't fool manual review, that's what you need to know.\n\n> But do I know that its wrong and flawed? yes it is. Because a lot of flamers get away with it, especially if theyre in premades. Lets not even talk about the abusers, like ppl in ranked that will asking everyone to report someone if they start doing bad.\n\nAgain. Evidence? We have your feeling and official statment from Rito. Flamers get away, bcs they are fooling bots. If some1 asking for report, it is stacking up, bcs the 1 or 2 game you will get logs from is just the tip of iceberg.\n\nYou can have your opinion, I can have mine, but yours is wrong lol(thats toxic idc)","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Blåbæret","date":"2018-12-30T15:34:11.493+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"It's unfortunate, but literally ALL Nunu players are toxic.
