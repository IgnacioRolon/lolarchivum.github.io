That's all well and good, but then they never go away, even when the vision effect has ended. I'm not sure if this happens every time on every champion and mode, but I know it happens every time I get Pyke on ARAM. It's kind of impactful, because it makes it hard for me to tell when I'm out of sight for my passive.","replies":[{"poster":"Rotala macrandra","date":"2019-06-10T02:07:44.021+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It happens in ARAM bc of Ashe E.
