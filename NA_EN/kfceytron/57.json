After that, it&#039;s a long slog of pointless battles and events with no mystery or surprise when the stronger team wins again. It&#039;s not fun or exciting being on either end of this.\r\n\r\nAnd why do ~40% of players either not understand this, or enjoy being stomped? Why vote no on a forfeit if your team is down by 30 kills and has lost every single event? Someone please explain what&#039;s enjoyable about walking around for a few seconds and then dying within 1 second, with those times just getting shorter as the game goes on.","replies":[{"poster":"Even","date":"2018-12-11T01:25:30.561+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Comebacks are possible if you can reach Sudden Death, by then it's usually anyones game.

That means selecting a champion from Shurima (this particular one just links to the Shurima web page instead of actually telling me what champs I can pick, like some missions do). The only champion from Shurima that's free while the mission is available is Rengar. I have no interest in playing Rengar. His kit is wonky and buggy and I just can't learn to like it, but that's literally the only champion I can play for this mission. The next mission requires playing one of five assassins. NONE of them are free today, and tomorrow's rotation will have TWO, Akali and Shaco. I played Akali once (the new version) and hated it. I've never played Shaco because his kit doesn't interest me at all.\n\nSo when I have to spend an extra ten minutes in a match that three people consistently want to leave, I would like those two naysayers to explain why we should keep dying. I can't even leave the match early, because that's punishable.","replies":[{"poster":"Fraggleroc","date":"2018-12-11T04:42:14.379+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=KFCeytron,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=PWEdlUVq,comment-id=0000000000000000,timestamp=2018-12-11T02:20:40.486+0000)\n>\n> I&#x27;m trying to do missions.
