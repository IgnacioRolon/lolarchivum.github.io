It's like the entire concept is protected by a Somebody Else's Problem field and it just slips right under the radar. Even when a Mundo is utterly destroying our team and we can only kill him 4v1, even when I ask if anyone's gonna buy GW, even when I mention ten minutes later that we still have no GW items, even when I suggest buying Calling at only 800g (Ashe, Yi, Darius, and Jinx... literally everyone could've bought that), it's crickets. No response. No GW. We ended up throwing nearly a quarter million damage at him before winning at 38 minutes with Elder dragon due to the rest of his team being bad. Even when the enemy team has a Mundo _and_ a Vlad, all the GW we get is Ez buying {{item:3165}} half an hour in... while also having {{item:3036}} rather than {{item:3033}}.\r\n\r\nWhat situation/MMR will cause people to actually get GW?","replies":[]}
