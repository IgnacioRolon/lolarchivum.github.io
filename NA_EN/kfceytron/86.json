Maybe your lobby loads half a second late and everyone else has already called a lane. Maybe your lane goes 13/0 but it doesn't matter because everyone else was feeding the enemy Yi a kill every minute. Maybe your allied Irelia goes 6/8 but the enemy Irelia goes 18/2. Maybe someone on your team decides that early surrender isn't early enough and just leaves.\r\n\r\nThe most tilting thing that happens in bots is that you didn't get quite as many kills as you would've liked before winning the match.\r\n\r\nI don't know how people tolerate this game.","replies":[]}
