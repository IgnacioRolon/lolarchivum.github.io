Giving up isn&#039;t a very positive attitude, but it is a sign that the player understands the mechanics and strategy of the game such that they have a good idea of which Nexus will eventually explode. I know Boards prefers longer matches, but a 25-minute match where the last 10 minutes is spawn camping and spamming emotes is no more of a strategic braingame than one that ends with a unanimous forfeit at 15 minutes. The only interesting gameplay is that required to decide a match, not necessarily complete it.\r\n\r\nRequiring 4 votes to surrender is an insult to a team&#039;s superior players.","replies":[{"poster":"Frosted Tips","date":"2018-12-14T20:28:57.998+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Very few people know when it is \"go next.\" People consistently throw games. That is why in Masters, Grand Masters, and Challenger people know it more often. It is because when you get better at the game you make less mistakes and don't allow for comebacks nearly as often.\n\nThe reason games are over in the first 10 minutes is because of people's mentality. People die once and just give up because they can't carry even if they can get carried by the team they don't care because they are mentally a 4 year old. \"If I can't carry we can't win,\" what is going on in their heads. Significantly more people that play LoL are like this now and that is a part of why average game times have shortened and why less people play tanks.(I know they are a little bit weak right now but still) \n\n**If the community would just stop being 4 years old mentally the game would be a lot more enjoyable for them and for the rest of us, and comebacks would be way more common. So no one knows when to \"go next.\"**","replies":[]},{"poster":"HommeGoujon","date":"2018-12-14T20:21:57.410+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"So unpopular that dozens of threads every week state the same thing. \n\nI see too often ppl in chat \"FF @ 15\" after 2-3 mins.

There is a difference between the merely difficult and the impossible, and some players simply cannot tell the difference. Others can tell at minute 5 that it's a loss, but then teammates force the match to drag out to nearly 20, just because they don't understand how stats, gold, etc. work.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Gravesinger","date":"2018-12-14T20:01:12.787+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't agree with the implication that the FF should require less votes, but I do agree with the general sentiment.
