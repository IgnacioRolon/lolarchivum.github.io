They only play when visiting the actual Imgur page. And when you do click through to that page, it goes to the imgur.com/image_id page that wraps the video, not the i.imgur.com/image_id.gifv direct link that I posted. I get the same result whether I'm posting them in a new thread or as a reply to an existing thread. Here's an example:\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/uD7K2Hk.gifv\n\nMy videos are encoded with H264 in an mp4 container. What do I have to do differently, whether in my Boards post, the video creation process, or the Imgur upload process, to ensure that these work properly?\n\nEDIT: Trying the closing img tag (didn't think it was necessary for gifv):\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/uD7K2Hk.gifv[/img]\n\nEDIT: If you turn your video into a gif so Imgur can turn it _back_ into a video, it'll autoplay, but if it's the first post of a thread, you'll still have that big Imgur wrapper in the preview, apparently. I've even seen jpgs from Imgur fail on Boards nowadays, though, so I guess that's a thing.","replies":[{"poster":"michaelchan","date":"2018-12-08T19:44:06.788+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm at a loss.
