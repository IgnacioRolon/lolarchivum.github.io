Why do you think Riot doesn&#x27;t make this bannable? You&#x27;re wrong, you just don&#x27;t know how to take criticism. \n> \n> Work on it bro /end discussion.\n> \n> Good luck on the summoners rift!\n\nI'm getting downvoted because there are many people in this \"community\" who enjoy being rude and thus highly value the avenues to do so that are available to them. Saying that a match was \"easy\" is a concise way for a rude person to tell the enemy team that they are good and the enemy team is bad, whether the game was close or one-sided, and whether it was decided by a large skill gap, a small skill gap, luck, disconnects, etc. It's completely non-constructive. What is someone supposed to do with that information? Get better? That's already a goal for most players. And if they do get better, why, there'll be someone in the next elo up who'll take the mantle of saying \"ez,\" so they can be informed once again that they're bad at the game and should stop being bad. \"You suck\" and \"you need to work on control ward placement\" are both criticism, but one is constructive while the other is not. I'll leave you to puzzle out which one is which.\n\nGood luck on the Rift!","replies":[{"poster":"AeroWaffle","date":"2018-12-26T11:57:12.682+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=KFCeytron,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=QAdGWgfj,comment-id=000200000000000000000000,timestamp=2018-12-26T11:31:16.007+0000)\n>\n> I&#x27;m getting downvoted because there are many people in this &quot;community&quot; who enjoy being rude and thus highly value the avenues to do so that are available to them.\n\nI downvoted because I don't like the idea.

Second, if the attitude I'm seeing in this thread continues its prevalence, there will be some unsportsmanlike players who say \"ez\" _in every elo_. I've even seen a clip of Sneaky flashing over a Yasuo tornado to get a kill followed by _his teammate flaming him for being bad and wasting Flash_. Is Sneaky bad? I don't really think so. He may not be the best player ever, but he's a professional, one of the top players in the world, and people still tell him he's bad.\n\nOh, and when he saw someone telling him he was bad, he instantly went from elation at Flashing the tornado and getting a kill to dully going back to CSing.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"EL HAMSTERO","date":"2018-12-27T05:52:20.617+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"\"he was unsportsmanlike to me! he should lose his account!\"\n\ngrow up dude","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Highest Noon","date":"2018-12-26T18:17:22.051+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Like, saying EZ when it's an one-sided game isn't insulting.
