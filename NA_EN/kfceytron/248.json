The system can somehow detect that. Good job, program! But why is that system so bad at determining when someone was running it down mid? I would think that'd be a lot more obvious and thus easier to detect.\r\n\r\nhttps://i.imgur.com/0I94mDT.png[]\r\n\r\nhttps://i.imgur.com/zMh6DlZ.png[]","replies":[{"poster":"GatekeeperTDS","date":"2019-07-18T11:09:38.112+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":2,"body":"Occam's razor - the simplest explanation is quite often the best explanation. In this case, the simplest explanation as to why the system \"is inconsistent\" with detection is that **intentional feeding is inconsistent,** or rather, the actions people can take that would be counted as intentional feeding are not cut and dry.\n\nYour case of 24 deaths running it down mid is **probably** cut and dry, but this is an extreme outlier of an example. Remember, **one single death** fed intentionally counts as intentional feeding. How do we detect all of those? And how to we reduce false positives?\n\nYou're coming at this problem in an intelligent manner, which is a far cry from the **ZOMG RITO NEVER PUNISHES INTERS** shit that we have to deal with here on a daily basis. But when asked, I don't think any of us could come up with the programming necessary to detect intentional feeding in all cases, even in all **egregious** cases.\n\nTake your example here. Thresh died 24 times, but his team is fed as fuck. Could he legitimately be intentionally feeding? Absolutely, and probably even likely. But since he has 12 assists **and** his team is fed as fuck, is there also a chance he was dying so his team could crush them in team fights **over and over**? Absolutely.\n\nSion, Zilean, and Garen's scores are comically bad compared to the winning team.

It's a matter of proof.  Feeding is not punishable unless its intentional and then its punished much harsher than toxicity.   Proving its intentional is the issue.\n\nA speeding ticket is easy.  You go over the speed limit, they can show the speed gun and you get a ticket.   That's chat punishments.\n\nIf you pull into an intersection and cause an accident,  you are ticketed for failure to yield.  If you pulled into the intersection because you wanted to make someone die, that's attempted murder (even if no one is hurt). The question is... how do you prove the intent?  Unless there is a pattern over several accidents or the driver admits his intent, there is no way to tell the difference.   That's intentional feeding.","replies":[{"poster":"MissedYourQ","date":"2019-07-18T15:44:43.706+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":6,"body":"I understand that it's hard to prove it but it's also sad that a 115m playerbase game still doesn't have the technology to fight feeders.

If there weren't,  no one would get fed and there would only be a couple kills per team.  \n\nI'm assuming you are are referring to intentional feeding, which I've seen one obvious case in three years. (I see my share of afk and rage quitting but not inting.) It dosen't mean they are not there, but if they are trying to avoid punishment then they act the same as a bad player and you can't catch that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DuskDaUmbreon","date":"2019-07-18T15:57:01.591+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's not a question of the playerbase, the money, the employees, or any of that.\n\nThe issue is simply feasibility.
