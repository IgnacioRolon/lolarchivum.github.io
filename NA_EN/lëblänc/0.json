I can usually beat him with mordekaiser but if im ganked I lose lane, and in the end get outscaled. People say play rumble, been there done that, early game minions rape me when I punish him, and once hes level six its wither, im dead.  People say gank him early game! Once he is level six hes in late game, He has unlimited sustain especially with the new runes, and going out of my way for a bramble vest or executioneers calling/ qss etc. is god damn expensive, I mean late game u can&#039;t baby sit him all game so his stacks will go out the roofs, in team fights he needs to be focused because he does the same amount of damage as the adc, I am just utterly upset and confused on who to play against him, the only thing I can think of is GP and Jayce, oh and if i have first pick I cant just farm under tower,  because all he has to do is press r and he takes no damage...

That's not expensive, and can be acquired on your first back if an early gank doesn't push you out of lane.\n\nWhat champions do you play against him?  Besides Morde and Rumble you haven't mentioned many champions you have tried.\n\nAlso how good are you at managing a minion wave?  Keeping it frozen on your side of the lane is the single best thing you can do against Nasus.","replies":[{"poster":"Azadethe","date":"2018-02-21T04:47:37.373+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"But.....{{item:3123}} is going to put you behind in a trade vs a {{item:3057}} in a 1v1 at level 6, especially with Nasus's added 50% Q reduction on ult.\n\nThat's primarily why it's not working on champs that are \"supposed\" to counter him. You might get him low with an Executioner early game, but you're still going to lose the 1v1, and mid/late game it'll only really help in team fights where you 1v3.\n\nNow...... in 8.4 mages will be able to perma Grievous wounds him, so that's something. I could probably 1v1 him with Morgana then, or especially Karma, since I can RW him and just keep taunting him with grievous pokes \n\n(One of my favorite top lanes is Grasp of the Undying Karma vs Nasus while rushing a {{item:3091}} ; As long as you keep Grasp active it's a super easy lane, because Nasus just has to keep going in to farm stacks, and every time, you'll gain a stack of grasp; I've had 75 stacks in one game. The key is the Wit's helps negate any mag resist he tries to buy and makes your pokes even stronger, while conserving mana for actual all ins. I've had Nasus down to 50 stacks in 10:00 using this, so it's about as effective as a Teemo. Once Morello is a perma high HP grievous, this build can get monstrous, because I can get it early enough that Nasus won't be able to counter it. And yes; This is actually a RANKED build).","replies":[{"poster":"redniwediS","date":"2018-02-21T04:51:27.808+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If I go executioners over bramble I usually start longsword with three potions, so it won't put me as far behind.  Bramble vest is the safest option of the bunch, and doesn't set you behind.\n\nPersonally I'm expecting 8.4 to gutter many melee top laners, at least at the start.","replies":[{"poster":"Azadethe","date":"2018-02-21T06:37:39.193+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think so too, because mages who can afford to buy Morello early are going to be dangerous. Vlad for example..... will just erode top lane melee presence.\n\nPersonally I plan to use it to erode bot lane and make adcs squeal that Morg/Zyra OP as I power spike before they do.\n\nUnfortunately I'm probably going to have to rethink my Evelynn build, as she generally wouldn't morello early, and I don't think Archangel rush is going to be expedient on her because of the price. Could GLP, but for some reason I hate the Gun's mechanic. \n\nI'll prob stick to {{item:1039}} {{item:3092}} {{item:3115}} {{item:3100}}  as it seems to work pretty well. I'm just concerned about how it's gonna nerf her using Ravenous Hunter. She's going to have a need to get out of fights much earlier, which isn't always possible with CC.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Crett","date":"2018-02-21T04:25:52.456+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:48}} {{champion:31}}?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Brotha","date":"2018-02-21T12:02:18.410+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He's too strong right now.

I could be wrong but Nasus is one of those champs that you just have to end the game early or get your team to coordinate ganks on him constantly while also working on other lanes and towers.  That's too much to ask in a game with random people.  If you absolutely have to play against him, armor/magic pen , {{champion:17}} shrooming the lane and preventing him from pushing a single lane or {{champion:2}} with his ult and true damage can probably help you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ßøss","date":"2018-02-21T05:04:10.334+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{item:3047}} {{item:3076}} gg you have now reduced his Q dmg and gut his sustain.\nAlso Nasus most of the time will likely to afk top instead of grouping if hes competent\nbecause he knows he will get kited in teamfights use that to your advantage who ever\nyou are playing and forced those 4v5 fights in your favor while hes splitting top.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AlienPrimate","date":"2018-02-21T04:43:50.914+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like Taric against Nasus.
