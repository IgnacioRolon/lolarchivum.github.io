Every single time I have played with a Yasuo on the enemy team he always seemed to get fed.  I think he is a very imbalanced champion in general with a &quot;block anything, and don&#039;t waste money on crit passive&quot; with an indestructible wall of... wind, insane movement/ movement impairing abilities that all seem to be able to crit you...  Every time I play against yasuo I can never counter him, I mean sure I may not select the right champion but I mean its nothing like playing against any other champ, I can play well against any champion but Yasuo, middle or top either way I always seem to do fine... So, how exactly do I counter Yasuo in general?","replies":[{"poster":"Kitsunes Lust","date":"2018-01-10T04:46:20.762+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"think about his kit. his Q can be used twice on-hit to activate a tornado and his E is what makes him crazy mobile. and his R activates on knockup. Now, how do you beat that in lane? firstly, play safe. stay as safe as you possibly can. secondly, let him abuse himself and abuse his greatest strength and turn it into his greatest weakness.\n\nHe is extremly mobile and very dangerous...when there's allied minions around. he REALLY need something to hit, and that something is mostly minions.  let him push and if he does not have any minions, he cannot E, making him lose most of his mobility as well, therefore actually limiting his Q to only you, removing his E since he can't dash, and making his R non-existent. he needs something to hit with his Q and E. you have no minions, he can't really do anything except try to attack you, and if he gets greedy with no minons around, that's free turret shots on him. his greatest strength is his ultimate weakness. That's just my idea tho on how to beat yasuo. let him play himself by letting him get rid of all your minions. without your minions, he's only left with AAs. oh and throw in 1 aa before bursting him. any kind of damage will activate his passive, and once that's  down he has no sheild, and he can't grow that sheild fast if he doesn't have a E to use on minons","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pandemic Punch","date":"2017-10-18T06:46:07.515+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:27}}  {{champion:90}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Primaquarius","date":"2017-10-14T03:53:48.895+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If I play Morgana into a Yasuo, basically I auto him every chance I get to keep his Ability down (do this less if youre next to allied minions of course).

Drag his ass out of lane so his mobility becomes gimped then focus him down. Good way to do this if he is mid is to pressure river objectives.\n3. Play him for a few weeks till you have a good feel for his Q,W,E and R cast time, cool downs, and ranges, this will help you know if you in a safe distance or danger zone in future matches vs him.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LëBlänc","date":"2017-10-14T04:39:06.871+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IS IT NORMAL TO GO 1/6/8 IN A MORDE VS GNAR GAME AS MORDE?

Yas needs your minions for his mobility, Other than that he is just another immobile melee. \n\nHe's squishy and is very weak to CC thus can be easily bursted. Yasuo players hate playing against good {{champion:1}} players. Her 575 auto-attack range can easily pop his shield and could even harass him at early levels. Annie has a point-and-click CC wither Disintegrate(Q) and it's very easy to bait out his Windwall. Annie's Incinerate(W) and Summon:Tibbers(R) passes through his windwall. Annie also has her Molten Shield(E) that gives damage reduction and ala-thornmail passive since Yasuo's an autoattack champion.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Friendly Ram","date":"2017-10-14T03:54:15.483+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"BE OK{{champion:33}} .\n\nwhat types of champs do you prefer?","replies":[]}]}
