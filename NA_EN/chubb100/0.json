If I /mute all every game, I won't even see if someone is toxic. Then, instead of not being punished when I report them, they will not be punished when I don't report them, which just saves me the pain of enduring their toxicity. But then, my forgiveness kicks in, and I foolishly think, \"I won't do it this game. The community can't be that bad, right?\" Then I am faced with the harsh realization that the community is, in fact, that bad, and I'm greeted with a teammate telling me to kill myself, then I rant on the boards and my post gets removed, then whine a little bit about how reporting does nothing, and then, I just repeat the entire cycle.\n\nI honestly think League of Legends is decreasing my life span because of all the stress it causes me.","replies":[{"poster":"chubb100","date":"2016-11-06T17:16:06.575+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ya, there is no way I would use teamspeak.

Sometimes you do miss important things your team does (some people don't use pings all the much, but at least disabling all chat is a absolutely a must in general. Your team might say things you don't wanna miss, but that's definitely not the case with the enemy team.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Whamboozler","date":"2016-11-06T17:30:00.720+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I usually stick with /mute all but I might take your suggestion.
