I tried helping by auto attacking only but it was just feeding. I really hope you guys can take this bug serious because I and many other people who might experience this bug again won't get punished as a feeder or afk. This bug happened 3 times now  to me and I see zero solutions on how to fix it.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-09T22:07:13.098+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmm it sounds like your hotkeys aren't being downloaded from the servers correctly, or maybe they were saved incorrectly server side which keeps loading incorrect keybindings. Let's give those a hard reset with these steps, and let me know if it doesn't help!\n\n- Log into the game client\n- Navigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\\n- Delete the folder named **Config**\n- Go into a practice game and verify that settings have saved properly. \n- Leave game to sync settings","replies":[]}]}
