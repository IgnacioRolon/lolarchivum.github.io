It was about my account been hacked today. I already submitted a ticked about it but it was under \"I need help recovering my account\" but the person from RiotGames who deleted my post suggested the ticket to be under “I have a question About League of Legends/Riot Games” and the thing is that I cant get login to make another report about it under that because the person who hacked me changed my password and email and i can't recover it. So my question is if my request is still going to be evaluated even though it was requested under \"I need help recovering my account\" ?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-26T22:59:58.089+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, your ticket will still be received and addressed by a specialist regardless of the category you selected. \n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}
