I own every single champion in the game and dozens of skins, many of which are legacy. I&#039;ve bought more monthly bundles than I care to admit, as well as over 13 rune pages and a plethora of special event icons, ward skins and IP boosts.\r\n\r\nI&#039;ve probably spent a few thousand dollars on this game over the past 3 years. And although that might just be a small blip on the radar of your sales figures, I would like to think my contributions have earned the right to be called a &quot;valued customer&quot;.\r\n\r\nYou have until the end of this day, November 2nd El Dia De Los Muertos, to make a more public statement about the Harrowing than a private post on PBE boards that not everyone can access.\r\n\r\nYou NEED to show you give a shit about the VAST majority of players who care more about the Harrowing than the LC$.  Continuing to ignore our complaints over this past week and placing a gag order on your employees to make sure they do not talk to us shows me that you don&#039;t give a shit about your customers.\r\n\r\nI for one am not going to allow you to get away with it. If you do not give us an explanation in a public announcement in regards to the Harrowing, you&#039;ve lost me as a customer for life. I will uninstall your game on November 3rd and you will never again get another penny from me or anyone I know personally who plays this game.\r\n\r\nYour move Riot. You need to remember and appreciate the players that brought you to the eSports dance to begin with and GAVE you the money you needed to become the gaming giant you are today. Or will you send the message that you clearly don&#039;t need your customers anymore?","replies":[]}
