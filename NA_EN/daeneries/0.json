Wanting to play Veigar, he tries to get mid and fails, going jungle instead after some encouragement from me. I try to get top because Rumble is the only champion I know on the free rotation, but another guy gets it and I end up with support. I choose Zilean. I had played him once during my pre-thirty levels so I knew how he functioned, but I was no master of his kit. I wasn't quite sure how to optimally use his time reset, and I wasn't the best at hitting bombs. Choosing whether to slow people or speed them up was also an issue.\nWe, bot lane, die at level two because I misuse my abilities. I apologize to my marksman, a Draven. Draven curses me out, telling me how I lost him lane. I tell him that his cs is better than Kog's and that this is just early game, we can come back.\nWe come back to lane, fight a bit more, then get ganked by Master Yi. Another double kill for bot lane. (Dang, I suck at this champion.)\n\"NOOB SUPPORT U LOST ME LANE\" \"I am a noob, it's my first time on this champ\" \"U LOST ME LANE\" \"Want me to go somewhere else\" \"YES U BAD, I CARRY ALONE\"\nCurse words omitted.\n\nDraven keeps getting killed, and eventually he starts blaming Annie, the opposing support, for babysitting Kog'Maw. \n\"IF U 1V1 ME I WIN\" - \"U JUST HAVE ANNIE CAMPING YOUR butt\"\n\"im better than you, i will win\" \n\"ONLY BECAUSE MY NUB SUPPORT AND CAMPING ANNIE\"\n\nThen he remembers my words.\n\"LOOK MY CS BETTER THAN YOURS\" \n\"i have more kills\" \n\"U KILL NOOB SUPPORT\"\n\nMeanwhile, I'm supporting our Nasus.

Kog'Maw said he would do so as well. (I did not ask him, or anybody else aside from my friend, to.)\nAs we queue up for the next blind pick, this time on Twisted Treeline, we get the report message. _Yesss._\n\nhttp://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/2227213855/232923076?tab=overview","replies":[{"poster":"1010101010286","date":"2016-09-14T02:02:40.355+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"lol.. says hes played zilean before and then says it's his first time playing him. smurfing from bronze because you don't understand a spell that lowers cooldowns by 10 seconds or something???","replies":[{"poster":"Aeszarck","date":"2016-09-14T02:10:53.362+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=1010101010286,realm=NA,application-id=Ir7ZrJjF,discussion-id=iVAWq5MY,comment-id=000d0000,timestamp=2016-09-14T02:02:40.355+0000)\n>\n> lol.. says hes played zilean before and then says it&#x27;s his first time playing him. smurfing from bronze because you don&#x27;t understand a spell that lowers cooldowns by 10 seconds or something???\n\nYeah, I played him once a year ago. I didn't feel like typing out the \"first time in awhile\" because I decided that my experience from a year ago was basically worthless, and the worth of my knowledge wasn't worth the extra second typing. I knew what his spells did, but I forgot how to optimally use them. (I never knew in the first place, to be honest. I was clueless the first time and only time I played him.)\n\nI understood all of the spells, including his cooldown reducer. I'm not stupid. (Not all Bronze players are stupid either. They just don't have the game knowledge or the mechanics to progress in rank.) What I did not understand were the good times to double bomb and the good times to use a double slow or a slow and speed up or a double speed up, so I floundered. That knowledge was not stuff that I picked up from my first game a year and a half ago, or knowledge that I was able to discern by reading the tooltips. I did not look up a guide before the game, unfortunately, because I was hoping I would get Rumble.\nI'm Silver, and as I said, I was smurfing because I wanted to play with my low leveled friend without making him go against more experienced level 20's. I gradually found out that I elevated his MMR to that of a smurf's by playing with him as a smurf, but now I'm not sure whether to smurf with him and make him face other smurfs, or play normally with him and make him face high levels.\n\nWhy did you downvote?
