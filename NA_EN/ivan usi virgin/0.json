Swain&#039;s snare duration is now 1/1.25/1.5/1.75/2 seconds. Lux&#039;s snare on the other hand lasts 2 seconds at all levels. Swain&#039;s ranked winrate as of february 15th is 49.50% with a 1.95% pickrate while Lux&#039;s winrate is 53.49% with a 24.12% pickrate. why is it that Swain has to have his snare nerfed but not Lux? i know riot likes some champions more than others which is why their game is so fucking unbalanced right now, but i think it&#039;d be fairly reasonable to give Lux&#039;s snare the same treatment that they gave Swain, since she&#039;s so damn strong right now.","replies":[{"poster":"Blumpkin Nation","date":"2016-02-18T04:25:47.853+0000","up_votes":35,"down_votes":13,"body":"Well, I mean.

I know its good to have champions that can go different roles, but seriously, Lux is ridiculous. She scales so well with AP, she's played mid a lot.

Most Luxes on support suffer no penalty for building like they're going mid when supporting. Everything but their gold input will be just fine, but since they just farm champions their adc can farm while they get kills/assists.\n\nI mean, just look at how much damage Lux does when compared to champions like Lulu, or Janna. Like, just look at the kit differences. Lux has high utility normal skills, with some pretty ridiculous ratios, and a high-damage execute ult with a high range (NOTE: NOT REALLY AN ACTUAL EXECUTE). Janna and Lulu have ALL utility skills. Lulu has no moves that just do straight up damage, other than maybe Help Pix casted on an enemy, but that still gives you vision of them and moves Pix for plays. Her ult is massive utility and can give any champion an engage, but doesn't do TONS OF DAMAGE. Janna's ult is the opposite; she knocks enemies away, and HEALS allies around her. These are \"normal\" caster support champions. Even Morgana scales differently with support items; her burst can get a little out of control in the late game, but Lux does pretty hefty damage during the mid, late, and sometimes even early game, if she can get the kills going.\n\nWow, this thread made me realize I hate Lux more than Morgana.
