For instance youre trying to force us to play AP ekko, AD assassin zed, things like tthat.  So why cant i go full AD tank ekko if i want to and have it be viable? Doesnt this force this game down a path where it becomes stail if we know everytime anyone plays a champ their build? Wasnt that half the fun ? Playing weird shit like AP tank jayce if we wanted to?\r\n\r\nim pretty sure thats how AP yi, warwick, tryndamere, all worked + it gave different options to focus around. Like his ULT might be weak since AD scaling, but QWE is good ap ratios giving you some different build combos you might potentially take up? I hate how like i just play EKKO the way riot wants to now with the itemization \"thats good\" on him since no other build can win anymore. I feel its the same for most champions and i get that they are a certain role, a certain damage type/character type. Like you wouldnt play assassins as tanks DUH and effectively get to challenger but you could have fun at low levels.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-08-03T01:51:02.435+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"AP yi was incredibly broken.\nTankko was incredibly broken.\nAD tank fizz was incredibly broken.\nAP warwick was.. just.. please, never again. \n\nThe changes make them balanced instead of overpowered.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Juggernaut628","date":"2016-08-03T01:43:56.806+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you can't win on tank Ekko, that's your problem. It's nowhere near as strong as it was, but it is still quite strong.
