My computer should be more then enough to run the game at max settings, with zero problem. It's a laptop. a MX14 I think that's the name. An Alienware. It has an i5, and a 750m graphics card inside. We play guildwars and some other games on it too. I just don't understand why it isn't playing League how it should. I can turn the settings all the way down and only get 40 fps. In team fights I'll get 3 or 4. I literally have to run from team fights, it's sad. \r\n\r\nNow, I think it might have something to do with my charging adapter. It says \"this adapter is not support and will continue to run off of battery\", basically it means it wont charge. I get power, but it's basically direct from the outlet. But I do have custom settings turned on to where it's always in performance mode. I know with alienware if it isn't plugged in, the gpu isn't suppose to turn on. Though, it should be working as far as I know. At least, I would think it would be in performance mode. The drivers for the gpu were out dated. So I updated them. Ran a system update, nothing. Cleaned the computer up too. I really need some help to make this function properly.\r\n\r\nThe client also runs slow too. Down to the point that I lag behind about 4 to 5 fps.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-04T17:50:08.224+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As *Hyperion* mentioned, there were some recent updates to Windows 10 that may be causing your issue. One of the biggest pain points as of recent has been the Windows Game Bar, which was recently given an updated feature called *Game DVR*. This feature has been causing issues, so I recommend [disabling the game bar entirely](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html) to see if it resolves the issues for you.\n\nLet me know if this helped.","replies":[]},{"poster":"hyperion3182","date":"2016-10-02T12:55:45.514+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello, are you a Windows 10 user who got a recent W10 Anniversary update?
