Such as.\n\n- Removing his unnecessary spellvamp on an AD-champion, I can't think of one other AD champion that has **5%-25% FREE Spellvamp **built into their kit.\n- Give him an actual punishment for missing his Q, remove his passive energy restoration and tie it to his Q second cast and give the first cast of his Q a high energy cost, this will make it so that dodge his first Q won't just mean he can ward hop and then tempest your ass or flash-kick you with his 350 movement speed . . . speaking of which. \n- Reduce his movement speed to 340, there is absolutely no logic reason a champion as mobile as him needs 350 movement speed.\n- Reduce the base damage of his ultimate, why in the name of God does his ult do **200/400/600 (+200% Bonus AD) to his intial target and every further target struck, knocking his first target back and all other targets in the air?**\n- Give his ult a meaningful cooldown, his ult is arguably one of the best ultimates (by far in the top 5) in the game. It's a nuke, it can peel, it can be used to engage, it has so many uses with no downsides to using it (Besides being a trash lee sin and kicking a kill away, which isn't a big deal if you know how to land his Q that travels at the speed of light).  **90 / 75 / 60 seconds,** come on you guys can do better then that. Make it 115/95/80 Seconds, that way you have to think when you use it. \n- Don't allow his tempest to reveal stealth champions anymore, just remove it it's toxic as hell. Like, he already has such great physical damage scalings and if he gets fed earlygame and you're a smart player that decides to build some armor to survive him SCREW YOU his tempest does great aoe magic damaged that scales with 100% of his Bonus AD.","replies":[{"poster":"Rozzeta","date":"2015-01-17T15:07:21.255+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":0,"body":"Olaf had Spellvamp in his W.

In the previous season lee was king because the only really viable path was buff small camp buff gank. Lee was really good at that and he could decide to do red and go to your 2nd buff to kill you or force you out. You can outplay that now. He can't take your red early with impunity because you will catch him and he will be low.\nThis jungle is slightly more reminiscent of s1 or s2 where there actually was strategic diversity that was deeper than just the ganks and relied heavily on efficiency and wider game control in a sense. That was heavily reduced when they first changed the jungle in s3 and persisted through S4. \nYou basically have a lot more choices to make right now and that adds depth to gameplay. \nThe only champions struggling right now are skill based junglers like ap and tank junglers, because they're really hurting for mana, since they first deleted all mana back jungle items and secondly nerfed mana regen. You know things like amumu who uses half his freaking mana bar for a Q ult.\n\nP.S Lee can't be balanced around ward hops at all. My suggestion posted on these boards before was removing his ward hop ability, revert his last set of nerfs that deleted attack speed slow from his E so he can be THE all around duelist but a) needs a friendly unit to escape trouble or has to use flash and b) has to use flash for his \"insec\" combo which would be balanced because it'd be gated by the long cd of flash. (right now it's balanced around the ult CD).\nThe proposed change would effect the game doubly because now he wouldn't be rushing sightstone for free mobility and map-wide ward control","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DatKiva","date":"2015-01-18T00:54:04.625+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"its cause of the skill ceiling, a good lee sin can shit on reksai","replies":[{"poster":"Chessburger","date":"2015-01-18T02:54:38.359+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Assuming about equal skill lvl...

Very easy to kite and again has some form of counterplay (Maybe not in lane, but general any ranged character that plays safe can survive).\n\nPantheon's Q costs an hilariously high amount of mana, literally if he tries to abuse it earlygame he goes oom. Heartseeker is channeled and can be avoided.\n\nAll your points are invalid, the problem with Lee is that his scalings are to much of an icing on the cake. His ultimate to be specific, it deals 200/400/600 (+200% Bonus AD) to his target struck, and knocks them back a mile and also deals the same damage to all enemies they collide with while knocking them airborne. While costing NOTHING and having a 90/75/60 Second cooldown . . . it's embarrassingly broken.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"JJI744","date":"2015-01-17T21:01:58.436+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Silents429,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=uJb5lXZ6,comment-id=000a,timestamp=2015-01-17T19:12:51.073+0000)\n>\n> Well those are his legit scalings?
