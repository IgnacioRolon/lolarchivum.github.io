Have no idea what they want Cassiopeia to even be as they&#039;ve attempted to turn her into a late game hyper carry but neglect the fact she&#039;s an immobile mage that relies on poisons and \n2. Have had no real care about Cassiopeia since her rework and arguably even before it.  \n\n**But never mind the fact this rework is a colossal failure and has been since its release on many different factors, never mind the fact that Riot has given a giant middle finger F U to dedicated Cassiopeia players that have given solid feedback to this &quot;rework&quot;, let&#039;s dicuss why Cassiopeia is a massive flop yet again. **\n\n____\n\n**Probably the biggest problem with Cassiopeia that has been stated so many times at this point my human brain cannot fathom the number is that it takes TO LONG FOR HER TO BE USEFUL. ** Riot has gone out their way to turn Cassiopeia into a late game hyper carry but have completely made it so that her late game hyper carry scaling is depended on a time passive that takes forever to stack, is completely boring in every sense of the word, and unnecessary for the same exact reason. Meanwhile actual hyper carry&#039;s like Veigar, Azir, Ryze etc can reach their late game power spike faster and in some cases offer MORE then what Cassiopeia can in a shorter time frame. \n\n____\n\n**Cassiopeia&#039;s core identity has been completely butchered for some man&#039;s hard on for stacking passives. ** Cassiopeia&#039;s core identity use to be one thing no matter how you played her and that was - debilitation: weakening her enemies downed. But ever since this joke of a passive has been introduced nearly all of her AP ratios have been completely gutted to compensate for the massive amounts of unneeded AP she&#039;ll receive later on in the game. What you&#039;re left with is a champion that is pretty damn shallow and is nothing but a pathetic shadow of her former self. I kid you not, I have had mid laners literally **stand inside my miasma and laugh because the damage is that pathetic it&#039;s taunt worthy and I don&#039;t blame them.** When you have a champion who&#039;s poisons, which are core to the kit, are such a goddamn joke that the only threat they offer to your opponent is causing them to start choking on their sour patch kids because of how laughable the damage output is you know something is wrong. \n\n____\n\n**Cassiopeia is continually neglected. ** There is absolutely not debate here, this is the most **NEGLECTED REWORK EVER.** There have been countless ideas on how to improve Cassiopeia to make her overall a healthier champion and more fun experience in the game, but all of this has been neglected. Hilariously, even the person that reworked her has, for a majority of the rework, completely ignored her fan base and did whatever the hell he saw fit and had in his insane little mind. Why Riot has completely decided to abandon Cassiopeia for so long is beyond me, but I still find it pretty pathetic that they have done this to her player base when all we&#039;ve asked for is someone to fucking look at her and fix the problems we list over and over. Is that so much to ask for Riot? A champion we&#039;ve grown attached to and purchased every skin for, enjoyed countless hours on, and crafted memories with to simply be made somewhat viable again and less of a colossal piss off whenever you play her? \n\n____\n\n**Cassiopeia&#039;s rework was never called for. ** I personally cannot think of one time when anyone ever has stated that Cassiopeia needs a rework, literally whenever I would ask someone what they would change about Cassiopeia (pre-rework anyway) I would always get a reply along the lines of QOL changes, fixing her ultimate, and maybe making miasma a little bigger so its somewhat more of a threat in large team fights. But nonetheless, I've **never heard anyone say that Cassiopeia needed a rework** and now that I think about it I believe that Cassiopeia, pre rework, was probably one champion that was one of the most least complained mid laners in the game if not the most. This rework was a colossal turd that was melded into a rework and presented to us as if we are suppose to take it seriously and just live with it, but I can&#039;t do that anymore. \n\n____\n\n**Riot, it&#039;s time to give Cassiopeia a full relaunch or either revert her back to her pre-rework state and work from there. ** You don&#039;t think her play style is healthy? Fine, relaunch her into something entirely different as long as she keeps debilitation in her kit I won&#039;t mind but keeping this piece of trash in the game is blatant disrespect to her fans and a slap in the face to anyone that has loved Cassiopeia since release. \n\nSincerely, \n\nA disappointed Cassiopeia player.","replies":[{"poster":"RiotRepertoir","date":"2016-01-18T23:14:49.122+0000","up_votes":58,"down_votes":0,"body":"> relaunch her into something entirely different as long as she keeps debilitation in her kit I won't mind\n\nWhat does \"debilitation\" mean to you? I see suggestions like this come up from Cass players pretty often, but it's usually not followed by much more than wanting DoTs to be emphasized on the kit, and Twin Fang to be de-emphasized. Do keep in mind I'm not saying this is incorrect. However, I do hope that if we were to do poisons or \"debilitation\" better, it would manifest in a way that wasn't just stronger DoTs. Unique debuffs? Time delayed afflictions? More CC? Is it simply that you want your Q to be stronger in lane?\n\nPlease do keep it civil from this point forward.

Simply giving poisoned champions a purple lifebar during the duration of their ailment would be the first best step to improve the overall experience, and it wouldn't even be an issue balancewise.\n\nNow if we're talking gameplaywise, you'd definitely need to put more focus on the rest of her kit. Being dependent on spamming a single ability isn't very interesting, especially if said ability is extremely limited in its usage due to extreme manacosts, restricted range and the fact that you have to stand still to even cast it. \n\nBy either increasing the ratios on her other abilities or by allowing them to stack with each other (as some sort of combo-system) would make them so much more enjoyable to use. By putting more emphasis on her skillshots you'd also make her far more healthy, those skillshots happen to be her poison abilities. Oh, also PLEASE try making her ultimate more reliable to use this time - it's an unholy mess right now due to its short range and awful cast-delay. Heck, just by putting a poison-effect on it you'd make her far more viable at following up.\n\nAlso we aren't angry at you (well, not with you at least, but I can't guarantee the same for Stashu), we're simply disappointed that Cassiopeia and her issues have been left untouched for so long. We're merely asking for some tweaks to bridge the time until that rework finally is ready which is probably going to take half a year, that's simply too long for us if we're planning to play this champion until then.

The rest of Riot knows that, too. The rest of the playerbase knows that, too. No one else will admit it, but I don't care about that.

And that's very vague, and the discussions don't get past that for one reason or another. Communication is a two way street, but the upset from her fans is understandable even so, right?\n\nPower fantasy/general sh'tuff below:\n\nOkay, so, we want a poison mage. That can mean a lot of things. First is that Cassiopeia's poison abilities ought to have impactful damage. But, for me, it's about the poison being powerful, one way or another. At least personally, my fantasy is to see Cassiopeia's poisons slowly, but **surely,** eating away her opponent's health bar. Her poison abilities, at least IMO, do not necessarily have to have big AOE, low cooldowns, etc. but **they need to be powerful on their own instead of just enabling her E spam.**\n\nOne thing I thought of was trying to capture what a \"snake\" champion would be. Like, what about having Cassiopeia chip away with her poisons... Q...W...Q->E...W... QEEEEEEEE! And then, once their low, all in them with Twin Fang. So, she hangs back until her opponent is weakened, and then she makes her move. That would be snakelike... Granted, I don't know how to do that, but it would be really cool to be able to incorporate a power fantasy like that. And, maybe it would work to entice both sides of her fanbase that like the poisony aspect as well as the side which likes her DPS with her Twin Fang. Assuming her kit's all the same. Maybe a partial/full rework is in order. (But maybe not too)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBalancey/Specific Stuff:\n\nCassiopeia's current passive is crap. It exists solely to prevent her from reaching her power. It feels terrible because you can't even interact with it. It's just... there. Other hypercarries are gated by items, and hell, so is Cassiopeia. She doesn't need this gated timer to cripple her for 40 minutes on top of that. It feels awful because it's just something you wait around for.\n\nNot to mention, it's incredibly undynamic compared to other \"Evolution\" passives. You can't choose WHAT to evolve, (Viktor/Kha'Zix) and nothing actually evolves either. You just get... stats. (Her passive IS a ball of stats, btw. Because Riot doesn't like those)\n\nI think Rengar has a similar passive with his Bonetooth necklace, but he has another passive to go along with it, right? If you want to keep this passive, there should be another passive that Cassiopeia can utilize and interact with throughout the game.\n\nAs for her kit itself...  there's not much to say since it functions much like it did before. Just want a kit that has it's power more easily spread out. Her poisons should be as strong, if not stronger, than her E.\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n...And, on the whole, Cassiopeia is portrayed as a very sly, even shrewd character. She's also very cunning and manipulative too. Deceptive. Her lore and VO paint her as such. Her VO also has her talk mostly about her poisons. It doesn't make much thematic sense for her to be a brawley, in your face, 1 v 1 kind of champion. She should be about wearing away her opponents, and striking when they're weak.","replies":[{"poster":"RiotRepertoir","date":"2016-01-19T03:45:05.764+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Her poison abilities, at least IMO, do not necessarily have to have big AOE, low cooldowns, etc. but they need to be powerful on their own instead of just enabling her E spam.\n\nThis seems to be a pretty common opinion I've read.

I came into this thread with the objective of learning what kinds of directional changes players are interested in for Cass.\n\n@RiotRepertoir\n\nI'm an avid Cassiopeia player and I have loved her since her released despite the fact that she really was less than stellar upon her initial release. I have played her quite a bit and I wouldn't say I'm an amazing player, probably about average but an above average cassiopeia player. Despite putting in  nearly 500+ games on her, I still feel weak as hell and as if I can't really do anything on her and thats probably a combination of her poor design and clunky feel.\n\nI think Cassiopeia's design is just fundamentally flawed. The intent of the cassiopeia rework was actually pretty cool, but in terms of practical gameplay I think it just absolutely disintegrates. She is a mid range mage, with zero mobility, a clunky kit, squishy as hell, and has a horrendous early game.  Just from a gameplay sense, this won't ever really be viable for the majority of players. She requires near perfect play to truly reach the pinnacle of gameplay and for the vast majority (like 99.5%) of players it's not obtainable and she fails completely flat on her face. \n\nIt's been said numerous times, but her Noxious Blast and Miasma absolutely need to be buffed, she cannot survive as a champion if these only serve to facilitate her Twin Fang which is her lowest range ability. Not to mention it's very unreliable; Twin Fang reset also calculates travel time, so the further you are away the slower the reset. Given that Miasma poison only lasts for 2 seconds and Noxious Blast for 3 seconds, it only really allows you get off 3 casts of Twin Fang assuming you are max range before you need to reapply poison. If someone were to flash or dash away after you land a poison and twin fang, the travel time actually makes it so that your Twin Fang can end up on cooldown depending on the distance they gain and your travel time. Basically the poison dissipates before you get the reset. This is hugely consequential to her gameplay and actually makes it very difficult for her to get meaningful damage off on some champions or follow up on a kill. \n\nIf her kit is going to be entirely based around the twin fang then she probably needs a bigger window in which she can cast it. I understand the difficulty in balancing this, for example the Twisted Fate gold card nerf a while back is along the same lines; I understand riot doesn't want you to be able to sit on a poison for long periods of time and force people off a wave, but the simple fact that you can only get out 2 or 3 Twin Fangs at maximum per Noxious Blast or Miasma landed is extremely problematic. \n\nIt may seem strange that I consider Cassiopeia a mid-range mage given that her Q is 850 range, W is 850 range, E is 700 range, and ult is 850 range but in game they feel considerably smaller. But given that her Q and W do absolutely nothing in terms of damage, and travel time is a factor in her E reset, she constantly finds herself creeping further and further into fights to do any meaningful damage. Just consider popular champions such as elise or jax. Jax's Leap Strike (Q) is 700 range, Elise Cocoon is 975 range, Morgana Binding 1300 range, etc. Cassiopeia's main damage dealing spell exposes her to getting blown up instantly more often than not. I understand there is a skill component to consider, but she is just so vulnerable so often and to get meaningful damage out she exposes herself even more. \n\nI think the utility on these spells could also use a buff. Landing a Noxious Blast grants a 20% movement speed increase for 3 seconds. It is hardly a factor at all, it's such a minor buff for such a short duration that it hardly enables her to kite or chase people down. Her Miasma slows for 25-45% for 2 seconds, again hardly a factor in her ability to peel for herself or slow enemies down. The slow duration is just too short for such a minor slow. Just consider this slow in comparison to other champion's, for example Lulu's glitterlance or Miss Fortune's Make it Rain, or whatever other slow you want to compare it to. Most other slows in the game are either substantial in slow with short duration or substantial in duration with lower speed reduction, Cassiopeia's Miasma is neither or those. If I'm completely honest, both her Noxious Blast and Miasma are utter garbage both in terms of the damage and utility they bring. They only serve to facilitate her usage of Twin Fang which is just a horrible design.\n\nHer ultimate could also use some tweaks. It feels really clunky and unresponsive. I think the cast time is nice for animation canceling the wind-up with flash, but ultimately it's kind of unnecessary. It seems like it has a cast time with a very long animation which delays it more than most champions ultimates. I cannot even count the number of times I've been instantly blown up (full 100-0) while trying to get this ultimate off, I just don't think the long wind up and cast time are necessary. In addition, her ult's base damage is incredibly low with very low ratio's not to mention how gimmicky it is. Her rank 1 ultimate does 150 base damage with a .5 ratio. Compare that to let's say Syndra's rank 1 ultimate which does 270 minimum base damage (+ 90 damage per sphere) at a .6 ratio. I just think her ult needs some major quality of life changes and touch-ups.\n\nFinally her passive is just so counter-intuitive to the direction the game has been heading since season 2. 500 stacks of Aspect of the Serpent is actually extremely difficult to achieve and for most people it probably won't come online until 35 minutes at the earliest but most likely 40+ minutes into the game. This just seems so delayed, especially for a meta that see's most gametimes average 27-29 minutes (at least at pro play) and especially considering her ratio's are balanced around 500 stacks. If you were to not poison a single enemy the entire game it would take 50 minutes to reach 500 stacks. I know this isn't practical considering you will absolutely land poison's some of the time, but consider that your Miasma and Noxious Blast only last 2 and 3 seconds, they really don't accelerate your stacks that much unless you are consistently landing your poison which you may not always be able to do. Also consider that poisoning multiple players does not accelerate the rate at which you gain stacks. You can land Noxious Blast on 5 enemies at once, but you will only gain 3 stacks of Aspect of the Serpent. 500 stacks is just way too many, 400 would probably be much more appropriate given that the length of games is going down and that other threshold for stacks are 100 and 250. 500 stacks makes it a huge gap between 250 and 500. This is particularly troublesome because this is generally long after laning phase and the ability to consistently generate stacks from enemies is extremely diminished. It makes jumping from the second (250) threshold to the third and final (500) stack threshold so difficult.\n\nThe passive 25% CDR seems completely out of place. Not only because it gives an odd amount of CDR that you're required to take at least 5% from runes to round it off (not that you would want to), but also the fact that CDR is a relatively weak stat on cassiopeia. Her Noxious Blast is a base 4 second cooldown at all ranks and her Twin Fang is a base 5 second cooldown at all ranks, not to mention it resets on poisoned targets. So really the 25% CDR only facilitates her ultimate which does have an absurdly long CD relative to it's power and her Miasma which as we have highlighted is pretty much a non-factor in her kit. I feel like you could just replace the CDR with another stat such as spell pen or spell vamp and she would actually see a lot more use out of it. The 25% CDR feels very out of place on a champion who has very low base cooldowns and her damage frontloaded on a spell that resets. \n\nI think the Cassiopeia rework was really cool and looked exciting on paper, but it just absolutely does not translate to realistic gameplay. She has way too many fundamental flaws with her kit and lacks the power to make up for these massive flaws. Yes, she can be one of the highest damage mages in the game, but if she instantly gets blown up 100-0 or can't get in range or can't consistently deal damage, it's just not practical. Cassiopeia needs to be balanced around what she can realistically do not the utmost extreme potential that she very often never reaches.\n\n\n> [{quoted}](name=RiotRepertoir,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=1IUQUyxT,comment-id=000c0000000000000000,timestamp=2016-01-19T00:11:15.976+0000)\n>\n> That sounds like something that new tech would need to be created for, so it doesn't seem like a quick easy thing at the moment, unless there's an internal workaround that could do it that I'm spacing on.\n> \n> I'm not really one to field buff requests, sorry.

This forced thematic of Cassiopeia gaining things is only there so she can somewhat function as an AD carry-esque mage yet her kit does not truly work. Only time it did was when she was blatantly overtuned.\n\nInstead, Cassiopeia's enemies need to lose things when she interacts with them. They should lose HP of course. They could also lose other stuff. She's supposed to be a poisoner. Make her one. Make her spread her curse. Allow her to deteriorate everything she touches. And because she's an opportunist, when she's done weakening her targets, she will strike, slithering in close range and sinking her fangs into her enemies. When I play Cass, I wanna play a game of cat and mouse, making sure to endanger myself as little as possible until I'm ready to strike and if I can't manage to ensure my own safety until I'm ready to commit myself to a kill, I should be punished.

It's a simple harass tool and her key farming skill, so yes, it'd feel great for it to feel like it did real damage. But I don't think that's the core issue I have with her atm.\n\nAs for \"debilitation\" I don't know what other players think about when they say the word in regards to her.

Even to this day, I still believe that rylai's liandri's was her best build (for old cass at least).\n\nBut what was really important to me was the \"melting\" aspect. Cass never had \"burst\" in the same way other mages and assassins had it. Sure, she had great dps if she got her stun off on someone diving her, but that's more of a defense mechanism rather than her primary combo. No, when I say \"melting\" I mean watching their hp bar just drain away with no discernable \"chunks\" appearing as it dropped. It always felt so satisfying watching any champ, no matter how tanky they were just steadily lose their hp bar at similar rates. (I still remember playing against a fed mundo 2-3 yrs ago and just watching his life bar drop rapidly as I kited him thru my Q's and W's)\n\nSo when the rework hit, I was left with some kind of ap marksman that used spells instead of aa's when I previously had a siege queen that could kite the enemy for days.\n\nAh yes, I almost forgot one of the most important features (again, to me) of old cass. Her sieging prowess. She could not only defend towers alone, but also seige enemy towers for days.

The thing about poisons is that they won't outright kill you swiftly (that's why I think burst on Cassiopeia is completely stupid) but they will just make your life *hell* to the point where you can't take it anymore and your body just gives way. I've always thought their could be something more added to her poisons to make it feel like they're doing more then reducing her opponents health points, maybe causing them to do less damage, causing them to be feared if they stay in the miasma to long (if you're trapped in a life threatening poison slowly chewing away at your life wouldn't you be terrified) or something along those lines - This is what poison should do. If a snake bit me and its venom/poison w.e makes its way through my veins I should be getting weaker and weaker to the point where I just die, there are LOADS of potential to make something similar like this to Cassiopeia with a full relaunch. The reason why Cassiopeia was my favorite champion in the game until the rework because it was just so satisfying spreading your poisons are watching everyone's health bars slowly drip away and then going in for that last hit like the opportunistic snake you are (Most snakes will bite their pray and completely wait for them to either die or be near it to finish them off and go for the prize). One thing poisons shouldn't do is **buff Cassiopeia** which is why I think that passive is a pitiful joke. \n\nI'll be frank, I think a majority of everyone else at Riot is a clown and should be told they are (Stashu ...) but Riot Rep your replies give me faith that Cassiopeia will be returned to her former glory or at the very least made somewhat playable again.

However, I just had an idea... a truly insidious one.\n\n_________________________________\n\n**Cooldown Increasing** poisons. As in, when a target is poisoned, their abilities (not **Summoner Spells** and probably not **Item Actives** or **Passives**) take longer to recharge. You should be fearful of being poisoned, and being poisoned should actually increase your danger. Armor/MR shredding affects Tanks much more than a Carry, and if the poison lowered Damage Output that would put her into a more anti-carry role. Cassiopeia should still want to poison -_**everyone**_-.\n\nActually, I at first envisioned a **-Healing** and **-Mana Regen** effect, but I feel the **-CDR** would be better balance wise (cause not everyone even uses mana, or their mana usage hangs more precariously than the Sword of Damacles). A snake and/or poisoner weakens their target before actually beating them. By increasing her enemies' cooldowns (I'd say never more than 10-12%, maybe a scaling based on the abilities' original CD??), they will heal less, bolster their defenses less, save their allies less, cast less and so on. They would become wary standing near the snake, as anyone should.\n\nThis would shift her from Ryze 0.5; a machine gun Mage that has poor split push and little relative safety. She would approach what probably fits closer to the poison/snake Mage people think of when they see her for the first time (and want her returned to :3 ).\n\nCaveats and additions:\n\n* The CDI (Cooldown Increasing) shouldn't be a constant thing. Something akin to Yasuo's dash timer or Udyr's Stun per target should be applied to this. This not only gives both players the proverbial \"window of engagement/decision making\" that Riot oh-so loves, but it creates another lever for the Live Balance team to tune and fiddle with. \n\n\n* This should probably not be affected by Tenacity, though I can see the reason and arguments for why it in turn should be.\n\n\n* There is also the option of adding in an Attack Speed Debuff so non-caster ADC's have something to worry about.\n\n\n* Cass's current passive just seems to be bad design. A Snake doesn't grow stronger because it's poisoned people, and in general, it doesn't seem Poison Magey to grow in power for having poisoned someone for a second 20 minutes ago.\n\n\n* Abilities that make charges (and Karma's R) should get a weaker application of the +CDI. In almost all cases, these abilities are not only the 'bread and butter' for the champion, but are entirely balanced on the idea that they'll get multiple uses in quick succession in an engagement. Mostly, I'm just worried about Heimer turrets and Vi E's (and my Teemo shrooms!). Karma would/should get this too as her R is so crucial to her relative effectiveness.\n\n________________________\n\nAnother idea I had as I was typing all that is to make a percent of her poison deal True Damage or Percent (Max/Current/Missing) Health, and the chance to increase that % with continued stacks or Ability combos. This still instills that her poisons are dangerous, but it does relegate her poison to the DAMAGE DAMAGE DAMAGE she does now and her old Lane Bully style of play. It's the easier and less intuitive path.\n\nAnd, as much as I adore Life Steal and Spell Vamp, HP Siphoning, and on-hit Healing**^** (except Xin Zhao, no one should heal off attacking Towers!), it doesn't feel normal that Twin Fangs heals Cass. I totally let it slide though, because she does need a tool to let her survive in her short dueling range.\n\n\n**^**Seriously, I freaking love having your survivablity based around how aggressive you are or how unfocused the enemy attack you (HP Regen).

She has her strong lv. 2 powerspike, but she often has a hard time after that. \n\nThat said, I agree that her ways to apply poison are too similar (ground-targeted skillshots) and that her E holds too much weight both in her gameplay and her kit (while being the least charachterizing spell). In my mind a solution would be to reverse the situation and going from \"Poison enables Twin Fangs\" to \"Twin Fangs enables Poison\". This means that her two poison abilities should apply a debilitating effect + DoT damage and her E should enhance them as if it was ripping through the weakened flesh of her poisoned enemies and worsening their conditions, allowing the poison to spread even more. \n\nIdeas for debilitating effects are: \n\n1) *Slow*. Poison often implies reduced mobility up to complete paralysis. Her poison might apply a slow (perhaps also to attack speed) that, enhanced by E, would end up rooting+disarming the enemy. \n\n2) *Shred* . Poison often implies vulnerability. Her poison might apply a MagicRes shred + stackable (%missing health) DoT that, enhanced by E, would bring the dps of her poisoning abilities to secure death for her opponents (unless they have a QSS/Zhoonya).\n\n3) *Confusion* . Poison often clouds judgement and vision. Her poison might apply vision restriction with the vision field getting more narrow as you get stacks of poison with E (this doens't seem very funny on the receiving end, but I'm just throwing off ideas). Reaching a certain cap, you get *charmed* by Cassio.\n\nThe idea of a Charm in Cassiopeia's kit feels very compelling to me, especially since her old VO went so hard on the venomous seductress vibe. It would also combo with her R since you would have a reliable way to apply the stun of Petrifying Gaze (balanced by the fact that you would have to hit your poisons and apply a certain number of stacks - I imagine 4 would be cool - thus giving 2/2.5 secs to your opponent for reaction).","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Quepha","date":"2016-01-18T23:58:02.525+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RiotRepertoir,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=1IUQUyxT,comment-id=000c,timestamp=2016-01-18T23:14:49.122+0000)\n>\n> What does \"debilitation\" mean to you?

She has been neglected for years now and the one time she receives a champion update it turns out to be the worst of its kind, what a colossal slap in the face to any Cass veteran out there. \n\nTo make matters worse, they didn't even care to do a followup, neither did they consider any feedback from her actual playerbase. Instead they forced this abomination through along with a kit and playstyle that's too binary and leaves no room for diversity or improvement since it would apparently break the champion. \n\nThey never once addressed her actual issues (lack of range, immobility, squishyness, awful ultimate *and* nonexistent AOE damage since the rework), instead they only increased the focus on those weaknesses and made them as blatant as ever. Right now there isn't a single matchup she could reliably win, **even her lategame is vastly overrated and never exceeds a 50% winrate.** Is this what we're supposed to put up with as a supposed \"hypercarry\"? \n\n**And that is if you even make it to the lategame**, games tend to end a lot earlier nowadays due to the crazy snowballing mechanics introduced by the season 6 changes. **Her current powercurve is set between 35% and 44% during early to midgame**, that's already a massive handicap and just to receive **a mere 50% winrate after all the shit you have to put up with** is no sufficient reason for ever playing this champion if you can pick up any of the dominating early game champs and still remain above a 50% winrate throughout the game.\n\n**I also tried contacting some of the developers at Riot via Twitter** like some other Cassmains on here since they never respond to any of these threads and they didn't even care to reply. **After confronting them with statistics and more arguments they simply proceeded to block me.** This is exactly how Riot treats feedback and criticism concerning issues that make them look bad, they simply ignore them - how incredibly unprofessional. \n\nI seriously ask myself who they're making this game for if they don't even listen to dedicated mains and longtime players anymore, all they care about nowdays is on how to fill their pockets with the latest broken champion release. **Yes, I know that they're going to work on a mage update later this year but that'll take them at least SIX MORE MONTHS until that moment has come, are we supposed to wait an entire year since the day she received her last set of nerfs?** \n\nThey don't even acknowledge her existence when it comes to skins **(1074 days since Jade Fang Cass came out)**, lore or anything else anymore, she simply doesn't fit into their perfect little world. I swear, there has to be an unwritten policy we don't know about that prohibits them from talking about Cass at all.\n\n[Even Meddler doesn't want to talk anymore, despite him contemplating some changes on her balancing before.](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/e7yzgea0-meddler-about-some-of-the-things-you-said-2-months-ago) Cassmains right now are in a far worse place than Mordekaiser's playerbase ever was, at least their situation is being taken seriously.\n\nShe really deserves a relaunch at this point, there's no other way to make up for this atrocious treatment. She's pretty much the Urgot of midlane, no joke - and she might become the next Yorick if this negligence keeps up.","replies":[]}]}
