Tantrum can be used every 3 seconds or so, cull the meek can do significantly MORE base damage (and doesn't have a resource cost at all) and heals, and decimate does MORE base damage (210) while being capable of doing a max 315. From what you mentioned, most of those abilites are actually stronger and if they were to be switched on Lee's build for Cripple, it would be considered broken. \n\nSona's shield only gives 155, but its an aura so it effects multiple allies AND has a heal to go along with it. On top of that, it scales with AP which means sona will actually be able to make use of it. Lee isn't building any AP so the devs KNOW that it has to have a decent base stat. The same can be said for moves like Panth's ult. \n\nAnd as for the single target thing: yes if it hits all 5 people it does a lot of damage. But thats how AoE works. Youre never going to hit all 5 people when playing against a good team. And if you do manage to do it, its not about you being good; its about them being bad. Amumu's ult has a base damage of 350 and is guaranteed to hit multiple opponents AND has a 2 second stun. Graves has a similar pattern to lee's ult kick, has a base damage of 440 to those behind him (even more to the first target), has a wider hit box (will hit more people) AND is easier to hit because of his range! On top of that it scales better! Its an ult man, I don't know what you want me to tell you. Its powerful. You also have to be right up next to the person to do it and its difficult to land multiple hits. If it weren't powerful it wouldn't be an ult, but its not anywhere near OP. Many other ults have similar damages.","replies":[{"poster":"macromite","date":"2015-01-17T07:00:37.641+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":2,"body":"I think you forgot some things, namely the multiple uses of his abilities\n\nhis cripple is strong because it has good damage, and also a pretty good slow, which means to make the damage calculations correct you need to add in the extra aa or two he would get from the slow, which on a mainly ad champion adds quite a bit. cull the meek isn't always better, and using the higher damage version does have a cost, a very big one at that, half of the fury renek has, which means that odds are, in a fight renek won't be using the bigger cull the meek every time, but lee will be able to have his cripple. another thing is that ki burst does ad damage, and while yes, you would not get the penetration, you also get to know that your build will do mixed damage, which is great early on.\n\nyo uare forgetting something, lee sin has a sustain coming out of his shield as well, a huge chunk of life steal and spell vamp pops out of it along with his big shield, and a good reason why sona would have better utility spell than lee sin, because that is pretty much the point of a support, the problem that I see with your point here, is that these abilities can even be compared at all, lee sin should not have so much utility for an early game high damage bruiser. and when you say that it has to have good base stats, I'm just gonna laugh at you, because the reason for it should be the sustain or the\njump, it it gives broken sustain, a decent shield, and a quick dash. there are full champions with less loaded kits than lee sins w.\n\nOne final note, you can not seriously believe that it is hard in any way for lee to hit more than one person with his ultimate. if he jumps to the back of a team with his crazy mobility, he can kick their backliners into the middle of his frontliners really easily and on the way, odds are it will hit multiple people because of how that works. why lee sins ult is op is not only because of the damage either, its because you can do very little against it. its a knockback so you cant clear it with any form a cc removal, it does good damage, and it can't miss. you mentioned graves for his ult, graves ult has similar damage, but it does not have cc, and his ult is a skill shot.\n\nyo uwant to know one more thing, its thoughts like yours that are why the right champions don't get nerfed, people who play an op champion will fight for them, because in their own minds they have come up with ways to deal with them, but the truth of the matter is that most of the ways that you think lee is not op, are only true if he only had some of the things listed. if lee had access to his crazy mobility w but not his stupid undodgeable cc ult, he would not be op. if he didnt have so much early dominance and late game safety, he would not be op. do you really want to know the reason why lee sin is op? its because he has good enough ad scaling to not really fall off too hard late game, and he has enough utility to where when he does get his crap kicked early, ha can still come back and be a nuisance late game.","replies":[{"poster":"Dengeden","date":"2015-01-17T16:48:21.086+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":7,"body":"Ok no, and no. \"Crazy mobility\"?
