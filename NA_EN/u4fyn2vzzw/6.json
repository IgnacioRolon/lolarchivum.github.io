I was plat 3 a few months ago random match maker shit on me for 3 weeks straight went like 37 losses in 40 games drop straight to gold 5, back up back down, gold 1 last week gold 5 today, I PLAY ALOT. All that matters is when you \"stop\" playing.  I can play 4000 matches be diamond 5, and then go on a 50 game losing streak and drop to gold 5 yet have played 4050 matches matches at that point and been diamond 5 for 4000 of them 4050 matches. the following week go on a 50 game win streak shoot up diamond 5 again. Yet if i stopped the week before i was gold 5.\n\nAgain rank means nothing unless you are d1 or bronze everything in between is a huge crap shoot i played vs silver who play better than diamonds i played with diamonds who play worse than a silver. system has too much luck and easy ways to manipulate the rankings. I'll give you perfect example, my friend account was diamond 4 oh i forgot to mention that he doesnt play much so his buddy who is a diamond player uses it \"mostly\" but everyone one in a while my friend who placed  each season in high bronze jumps on to shit the bed for a few matches in diamond and in between then the diamon guy jumps on to play a few, he mostly plays after the rank has dropped though because he likes to get shorter que times and stomp his lane opponent.\n\nTHIS IS VERY COMMON NOT RARE and is just one of many exploits that makes the rank system meaningless.","replies":[{"poster":"Troll for Trump","date":"2015-07-27T19:00:36.425+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Then there is the beginning of the season...\nSo most games you lose arent much.

Janna F kennedy (one of the best 2500 or 2000 players on the server, Master tier and challenger at one point IIRC) once told me back in season 2 something like this, its not verbatim, but its close:\n\n\"When you play league, you will automatically lose about 40% of your games due to an enemy player getting fed, a teammate feeding, a teammate throwing, and afk, or other circumstances over which you have no control. Likewise and conversely, you will also automatically win about 40% of your matches for the same reasons, a teammate gets fed, enemy has an afk or throws, etc. The key to your destiny lies in how you approach and perform in the 20% of matches over which you can have a direct impact in the result.\"\n\nI have rarely heard anything truer when it comes to league. What it boils down to is: are you gonna shine in those 20%? Will you do everything in your power to make those wins? And since you never know til the game ends which one of these percentages it applies to, will you play hard EVERY time assuming THIS game is one of the 20% you can affect?","replies":[{"poster":"RP Tzuyu","date":"2015-07-27T22:40:24.131+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"THIS GUY also NEEDS A TROPHY,","replies":[{"poster":"jaymc1130","date":"2015-07-27T22:45:59.268+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Qnaug,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=EhvYR1Pd,comment-id=00010000000200000001,timestamp=2015-07-27T22:40:24.131+0000)\n>\n> THIS GUY also NEEDS A TROPHY,\n\nI gladly accept!

Someone suggested being promoted at 140LP  which is roughly the same as winning 0-100 LP then 2 games after that assuming you gain 20 LP each, which would almost resemble the 2/3 promotion series. \n\nThe thing I like more though is, once you hit for example 97 LP, you don't need to win a game after and miss out on like 25 LP that you'd gain from that win, considering it would only take the 3 lp you need to qualify you for a series. So if you were at 97 and got 25 for a win, you'd be at 122, instead of being at 100, losing 23 Leftover LP and being awarded a series that would make you win 2 games, which would in total probably put you around 160 LP anyways which is a higher risk of not making promotion because if the 140 LP promo system were in place, you would've been promoted after the first win (122 LP + 18 LP win =promo). \n\nThis seems really confusing now that I'm reading it, so I'll type it in a math-y way?\n\nHow it is now : \nYou're at 97 LP for example. Win a game, +23 LP. It would only take 3/23 to give you 100 for your series, wasting the rest. Then your 2 promo wins WOULD have given about 25 each if thats what you average, which would cause you to have to gain about 170 LP total because of the 20 you lost for going from 97-100, then 25 each promo win. \n\nPromotion at 140:\nYou're at 97 LP, you win a game and you're at 120 instead of flat out getting a series. Now all you have to do is gain 20 more LP, and you're promoted. That should be ONE game assuming you win it. With the system we have now, that would have to be TWO wins.\nThe promotion at 140 way basically just eliminates the possibility of wasting a lot of LP and having to win more games than you should for promotion, making it much harder and putting far more pressure on you to win a series since it can so easily be lost. \n\nI really am sorry if its confusing, it was surprisingly hard to attempt to explain it. Everyone has been there though, at like 98 or 99 LP, knowing that you have to win a game for like one or two LP, its such a frustration and waste to put in that effort for like 2 LP. \n\nI still think going from for example Gold 1 - Plat 5 should be either promoted at 180 or remain a best of 5.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SteelStallion","date":"2015-07-28T06:04:51.091+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"This just seems like a thread for people to present anecdotal evidence and complain about their individual experiences.
