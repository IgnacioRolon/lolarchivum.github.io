She is so punishing because she excels at taking advantage of peoples mistakes.  Usually most people who pick Vayne know how to play her once she has 3-5 items, the problem is just getting to that point.  If she is kept down, she can usually AFK farm because a lot of people who get fed get overconfident and start tunneling on kills instead of objectives such as towers.  She us usually then able to make up the deficit she had from the overaggression of your fed teammates and get on par or further ahead of her counterpart ADC, meaning she can fight now.  Also she is one of the few ADC's that's more rewarding for how skilled you are at playing her compared to most ADC's, so a lot of people play her.\n\nAnother of her strengths is that a lot of the traditional ADC's who could dump on her hard early in the game got nerfed as well as the ones who could outscale her.
