For example, you call Renekton a bruiser and Shen a tank, yet they both have only 1 CC ability, and Renekton gains WAY more bonus health from his ult than Shen does from his shield.  Also, you say that Bruisers are the ones who split push, yet one of Shen's main strengths is his split pushing. \n\nI think the general difference between Tanks and Bruisers is that a Tank is a champ who has strong tools to engage a fight, and has natural tanky parts of their kit - bonus resists/ shields/ health/ dmg reduction.  They often have built in sustain, and % damage built in their kits to allow them to have high enough base damage to be relevant.  A bruiser is simply a champ that benefits from building a mixture of damage and tank items; bruiser champs range from an AD melee champ like Garen, to an AP mage like Swain who generally builds tanky (RoA/ Hourglass/ Liandry's/ Spirit Visage).","replies":[{"poster":"Done25","date":"2015-01-24T04:18:51.347+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=PatMcGroyn,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=uoOKmm1h,comment-id=00000001000000000000,timestamp=2014-12-28T23:40:35.304+0000)\n>\n> I find the distinction a bit forced, though.

Best used in 1v1 fights. **Tends** to prefer AD due to the nature of auto attacks being a large source of their damage. Akali, Fizz, Shaco, Lee Sin, Master Yi, Renekton, Vi, Mundo, J4, Trundle, Fiora, Nocturne.\n\nTanks - AoE damage. Best used in group fights. **Tends** to prefer AP due to being ability based. Cho'Gath, Sejuani, Rammus, Malphite (Only because of the AoE on Brutal Strikes), Amumu, Zac, Singed.\n\nGive me a champion and I will tell you Fighter or Tank and WHY.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"PatMcGroyn","date":"2014-12-27T01:55:38.464+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=TehNACHO,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=uoOKmm1h,comment-id=000000010000,timestamp=2014-12-25T23:03:48.037+0000)\n>\n> Ding ding ding, another winner.\n> \n> Bonus question: What difference does it make, in the context of this thread, that Renekton is not a tank, but a bruiser?\n\nHaha.
