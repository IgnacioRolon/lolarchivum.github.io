When you get bitten by a fucking snake and its venom is streaming down your veins you're NOT WORRYING ABOUT IF THE SNAKE IS GETTING STRONGER FROM BITING YOU, YOU'RE WORRYING HOW LONG YOU HAVE TO LIVE AND WHAT YOU CAN DO TO STOP IT {All dot's in the game feel like that}. I'll even go as far to say pretend you're a snake and you're hunting for prey, when you bite your target and they scurry off are you wondering how strong you're going to get from biting them and how long will it take in order to hunt them down later or how long it's going to take for them to finally get weak enough for you to kill them and enjoy a meal (Pre-Rework Cassiopeia).","replies":[{"poster":"xJLx MCHammer","date":"2014-11-30T03:26:48.015+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":5,"body":"I see Cass as she is.

Her E was the main dps tool with the most potential. It's only when Champs like LB, Zed..etc were released and become popular that Cass went from being a hard lane bully to semi bully who lost lane to real bullies like Zed. That's when the Guides changed to explain to players that although E did more overall dmg, Q was more safer and in line with meta where she can poke her opponents down\nIn reality, if you do the math, maxing E did more dmg than Q","replies":[{"poster":"Serpents Embrace","date":"2014-11-30T21:37:27.879+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Maxing Q and E is conditional, and it always was before the rework.\n\nE gave you greater DPS, but Q gave you better poke and survivability (through kiting).\n\nTHe problem with the rework now is that you utterly lack choices.

You should never ever be buying CDR items on Cassio....I'm surprised somebody with the name \"Serpents Embrace\" would even consider doing that. CDR has always scaled extremely poorly with Cassiopeia. Right now the CDR on the passive only provides the benefit of reducing her Q back to 3 seconds (I really don't think Q should have had its cooldown raised in the first place), and allowing her to throw out more Ws and ultimates. It also makes Twin Fang slightly less punishing to miss. However, anything above 25% is largely wasted. A well played Cassio shouldn't require any CDR at all. \n\nHer itemization has been far from homogenized. While you are 99% of the time required to build a Tear or RoA, the rest of her item choices are largely the same as they were pre-rework. The only item that is no longer considering is Liandry's and, in my opinion, it was always a sub-optimal buy on Cass. \n \n> Stashu took a flexible champion and made her rigid. It doesn't help that the passive change not only screwed her mana, it shackled her with an unfun stacking mini game.\n\nOn live, her skill order is rigid, I agree with you there. Right now if you max Q you are going to be extremely weak until you get those points in E. However, as I stated above, the amplification should allow her to use Q as a waveclear/poke ability again. If she wants to poke she really only needs to get one or two Twin Fangs off and that should be possible against everybody not named Xerath.","replies":[{"poster":"Serpents Embrace","date":"2014-11-30T23:03:27.163+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":4,"body":"TT first item core on Cassio was Morellonomicon, as it was on most mages.

You are wasting so much gold on the CDR and mana regen (which Cass also doesn't care for that much. 2 Doran's Rings allowed her to regen the mana it took to cast a Q at max DC stacks in the 5 seconds you have before you must cast a spell again).

Her Q is and always has been just a tool to enable her Twin Fang spam in fights and to help her kite. Sure, in lane if you maxed Q then it would be your primary source of damage through poke, but as soon as the game extended beyond that if you relied on Q as your main source of damage you were playing Cass wrong. You could get away with staying on the outskirts of a fight throwing out a Q if you REALLY had to avoid going in (they still had important spells up that could kill you), but almost 90% of the time you WOULD be in range for Twin Fang burn somebody. Not being able to do so is akin to not being able to autoattack as an AD carry in a fight.
