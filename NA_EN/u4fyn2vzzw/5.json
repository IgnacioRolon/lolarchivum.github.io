About your question, I'd define utility as \"everything that isn't about directly making hp bars go up or down faster or slower\". That means everything accept Damage, Heals and Shield and damage amplification (And posssibly damage buff). I guess you could argue about a gapcloser... But that's irevelent for now.\n\nAnyway, what I meant is that Q/powerQ and W  are basically straight skills. powerW I'm not sure, it's not damage/heal, but It's straight defense (or damage reduction in this case). Mostly non intereactive and unidimentionnal. I'm not sure.\nE and R are a ms buff and soft-CC and a CC. They have no other uses (other than damage). All those, I'd call utility. \nYou mention I'm understating what her skills do, but now that I've explained myself, do I still understate what they do?\n\nAbout the \"soft vs hard\" utility. It was me improvising words. I was drawing a parrallel between a soft CC  and hard CC. A soft CC is one that leaves some possibilities to the opponent while a hard just completely nullifies teh opponent. The same way, a soft utility would be one that doesn't completely changes the game (ms buff, the smallish wall of thresh's ult) while a hard utility would be one that radically changes the playing field (walls, dashes, grabs, complete zone control (like Azir's ult or tower)).\nI'll admit I made this distinction on the spot, I know it's totally unofficial.\n\nadded : In leona's case, I considered her very long range ult as \"utility\" since she can do it from really far outside the fight basically making pseudo-global range a form of utility.

AP casters (Annie, Karma, Zyra, Nami, Janna, Lulu, Vel'Koz, Morgana, Soraka, and even Zilean despite the fact nobody plays him anymore anyways), and the rest (Alistar, Blitzcrank, Leona, Thresh, Braum, and Taric). I've excluded niche supports for obvious reasons.\n\nIn comparison to ALL other supports:\nOnly Zyra has lower base HP\nSona is tied with 4 other supports with 325 (The lowest possible) base movement speed\nShe also has THE weakest heal, base and scaling.\nThe second weakest shield, base and scaling. Only Thresh's is lower base, but that is still an AoE shield, infinitely scaling, with the teammate saving component as well.\nThe LOWEST amount of CC pre level 6. This might be debatable compared to Zilean, but he doesn't require using another part of his kit like Sona does to actually utilize the CC. I'm referring to her passive. \nOnly Annie, Zyra, Vel'Koz, Morgana have lower mobility in terms of skills, and those flaws are supplemented in their insane amounts of CC and AP ratios. There's a reason why you don't see AP Sona mid anymore.\n\nCompared to AP casters: \nThe weakest AP ratios across the board. P 20%, Q 50%/20% for on hit Aura effect, W 20% Heal, 30% max heal, 20% Shield, R 50%. There are some more % per AP ratios on her W and E but those are still rather laughable, considering Sona shouldn't build AP anyways with her other trashy ratios. \n\nCompared to the rest:\nYeah try poking these f'ers out of lane. Getting caught by one ability from any of them is almost guaranteed death, and considering her HP and Move speed, getting caught is actually REALLY easy.\n\nTo those of you who say that her win rate is still high: Yeah I've actually got nothing. I don't know why her win rate is high. Maybe us Sona mains are just smarter than the rest of you. But that's not true, because we still play her. \n\nKidding on that last part, but I'm a Sona main. Or at least I was. I haven't played her since this last set of nerfs, which mark the ninth straight set of nerfs for the champion without meaningful buffs. I'm still a sucker for punishment and will be getting this skin, but I won't play her in ranked until she gets some serious changes. \n\nRiot has decided to nerf her strengths in her AP ratios and AoE healing.  Having a healing ability that only gets strong when a teammate is dangerously close to death, with a maximum cool down of 6 seconds (W CDR is 10 at all ranks, 6 seconds assumes 40% CDR) is a joke. You literally have to wait until the fight is almost over, compared to Soraka who can literally heal an ADC to 100% 3 times over in the span it takes Sona to to it once, if that.\n\n\nHer ability CDs are too high for what little effect they have. The only redeeming quality in her kit is her passive. And by that I mean Power Chord W. At base, it is literally half an exhaust. \n\nTl;dr Read the above paragraph. Sona's in a really bad place right now. I used to consider myself a Sona main. I used to play her AP mid, AP support, Utility support, and even tried her as ADC a couple times. All to much success. With her trash AP ratios, punishing CDR, GARBAGE base stats, and overall mediocre state, I haven't been able to touch her in ranked play. I'm a sucker for punishment and will still get this skin, but I don't accept this 'shiny!' ultimate skin to change how I feel about her.\n\nedit: actual very little basis WTF ENGLISH?","replies":[{"poster":"U4fyn2vZzW","date":"2015-02-04T03:30:25.973+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"This .

While this damage is less \nthan what she had before, it's still significant and to prove that she has around a 64% win-rate when she builds Lich Bane. Despite all of this she still has a weak \nheal, very little CC pre-6, and is incredibly squishy. She also gets outclassed by {{champion:40}}, {{champion:143}}, {{champion:267}},   and {{champion:25}} as a support/mage.\n\nBTW Riot nice job on the skin but too bad Sona's not in an optimal spot thanks to the balance team.","replies":[]},{"poster":"2 much sauuuce","date":"2015-02-03T21:17:37.856+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"She's not totally nerfed into oblivion.

She is picked ALOT. Specifcally in low elo. \n\nWhy? Because scrubs dont know how squishy she is. They take one power cord, and tink \"Oh shit wtf that damage so op\", and then run away and let her do whatever she wants.\n\nIn high elo, Sona is a worse version of Nami, with slightly better teamfights IF she doesnt get nuked from offhand aoe. This is also only true if Sona builds a stupid amount of AP for a supp. You cant build utility on Sona. You NEED AP.\n\nWhy does she need AP? She is worse than literally every other supp in the game if she does not build around 250+ AP. Specifcally nami can do literally everything she does better, aside from damage reduction. This means very limited choice in utility items.\n\nThe only utility items I would recommend are Banner, Ardent, and MAYBE Frostqueen. The only one I get regularly is Ardents, and that is because usually I have multiple targets who benefit from AS. Banner is only good if the enemy has aoe magic damage, or a fed katarina. You can pray banner stops her from penta'ing your team. It also gives you some good splitpush, so keep that in mind. Frostqueen is self explanatory. If a slow will actually be meaningful, buy it. If not, scrap frostfang as soon as you dont need it anymore.\n\nYou can only take 2 at the most to remain relevent/do anything that Nami couldnt do better. Ardent will usually be your best bet, and going full AP after words is kinda mandatory. \n\nYour gonna NEED sightstone, Lich-bane, and mobi-boots. Everything else you buy NEEDS to have AP in some form. You also need cdr.","replies":[]},{"poster":"A Fiery Rundas","date":"2015-02-03T20:16:19.791+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"Pick up the phone\n\n\nCause I fucking called it","replies":[]},{"poster":"Superdum","date":"2015-02-04T02:33:01.291+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":11,"body":"She needed those nerfs, people who actually played against sona knew she had a lot of damage.
