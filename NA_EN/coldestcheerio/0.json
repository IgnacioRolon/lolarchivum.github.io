I patched in the client and everything but when I go to create the account, I can't! It takes me to the Public Beta Environment page and when I click \"PBE Status\" to create the account, it just keeps resetting to the main PBE page. Any help or anyone else having this issue? I am eager to start testing but I can't create the account! Help please!!!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-08T17:00:17.667+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like something is keeping you in a cycle, but some browser troubleshooting should fix it up.  Try clearing your [cache ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752694-Clearing-Browser-History-and-Cookies)for a resolution, but you can also try  another browser or Incognito mode in case an extension is getting in the way.  Hopefully, that ill do the trick!","replies":[{"poster":"ColdestCheerio","date":"2016-11-09T18:30:22.214+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I went incognito and it worked for me!

When I go to the PBE signup page (same place the Create Account link in the email takes me), I do not see the login bar at the top of the screen. Is the website bugged due to the new top-bar layout on the League home page?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-08T18:53:30.699+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the info here!

It is still bugged in the same way. I hate to damn myself out of receiving a PBE account because I've been reformed for a long while now, but this account was permanently banned about a year ago...
