About a month ago I was perma-banned for dishonorable behavior, I didn’t dispute it, because I unfortunately knew what I did and there was no one to blame, but myself. So like most people, I started over with a new account to start fresh as well as learn to be a better teammate all around. I used to find myself running to the chat as soon as team mates or opponents start trash talking because it would immediately go to my head and it would just become a flame war. But anyways, I’ve learned to collect myself, to just stop and think before saying anything, like is it worth it? Or “maybe I am doing bad?” And I’ve become a friendlier teammate, I try not give anyone issues in the chat, so I can help try and make the rift a better place. But so one day after chatting with a new friend I met in the game, they said to me “You’re pretty good, nice too, is this your first account?” And then I told them the story and they were taken back saying “WHAT?! That’s crazy! I can’t believe you were toxic.” And I responded with the “haha, unfortunately I was and my account’s gone because of it” and then we started talking more and they mentioned if I tried appealing to Riot Support to get my account back. And I thought it’d probably be a little pointless because I’ve never heard of Riot unbanning a player for proving to be reformed. Only heard of people being unbanned under a mistake that wasn’t really their fault, like with card information being thought of as faulty, stuff like that. But anyways, so I came into contact with an Agent named Chocobro, and they said ‘Unfortunately there currently isn’t a program or anything of the sort to where you could prove honorable again through a second account or anything like that.’ Which I understand, because I’m sure that’s not at Riot’s list of priorities of things they want to add/change to the game. And dishonorable players can be a touchy subject, because you could look back at what they did and be like “idk, that’s pretty toxic, I wouldn’t want that in anyone else’s games.” Or just think it’s undeserving for a ban lift because “they’ve breached the summoner’s code. They gave up their right to that account once they did what they did.” Which I understand as well, it’s mainly just a little upsetting because I’ve had that account for almost 5 years been playing since mid season 5, I had a lot of hours on there, skins and things I spent money on, as well as just memories with friends who’ve come and gone in my life, so it’s just a little disappointing to see that it’s gone over a dumb mistake I made of flaming bad enough to where it got me reported and the ban hammer strike me down. Although I understand if I never see it again, that’s just the way it goes; the point to this is, after talking with Chocobro some more, they stated that they were happy with the check-in and just finding out that I’m doing better as a teammate and trying to be a better player. And they said that even if there were a way to prove honorable and unban an account, it’s something that wouldn’t be handled by Player Support and it would be handled by the Developers. So after some convincing since I was very skeptical and just constant thinking of how no one would go for it. Chocobro got me to head over here to suggest an idea because “you never know, if it’s well received, it very well could end up in the game.” And so now here I am to make my suggestion. What if when you are perma-banned, you can have an option to create a second account while your primary is locked, and prove honorable again, like whether hitting Honor Level 4 or 5 or something like that. And once proved honorable and well reformed, like where it clearly shows you’ve changed as a player, you can get your account back? You know, like a Redemption Arc for yourself or something like that. Like I said, it sounds like a touchy subject because there’s so many cases to where it could be different, or some people are just forever toxic. Or even cases to how sometimes players are just honored for doing good stat-wise instead of actual sportsmanship wise. But anyways let me know what you guys think about it!\r\n\r\nTL;DR: What if, when a player gets Perma-banned, they could make a Second Account Tied to the Primary to prove honorable and earn their account back?

I've heard Riot has tried giving permabanned players a chance to reform TWICE and the first one proved unsuccessful, and the second one they would not release the results but they were unhappy with what happened, but I hope someday it is possible for those who truly have reformed and changed for the better.\nI'm sad the players who were still toxic in the two experiments ruined the reformation chances for players who truly cared and wanted their accounts back.\nAlso good for you to be a better teammate! {{sticker:sg-ahri-2}}","replies":[{"poster":"Tross","date":"2020-02-07T05:22:01.681+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah, I think I heard about that not too long ago.
