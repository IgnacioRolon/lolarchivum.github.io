I thought this was a weird Halloween thing Riot was doing, but whenever I logged in today it is still doing it. Does anyone know what is going on?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-01T15:39:58.324+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not sure I understand the issue, and haven't heard of a 'blue client.'
