Back then when people spammed pings I could just /ignore them and move on. Now I have to mute pings from everyone just because of one ass. It has come to a point I don&#039;t even turn the sounds back up after the game, I just run with it at 0 because I&#039;d have to mute it every other game anyway. If you disabled ping muting to increase communication, guess what Riot, it backfired.","replies":[{"poster":"Zaryelle","date":"2017-03-19T18:53:20.108+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"The people that ping effectively almost never go near the limit, so I don't really understand why the ping limit is so high, it's just asking for abuse. It is total bullshit you cannot mute pings.

EDIT: To clarify, I NEED pings to be visible when I mute these people - this is GOOD. I just want an additional way to mute pings. /muteping @CHAMPION or something\n\nit's unnecessarily tilting for everyone to have that one idiot spam ? on someone on your team from start to end on cooldown, happened two games in a row now, wasn't even me he was \"pingflaming\" but it's still incredibly, incredibly, annoying","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Triple6 Murder","date":"2017-03-20T10:35:10.111+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i literally just posted a discussion in the gameplay board for this exact reason\n\nexcept i know of no way to mute or silence just pings i can deal with the image but not the constant sound of a spammed ping\ncan anyone help?\n\nheres my post if anyone would like to up-vote etc, riot needs to sort this out\n\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/YmNyixWF-muting-pings\nprobably posted mine in the wrong place in hindsight","replies":[]}]}
