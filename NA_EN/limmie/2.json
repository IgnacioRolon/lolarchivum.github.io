There he goes, pressing Q. Oh, and there he is again, he&#039;s gonna do it, he&#039;s gonna press Q! And I can&#039;t believe this, he just pressed Q again! And again! What a guy, you never know what he&#039;s up to. He could press Q, or maybe not, who knows? Oh, against all odds, it turned out he pressed Q! Ok, now I know for a fact he&#039;s not gonna press Q one more time. There&#039;s just no way in hell he could repeat the same button press so many times in a row. OMG, what do I know, he just pressed Q! Who could had predicted this? Lemme tell you, he&#039;s a big puzzle, that Skarner. Just when you think you&#039;ve got him all pinned down and figured out he throws you a curveball. And hits Q.
