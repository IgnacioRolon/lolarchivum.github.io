So here&#039;s a quote from Riot Hursker:\n\n>Calling for others to report a player is a punishable offense. It is a form of bullying and as such is against the summoner code. It should always be a personal decision for each player as to whether or not they feel another player warrants a report. In fact, do feel free to tell your team mates that &quot;report calling&quot; in itself counts as harassment. Flaming and bullying a player will never help them to improve their game mechanics, communication etc.\n\nSo if you ever feel the need to say stuff like &quot;x9 this guy&quot; or &quot;report X pls&quot;, don&#039;t. It counts against you more than against them, and it isn&#039;t even needed. What matters is the number of games reported, not the amount of reports per game, so 1 report is as good as 9. If you see somebody behaving in a way you feel it should be reported, report them at the end of the match. That&#039;s all. If they are indeed in the wrong they&#039;ll be dealt with with your report alone. Getting more people to report somebody won&#039;t change anything for them, but it might count against you.","replies":[{"poster":"Smitty Manjensen","date":"2017-01-25T19:09:28.545+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":13,"body":"You're right about everything except the part where the amount doesn't matter, the amount does actually matter, and a guy will be sooner prosecuted who was reported by 3 or more people than a guy who had 1 report, especially if that happens in several games.","replies":[{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-01-25T20:12:57.419+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":2,"body":"All that matters is the amount of games in which you received at least one report, not the amount of reports.
