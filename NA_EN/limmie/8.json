Shame on you all for downvoting him.\n\nAnd as you said, a lil humility goes a long way.   Sheesh..  i get 6 upvotes for being completely wrong and you get 6 downvotes for being right :D  people will follow anyone...","replies":[{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-10-23T01:45:46.867+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"IDK but this is only gonna catch people unaware when preseason hits since the PSA is buried now.

What will be changed regarding OE is that you will get less from disenchanting shards, nothing else. You will also be getting less from disenchanting champion shards too, which is why Rioters themselves are telling people to disenchant both shards before preseason. \n\nBTW you'll **statistically** get more BE if you purchase mystery champion shards now and disenchant them than if you just keep the IP.","replies":[]}]}]}
