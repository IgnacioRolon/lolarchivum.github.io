It doesn&#039;t really eliminate the problems of DQ, just lessens them. Namely:\r\n\r\n1) Legitimate boosting is still allowed, since people can duo with high ranking smurfs and get winrates they wouldn&#039;t get by themselves. That includes **paid** boosting, which is an abomination for any ladder with any semblance of competitive integrity. \r\n\r\n2) It doesn&#039;t completely level the playing field. Duos still have an unfair advantage over solos since they can practice together, have easier access to voice coms and generally work well together. Specially a support/ADC duo.\r\n\r\n3)It makes matchmaking problematic because even though duos can potentially have an advantage, it doesn&#039;t necessarily mean they do. If they don&#039;t put a handicap on duos they&#039;ll have an advantage over the other team if they have things like voice comms or trained together. And on the other hand if they&#039;re just random people that happened to queue together but don&#039;t really have comms or played before etc, then the team hosting them will be on a disadvantage because the system will handicap the matchmaking accounting for an advantage that isn&#039;t really there. \r\n\r\n4)Allowing duos in Solo Queue makes the Flex Queue less viable. Duos and trios complement eachother and 5s are self sufficient, so only 4s need solo players. By funneling duos into the flex queue they don&#039;t need to worry as much about attracting solo players.\r\n\r\nBack when there was only one ladder, it made sense to allow duos into solo queue, because people who wanted to play with a friend would have no other way to do that. But now we have 2 separate ladders and you can be part of both at the same time, so the reason doesn&#039;t exist anymore. Just play solo on solo queue and hop over to flex for the games when you want to premade with friends. Everyone wins.","replies":[{"poster":"WeLoveSenna ","date":"2016-11-09T05:40:16.324+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2016-11-09T05:44:11.859+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you really think getting people to duo with you is something hard to do, you must have really shitty social skills.","replies":[]}]}]}
