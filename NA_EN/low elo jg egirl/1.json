I really miss it. Seeing some people with it makes me really upset. It was rare, and I really loved the team. I never took the icon off. After my perma ban I asked riot support if of all things, could I get my icon back. But no, they pick you out of the account completely. Crushed honestly, none of the new icons really peak my interest.\r\nI would really like it back Riot. Please, I beg of you...","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-17T21:26:02.233+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When an account is banned, it wouldn't mean too much if the person was able to move content off of the banned account onto a new one.
