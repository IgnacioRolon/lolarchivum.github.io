Aside from her ult having a crappy hitbox especially going over top river (doesn't hit where laser is, hits where it isn't) lux is a pretty fair and balanced champion and I'd much prefer fighting her than almost anyone else bc she's less obnoxious and broken. She has no escape, she's squishy, she does no damage when behind, if she misses q she just instantly dies against anyone with a brain. If average with the game she is required to walk up to auto range to proc her passive bc  that is 1/3 to 1/2 of her damage. Yes, she is tough to play against if you feed her, and she doesn't need her passive dmg anymore bc she's supposed to be a hypercarry that's pretty simple to not feed.
