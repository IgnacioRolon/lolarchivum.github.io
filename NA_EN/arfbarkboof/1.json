I didn't play Swain much before, but his ultimate still allows him to drain tank, he still has a root that requires setup to land, and a conditional zone control slow.  He definitely doesn't deal as much DoT as he used to, but his Q can be used fairly often and gives decent DPS if used up close. His physical appearance definitely took a bit of a turn, and I think they could've done more to keep him visually away from Vlad (green demon energy instead of red, shorter hair, kept his clothes more similar to before). Overall though he still appears to fill the same role and do roughly the same things, just in a more interactive way for both players, which is basically the goal of VGUs. If you compare it to the Sion rework, new Sion doesn't function at all like he used to and while I love the new Sion and hated the old one there is definitely an argument that they just deleted the old character and made a new one.","replies":[{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2018-02-12T20:41:35.060+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think they should have given him green magic at all.
