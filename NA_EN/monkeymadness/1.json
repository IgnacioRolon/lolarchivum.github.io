I was here last season on my rise to plat, and it was some of the most competetive LoL I&#039;ve ever played. I know you diamond+ elitists will give me hell for that, but it really was. Most of the games were close, and I was forced to actually get better at the game in order to rank up. I was constantly being challenged and it made me a better player. Now, mid gold is complete trash. Most of my past 20 games (both win and loss) were due to 1 or 2 players that absolutely did not deserve to be in this mmr and just couldn&#039;t play at this level. And before anyone tells me that &quot;bad games happen&quot; or some shit, there&#039;s a big difference between a bad game and going 0/17 (yes, this actually happened, and it wasn&#039;t intentional). I can only assume this is due to DQ boosting people. I know this argument has been beat to death, but DQ has absolute GUTTED the competition in ranked. Games are inconsistent and much less rewarding to play.\n\nEdit: typo in the title: feel* not feed...so used to typing the word \"feed\" now that it just kinda rolled off my fingers...","replies":[{"poster":"PiVoRx","date":"2016-07-01T07:55:48.264+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Diamond 5 is most stacked elo with boosted people, cause if you would like to get boosted then to where?
