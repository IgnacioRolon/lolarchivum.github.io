All lanes DOMINATED. But then, our fed kat started chasing for kills and started to actually feed because of it. Our jungler either felt left out (we totally didn&#039;t need him for ganks) or just went full idiot and started diving 1v5 thinking he could get kills this way, and our team just went to shit. A game that we should&#039;ve won by 20 mins ended up being a loss by 30, and it is solely because people weren&#039;t playing to win. They were playing for stats, kda, the fucking S+ rating, etc. If this is your motivation to play, then stay the fuck out of ranked so that the people who do play to win can climb the ladder.\n\nEdit:\nObviously I'm salty, but my point remains. If you are not playing to win at any and all cost, then just please play normals. That's literally the only reason that Riot has created 2 separate queues. When you join a ranked queue and you don't do everything in your power to win the game, you are actively ruining the game players like me that do take it seriously.","replies":[{"poster":"no mechanics ape","date":"2016-09-15T11:45:30.893+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"All I can say is welcome to plat.
