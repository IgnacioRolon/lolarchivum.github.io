You think having it freeze your rating in Plat would lead to more integrity? \n\n___\n\nLet's make it simple: over enough game, **you get the good team and the bad team half the time each.** So you should get around 50% winrate even if you hold NO INFLUENCE AT ALL on the result. Even if, as you pretend, win-loss is not indicative of your individual skills, you should be at 50%. And you're not, you're below that. So, why?\n\nMoreover, you also pretend that you personally stomp some of your games. This IS your individual skills having an impact on the team's performances, despite what you're saying at other points in your post, and this should bump your winrate even more above 50%. But it doesn't. Again, why?\n\n___\n\nI never reached Plat, but I can pretty consistently reach Gold. I did it 3 times already, starting all the way down in Bronze. I have no difficulties winning in Silver at least until Silver2, and even Silver1 is not that hard. I am really skeptical about a player supposedly better than me having difficulties doing the same. But I checked your profile, and you did reach Plat two years in a row. Up until now, I just talked about how the system works, it wasn't anything personal, it wasn't opinions.\n\nBut here I'm gonna say what I think: you're just on tilt, and you don't know how to adapt. You expect people in Silver to play like the players you were used to meet last season in Plat, and you make stupid plays based on those expectations. When you see the stupid mistakes they do, you rage and you lose focus. And because of THAT, you lose games. Not because people on your team are bad or AFK or feeders, no... Sure, they ARE bad. But the thing is, they are JUST AS BAD in the other team, so that's not why you lose your games. It's not the system's fault, it's not your team's fault. So stop whining on those boards, pull your head out of your arse, and take responsibility for your games.

If you just toss coins, over 20 tosses, you can likely get 6 more head than tail, and that's 65-35. But over 2000 tosses, even if you get 60 more head than tail, it's only 51.5%; in absolute numbers, the difference is 10 times bigger, but you're still much closer to 50%, even if you are not at a \"perfect 50-50\".\n\nBottom line is, the more game you play, the more likely you are to get close to 50-50, and the more easily you can ignore luck.\n\n>  I do believe there are some cases (more frequently in lower elo since there is a denser population) where people are consistently receiving teammates that are very toxic and unskilled regardless of the current game's circumstances\n\nNo. Just no.

Then, every game, you have 1 chance out of 2 to get the good team or the bad team. So, the odds of getting the bad team 100 times in a row are of the order of 10^30.

Starting significantly lower/higher than deserved means it will take longer for it to level out.\n\n>And still, no one has found better yet.\n\nWrong. Overwatch uses a modified elo like League (hidden mmr with a visible skill rating, or SR). In OW though, your team contribution (ie objective time, kills/assists, damage, objective kills, healing, etc contribute to a slight modification of the SR gain/drop. This would be literally perfect for League. You carry but your team feeds hard, you only lose a little bit of LP. You win but get carried, you only gain a little LP. Literally perfect, and in theory will contribute to no net movement on the ladder UNLESS YOU ARE IN AN ELO IN WHICH YOU DO NOT BELONG.\n\n>You ALWAYS have work to do over the course of a Season. It's the fucking point of having a Season at all. Otherwise, they would just keep the rating continuous from one year to the next, without splitting it into different Seasons...\n\nWrong again. I have no problem ending this season in gold, as I start med school in the fall and simply will not have time to grind all the way to plat. I waas perfectly fine at the ranked I SHOULD have been placed at.\n\n>Then how come you only have 40% win rate over 50 games?\n\nAs previously discussed, 50 games is nowhere near statistically significant. Also, that winrate started out at ~20% due to my first 10 games having no fewer than 6 leavers on my teams (reason I went 2-8 and not ~6-4). My winrate has gone nowhere but up since then.\n\n>But here I'm gonna say what I think: you're just on tilt\n\nOh this is certainly true at time, for example, I just played a game where our top lane tryndamere literally did not take masteries. Just went 0/0/0. Not like he was new or something, he had a full rune page, just opted into no masteries. Shit like that tilts me, but in general, I'm not on tilt. As I just said, my winrate has only been going up, and I am climbing, albeit slowly (this is due to matchmaking rng, enemy team has more chance to get the idiot).","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"BLACK REALM GOD","date":"2017-07-10T09:03:51.261+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":9,"body":"dont lie to yourself. you do it for the skin. you couldnt care less about the competitive aspect of the game.","replies":[{"poster":"MonkeyMadness","date":"2017-07-10T09:19:00.490+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I mean, the skin is certainly a nice bonus, yes, but why the fuck would I slog through the much that is this ranked community to get plat 2 seasons in a row if all I cared about was the skin?

I've got so many years to still play and still so many LoL seasons to go, now this could of course go back to refusing to accept my own inability however I've long been aware Gold 1/2 is my limit for now, I saw for now because if my skills can't get better as that is my limit, then they can get worse through neglect or age or anything, so one day it might be gold 3, then gold 4 and so on and so on.\n\nbut is that not the purpose of killing yourself? to end your life so you don't feel pain anymore? yes you don't have any desires anymore then because you stop living but that's a sacrifice you make then right? I choose to sacrifice my desires so that I can stop feeling this pain right now.\n\nbut what about peer pressure in schools? friends around you are drinking and smoking, they encourage you to do it, you do it because they keep pressuring you to do so, are you in that case avoiding ''uprising'' which could also be referred to avoiding bad behavior targeted at you? after all if you don't fit in at school your chances of getting bullied become higher, so in a school setting could ''uprising'' be replaced with bullying?\n\nI suppose that applies to me, I do not excel at anything, at least not yet because I have of course not tried everything yet, the result is that I do not have paid work, granted my Autism no doubt plays a large role in it but surely so does not knowing what one excels at then right?\n\nwhile I am human and live in society if I seclude myself from society I could not gain any knowledge through correct? because of my autism I'm terrible at being social if not down right afraid of saying the wrong thing and extremely nervous and anxious, solution? don't talk to anyone, that resulted in not having any friends ever, and that resulted in me not having to go outside ever, because I figured if I don't have friends what would I go do outside? take walks on my own? go to a club on my own? go drinking alone? that's not fun so instead I stayed secluded in my own room with music, the internet and video games, and I have done this for my entire life, as such I do not have any knowledge of society or human behavior and it did have at least 1 side effect I'm aware of, my english is better than my native language, then again how couldn't it be, with no friends to talk to and chatting and gaming everyday I typed more english than than I spoke my own native language.","replies":[{"poster":"BLACK REALM GOD","date":"2017-07-11T15:47:37.422+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"i know what it's like to type out a well versed reply just to accidentally hit backspace and it erases everything because the page backed.\n\nyou dont know when you're going to die so you might not get to play for many many years. like i said it's a mental loop of illogical fallacies. you say something like \"well i can do this any time. i have all of the time in the world to get better\" then you sit down and try again and end up saying something similar. one excuse leads to another and it's just a complete loop of excuses as to why you cant progress when the reality is that you're not trying to progress. when that happens it's no longer because you can't progress, but instead because you refuse to progress. and just like you said you'll end up getting worse instead of better because people are going to continue to improve while you spin your wheels hoping to magically develop a talent. you dont get better by playing the game repeatedly. you get better by learning and learning is sometimes impossible for some people.\n\nthere is no purpose to killing yourself. it benefits no one. most societies have sworn off cannibalism. whatever purpose you serve in the afterlife will not benefit mankind. Generally speaking religion punishes those who end their own lives so your pains will increase instead of decrease. those who care about you will suffer. those who dont care about you will be unaffected. someone has to pay for the funeral. you take up space in the ground for hundreds of years. genetically speaking your body might have contained the cure for cancer or some other chronic illness. etc. the desire for death is caused by the person losing hope and expecting or being promised release from their suffering. if you were to tell them they could be cured of all things by living another day and they believed you they'd choose to live another day. if you tell someone they'll be cured or freed from suffering by dying you're lying to them. cures are being invented every few years as medicinal science is constantly growing so one day you might actually be able to tell someone \"hey i have the cure\" and mean it. as far as those who suffer from emotional trauma and stress all those people need are for their desires to be fulfilled and to not be humiliated or ridiculed for their inability to do so on their own. if your mind is weak train your body. if your body is weak train your mind. human capital should never be wasted when it can be avoided.\n\nconformity is all about state of mind. if you have a weak state of mind you conform. all of my friends in school smoked, most of them drank, and a lot of them engaged in criminal activity. I was never afraid of losing friends and being alone so when it came to conforming I didnt. i observed the behavior involved and was always around it and to me it just wasnt interesting. for example the rush that you get from street racing is very similar to the rush that you get by riding a roller coaster if you make yourself genuinely believe that you're going to die when you go over the chain lift. the LSD trippy affect can be experience by staying up late, spinning around in circles and then staring into a mirror in the dark then walking through your house half asleep. you can even enhance the effect by playing music in your headphones in reverse or slowed down. if you want to suffer the effects of alcoholism just stay up for 2 days straight and dont drink any water. the exhaustion and dehydration will cause you to feel nauseous and slur your words.\n\nif you want to know what you excel at just remember that every human has basic desires and needs. find a way for you to fulfill your desires and needs by providing a way for others to also fulfill theirs. it's going to require you to think or ask for help. at bare minimum there's always a need for raw labor. so if you're not good with socializing build up your muscles and work as a laborer. lots of people are autistic and lots of people are confused about where they fit in. you just have to take a risk and ask around. if you can find work become a farmer. you'll be able to cut costs on groceries if you're good at it.\n\n^_^ staying in your room doesnt remove you from society. you just said so yourself that you are better at english than your native language. you're fluent in two languages also so that means you could become an interpreter. if you live in an area that sees a lot of english tourists that would mean you have an opportunity there. of course working with others might make it difficult for you, but im sure a taxi or other tourism service would like to have you work for them. there's also phone line interpreting where you interpret between two people who are on the phone.\n\ni know what it's like to lock yourself away and feel like there's no hope. you cant just tell people that they need to have hope or force people to believe that things will change. you have to give them an opportunity to succeed and if you dont you're just wasting your time. so like for you what you need is a mate, money, and something to do that makes you feel like you matter. you already have food, water, and air otherwise you'd be dead. if you can figure out what your skill is (and like i said earlier you're fluent in 2 languages) you can start working towards reversing your illogical fallacy to deny your natural desires. then once you start satisfying your desires you'll start to be happy and enjoy life again.","replies":[{"poster":"BLACK REALM GOD","date":"2017-07-12T01:54:22.166+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it can be used and is used. if you've ever heard of the phrase

to every thought. the one you described is no exception.\n\nthe definition of insanity is sometimes quoted as \"unchanging repetition with unsuccessful results\" or \"doing the same thing over and over again expecting a different outcome\" the actual definition from merriam-websters is\n\n------------\n\nDefinition of insanity\nplural insanities\n\n    1\n    dated :  a severely disordered state of the mind usually occurring as a specific disorder\n\n    2\n    law :  unsoundness of mind or lack of the ability to understand that prevents one from having the mental capacity required by

out while going through the same routine. all that does is train muscle memory and if you're doing something wrong you're going to train your muscles to do the wrong thing. you have to study and think about what you're doing in order to be truly practicing.\n\n\nit doesnt have to benefit others. it is natural to be selfish. those are correct analyses. traditions and routine and empathy allow us to sympathize with others. when we are motivated to protect our family for example we do it for selfish reasons. but dying isnt being selfish. it's being useless and burdensome and thats it. i guess you could say that you're being selfish if you have a desire to harm others or get back at those around you, but that's just another logical fallacy. if they care so much why hurt them? if they dont care then what good does it do to die? they still wont care. you're better off just overcoming them in life. surviving long enough for an illness to have a cure discovered or becoming successful by finding a way to express your talents and make a living. both of those are better options regardless of situation. lots of people talk about mercy killings and things like that, but think about what a mercy killing is. you're assuming that another person/creature wont survive or recover past a certain point - how do you know? the simple answer is you dont. so what is really happening is that you're subconsciously ending someone's life for the self-righteous feeling of making their lives better and doing the right thing. but how can you make someone's life better by ending it? the simple answer is you cant. so logical fallacy. you're benefiting yourself.\n\nby helping others you help yourself. that is the fundamental idea behind society. without that idea society can't exist and we would break down into chaos where the weak are preyed upon by the strong. there are people who believe that that is the correct way to live so yes people do from time to time develop into murderers and rapists among other things. but the idea of prey upon the weak is a flawed idea to begin with because it goes against the natural law that there will always be someone stronger. humans age and get sick so if you live a life preying upon the weak eventually you're going to be preyed upon as well. society is safer and more beneficial overall than chaos. some people though sink or are born so low into society that they cant see any way to escape and because of their weak mind revert to natural instinct. it's sad and if you watch closely to those around you you can see it happen.\n\nintroverts vs extroverts is the outcome of people learning how to achieve their desires differently. naturally speaking we socialize to mate basically. in society we learn that by socializing in certain ways we can make our lives easier. so if we're for instance one of the \"weak\" and someone who believes that preying on the weak is how things should be decides to bully us we might start to avoid communicating with others to avoid being bullied. on the other hand if we're one of the strong or admired and people start to flock to us we might desire that security of having people around us at all times. sort of like a herd. then there's the addiction of socializing that occurs when someone become entirely reliant on others to achieve their desires or needs. these are usually children who are sheltered or spoiled by their parents. if you're always having someone do something for you you'll never develop the skills needed to do it on your own and there's a certain amount of knowledge that you're expected to know by the time you reach adulthood or you'll be ridiculed by society. \n\nto the point of your question though it all depends. introverts and extroverts are equally susceptible to peer pressure. it has to do with how well you as a person can reason and analyze your unique situation. peer pressure usually starts with a promise that is meant to manipulate you into thinking your desires or needs will be fulfilled by doing something and then what happens is the person has a choice to make as to believe the promise or dont believe it. the promise made doesnt even have to be one that someone else inflicts on you. it could just be an incorrect mental association between two  things like \"shopping here will make me popular\".\n\nthe problem with living off of the government is that you never know if that money will continue. you should still at least try to grow a lot of your own food. it does take a bit of effort, but if you have some windowsill peppers or a terrace garden (i dont what sort of house and land you have) i think it would help. also you have the option of scrap metal recycling and grass cutting if your area participates in it. i dont know if that affects the money you receive on a legal level, but i know for a fact as long as you're the only one eating your own crops no one will say anything. as far as that goes if you cant work a paid job you cant work a paid job. it's not like you didnt try. i'd still try to develop a skill, though. it can be anything from art or whatever. especially if you have time on your hands. living at the governments table makes it hard to do anything extraordinary because of lacking funds.\n\n\nthere are people exactly like you who need someone to spend the rest of their lives with. your dog which you mentioned only lives for a quarter of the human lifespan. the rest of the time you'll be by yourself. the same goes for whoever this other person might be. in a healthy relationship both members bring equal amounts of effort to the table to start with and then as you spend time together the trust should make up for the burdens that will eventually befall you both. there's nothing wrong with admiring someone who has more to offer than most, but in life realizing your limits and accepting those limits will allow you to appreciate others in a way that is more rational. asking if it's fair to someone you just met without knowing what they desire will prevent you from moving forward. let them decide if it's fair or not. in the mean time just enjoy their company. that might be hard at first, but once you start to get back to normalizing your desires you should be fine. if the person leaves you'll suffer a huge setback, but that's to be expected. just start from square one and work yourself back up with a goal of surpassing your most recent highscore figuratively speaking. people (myself included) get so hung up on the idea that there may not be a tomorrow so we tend to rush things like marriage and such. as long as youre fulfilling your desires from time to time thats all you really need to be happy.","replies":[]},{"poster":"hhaavviikk","date":"2017-07-11T18:03:10.735+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=BLACK REALM

I'll avoid religion else this could go on forever heh.\n\nisn't that looking at it purely from the outside and the positive and negatives of those? sure I could have found the cure to cancer, then again I also could have gone insane and murdered a bunch of people, all of those possibilities exist at the same time, sure those around me may suffer because I die, however is it fair for me to continue to suffer for years because they do not want to suffer? it comes back to caring more about yourself than others, I agree that you shouldn't kill yourself and it's a waste considering what you could have done but having been there the mind doesn't think about others, after all why think ''does this benefit others'' when it is ''others'' who caused them to get into such a depression in the first place, that would require a great deal of selflessness which surely most humans do not have.\n\nthat does sound like it makes sense, those with weak minds are easily swayed of course, however what if you were someone who needs friends? whereas you have introverts or ''wall flowers'' who could do just fine alone there are also extroverts who need to be out and about with friends who need that social interaction, does that mean extroverts more often conform to smoking and alcohol and the like in order to fit in and thus have allot of social interaction?\n\nI have tried several things, a farm, a IT work place, a storage house, animal shelter, retail store, and with all of them the same issue arose, Autism, perhaps because I've never gotten any sort of help or guidance with it that it has gotten this bad, can't handle sounds, even if it's jsut 4 people talking if I listen to that for 5 minutes I get a headache and feel very uncomfortable, I quickly tire out, terrible socially, I've got ''classical autism'' which as far as I know is a severe form of it so perhaps that's why it's impacting my life so much.\n\ntrue it doesn't remove me from society though it does prevent me from learning about human behavior and social ques and such. \n\nI do like you're realistic with that, I do so hate people who say ''why be depressed, kids in africa have it worse'' yes well I'm not in africa so that is irrelevant.\n\nas it stands after questioning me and researching my past it has been decided that I'm incapable of paid work, which means I get paid by the government and in return what I have to do is 2 days a week for 3 hours each spend some hours at voluntary work, so the search for paid work truly is over, though before that I had 2 companies helping me search for a job, and even that was to no avail, the upside is that I can live on my own with the money I get, I dare say if I still lived with my mother I'd have killed myself, she is unbearable.\n\nthe thought of a partner certainly crossed my mind but I thought would it be fair to the other person if I needed them to fulfill my desires or if I need them to be happy? wouldn't that place a burden or pressure on them?","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
