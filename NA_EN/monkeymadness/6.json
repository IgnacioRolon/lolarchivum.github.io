Riot tweaked this item to better synergize with assassins, and it does a very good job in my opinion. The true damage on hit makes the item function much more consistently than how it used to (with the % missing hp burst). However, it is STILL being abused by marksmen. The whole point of these itemization changes was to stop ADCs from using assassin items for the unintended synergies (ie attack speed buff on youmuu&#039;s giving a huge %AD buff to jhin). And while these itemization changes did stop marksmen from building youmuu&#039;s, I still see jhin building duskblade, and now I&#039;m seeing vayne build it, too. This is so unhealthy for the game, especially on vayne, as her shiv/rapidfire cannon + tumble + ult bonus dmg + duskblade proc + ie crit is basically a one shot on squishy targets, and because she can no longer be revealed during stealth, it&#039;s also pretty low risk.\r\n\r\nHere is my incredibly simple suggestion: duskblade passive only works for melee attackers. Done. So simple. This makes it a great pick up on assassins, but useless on the ranged champs that are currently abusing the fuck out of it.","replies":[{"poster":"khorney","date":"2016-11-13T00:02:27.804+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"dude stop whining about things, and so what if vayne gets it it makes sense for her since the lehtality is good on her and becuase she can take advantage of duskblade because you can only use it if you are not spotted...... and jhin cant build attack speed and has a max of what 5 shots then he reloads.......","replies":[{"poster":"MonkeyMadness","date":"2016-11-13T00:28:51.970+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":">jhin cant build attack speed and has a max of what 5 shots then he reloads.......\n\n.\n>max of what 5 shots then he reloads.......\n\n.\n>5 shots\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/wnIaRyJ.gif?noredirect","replies":[{"poster":"khorney","date":"2016-11-13T01:05:26.574+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"and yet your still complaining about stupid stuff....... ghost blade no longer gives attack speed so i do not know why your complaining about certain things","replies":[{"poster":"MonkeyMadness","date":"2016-11-13T01:18:11.213+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok, I was kidding with that triggered comment because it fit so well, but now I can see that you are not actually reading my post.

Maw was still incredibly relevant even after the so called \"nerfs\" the item wouldn't keep it's ability to stack with sterak's since it made ANYONE who stacked them together a pain to deal with due to the double shields. It made Mages incredibly ineffective against ANYONE who stacked them together. It was going to get removed whether or not ADCs where using it.
