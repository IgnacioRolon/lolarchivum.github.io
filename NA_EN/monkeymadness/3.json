Those that try to oppose the main point are instantly labelled as 'evil' or in laymans terms 'toxic'. It doesn't matter how good you try to be in game and uphold sportsman ship. It doesn't matter how much effort and thought you put into a point as long as it opposes the 'x is bad' mentality whatever you're saying will be shunned. In a similar fashion, loosely thought out comment like what you have written here will be agreed with on sight. Doesn't matter how little thought is put into it. It doesn't matter what actually thinking about the details actually shows the true meaning entails it will just be labelled as good, upvoted bombed and everything against it will downvoted either to attempt to piss off the other side or in an attempt to make the original message of the post correct without opposition.\n\nThere are toxic people who oppose this. But in the same light there are also non-toxic people who oppose this because your reactions are extremely overboard and dissagree with the 'league is a sport and should be treated like one' mentality. They are not saying that that the game should deteriorate into a state where everyone can be complete dicks to each other but it's more along the lines of its a game so they would rather it not be as restricted as a sport, no, a _professional_ sporting setting as often times people try to equate it to some Major League Baseball game but the thing is at the very least _half_ of the people playing the game see it as a video game. If they wanted a sports setting they'd probably be play FIFA, NBA or NFL games.","replies":[{"poster":"StarGuardianWeeb","date":"2017-07-15T18:36:07.630+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Cowseed","date":"2017-07-15T20:10:31.639+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"Reread how you just spoke to me and then compare it to someone saying GGEZ.
