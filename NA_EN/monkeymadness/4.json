I&#039;ll try to post a TL;DR at the end of this.\n\nLet me start with a bit of history about me: I used to be a complete dick in this game. I admit to that. I was the classic blame and flame. I used to say &quot;gg&quot; every time my team gave up firstblood, and I was a complete asshat to any of my teammates that were playing any less than perfect. I got A LOT of bans. And I mean a shitload. It was bad, and I just didn&#039;t learn from them. I was probably pretty close to a permaban, but I avoided any and all racism, sexism, and homophobic remarks, which was probably my one saving grace. But, around mid season 5, I got a 2 week timeban for saying &quot;gg afk&quot; (as ridiculously harsh as that might be) and then followed up with nearly 200 consecutive games of restricted chat, so I decided to take some time to seriously clean up my act. I stayed out of ranked games for about a month until I had managed to mellow out, and then I remained restriction free for a reasonable period of time. Then came the reset, where all accounts had their punishment history stricken and everyone started out on a clean slate, and I managed to avoid punishment for well over a year, a huge accomplishment for me.\n\nThen, I hit plat elo in season 6. I sincerely wish I had just waited until the end of the season so I wouldn&#039;t be tempted to keep playing at this level. For anyone that&#039;s with me in low plat, I&#039;m assuming you know how horrible it is. From what I&#039;ve heard, low diamond is the same way, but at least you guys don&#039;t have to deal with premades up there. Anyways, I started noticing myself slipping, so I tried to dial it back and started using the mute function much more frequently to avoid tilting and raging. But then, about a week ago, I slipped a bit. A guy on my team was just being a complete jerk to everyone. Told people to drink bleach, that their parents should&#039;ve drank bleach, etc, and then to cap it all off, he started to intentionally feed. I lost my cool, and I called him a c**t, then promptly muted him. Obviously, I should not have done this. But I did. I got 10 game chat restrict. Not sure 1 toxic word (not even a whole toxic sentence) warrants a 10 game chat restrict, but whatever. I took it in stride, and thought that a slight slap on the wrist would do me some good in the long run and maybe help me refocus on avoiding toxicity. And it did. I finished out my 10 games, quickly started earning hextech loot again, and went on my merry way. \n\nUntil about 2 hours ago, everything was fine. I did my best to avoid in-game conflict, muted players that were getting overly aggressive, and just tried to focus on myself when possible. But then, I got matched in the single most classic shit game you can imagine. Right at the start, I wanted to dodge. I should&#039;ve dodged, but I gave the guy the benefit of the doubt and played it. He was our mid laner, and declared right at the start that he was a &quot;one trick fiora&quot;. Unfortunately for everyone, our top laner didn&#039;t see that, and picked fiora. When the troll realized that someone had taken &quot;his&quot; champion, he announced that he would be trolling, and picked udyr mid. Again, I do not know why I (or someone else, for that matter) didn&#039;t dodge (btw Riot, please, we need some mechanism to stop people from doing shit like this). I muted him immediately at the start of the game. I and the fiora went into all chat and declared that udyr admitted to trolling, and requested reports if he followed through on his threat. The udyr died 3 times in the first 3 minutes (I cannot say if these were intentional deaths or not, I was focusing on myself at the time). I confirmed with the enemy team that he was trolling, and requested that they help us out with a report. Our udyr promptly afked and remained on the summoner&#039;s platform for the next ~10 minutes. The fiora and I kept the enemy team updated on the shitty situation, and for the most part, they were apologetic to our plight. The udyr came back at around 15 minutes and ran straight into my jungle and started stealing camps. Moral of the story is that he returned before the LeaverBuster could catch him, and then participated just enough that he wouldn&#039;t get caught deliberately trolling. However, given all the bullshit that was going on, our adc announced that he/she was also done, and started running down bot and shoving out the lane until he/she would get caught out alone and die. This solidified our defeat, and again, the Fiora and I went into all chat to ask for reports. Now, I am fully aware that asking for reports is &quot;toxic&quot; as it only inflames the situation. But we had 2 trolls. Two admitted, intentionally feeding, game-ruining trolls, and this was a platinum level ranked game. This is not a case of me raging and requesting a report because I&#039;m salty and tilted, these were two players that admitted IN CHAT (and/or champ select) that they were intentionally going to lose the game. High elo ranked should not have these issues, and I feel rather justified in my anger towards these two. Needless to say, I got my second chat ban, 25 games. \n\nSo now I&#039;m on strike 2 of 4. I know the next infraction will result in an automatic 14 day time ban, and anything following will be an immediate permaban. Both of the punishments mentioned above cited only single games in the Reform Card, so it would appear that I am getting punished for literally single game slip ups. What&#039;s worse, in both games, the original aggressor (troll) was not punished (or at least, I didn&#039;t receive notice that my report resulted in a ban). I have felt for a while now that Riot&#039;s behavioral analysis team engages in regular victim blaming, but now that I have fallen victim to it so severely, I honestly don&#039;t know what to do. A full year of self-reflection and working to keep my account free of restrictions has now been undone in a week thanks to these most terrible of people who seek to actively and deliberately ruin the game for others. Now, my account is flagged again, which means punishments will come MUCH faster, and seeing as how punishment history was said by a Rioter to be effectively permanent, it&#039;s really only a matter of time before I have another slip up and add that third strike to my account, putting me at serious risk of a permaban. I am now legitimately afraid to use the chat function, and I have been starting the last few games by muting all players in order to avoid even the risk of verbal conflict. But this completely and utterly defeats the purpose of the game. This is a team game, a game that is meant to employ coordination and communication (and not just pings). I feel that Riot has successfully discouraged any in-game social interaction under threat of punishment. There is NO possibility of having strikes removed (or at least, this is very unlikely to occur, according to the Rioter post I will link below) meaning that even if a player does reform, the chances are VERY high that they will still escalate up to higher levels of punishment. This is wrong on so many levels, and the only solution I see is a complete avoidance of in-game chat all together. I have already started using the /mute all function at the start of every game I play out of fear that even reading someone&#039;s toxic message might tilt me enough to say the one thing that get&#039;s me banned. \n\n\n\nok, TL;DR\nAfter over a year of keeping my account free of restrictions (a good achievement for me) my account is now flagged again, and I&#039;ve already managed to escalate to the second tier of punishments within a week. Both punishments came from games in which I lashed out against a player who was intentionally feeding, or otherwise playing in a manner that indicated an intent to lose the game. In all reality, I was reported by these very same players. I am now afraid to use the chat function, and I feel like the game will no longer be fun at all for me, as Riot is actively discouraging social interaction by threatening with permabans. And given the oversensitive nature of the community and the ban bot, now that my account is flagged, it will be very easy for me to hit the next level of punishment. I feel like I am being punished for being the victim in this case, as I am RARELY (if ever) the initial aggressor.\n\n\nNote: if Riot reads this and posts my chat log, I want everyone to remember that context is key, and in both games for which I was chat banned, there was a person that was intentionally feeding (and they even admitted this in chat, I am not just being overly critical of their kda).\n\nhere is the link to the current policy on escalating restrictions:\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/Boqd81O0-upcoming-upgrades-to-chat-restrictions","replies":[{"poster":"Guiboulou","date":"2016-09-24T14:30:38.219+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":1,"body":"Riot is not \"actively discouraging social interaction by threatening with permabans\".

The history of this game has always been based around multiple reports in a single game holding more weight. I'm not actually sure I even like this idea, as having multiple reports may indicate a more severe offense. But honestly, both systems have their pros and cons, so let's not debate that. \n\nThe real issue is, Riot is actively ignoring the context of bans. There is a reason why in real criminal court, we have a jury determining guilt or innocence instead of just one person, and why they examine ALL evidence, not just the evidence that implies guilt. Riot is acting as judge, jury, and executioner, and this is a problem. They have demonstrated  clear bias in that they prefer to ban verbal offenders to a much higher extent than trolls and other players that actively engage in behavior indicative of intentionally losing a game. In my opinion (and the opinions of many other competitive players) this second group is FAR worse for game health than people like me. I'm not saying everything I do is justified. I lose my cool from time to time, and in previous seasons, I welcomed the occasional chat ban. They served to force me to calm down and refocus on the game instead of on the chat. But the fact that I am now on the fast track to a permaban for lashing out against a troll is utterly ridiculous. THAT is what I'm protesting here. If Riot wants to keep putting me on restricted chat for this, then fine. I can deal with that. What I can't deal with is losing my account while someone who actively intentionally feeds is allowed to do so restriction-free.","replies":[{"poster":"Guiboulou","date":"2016-09-25T00:13:21.012+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You think they're allowed to do so restriction-free, but they most likely aren't.

You only get the report feedback pop up if your report was the last one to get them banned. ^_^ So just because the system doesn't tell you doesn't mean they haven't been or won't be punished. :P Just keep that in mind. I'd recommend venting out loud next time you feel the need to lash out. Keep the chat clean and you'll eventually go back down in the punishment ladder.

Even though it's obvious for everyone in game, unless the person actually runs down a lane to die at tower, it's virtually impossible for riot to detect it. If they do the shit like solo push bot lane until someone comes in and kills them (by far the most common int feed method I've seen this season), Riot will give them the benefit of the doubt that they are either just farming or perhaps split pushing, and pardon them.\n\nCorrection: it's not IMPOSSIBLE for Riot to detect non-verbal trolling (int feed, troll picking because a player didn't get their preferred role, etc), they just don't want to expend the necessary resources to catch players that do this.

This means they will try anything immoral, unethical, disrespectful, rude, and etc to get you angry. Since you will be stuck with this person for 20 minutes to sometimes even hours, you can't expect people to hold in anger and be 'rational'.

They seek to actively ruin the game for all other players they encounter, and they do so intentionally. As long as players like this are allowed to continue playing (and they clearly are being allowed), this game will be among the most toxic in history.

Also, though it's far more common to see people complain about verbal abuse bans than gameplay trolling/griefing bans both kinds do indeed get punished. That being said though however, just because Person A acts up doesn't mean that you can act up and have your negative behavior ignored.

When you verbally abuse or harass someone by calling them \"f***ing ******\" or \"n*gger noob\", that's when you've crossed the line and will be punished by the Tribunal. I've said this before and I'll say it again, we aren't trying to clean online games of adult language; we're trying to reform or get rid of jerks who like to verbally abuse and harass other players.\n\n>**4) That player in my game was far worse than me. Why am I banned???**\na) I'll keep this one simple: retaliation isn't OK. Reacting to a toxic player by being toxic just incites that player to be even worse--it also ruins the game for up to 8 other players. It is far, far worse to watch two people yelling at each other all game than it is to watch 1 player ranting into blank space. Almost everyone in the game can find someone out there that behaves worse than they do--but so what? Finding someone worse doesn't justify your behavior or justify retaliation. We expect more out of our players. What players often don't realize is... those other players in your game that you thought were worse? Nearly 100% of the time, those players were banned even before you were. If someone is being toxic, just report them and move on. If you retaliate, both of you will be banned.

That would be when retaliation is punishable. However, League doesn't work like many games. You can be stuck with the same person for hours who may psychologically, mentally, or emotionally torture you. The retaliation has a completely different punishment when you think about that.

Just because you have trouble reforming and keeping your behavior in check doesn't mean that it can't be done.","replies":[{"poster":"MonkeyMadness","date":"2016-09-25T21:04:41.677+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":">By simply taking a break\n\nSo by making the victim take extra precaution so as not to be victimized further.

Once you are flagged, regardless of how valid it was (and in my case it was valid for many years) you are fucked. Even if you reform, single offenses get you banned. This is proven fact, as anyone that has a long history of being banned. It takes very little to be punished after your account is flagged, regardless of how much you've reformed.\n\nAs for the permanence of the \"flag\" please read this comment by a Rioter\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/Boqd81O0-upcoming-upgrades-to-chat-restrictions?comment=00030000\n\nYour statement as to how removing the \"flag\" works is equally vague and disheartening as this comment. No further information was given as to how this reform process works, meaning that Riot simply doesn't care. Punishment in League has become strictly punitive. Reform is no longer the goal.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
