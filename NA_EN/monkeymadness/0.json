I know I&#039;m guilty of this, and now that I am able to reflect on it after the fact, it&#039;s fucking bullshit. The worst part is that I didn&#039;t do this consciously, meaning that this kind of response is basically a reflex. It needs to stop.

Example: player gets pissy because the jungler didn't gank, so player reports the jungler for verbal abuse just because. The review reveals that the jungler said \"fuck you\" to someone in that game. Jungler now has his first strike towards a punishment, even though he wasn't actually toxic at all.

Someone thought I was trolling by playing pantheon support, when in fact I was just trying to make my autofill support game a bit more fun by picking something unconventional. Turns out that during that game, I announced in all chat that this player was being abusive toward me in chat (which was true) and I asked that they report him (I know this doesn't really help, but it makes me feel better to know that I at least have people on my side).

Fact is, this is another way Riot warps statistics to keep us players in the dark as to how they actually do things. There is absolutely no way to measure the \"strictness\" of the Tribunal, nor is there even a way to qualitatively measure levels of toxicity, as toxicity is a strictly qualitative observation and therefore cannot be measured in any capacity. Perhaps the Tribunal was stricter than Riot believed it would be, but it is nowhere near as strict as the ban bot is now, ESPECIALLY with regard to players with flagged accounts, regardless of the efforts take to reform (I have firsthand knowledge of this). \n\nAlso, and this is critically important: the Tribunal was given the ENTIRE chat log for both teams throughout the entire game. The ban bot only reviews the reported player's chat. This means that the new system entirely disregards the context of the reported player's chat. And before you tote the party line (which I can feel you typing already) that \"you and you alone are responsible for your actions, therefore context doesn't matter\", please enlighten me again as to why in actual courts of law judges and juries are presented with all available evidence in order to come to a verdict.

If you can't provide a means to explain how such information can be measured QUANTITATIVELY (that means with numbers) then it is by definition a subjective statement at best, a false statistic at worst. Note: I'm not saying that the Tribunal was more or less strict than predicted, I'm merely saying that you're assertion of such an exact statistic is bullshit. However, regardless of the strictness of the original Tribunal, the current system is FAR stricter, in that PEOPLE ARE BEING PERMANENTLY SUSPENDED FOR ACTIONS THAT WOULD PREVIOUSLY ONLY GET THEM CHAT RESTRICTED. That is the point of the escalating punishments, and it's borderline unethical.

It's always football, why do people also go for football? It's as if they think football will get them more respect. Ok, here we go, assuming you did play football, not having a \"win at all costs\" attitude pretty much gets you universally hated and almost exclusively benched. I learned this hard way when I played in middle school and decided to skip the winter conditioning sessions so I could join a club. BIG mistake for my football \"career\", and one that took me years to live down. As for your other sports, they are all individual competitions. There is a very different mindset required when you can only depend on yourself to win. Now I fully understand that many high school track meets will combine scores and such to determine which team \"won\" the meet, but even still, you are not competing in your even with a team (unless you are running a relay, but even still, the team dynamic is not the same as traditional \"team\" sports).\n\nAnd no one has the right to be self-righteous.

I'm self-righteous because I'm confident in myself. I'm not pretending to anything.

Self-righteousness and arrogance are two different things. \n\nBut, I get that you have to paint me as an asshole because yours is the child's argument: _You're wrong and you lie._ That's fine.\n\nThat being said, let's talk football. I come from a very large family of craftsmen and women. My dad was a tool-and-die maker. I grew up on a farm. As you can imagine, my family is big into sports. My mom was a semi-professional tennis player. My dad was a wrestler.\n\nDad was also into baseball. All through my childhood, we would go to a half-dozen games a year at Wrigley Field. I can't stand the sport, however. My lady friend (at my age, divorces and blended families are a reality, so exact terminology is a delicate thing) is a huge Tigers fan, but that's not a thing we do together.\n\nAnd you're absolutely right that I was drawn to cycling and track because of the solitude. It's the same reason I have a high appreciation for tennis - even as I suck at it. My maternal grandfather, however, was into football. His family came from Wisconsin, so we would combine a visit with seeing the Packers play. I have many fond memories of huddling under a huge blanket with him, listening to the deep rumble of his play-by-play.\n\nThen he got cancer. This being the 70's and my grandfather coming from a generation where men just didn't go to the hospital for \"trivial pains\", by the time he was diagnosed, it had spread everywhere. Two months later, my parents snuck me into the hospital to say goodbye. As we watched him go, I was struck by how withered he was. He had been such a large, vibrant man, always ready with a smile and a hug. Later, as the family sat shivas, my grandmother showedme his Packers jacket and hat as she stored them away, telling me that I would grow into them eventually.\n\nFast forward to high school, where I was the second-smallest boy in my class. I so desperately wanted to fit in and sports was the way to do it. I got on the JV team my freshman year, mostly out of sheer determination and discipline. Coach was a big fan of \"playing cold\", which sometimes meant literally. Everything was punished with laps. Drop a pass? Laps. Miss a tackle? Laps. Use profanity anywhere in school and coach heard about it? More laps.\n\nNow, the laps didn't count unless coach saw them, so that sometimes meant getting to school before sunrise and doing them - in t-shirt and gym shorts in Michigan winter - while he sat there, not-so-surreptitiously sipping from a flask. I have a smart mouth, so I did a LOT of laps.\n\nI made varsity my sophomore year because I was fast, tenacious and I ran my routes precisely. I played as though I had something to prove - because I did. Growing up watching Walter Payton put his shoulder down and drive through safeties, I did that too and started to get a reputation as someone to be feared. Double-teams became common, as did driving me into the turf on as many tackles as possible. I played with dislocated fingers, because that's what you do when you come from a farm, born to middle-class parents who got there by never giving up, going through life as the small, smart kid. That's what you do when perfection is the only way to be seen.\n\nI got my growth spurt that summer and put on twenty pounds of muscle. I scored five touchdowns against our division rival, a much larger school with much larger players, sending us to state for the first time in a decade. After that game, I came home to find that jacket and hat on my bed, along with a note that said, \"I guess you're big enough now.\"\n\nI still have the hat, though I don't wear it any more. It sits on my dresser with some other memories. The jacket I wore until it basically fell apart. My mom cut out the logo and made it into a blankie for my niece, who loved it until it didn't make it out of the washer.\n\nSo, when your argument is that I couldn't have played football because of some bullshit idea you have in your head, my only response is to tell you to [redacted], which is something I can say here because this isn't in-game.","replies":[{"poster":"MonkeyMadness","date":"2017-01-19T21:04:42.463+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Definition of self–righteous\n:  convinced of one's own righteousness especially in contrast with the actions and beliefs of others :  narrow-mindedly moralistic\n\nsee also, Ulanopo","replies":[{"poster":"Ulanopo","date":"2017-01-19T22:47:10.757+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwLRQn61oUY\n\nLove the song, hate the video.\nMakes my point, though.\n\nAs to the larger discussion, I continue to reject the notion that you can't control what you type.

That's my prerogative as someone who disagrees with you. What you misunderstand is that I have never been biased against you or your ideas. I read what you wrote - and continue to do so, by the way - and responded directly to it each time, even including a very heartfelt memory of losing my grandfather to cancer. You still haven't apologized for calling me a liar, by the way. \n\n>Fact: you are intolerant to people different from you. \n\nDisagreement is not intolerance. What you are attempting is erasure via ad hominem. If you can paint me as the bad guy, my ideas can be ignored. Well, I'm not going away and this line of attack doesn't work with me, so maybe try something else?\n\n>The real world does not enforce the same behavioral principles as Riot, and that puts Riot games staunchly in opposition of actual mentality.\n\nI'm Jewish, _so the house next door doesn't enforce the same behavioral principles as mine._ Nicest pagans you ever met, by the by. The point is that our different values don't make our values irrelevant in our own homes.\n\nTruth is, the world is a patchwork of values and social mores.  Saying \"Riot is wrong because they're not consistent with group X\" is pretty silly when there are millions of groups out there. \n\n>In the real world, if someone criticizes you, you don&#x27;t get to call the police and have them arrested. But Riot does essentially just this.\n\nRiot doesn't do that at all. You can't go to prison for breaking the Summoner's Code. Riot doesn't have local ordinances to force you to mow your lawn or paint your fence.\n\nWhat they do have is a contract you signed stating that you will and will not do certain things. One of those things is not being a jerk to other players, regardless of how much you think you were provoked.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"La Belle Sauvage","date":"2017-01-31T21:02:09.812+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is super simple. \n\nDon't bite/respond ECT. \n\n\nSince you point how easy it is to be reported then don't respond in kind.

It's a kneejerk reaction, and it in the case of League, more psychologically motivated than anything else. If someone is harassing you, and you are literally forced to take it up the ass and be a victim (which is what Riot demands you do) it just makes you feel like shit. Standing up for yourself and fighting back at the very least makes you feel like less victimized and more in control of your own situation instead of letting some fuckwad control you. And before you say \"just report them, they'll get banned\" well, maybe they will. Maybe they'll get banned. Or maybe (and more likely) your report will NOT be the one to trigger the ban. Or maybe they aren't toxic with enough frequency to get a ban (this is the case of people who  have never been banned, mind you. If your account is flagged, it doesn't matter. 3 toxic games in any duration of time = next punishment, my most recent reform ticket included games that were literally months apart). Regardless of reason, it is very unlikely that you will get that glorious notification that they were banned, meaning that you just took it up the ass for literally no reason, and that feels like shit.","replies":[{"poster":"Silent Gravity","date":"2017-02-12T05:26:25.548+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MonkeyMadness,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=YzA7vrn5,comment-id=00060000,timestamp=2017-01-31T21:14:44.381+0000)\n>\n>  instead of letting some fuckwad control you\n\nBut, you're letting them control you.
