And literally every champion is useless if you dodge their skillshots. You have listed precisely 0 counterplay measures specific to yasuo. Let me give you a great example: Aurelion Sol: counterplay by staying inside his stars so he is either forced to ult you away, or flash to repositiion. THAT is counterplay. What you have listed is just regular LoL mechanics for fighting any fed enemy. And seeing as how the only counterplay for yasuo is to treat him like a fed enemy regardless of what happens, you have just proven that something is not right with the balance of this champ.","replies":[{"poster":"WhatAGeinius","date":"2016-07-18T08:01:12.378+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Uhm, yeah, they are counterplay tips that work for nearly every champion (CC doesn't hinder all champions equally by the way, squishy characters suffer a lot more from it), that doesn't mean that it doesn't apply to Yasuo too???\n\nIf you want specific points then fine, I'll repeat the ones that people are told _literally every time_ the monthly shift of the boards hate train puts Yasuo in their sights.\n\nIf playing a ranged character, use your autoattacks to pop his shield whenever it's up before you harass with your abilities. If you're melee and you aren't a support there's like a 90% chance that you counter the shit out of Yasuo and you can pretty much just kill him by throwing your stats at him so don't worry about it.\n\nWhen it comes to his Q, you are given a lot of warning when his third Q is up. The skill shot is really slow so just stand a good distance away from him until he throws it or the timer runs out and you can easily sidestep it. If he has his 3rd Q and you see him dash to a minion in your direction, make sure you move away from your minion wave as quickly as possible.\n\nWindwall is pretty tricky I'll admit, it's big weakness is that it has a really long cooldown (26 seconds at first rank and no one that plays Yasuo is going to put a second point into it until they absolutely have to), so when it's off cooldown throw your abilities out one at a time instead of comboing them so he can't windwall your combo and engage you while all of your abilities are on cooldown. This way he either has to let you keep harassing him or use up his windwall to block just one ability, which still leaves you with the other 2-3 if he tries to engage, and for the next 26 seconds you can use your abilities freely without having to worry about Windwall. Of course all of this is assuming that you're ranged because if that's not the case windwall does nothing against your autoattacks and as mentioned previously it is extremely likely that you are playing a champion that can just flex him to death.\n\nHis E allows him to dash as many times as there are enemies in range which gives him a lot of mobility so long as there are enemies nearby in the direction he wants to dash, so be aware of where you're standing. Some weaknesses of it are that it has a pretty slow animation for a dash and it is fully interruptible by CC unlike most dashes. It's range is the same as his Q, just for reference. In general, the best way to deal with his dash are to A. not stand in your minion wave, keep some distance from it so you can easily get out of follow-up dash range when you see him dash to a minion and B. try to freeze the wave so that his minions are just outside tower range and your minions and mostly under tower. This way, he can't use his mobility whatsoever as all of his dashes (I.E. your minions) would require him to be under your tower. Keep in mind that to even use his E or stack his Q he HAS to push the wave, so getting the wave into this position isn't very difficult at all if you understand wave manipulation.\n\nHis E-Q gives him some AOE and allows him to apply his knockup without having to use his slow-moving easily dodgeable skillshot, but the two big weaknesses of it are that it has shorter range than a regular Q as well as a noticeably longer animation in which he can't move or do anything. One trick you can use if you leave yourself open and he manages to target you with his dash is to run _towards_ and _through_ him, this usually means that he'll dash well past you and whiff his Q which gives you an ample opportunity to punish him with a combo while he's stuck in his twirling animation and can't defend himself. Of course how successful this maneuver is depends on where you were standing when Yasuo started his dash, closer being better, but it's a useful piece of tech to know.\n\nFinally, his ult is a pretty strong ability when it can be used optimally, however it has an _enormous_ weakness in that it can't be used whatsoever unless the target is airborne which means that a pretty significant amount of the time he effectively only has 3 abilities. The best counterplay to his ultimate is, of course, not to let yourself be knocked airborne, so if you're 1v1 against him just use the aforementioned methods of avoiding his knockup. Of course this isn't always going to be possible if his teammates have displacement effects that are reliable but if it was then he would _never_ be able to use his _freaking ultimate_ so you have to give him some leeway here, especially considering that there are almost no abilites that can _always_ be outplayed in every single scenario. \n\nOne thing you can always do, however, is keep in mind where you are in relation to your teammates. The biggest strength of his ultimate is it's ability to suppress multiple members of the enemy team simultaneously, so if he has his 3rd Q or if someone on the enemy team has an AoE displacement effect that's off cooldown, make sure your team isn't lined or clumped up. So long as he can't ult the majority of your present team members (which he won't very often be able to if you mind your positioning) then you can punish him pretty easily. His ultimate requires him to teleport directly next to his target and suppress _himself_ for a full second as well, so as long as you have teammates nearby who didn't let themselves get knocked airborne they can pummel him while he's stuck in the air.\n\n\nYasuo is a very active matchup for most champions, and there is admittedly a lot you have to keep in mind, but he honestly has a lot of counterplay if you're willing to actually change your playstyle to combat him instead of  just I.E. playing a poke mage like you always would and expecting Yasuo to play at your pace and let you casually harass him.","replies":[{"poster":"P4ppino","date":"2016-07-18T13:25:15.184+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I expected some answers under this post, but I guess you won the argument. :D","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"doombotMECHA","date":"2016-07-18T20:55:51.258+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yas actually does p well vs. ga champions\nbecause, you know, he doesn't have any meaningful resources","replies":[]},{"poster":"SanKakU","date":"2016-07-18T14:05:50.210+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IKR.
