Just be ready to be surprised.\n\nOkay guys, lets play the game of Rito Guess!\n\nHow this game works is that using what a Rioter has given us, we must formulate an idea on what the new champ will be, bonus points to you if you nail it. \n\nWell, lets start!\n\nClue 1: It will NOT be an assassin or support, not surprising seeing as Tahm + Bard were released quite early and brought some interesting things into support. No surprise with nobody wanting another Ekko. This means the positions we have open are: JG, Top, and Mid.\n\nThe last champ before those three was, Rek'Sai, A JG. Now we might be able to scratch her from the list as there are a good amount of JG's but, that can be said for mid and top also, its just that certain popular champs are played frequently.\n\nClue 2: Our latest champs have been quite diverse, we've got a FROG OR A FISH demon from Bilgewater!?, a teenage boy from Zaun that can control time, and a chime collecting thing that helps people.\n\nSo, out of this we can see that we've got: an animal (demon?), a normal human boy, a celestial god or something, and before that a lizard rock void stuff thing-a-ding. This is a pretty big thing to humans ratio, but theres something that makes it unlikely this is going to be a human.\n\nClue 3: Prepare to be surprised, okay, we all know rito has cute little teaser quotes they'll share around that we dont even know was a teaser until the champ preview is released 10 days later. I doubt this is a human as you wouldn't be surprised by something normal being brought to a table, like a piece of bread, you'd be surprised if your family brought out a whopping cake. \n\nSo, i'm gonna go with the whole probably a monster idea as nobody really wants more humans, I mean seriously, who wants to play humans when you could play as a small rat with PTSD that slowly kills people with mushrooms? Personally, I believe this might be that whole \"ROBOT MANATEEEE\" you can spot in all the Creator skins, as that would be quite surprising if it were actually released and not just a joke. \n\nWelp, time to wait a few months to see if my statements were right!","replies":[{"poster":"Toa of Death","date":"2015-08-14T00:11:55.091+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the best place to look for early teasers is the patch notes intro. before Tahm was released, in the PN intro prior they said \"we're always striving to ensure you won't be stuck up the river without a paddle.
