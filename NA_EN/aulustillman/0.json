It happens only during LoL! \r\nDuring the screen freeze I can´t see whats happening, so if I click randomly around during the freeze my charater is walking to the position I clicked (but I \r\ncan´t see where I click because of the freeze...) The freeze is about 2-5 sec long.\r\nThe freez happens mostly during teamfights but sometimes also randomly. This makes the game unplayale for me, because standing still or running blind into the enemy team as an adc doesn´t really win you games.\r\nFirst I thought it is because I have to less fps. I only had around 60 fps. But now I boosted it up to constant 100 fps or more and the screen still freezes.\r\nSo I asked a few of my friends if they have the same problems and alot of them told me they have similar lags since the new client came out.\r\nAfter this information, I activated the low spec mode that you can select in the client - didn´t helped\r\nThan I checked the box in the settings that closes the client as soon as you get ingame - didn´t helped\r\n\r\nI don´t know what to do anymore and I would really apreciate your help. It would also help if you would jsut leave a coment telling me if you have the same problem as I have.\r\n\r\naulustillman","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-07-25T18:24:22.059+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Low spec mode will usually assist with pc stress in the client and not in-game.
