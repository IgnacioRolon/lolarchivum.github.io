Why is it a problem? Well, shooting a low cd long range skill shot with relatively low mana cost is giving Ez tons of gold. \n\nEz, who is  a champion that desperately needs to hit their item spike ahead of the enemy.\n\nEz who hits a brick god damn wall once crit based ADCs match him in items. \n\nSo, Riot is taking away damage scaling on a champion that already scales badly vs his crit based counterparts.  This will probably work just a bit. You&rsquo;ll see his winrate curve move down and  to the left, but it will still be too high before 30 mins.\n\nTrouble is that Ez will absolutely have to take Klepto now to compete.  Eventually when riot wises up and fixes the problem, this will put Ez back where he was before they buffed Q ratio: the dumpster.  He won&rsquo;t even be able to jungle anymore, most likely, since the Q buffs are what helped enable that.\n\nRiot, please just do the right thing here:\n\n**Make Ezreal auto attack to proc Klepto. This forces him to have to actually trade to proc it like any other ADC.**\n\nRemember: Klepto isn&rsquo;t even broken on Gangplank, which seemed like the obvious place it would be broken! Why? It&rsquo;s a point and click spell with much lower range. He can&rsquo;t blind shoot it into your dumb support or adc that doesn&rsquo;t stand behind minions.\n\nI realize this is harder than just lol nerfing a damage ratio due to the way Mystic Shot is coded, but it&rsquo;s what has to be done if you don&rsquo;t want to nerf Kleptomancy directly.","replies":[{"poster":"Chad Chadlainn","date":"2017-11-30T11:34:47.513+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":3,"body":">He won't even be able to jungle anymore\n\nThank goodness.

Meanwhile, everyone else should be just firing an ability then AA'ing to proc Klepto without having to change anything else in their pattern.\n\n~~The delay time might have to be tweaked, as I don't know Ezreal's Q missile speed and max range.~~ Guess it's time to do the math. Ezreal's Q has a missile speed of 2000, and range of 1150. That means when Ezreal shoots a target at max range, the Klepto delay required to prevent his Q from solo triggering the effect is anything more than 0.575s.

Most supports just care about reliably and continually gathering those consumables. In addition (forgot to note this), based on my understanding of how LoL's spaghetti code works a support's AA travel time itself uses up part of that delay time too as the Klepto on-hit effect is proc'ed - wait for it -  when the autoattack hits, NOT when you start the autoattack animation.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Durzaka","date":"2017-11-30T16:53:02.199+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"what?
