He is rather clear that he wants to be able to respond to offenders with more leniency in what constitutes punishment. By not specifying to what degree, he opens it up for discussion. Talked to death? Perhaps, but this entire forum is like leaves rattling in the wind. It's not a single one that gets heard, it's when the whole forest shakes. The sentiment in this thread is becoming more common.\n\nSeems obvious to me; you can't so much as say \"please stop being toxic to our JG\". Well, you *could*, but by merely saying \"stop being toxic\" you'd be putting yourself at risk. That's really not cool. It's clear that the system isn't just punishing the worst 1%- I'm certain because *almost every game I see behavior worse than what some people get banned for here.* Someone makes a mistake that costs dragon? They WILL get burned, almost certainly.\n\nIronically, these flames go higher when someone defends. Trust me, I unashamedly use this fact that people defend aggressively to my advantage. Enemy goes to top lane while everyone else contests dragon, my team gets dragon and 4 kills? \"Nice contribution in top, Syndra\". Sometimes they'll let us know how toxic X is, an open invitation... \"Care to explain, X?\" Then ignore what they say. Often enough, their performance noticeably drops. You know how it goes. Just a little nudge like that is all it takes to set fires in volatile League.\n\nBUT!\n\nThere are better, non-volatile ways to defend against toxicity without putting rifles down and taking up knitting. Humor! Respond back what they said, in your own words! Request a course of action! Take responsibility for failure but acknowledge something positive! DON'T TAKE IT PERSONALLY and DON'T RESPOND IN KIND. It's also effective to do this on someone else's behalf. Understand why the aggressor is acting up, and respond accordingly. Do they seem to feel disrespected? Are they feeling betrayed? Perhaps their expectations aren't being met?\n\nIt doesn't hurt to try once or twice to diffuse a situation by making the right response.\n\nOne other thing- toxic people are getting protections. Words like \"toxic\", \"troll\", \"report\" and others are flagged, I think, by reports. Just as \"you're being hurtful\" should not ever be grounds for punishment, nor should \"you're trolling\" or whatnot. While it's not exemplary to say, it certainly isn't awful, let alone particularly negative. Akin to murderers getting people punished for calling them murderers. So it seems.
