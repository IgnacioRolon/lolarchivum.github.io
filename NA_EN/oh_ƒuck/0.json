I&#039;m not really one to do something like this, but I figured it&#039;d be a great way to reach out for help and tell my story to hopefully help others in the same spot. Please read the whole story to get a full understanding of my situation. Thank you so much. \r\n\r\nLet me start with an intro. My name is Dakota, or Kota, for short. I am currently 20 years old and have been playing League for around 8 years. I started near the end of season 1 and have been playing consistently ever since. I am currently Diamond 4 on NA, but have created a new account to have refreshed MMR for season 9. At the beginning of this upcoming season, I plan on finally putting in enough time to start hard grinding to masters+. \r\n\r\nGrowing up, I always envisioned myself doing something with video games as a full time career, specifically working at the company I so love, Riot Games. I considered being a content creator, designing or working on video games, and even going professional at one point. Obviously as a child everything seems so far away and life quickly showed me otherwise. I was always the kid who thought, &quot;what do I have to do to win the race? How can I get rich quick? What&#039;s the road to fame RIGHT NOW?&quot; And I regret that. \r\n\r\nI was always a huge procrastinator. I considered myself incredibly intelligent, and even know I like to assume I&#039;m pretty smart so to say. However, my lack of determination and my procrastination held me back considerably. I ended up graduating high school with a 2.2 GPA. Luckily for me, I was able to be accepted into the University of Wisconsin Stevens Point after consulting with the admissions counselor ONLY because I had scored a 31 on my ACT. I was given the break I needed to get into college and pursue my life goals only because they trusted me when I said I was ready to change and work harder in school. She had faith in me and that&#039;s all I really needed. \r\n\r\nSo I attended college there. Originally I was studying CS and programming, so as to get a decently high paying job straight out of college. However, I began having real conversations with some of my professors, my german professor specifically. Professor Leek. He had me soon realize that chasing a paycheck is no where near as satisfying or fulfilling as chasing your dreams. He told me that if I know what I want, that I was already blessed and needed to chase it. So I ended up switching majors that semester on the spot. I switched to an Art major to pursue graphic design, because I loved the process and artistic aspect of it. The work was fun, and easy to me. I loved it, but even then something still irked me. My college life was nowhere near exciting to say the least. I have never been the kind of kid to drink or smoke any kind of drugs at all. I never even went to parties. I played football, basketball and tennis in high school. I spent most of my days on campus hanging out with friends playing video games, going to the gym, playing pick up basketball, doing homework or playing tennis. I loved it. I loved everyone I met and befriended. It wasn&#039;t the &quot;life defining&quot; year, but it was a good one. \r\n\r\nOne night, when  I was with my roommate watching a movie, I had massive chest pains spring up out of nowhere. It went on for about 30 minutes before I said anything, even though he could visibly see it was bothersome. I was so worried it was a heart attack because of paranoia. He quickly convinced me to sleep on it and see how I feel in the morning.\r\nSo I did. \r\nI woke up and the pain was faded. It was there, but nowhere near as bad. So I went to classes and had a pretty normal week, but the pain never went away. So I decided to go to the hospital to be safe. I walked to the walk-in(we had one on campus), and asked to be seen. They took x-rays and did the routine stuff, and eventually told me they think it&#039;s nothing more than a sprain or pulled muscle and sent me home. Around 8 hours later, my mother texts me.\r\n&quot;Dakota, I&#039;m coming to pick you up.&quot;\r\n&quot;why??&quot;\r\n&quot;The doctors just called me, they said your lung is collapsed and at risk of ripping more.&quot;\r\nI began panicking but tried my best to stay calm until she got to my campus, and we went to the hospital. They talked me through it and said it&#039;s nothing threatening, but more or less just gonna be a painful heal. It was a 5% collapse, a pneumothorax. Basically a hole had ripped in my lung, causing breathing to hurt. They told me because it&#039;s so small, that I can just go home and do normal things without being physically assertive and I&#039;d be fine. \r\nSo i spent the next week or so in pain, but it soon healed. \r\n\r\nThen the problems got worse. My lungs began continuously collapsing. Over the next 6 months, I had encountered 7 lung collapses, 4 on my right lung and 3 on the left. The doctors had told me that the cause was &quot;spontaneous&quot; and that people with my body type, tall and athletically built, occasionally encounter this kind of issue. Back track to the third collapse. This was the first, and eventually only, one that was big enough to warrant a surgery. They took me in and cut a small hole in my chest. I passed out from the pain so the rest is a blur, but what they did was tape a tube breathing device that would help my lung inflate and deflate. The machine was taped to my chest with a needle going into it, wiring down into my lung, and left there for a week before I had to go in to get it taken out. These collapses were easily the most pain I had ever encountered ever. After the 7th collapse, they had discussed with me the possibility of a full chest tube surgery, where I&#039;d be hospitalized for around a week in order to attempt to fix the issue if it happened again. Luckily it never did.\r\n\r\nHowever, the real problems arose with school.  Because of the collapses, I had been so in and out of the hospital, and barely able to walk that I couldn&#039;t continue going to classes. I emailed teachers and had talked with them about it, but they weren&#039;t very understanding. After the year ended, I received a letter saying I was suspended from the University for a year due to failing freshman year, and my lung issues were not accepted as a medical leave reason because technically I COULD&#039;VE gone to class still, though the pain was too much for me personally to handle. \r\n\r\nI returned to my hometown, and had to find a job and apartment. Due to some family problems, 7 of my cousins needed a home. the mothers of the 7 had both lost parental rights because of drug abuse issues, and my mother did not want to see those kids suffer in foster care because of it. So she took them in. She started housing them and feeding them and raising them and has been since. Since then, one of my aunts has changed her life around and recently gotten parental rights back, so 3 of them moved out. However, the other 4, and my 3 sisters, still live with my mother. So I currently live in an apartment, working part time as a server again, this time at a Texas Roadhouse, with my 6 year old puppy Meaty.\r\n\r\nMoving out quickly had me spending a lot of time alone. The only person I ever really see is my girlfriend, and even then we rarely see eachother due to my work schedule and her school / work schedules conflicting. I thought more about what my german professor had said to me. I wanted to chase my dreams. I began working more and saving money. I became extremely depressed and I&#039;m even still currently trying to fix that. I thought everything was done for. I thought I wouldn&#039;t ever have a chance again, or be given another break. But I&#039;m too damn far in life to give up, and I&#039;m not ready to. Every successful person I&#039;ve asked, has told me something along the lines of: \r\n\r\nIt doesn&#039;t matter what you do for a living at the time. It doesn&#039;t matter if you work at McDonalds, or a factory, or a paper route. What matters is making it, and then after making it, spending any other extra time you have on chasing what you love. Spend that time off work, working on yourself. \r\n\r\nSo what I&#039;ve been doing is attempting to build myself into what I want to be. I&#039;m trying to stream more, I&#039;m trying to improve at league of legends to chase high rank or even Professional play eventually. I&#039;m trying to teach myself every skill I need to do what I want to do, while I can&#039;t participate in school to do so for me. About two weeks ago, I finally bought a decent gaming PC and I am currently teaching myself how to use Photoshop more effectively and how to set up streams, videos etc. \r\n\r\nSee, when I was in that state, I wish someone would&#039;ve told me that. I wish someone would have told me that all that matters is trying because every single damn person on this earth is amazing in their own ways and can be pushed to do incredible things. Every single one of you reading this is capable. Every single one of you can do what you want with life, instead of working that boring ass 9-5. I don&#039;t even have 50 followers on Twitch, but I&#039;m not ready to give up. I&#039;m gonna pursue streaming. I&#039;m going to pursue professional play and self improvement. I&#039;m going to pursue doing everything I once dreamed of as a child because life is precious and nothing should ever be enough to tell you otherwise. Finding support isn&#039;t always the easiest, but it&#039;s damn possible. \r\n\r\nI challenge every single one of you to do something you&#039;ve wanted to since being a child. This isn&#039;t just some &quot;sap story&quot; about me and why you should feel sorry for me. This is me trying to reach out to anyone who was in a similar position as me, and let them know that it&#039;s doable. Everything you dreamed of is doable and you should never give up on those dreams. If you work 8 hours a day, spend another 8 working on YOU after that.\r\n\r\nThe phrase I&#039;ve come up with for that is;\r\nWork a job to support you while working a hobby to fulfill you. \r\n\r\nFor anyone curious, my twitch link is linked above and I will be streaming almost daily starting in November. It&#039;s a long road, but I believe I can get there. If anyone is able to provide any other form of help please leave a comment with discord or league name so we can talk. Any kind of help, whether it be exposure, advice or even the ability to teach me more about graphic design / editing, would be appreciated, but is not expected. I would love to hear everyone&#039;s personal stories as well. I&#039;m always here to talk or help.\r\n\r\nAnd anyone out there who still worries, please remember. You can too. \r\nTell your story and let it be heard. Tell everyone what you were, what you are, and what you&#039;re going to be. Make it a reality, please. It&#039;s the least you can do for yourself.","replies":[]}
