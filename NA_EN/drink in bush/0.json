Your ban is not based on anyone's behavior but your own, and you are only held accountable for what you said.\n\nToxic is toxic, nobody cares who you were directing it at.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Prandine","date":"2016-08-29T19:05:30.808+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=drink in bush,realm=OCE,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=BJh0JVtW,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2016-08-29T09:40:32.579+0000)\n>\n> im only toxic towards player who are toxic, why arnt they banned?\n\nSomeone else acting up doesn't mean that you get a free pass to act up as well. Those other people most likely have been punished before and are just hoping to take you down with them. From [Understanding the Tribunal](http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=2726400): \n\n>**4) That player in my game was far worse than me. Why am I banned???**\na) I'll keep this one simple: retaliation isn't OK. Reacting to a toxic player by being toxic just incites that player to be even worse--it also ruins the game for up to 8 other players. It is far, far worse to watch two people yelling at each other all game than it is to watch 1 player ranting into blank space. Almost everyone in the game can find someone out there that behaves worse than they do--but so what? Finding someone worse doesn't justify your behavior or justify retaliation. We expect more out of our players. What players often don't realize is... those other players in your game that you thought were worse? Nearly 100% of the time, those players were banned even before you were. If someone is being toxic, just report them and move on. If you retaliate, both of you will be banned. It's really that simple.\n\nAs far as your ban is concerned, since you most likely have already received at least 35-games worth of chat restrictions and a 2-week ban, the next step up was a permaban. If you really had just gotten off of a 2-week ban then we can only assume that you still chose to be a jerk to other people, hence why you got another punishment. If you wish to discuss your ban then post your entire unedited Reform Card in your thread.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BlueThingamajig","date":"2016-08-29T13:35:03.873+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"> i snapped back at them assuming because they flamed me i can return the favour\n\nWell, here's an educational moment.

Right now it's a complete shitstorm. Players can spam their team, harrass them, call them Ngggg and other stuff, even start intentionally feeding once you mute them, and yet riot will give you a punishment when you finally had enough and tell em to F off. it's quite sad how instant feedback isn't instant any more. I just had a match where I was harrassed because I'm just doing arams to work off a chat restriction I got because I had finally had enough of an intentional feeder who was calling me a ngg etc before I muted him and during the post game and yet, are these players who keep harrassing delt with?
