Their passives are extremely similar.\r\n\r\nDiana&#039;s passive says that on every third basic attack her Moonsilver Blade adds additional, AOE magic damage to the attack. Ekko&#039;s is on every third basic attack he steals/gains attack speed and deals additional magic damage.\r\n\r\nCurrently upon using basic attacks there is nothing keeping track of Ekko&#039;s like there is for Diana&#039;s. Perhaps adding a counter so he can follow-up more optimally with Sheen procs?\r\n\r\n**Suggestion:** _Give Ekko&#039;s passive a &quot;stack&quot; counter that appears keep track of his basic attacks like Diana._","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2015-05-19T17:49:52.468+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ekko's passive builds up stacks on his target, rather than on himself. As a result there's a stack icon, plus visual effect, on whoever he's hitting, since a stack icon on Ekko himself's got the potential to be pretty misleading when he's got stacks on multiple targets.","replies":[{"poster":"aaronautumn","date":"2015-05-19T17:52:48.743+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"what if you have a small champ portrait(of each enemy)+number of stacks on ekko's bar?","replies":[{"poster":"Vistha Kai","date":"2015-05-19T18:03:03.964+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:150}} {{champion:67}} {{champion:254}} {{item:3071}}","replies":[{"poster":"aaronautumn","date":"2015-05-19T18:11:34.344+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"idk what that means","replies":[{"poster":"R110","date":"2015-05-19T18:14:41.647+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"He/She means that it looks similar to the stacks from Gnar, Vayne and Vi with the circles.","replies":[{"poster":"aaronautumn","date":"2015-05-19T18:15:59.392+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ok that makes sense now","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2015-05-20T01:16:36.655+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Whenever we add in a new visual element to communicate something more clearly it comes at a cost to clarity for other effects. In this case adding a lot of extra buff icons makes it harder for players, both Ekko and his allies/enemies, to track other buffs and debuffs on him. Since the debuff particles on targets affected by Ekko's passive are the primary means of passive tracking we didn't feel the benefits of adding individual tracking buffs to him as well outweighed the cost.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Power Plant","date":"2015-05-19T18:09:37.455+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay, so it shows up, it just shows up on the enemy champion. Just curious, but why does it only apply to individuals instead of counting total # of hits? Because that'd be another decent way to work it without having to reset his stacks all the time. Like Aaronautumn said, like a champ portrait with the # of stacks, that would be nice too. It's pretty convoluted to have to go from enemy to enemy to find out where your stacks are!","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2015-05-20T01:19:32.987+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"One of our goals with Ekko was to try and make an assassin with longer combat times and, in exchange, more utility. Allowing him to pre prime his passive on other targets and then trigger it immediately on someone else clashes with that goal. \n\nAs a more general point it sounds like you're having a lot of trouble tracking Ekko's stacks. Is the visual effect (rings around the target's feet) not showing up for you, something you find's hard to spot, not in a natural place you'd expect or a similar sort of issue?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mouse534","date":"2015-05-19T21:05:55.833+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"From what I have seen on the pbe and on the youtubes is that his q also procs his passive, not just his autos. So counting his autos does not cut it alone, this would make it easier to read after throwing your q to figure out who has 2 stacks for his auto attack/blink ability. It is not that hard to read from what I have seen, but what is hard to keep track of (from what I have seen) is his clones that he produces and the speed of his stun field/shield. He seems to be a mix of Vayne and Diana, I hope that helps! :D","replies":[]}]}]}]}
