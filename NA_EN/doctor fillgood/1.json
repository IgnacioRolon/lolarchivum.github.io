From such a great monolith to the shell of what Riot once was.  People get away with doing what they want.  Ruining people&#039;s games, trolling, whatever they want...you do a ban or a temp ban...they continue...worst case scenario they just make a new account.\r\n\r\nThere is no meaningful punishment, especially for people ruining other people&#039;s games in your ranked system.  You&#039;ll sure as hell take action for your highest ranked people, and for people making you money.  Not those of us that support by buying skin, but by e-sports crap.\r\n\r\nI expect to either be completely ignored, as per the norm it seems, as I&#039;ve pleaded for help already...or possibly punished...at least then I&#039;d know you read the damn thing.  At least you would have answered, but then to prove my point right anyway.\r\n\r\nYou seem to have stopped giving a damn about the quality of anything less then high rank now.  You&#039;ve taken a new direction in posting what you want to so that people are appeased and don&#039;t claim you to ignore us, but personally, and I know I&#039;m not the only one, I think it&#039;s pretty crappy that we&#039;re stuck dealing with the sheer amount of bullshit we have to just to try to enjoy the game.   I for one am already looking for a new MOBA since it seems like it&#039;s acceptable for the community to be as terrible as it is, both by you and by most of the community.\r\n\r\nIf there&#039;s a shining light anywhere in the future, please share it with us...if you plan on continuing to allow the refuse to pile up then just ignore us some more.  I doubt I&#039;ll be the only one to leave, but I doubt it&#039;ll matter much either.  Hopefully the community doesn&#039;t just slam me for this and actually see&#039;s that I&#039;m not just bitching, I&#039;m pointing out flaws that need to be addressed which, unfortunately, start with both Riot and the Community.  It&#039;s obvious the community isn&#039;t going to fix itself, so it falls to Riot.\r\n\r\nI hope something changes, but I&#039;ve had hope before.  This isn&#039;t the first game that has gone this route.","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-02-22T12:50:59.323+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"After reading your entire post, I don't think I understand what your exact issue is. \n\nIs it that riot balances for high levels of play?

Let's start there for ruining people's games? At lower elo it's terrible BECAUSE of the sheer amount of garbage that we have to deal with.  I would honestly wager a good amount of people stuck in bronze probably don't belong here.  I'm not saying all, nor am I saying I'm some kind of challenger level super player, I'm saying a lot of us are here just because of the sheer amount of people intentionally screwing our games over.  Or horrible match ups in some cases, but that's another issue that isn't really solvable as long as boosting is a thing and smurf accounts are a thing.  Doesn't really matter what I throw out there, at the end of the day it should be Riot's job to ensure some degree of quality on their game.  They've made a complete shift from Gaming Company to Business and even in Business 101 crapping on a large amount of your customers and not giving a damn is horrible practice.  If they DO give a damn, they don't take a whole lot of effort to show it.  Even coming on a post similar to this and saying \"Hey, we read it.\"  That wold at least show people they're present and giving a damn (or at least pretending to.)  I have no issues with what they do in LCS and whatnot, I have no issue with their insane idea of balance, because if we're being serious they kind of throw that idea out the window hard.  What I have an issue with is the allows of the stupid crap below their high level play.  The idea of leaning so much in one direction that it screws other areas.  That's my issue and what I feel is a design flaw...so that being entirely aside and admissible because everyone has their own opinions and even attempting to logically explain my opinion and WHY I think the way I do, I'll be flamed more then reasoned with.  Anyway, TLDR after the rant; I'd like to see the lower cess pool playable and enjoyable again, not just wondering who has less trolls so we can figure out who wins.","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-02-23T11:09:19.414+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wouldn't say I was playing with someone who was trolling in a long time, and only a few verbally toxic people.
