Being stoned/drunk is no excuse to be a burden.  'Relax its normals so I don't wanna give a shit' is no excuse to be a burden.

There's a few exceptions I can think of (e.g. potential pro prospects, Bronze/Silver/Gold rewards boundary), but there isn't much difference otherwise. If you're grinding in ranked, you're probably doing it for either bragging rights or to test your own abilities. Both of those reasons are just as applicable to any other (permanent) game mode and aren't exclusive to ranked. Similarly, you're \"only losing time\" in ranked as well, since you can make up for it by playing more games.\n\nI don't think being impaired or \"it's just <x\" are quite worth punishment by themselves, but they'd absolutely be a tipping point between \"just questionable\" and \"reportable.\"\n\nSide note:  it seems significantly more selfish to ruin a game for up to nine other people than to punish that one dude who maybe had a bad week.","replies":[{"poster":"Sexy Fish Nami","date":"2017-12-18T03:14:19.087+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":4,"body":"Up to 9 people.\n\nYou are not ruining the game for the enemy team, as a matter of facts, they might actually be laughing.

You can go with the argument that it feels like you're wasting your time because of him, but who says that you wouldn't of gotten a teammates whos having an unlucky game and is feeding? Second of all, you're assuming that having someone who is drunk is an insta lose because they intentionally feed or something, clearly, you haven't played with someone who is drunk. \n\nThey are going to most likely make some bad plays, but that doesn't mean they are going to intentionally feed and not do some good plays here and there.\n\nUnderstand what I mean for value, in normals, theres no LP, in ranks, theres LP.

It'd be like excusing a guy spouting racial slurs while puking on the bus because \"who says someone else wouldn't have been trying to punch you?\" Considering what you might have gotten instead is a completely irrelevant discussion.\n\nFurthermore, at what point did I say anything about insta-losing?\n\nAs for ranks and values, every PvP game mode has MMR, and every single game mode has numbers. The value of all of these things is completely subjective, since it has a different meaning to each player. Maybe Alice is ecstatic she finally hit Plat. Maybe Bob is anxious that he's only Plat. Maybe Carol doesn't care about being Plat and just wants to be +300 in ARAM.

This game mode is called ranked. \n\nSo its also fair to have the assumption that not everyone goes in normals with the expectation of wanting a challenge. \n\nBecause someone wants the game to be played a particular way does not mean that everyone should go with it. Some people play normals for fun, you should accept that. Some people plays normals for competition, which I dont understand, and thats also fine and should be accepted. As I say to people, as long as you try, im happy with that. Nobody should be punished because they are having fun in a non competitive environment as long as they are trying. If this individual in question is actually just doing everything he can to fuck over the game over and over again, then yes, punish him.\n\nHowever, if someone who is drunk is trying to play the game and win but is just too affected by the alcohol, thats in my opinion fine as long as its a non competitive environment.","replies":[{"poster":"Minarde","date":"2017-12-18T22:30:49.746+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wait, so if I'm understanding your argument, we've been arguing roughly the same point.\n\nSome people are looking for fun; other people are looking for competition.

I may not personally consider a particular mode competitive, but I can certainly understand that someone else might. Maybe they really enjoy that mode, and maybe ranked simply isn't offered as an option for that mode. Likewise, competitive players should understand that some players might be more casual in their approach. Either way, it's just common courtesy to compromise between competitive and casual.\n\nThat's why \"high af lmao\" or \"lol its just <X>\" is so irritating.

(You'll never be able to make team mates better, only you)\n\nLet's talk about itemization, and I'll try to be unbiased towards zoe support.\n\nI see that you took Coin, which is kind of a toss up for me between spellthief and coin, but really I don't personally have an issue with Coin, but I feel that maybe with the amount of mobility they have (Mainly lucian) the active of frostqueen would be better. Thats just a theory tho I'm willing to waver on that one.\n\nBut the second issue I see, and its the biggest issue. \n\nThe Swifties.\n\nSwifties got nerfed to shit a while back, so them alone aren't even that good, but you have to look at what you're going up against.\n\nYou have slow reset boots against a team with very little slows.\n\nXayah has a root\nRek has a knockup\nTF has a stun\nLux has a root (and a slow)\nand lucian has a slow (I think its a slow)\n\nSo buying a nerfed item in a sub optimal spot puts you even further behind by honestly just making you less of a threat.\n\n{{item:3117}} is generally the best bet for most aggro supports, since having that increased mobility allows you to reposition better, faster, and more aggressively. And since none of Zoe's abilities go through minions, repositioning is very important.\n\nLux's slow is a pain to deal with, but if you play around its cool down the bonus ms from mobis which procs within 5 seconds, allows you to counter attack lux soon after while her slow is still on cd, greatly lowering her kill potential.\n\nAlso a benefit to mobis is roaming. If you're confident in your zoe play roaming up to mid and tkaing a chunk out of the mid laner will defintely help your team.\n\nThe other thing im seeing you build is a zzrot, which I really really don't agree with. The mr and armor is good, and the lane pushing is good too, but you would vastly benefit more from building some ap or even utilty item like solari if you absolutely must protect your adc and team from burst damage.\n\nI guess you're going for the spell book zzrot push thing, but really that doesn't work well with zoe because you're missing out on her core strength, nuking people. I would take either Aery or Arcane comet, and possibly domination or inspiration as the secondary, because I feel like you're missing out on a ton of potential damage that you could be dealing, and you could be a mmmmuuuuuch bigger threat.\n\nI also see you're maxing your E, which lets look into that (its not right btw)\n\nPaddlestar (Q) scales off of AP and your Level.\nYour E only scales off of AP.\n\nSo basically when you max your E (so you'd have 3 points in e by level 6).\n\nThe CD on Q with no runes or anything, at rank 3 is 6 seconds, and deals minimum of a total of 250. Thats the minimum, and you can cast 2 Q's in the span of time it takes your E to come off of cd.\n\nE at rank three will at msot give you a bonus of 280, and thats if you land it. if you throw it and miss it the enemy has a 15 second window to eat your ass.\n\nWith maxing Q you not only do more potential damage when you do land an E, you're able to throw it out more often, meaning your overall dps is higher, and you're a bigger threat with your harass, esp since you can bend it around minions if you have the mechanics.\n\n\n\nJust sum thoughts","replies":[{"poster":"Doctor Fillgood","date":"2017-12-18T03:50:58.125+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I tried zoe out because I had a basic understanding of her kit and the quest.

I don't like ranked.  I don't play ranked.  It amplifies the toxic BS of the game tenfold, I've found and I just don't care about climbing or for the stress ranked brings.  I do however, not enjoy games where three people are trying to win while one or two people wander around aimlessly doing stupid crap and not trying at all.  Now I'm all for off-meta stuff in normals... that's fine.  Duo mages bot?  Sure.  Top lane Twitch?  Whatever.  Jungle Taric?  I'd love to see that work.  But play the damned game to win!  You don't need to look up the top winrate build for the top winrate champ and play nothing but that... but whatever you pick, play it as best you can, and play the game to win.  Don't run off to chase kills instead of pushing an objective.  Don't B after an ace when there's something else you could get done.  Don't head off to farm wolves when your team is doing baron.  Don't mindlessly splitpush a lane all game and refuse to group.  (Unless you're Singed or Tryndamere, I guess) \n\nFor me the game is never more frustrating than when it's lost not because of skill but because of stupidity.  Because someone decided to go full derp and threw the game.  \"Don't take it seriously\" is the excuse of people who KNOW they messed up and want to dismiss it.  No one plays the game to lose it except trolls... and by not giving a shit or even INTENTIONALLY doing something stupid over a better, smarter play you are being a troll.  \n\nNow obviously, what is the best course of action in a LOT of places is a matter of opinion.  Maybe you win a teamfight mid and half the team wants to baron while the other half starts trying to shove mid towers.  Which is better?  That's situational.  Maybe you got a pick but still feel you'd lose a 4v5 and your team wants to go in and try to fight that fed vayne while you'd rather quietly grab an objective or try to gain vision control while they're poorly set up to fight you.  This isn't troll behavior.  What actually IS troll behavior is usually only very obvious to the people in the game, and the stupid bot that handles reports will NEVER realize it.  \n\nThere wasn't a point to this rant.  I just kinda felt like putting it out there.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gelmous","date":"2017-12-18T13:44:43.947+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"if you're high or drunk and want to have a chill game play vs bots and please don't ruin my game","replies":[]},{"poster":"Auroramancer","date":"2017-12-18T21:53:21.615+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"No. \n\nWhile I don't play drunk/high, I don't want to feel the need to tryhard in normals.

I could argue. I could flame back. I could even mute too, but I think even upset teammates can still have valuable input later on in the game. But that's the crux of this.
