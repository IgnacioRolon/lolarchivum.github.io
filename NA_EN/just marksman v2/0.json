Other gemstone skins are obtainable through rerolling, but the regular Pax Sivir was a limited skin which are *not* available through rerolling. \n\nThis brings us to a dilemma....we haven't actually stated just yet whether she is a Limited or Mythic skin as far as I know. It does seem like she will be labeled as a Limited Skin as well this time, but I'll be sure to reach back out once I have a definitive answer!","replies":[{"poster":"Chromatic Eagle","date":"2017-08-12T12:43:34.565+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What's a mythic skin?\n\nHow much money do I need to spend to get 10 gemstones?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-13T00:04:44.231+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mythic skins are those that are only obtainable through gemstones.

I also have an idle Soulstealer Vayne shard, while also owning her skin. According to this logic, I would assume that yes, if she's available to purchase with gems, she can also be rolled with skin shards. However, I won't really know for sure until she becomes available. At which, I will either get a perm skin shard for a skin I already own, or I will receive the Neo Pax Sivir skin. However, being that she's going to be available only for a limited time, there's the possibility that she could be an exception, in which case, I'm prepared to get her the old fashion way through gemstones. I hope it's obtainable rolling skin shards, just so I can hold on to my pretty little gemstones a bit longer.\n\nAfter I checked back in my loot tab, I noticed \"Exclusive Lancer Zero Hecarim Skin\" still available for purchase for 10 gems after rolling lancer with shards... are they any different?\n\nTo update this post, it now shows \"Exclusive Lancer Zero Hecarim Skin\" as owned, and no longer available for purchase for 10 gems, without needing to purchase it after rolling it with shards.","replies":[]}]}
