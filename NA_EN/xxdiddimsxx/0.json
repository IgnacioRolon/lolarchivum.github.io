Every single champion that doesn't have to sacrifice mana or energy to use abilities is INSANELY strong. Namely, garen, kat, yas, trynd, renekton, riven, rengar, kled. the list goes on.\r\nThe problem with this is that these champions can poke the entire laning phase with literally no downside, they dont lose hp or energy or mana, they simply poke until you die, in some cases the GAIN more from attacking you, looking at you trynd >:(\r\nanyway i think that this is unfair to champs that use mana because most of the time they need to buy mana items\r\nThis is just my opinion but i feel strongly about it","replies":[{"poster":"nelogis","date":"2019-02-28T10:53:14.394+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Literally the only insanely strong champ in your \"insanely strong\" champ list is Riven\n\nevery other champ is good at best on that list ranging down to straight up bad picks like Tryndamere at the moment","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-02-28T00:10:26.325+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"> rengar\n\n> the entire laning phase\n\nOof.\n\nThey tend to not be overly strong so much as overly annoying.\n\nAt really low ranks, they can be oppressive - the lack of resource management lets them bully out poor laners with bad resource management or positioning.","replies":[{"poster":"xXDiddimsXx","date":"2019-03-04T00:52:49.461+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah im only silver so i deal with these kind of champions every game","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Daddy Ants","date":"2019-02-28T12:11:04.451+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Any mage + {{item:3802}} = basically a ranged version of those champs.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Saezio","date":"2019-02-28T11:32:15.841+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riven is strong, yasuo is I would say A tier but not S tier.

Most of them see 0 presence in pro games. All relatively objective metrics we have suggest that there is no systemic problem with mana-less champs.\n\nA good tip when you find something OP is to try and play it yourself. It helps you understand their weaknesses and how to beat them, seeing things from the other side.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SÃµna","date":"2019-02-28T14:06:13.755+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"those champions are for the competitive views, they create profits to Riot, so they have more money to create gorgeous skins for us","replies":[]},{"poster":"ZXImmortal","date":"2019-02-28T12:50:33.586+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Trynd sucks balls the only no mana champ thats bas is vlad","replies":[]},{"poster":"Warlord Rhinark","date":"2019-02-28T11:21:26.429+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Give them Energy bars.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AlienPrimate","date":"2019-02-28T04:26:32.329+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The reason champions with mana have mana is that they would be too strong without the limitations of mana.  Mana is actually stronger than energy once mana problems are situated either through items or just base mana scaling.  Energy champions can only combo once and then they have to back out until they are replenished while mana champions can spam non stop for a minute straight come late game.  You just need to learn how to manage mana early game and it can become a powerful tool once it is built up.\n\nAll of the champions you listed have clear weaknesses (except maybe Yasuo who is more curbed by the player's own skill level).  Anyone with any kind of mobility can dance in circles around Garen.  Kat gets stunned once and she is dead.  Tryndamere is practically useless in team fights so he is forced to split push to be of use to his team.  Renekton is absolute trash if he doesn't get fed.  Literally all you have to do to win lane against him is sit under your tower and give him a cs lead.  Riven can easily be counter engaged as soon as she uses her 3rd Q and her health regen is basically nothing meaning even if you lose the short trade you can still outsustain in the long run.  Someone else mentioned Shyvana who isn't even a champion unless she has her ult.","replies":[]}]}
