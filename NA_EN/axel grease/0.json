Since I was intending to buy the Harrowing skin for her, I tried to select it in the skin select during the pre-game countdown, but didn&#039;t see it. I clicked the &quot;buy skin&quot; button on another skin, then navigated to the Harrowing skin and bought it. However, it wouldn&#039;t let me select the skin for that game even after I had purchased it.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-11-10T18:19:37.994+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Axel Grease,\n\nThanks for the report!
