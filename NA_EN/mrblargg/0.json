I had to reconnect 5 times in order to get into the game. This also happened last night but I was not able to reconnect at all. There is a message about disconnecting that appears with an 'OK' prompt which I will include in the post if this happens again. I do not believe it to be an issue on my side as I have tried restarting my router as well as my computer to no avail.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-10T22:51:59.204+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This can sometimes happen when your network/ISP is having problems getting a solid signal with the game server (you need to make a new connection to a different server once the game starts). \n\nTypically this is easy enough to fix up though, so check out our [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) for the steps on Port Forwarding and how to configure your DNS settings. They tend to have the best luck fixing these connection issues, but if not go ahead and do the other steps juuuuust in case the problem lies in there. Test this in a custom game first to avoid any penalties!","replies":[]}]}
