This is still a thing called being responsible and it is a thing that adults do.\r\n3) companies that let themselves get bodied by feelings don&#039;t survive. Instead, set standards, make them public, and stick to them. This happens to be an aspect of responsibility which adults do.\r\n4) you can&#039;t allow immature people to destroy a culture of dialogue, reason, and responsibility by virtue of their uncontrolled feelings.\r\n\r\nNot only do I not expect anyone to reply here, but I won&#039;t be back to check anyway, so... I encourage you to not waste your time.\r\n\r\nThanks for the years of fun.  Sad to see them end.","replies":[]}
