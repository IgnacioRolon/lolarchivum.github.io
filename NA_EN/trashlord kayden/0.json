The login error you were having is an issue we've been tracking, and seems to be caused by a patch mismatch.  Per the [sticky](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/Oe3XBf34-incorrect-username-or-password), restarting your client should get you to the current patch otherwise the manual steps can help too.  \n\nThere may be a more serious problem though, if this all started with a bugsplat.  This can be caused by bad drivers, hardware, or game files.  My suggestion would be to go through each step of the [game crash](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes+) guide just to make sure everything is okay.\n\nTo be honest, it's unlikely that we can recover your LP.  Doing so could cause issues with the ladder system and matchmaking service, but you can hit us up in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) just in case.  I can't make any guarantees, though.  Hope all that helps clear things up, and helps!","replies":[{"poster":"Trashlord Kayden","date":"2017-05-24T18:47:59.750+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i waited a full 12 hours as i heard others were having the same issue. i had to launch the full client repair to get it to reset. and thankyou so much for the response, it helps immensely.","replies":[]}]}]}
