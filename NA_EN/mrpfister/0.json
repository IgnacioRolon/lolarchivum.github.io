I've played my fair share of normal blind pick and normal draft. I've played a decent amount of oddball lanes and did well/had fun. Having fun and playing off kilter stuff is what normals are good for... im not gonna pick weird shit in Ranked, but i will in normals. Thats all he wants, a place where he can pick his champ, and have people accept it.\n\nAlso a place where you can pick Jinx and get it 100% and be only adc.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"MrPfister","date":"2016-01-14T23:07:56.066+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Where did I say I didn't respect my team or try my hardest.

Further, even if it does make getting a game take a little bit longer, that is better than having to endure 40 minute game where someone else decides to insta lock the role/lane you already called then proceeds to abuse, feed, rage at you before afk'ing etc.\n\nAlso consider; by allowing people to pre-pick two possible rolls, it doesn't prohibit them from still doing silly builds or off meta champ picks. And if wait times are too much to handle, then that will encourage more people to play those roles, as they will get games much faster. Rito could always strap on some bonus chance of getting crafting mats or ip that could be adjusted dynamically to encourage more people to fill less popular roles/or try roles they don't normally use aswell. I think it would go a long way to making the community much less toxic in general.","replies":[]},{"poster":"killferd","date":"2016-01-15T12:50:19.701+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"damm straight mate.\nwith you on that.\ndon't force rank drama on normals PLEASE.\nit's like riot only wants competitive play in mind...to hell with others.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2016-01-15T17:42:42.181+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Then wait for the blind pick champ select and you'll get most of what you want.","replies":[]}]}
