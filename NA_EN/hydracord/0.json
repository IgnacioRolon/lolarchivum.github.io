The red ban button didn't show up and Malzahar's symbol had a small loading circle on top of it.

In the meantime, just in general it sounds like you might be having network problems, so a poor connection can cause you to lose sync in champion select.  Personally, I'd suggest using the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to get that fixed up.  Make sure to select Mac for instructions specific to your OS.  Hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
