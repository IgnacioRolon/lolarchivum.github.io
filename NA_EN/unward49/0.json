For one thing, they're RNG dependent. Certain comps fit certain dragons better. A 1-3-1 comp would benefit greatly from the mountain dragon, a siege poke comp would benefit from the water dragon, and a hard engage dive comp benefits greatly from the fire dragon (fuck the air dragon tbh, it's easily the weakest dragon since its buff has no effect in combat like the others). Of the dragons, water and fire are pretty obviously the strongest. Water's sustain makes it very hard for your laners to lose their lanes due to the sustain, and the fire dragon is bizarrely overpowered, since not only does it increase champion's abilities to fight each other, but it also increases their ability to kill turrets and epic monsters... which is all the mountain drake buff does. This makes the fire dragon pretty unarguably better than the mountain drake.\n\nBecause of the poor balancing between each dragon, RNG can fuck your ability to comeback. If you're behind, mountain drake doesn't have nearly as much value as it does for the team that's ahead, and air dragon is lol. \n\nThe new dragon system is definitely cooler, but honestly? I think it's anathema to game health.","replies":[{"poster":"Unward49","date":"2016-05-07T23:51:22.142+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Memeglaive Garen,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=TIhitN6c,comment-id=0006,timestamp=2016-05-07T23:44:05.965+0000)\n>\n> Of the dragons, water and fire are pretty obviously the strongest.
