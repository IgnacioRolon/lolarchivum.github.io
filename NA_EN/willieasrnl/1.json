You are completely new, playing with either new or previously banned players.\n\nBy the time you get out of the extended tutorial period, most of them will be banned or in dumpster elo. If someone flames, ignore and report. You may not get a notification, but they are almost always restricted or banned.","replies":[{"poster":"AlienPrimate","date":"2019-11-03T16:45:49.835+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They are not playing with new or previously banned players which is the problem.  I looked through their match history and they have exclusively plat-grandmaster in their games (yes, one game had grandmaster).  They should be in dumpster elo but the mmr system is not lowering or taking way too long to lower.  As to how the mmr got that high in the first place is another question entirely.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"WillieaSrNl","date":"2019-11-02T23:09:14.400+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"yet another game where im flamed constantly for playing badly, why are the players on this game like this? its really upsetting.","replies":[{"poster":"Ambitious Minnow","date":"2019-11-03T16:27:56.759+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because matchmaking is savagely bad aha Riot had not listened to pleas from players.

Is there an chat command where i can chat-mute all players without ping-mute them?\n\nIf I type \"mute all\" or \"ignore all\" i also ping-mute them -.-\n\nYes, yes I know there is a toggle in Interface where you can disable chat, but sometimes there are games where I need to talk to my team and I don't want to go to interface everytime in the middle of the game.","replies":[]}]}
