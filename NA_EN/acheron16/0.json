Could this possibly be a bug where some punishments aren't being properly reported to Riot servers? I feel like this may be worth looking into.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-22T20:43:53.930+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's more likely that the punishment had already been played through (for LPQ's) or that they were talking about a different account.
