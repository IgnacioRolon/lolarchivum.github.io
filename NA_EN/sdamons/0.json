If you look into my previous chats from the IP i logged in from in my city that I can provide for you, you'll notice that I do not speak that way. My account was compromised and It feels really unfair that I've been banned for it. if there is any way I can go through some sort of process to prove I did not do what i was banned for, I would be super happy. I invested a lot of  time and money into this account and I really don't want to lose it.","replies":[{"poster":"Keyru","date":"2017-09-12T22:43:05.292+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey SDamonS!\n\nJust as A Bagelle has stated, you can write in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).
