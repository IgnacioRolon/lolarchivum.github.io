(Level 10 vs Level 8)\nonly there is one option, farm  all jungle then gank, it works only if your champ scales hard, that is {{champion:11}} \nif you want carry games just go in lanes, you can farm well and still get super fed easily .\nif you ever get a team , and you want to play in tournaments, clash or ... , your team dont accept that you are the person who carries the game, it never happens.\ndo you want know what role is being changed all years ? each year it is jungle, you are being changed, should game last longer ? take xp from jungle, make jungle harder, force junglers to fight , do you want have more laning phase ? what you want to do in games ? lanes are always the same, it is jungle that get changed to balance game. \n\nif you are deciding for a maining role, never think to jungle, i played 2 years until get it, so you don't. peace\n","replies":[]}
