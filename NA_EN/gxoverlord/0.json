Look riot i understand the whole use of punishment (which is pretty fucked that you punish your players) is good for rooting out bad experiences, but literally having to experience missing out on a game with your friends, not being allowed to play for  30 MINUTES!!!! for missing something you give someone only a few second to do is so unfair it made me so sososososososoososososoosososososooso fucking pised for the THIRD TIME TODAY!!!!!!!!!!! Literally this punishment is so wrong so obnoxious such a ridiculous punishment that it makes me want to just complain to every single person about how terrible league is now because they treat their players like garbage because they deny you access to the game for hours when you dont do exactly what they want when they want it. Honestly its just like this now and its so cruel and makes for a terrible average day of experience in the game now i dont think ive ever gone a week without experiencing some sort of bullshit que timeout like this and yeah maybe actions where deserving of &quot;punishment&quot;(why you punish your players is fucked anyway) the &quot;punishment&quot; of 30 MINUTES IS FUCKING RIDICULOUS. I sit down get the chance to play one game today then answer the call for 5 seconds BOOM  no game anymore because i dont have time to waste 30 minutes of my life to sit here and wait for you to let me back into the game Im sick of this shit league was never this way in the past in the past you would ban people for real stuff, now you want to ban us for scratching our ass. I&#039;m literally done whoever else wants to see a decrease in the INSANE que punishment times please comment respond share!!!!!!!!!","replies":[{"poster":"Wr√Üth","date":"2016-07-09T13:22:21.731+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok, bye \nhttps://media.giphy.com/media/12CtkDlw4QVnWw/giphy.gif","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gibberwatt","date":"2016-07-09T13:12:02.672+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I dunno about you, but If I miss the afk check, I can just go back in and get into the que again immediatly.

Just pay attention to the screen. I've gone through hours and hours of low priority queue and queue dodge penalty. Its a good system as it obviously discourages you to leave.","replies":[]}]}
