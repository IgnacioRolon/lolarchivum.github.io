I had some issues getting the patcher to open, but I ran it as an admin and it worked after that. It downloaded pretty fast at 1000 KBps, it got stuck, I copied a file into a different folder, and then it finished. It launched fine, I logged in fine, everything was loaded, I had access to everything. Then I decided to test run into a custom game and immediately after champ select, the window minimized as normal, but then nothing happened. There was no loading screen. The client just said that the game had crashed and I could try to reconnect, but that didn't work. I logged out and tried re-opening it, but instead it alternated between not responding and closing, bug splat, and opening but then telling me that it had detected corrupt files and prompting me to repair it. I am currently repairing it, but now its going at 100 KBps, so I decided I would see if there are any suggestions while I am waiting.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-11T22:48:54.556+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not sure what you mean by copying to another folder, but it's really important that the patcher downloads assets and writes them in the intended locations.  Otherwise, it will fail to find what it's looking for and certainly result in a bugsplat.  I'd like to help, but as a general rule of thumb I advise against modifying, deleting, or moving around files.  \n\nRunning as admin can be a temporary solution, but keep in mind that you might have security settings blocking other features like getting the game to launch.  I can't pinpoint what's happening exactly now with the changes made so far.  Hopefully, the repair here will do the trick.  Let me know if you have any issues afterwards, and I'm happy to help from that point!","replies":[{"poster":"okihustat","date":"2016-10-11T23:06:18.855+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"The file I copied was off of this \nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/dypvwGTN-people-whos-patches-get-stuck-at-33-87-or-whatever-come-here\nI just made sure to allow LoL and the patcher on my security settings","replies":[]}]}]}
