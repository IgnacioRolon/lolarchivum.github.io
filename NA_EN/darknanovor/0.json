Following most of these events being brought to light recently, when they have been for a problem a long time before it was brought to the public eye, we can deduce that the core of the problem is not a simple item or a champion...**it&#039;s the Rioters themselves** as harsh as it sounds. Truth is, if we want league to last much longer and envision a great FUTURE (yes i know, a word this band-aid short-term solution company is not familiar with) for the game there needs to be something done about the company itself. Unfortunately, even the very few respectable Rioters that actually want to make this game enjoyable again gets silenced by the big ego man-children at the top of the company, thanks to their stubbornness and immaturity. \n\n**The Solution?**\n\n_A company reform._ To put it simply, there needs to be people fired in the company and replaced. Who specifically needs to be fired? The regressive, unopened to constructive high elo experienced feedback, immature man-children that farts on other employers faces, wear \"just the tip\" shirts and refuse to change their ways because &quot;muh frat mentality&quot;. This is  a business not a high school and it&#039;s really getting embarrassing at this point. Another thing is that I feel more of these hard-working Rioters who actually want, just like us, to envision a great future for the game need to speak up more about what&#039;s going on inside the company (thank you Cecilia D&#039;Anastasio for the Kotaku article that started it all, Barry Hawkins and the others that spoke up).\n\n Now as for the realistic point I wanted to bring up:\n\n**Will any of this actually happen?**\n\nThe answer is no. Money and power talks, this isn&#039;t just a problem that affects Riot but also every major tech company in America. The thing is most of these people I describe as being regressive man-children are the high ranked members of the company and there&#039;s no way on earth they&#039;d be willing to give away their position due to their ego (which we can understand if we see things through their POV). No amount of board, reddit or employer criticism will change their mentality as human nature is not something you can change with mere words.\n\nNow you might feel I wrote all this for nothing since it will not  change anything about the game but to me spreading some awareness, even if I might sound like a &quot;wake up sheeple epic gamers rise up we live in a society person&quot;, is probably the only thing I can do for now as someone who has been passionate for this game since season 2. I really incite other people to do the same.\n\nThank you for bearing with my rant and sorry if I didn&#039;t manage to be as neutral as possible with my opinion, I hope your day outside of league has been going great.","replies":[{"poster":"Academy Kayn","date":"2018-08-29T08:09:27.717+0000","up_votes":30,"down_votes":3,"body":"\"The reason the game sucks is because of sexism and frat mentality\" is the biggest fucking leap of logic I have seen to date, it's almost painful.","replies":[{"poster":"Crimson Zeppelin","date":"2018-08-29T09:06:11.664+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Dr Mercy,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=EO6Tx4Q1,comment-id=000d,timestamp=2018-08-29T08:09:27.717+0000)\n>\n> &quot;The reason the game sucks is because of sexism and frat mentality&quot; is the biggest fucking leap of logic I have seen to date, it&#x27;s almost painful.\n\nWell Dynamic que and the whole darn \"anti-toxicity\" campaign was made by one said adultery-committing chauvinist who got fired.

I would therefore say that when Tencent bought Riot, they were content to leave **Riot's** standards in place, as they would expect them to match what is needed to hit the legal requirements of the nation in which they're based.  I linked an article that made it clear that completely UNRELATED to Riot Games/League of Legends, Tencent was not any kind of particular leader on gender rights/non-discrimination and was in fact probably WORSE than what Americans would consider appropriate for these things.  That article is very recent (published in 2018), Riot was majority-bought by Tencent in 2011 (seven YEARS ago).  With all that in mind, I re-iterate that it is LAUGHABLE that **Tencent** would've been a leader to get Riot games to be better on this issue.  If anything, the evidence would suggest the OPPOSITE, but at \"best\" I would say Tencent simply maintained the status quo.","replies":[{"poster":"Illabethe","date":"2018-08-30T23:59:11.895+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually, what you said in both paragraphs is incorrect.\n\n1) I'm not saying Tencent abides by US law and regulation to stay legal.

I really doubt it is now that it's a 2+ Billion dollar subsidiary of a 21 Billion conglomerate.\n\nJust in case we need more clarification:\n\"In February 2011, Tencent paid $400 million for a 93 percent stake in Riot Games.\"\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot_Games#cite_note-8\n\nSo, it is YOUR contention, that Tencent owned 93% of the company (Riot Games) and were a MAJORITY investor possibly before that.  But they waited until AFTER they bought the final 7% to institute these all important procedural controls (since, in your words, Barry's story is from 2013 (2 years AFTER Tencent took ownership of 93% of Riot) when \"workplace sexualism was common\").\n\n(After looking over a bunch of articles, I can't completely confirm the 93% figure from wikipedia, but I can say that at minimum, Tencent bought around 85% of the company in 2011, I assume they already owned 8% (so no added cost for that amount), but all reports have Tencent paying around $400 million on a $472 million valuation, which would mean they bought around 85% at that time)\n\nBut the point is there's dozens of AMERICAN companies that have been getting busted for this kind of thing.

Maybe the fact that this kind of gross, wholly-inappropriate-for-work behavior is allowed to fester is because of a culture of everything-goes? Maybe, like OP said in the post you admit you didn't read, this is a symptom of a bigger problem, a bigger problem that also allows things like Dynamic Queue, class updates/reverts, and other unpopular, largely-seen-as-damaging decisions to go through? Maybe?\n> \n> But, y'know, you'd only be able to draw those conclusions if you read what op, and the article they linked to, had to say, without a bunch of **preconceived notions already brought to the table.**\n\nYou already brought a bunch of preconceived notions about how people should behave in the workplace. The OP and yourself both seem to think that a stuffy upright hypersensitive workplace beats a casual and laid back one, people above him at Riot preferred the laid back one. Which is resulted in the OP doing non-productive things like arguing with people and causing all sorts of problems that negatively effect production.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Jeddite","date":"2018-08-29T04:47:36.372+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":0,"body":"> _**\"GET WOKE, GO BROKE\".**_","replies":[{"poster":"OniSeiji","date":"2018-08-29T23:19:14.204+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A L L H A I L \n\nT H E Q U A R T E R I N G","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Madsin25","date":"2018-08-29T05:52:54.937+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":1,"body":"How about they just work on making the game fun and less of a clown fiesta instead of this irrelevant nonsense.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KVbqbFsC8e","date":"2018-08-29T04:39:41.590+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":1,"body":"I doubt it.
