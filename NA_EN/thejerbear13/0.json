First of all, the music and sounds keep playing while the client is in the background, so I have to mute everything to watch Netflix in queue or focus on any other task at hand. Secondly, the quotes when picking/banning champions are extremely loud and there seems to be no way to change it through volume sliders.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Zimberfly","date":"2016-11-08T18:23:19.135+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey folks, thanks for giving us this feedback. We're aware of the volume inconsistencies throughout the client, and we're looking forward to bringing you a much more tastefully mixed and balanced client (no more infuriatingly loud pick/ban quotes!) as well as highly customizable and granular control of different aspects of your volume levels, so you can tweak things to your particular taste.\n\nIn terms of sounds playing while the client is in the background, we find that those sonic queues are crucial for players to not miss their turn when it's time to pick, ban, or chat with teammates. We all know how frustrating it can be when the last pick in champ select dodges because they Alt-Tabbed out to watch a cat video :)","replies":[{"poster":"TheJerBear13","date":"2016-11-09T04:35:05.889+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot Zimberfly,realm=NA,application-id=2E4zVIwd,discussion-id=vPELERoi,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-11-08T18:23:19.135+0000)\n>\n> Hey folks, thanks for giving us this feedback.

Would this be possible with the LCU?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Wahrhe√Æt","date":"2016-11-08T16:37:43.560+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Had this same problem, but i mute the champion select music, the quotes are infuriatingly loud","replies":[]}]}
