I&#039;m a plat 5 Thresh main with about ~300k mastery on Thresh and a 67% win rate over 81 games this season, and I&#039;m concerned about my absolute favorite skin in League, Dark Star Thresh. \n\nThe Issue:\nWhen playing with the base **Thresh skin/Deep Sea Thresh,** throwing a hook in a direction that Thresh **IS NOT** facing will cause him to do the ol&#039; snake eye. During the casting animation for his hook, Thresh will continue to face in the direction he was **that he was originally facing when he pressed Q.** [Example of Normal Thresh Hook](http://plays.tv/video/58cee329dbbe6bd692/normal-thresh-snake-eye)\n\nWhen playing with the  **Dark Star Thresh skin,** throwing a hook in a direction that Thresh **IS NOT** facing will cause him to not do the ol&#039; snake eye. Instead, during the beginning of the cast time for his hook, **Thresh WILL TURN AND FACE THE DIRECTION OF WHERE HE INTENDS TO THROW HIS HOOK.** [Example of Dark Star Thresh Hook](http://plays.tv/video/58cee2d80ac7824f81/dark-star-thresh-issue)\n\nWhy this should be fixed:\nThresh&#039;s hook cast time serves basically as a huge red alert screaming &quot;Flash or Move because I am about to throw my hook&quot; and provides optimal time for any attentive player to begin moving away from Thresh and dodge his hook. Now I love Dark Star Thresh. I mean I LOVE this skin. The joke is the funniest joke in league and all the particles, especially the hook going from blue to red when he hits someone, are gorgeous, but being a Thresh main I know how imperative it is to be able to fake out players, ESPECIALLY as I climb into higher elo with more skilled summoners. In the current state, this issue causes me to consider Dark Star Thresh almost unusable. This may seem like a minor issue and it often does slip past the average player who may not be very aware of their surroundings, but when I am against someone who is much more skilled, this issue will cost me a good few hooks during laning phase and teamfights, often times these hooks are crucial to winning us the game. \n\nWhat I want to know:\nIs Dark Star Thresh&#039;s Q animation intended to work like this? If so, why? \n\n\nI would be very appreciative of any response providing insight into this or possibly some insight  from a member of Dark Star Thresh&#039;s dev team. Although, any rioter please feel free to leave a comment if you see this as well as feel free to add me in game **(My IGN is: [TheMofoJoJo](https://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=TheMofoJoJo) on the NA Server)** and we can discuss the issue as well as I will provide all of the intel I can on the matter and then some if needed.
