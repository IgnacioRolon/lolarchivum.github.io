I was just wondering where my mystery skin is. I haven't received it yet while many others have and it's been 4 1/2 days. I meet all of the requirements so I don't know why I haven't got it yet. The only offense I've ever had was a 1 day Leaverbuster ban when I was new to the game back in early S3 (I didn't know about that stuff back then). If you could get back to me it'd be wonderful and I would greatly appreciate it.\r\n Sincerely, *Raveion*\r\n\r\n**PS:** If anybody else hasn't received their gift even though they meet the requirements, please vote in the poll pod.","replies":[{"poster":"Hollymonster","date":"2015-01-09T19:28:59.669+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"You actually already got yours >.>\n\nMyrmidon Pantheon.","replies":[{"poster":"Oelyk","date":"2015-01-09T19:39:57.687+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"When they said \"rolling out in the next few days\", (implying 2-4) did they actually mean longer? how long do you think it will take to get every one there skins?","replies":[{"poster":"Hollymonster","date":"2015-01-09T19:42:20.801+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"We started rolling them out yesterday, so it hasn't even been a full day yet.

Now I read this 2 days ago, 7th of January, and the article was posted on the 6th. According to the article it says, \"*Riot intends to continue rewarding positive behavior in this fashion moving into 2015. *\" If they do continue you should get yours soon. I know someone who has 2 already, or at least he says. It as well states, \"*However, to give more context about this extrinsic reward, the key is that it is a surprise and not deterministic. What I mean by this is that it isn't some kind of achievement system where you are sportsmanlike for your next 10 games, then directly unlock a mystery gift. If you design a system like this, players will simply behave for 10 games, unlock their mystery gift, and go back to their normal ways.*\" I've looked at some of the comments, and some say that about things from past seasons, not taking place in 2014. Rito intends to release a mystery skin to all players who managed to make it through 2014 without being banned or punished for poor behavior. Anyone who didn't receive a chat restriction, ranked restriction, 14-day-ban or permanent ban meets the requirements. Which probably most of you know. \n\nThis took me like a good 25 minutes to write, well I hope I helped. \n\nTL;DR: Be patient.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Forbidden Siren","date":"2015-01-10T00:33:43.268+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm waiting for mine too. :(","replies":[]},{"poster":"A Little Eerie","date":"2015-01-10T00:14:41.330+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just logged in to the clien today and I didn't receive a skin.
