There is so much defensive itemization for them that if you don't have the damage to kill them, you won't. And tanks fucking don't.

They might block, or taunt, or somehow put themselves in the front of it, but there's one thing that tanks never did that Riot let them do; THEY LET THEM STUN! Stunning is **not** a tank thing! You're supposed to soak damage, not prevent damage from being dealt altogether. Tanks in LoL are, frankly, a disgrace to the name of tank. They have to be with the mobility they gave everything else, but still, *most of these guys friggin' stun*. It blows my mind.\n\nSo, overall, CC is not part of the term tank, never was. LoL peeps keep injecting it because we're so used to Garen being useless until reclassified, and Darius being unbeatable until reclassified, but in reality, *these guys can tank without the CC*. It's possible, guys, believe it.\n\n/rant.","replies":[]},{"poster":"deadlychuck","date":"2017-09-06T21:46:30.594+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"Except that CC and lock down is not a tank behavior, it's a support behavior.\n\n> If it locks you down and you die because you can't escape because you are CC'd then it's a tank.\n\nThe only notable differences is that a tank requires other champions to deal the damage, but the juggernaut doesn't. \nBoth are generally designed with heavy lock down power, but only one is given significant damage to follow up with.

They can force you to focus them a lot like cc tanks. Yeah tanks with 4 ccs and better damage reduction and even mobility which juggernauts were christened to not have are more OP yes agreed move along. Can we put this to rest now? It's pointless.\n\nWhich makes me wonder. Why is it some tanks are allowed to have all that? Some of them with less counterplay than others {{champion:79}}  vs. {{champion:14}} ","replies":[]}]}
