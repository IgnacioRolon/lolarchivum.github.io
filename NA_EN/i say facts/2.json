Because if it wasn't for the bs known as lethality marksman builds and so on that continues to screw with people,   {{champion:67}} would still be reigning as one of the top tier bs marksmen who could devastate thru alot of enemies thanks to how her Q which mixes a empower, able to use crits and deal that damage to even turrets grants her ridiculously strong poke power all tied up on a 30 mana cost with a 6~2 second cooldown. Plus doubles as a 'mini-dash' so a relatively experienced Vayne could use it to easily get out of CC fields(such as {{champion:245}} for example) and thresh/blitzcrank hooks before they are 'active/used'.\n\nLets also not forget that her W is a 'passive' aka no mana cost, which lets her do 6% of a target'a max health as true damage on every auto attack AT RANK 1, which doubles up to 12% by rank 5, letting her counter out immobile 'tankie' supports quite easily, plus once again, little to no mana cost on her 2 main damage measures. \n\nThis is not about being a bronze or low tier player, Vayne literally has innate tank buster and poke power and her passive gives her a nice hefty +30 move speed to help her gap close in a chase alot faster then some other champions, which her Q is going to grant her some extra distance cover to start hitting with those auto attacks even with her 'slightly below the range of some standard marksmen'. Item build wise she isn't as heavily dependent on it since her kit covers alot of the necessities (strong poke, strong disengage[E], strong tank buster counter, etc.) so she can easily be one o those champions who could rush a {{item:3086}} and not suffer as much from it as plenty of other marksmen i see that are just end up feeding themselves because they didnt op for {{item:1038}} first because it is quite a necessity for a good deal of marksmen to be able to have enough attack damage to deter opponents from trying to all in you often and if they do, you can have enough raw damage to take them out to punish them in that case. Vayne's Q and E is plenty enough to deny a initial dive on her and if she is allowed to free auto attack on you after that, she is likely going to rip half your health off in a few short seconds or less, secure the kill too if you don't quickly get away too if she doesnt have anything like low health to deter her from getting 'baited' out from under the turret.\n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}} \n\nReally, i would not be amazed that once Lethality ADC building gets killed off for good, that we end up seeing a rise on {{champion:67}} again. Though granted a player who isn't a total retard in handling a Vayne could likely shut her down before she gets her feed to rambo you thru her RQ combo combined with move % items so she can easily shred your health at that point to where you are not likely going to out damage her unless you have the most ridiculous life steal and end up crit life stealing repeatedly to overheal faster then she can melt thru your health.\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"Asayake 5150glow","date":"2017-03-31T21:41:17.072+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Avienal,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=p8PyNEni,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2017-03-31T20:03:36.370+0000)\n>\n> The topic opener or Rossy?
