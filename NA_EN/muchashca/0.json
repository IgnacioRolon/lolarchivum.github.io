{"poster":"Muchashca","date":"2015-05-15T19:33:11.854+0000","title":"New Karma: Complete Analysis","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":19,"down_votes":1,"body":"Over the last two updates, a number of updates have been made to Karma. According to ricklessabandon, who is behind these balance changes, the goal is to:\n1.  [Give her more power as a support](https://twitter.com/ricklessabandon/status/597748029580533760)\n2.  [Give her higher scaling into the lategame](https://twitter.com/ricklessabandon/status/597746750145884160)\nSo, let&#039;s take a look at her gameplay, skills, utility, and numbers to see if the changes accomplish that.\n\nBy way of credentials, I&#039;ve been maining Karma since her rework. By rank, I&#039;ve carried as Support Karma from silver to Plat 5, and like to think I play her pretty well. \nIn my opinion, the things that currently make her effective are:\n1. A variable and high utility kit, that can be used responsively to a wider variety of circumstances than most champions.\n2. The versatility to adapt well to the needs of the team, from full utility, to off-tank, to apc.\n3. A strong laning phase, including the ability to counter both all-in and poke lanes through smart play by poking hard enough that the enemy laners don&#039;t have enough hp to confidently engage in a 2v2.\n4. The ability to reset her Mantra quickly in a teamfight scenario by using opportune aoe abilities. \n5. Her power to zone high dps champions from a teamfight using her empowered Q.\n\n\nAn average game for me as is:\nLaning phase skills:\nQ - Poke down enemy laners, slow enemies that are trying to get in range to engage\nW - All in snare, when everything is setup to win 2v2\nE - Used in trades to mitigate damage to adc, get in range for W, win trades\nR - Mostly used to empower Q when you can hit both enemy adc and support, W in 1v1 or 2v2 situations in which you&#039;re being focused, or baits under tower.\n\nMidgame skills:\nI generally roam a lot during the midgame as Karma, getting killing and taking towers where lanes are behind, adding map pressure, and objective control.\nQ - Good for poking down enemy laners, putting your teammate at an advantage so the tower can be taken. Extra slow on escaping enemies.\nW - Used especially in 1v1s, good for setting up kills for teammates.\nE - Mostly for getting around the map, mitigating enemy poke.\nR - Used more frequently on W than during laning phase, RW is by far the best choice in any 1v1 situation because it does more consistent damage than Q, and the healing, especially when low, is huge when combined with shield. Q is empowered any time you can hit two or more enemies, or need to zone someone. RE is only used in medium to large skirmishes where its damage will hit three or more enemies.\n\nLategame skills:\nLategame is all about objective control and teamfighting. Karma&#039;s teamfight is probably the main reason I do as well with her as I do.\nQ - Used for either dealing damage to a cluster of people, poking down enemies before a teamfight, or zoning an adc or apc during a teamfight.\nW - Generally used to stop anyone that tries to dive the adc or apc.\nE - Saved for the adc or apc, to allow them to position, deal damage, and prevent damage.\nR - Mantra is most important at this stage in the game. I always use it on W in a 1v1, but that&#039;s uncommon lategame. My usual strategy is to use E to help my top or jungler dive their carries, then use RE on my team, because it both shields the team and almost instantly resets Mantra due to the two teams being mixed together so much. After getting the mantra reset, I use RQ on the most dangerous carry on the enemy team while snaring any diving enemies. RQ is great for zoning out a carry for a few seconds, and does enough damage to create kill opportunities for teammates.\n\n\nKarma&#039;s skills in this patch, not including costs, since they haven&#039;t changed.\n> \n> Passive\n> Autos reduce Mantra cooldown by 1 second, spells by 2 seconds\n> \n> Q\n> MAGIC DAMAGE: 80 / 125 / 170 / 215 / 260 (+ 60% AP)\n> 25% slow for 1.5 seconds\n> \n> Empowered Q\n> BONUS MAGIC DAMAGE: 25 / 75 / 125 / 175 (+ 30% AP)\n> 50% slow for 1.5 seconds\n> 1.5 second delay\n> DETONATION MAGIC DAMAGE: 50 / 150 / 250 / 350 (+ 60% AP)\n> Max potential damage 155/350/590/785 (+ 150% AP)\n> \n> W\n> MAGIC DAMAGE: 60 / 110 / 160 / 210 / 260 (+ 60% AP) (three increments over two seconds)\n> 1 / 1.25 / 1.5 / 1.75 / 2 root if enemy stays in 675 radius for two seconds.\n> \n> Empowered W\n> BONUS MAGIC DAMAGE: 75 / 150 / 225 / 300 (+ 60% AP)\n> Same snare, but within 1000 radius\n> 20% (+ 1% AP) * missing hp heal on cast and on snare\n> \n> E\n> SHIELD: 80 / 120 / 160 / 200 / 240 (+ 50% AP) for 4 seconds\n> BONUS MOVEMENT SPEED: 40 / 45 / 50 / 55 / 60% for 1.5 seconds\n> \n> Empowered E\n> AOE SHIELD: 30 / 70 / 110 / 150 (+ 30% AP)\n> MAGIC DAMAGE: 60 / 140 / 220 / 300 (+ 60% AP)\n> BONUS MOVEMENT SPEED: 60% for 1.5 seconds, all within 600 radius\n\n\nKarma&#039;s skills on PBE  ***Updated***\n\n> Passive\n> Autos lower Mantra cooldown by 1/1.25/1.5 (at 1, 7, 13 strangely)\n> Spells lower Mantra by 2/2.5/3\n\nStraight buff, positive change. Maybe people will realize she has a passive now. Buffed by 0/.25/.5 and 0/.5/1 compared to live.\n\n> Q & Empowered Q\n> No changes\n\n> W\n60 / 110 / 160 / 210 / 260 (+ 90% AP)\n> 1 / 1.25 / 1.5 / 1.75 / 2 root if enemy stays in 675 radius for two seconds.\n> Can target monsters.\n\nRickless just posted an update to this, and it was exactly what the community was asking for. The ability to target minions has returned, which isn't a bit deal for normal W, but it is for RW. The increased scaling fomr 60% - 90% is nice as well. It will hit harder than Q lategame, which makes sense, because the tether is much harder to land. Good buff!\n\n> Empowered W\n> All bonus damage from Mantra removed, deals the recently increased W damage.\n> 20% missing health heal on cast and on snare. (Need to confirm)\n> Snare increased to 2.75/3/3.25/3.5 seconds\n\nI haven't been able to confirm this yet, but it seems her original healing has been restored, which was the biggest thing we've been asking for. The notes Rickless has been posting are horrendous, sadly, and it's hard to tell. The first update says the healing was removed, and no update has been posted since then, but it does seem to be back.\nAssuming these new numbers are accurate, lane and duelist Karma are back, just will some waveclear nerfs and snare buffs. The skill still won't do as much damage as it used to with a full tether, but the increased snare is a fair compensation for that.\n\n> E\n> Cooldown lowered to 10/9/8/7/6 seconds from 10 seconds at all ranks\n> Mana cost lowered to 60/65/70/75/80 from 60/70/80/90/100.\n> Shield amount decreased to 80/110/140/170/200 (+30% AP) from 80/120/160/200/240 (+30% AP)\n\nMore shields more often, slightly smaller. Decent buff.\n\n> Empowered E\n> No longer deals damage\n> Now increases primary shield by 30/90/150/210 (+30% AP)\n> AoE shield amount increased to 50% of the primary target&#039;s shield from 30/70/100/150\n\nPrimary shield received a slight buff, on top of the small buff on base E. The numbers are a little hard to calculate for this, so I&#039;m going to put out a scenario where Karma goes mostly AP, ending the game with around 600, and levels shield second. It&#039;s not stated that the normal shield still has the .3 AP scaling, but I&#039;m just going to go with the assumption that it does, giving the primary mantra shield a .6 ap scaling. The numbers would be then, roughly:\nAoE shield goes from 30/90/150/210 (+30% AP) to around 55 (+39 at 65 AP)/100(+72 at 120 AP)/145(+144 at 240 AP)/160(+240 at 400 AP)/205(+360 at 600 AP). \nSo, this is a good buff overall IF you&#039;re building AP on her, which is fairly normal. Heaving hp builds, such as Jungle or Top, or full utility builds, or builds that level shield 3rd (leveling shield 2nd is expected on support, but leveling W second is normal for Karma top. At least it was, there is little reason to do so anymore) will have roughly the same AoE shield as before.\nThe biggest change is the damage, which would lose 60 / 140 / 220 / 300 (+ 60% AP) magic damage. The two main reasons I ever use RE are to get a fast cooldown on Mantra during a teamfight and to fast push waves of minions. I use RE very, very rarely to setup engages, because Mantra is so critical during the teamfight itself, and there are better ways to engage.\nThe new RE would provide a bigger shield for four seconds, and could be impactful during a teamfight in ways that the current shield isn&#039;t. It seems the emphasis is to make it more of a standard AoE shield, and less of a unique, useful, versatile spell.\n\nOverall positive changes:\nIncrease her snare time by .75/1/1.25/1.5, at the cost of 75 / 150 / 225 / 300 ( + 30% AP)\nLets her use smaller shields more frequently.\nBuffs her passive to reset Mantra in general skirmishes.\nIncreases potential AoE shields for AP builds.\n\nOverall negative changes:\nDecrease the damage in her overall kit by 135 / 290 / 445 / 600 (+ 90% AP)\nRemoves many reasons to use R on anything but Q, removing one of her most dynamic and unique aspects, and possibly the main reason I play her.\nRemoves her ability to reset Mantra quickly in teamfight scenarios.\n\n***Updated PBE skill and analysis***\nThis third wave of changes was a big move in the right direction. Many of the parts the community hated most have been removed, the ability to heal for RW has been finally restored, but the shield bomb is still absent. Rather than being a net loss, the parts of Karma that have been removed are being traded for decent buffs, and she should be fairly strong in her current rendition as Support, Mid/Top, and even Jungle. \nShe'll have greater difficulty quickly clearing waves, but will be able to shield for more during teamfights or snare for longer. The current trick of being able to Mantra twice during a single teamfight has been removed by removing the damage on RE, so it will only be possible if you get an exceptionally lucky RQ.\nI will need to play her to be sure, but these changes seem like a net buff now.","replies":[{"poster":"Darth Pixy Misa","date":"2015-05-15T19:54:55.136+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":1,"body":"The changes are even worse now..... \nKarma does not need to be changed, No one wants Karma to be shoehorned into being a support.

As far as I know, Karma is balanced, has a decent skill base and a high skill cap. Versatile with damage, but has to actually hit skill shots to do it.\n\nThere's other champions like Katarina who touch their keyboard and win the game. Reckless, overpowered, easy, \"freelo\" champions. And they nerf Karma? Out of every champion in the game, even nerfing Garen would make more sense than Karma.\n\nOh and they go and nerf Cassiopeia too.","replies":[{"poster":"Thryale","date":"2015-05-16T05:50:19.019+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"if you thought this karma was good mid lane, you missed out on old karma.\n\nI still miss the 800 hp shield bombs (only shielded one target, but the amount shielded was dealt out as aoe dmg) and perma sustain with healing wave + old chalice.

So what is a support champion?  Something that has variable levels of CC and or tank and whose abilities scale mostly or entirely with just levels.  Quite a number of tanks already work well as nice fat initiating supports (Nautilus, Sejuani, etc) or bodyguards (Volibear, etc).\n\nDiscounting Karma and actual mages being used as a support, you have seven \"mage\" supports.  I'm using a definition of not being awkward to use (so not counting Lulu or Soraka).  You've got Anivia, Sona, Syndra, Zyra, Lux, Morgana, and Orianna.  Compared to other kinds of supports, we've got  about 12 tanks that either are supports (whether official or meta), or have been used as a support or bruiser in the bot lane, and about nine \"healer\" supports (champions that keep you alive through shields or heals and _without_ body blocking incoming damage).\n\nGranted, there are four other mages being used as a support, but the \"mage\" support line is the smallest.  So Riot probably panicked and is trying to reformat Karma as a support.\n\n--\n\nIn all honesty, while Karma is probably the only true mage I actually understand and have experience with, her kit is just awkward to use against more traditional mages that stay at range and then blow you up with their ultimates.  I figure this is a major concern for anyone who is not a Karma god, and probably why they don't play her as much as a mage (top or mid).\n\nIt feels like a catch 22.  Aside from hardcore Karma mains, less people are playing Karma as a solo lane mage and more people are playing her as a support.  So Riot is step laddering Karma from a mage to a full blown support.  If more people played her as a mage and not as a support, Riot would step ladder her to being a much more competent mage.  But being an awkward mage for most people, it's only going to cascade her into a true support.\n\n**_Which, suckkssss._**","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Maximum Zilean","date":"2015-05-15T20:18:13.631+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"With Karma being my secondary support, I am not looking forward to these changes since I also play her mid and top occasionally.

They are pretty much making her W useless. I really hope they reconsider, but knowing rito they will not.\n\nAnd if these changes are because Karma's low pickrate.

Its cast and leash range are both absolutely garbage. Even with Q/E, it's impossible to actually snare anyone with CC or a gapcloser (read: anyone released after 2012). Just something small like increasing the tether range limit by 40 or so every 0.4s would be an immense help.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Avious","date":"2015-05-15T21:16:56.028+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm really curious to see if they will revert any of these since everybody hates the changes and it's quite a nerf...","replies":[]}]}
