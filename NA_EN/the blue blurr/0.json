I always only get cs when I support if I’m last hitting and my adc is nowhere near. Trying to grind out Rakan to level 7 this preseason was nuts. I literally have screenshots of my journey through the grading system. I went 5/1/25 with like 70% KP and a 60+ vision score (vision was always something I prided myself on in any role) and I got an A+.... S grades often times make no sense as I got my final S token (never got an S+ once grinding him from 3-7 over a week) I had a significantly worse score but more cs so *shrug*","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hotarµ","date":"2019-01-01T06:49:49.874+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They don't? \n\n You can easily get an S rank with a good vision score and good kill participation. Does it help to CS? Yes, and you should be snagging a few minions here and there, but not enough to hurt your ADC.\n\nsource: I'm a support main with a few M6/M7s","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kai Guy","date":"2019-01-01T07:22:58.637+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"As a support player. Its my belief that if you don't last hit free cs, then  your trash  and/or  not being very efficient in your playing.\n\nOh this gold is going to be wasted.

Grab it when its there. If you don't then you hurt your teammates.\n\nYour adc backed? You need to learn and know how to manage waves. How to freaze lane. As well as when to push to prevent the enemy bot from returning to a advantageous lane position. Deny their cs by feeding it into a tower.\n\nYou know, just basic mechanics.","replies":[]}]}
