The roots of the trees kind of grow in her and supply her with the posion.\r\n\r\nHer Q would be like zyras tiny plant seeds but when cast a poisonous flower grows and instantly explodes in a poisonous cloud, did i mention poison.\r\nHer miasma(W) would just be green with little shrooms around it , lastly her twing Fangs (E) are just two wooden claws enhanced with poison.\r\nIt would be cool if when she ulted the enemy champs turned into wood but i would imagine that would take a lot of work lol\r\n\r\nLast though; are Cass&#039;s posions really poison wouldn&#039;t it be venom?\r\n\r\nHAPPY TO HEAR YOUR THOUGHTS\r\n\r\nPS.
