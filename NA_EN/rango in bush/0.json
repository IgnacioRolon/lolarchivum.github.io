It appears that as soon as I start downloading I get my usual download speed, but as the download progresses, my download speed rapidly reduces to around 200kbs. Seriously doubt it is something to do with connection issues, as my league client downloads fine.","replies":[]},{"poster":"snappythebear","date":"2017-11-01T02:24:50.032+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yup, slow for me also.

I have around 90/mb download speed, so it was rather disappointing to read that the download speed was a mere 690kb/s at best. I rechecked my overall download speed using my phone, and i had 20mb/s download speed with everyone in the house (4) using their devices through WiFi connection. I'm not sure why this is happening but its really inconvenient.","replies":[]},{"poster":"kocka1111","date":"2017-10-14T21:29:23.660+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it doesn't even shows me how fast it downloads","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mcswagx","date":"2017-03-18T00:37:46.444+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Extremely slow for me also{{champion:223}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Princess K","date":"2017-03-17T19:35:57.415+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I got accepted yesterday and after waiting 7 hours, it was only at 24%. It then had to restart due to maintenance 2 times, and one time due to \"internet connection problems\". I got it going again and left my computer in sleep mode so it can download and be done by today. I wake up to another \"trying to connect to the internet\" and after 5 minutes, \"exit the client and try again\". This is honestly ridiculous and sad. I thought PBE was supposed to be a fun experience. I'm happy to be a tester but so far I haven't been able to even play on it. {{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Platter","date":"2017-03-17T15:36:38.490+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I got stuck with 20-40 kb/s which gives me an eta ~ 48 hours; also 3 times during the download I had to restart due to errors and Riot maintenance .

Speeds can very depending on the strength of your connection and even quality of your hard drive.
