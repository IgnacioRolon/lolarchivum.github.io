I'm playing normally when all of a sudden I get the 'attempting to reconnect' message.  Last might after about 15 of trying to launch the game it told me I had a application error.  In the end got back into the game (and placed in lower priority queue.  Tonight tried playing again.  The 1st game I played I had no problems.  2nd game I get the 'attempting to reconnect' message only this time when trying to reconnect i'm being told 'unable to connect to server' message.  I know my internet connection is sound but have no idea what to try next.  Anyone else having problems?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-13T22:55:12.648+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your issue sounds like a network problem failing to reach the game server and timing you out.
