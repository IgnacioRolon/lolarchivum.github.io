This is a cast time that veigar players have learned to work around. It's the same with his w. His w fall time isn't actually that long, but from cast confirmation to fall, it is extremely long. From cast confirmation to the 0 damage stun, it's a full 1 second.\n\nNow, this isn't difficult to fix. Just remove the cast time entirely so he can cast it on the move and the cast time isn't added to the delay and instead of veigar's changes being an across the board nerf, you can actually claim you gave him something.\n\nEDIT 3-3-15: ALRIGHT, Riot, when are you going to admit you made an absolutely massive mistake on this one? Veigar is down just above 40% win rate and is falling by the day. But yeah, these nerfs made so much sense on a rarely played immobile character who was sitting just under 50% win rate. Please revert until you can at least think of a better set of changes that aren't a straight up nerf.\n\nEdit 3-4: VICTORY\nVeigar's E now stops dashes cold and the particle effects pop up at the beginning of his cast animation.

Its like if Sona's passive decayed. It just makes all the planning and reaction involved with playing Annie go away. Annie doesn't cast one spell to get her stun up, she casts FOUR. Five if you count the spell she must cast to proc the actual stun. \n\nIf you see support Annie walking towards you with her stun, blow her up. She is incredibly squishy and her range is as short as Ryze's (possibly shorter). Gank her lane a lot, make her blow her Flash on escape.

Its also not in and of itself a stun, Annie has to make sure her passive is up before diving in. Her passive could be blown early, not be ready yet, etc--its something you have to plan for. Combine all of this with the fact that Annie is incredibly squishy and does not have a gapcloser, and you at least have a skill that is usually telegraphed and can be played around. Annie pretty much requires Flash (or a Kalista ult maybe) to get the jump on her opponents. Its also her ult and not just a regular skill she can cast anytime, so it can afford to be a tad stronger than, say, Veigar's stun (one has an 80 second flat CD at rank 3 the other has a 16 second CD at rank 5...shorter currently on PBE)\n\nAs a support, Annie performs poorly against the likes of Leona, and can fair bad against Thresh or Blitz because of their superior lane engage and natural tankiness. A decent Braum and/or Caitlyn can also make bot lane hell for her. In mid, Annie is terrible against poke and has to be really careful around assassins because of her short range. Hence why you don't really see Annie mid all that often.\n\nI feel like Annie is one of the few examples of a decently balanced champion. Yeah, her Tibbers can be annoying, it can be a game-changer, but there's also plenty of counter-play against her (squishy, short range, you can see when she has her stun).
