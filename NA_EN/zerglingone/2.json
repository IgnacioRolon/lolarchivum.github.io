Probably the biggest frustration as a melee character against him is his ability to charge up a 3rd Q, then E E E-Q E E E away with no real way to dodge it or retaliate against him. His dash is non-homing. It always goes to a specific distance and direction based on his and his opponents start position. He would have to choose which direction he fired the Q, and instead of 0 cast time you get .25 seconds to react.\n\nHis tornado Q is far far more awkward to hit, even close range than his dash-Q. Even the base dash-q is also more powerful than the regular base Q in terms of AoE hit. It removes a LOT of skill from playing him.","replies":[{"poster":"IronwallJackson","date":"2016-09-19T17:49:40.872+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll pretend that I agree with you for now.
