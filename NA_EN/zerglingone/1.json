Not one thing.\n\nI just want to know, what's with the aversion to it?\n\nI went looking through the champion and item list, and literally all flat consistent on-hit damage is magic or true.\n\nList of champions and items: Wit's End, Teemo, Irelia, Nashor's, Varus, Devourer Enchantment, Cho, Spellblade mastery, Kayle, Lulu, Akali, Corki, Thresh, Warwick, and Volibear.\n\nNot only is that the list of champions with flat, consistent on-hit magic or true damage, that's the list of every champion, mastery, and item with flat on-hit damage period.\n\nDo you feel it would be imbalanced? If so, why, and on which scale of over or underpowered?\n\nIf it's thought to be overpowered, why? Because of life steal? Because the number for it to be noticeable over just building AD would have to be unreasonably high?\n\nIf it's thought to be underpowered, why? Because it doesn't interact with critical strike? Because it wouldn't hurt towers?\n\nI don't get it honestly. Why is there none in the entire game Riot?","replies":[{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-03-11T00:45:28.918+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"On-Hit physical damage is AD. For every 1 bonus AD you have, you have 1 more damage added to auto attacks! It's just silly to ask for a physical damage on-hit when AD is physical damage on hit.","replies":[]},{"poster":"XaviorZeroBlazer","date":"2015-03-11T01:06:31.996+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i would guess, it would make killing turrets and inhibitors way to easy","replies":[]}]}
