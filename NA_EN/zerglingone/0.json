I mean just after too, because often I'll keep the window open for chat purposes, and I receive normal dings from message receiving. Maybe look into the code that governs the transition from the \"game in progress\" lockout mode back to the standard mode. There could be a state change issue that offsets the audio.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BigKitty","date":"2017-05-24T21:13:54.125+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have actually the same problem and still going.
