But it&#039;s just all wrong.\n\nI figured that maybe with the original creator back in the mix they&#039;d fix a lot of the problems DS2 had, but I was wrong. It is still a step in the wrong direction for the series and here&#039;s why.\n\nIn the first Dark Souls, the difficulty was a product of enemy placement, and whether you know what&#039;s around corner A and corner B respectively. Everything hinges around your ability to engage and fight opponents. Whether you studied your opponent for a moment while hiding behind a shield before deciding on a plan of attack, dodging until you find an opening, or if you just keep ramming your head against it until it falls over and dies. All definitely viable ways of approaching the game.\n\nIt fully engaged its player in the combat and how they approached given encounters. It had a system built around 1v1 combat, and approximately 95% of all combat you do against anything above throwaway enemies is 1v1. So when you DO get to the climax of the game with arguably the hardest boss fight, you&#039;re suddenly faced with a situation where you&#039;re forced to fight 1v2 against 2 strong as hell bosses and you have to learn the proper positioning and tactics to take them out. You have to study their patterns, learn their downtimes, and engage them based on that.\n\nDS2 and 3 throw that shit right out the window. Enemies have no god damned down time whatsoever, there is never a point where you can&#039;t be hit, everything and its mother knocks you down and can then continue hitting you on the ground where you can&#039;t do that yourself to opponents, and you are CONSTANTLY in fights with enemies that are harder than throwaways in 1v2 or greater odds. The games have ceased being fair and it&#039;s really a crying shame, because Dark Souls is a MASTERPIECE of a game on the basis of its fairness alone. The first few times you play through it, it&#039;s hard as shit, but it&#039;s just your own skill holding you back, not some unstunnable enemy that knocks you down and crushes your skull under the weight of its unblockable boot if it gets within 300 pixels of your hitbox.\n\nIn Dark Souls, you never feel like the enemy has some kind of statistical advantage over you, except for maybe number of spells they can cast. It feels like you&#039;re fighting an opponent that has stamina just like you, that gets staggered and stunned in similar manners to you. You understand why Havel is such a boss when you get his armor set and nothing can ever poise break you again, you feel like your character is part of the game.\n\nThere&#039;s a massive disconnect with the more modern games. Where enemies with seemingly unlimited poise (while wearing cloth or no armor at all), pancaking attacks everywhere, and infinite stamina to keep swinging and swinging and swinging at you with no window to retaliate. It feels way more video gamey, and that&#039;s not a good thing in this case.\n\nI&#039;m very disappointed in you, From Software.\n\nSorry for the rant, I&#039;m just really upset that they&#039;ve overlooked proper game design and pacing to give the game a sense of artificial difficulty that it doesn&#039;t need. Mind you, I am progressing, and ultimately am enjoying myself, but it&#039;s different from how I felt through the entirety of the first game. I&#039;m not feeling a sense of accomplishment, I&#039;m feeling a sense of relief that the constantly appearing bullshit parts are over.\n\nEdit: update. I am doing better now. Gonna beat the game soon.","replies":[]}
