Why? because you literally get free hp while still being able to deal insane amounts of damage. It also rewards you to power farm and counter jungle which is why graves and nidalee are so good. Ask any high elo jungler sota is broken.\n\nof course you took strength of the ages into the jungle.\n\nbecause it was the only kestone that helps you jungling. all the other ones dont do jackshit for you (i think dft might be the only keystone that even triggers on jungle monsters).\n\nthe mastery itself isnt op, its just a lack of alternatives why it was taken on every single jungler.\n\nand as far as free stats go, fervor ruined most of the season. its about 70% of the reason why bruiser assassins were a thing. the rest being % health damage in their kits.\n\nand its batshit broken on marksmen aswell. fervor jsut grants way too much item independent damage to auto attackers.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"III BAKURYU III ","date":"2016-10-19T00:04:21.278+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":3,"body":"Any type of sustain or health item or mastery is being gutted from Riot.  \nI feel like this game is less about sustaining  but more about just fighting-fighting-fighting-fighting. AKA Mortal Kombat 2.0. \n\nThe old option to have biscuits/potions/flask together is gone because players could play safe while farming in lane but that option is now gone, but instead we get a new flask that only benefits fighting. \n  Some people just want to worry about CS and the lane phase not about kills 24/7, I thought worrying about CS was important and knowing how to freeze lanes proper was too.  \n  Didn't we all get told back in the day that only bronzies worry about kills, while CS marks the great players?  Now look kills are more meaningful than Cs is.  You cant freeze lanes anymore, any and every sustain item is getting gutted but the damage of the item isn't being affected.  Which should let us know that Riot only wants people to fight again, over and over again. \n\n  I'm most likely wrong but I see the upcoming patches with the items, stealth champions, 15 min surrender option(which just means in low elo players will want to surrender even early before they even hit their champions power spikes) and it's not interesting me and the game has been on a slipping slop for me personally.  This will be my last year playing this game, nothing wrong with this game as a whole but I personally don't care for it as much anymore.","replies":[]}]}
