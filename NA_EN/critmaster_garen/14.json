Having tailored upgrades/sidegrades to each champion's abilities so that you can tune them to your playstyle would be a lot easier to balance and downright cooler than the rune system. \n\nThere are 137 champions in League. \n\nEach champion has four abilities. If each ability had three different augments (damage, sustain, utility), then that's 1644 different augments that would need to be made. \n\nNow, that sounds like a lot, but I think it's a much less of a huge effort than it seems. \n\nFrom a coding perspective, each one would be about as easy to code as a simple item, since all they would offer is altered numbers. Increase a slow duration here, convert a stun into a knockup there, add more scaling on this ability, etc. There wouldn't need to be any unique effects added. \n\nArtwise, they could simply recolor the ability icon that is being modified (e.g., red for damage, blue for sustain, yellow for utility). \n\nIt would be a daunting task, but it would certainly be possible. It would allow the devs to fine-tune the different options a champion can have. No more \"We can't buff this rune because it would make the champs it's actually good on overpowered\" nonsense. Each champion would be their own entity, and their abilities could be tuned as such. \n\nDoes Jhin have too much movement speed? Gate a portion of it behind an augment. Force him to choose between it a different upgrade to his kit in order to become The Fast. \n\nIs it hard to find a balance between Zoe's viability and fun-police abilities? Give her the choice between being more control mage-y with traps and sleeps, or being an artillery assassin-y with intense damage and range. She doesn't get both at the same time, but both playstyles are important to Zoe. \n\nPlayers could adapt their champions to the matchup they are in and their preferred playstyle. You could choose defensive variations of your abilities if you're going into a hard matchup, or take augments that let you push the advantage you know you'll have in lane. \n\nThis sort of thing would add the depth that Runes Reforged was _supposed_ to add, not set-in-stone \"best build\" for virtually every situation, but real choices for every champion.","replies":[{"poster":"Gramps69","date":"2018-09-13T15:07:29.182+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":2,"body":"I'm glad more people are realizing the issue with the current runes reforged-- it's not necessarily that they are overtuned/overpowered, it's that I don't really feel like I'm picking a champion anymore, I'm just picking a conduit that best abuses conqueror, or electrocute-- it's like a champion's kit doesn't matter as long as they can choose an in-meta keystone.\n\nI think switching to this augments system would be incredible, and people saying it would be hard to balance-- not really, you'd just have to tweak a couple numbers here and there and see how it affects one champion, instead of the electrocute 'nerfs' that dropped damage a small amount but halved the cooldown on it, which meant the cases where it hurts the most (laners, a la Zed) basically received a buff anyways while junglers that like electrocute got screwed by the change.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LongDong S1lver","date":"2018-09-13T23:14:01.020+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pretty much this.

I don't know about anyone else, but this mode has been some of the most fun Ive had on league for a while. Even with a bad game people aren't angry.

Firstly, you have talent synergies, which leads you down the path of picking talents that synergize with each other or you're gimping yourself. That's why you see \"Q build\" or \"W build\" and whatnot there: you determine at the start how you're going to play, and you won't really deviate from that unless you have no other option, and if you do have to deviate then you're instantly weaker than you could be. As an example, why would I pick up a Scatter Arrow talent on Hanzo if I'm going a Q build? Picking a Scatter Arrow talent over a Q talent would literally mean I'm splitting power between 2 skills in a game where maximizing 1 particular skill is often more useful. \n\nSecond: This means that the strength of your talents is going to go a long way in determining the viability of a heroes. Diablo in HOTS had a decent kit before his rework: his Q wasn't bad, his W was complete garbage, his E wasn't bad, his Apocalypse ult was actually pretty good. However, his talents were so good that he was pick or ban despite overall mediocre skills. Conversely, heroes who have decent or good skills are held back by terrible talents, like Ana. \n\nThird: In terms of balance it's basically a zero-sum game. You have more interesting design, but the granularity makes it both easier and more difficult to balance. Easier in that you can more precisely find what the problem talent is for that individual hero, and harder in that you have far more levers to pull to begin with and it's incredibly easy to make someone busted or useless by pulling the levers wrong, or make a particular talent completely unused even in builds where it would ordinarily be great. \n\nI can see the draw, since I do like HotS, but ultimately I'd prefer my abilities do a single set-in-stone thing and I work around that in a PVP setting. That's more reliable than going in and not knowing whether that Malphite is going to rock you as an AP Burster, slap you to death as AD, or be that mountain rock of bulk he is as a tank. That makes champion picks incredibly hard to work around, which is neat until you realize you have to actually deal with it. That incredible versatility to me feels absolutely great... in PVE.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Mokuto Bunshi","date":"2018-09-14T02:26:43.037+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=VoraciousX,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=A2Jutc7X,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-09-13T06:26:32.866+0000)\n>\n> I played HOTS a few times and there was a similar system for it.

There might still be some nerfs to be had, but I don't think it'd be super significant.
