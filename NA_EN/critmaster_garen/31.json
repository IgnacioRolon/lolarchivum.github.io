Her ult was actually better (from the perspective of the Fiora, though annoying for the opponent) previously. I've gone from \"deal with her kit, hope her ult doesn't kill me\" to \"her kit is a bit annoying, but just CC her and her ult simply won't work\" and I'm not scared of her even a little. \n\nHer ult was the main reason she was so annoying because she would snowball and wreck multiple people. Now? Meh. She can't team fight anymore and her ult is really easy to avoid as she has to completely run a circle around someone without being killed her CC'd.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
