Garen's keeping his silence as a result, for while it's click to hit it's also a melee ability and he doesn't have a dash/jump/blink.","replies":[{"poster":"Zenthon Prime","date":"2015-07-31T07:46:36.695+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Honestly, could we have a few more silences?

Tryndamere is on the same spot (especially since he can activate his ult despite being silenced).\n\nOn top of that, silence does nothing to prevent a champion from coming to you, so if they are already on top of you, many times you would wish that you had a stun instead.\n\nSilence is a good CC, but they are not really that powerful.","replies":[{"poster":"BastionKross","date":"2015-07-31T13:45:22.984+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Depends on the champion, really.

Garen's there primarily for damage for example. He does bring a little bit of CC, and he's happy to soak up some damage where he can, but his ideal goal is to spin on someone then ult them for a kill. Tanks by contrast, even if they've got similar builds, tend to be much more focused on setting up the enemy team for others to kill and/or protecting their own team.

In this way he seems like a pub stomp champion where he is best used against a disorganized team to make the most out of his ultimate. \n> \n> Going into details about his kit, his abilities that grant movement speed are mediocre as they can all be stopped rather easily either by taking down his shield or by cc'ing him/Flashing. Add to that his slow is not very potent for him to close with he has a hard time reaching the target. Then there is his passive which in concept is cool but with his other problems he can't use it very well unless dueling.\n\nmaybe its because i just build him differently, but he usually starts to really take up steam around level 16, and when he has about 3 items completed with randuins, cleaver and ghostblade.\n\nhis main power spike seems to be around 30 to 40 minutes, and he then drastically falls off if the game drags out longer. even though he doesnt fall of so hard that hes useless. the very late feels kinda weak but not terrible.\n\nit feels like full build garen vs full build everyone else feels too weak in damage output or tankyness.\n\nbut i think that could be tuned by increasing his crit scaling without actual major changes. the problem is, that while he has crit scaling on his spells, an infinity edge doesnt get him the same powerspike as other champions who would build the item due to how crit only partially applies to the spin.","replies":[{"poster":"Sightless66","date":"2015-08-01T16:35:51.503+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That post wasn't actually about Garen.

It shouldn't be something that lets him build full tank and be useful (I don't want to see him as a tank either), and hopefully the new items they're planning for AD Bruisers will help the whole 'AD Bruisers build full tank with maybe one offensive item' problem that's existed since forever.","replies":[{"poster":"Calibretto9","date":"2015-07-31T18:02:15.816+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"A melee champion that doesn't build mostly tank is a rarity, unless you're a carry.\"\n\nIt's not that rare currently. {{champion:59}} , {{champion:86}} , {{champion:23}} , {{champion:114}} , {{champion:92}} , {{champion:62}} , {{champion:107}} , and many {{champion:58}} s build almost completely damage these days.
