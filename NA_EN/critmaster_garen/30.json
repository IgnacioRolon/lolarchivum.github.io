Kali gains a Physical Penetration bonus against that god, and if she lands the killing blow, she heals for 80% of her maximum Health and recieves a +25% gold bonus. A new Death Mark is selected any time her current target dies, or if Kali dies it is set to whoever last hit her. if you have ever played kali then you would soon see how terrible this passive is. unlike kali garen is tanky and doesn't depend on the killing the enemy to be able to fight, but both cannot control who gets the mark and both are will have to be balanced around the optimal circumstance. if her marks line up perfectly for her she can easily 1v5 an enemy team. however, the chances of that happening are so low its not ever worth giving it a number, but even though she almost never gets that situation she must be balanced around it because there is still a chance. \n\nthe problem with garens new ult passive is that it will be extremely OP in the extremely unlikely chance that everything lines up(because it is random), but completely useless when it doesn't line up at all. if it goes anything like a game playing kali then 80% of the time it does almost nothing for you aside from a little bonus dmg. But, even though it will be mostly worthless(ex. mark is in another lane, they are out of reach, it's on a bad target .etc) garen will have to be balanced with the \"optimal\" situation in mind.\n\nin conclusion giving a champ a huge strength that the have zero control over is a bad idea. also, this a jg passive not a lane passive and it will all but complete make him unable to chose where he ganks because the mark will chose for him. this passive looks like a balancing nightmare just like kali's is for her.","replies":[]}]}
