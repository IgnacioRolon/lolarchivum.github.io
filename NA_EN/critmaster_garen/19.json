Since I go CDR boots on Vlad the 7% magic pen is pretty important, as I don't really get any magic pen until late game when I can pick up a void staff\n\n2) It's pretty rare in top lane trades to stay in combat for 4 seconds with an enemy champion.

Deathfire touch may be bad, but at least it will do some damage to all enemies when I use my aoe.\n\n4) As Vlad, depending on your build, your hp is going to be hovering from 3k-3.6k most likely. 3% of 3k is 90, at 108 if you get your hp to 3.6k. Meanwhile, depending on your AP, Deathfire touch will likely be doing ~ 110-120 damage over 3 seconds per single target (So your Q) and 55-60dmg over 1.5 seconds for your aoe (W, E, R). There also appears to be no cooldown on Deathfire touch, so it definitely does more damage than Grasp of the Undying.\n\n5) With the lifesteal/spellvamp already available to Vlad, the 3% Lifesteal isn't all that great or necessary, and as shown previously, does less damage than Deathfire Touch. \n\nIf I were going to look at the Resolve Tree, I might look at the Strength of Ages keystone. But that would only provide 300 HP (Which would give Vlad 7.5AP). 7.5AP wouldn't outdamage either Deathfire Touch or Grasp of the Undying, but at least add a little extra health with some extra damage.\n\nStill, I feel Deathfire Touch is the best option - but compared to keystones available for other champions - it feels incredibly underwhelming.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Abyssphere","date":"2015-11-12T14:32:03.798+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"I don't know why what is basically a Liandry's passive was even considered the best thing to give mages. Liandry's is a super niche item solely because its passive's strength varies wildly based on the kit of the champion in question. Why is that considered a good thing to make the only option for the mage class as a whole when it so clearly benefits a small amount of champions much more than the rest?\n\nI mean I guess standard burst mages can go for Thunderlord's Decree but that thing is a weirdly conditional Luden's with a massive cooldown.","replies":[{"poster":"Kalarepa","date":"2015-11-12T22:32:38.100+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe Riot added more dots for #lcsbigplays.

Come on now. Prices were all very balanced. Only thing that's anti-mage this season is the lack of good keystones, though on malz, Brand, Cass, Morg(Adds quite a lot of unavoidable damage when that Q lands, guaranteed 20% for the Q and another 10% from the W underneath them on top of her huge ratios), and Swain (His E empowers it). 4s of DoT is the equivalent of about 11/30 of your AP, which is about 36.67% of your AP. Swain gets to boost that by 20% with his E to make it into about 44%. His E does 282+96% of his AP at max level E and now you're throwing an extra 44% onto that.

With that in mind, Riot already said they were looking at a possible hotfix to Warlord's because it's giving way too much power compared to the other masteries but I agree; it's unfair that AD characters get perfect synergy with their masteries through crit while casters don't have a dedicated AP-scaling keystone.
