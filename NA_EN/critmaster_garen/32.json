This is especially problematic given Trundle is an AA reliant zone-control champion who doesn't have any gap closers other than a stationary movement speed increase and a stationary snare zone.\n\nTo counteract this, Trundle's Q applies a fairly hefty snare (I think it was nerfed down to 60%?) for the duration of the animation.
