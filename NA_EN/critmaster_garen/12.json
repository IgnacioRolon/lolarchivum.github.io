Even a healing potion is more effective than his passive, granted his passive will outlast a healing potion if you let it keep going. \n\nHis tankiness is due to his W, which is Courage, gives a constant passive of 20% bonus of your current armor and magic resistance. Garen reduces incoming damage by 30% and gains 30% crowd control reduction for a few seconds when activated, but during his cooldown, he has neither, thus leaving him with only two abilities to use for damage. His Q and E are both meant to be used in combo unison as an anti-mage champion, which he tears through with his follow-up spin, but is naturally weaker against other tanks unless he gets the black cleaver, which helps a bit.\n\nNo, he isn't a damage heavy champ. There are plenty of champions out there that can dish out hell of a lot more damage than Garen (mainly ADCs of course), and in fact, there are plenty out there that can shred right through his tankiness (armor pen, dur). CDR is not worth taking on Garen at all, since it minimizes his cooldowns to such a small degree, that its practically wasting gold.\n\nIf you have such a difficult time taking him down, just remember this.

Lol.\n\nhe also has 0 ranged abilities or hard gap closers. he literally has to walk up to you with a mediocre speed buff if he wants to trade with you. (35% movement speed, where similar champs like shyvana get to more than 50%).\neven most relatively low mobility champions have some form of ranged ability to harass. olaf can throw axes for example. trundle can throw a pillar into your face and block off your escape route when he wants to fight you. rumble has 2 shots on his e that allow him to chase or disengage. not to mention that his flamethrower has quite a bit of range in the first place, ina ddition to his speed boost on his w.\n\nhes resourceless, but his base cooldowns are pretty long to compensate. and his damage is entirely dependent on his cooldowns. it drastically drops off after he cast his spin.\n\nmana champs have no issue with mana, after they got tear or other ap items that have mana attached. its just a different stat they have to invest into. garen needs cdr. mana champs have lower base cooldowns and need mana instead. both can spam their abilities relatively well by lategame.\n\n\nbasically everythign garen does only happens in melee range. combined with his low mobility this makes him very susceptable to kiting. hes the same type of champion as renekton or riven, only more tanky, because he has to walk up to you instead of having dashes. and then he somehow has to keep you in melee range, because he doesnt have a stun or knockup like those guys.\n\noh, and his passive is barely noticable throughout the lane phase. come level 16, its pretty much the only thing that sets him apart. other champs have in combat sustain built into their kits (renekton q) or items with lifesteal, which is a terrible stat for garen.\n\na vamp scepter already beats his passive in lane in regards to sustain.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2015-07-31T01:18:16.772+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yup\n\nand that game ended in me screaming like a little girl when about 3 different kills got away due to a random ass bug :) \n\n:') \n\n\n:'(","replies":[]},{"poster":"theragingnerd","date":"2015-07-30T21:42:37.908+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"he left ult range ult is larger then AArange","replies":[]}]}
