In the middle of a fight everything stopped. My internet was fine and it just kept saying reconnecting but wouldn't connect. So I exited the game and the launcher didn't show that I was in a game and the reconnect button wasn't there.\n\nI immediately queued another ascension game. What happened to that game? Did it crash and burn?\n\nAm I going to get a leave for a game I couldn't return to?\n\nJust to be clear the game did not end we had just started it recently, and I didn't wait long for the \"reconnecting\" when I exited the game.. it was just gone...","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-01T00:38:15.515+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahhhh it sounds like that game may have actually crashed entirely server side. If you could never try to reconnect and could requeue just fine, most likely everyone else was booted out as well and you won't get any penalties for it.","replies":[]}]}
