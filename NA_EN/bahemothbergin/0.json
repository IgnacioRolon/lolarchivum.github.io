But after you finish all the missions you still wont have enough tokens. The border is the only thing I wanted and i wanted to earn it not buy it so I decided to do the missions. So I was wondering if there is a way to get enough tokens without having to purchase them?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-16T04:33:52.519+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can still get more tokens by doing missions! You'll be able to complete different daily missions each day, and after a couple days you should have more than enough to get that icon/border!","replies":[{"poster":"BahemothBergin","date":"2017-06-16T05:01:24.706+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"OK thank you I really appreciate it.","replies":[]}]}]}
