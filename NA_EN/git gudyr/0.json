They were the most chill, laid back, fun games I've had in quite awhile. Nobody raged, nobody trash talked, and nobody was toxic. The one person who _did_ start in on the enemy team when I was playing with Katey got real quiet when they realized. The fear of retribution is real.\r\n\r\nIt just sucks that people have to be watched over constantly to not be jerks. My game tonight with Asyrite, who absolutely crushed it from the jungle, was the least toxic game in Plat I've had in weeks. People should really go into each game as though somebody from Riot is watching what they say. League would be such a better environment to play in.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-03-03T18:45:03.778+0000","up_votes":34,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh, hey! I remember that game! Your name is, uh, quite memorable. :P \n\nI've always been about the whole, if you don't have anything nice to say, then don't say it. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm far from perfect, and sure, there are time when I get angry. Rather than typing in all chat, I just complain in Skype. :P Doesn't hurt anyone's feelings, and it doesn't shift the morale of the game. This probably sounds pretty lame, but hey, it works. \n\nI don't think it's a matter of going into the mindset that there's a Rioter in the game, but just that you're interacting with other human beings and should treat people the way you want to be treated. Honestly, would you really say a lot of the mean junk you say in chat to someone's face if you encountered them IRL?  ~~Probably ~~ Hopefully not.\n\nAnyways, that's my two cents. Oh, and thanks for the game! Hope to see you around. :3","replies":[{"poster":"Decrit","date":"2016-03-03T18:51:21.329+0000","up_votes":32,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot KateyKhaos,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=E8eqMHdW,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2016-03-03T18:45:03.778+0000)\n>\n> Oh, hey!

That said, don't be afraid to have fun and poke fun. \n\nFor example, I play Nami a ton and I say 'fish bait :3' in chat sometimes when I bait someone out. Or, I spam laugh when I miss my bubble. I actually did that in game, and had a Thresh laugh every time he missed a hook. :P\n\nI could have been mean and said, \"LOL GJ GET REKT\", but 'fish bait :3' is a bit more lighthearted, and, at least in my experience, has lead to some fun competitiveness and funny chat (especially when their team has a Fizz and says the same thing to me when he baits me ._.).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"La Barbotte","date":"2016-03-05T11:33:36.344+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"i played vs a rioter once, i was el tigre braum, i asked him if we won could they push for the skin name to be changed to braum cena and have the soundtrack play when you cast the ult, they didnt say yes, but neither did they say no, so im still waiting for that to happen guys, i wont forget XD (dreams)","replies":[]},{"poster":"lildyo","date":"2016-03-03T18:52:04.661+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's unfortunate how many players lack the self-control to just not vent their frustrations in chat. I'm generally quite calm and level-headed most of the time, but the odd play can create a lot of frustration. It just seems so counter-productive to voice those frustrations at either your allies or teammates. Doing the former will make your teammates less likely to cooperate, and the latter will make your opponents more likely to capitalize on your apparent frustration.
