What happened?","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Miscellaneous","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"I've been playing since season 3 and there has been a profound change in how people talk in game.\r\n\r\nGone are the jokes, casual back and forth, and random funny conversations between people.\r\n\r\nIn now is \"get rekt noob u suck lol 4v5 owned ? ? ? ? ?\". Even when it is not phrased like little kid MLG memes, it's still just tired ass discussion about the current game in progress.\r\n\r\nLike, it's all about who sucks, who is good, who won lane, whose fault it is that x tower went down. People lose their lane, and they complain in all chat about it. People win, and they talk shit about it. Like, people can't just play the game and win or lose gracefully. They die, and feel the need to make an excuse in all chat. They win, and feel the need to talk shit. Why? I don't know.\r\n\r\nEven people trying to defend their teammates from shit talk still steer the conversation back to \"well you know it wasnt his fault so and so camped top\". Why does this need to be explained? Why is the focus so hard on the game....even pub games and norms? People used to be civil and joke and banter back and forth. Now I feel like it is nothing but self-centered, tryhard children.\r\n\r\nMaybe it's the age of the average player going down? I don't know. But I would pay money to only play with people who are verified 18+. I feel like this may be part of it. I'm not sure. I just miss the old days when the back and forth was a lot more intelligent and varied and not just this game-focused analysis of who is winning and losing and who sucks and is good.","replies":[{"poster":"WyvernEgg","date":"2017-04-25T21:01:18.661+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"No one cares about summoners code anymore.
