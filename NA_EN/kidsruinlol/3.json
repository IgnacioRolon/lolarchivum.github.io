MIA. Lost a 1v4? MIA..right in your face! Die to their super fed mid? Hey, let's all MIA the guy about 30 times!\r\n\r\nI understand the meaning of it when it is used properly, but now it has just became a way for little kids to talk crap in a passive aggressive way about EVERYTHING they don't like. \r\n\r\nI have completely disabled sound on my pings. But you can't disable pings completely, because Riot wants a little bit of frustration to go hand in hand with League so as to not make the game too fun for everyone.\r\n\r\nStill...Haven't ganked my lane 3 times in 5 minutes? \"Enemies are missing\". Won't give away your first blue as jg? MIA. \"I wanted that!\". Died to a good gank by the enemy team? MIA time guys! Get your pingers ready! Spam it right on his model!\r\n\r\nThe MIA ping is now the way for the average lol player to show you what a spoiled little brat they are with the stress tolerance of a diabetic mosquito. Anything happens they don't like? MIA MIA MIA! Right in your face!\r\n\r\nAnd yet, though you can disable the sound, you still can't disable the pings...because Riot does not want its players to be happy.","replies":[{"poster":"Lil Sag","date":"2017-04-19T02:51:32.502+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kinda like this? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Rps1F0DoII\nPersonally i think its a funny meme","replies":[]},{"poster":"I Might Lose","date":"2017-04-18T19:11:23.866+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Spam Mia pings this post\"","replies":[]}]}
