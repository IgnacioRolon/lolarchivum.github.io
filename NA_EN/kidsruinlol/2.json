Do you really post this crap and believe it?\r\n\r\nYou spend hundreds or thousands of days, months, years playing League only to come on the boards and constantly chalk everything up to a conspiracy theory or some sort of foul plan to ruin the game by the people that feed their families off of it.\r\n\r\nAnytime someone works a little mini Riot insult into a post, or claims some kind of evil malfeasance on the company, you all chime in. \"Yea man! Tell em! That's the truth right there! Finally someone standing up for us!\" All of the Riot poking I see not just today but in general, in every post and on every subject is distinctly a case of the First World problems most of you suffer from. \r\n\r\n\"Game has X problem....Riot is Illuminati!\"\r\n\r\nIf you are so wrapped up in your little computer life that any kind of momentary problem causes you to lash out and cry foul, claim a conspiracy, and go full Donald Trump....please go outside. Open up your window. Take a walk. Make a real human friend. It will get you far.
