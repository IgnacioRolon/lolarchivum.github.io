Building full tank is the only way that he can survive teamfights, and this makes him very reliant on his team for success. Yes, you can provide lots of utility for your teammates, but those teammates still need to be capable of using that utility to their advantage.\r\n\r\nBuilding damage on singed means you pretty much die instantly in fights, even with your ult running.\r\n\r\nSo this has left the champion in a state which I feel leaves him pretty helpless. He feels like a champion that&#039;s just &#039;along for the ride&#039; now, instead of how he used to feel.\r\n\r\nBack in Season 5, which was my favorite season playing this game, Singed was able to build a bit of damage and a bit of tankiness, and actually function in a fight. If you were good at the champion, you could carry teams that were behind and lacked damage, because you could make up for it. There wasn&#039;t a ludicrous amount of CC and damage in the game back then. It always felt like you could have some form of impact on the outcome of a game. The same can be said of season 1-4, in addition to 5.\r\n\r\nRecently however, for me, Singed has not felt like that anymore. His ability to win focuses on how good your teammates are, not on how good you as a singed player are, and that is something I don&#039;t enjoy at all.\r\n\r\nI miss older seasons of Singed where he actually felt like a powerful champion, not an annoying wet noodle with 4k hp that dies without doing any meaningful damage.\r\n\r\nSo yeah, regardless of whether or not he&#039;s good right now (which is debatable in itself, Lehends plays much more support than he does Singed), I just straight up do not enjoy how our champion is forced to be played right now. I greatly dislike the current play-style, but that&#039;s the only one that stops you from dying instantly.\r\n\r\nmy rant\r\n\r\nI agree 100%. Singed can not carry like you used to be able to....and is not viable anymore as a decent pick. Seasons 1-5 he used to be good. You could carry. Now you have to build full tank or you just get blown up. Now you are just a semi-ok disruptor who loses lane against 75% of meta tops. This is fine, because singed isn&#039;t a &quot;lane-dominant&quot; champion. But more and more you get a lower and lower tradeoff for playing well. He has had 0 love as other laners were getting buffed and buffed. And now people play Singed for the love of the champ....not because he is viable or &quot;good&quot;.","replies":[{"poster":"SirΤeemο","date":"2017-04-01T20:55:58.654+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"who cares? after all signed  is a 0 skilled champion to play.. the only thing you do is getting tanky and running all the time while you have Q ","replies":[{"poster":"InSingedWeTrust","date":"2017-04-01T21:49:11.154+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SirΤeemο,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=gN28owG6,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-04-01T20:55:58.654+0000)\n>\n> who cares? after all signed  is a 0 skilled champion to play.. the only thing you do is getting tanky and running all the time while you have Q\n\nEven though he has the highest difficulty rating of all champs. :)","replies":[{"poster":"SirΤeemο","date":"2017-04-01T21:52:11.720+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"yea... sure lol","replies":[{"poster":"InSingedWeTrust","date":"2017-04-01T21:56:02.090+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SirΤeemο,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=gN28owG6,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2017-04-01T21:52:11.720+0000)\n>\n> yea... sure lol\n\nCheck the client, even Riot stated they see him as the most difficult champ alongside Rumble. :D","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Eedat","date":"2017-04-01T21:08:20.714+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds like any other salty main rant","replies":[{"poster":"kidsruinlol","date":"2017-04-02T10:34:01.004+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Minish is responsible for alot of the \"meta\" shifts in singed in NA.

He´s an AP bruiser.\nThe way his kit works is that you build mana items that have ap->your passive gives you decent health->ult->hp+free resists=tanky enough to be a bruiser without Juggernaut steroids.\nBut the meta has shifted so far from that basic idea that noone builds any mana or ap on him any more. Not for a loooong time.\nBut because thats how his kit is supposed to work, that is also how he is enjoyable to play.\n\nAnd there aren't really any other champion options for those that like the map movement planning and wave management that Singed excels at. His mechanics are basics, but how he plays the game gets quite complex. In fact, because he is so basic that you have brainspace left to do all that planning and stuff.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Shadòw","date":"2017-04-02T15:21:31.981+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you teamfight with Singed?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Glîtchy","date":"2017-04-01T21:02:42.670+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=LyingOnLine,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=gN28owG6,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2017-04-01T20:57:26.237+0000)\n>\n> Oh noes, Singed has to rely on his team to be good, just like every other tank in the game?\n> \n> What a horrible tragedy!\n\n\n*looks at {{champion:122}} and {{champion:36}}* you sure?","replies":[]}]}
