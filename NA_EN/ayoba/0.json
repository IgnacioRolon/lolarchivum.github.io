Pretty much just me and my irl friends.  Anyways, a while back there was a patch ( i cant remember which one) and i was no longer able to have access to it.  It does not appear in my options tab or anything.  I inquired to my friends and they are all still in it and also it says that i am still the group leader.  Could someone pls help me?  Id like to be able to talk to my friends wihout having to start a new club. Or at least i'd like to be able to use the same name if i have to make a new club.","replies":[{"poster":"MrTrufax","date":"2018-03-26T13:05:06.711+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I also cannot access the club I am the leader to.
