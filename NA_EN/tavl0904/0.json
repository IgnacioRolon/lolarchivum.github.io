I tried to reinstalling it, but the same thing happens. I've seen people saying about 'lol.launcher.exe, lol.launcher.admin.exe and LeagueCilent.exe', but none of them work - lol.launcher.exe and lol.launcher.admin.exe doesn't open the updated cilent when i click launch, and LeagueCilent.exe says \"the file or directory is corrupted and unreadable\". I even tried running it as admin but still doesn't work. I'm not an expert in computers, so any solutions?!?~~\r\n\r\n {{champion:32}} {{champion:32}}","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-16T21:03:32.455+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see you've found a fix that works for you, but keep in mind that workaround might only last temporarily.  Soon enough those old legacy files will be removed, but the inherent issue may be security settings not configured to allow league's files as an exception.  You should go over the steps of the [permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) guide to update those settings, as well as running a repair with the [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367).
