Riot should make a \"DECLINE\" option for gifts so this does not happen to another player....  I know that if the option was there I would NOT have accepted these gifts sending them back to that jerk and would still have my account....\r\njust saying...\r\nits something that should be considered","replies":[{"poster":"Teky Beki","date":"2017-04-19T05:09:40.458+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeahhh its been a while and still riot is not giving me my account back this is bull sh!t and what else is retarded is the fact that when i go to the repayments page it tells me i have $ 0 owed","replies":[]},{"poster":"Teky Beki","date":"2016-07-11T18:54:04.973+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so basically I'm screwed .... this is the response I got from the second ticket I created\n\nHello Summoner,\n\nUnfortunately, we cannot remove the ban until it has been repaid.
