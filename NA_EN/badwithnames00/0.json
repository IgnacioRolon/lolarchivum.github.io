I got kicked off the account and could not log back in. The password had been changed and I don't receive emails to reset it. I looked for a number to call customer service or something, but for some reason Riot doesn't have one. So I submitted a ticket, as requested. I haven't heard anything from riot in 4 or 5 days. What else am I supposed to do if Riot won't even respond to me?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-06T22:45:53.002+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Our queue is a little backed up at this moment, but we will respond as soon as possible.  Keep in mind that replying to your ticket can bump it back to the bottom, so it's best to hang tight.  In the meantime, we have some resources to help you regain access via our [account recovery](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751694-Recovering-Your-Account) guide.  Our account recovery team will be able to help; you'll be in good hands!","replies":[{"poster":"BadWithNames00","date":"2016-08-07T01:03:22.414+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I appreciate that , but that account recovery guide is completely useless since everything it says to do fails. I just feel like it shouldn't take a week to do something. Blizzard and other companies I've played with respond and help the same day. I don't see why Riot should be any different.","replies":[]}]}]}
