Nothing that couldn't be fixed by going over the old one and cleaning it up a bit.\n\n>The new splash on the other hand has crystal clear lighting, and despite being just white, it feels more natural.\n\nYou call it \"natural\", I call it \"bland and boring\". The lighting in the original was awesome because of the contrast it created - Fiora with black and silver armor standing in front of the golden window looked incredible. Now it's what? Fiora in a bland white shirt standing in front of a bland white window.\n\n>As for the background as a whole; It may not be entirely to your taste, and that's okay. Nothing wrong with opinions. But you cannot deny that it's drawn well.\n\nI have no idea why they gratuitously added all the architecture to the picture. The old splash was great because it completely focused on Fiora, standing in front of the light in shining armor. The stair and the bannner in the new one are *decently* drawn, but they have no business being in that picture as far as I am concerned. All they do is draw focus away from what the splash is supposed to show.\n\n>And Fiora's hair...

Fiora is a noblewoman, so I kinda expect her hair to be neat, despite her being a duelist.\n\nHer hair isn't messy, she's supposed to be in motion, jumping forward or spinning around. You know, things a duelist does. It's actually one of the few instances where Riot's \"action pose\" obsession didn't end up looking forced or completely out of place. The new splash goes for the exact same thing btw - it's just hard to see because the hair is so badly drawn. It doesn't even look like hair, it looks like a single piece of plastic, drawn with two brush strokes, that she's wearing as a hat. Meanwhile, you can almost count the individual hair in the old one. It looks so much better it's not even funny.\n\nThe head in general is by far the worst part of the splash. Not only looks her hair cheaply drawn, her face can only be described as a mess. Her original face looks actually natural - the new one makes me think of a barbie puppet with too much makeup, stylised to the point of grotesque.\n\n>I'd love to hear your opinion on what exactly makes the new splash so awful in your opinion though. I've just found it a bit hard to pinpoint exactly what you dislike about the new splash (Besides Fiora's chin and cheek problems.)\n\nWhen looking at both pictures, the impression I get from the new one is pretty much that an artist wanted to recreate the old one, but completely failed to see why it works as a picture. So he just took every element of the old one and threw it together in a new picture that is worse in pretty much every aspect apart from those that can be chalked up to the age of the original. The new splash simply feels like a cheap knockoff of the old one.\n\nAlso, everything I mentioned above.","replies":[{"poster":"Castanean","date":"2015-07-22T04:07:15.158+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Respectable points and opinions. I can see why you'd prefer the older splash.\n\nThough, I think that just like with the new one, there ARE issues with the old one too.\n\nFor instance; You talk of motion. So I have a question. Which way is old Fiora moving? Her hair suggests she's moving backwards, but her cape-y... things as well as her leg placements suggest she's going forwards. So does her posture with the Rapier too, actually. Looking at the window in the background... Fiora is either standing *very* diagonally, highly suggesting she's basically running forwards, which would conflict with her hair motion, or the building is built diagonally.\n\nI don't think the perspective on the new splash is too bad either. It shows off what Fiora actually looks like better than the old splash, showing her entire face. That's a pretty big part of what the splash art does, isn't it? Giving a look at what your champion looks like in details the in-game model does not. (That, and of course to show who the heck you're actually fighting.)\n\nAs for why New-Fiora's hair looks \"Cheaply Drawn,\" I think that's more an issue of how exactly the hair is cut. It's cut in straight cuts, which kind of causes that kind of effect visually. The hot-pink streams probably don't help that a bit either. What makes Old-Fiora's hair look \"Messy\" to me though is probably caused by the muddy lighting. If they DID touch up on her old splash, it'd probably look much nicer.\n\nThe new splash *definitely* has issues, mostly with Fiora's head, but IMHO, it's not that bad and could have been way, *WAY* worse.\n\nIn the end though; That's all these are. Opinions. If this is the way Fiora stays, so be it. Her new kit looks *way* to fun for me to let splash related issues stop me from playing her. It doesn't even really matter to me, since I'll probably be using the Royal Guard skin anyway.
