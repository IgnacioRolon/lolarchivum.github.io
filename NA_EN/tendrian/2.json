For me it seems like the VU fits exactly the part of her personality that you pointed out. Instead of functional armor she has golden and useless armor parts everywhere - just take a look at her rapier (is that the right word? 'Degen' has 2 english translations so I'm not really sure..) - it's so golden and overly large that it is obviously the weapon of an arrogant person.\nIf they now fixed her hair and the splash I think the VU would be good2go.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Staraptor","date":"2015-07-22T15:54:02.251+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"I'd have to disagree, I don't really see how her old outfit was any more \"glorious\", if anything the amounts of black and grey make it much more subdued.
