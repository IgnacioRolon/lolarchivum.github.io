I click league of legends it starts up but it wont go to the login screen I've waited an hour and it was still loading. I don't know if this is a bug or my computer but I usually have to restart it for something to work, and even then sometimes it doesn't work. For example I've been waiting for about 15 minutes, and still loading. I really don't know what to do, I've tried scanning my computer and I've also tried running as administrator, and I even tried downloading League of legends again.","replies":[{"poster":"oO ViRaL Oo","date":"2017-03-30T16:14:50.953+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its not the internet, I can promise you that, I think it has to do with the new client because often times when I have the old one, it works just fine, but I wanted to download the new one again last night, I haven't played since.","replies":[]},{"poster":"oO ViRaL Oo","date":"2017-03-19T02:18:14.961+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please help me...","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-03-19T04:28:20.616+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Broporo oooooon duty!{{summoner:31}} \n\nSince you said that it can sometimes load after you wait awhile, and that you've tried running as admin and reinstalling, it makes me think that this is more of a connection issue between your network and our servers. When it takes forever to load it could be having a really hard time establishing a stable connection to our servers, so it just sits.....and sits.....\n\nLet's try going through our [Connection Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to see if we can get you set up with a more stable path to our servers.","replies":[]}]}]}
