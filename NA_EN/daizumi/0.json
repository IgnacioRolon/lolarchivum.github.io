As usual, I won some, lose some, gained divisions and lost them, but as I kept losing I started noticing something strange. No matter how often Id get an early lead, (First blood, first dragon or first tower maybe a couple of kills) I&#039;d still end up losing unless if I played perfectly or basically 1v9 carried the game. I&#039;m not the type of person to take L&#039;s for free so I started doing research into my games, looking for any trends that come up such as champions i consistently lose to, or builds that don&#039;t work out or match ups that I need to aid sooner (being a jungler). Nothing was really consistent except for one trend. If my bot lane lost, we lost, even if I was fed, or if my top laner or mid laner was fed. \n\n**Is it really true though?**\n\nWell first I checked my match history in detail. (for my match history specifically I only checked my Udyr games because thats my One trick and sometimes I do pick other champions either due to boredom or because my champ is banned / another champ might fit the situation better.) Up to this point I checked and found that in the games I won my bot lane was ahead and/or smashed the enemy bot lane. in the games I lost it was the exact opposite.  I couldn&#039;t believe it so I checked my friends match history and even random players (like Trick2g&#039;s account) and found the same trend. \n\n**Does it happen 100% of the time?**\n\nThe short answer is no. But from what I saw its about every 4/5 games which feels too often if I&#039;m trying to carry or Say if I want to help top lane who&#039;s facing Darius or Illaoi. If this statistic is true, then I&#039;d have a way higher chance of winning getting bot ahead even if Darius gets fed or if the enemy mid laner gets fed.  I will say there are some games where 1 -3 players (IF top mid and jungle per example) do really well they can carry the game despite their bot lane, but this doesn&#039;t happen that often. \n\n**What I conclude from the little digging I did**\nIf you play top lane, jungle or mid, going even in that lane or winning isn&#039;t enough. You either have to pub stomp your lane / opposing jungler  so you can oe shot or murder their bot lane, or get your bot lane ahead if you can&#039;t smash lane super hard. It feels pretty bad to me because I love jungling but it feels like going ADC instead of jungle despite not being super good at the role by any means could net me more wins because I&#039;m pretty good at not feeding at the very least even if I lose lane which should give the ones on my team trying to carry the maximum chance to do so. \n\n**Additional context: **\nhttp://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=%20Rengar%20Mustang\nhttp://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=D%C3%A0izumi\n\nAbove are my Op.gg&#039;s for my accounts if you wanna check them out. My alt I mainly use it to practice Rengar because He&#039;s my second most favorite champion right now.  \n\n**Conclusion**\nI&#039;ll end this post by asking a favor to whoever reads this and cares enough to respond ( I doubt many will). Can you check your match history and see how often this trend happens? I&#039;m hoping that its just me that&#039;s  making too many mistakes in my games because then I could identify my mistakes and fix them to improve my chances of winnning (although I don&#039;t feel like you should have to play PERFECT every game to climb but that&#039;s besides the point).","replies":[{"poster":"Toxicate13","date":"2018-03-11T08:28:19.145+0000","up_votes":60,"down_votes":6,"body":"I don't need to check my match history to know that this shit happens.

And if I'm top lane and their bot lane wins, they will be at our inhib tower at 10 minutes and I can't do anything about it. But if my bot lane wins, they will carry the game and I feel bad because I don't have to do much. Riot is making the game more and more focused around bot lane, and it's annoying for everyone else because it's basically a coin flip whether or not you will lose the game based on how your bot lane does.","replies":[{"poster":"Daizumi","date":"2018-03-11T08:38:14.121+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":2,"body":"I feel ya dude.

I&#x27;ll probably start playing it a lot more now.\n\nIf the jungler's going to camp a lane, it will be bot lane because most junglers realize that the AD (carry) has the biggest impact on the game. If you get a Vayne fed and she's good at the game, its basically game over because what is everyone else going to do? Mid and top can win lane, but if their bot lane is good they can easily carry. Especially if they have someone that builds ardent like Janna, Lulu, etc. I HATE ARDENT SENSER. I HATE HEAL AND SHIELD SUPPORTS. It's so annoying because the ADC can play as reckless as they want and still be able to live out of it. And what does Riot do? They buff champions like Jhin and say \"he hasn't been very good\". If you've got a good support bot lane, you can easily carry. I play Darius a lot and if I'm ahead, I can 2v1 the enemy top and jungler no problem. But if the bot lane feeds, I can't do much. They will just kite. And if I pull them, their support will be there, either using crowd control or shields to help them. Sorry for this wall of text, but I really do think this is a major issue and I want to write about how much I hate it.

The game is absolute garbage (comparatively) right now.  Everything is focused on \"the excitement of quick games in eSports\" that the rest of the game is in a toilet at best. \nBot lane decides the game...either turret first blood or one/two kills and an ADC just rolls.  There's no playing safe any more.  There's no real strat to this game, it's pretty much towerdive murder once you get an iota ahead. Rinse, repeat, game.  \nSome people will say in higher rank it may be different, but at the end of the day the strats are pretty rinse and repeat.  I can't stand to play ranked any more because from support I can't do much of an impact, but I'd rather not have 2 people feeding bot.  I also don't have faith in other supports and I'm an iffy adc.

Yes, matches get decided mpst of the time by which bot is ahead, but getting bot ahead is not as much in the hands of the adc as people think. Support usually has more impact on the early lane(if the adc atleast is somewhat decent), and they synergie between adc and supp is even more important. if they are on the same page and their opponents are not, they will stomp that lane even if they are worse players individually.\nJungle and Roaming mids can also have really high impact on botlane, though they need to play around it rather than playing for them selfs.\nOnly Top is really left out and relys on the heavily telegraphed TP to get any impact on bot side.\n\nIt sounds paradox, but botlane(especially adc) beeing more impactfull for the game than other positions doesn't mean that the adc-player has that much impact and can easily solocarry(though grabage adc's can solo loose)","replies":[{"poster":"RocketRelm","date":"2018-03-11T15:22:01.846+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":">It feels pretty bad to me because I love jungling but ***it feels like going ADC*** instead of jungle despite not being super good at the role by any means ***could net me more wins because I'm pretty good at not feeding*** at the very least even if I lose lane which should give the ones on my team trying to carry the maximum chance to do so.\n\nI think that was his point, actually. \"I'm not feeding trash, so if I go adc, our adc will never be feeding trash\".

If I go bot and don't get anything, then two bad things happen -- I lose gold and experience, which makes my future ganks less effective and makes me less capable of dueling the enemy jungler, and I give away my location, which opens up ganks/objectives/counterjungling to the other jungler.  \n\n(2) A losing bot lane is ungankable.  If your bot lane is losing, chances are there is a skill deficit in addition to the gold deficit. If you come bot into that, you might just feed the enemy adc an extra kill, particularly if a countergank happens.  \n\nThe most effective way to deal with a fed enemy bot lane is to get mid to roam with you.
