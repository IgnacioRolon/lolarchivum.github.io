However in game i usually have an average of 110 - 150.\r\n\r\nI mean I understand the port handle ping request is differ from the port running accrual game. There should be more traffic on the port running the game lead to more delay. But it should not be that significant.\r\n\r\nAnd i play other game like Warthunder or First Assault with only 15 ms ping usually.\r\n\r\nAny potential problem?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n8d8a68ee_8463","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-17T19:30:21.467+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If your routing to the NA region is solid, then there might be more local issues causing your ping to increase.
