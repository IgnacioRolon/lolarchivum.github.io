Shaco isn't particularly interested in Cinderhulk, the item that started the jungle buzz in 5.5. He doesn't benefit from the Athene's buff unless for some reason you build him AP, which is dumb unless its an ARAM. Soooo....exactly what game change are you referring to that made Shaco nerf-worthy? If anything the fact that he falls off makes him LESS viable because tank junglers scale extraordinarily well into the late game and Shaco doesn't hardly at all. Rek'Sai is still good, Vi is still good, Lee Sin is good, meaning there are also early game junglers that can prevent Shaco and his lanes from snowballing. All in all, I agree with what you are saying, but Shaco does not need to be nerfed. He is at most a tertiary beneficiary of various changes, and even that is stretching it.\n\nAlso, quick note on Sejuani: most people already said Cinderhulk might push her to OP status, and she was already seeing LCS play before Cinderhulk's introduction.

It was the way that UOL was able to punish GMB's faulty engages that allowed UOL to trade safely versus GMB while Shaco was able to push towers. IIRC the announcer specifically said Shaco became a strong factor in the game because he took a **long** amount of time farming the lanes and pushing towers. The extra gold allowed him to build more items at a faster rate. Also, if GMB were able to take care of Shaco and find him in his jungle early on, especially during their invade, Shaco would of been behind the enemy jungler. Going back to my original point, Diamond's error of leaving top lane at the beginning of the game left Cabochard wide open for a gank, allowing Vizi to take a strong hold of top lane so Shaco can farm bottom lane mid-late game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TeemoJenkins","date":"2015-04-06T19:56:47.052+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"What's sad, the three threads within the last three days all have something in common: 0 Shaco games.  \"NERF CHAMP CUZ REASONS\".","replies":[]},{"poster":"JLaww","date":"2015-04-07T03:36:22.526+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Shaco basically only dominates the early game, and that's because of his ability to snowball lanes early or destroying the enemy jungler.

I've seen enough 10+ kill shacos solo carry the game in my day lol!  I guess most of my comfort comes from when I play mid, because I know that's the most likely lane for shaco to camp and I know I won't be the one feeding him.  I get a little more worried when I don't get mid because a lot of people don't seem to adjust their playstyle based on junglers for whatever reason... (stupidity?)\n\nI've never really struggled too much with a split pushing shaco unless he's several kills up from laning phase.  Seems pretty easy to shut down if you just upgrade your sweeper trinket.  Doesn't he have the lowest base HP in the game? Or is that Sona?

What caused Shaco to be able to dominate the split push and almost 1 shot EZ is that his lanes won on their own for the most part.  He got top snowballing, but after that he just farmed up split pushing and didn't have kill participation until after they were on the inhibs.\n\nWhat that game showed, just like with any other champ, is that if the team as a whole is doing good then you will too.
