We're not planning any brand new features at _launch_, but new League features are always in development and will get added to the updated client when they launch.\n* All queues will get added over the course of the alpha, but we started with ARAM and SR blind pick since these are the \"safest\" tech-wise to start with as we put the updated client tech through its paces.\n* We designed the client's visual & audio with 2 key goals in mind: (1) a consistent visual & audio style (hextech UI) to the client that _feels_ true to League as it is today, and (2) a clean, intuitive interface that any Riot dev team can extend and adapt to fit with new League features in the future.

I guess the new ARAM champion select won&#x27;t hit the Legacy client because is too much effort to maintain 2 versions of the same feature.\n\nHey! Let me pick up the tech portion of your question. It's a really good callout, because while we're eager to get the updated client out to folks we definitely don't want to disrupt anyone who is playing on the legacy client.\n\nTo achieve this, we put a lot of care into making sure that the updated client  and the legacy client can speak the same language - so chat messages, statuses, invites and all that other good stuff can move between both clients freely without either one getting confused.","replies":[{"poster":"sparkly unicorns","date":"2016-05-20T20:24:05.700+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> To achieve this, we put a lot of care into making sure that the updated client and the legacy client can speak the same language\n\nAh, thanks for mentioning that. Yes - both clients are completely interoperable as we haven't changed the platform protocols that they use to talk to our servers.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Y0ungSavage","date":"2016-05-21T01:15:31.122+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can you guys show our mmr again on our profile?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pool Sea","date":"2016-05-20T20:13:59.404+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey guys.\n\nI'm wondering if chat will be a part of this update.

But seriously, we'll be adding these features one by one to the alpha to get focused feedback on them. We'll be updating the [**alpha site**](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/client-update/news) with future testing areas so stay tuned.","replies":[{"poster":"The Potato Man","date":"2016-05-20T21:33:43.052+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you!\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}]}]}]}
