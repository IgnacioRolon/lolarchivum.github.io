{"poster":"CapnBranFlakes","date":"2016-06-16T23:59:01.485+0000","title":"A follow-up on the \"Offline Status\" feature request","subforum":"Dev Corner","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey all, \r\n\r\nWe've been seeing some passionate responses to [our note yesterday about addressing requests for an \"appear offline\" or \"invisible\" mode on the friends list](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/alpha-client-discussion/gOohi2F5-offline-status-for-new-client?comment=0002000b). We should reiterate that our main goal right now is getting the League client update to feature parity with the legacy client (aka NOT developing whole new features), but we wanted to talk about this more in depth.\r\n\r\nOur official line on an invisible mode boiled down to \"we're researching it to learn more!\" The community's response was \"what's there to learn? We're telling you we want it, so why do you have to do research?\" \r\n\r\nFirst of all, \"research\" can mean that we want to investigate impact of a feature on a global level. It's also sometimes just shorthand for \"scoping out the work.\" To deliver a chat invisibility feature, we'd have to answer some nitty-gritty questions about how exactly an invisible mode would work in practice before we prototyped the feature. Questions like:\r\n\r\n* Could invisible players see and chat with friends? What about in clubs?\r\n* Once a chat is initiated, would friends in a chat still see the invisible player as offline? \r\n* Could you be invisible on the League Friends mobile app?\r\n* Could invisible players receive mobile notifications (ex: messages, friend requests) while invisible?\r\n* Could invisible players selectively invite friends to lobbies? Can they be invited to lobbies by friends?\r\n* Friends can see your match history and that you were playing games—is that something we'd be cool with?\r\n\r\nThese are just a few things we wanted to think through. But we want to dig deeper into this to address the community discussion on this topic. So let's spitball for a minute here and talk about one potential solution we're considering: turning the \"away\" mode into a more reliable way to get some privacy when you want it. \r\n\r\nCurrently, the \"away\" mode in the friends list isn't particularly reliable. Interacting with the client or other programs can easily knock you back into regular \"online\" status. If you play a game or spectate someone while in away mode, everyone on your friends list sees what you're doing and is free to chat with you. \"You can't hide from me,\" your always-online friend says. \"Why don't you want to duo anymore?\"\r\n\r\nWhat if we changed that? What if switching to away mode meant that nobody could see when you were in game or spectating? You could still chat with friends or play with people as you wanted, but you'd have a layer of privacy to protect you when you want to go solo. \r\n\r\nAgain, we're just spitballing here, not making promises (our focus is SERIOUSLY on feature parity in the client update). But we want to know what players would think about that as a possible stopgap solution. What potential problems would you foresee? What would you want us to avoid?","replies":[{"poster":"BiII","date":"2016-06-17T01:49:34.129+0000","up_votes":55,"down_votes":129,"body":"Oh fuck off; these responses are such bullshit.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Cactopus","date":"2016-06-17T01:56:32.344+0000","up_votes":132,"down_votes":19,"body":"Lol Bill, how's your day going man","replies":[{"poster":"Hyper10sion","date":"2016-06-17T03:40:39.623+0000","up_votes":27,"down_votes":2,"body":"Cactopus with the classy response","replies":[{"poster":"A Liberal","date":"2016-06-28T04:09:28.241+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cactopus is my favorite rioter.\n\nI hope Nidalee get's a plant inspired skin and it's called Cactopus Nidalee","replies":[{"poster":"Amusette","date":"2017-11-02T16:40:26.397+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=A Liberal,realm=NA,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=RbKEr7TQ,comment-id=000a000000000001,timestamp=2016-06-28T04:09:28.241+0000)\n>\n> Cactopus is my favorite rioter.\n> \n> I hope Nidalee get&#x27;s a plant inspired skin and it&#x27;s called Cactopus Nidalee\n\nOr a sea inspired theme with the name: Octopussy.... 0:-)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Furry Degenerate","date":"2016-06-17T04:52:01.693+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":2,"body":"Queue classroom \"oooooooooh\" sounds!","replies":[{"poster":"Alexiterio","date":"2016-06-17T05:58:12.252+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":0,"body":"(You're looking for the homophone, \"cue.\")","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Cactopus","date":"2016-06-17T06:39:23.520+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":1,"body":"TIL","replies":[]},{"poster":"Not Based","date":"2016-06-17T06:50:57.736+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're a homophone","replies":[{"poster":"yunh9055","date":"2016-06-17T07:47:28.419+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"cue classroom \"oooooooo\" sounds","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"AMYS GRAVE","date":"2016-06-17T18:46:52.734+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"or he means put the \"ooooooooooh\" sounds in the sound queue, to be played after other sounds such as Bill's whining.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ShadyGecko","date":"2016-06-17T15:33:48.921+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahh, classic Bill.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"LankPants","date":"2016-06-17T00:19:36.127+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":4,"body":">Could invisible players see and chat with friends?

What about in clubs?\n\n> Once a chat is initiated, would friends in a chat still see the invisible player as offline?\n\nOnce you interact with a club or friend while invisible, that club or friend sees your status as \"invisible\" -- not offline -- until you stop talking/interacting.\n\nFor example: You're invisible and you:\n\n* Send a message to a friend.  Your friend now sees you as \"invisible\".  She then messages you for the next few minutes, but you don't say anything back, and your status turns back to \"offline\" for her, even if you're still logged in as invisible and reading all of her messages.\n\n* You send a message to your Club.  Everyone in that club sees you as \"invisible\" for the next few minutes, even if they're not your friend.  Before your status changes back to \"offline\", a non-friend Club member invites you to a match, and you accept -- since you interacted with THAT PERSON, they see you as \"invisible\" for the next few minutes, even though the rest of the Club sees you as \"offline\" after the timer expires.\n\n* You play a game.  It doesn't show up on your profile *until you stop being \"offline\" to the person checking it* (e.g. you interact with that person, thus temporarily changing your status to \"invisible\").  \n\nAm I missing any possible cases?","replies":[{"poster":"Kiharon","date":"2016-06-17T04:31:01.861+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your last point seems like it would require too much work for not that much gain.  Right off hand, I can think of a few issues that would need tackled:\n\n* The system must now track for whom a game is visible where currently it does not.  Offhand, I expect this to be a non-trivial amount of required storage.\n* This has potential to make all games for a person never be visible in their history.  This would happen if it is possible to log in as 'offline', rather than having the select it after logging in.  This would be counter to the existing stance that all ranked game history is public knowledge.\n* What happens when A and B play together, but A is 'online' and B is 'offline' to C?  Would the match show up only when viewing A's profile but not B's?  Would it not show up at all? Would it show up on both profiles because C had 'visibility' into the game?\n\nBesides the impact it has on the system, this solution only delays the problem of the friend finding out you \"played without them\".  Long term, you still end up showing that you played a game if someone really wants to check timestamps.  Personally, I think we should be able to be mature enough to accept that someone wanted to play solo/without us rather than trying to hide matches we played without them.","replies":[{"poster":"Fear Not","date":"2016-06-18T00:24:37.331+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I suggested that under the premise that the \"invisible\" option is to hide that you're playing RIGHT NOW, not to hide the fact that you've ever played.","replies":[{"poster":"Kiharon","date":"2016-06-18T01:07:16.172+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah, a misunderstanding then.

Some people get butthurt if they think you are avoiding them, when really you may just have the client open and looking at god knows whatever else in another window (or for people like myself, on another monitor entirely). You seem to already know this though, as you made the exact same reference in your OP.\n\n>To deliver a chat invisibility feature, we'd have to answer some nitty-gritty questions about how exactly an invisible mode would work in practice before we prototyped the feature.\n\nNeed an example that is functional? Xbox live has this exact feature. I mean, it has since the early days of the 360. Appear offline means you appear Offline. If you initiate the message, they can see the message and message back, but if they look in their friends list it says \"Offline.\" If you are in a party, everyone can hear you and see you in the party, but if they look next to your name, it will say \"Offline\". If you happen to stumble upon them in matchmaking, they can see and interact with you in game, but to them your profile will say \"Offline\". If they are a stalker and watch your gamer score and play times of your games to watch for any changes, they will see the changes, but your profile will still appear as \"Offline\". \n\nSteam has literally the exact same feature. It works literally the exact same way. I honestly don't think it has a single difference in how it works. Been there since I downloaded it years before league was a game. Never once have I heard a complaint about it that was founded in reality.\n\nHonestly, marking as offline has kind of been the universal sign to leave someone alone. You can leave a message, but don't expect an instant response. You can invite someone to a game/party, but you shouldn't expect them to join. If someone *does* expect these things, then they should probably be removed/blocked, as that shit is literally the definition of an abusive relationship.

Generally message receiving is a separate option. Showing offline just makes you superfically appear offline. It doesn't have to restrict functionality too. You still receive everything.\n\n>Could invisible players selectively invite friends to lobbies? Can they be invited to lobbies by friends?\n\nYes, probably yes. You can invite anyone, and they can invite you without any feedback that the invite worked and without anything that actually prompts them to invite. Theoretically, you can disallow them inviting you. There's a bit of a gray area there, but either way, it's not really important. You can make a totally arbitrary decision here and it is unlikely to make a significant difference in player experience.\n\n>Friends can see your match history and that you were playing games—is that something we'd be cool with?\n\nThis is a downside that only exists if you're trying to avoid someone, in which case you'd have the same issue if you were trying to avoid them without the system. You could consider a private match history, but really, you should be considering that independently of the \"appear offline\" system. That should exist anyway.\n\n>What if switching to away mode meant that nobody could see when you were in game or spectating? You could still chat with friends or play with people as you wanted, \n\nI can chat with friends or play with people if you let me appear offline too. I just have to choose that I want to, whereas \"away\" still advertises that I'm here and deliberately avoiding them. If I don't want to play with other people, I'd really just rather not tell them I'm here at all. It seems like a strictly worse option.\n\nFinal point: You don't need to reinvent the wheel here. You're not going to do much better than a standard \"appear offline\" function. We've been doing this for long enough that all we really want from the communication system is for it to function in the same way every other system functions. Just do what Skype and Steam do.

They should be able to invite but not be invited. You should be able to be invisible on mobile. The match history is a little tricky. I don't think it's a big enough priority to have to create some sort of system where your match history is invisible, more important things to tackle first. Like how awful the rune thing is right now. Why is it automatically chosen that I can see runes I've already bought? Why do I automatically see tier 2 runes even though I'm level 30? Why does the order go Mark > Glyph > Seal when rune pages are set up Mark > Seal > Glyph? Fixing those 3 small things would really fix that. Level 10-20 should auto see tier 2, and above Level 20's should auto see tier 3 runes. It should be auto checked to NOT show owned runes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Argon","date":"2016-06-17T03:24:30.125+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly, from what I've seen from player comments, making a more reliable \"away\" or \"busy\" option that does not change until turned off by the user would be a huge improvement from the current system and should address some of the issues of why people want invisible mode. Users could remain \"away\" or \"busy\" and play games without other people bothering them (talking or inviting to a game) while the user still being able to communicate with friends/clubs. I'm not sure how much work this change would require, but it is probably more feasible than creating an invisibility mode with less kinks to work out.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheCups","date":"2016-06-17T04:13:04.764+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ask your boss at Tencent, their communication software QQ has an invisible mode and it has all the answers to your questions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ƒlash","date":"2019-08-26T23:03:42.995+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's been 3 years.... hurry the hell up.
