If you&#039;ve got an iOS device, you&#039;ll still be able to get the regular version of the app as soon as it&#039;s available.\n\n**Q: Can I give my invite to a friend?**\nA: No, sharing the link doesn&rsquo;t forward the invite. Only players who received an emailed invite from us will be able to sign into the beta app and participate in the test.\n\n**Q: How long does beta last / when is the live launch?**\nA: We don&rsquo;t have an exact date right now, but if all goes well, we&rsquo;re looking at a few weeks to a month, or so. We&rsquo;ll be squashing bugs, ensuring stability, and listening for beta tester&rsquo;s feedback before we launch. \n\n**Q: Lots of regions will get the app once it&rsquo;s ready for release, right?**\nA: Yep, the League Friends app is launching in all League of Legends regions except for China and Southeast Asia. We&rsquo;ll roll it out to NA and OCE first, followed by the rest of the regions over the following weeks after that if everything goes smooth.\n\n**Q: What OS versions does the app work with?**\nA: The app works with devices using iOS 8.3 or newer or Android 4.1.1 or newer (API 16). \n\n**Q: No Windows Phone version?**\nA: No Windows Phone version. Basically, there just aren&#039;t enough League players with Windows Phones to justify supporting the app on an ongoing basis. \n\n**Q: If I&rsquo;m in the beta, where can I leave feedback and report bugs?**\nA: Bugs reports can be submitted through the app, as can feedback&mdash;go to the settings tab and select &quot;Bugs and Feedback.&quot; Discussions about the beta can be held on the [NA ](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/mobile-app-discussion)mobile app discussion board.","replies":[{"poster":"Tahngarthor","date":"2016-01-22T19:24:49.563+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":4,"body":"I'm sick of the \"there's not enough windows phone users\" excuse to not make a windows phone app. The SINGULAR REASON windows phone isn't doing as well as the others is the LACK OF WELL KNOWN APP SUPPORT. Almost anyone who's used all three phones will tell you that the core functionality of a WP10 is superior to that of the others. The only thing the other platforms have is far more third party apps. \n\nThis is a simple case of \"If you build it, they will come.\"  Of course, riot isn't famous for taking risks. That's why they never made a dominion ranked queue, or made 3v3 tournaments, or made other maps for the same game modes (other than 3v3 \"Classic\"), or create substantially meta changing champion designs (Think Cho'gall the 2-player hero or the three-heroes-in-one Lost Vikings in HotS)\n\nIf you build it, they will come.","replies":[{"poster":"Cs Jackpot","date":"2016-01-23T23:02:20.650+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":2,"body":"Upvote this pls! {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"AdminAnonymous","date":"2016-01-24T23:04:47.933+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> Q: No Windows Phone version?\nA: No Windows Phone version.
