Tilting is when you become aggravated by your own play, your teammates play, how they talk in chat, the losing streak your on, the pressure because you're in your series and want to win more. All of these are factors into putting you on tilt. This is natural, you are playing ranked, you want to win, however lets think about this for a second. Why do we all play League of Legends? Personally I play because it is a fun game, I really do love playing this game, it is NOT my job, I can't go to reddit and find someone breaking down every mistake I made in my last game. It is something I play FOR FUN. Obviously if you're looking at this post you aren't a big streamer (no big streamer rages because it is bad for viewer count, therefore bad for bank account), you aren't an LCS pro, hell you probably aren't much higher than Gold. So this game really doesn't hurt you at all if you do poorly. So just relax, you are playing for fun, enjoy the game, laugh when you misplay and die, because it was probably funny, if you get outplayed admit it, don't go into all chat blaming the fact that the champ is broken, because there are actually no broken champs in the game, everything has ways to counter play, cooldowns you can abuse, skillshots you should dodge, CC you should use on them. Honestly the biggest thing I see is people blaming the champ, don't every death of yours comes from a mistake YOU made, either not warding (those of you complaining about getting camped), or not understanding your oppositions damage output.\r\n\r\nOkay now we can move to the pressure we feel to have a good rank, I ended preseason in gold 5, because of MY poor play in placements got placed bronze 3 and took a break from ranked to fix my mechanics, and when I returned I felt no pressure to do well, not because I didn't care but because I had reestablished my mindset that let me climb from Bronze 1 at the end of S4 to Gold 5 at the end of preseason, which is actually very simple. The mindset is that IT DOES NOT MATTER. Honestly until you are challenger NOBODY cares about your rank, I have sat at 100 viewers on twitch when I was level 25-30 learning the games basics just having fun. That means 100 people were watching me basically wander the map going \"What am I doing? IDK do something, oh I died.\"\r\n\r\n I will use an analogy from LastShadow9, the current coach for Gravity, former coach for Supa Hot Crew. On his stream he drew 2 different piles of poop, one with corn, one without and asked the guy he was coaching to compare the two. The guy began saying \"Well one has corn in it and...\" LS cut him off saying \"Why does it matter, it is still a pile of crap you are comparing? Now until you reach challegner/master tier, that is all you are doing when you are comparing ranks, comparing crap to crap with corn.\" Now honestly tell me the difference between ranks? Silver/Gold, a bit of mechanics as well as game knowledge, more corn. According to MMR the difference between G5 and S3 is roughly 70 MMR, that is a win streak. For example I have seen many times someone in S5 (typically 0 LP but that is irrelevant) laughing or talking down to someone in Bronze 1, so I went to na.op.gg and compared the 2 players MMR, the difference was 13, their MMR score was 13 different, like are you really talking down to someone because you had a win streak before they did? We are so focused on rank, who cares, just enjoy the game, improve, have fun, laugh at your mistakes, learn from them, and keep in mind this is a GAME, it isn't a job, you can do bad and still pay your bills.\r\n\r\n\r\nI hope this helps all of my fellow summoners. Links to LastShadow9 will be at the bottom, I really do recommend watching his YT videos, if you have questions try tweeting him, pay for his coaching (I believe he still offers it now that he is in NA). Best of luckto everyone. If you have any other tips, or want to discuss something please comment below I will try to check this thread daily.\r\n\r\n\r\nLastShadow Links:\r\n\r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/LSXYZ9\r\n\r\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/lastshadow9\r\n\r\nTwitch: http://www.twitch.tv/imls","replies":[{"poster":"Keisto","date":"2015-02-23T05:28:14.909+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Welp, since this post is more or less deserted, I'll try to help by giving my two cents.\n\nA little background on myself: I've been playing since the beginning of Season 2 and have raked up a total of about 2.870 hours on League of Legends which means 120 days of my life {[Source](https://wastedonlol.com/na-AfroWairus/)}. I peaked Platinum 2 last season, finishing Plat 4 and starting this season Gold 5, currently Gold 4 with the end goal being high diamond/challenger by the end of S5. \n\nI'd like to start by saying that it needs to be understood that a good balance is necessary between being competitively motivated and having a mindset of where you are doesn't matter. Of course, much like anything else in life, there is a large dependency on the person in question, for example; I enjoy the corn-poop analogy a lot because it's a source of motivation- I don't want to be corn-poop any longer, but I know a fair share of people who'd get discouraged that they are the equivalent poop with corn bits. \n\nRanked can be a touchy subject when it comes to attitude mostly because 4 other people will be around to affect you. Mute buttons and the removal of all chat help tremendously in keeping a level-headed mind, but a thick skin will need to be developed regardless (Slightly off topic rant: There seems to be a lack of foresight in the community in regards to patterns- ie: getting mad at people when they rage as if a ragey individual is something uncommon among games. I had a few other points, but they sounded too rambley so I cut 'em). Bringing it back to my point of a good balanced mindset, I think that League of Legends should be approached very much as a single player game with a team game aspect that should just sit in the back of your head, meaning that if you would like to improve, you must focus every detail of the game onto yourself (in any given situation, there is always something better you could have done and everything is your fault. Main point: **FIND SOLUTIONS** instead of complaining). Do this while maintaining a team aspect, as in, you must work with your team to win, regardless of how incompetent you may believe they are. Something that isn't considered in most any ELOs is that you must work around how your team plays, don't get me wrong, you can set the pace of the game, but don't make the common mistake of thinking that your teammates are on the same wavelength as you  (Scenario: You see 2 enemies in a primed situation to be killed, but you know that the help of a teammate is necessary- so without hesitation you rush in with the belief that your teammate has the same idea as you, but instead he began to walk off right as you darted off towards the enemies- immediately getting frustrated when your teammate was too dumb to help you. Here's the thing, regardless of how dumb you think your teammates are, just keep it to yourself and follow the flow of the game- if your teammate isn't going in, neither can you, because that's just how it is going to be).\n\nEesh, that was so filled with verbal diarrhea and tired nonsense, but that's a little bit of what I've gotta say.\n\n**Key Points:** Be introspective of your play style, don't be stagnant with your play style by finding solutions to common problems you have and go with the flow of your team's mindset because you are the only person that you can control in that game (understand this well).\n\nSorry again if that was rough to get through.\n\n------\n\nBest of luck on the Rift,\nAfroWairus","replies":[{"poster":"FedAsFuk","date":"2015-02-23T06:23:16.675+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I disagree with the thick skin part, I can honestly not give a crap what anyone says about me, example I played college baseball had a rough couple of weeks in an important part of the season and the local media was basically sending the town on a witch hunt for me, and it didn't affect me. I mute players because of the fact their complaining/negativity is taking away from my ENJOYMENT. Honestly if you can't take someone saying something bad about you the internet is not the place for you.\n\nAs for the scenario where the teammate walks away, I agree that is 100% your fault, he may not have seen you going in however you have the same minimap he does, and can clearly see him walking away.\n\nOne last touch on the thick skin thing, this again is just for me, if you (reader not poster above) have any issue with someone bad mouthing you and it actually affects you on an emotional level (not just wow that's ruining my fun) then by all means mute him, don't tell him you are because that just causes infighting as well as drama, and you want to find the solution that works for you, not cause more drama.\n\n\nThank you for this very long post by the way, it took a couple reads to get through some sections but other than that it has to help someone. Also was not saying don't care about your ranked games, just that in perspective to other things LoL is rather unimportant and something we do for fun, so do try to enjoy it....without building AP Garen.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"turtlecoon","date":"2015-02-23T11:52:57.670+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"gaining elo easy ok\n\nstep 1 pick a champ to play for the rest of your life\nstep 2 look up masters/challengers in each region who main said champion on op.gg\nstep 3 copy their runes and masteries\nstep 4 for every few games you play, go on op.gg and watch a replay of the masters/challengers playing your champ\nstep 5 repeat for a month\nstep 6 wow elo\n\nsource: i have many much elo","replies":[]}]}
