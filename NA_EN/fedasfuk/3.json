I will try to go into a custom and see if it can be repeated but since I was running at around 240 FPS before Sona frame kill then on 4 FPS after whichever ability I would be amazed if it was related to my PC. Is anyone else experiencing  a similar issue? \r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE: All updates were checked between games and almost 2 hours passed between the games. \r\n\r\nNOTE 2: I believe it is Sona related because of a few things. 1) When Sona died I never ONCE in EITHER GAME experienced any frame dropping. 2) I asked her to use Q then W then E each 10 seconds apart once she respawned and my frames tanked (217 FPS down to 11 FPS) but because of the severity of the lag I could not tell which ability caused it (she was NOT visible on my screen).\r\n\r\nAs I stated I am going to try and test this out later and will hopefully post a video to it (not sure I want to upload to my channel research Riot should be able to do themselves) but regardless will add more details when I have tested this theory, if you are able to test it and can record/upload do so if you please.","replies":[{"poster":"Eambo","date":"2014-12-07T02:51:09.656+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi GG Mezzie,\n\nThis is a known issue I believe, but it's something that should be reported in the Bug Reports forum:\n\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report\n\nGenerally from what I've seen Sona's first Q in a game will cause a minor freeze/lagspike, then it clears up from there.","replies":[{"poster":"FedAsFuk","date":"2014-12-07T21:20:20.369+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Link to an unrelated issue. I asked Sona to use her abilities 10 seconds apart starting at either 26:30 or 36:30, also if you would have read the post and not the title there are about 8 points that would have atleast hinted that it was not the first Q only","replies":[]}]}]}
