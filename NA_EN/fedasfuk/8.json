I have been playing LoL for a year now. I currently have 1 account in gold and one in promos to gold, and this ugly redheaded step child of an account. I have coached 2 different teams, one I believe is currently in plat for ranked 5s, the other I have no contact with anymore and couldn't even tell you if they even play anymore. I also coach about a dozen players of various skill levels in all roles, although only a few of them actively seek help. Which brings me to my point of the post. I enjoy coaching and helping people and feel I can add a few more to the list I am currently helping.\r\n\r\nSo if you want coaching there are a few requirements to consider before adding me or commenting below.\r\n\r\n1. You will take the initiative to ask for help. I am currently going to college, working and have my own life, so I will not ask you to help you.\r\n\r\n2. There will be sessions. I will answer questions you have when I can but this is something for you to IMPROVE. So if you can't record a gameplay and devote 1-2 hours to go over every part of your gameplay. \r\n\r\n3. Respect me as well as anyone I may bring in to help with specific things (Example I have a friend who mains Annie where I know very little about Annie, so I bring him in alot for Annie gameplays).\r\n\r\n4. No racism. This has already happened multiple times this season, racism towards me or other students results in immediate removal.\r\n\r\n5. Don't be sensitive. This means I am going to point out very bluntly every mistake. If you can't handle that then I suggest another coach. I swear, when you do something dumb I will tell you \"that was f***ing stupid\". It isn't to be rude or be a dick, it is purely to improve your play. \r\n\r\n6. Another instance that has happened is arguing over something, now while most things should be discussed, especially the reason behind why you thought it was good and why it may have not been good/as good as it could have been, arguing because you don't want to be wrong is not something I will do. I make mistakes, I misplay, everyone does things wrong, however getting frustrated and defensive when they are pointed out is not a way to improve.\r\n\r\n7. Respect the fact I play too. Another recent issue leading to the end of a student being coached is simple, I play this game to, I play soloQ, with friends, just alone for a break. I don't mind helping, I enjoy it however there is a line between asking for help and actually being a pest, this is a very rare thing as it is the first time it has happened but I felt it should be listed. As an example he would message me 20-25 times while I am in a game asking to play/when can I play, regardless of anything I am doing.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow if you can handle these simple rules feel free to contact me in game or leave a comment below. I try to be professional in all coaching sessions and ask you to do the same. Good luck and have fun summoners.","replies":[{"poster":"ForsakenOokami","date":"2015-03-05T23:03:39.199+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello, my name is cam and my ranked team is looking for a coach to coach our team. my current rank is diamond 5, and my team's rank is Gold 3 and we arent doing anything but going up. our team is looking for a coach or analyst to help our team through picks and bans, inndividual gameplay, and anything that you can bring to the table. we are a legit ranked team looking to achieve diamond this season and maybe higher, would love to have you on our team.

I am pretty new...only played one normal pvp match. So if that's not too daunting a task, I would love to.
