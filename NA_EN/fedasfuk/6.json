Jungle tax. Let's start by defining jungle tax, it is the act of taking 1-3 minions for a successful gank.\n\nDo's: \n\n-Tax for successful ganks. Blowing a major summoner (flash ideally, TP, basically anything that isn't a 2 minute CD)\n\n-Take 1-3 minions for your time investment if you do NOT get the kill.\n\n-Ask if your laner dies if they want you to shove or freeze (if lane is freezeable)\n\n-If laner asks you to freeze ONLY last hit the minions. \n\n-Generally you are safe to push the wave into tower, however if your laner pings you to stop, just last hit until they are back into lane (no point in wasting xp and gold).\n\nDon'ts:\n\n-Tax the cannon minion, that is 50 gold, essentially the same gold you would get from taxing 1-3 minions. This actually hurts your laner.\n\n-Tax without a successful gank, this only hurts your lane especially if they are even/a little ahead, you were most likely already getting xp setting them back on experience and depending on timing that could really hurt the lane (usually pre 6 taking xp is potentially a death sentence).\n\n-Tax when you take the kill. You just earned 200 gold and xp for a kill, do not deny your laner gold unless they need help pushing the wave to tower. Then you are not taxing but pushing (a difference ignored far too much).\n\n-Push the lane when your laner asks (or pings danger when you try to push). Usually this means they need/want to freeze. Keep in mind a frozen lane also forces the enemy to extend more, giving you a return gank opportunity. \n\n-Tax more than 3 minions, this is something I see very often at lower elo, JGs taxing a full wave. When you do that not only did you share xp (helping you out and hurting the lane slightly) you have taken 21x3+3x19+40(+0.5 gold per 90 seconds of game timer, according to LoLWikia). Meaning you just took 63+ 57+40= 160 gold. That is nearly the total of a kill, so if you tax a full wave and gave your lane a kill you essentially wiped the advantage you gave.\n\n-Do NOT tax a losing lane, even if you successfully gank. The lane is behind and hurting, do not take more xp than absolutely necessary and definitely do not take gold that they so desperately need.\n\n\nThese are my general concepts for taxing as a jungler. I know alot of things were restated, primarily to try to emphasize the point. Comment below anything you think I missed or didn't explain properly.","replies":[{"poster":"Faith Breaker","date":"2015-02-28T23:53:51.835+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've had junglers come out of the bush/river and just starting \"taxing\" cs.

How do you expect your jungler to gank, or gank well, if they are 3 lvls behind? Plus donating cs to help your jungler means they're probably gonna gank you first when are able to, and are gonna generously commit to it. \n\nBut sometimes they won't take the cs. I'll even ask them if they'd like me to leave lane and help them with gromp, but sometimes I think it's pride maybe? A jungler won't take my help, or maybe they've been chewed out before for taxing and have grown reluctant or not willing to do so.

But it's also not all up to the jungler, it's also his or her laner's responsibility to also be aware of when it is healthy and when it isn't and to allow or remind the jungler of such.

You have 2 guys with more equal gear, meaning that if one dies the whole plan doesn't go to shit because holy crap they focused the guy with the armor and sword now what do I do. It is very little about being behind but more of sharing the wealth. This is a team game, if as whole the team is stronger, it benefits everyone. If you are just a little bit stronger, more depends on you never dying.

Also viable if the enemy laner is a champion who has trouble last hitting under tower to some extent.\nIf all you do is make them burn a summoner without putting them in a passive position (ie low enough that they can be easily zoned) or making them back, taking exp will only make your ally vulnerable when the enemy gets a temporarily level advantage.\nThis isn't limited to riven. Any toplaner who has kill potential can easily all in you at 6 when you`re 5 because your jungler sapped exp.\nAt higher elos people will push whatever advantage they can, people know how to play aggro.\n\nThere is no correct time to tax for the sake of taxing.","replies":[{"poster":"FedAsFuk","date":"2015-03-01T02:04:00.482+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Where in this does it say tax to tax?

If that 64 gold is worth setting your laner behind you should probably stop junging and learn how to win.\n\nThought I would throw this in since I am reading other comments. If it is, as you stated a TEAM game and the TEAM would benefit from more people being ahead, smaller leads individually but more people ahead, why exactly are you against a JG taxing? Thinking purely off the xp and gold from an assist you would expect to be 2 camps up from the enemy JG. Now given that ganks rarely take less than 20 seconds, you can expect that by around level 4 the enemy JG to clear a camp and begin the next one in roughly 8 seconds. Now that is 16 seconds+ walk time(say 4 seconds for simple math) so 20 seconds total. Now factor in a gank typically has a set up time 5-10 seconds the actual gank another 5 seconds, time for tax +5 seconds and then the walk to the nearest not cleared camp, say top lane gank Golems would likely have been cleared before the gank leaving raptors up possibly wolves? Cannot depend on counter JG as you don't know what was cleared in the past minute or where the enemy is. Now adding all that together you get 10 for set up 5 for gank 5 for tax and probably another 8-10 to get to a camp you can clear, 28-30 seconds, well that would put you about 3 camps behind, where as you gained from the assist and XP from kill MAYBE 2 camps of xp.\n\nAll the math aside, you argue for the team factor, which is true this is a team game. However is the jungler not part of the team? Is them being ahead not also beneficial? Yes gold on laners is nice, however you now have xp and gold advantage as laner, you should be fine without JG assistance, meaning while you snowball he no longer gets that assist and XP from kill because you can now solo kill or 2v2 in bot lanes case, meaning now that he is equal footing to the enemy JG your team now has a glaring weakspot. The jungler doesn't have the money to buy the items he needs, so maybe instead of front lining like he may have been capable of with a small gold boost he dies and the fight goes a little bit sideways. Ganks are to put the TEAM ahead, as long as the jungler is on the team he should receive more reward than \"ok you can be at the same spot had you kept power farming\".\n\n\nApologies if this came off as condescending or anything I just really fail to see why people are so against letting the jungler tax. Yes some JGs tax too much, some just leech XP, some don't tax and fall behind. If we can get more JGs to tax to an acceptable level for laners (to not set them behind, IE taking a cannon and 2 more creeps) there is actually no VALID issue to be against taxing. Atleast not that I can see, again there are specific exceptions, however this is a general guide and not a law, there are times where the general rule is wrong, it is great you pointed some of those out. But I do feelt he need to reiterate I apologize for coming off as hostile, it had little to do with the posts on the board but the in game messages I was getting from people who...failed to understand this as a general guide or took me as someone they could rant to about their JG taxing ruined their lane.\n\n\n\nPOST EDIT: Failed to comment on the fact \"junglers are junglers because they can do well on less gold\"\n\nYes there is some truth to this, however if they can survive on less gold, wouldn't throwing them 63 gold be like showering them in wealth? Think about the time the JG spent waiting in the bush to gank for you, he probably could have cleared atleast one camp in that time, tax is not only for successful ganks but think of it as a thank you for time invested previously when a gank didn't work (no gold went to the JG because of flash or laner backed or just a good escape by the enemy) that was also timed invested where they weren't gaining gold, not necessarily because their own play, you might have misplayed the set up, you might not have cleared the bush of wards, you might have called for help when they were trying to back. All of these things happen in the course of a game, but it is all time/gold that the JG does not get back freely. This in my mind is the core behind the taxing system, not for the ganks where you got gold, but for when things didn't work for whatever reason, because when ganks don't work the JG just fell behind for no reason, now maybe he loses that 1v1 because he is down the last item component he was 100G short of.

So if as a laner I can sacrifice up to 3 minions to put my Jg ahead in gold and xp it is worth it. Does this mean there are times you should not take a tax? Absolutely and I feel I listed a fair amount if not all of the times (barring very specific things like we are both 2 minions short of 6 and if you take XP you signed a death warrant for me) but those come up maybe once a game.

ADCs, midlaners, and even most tops, yes even the tanky tops, can each take over an entire game if they play right.\n\nSo would you rather have two people be ahead, or have one person be fed and have an enemy shut down?","replies":[{"poster":"FedAsFuk","date":"2015-03-02T00:13:02.138+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"At the same time 63 gold (assuming you take 3 mellee minions) doesn't stop the laner from being fed, they have the ability to snowball the lane because of the +300 for the kill they just got an XP bonus.

Or in the course of the game say they tax each lane once, that's 180g, use that to invest into ward control for an objective. I have never seen a laner not snowball because of 60 gold, most laners when trying to shove a lane will miss 3 minions trying to put it into tower. I think the arguments against this are way overvaluing the 60 gold for a lane. You get a fresh 200ish gold every 30 seconds coming to you. The JG does not, especially considering about 10 minutes inot the game the mid lane will eat either wolves or raptors...hurting JG gold flow.\n\n\nAlso I direct you to another analogy I have made. rather have one guy in full plate armor and a big ass sword followed by someone in parts of a chain vest and a short sword or both in a plate chest with chain armor on their arms and legs with moderately sized swords. The point of this is it is less on one person to win the game, yes he is not as strong as he could be but he also has support, if he dies the fight can still go on.\n\n\nAlso with getting an assist you come out about equal on gold with the enemy JG, assuming they are farming (safe assumption most the time) but most ganks invest more time than camp clearing, so between time and gold the JG is actually slightly behind, the extra 63 gold is what makes a gank equal (assuming solo lane gank and not bot, bot 2 assists would put the ganking JG ahead by about 2 camps worth of xp and equal on gold).","replies":[]},{"poster":"FedAsFuk","date":"2015-03-02T00:10:21.897+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"At the same time 63 gold (assuming you take 3 mellee minions) doesn't stop the laner from being fed, they have the ability to snowball the lane because of the +300 for the kill they just got an XP bonus.

You might as well just shove the lane in that amount of time, if you are going to sit around waiting to last hit minions.\n\nI dont get it anyways. Unless you ran full speed into the lane, you probably leeched some xp sitting in the bush waiting to gank. So, then you sit around for another large chunk of time to last hit 3 minions, too?\n\nAgain, before you sit in a lane fighting for CS against someone who is probably goint to try and to last hit those same minions, you might as well just shove the wave into the turret.\n\nTaxing is dumb because its just a waste. You either shove the wave, or leave. I wouldnt even shove the wave unless the people you ganked died, or your laner needs to back. \n\nlol sitting around in a lane waiting to last hit minions, which means you are going to be fighting for the same CS against the laner, which means you might even make each other miss them.","replies":[{"poster":"FedAsFuk","date":"2015-03-01T11:02:18.330+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Assuming that you didn't time the gank in some miracle timing where no abilities touched minions they aren't going to be full HP, most likely 2-3 of them are going to be at the point where they can be last hit, taking those is what it is referring to.\n\nI really just don't see the point of your argument, you seem to simply restate taxing is dumb without providing actual reasons as to why you believe it is dumb? If you are waiting for an additional 15 seconds to hit 3 minions then you are probably brain dead, just because I said don't AA them to death (something that interferes with your laner) doesn't mean type /dance and wait. If by some miracle the minions are all healthy and you aren't pushing the wave yes then you shouldn't wait for 20 seconds to get 60ish gold.\n\nIf you believe that truly everytime you gank to take 3 minions without pushing the wave would take longer than 5 seconds you should probably submit a video because that is truly an amazing feat.

Also, again, at various points in the game, there are going to be open lanes you can go to. Mid roams? cover mid. Top backs? Cover top. Again, one of the biggest issues I see in my elo is junglers do not cover lanes.

These are all completely valid arguments, and I apologize I got a bit...agitated over people disagreeing, less the disagreeing but some of the phrasing for the disagreement. Back to the point, tax can be assumed additional income, sometimes you just are always in the wrong spot and can't cover lanes or eat that XP or gold. Sometimes your solos roam completely randomly, leaving you unable to predict \"I need to be here because they may roam and I wanna eat this wave if they do\".

The way I see it, depending on time invested to the gank you missed 2 or so camps, so giving you 63 gold and the assist gold actually keeps you on par with the enemy JG if they were power farming and cleared 2-4 camps (depending on game timers and clear speed and all kinds of things, most likely 2 camps though).

Push the wave to the turret so your laner can back or force the enemy to miss CS, but you shouldn't just be taking CS because you showed up to a lane and did your job.

Its not a gift from god that you ganked for someone; you are supposed to be doing that.\n\nAnd, half the time the lanes you ganked for, probably needed help. In what world does taking their farm make sense? Again, there are 3 reasons that you should ever take farm from the laner: to force the enemy to lose CS by pushing into the tower, to take the tower, or to let your laner get a back and have the lane reset. \n\nOr, just to watch a lane while they back, which honestly, tons of low elo junglers just fail to do, and then wonder why they suck or their towers are going down. It never fails that I see a jungler in my elo go do wolves or raptors while the enemy mid is beating on the turret with 2-3 waves of free cs and XP, when instead of doing wolves, he could be sitting there saving the turret, soaking up all that xp and gold. But no, afk jungle creeps and cry when a laner wants a buff.\n\nTaxing is just a stupid mindset, which honestly, is almost always going to do you more harm than good. Eventually, you are going to tax a guy who doesnt like it, and he will rage, and you will fight, and you will lose a game over trying to tax a lane when its not even necessary. If you want to potentially throw multiple games in rage infested low elo by taxing lanes, you go right ahead.

No because heaven forbid it offends the low elo players who think they saw bjergsen play Zed 5 times so they now are Zed masters.
