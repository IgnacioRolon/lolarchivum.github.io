All of these have happened on MULTIPLE accounts, after SEVERAL complete reinstalls of all league files, even one factory reset to help prove a point.\r\n\r\nMost recent (earlier today) I have received this AFK delay for the client, after 10 restarts never registering me as in a game. This means I went to the normal screen after login, with the play button at the top, while IN A GAME. It took me out of a team builder countdown, never showed a loading screen and just reset me as if someone had dodged, but when I tried to Q up it said I was in a game. After about 10 restarts it finally gives me the reconnect to game button, at which point it tells me I have no internet connection, which is odd as I am contacting riot support from that connection as this is all happening. \r\n\r\nI will be the first to admit the game I actually AFK&#039;d was the first one after signing the no AFK agreement (the game to sign agreement never let me connect), I had a family emergency, apologized to my team and left, fully expecting the low prio Q that I deserved, and never complained or said anything about it. Now the other several times I have had errors have been scattered but the trend seems to be after a patch and if I buy a skin from the store (example I just got SKT t1 Jax and todays issue happened). This I do not have proof of it is just speculation.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy other &quot;AFKs&quot; have been, 1 left to get laundry out of dryer (gone about 2 minutes, 20-30 seconds of I was dead), and my personal favorite is 4 times I could not connect to the game &quot;because I did not have internet connection&quot;, which is very odd because during 2 of them I was ACTIVELY STREAMING, and sent Riot the video of me streaming and live and interacting with the small chat I had all while their system is saying I &quot;had no internet connection&quot;. I do not want any special treatment or anything, I truly do not care if I again have to sit through 20 minutes per game for something I did not do, that is fine, I only ask that this system be FIXED. Exclude people who for some reason cannot connect, because they already wasted 20 minutes trying to rejoin the game (as I did today) to be told they now have to wait 5, 10 or 20 minutes before each game when they did nothing to violate the systems rules.","replies":[]}
