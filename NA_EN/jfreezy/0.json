But the one time I try using your fancy new client, I play a couple normals to make sure it's all good.\r\n\r\nI'm one win away from promos. So I queue up for ranked and get stuck in loading screen after champ select, it shows everyone loaded 100% except for the enemy jungler who was at 90% forever. Then it says I've been disconnected and I try logging back in and I'm just on my home page and I apparently got booted and lost LP. \r\n\r\nWow super fun. Great experience getting fucked by your new client that you spent 8 years on and losing LP to your technical issues. This season truly is a great indication of a players' ability when they can't even connect to the game and lose free LP for trying to.\r\n\r\nRefund my LP or I'm not playing ranked this year.","replies":[{"poster":"Jhin Sling","date":"2017-01-13T01:35:52.509+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"they don't care if u lose LP or not man cuz they give 0 fks abt u like every other player{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-04T23:09:44.829+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your issue appears to be happening after champion select and into the game, so it's independent of the client.  We can't alter LP or game stats, but I'd like to help get  this fixed.  It seems like your network is having problem holding communication with the game server, so it can't get through.  I recommend going through the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to troubleshoot that.  \n\nYou can also return to the legacy client if you don't want to test during this period:\n\n-  On the login screen of the open beta updated client, look for the \"Launch Legacy Client\" text at the bottom.\n-  Or create a shortcut directly to the legacy client in your League Installation. Just look for \"lol.launcher\"\n\nI hope it helps!","replies":[]}]}
