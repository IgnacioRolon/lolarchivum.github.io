Also i've got SEWN CHAOS ORIANNA skin as 70% discount from 1400 RP -> 420 RP. and also this skin originally priced as 520rp... and many other skins that are priced weird (not the standard 520, 750, 975, 1350, 1820, 3250, but weird 1400 or 1310 or 2230 etcetc)\r\n\r\nBasically the shop is over pricing the skins and discounting from the over priced RP value.\r\n\r\nIm not completely sure if this was intended or just glitched.\r\n\r\nNo idea how to attach the screenshot but yea, its so broken :/","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2017-05-19T16:00:38.186+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey! \n\nWe had several issues with Your Shop yesterday, all of which should be resolved now!

I also thought it was a bug but its more of a clarity issue. After you click on the skin that has a weird price u will see the information that the price includes the champion. So its not a bug.

Don't show the champion icon in the circle if the champ is already owned. It's a bit indirect, but if you see a mix of some with and some without, it could help players work out what that means.\n2. Indicate somewhere (without having to click) what you have. Skin name or skin name + champion. I actually found it a little odd in general that the names for the skins I was offered weren't readily available.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"quizotic","date":"2017-05-19T18:51:37.452+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm still having this issue with at least two of my skins.
