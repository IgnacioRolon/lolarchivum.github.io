The game was working fine two days ago, but now... not so much. =(\r\n\r\nI run the most recent version / update of Windows 10 (64bit)\r\nMouse: Logitech G600\r\nKeyboard: Logitech G510s\r\n\r\nI run the game in Borderless Window mode if that helps.\r\nI have dual Monitors and my mouse just moves freely between the two when the problem starts which is typically before the match starts sometimes a few seconds in. I've had my mouse \"move off\" the game screen in the past, but I could just alt + tab back into the windowed mode and it worked fine again.\r\n\r\nIf it helps my cursor goes from the typical \"gauntlet\" hand in LoL to the normal cursor pointer.\r\nI've restarted, rebooted, uninstalled and reinstalled the Logitech software a couple times.\r\nThis mouse and keyboard work fine on my other computer with league though, so it's not them as the culprit. =S\r\n\r\nAny help would be appreciated.\r\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-10T22:38:42.580+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmmm yea that sounds pretty odd. It seems like your keybinds might not be downloading or updating correctly on that specific pc, so it'd be worth trying to reset those manually really quickly.\n\n- Log into the game client\n- Navigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\\n- Delete the folder named **Config**\n- Go into a practice game and verify that settings have saved properly. \n- Leave game to sync settings","replies":[]},{"poster":"LuciousLamia","date":"2018-03-03T10:29:49.797+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same.
