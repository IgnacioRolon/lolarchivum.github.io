Can I see what offers did I had first time, please? I bought one skin from the second offer but I want to know if I can buy something from the first one too. Can you help me, please?","replies":[{"poster":"charles magic","date":"2017-09-21T03:46:57.333+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think so. The first time around I only opened 3 offers out of the 6 but really wanted one of them. I was using a hotspot on my phone and it died so i didnt finish opening them and then of course shop went down for a day. I submitted a ticket and they said the system shows that I never viewed the first 6 offers. My new offers suck too, ahri and morg who i literally have like 1 game on each.. Oh well maybe next year. Really wish I took a screenshot of that skin before I went to bed. Good luck if you do decide to submit a ticket","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-21T00:35:41.736+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you never opened the first set of offers then I don't believe they were ever actually created. Hit up our EU agents in a ticket and they'll be able to see if you opened the first offers or not and let you know what they were. After that, they can work with you to purchase any of the old offers if you wanted them.","replies":[]}]}
