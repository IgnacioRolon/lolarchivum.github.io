I generally prefer fiction (I kind of like YA novels, though I'll read anything if it holds still long enough), and I'm  leaning towards a series, simply because I read voraciously and it would take a bit longer to tackle. If you've got a great one-off to read, I'm open to suggestions for those too. \r\n\r\nThanks!","replies":[]}
