As you can imagine, I will not let this stand.\n\nWhile my gut instinct leans towards \"A rabble of koalas\", it's already taken by butterflies, those thieving bastards.\n\nSo instead, I found a petition for the name of \"A scuffle of koalas\". I find this acceptable. \n\nI need 17 more people to sign this petition, because how else will the world know how to describe a large uniform gathering of koalas?\n\nPlease, lend your signatures.\n\nFor the Koalas!\n\nhttps://www.causes.com/causes/522493-a-group-of-koalas-is-a-scuffle\n\nAnd here's a baby koala:\n\nhttp://cdn.cutestpaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/l-Just-a-baby-Koala.jpg\n\nThere's more where that's from, just keep the signatures flowing.\n\nUpdate: **4 MORE GUYS**","replies":[]}
