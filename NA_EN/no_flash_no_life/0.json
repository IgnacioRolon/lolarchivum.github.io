The question is how do I reply to it? Yes there is an area at the bottom for me to fill in a wall of text, and there's a add file or drop file here area, but I can't do anything after finishing my response. There is no Send button, no OK button, and the Submit button at the bottom isn't clickable. What now?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-28T03:25:24.578+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Straaaaaaaange.

I would go ahead and do that, but after trying out your second advice I found out that while firefox and IE browsers have the same problem, google chrome works just fine so I think I'll go ahead and use that for now.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
