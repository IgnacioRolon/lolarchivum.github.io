It's much, much easier to respond to a post that's got a couple of clear questions or points, than it is to respond properly to a two page long post that either covers a lot of different things or gets into a really detailed level of analysis. I do like responding to like stuff but usually only can when it's late in the evening and I've got a solid block of free time, rather than between meetings or other tasks at work ('what can I usefully respond to in 10 minutes?' being the common test). \n* Could lead to a positive conversation. Highly critical posts are fine of course (e.g. 'I'm really concerned about the changes to X champion and think it's a really bad approach for Y reasons'). Threads that start with things like 'WHAT THE **** IS WRONG WITH YOU RIOT YOU SHOULD ALL BE FIRED' though are much less likely to be a good use of posting time.\n* Aren't repeating something that's already been discussed a lot recently. I realize it's pretty hard to keep track of everything that gets discussed, I do feel there's a lot less value in repeating things we've recently talked about elsewhere.\n* Will be of interest to at least a moderately wide audience. \n\nThere are almost certainly some other factors I'm forgetting, that's the first list of stuff that leaps to mind though.","replies":[{"poster":"CrazedPorcupine","date":"2015-11-21T00:59:35.617+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Could you say your thoughts on the Current popularity of Guinsoo's Rageblade?
