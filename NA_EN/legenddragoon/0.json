Login doesn't go through. It gets stuck on \"Logging in\" or \"Authenticating\" (this happens sometimes, not the most frequent)\r\nwhen this happens I flush my DNS and restart which fixes it, but it's getting dumb).\r\n\r\nProblem 2. In champ select (I play draft mode) it'll get stuck on someone's pick and the timer counting down to 0 will stay at 0, and i'll just be stuck like that until I close it. I suffer with wait times now in the last 2 days including this happening in ranked.\r\nWhat I did to try and fix it, is again, to flush my DNS and restart my computer. (Extremely frustrating).\r\n\r\nProblem 3. After league crashes I can't reopen it. And if I do, problem 1 occurs.\r\nI have to restart my computer every. damn. time.\r\n\r\nI play other games on steam and such fine. Just League giving me trouble.\r\nAny help is GREATLY appreciated!\r\nThank you!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-03T21:44:28.904+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"All of those disconnections and getting stuck on authenticating sounds like there might be something blocking your network from being able to get a consistently strong connection with our servers. If flushing your DNS has been able to work in the past you made need to try giving that another go but this might also be happening if the client itself is a little damaged. Let's go ahead and run a client repair through the client options as well, and let me know how that helps.","replies":[{"poster":"LegendDragoon","date":"2017-09-05T18:21:37.762+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have run client repairs several times now.

It's a pain. I really do believe it's something with the client. I get into champ select or ban phase and it just freezes.
