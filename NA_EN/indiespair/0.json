Thats happens before, but I thought it was just a bug and I did not pay enough attention to it. I received only one chest from S with Bard and another one from a freind's S with Jhin. After that I did not get a single hextech chest for all the S, whether it be mine or my friend, while he receives all of them. And now, it happens again, and im pretty frustrating.

Once you've earned a Hextech Chest with a champion, you won't be able to earn another with that champion until the next season. \n\nYou can verify if you've already earned a Mastery chest with a certain champion by going to your Champions tab in your profile within the PVP.net Client. Once there, see if Thresh has a gold border around his portrait; if you hover over his portrait, you will see either a gold or grey chest on the bottom right corner--gold means you've already earned it.\n\nAlso, remember if someone in your premade group earns an S- or higher ranking, you earn the Hextech Chest for the champion you're playing, not the one your friend was playing; so you probably earned it for Thresh when you friend achieved an S with Jhin.\n\nIf you're having trouble locating what I've described, please hit up our Hextech Crafting Guide: \n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207884233-Hextech-Crafting-Guide\n\nScroll down to the \"Frequently Asked Questions\" section and check out \"Why am I not earning chests?\"","replies":[{"poster":"Indiespair","date":"2016-04-07T17:55:27.196+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh, really, i have earned a Thresh's chest with freind's Jhin, thank you so much for this explanation! {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"WhiskeyNine","date":"2016-04-07T16:05:08.198+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}}","replies":[{"poster":"Volcanuz","date":"2016-04-08T12:35:44.569+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Omg i love that image so much hahaha.","replies":[]}]}]}
