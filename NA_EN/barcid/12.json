And that's how it is right now: either curbstomping or painstakingly long to the point of exhausting its welcome.\r\n\r\nSo for those wondering why this can't be the case in League for the game to be healthy, the answer's actually simple:\r\n\r\nLeague's not built for it. It is actually impossible for this to be healthy.\r\n\r\nAll MOBA's following League's build tend to take the same amount of time when they're well balanced: 30-40 minutes average. So in order to achieve the shorter game times, we'll have to look at one of the very few examples in which games commonly end in half the time, and that's HotS.\r\n\r\nSo here's how HotS plays out every game:\r\n\r\nYou spawn, you wait 30 seconds to be able to head to lane while everyone prepares.\r\n\r\nIn the first actual minute, there is a teamfight.\r\n\r\nAfter this, the players spread out to soak lanes for about 3-4 minutes with 1-2 players roaming between each lane. On two-lane maps there's instead a solo and a quad lane and roaming's minimal.\r\n\r\nThis ends once the first objective point becomes activated in which case the rest of the game is basically League's endgame: teamfights on teamfights on teamfights on brief breaks to clear before teamfighting again. Then the game ends after this occurs enough times.\r\n\r\nLeague can't do this. League can't do this because you work on an item/laning system. It takes 10 minutes to get halfway to a game phase where a HotS game has already gotten to, and that's just how your game is built. Plain and simple. League is not made to be short, and when it is it's a fucking mess. Trying to make shorter times healthy for your game would just transform it into another game altogether.\r\n\r\nThat's the foundation you have set up. So please try to focus on making those 30-40 minute games as balanced and enjoyable as possible and stop fretting over length.","replies":[{"poster":"Niaphim","date":"2017-08-07T02:15:03.600+0000","up_votes":79,"down_votes":1,"body":"I have the same feeling. In an attempt to shorten games it is possible to reach such extremes that one single teamfight would decide the entire game (and we are not exactly far from that situation).\n\nI picked up League in season 3 and liked it because of how it had multiple layers and components, and  now some of them are being trivialized. One of examples is long laning phase with trading that I enjoyed so much as a support player. Currently it is transformed into a 4-5 man bot fiesta that ends shortly after 10 minute mark. Remember when we had a \"200 cs at 20 minutes\" mark to achieve? Good luck getting this score in the current meta. I get that farming for 20 minutes may sound like a chore, but in the meantime it allowed for some strategic planning for both junglers and laners.","replies":[{"poster":"Divewing","date":"2017-08-07T09:04:21.205+0000","up_votes":31,"down_votes":4,"body":"Funny thing is, we \"are\" in a tank meta.\n\n{{champion:268}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:67}} {{champion:161}} {{champion:222}} should be top tier picks.\n\nThey can't because to be top tier right now they also need to be stronger early, which completely breaks them (shit vayne deals with squishies better than tanks right now by IE-Shiv 3 shotting them off huge AD+empowered autos)","replies":[{"poster":"Arc Atlas","date":"2017-08-07T13:02:30.930+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why would Ryze be strong in a tank meta?

The ones that stem from a Warcraft mod and took at least an hour to finish one game. Those defined what a MOBA is supposed to be. Games like Age of Empires, Command & Conquer, and Starcraft are also MOBAs and they take at least an hour to complete a match because that's what makes them fun. \n\nThe ones you see that don't go past 20/30 minutes are victims of the 20-minute-MOBA craze. MOBAs that are made to finish in a small amount of time because people demand it. Some people don't like long games because it's simply not their interest, but they play it anyways because it's popular ala League of Legends and MOBAs being the next big hit right now. League games only began to become shorter when its Esports scene began to pick up, thus the game becoming more popular. People demanded the game to become more flashy and less boring, so Riot did that and created insane burst metas and awful matchmaking in Season 5 and 6 to quicken match times.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"salty testi","date":"2017-08-07T16:29:45.190+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":1,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Wildlife1","date":"2017-08-07T17:58:02.711+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Any sport gets boring when you already know the outcome before had, and the LCS is like that now.
