Even if you lose a single creep, it's still worth the trade to the advantage your jungle gains.\n\nWhy do this?\n\nSimple: To avoid the enemy jungler. Junglers who have poor early dueling can (generally) go top buff > top scuttle > farm jungle and not be behind the enemy duelist jungle, while actually not leashing them.\n\nJunglers who CAN duel early can also abuse it. Going top buff > enemy top buff > top lane / top scuttle is my favorite route on Olaf, and there's literally nothing the enemy jungler can do about it, because he beats the shit out of enemy of them in an early duel. On Rek'sai I prefer to start the enemy buff and immediately gank top lane, securing my top laner first blood kill / assist and setting them massively ahead, so that I (hopefully) tilt the enemy laner level 1 never have to go top alone.\n\nHelping your jungler leash is always worth it, they gain so much more out of it than you could ever possibly lose.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ackir","date":"2018-06-04T22:38:28.106+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Alex h8721,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=rfrroEV4,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2018-06-04T16:05:35.195+0000)\n>\n> As a top laner I always gaurd my JG&#x27;s toplane buff and ward it at 1:25.

Which would allow them to see that not a single fuck is given about the enemy team jungler (me).\n\nJust so people know, it is entirely viable for a jungler to kill Red or Blue buff at level 1, unassisted, by using smite and basic kiting techniques.

There's still more than 10 seconds to spare even. That is a fucking massive margin for error.\n\nThis is not correct though.  The margin for error in top is very small, and you make the incorrect assumption that just because someone can walk a direct line back to a wounded minion wave in that time that it makes no difference in lane pressure or CS.  Some champs and situations require you to be at the wave several seconds before the first melee minions even touch each other in order to have the best chance of a hard lane win.  And really good toplaners can and will use even the smallest difference in lane pressure to snowball (especially if you don't plan on coming back top to reciprocate the help or get tangled up elsewhere), and that includes wave health.\n\nI routinely try to hold the small bush in the topside river early as a lookout, and from there make my way up top.  I'd say I'm fine with watching your second buff until about 1:15-1:20 in publics.   But asking for my free ward is dicey, especially if you can't promise help later, and probably earlier than you think I need to be able to patrol the top area, decide if I want an early ward in the tri or river, and decide if I need subtle lane pressure/harassment if necessary - especially in publics.  \n\nIn flex or with people I know have my back I'll do much more than this, but the risk in soloQ of selfishness is way too high.

This is a &amp;quot;watch our buff&amp;quot; post.\n> \n> Simply watching your jungler&amp;#039;s buff does several things that grant you a great fucking advantage:\n> \n> 1. **You have narrowed down where the enemy jungler can possibly be.** You now know they aren&amp;#039;t taking your team&amp;#039;s camp and won&amp;#039;t be ganking you from behind. If they&amp;#039;re trying to take it (or are taking it) then you have eyes exactly on where they are and can play accordingly.\n> \n> 2. **Your jungler is kept from being put behind.** Your team can be aware if the enemy jungler is trying to steal their buff and react accordingly, meaning your jungler can go take the enemy&amp;#039;s buff in return immediately instead of having to guess where they need to be. This prevents them losing an exorbitant amount of gold and experience and so keeps them on the same level of the enemy jungler, meaning you also benefit.\n> \n> 3. **You can potentially put the enemy jungler behind.** If the enemy jungler walks up to try and take the buff and you&amp;#039;re guarding it, you can take some free hits from him. Lower health means the jungler has to play more conservatively. The enemy jungler being forced to back off from taking the buff also means they have to walk back to their own, costing them both time and pressure.\n> \n> Watching your jungler&amp;#039;s buff offers all these things at the cost of _nothing_ - it takes absolutely _nothing_ from you to do this besides at _most_ your first ward if you don&amp;#039;t want to stand watch until 1:30.\n> \n> You want to know the best part about this?\n> \n> #This does not cost you any minions or any minion waves.\n> \n> Walking to top lane from top-side buff while leaving at 1:30 (even up to 1:35) puts you back at top-lane before any minions can even be killed. There&amp;#039;s still more than 10 seconds to spare even. That is a fucking _massive_ margin for error.\n> \n> This is called **being a good teammate**. It&amp;#039;s called **playing with and for your team**. It&amp;#039;s a practice in consideration for your teammates on top of just flat out increasing your chances at winning.\n> \n> So be a good player. Watch your jungler&amp;#039;s buff.\n\n2 issues....now i cant dance in my lane for like 1:15 mins and 2.) that means im a teamplayer, which isnt what the league community is about :(\n\nbe happy i dont go {{champion:223}}  w/ {{summoner:11}}  and take yo shit!","replies":[]}]}
