For those of you who don't have any idea the asinine nature of that statement, I'll spell it out:\n\n#Toplane has _the_ largest roster in the game currently and still even finds champions from mid to migrate there as well every so often. Meaning Riven has to beat out far more champions than any other role and **_still_** has the highest playrate top.\n\nNerf this fucking cancer ridden champion already.

Either they will overextend for a creep and get chunked or killed, or be zoned out of even the exp from the wave. If you're playing up on Nasus' side of the creep wave he doesn't have many options. You can sacrifice both of your farm, but as long as only the Riven gets the exp they win. Nasus can go for an E max to try and keep some lane pressure but they'll be auto pushing and have no stacks. The Riven player can get this zone started 100% of games with hard shoving the first wave. Only way for Nasus to have a real chance is the jungler coming to break the freeze.\n\nAt 6, the Nasus for the first time has some laning pressure from his ult, but it means little into Riven early. If Riven EW buffers they can space out the wither duration with Q dashes and evade his ult. Q onto him, see if he pops it then dip until it's over. Continue to zone him until the ult's back. It's even easier with swifties.\n\nWhile IBG can be a good bandaid solution to the terrible Nasus laning, it doesn't help as much as other items. Into Riven specifically, Nasus stands the best chance rushing righteous glory and getting a randuins omen second. He has no problem killing the Riven at 2 items as long as he can stick to her for his ult duration. By then you'll most likely be in the midgame and teamfighting, but you should be beating the Riven in any 1v1 until later in the game when her full build is better than yours.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Kagetane","date":"2019-03-13T15:11:03.624+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=CaliCoastReplay,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=h4beGyFv,comment-id=00000000000000030001,timestamp=2019-03-13T00:25:55.785+0000)\n>\n> *Everyone* needs to be careful versus a good {{champion:92}}!

But after that?  As soon as I got {{item:3025}} and 100-150 stacks, she couldn't all-in anymore, and if she can't all-in she can hardly lane -  and once {{champion:75}} gets ahead, he often stays that way.

So?\n\nI bring up this point because, for the longest time, anytime someone would bring up Riven being obnoxious in the higher elos, people would throw in that she isn’t a pro pickup and only good up to Challenger. Except now, she has been getting picked up in pros, and has been doing very well, especially now that Urgot has dropped off. \n\nNow, there’s the question of why Riven is so much more obnoxious this time around. Most of us hold her extra power is due to Conqueror and Spear of Shojin, so start there. Get rid of the Awakened Dragon passive, as it’s a problem here and when it was on ER as Essence Flare. Only a few champions can take the item and use it incredibly well (Riven, Jax), while it may as well not exist for others. Other items can be this way as well (cough cough, Manamune), but this one is currently a big issue. In Rivens case, Shojin allows her to have incredibly low CDs on her dash and shield, which makes fighting her a quick loss most of the time.\n\nThen there’s Conqueror, her best rune, that she stacks incredibly quickly to unlock the true damage and the healing. This makes her strong into a good chunk of matchups, as she racks up good burst damage to deal with her opponent, and Conqueror’s heal and true damage makes her actually at least decent against tanks, if not good.\n\nThe answer may not be in Riven’s kit, but in what she builds, but the fact of the matter is that she’s sitting at a higher playrate, a pretty good winrate given her touted as “high skill” and her playrate, and now that she’s also seeing play and success in pros, *should* be signalling that something is wrong.\n\nFor the record, when a good number of other champs have been strong in both solo and pro, they get the bat. Some escape, but many have gotten the bat, including the “high skill” champs.\n\nEdit: corrected all my incorrect spellings of Conqueror","replies":[{"poster":"El Peluquero","date":"2019-03-13T15:55:12.189+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Conqueror*","replies":[{"poster":"Iota Theta","date":"2019-03-13T21:16:12.158+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Hola Soy Aguila ,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=h4beGyFv,comment-id=0012000000000000,timestamp=2019-03-13T15:55:12.189+0000)\n>\n> Conqueror*\n\nI have no idea how I messed that up so often there, or why it didn’t spell check me.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Hemulen Magi","date":"2019-03-12T05:56:42.344+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Buff top lane tanks.

However, as the tiers go up, so does her winrate. Meanwhile, her playrate is at about 15% of matches in those tiers.

And with Urgot out of pros as well, opens more room for her. It’s sad that the tankier champs aren’t holding up against her. 4/13 of her wins toplane are against tanks\n\nAs far as Aatrox, I admit, I’m glad not a complete replacement and that some teams still find use for him, albeit with a different build than he’s used in the past (seeing Youmuu’s rush less often). His ult is a big reason for that, though watching C9 Licorice use him to zone and erase an Ezreal out of a fight was satisfying, even though I believe he had to burn flash to hit his Q. \n\nThough, I know y’all think him still in pros will be problematic for buffs. Personally, think they double nerfed too much last time in hitting both sustain and the dashes.
