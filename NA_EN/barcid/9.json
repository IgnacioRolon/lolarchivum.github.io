Also I laugh every time when I recall because at the time this skin was released (season 4 I believe) Morg was a super popular support and everyone used this skin, so when they recalled and she started screaming whole Twich chat would spam \"stfu Morg\" , so remembering that always puts a smile on my face :)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"mr Boombastic787","date":"2017-06-23T15:53:12.990+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well it would be cooler if it was like a rival skin to aether wing kayle","replies":[{"poster":"reaperteaser","date":"2017-06-23T17:53:32.835+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"what about riot invoker morg?\n\nbetter yet, get a full set of riot invokers that are rivals to the riot skins","replies":[{"poster":"mr Boombastic787","date":"2017-06-23T19:48:38.370+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, but I don't think it fits Morgana's theme too well, but it is a great theme for some other champion.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"RookPusher","date":"2017-06-23T16:26:07.519+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lunar Wraith is a skin I'm mad I missed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CrazFight ","date":"2017-06-23T06:45:42.882+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sinful Is meh not really great\nBewitching splash is good in game sucks\nLunar Wraith - That one Could see that one being seen as good but I dont think its that great (OPinion i guess)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Barcid","date":"2017-06-23T05:35:15.641+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Her model's just kind of ugly in general... even the best skin on her right now only looks okay.\n\nShe could use the new model a legendary skin would bring.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"DoktorKaiser","date":"2017-06-23T21:07:52.329+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a great idea imo.

New Versus event, anyone? \n\nAlso, this Hearthstone card came to mind. I think the color palette would be perfect.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IybUbwPtzHw\n\nALSO: Weird side note. While I think Aether Wing Kayle needs a complete update, I think the death animation should be similar to how it is now. It's one of my favorite death animations/sounds. Oddly satisfying. And I think it'd be pretty neat if Morgana's death animation/sound was similar.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ithil Snek","date":"2017-06-23T16:25:15.261+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Probably after the Rework alongside with Kayle :/","replies":[]}]}
