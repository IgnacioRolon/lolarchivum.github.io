They are supposed to get behind early of course, but by hanging and continuously \"losing the minimum\" they stabilize the game to a slow bleed and then turn it around when things like a pure utility tank, pure utility support, and auto attacking ADC come online.  Think of what SKT has been so historically good at when they get behind.  They get behind by like 6 kills early, lose 2/3 outers and a drake before they even take one outer, but they stabilize it and eventually turn it around by losing the minimum and then punishing the maximum when they find an opening.\n\nBy buffing early game damage output, or nerfing early game defensive stats, you are effectively nerfing not just specific champs, but an entire style of play.  And yes, I get the casuals and LCS fans want to see fighting and kills earlier and more often because it's exciting.  But when you nerf entire classes of champs like that the pool gets limited, every game starts to feel a bit like a shit show, and every game feels like it's 80% reliant on early laning.  This is funny and interesting at first, but get's boring in it's own way very quickly.\n\nA good answer to this is buffing the ability to neutralize lanes.  Last split everyone complained about tanks.  They were overtuned to the point where they could not only act as a meat shield, but outduel other melees early on and delete squishies throughout pretty much the whole game.  So let's say we are approaching Maokai, who they nerfed his Q.  Instead of straight up nerfing it, you nerf it's damage to champs but not to minions so that way his ability to wave clear and farm safely is not hindered (or you could maybe move some damage off his q and put it on his saplings which are tough to get onto champs but easy if you want to use them on creeps).\n\nThe counter argument to this is that if you can just wave clear on him safely there are no openings for bruisers and assassins to punish early game.  This is not accurate as those classes are much more equipped to proactive early.  If Maokai can wave clear early but not damage champs, your bruisers and assassins should have priority on basically all natural objectives.  You should be taking drakes, buffs, aggressive warding, counterjungling, and setting up multi person dives every time someone overstays in lane.  Through team play and being smart.\n\nSummary:  Right now basically you just get out statted, not outplayed.  Early game dudes get one kill in each lane and take 1 tower and the game is over because they just have so much kill pressure so early.  There is so much more pressure on scaling comps to play the early game perfect, assasins and other aggressive comps should feel a similar pressure.  Both teams should feel massive mental pressure early.  Scaling team is like: oh man we got to just keep it to a slow bleed, and not get totally shat on early, scrap together every nickel I can find.  While the snowball team should be like: can't let the pressure off for a second, we on a timer, if I die by misplaying a dive I should have succeeded at with my superior kill pressure I will give them an extra 45 seconds on my 10 minute timer, etc etc.  In short, making successful, team oriented plays should be just as rewarding, and making mistakes hurts your butthole just as much regardless of scaling or burst oriented comp.\n\nI'm pointing at the removal of catchup mechanics being released at the same time they provided damage buffs to certain classes, at the same time they nerfed based defenses.  It's a huge swing in one direction, and if your answer is to go defensive stuff in secondary tree then it's almost worse because if ur a Trist going into a Lucian, he not only has more early game already, but goes gathering storm secondary tree so his window to be ahead is EVEN LONGER because while you are stalling the game out and scaling off base stats and items, he is also receiving passive bonus AD every 10  minutes.  It's a damned if you do damned if you don't situation as scaling carries, mid or bot.","replies":[{"poster":"Gives No Lux","date":"2017-12-12T00:21:13.667+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"Then don't die early.  If you're playing a comp designed to just survive the early game and you fail to do that then why should you be rewarded with the chance to turn the tide later?\n\nIf you deny snowball champs the ability to get kills then they don't snowball.  Yes, this means you trade off the ability to CS well and get any early leads but that's the point.  Working as intended.\n\nThere is a good reason that Zed is one of the highest overall performing champs but he doesn't have an amazing win rate.  You just need to adapt your style to counter snowballs.  \n\nThe two biggest reasons that I end up losing to assassins are:  One or two team members see a 4/1 Kat or Akali and just give up and start spamming /ff, OR I keep the assassin down for the early game but other lanes play risky and end up feeding them a bunch of kills anyways.\n\nI hate playing against assassins as a mage main but I'm ok with the pace of games right now, I just feel that they need to get some itemization changes to balance out the pacing of power spikes across classes.  It's o.k. that dirk gives a power boost to ad assassins on first or second buy but  the comparative codex and amp tome for mages isn't on par.\n\nI am hoping they do an itemization pass before season starts but that doesn't look like it will be the case.","replies":[{"poster":"Whisper87","date":"2017-12-12T00:32:15.528+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"That itemization pass is exactly what i'm talking about.

Lucian and corki were meta, but so were twitch and trist.  Janna and thresh both equally meta, Ryze and Fizz equally meta, Rumble and Maokai equally meta, Nunu and Elise both meta.  Because the windows for success for both styles were very similar and if you looked at teams playing lucian, thresh, fizz into teams playing orianna, janna, trist - the results were basically 50-50.

Most people always play the game like they're even or ahead all of the time.\n\nThe reason champs snowball isn't because they get an early item advantage, that only strengthens them.  They snowball so hard because they keep capitalize on the player making the same mistake over and over until they ARE out of hand.\n\nSure that isn't much fun for the team who has the guy that won't stop feeding but the alternative where defensive items are strong enough to make up for poor decisions or lack of skill.  \n\nLeague shifted to be much more casual friendly the past couple of seasons and this pre-season it's shifted to being maybe 20% more competitive than before and it's going to take some time for people to adapt.","replies":[{"poster":"Whisper87","date":"2017-12-12T04:30:12.741+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I understand how snowballing works and why it is a necessary part of the game.  And I also understand that in solo q there are always opportunities for comeback.  My question is, why did Riot deem it necessary to make the comeback more difficult.  I mean it's pretty much impossible to say they haven't considering they took away comeback XP from kill.  So in last season maybe a 1k deficit at 10 minutes shut the door like 30%, now that same deficit shuts the door like halfway.\n\nPutting so much emphasis on early game and laning hurts the health of the game.  You basically have to win 2/3 lanes now to have a chance, where as before you could say that if you were winning 1 lane you had a fighting chance.  And just think about how limiting it is to absolutely NEED to go even or better in lane.  Think about stuff like maokai and rumble where you're like, eh, I can be behind by 20-30 cs or whatever in lane, but it's ok if I lose my lane a little because my champ is PERFECT for our team fights.  If you put more emphasis on the first 10 minutes, you effectively shut out the option of choosing a synergistic team comp over strong lanes. \n\nAgain, this limits your options, which means game is less dynamic and fun.  I'll always to back to the season where Samsung White won worlds as the ideal balance.  Pick comps were viable, poke comps were viable, engage wombo was viable, disengage shielding team fights were viable, early game and late game champs were viable in literally every role, assassins and control mages alike were played mid, engage and ranged supports both saw play.\n\nAnd I would argue that making the game naturally shorter actually caters to casuals more as most of them have the win or lose in 20 mins mentality (which is actually more like win or lose in 15 now with the new surrender system).  My point is there has to be a limit, Riot cannot keep shortening the average game length.  Think of watching a good best of 5 series, part of the fun is in the back and forth.  If your individual matches have a little rubberband back and forth, you can capture a bit of that excitement in solo q.  No one likes a game where you just turn off your brain and are just like \"i wish they would just surrender already\" then you have to play it out for several  more minutes. BUT, if you know that even with your 5k lead you have to be very very on your toes, that match becomes much more engaging and more fun.  I always tell my teamates that there is no such thing as a lead so big you can just screw around, and I believe Riot should embrace that idea, rather than make the point where people are so far ahead they can go YOLO mode even earlier.  I'd also say that shorter games means the game is LESS competitive.  Because while the skill gap may have become much more apparent in how the early to mid game plays out, players can just focus a ton on laning and climb really high.  I say as a community we should be thinking about having even new or bronze players learn from the the ground up that your laning, macro, team fighting, vision control, and the like are all equally important.\n\nIf a team if 4/10 at laning but 6/10 at team fighitng and objective control, they should stand a perfectly fine chance against a team that is 6/10 at laning but 4/10 at the other stuff.  Right now that is not the case at all.  Don't  let \"win lane win game\" and one tricks stop people from playing League of Legends instead of YOLO Q.","replies":[{"poster":"Gives No Lux","date":"2017-12-12T05:51:26.014+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I don't feel this to be the case and I don't feel that the data represents this as well.  I win often enough with one or two lanes behind to believe that it's quite possible.  That doesn't mean that it's easy and just as often we lose but I rarely feel that I have no chance of winning except for a couple of champs like Master Yi.\n\nI do quite often feel that teammates just give up and that hurts our chances much more than anything the opponents are doing.","replies":[{"poster":"Whisper87","date":"2017-12-12T14:31:19.407+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I definitely don't feel like it's impossible to make a comeback, but I think it's just harder now.  There are fewer windows and those windows are smaller.  \n\nCatchup Xp used to make it so that if you were behind by several kills and a tower or two, you were effectively back in the game if you got a kill on a high priority target.  You bought yourself a lot of time because of that xp surge.  If there is no xp surge then that window for a comeback you had is smaller, the impact of a \"comeback kill\" is smaller.\n\nNow also combine this with the fact that assassins are working with electrocute which may not be as good for trading as thunderlords was, but is actually better in all ins.  Then take in to account that early game defensive stats have been nerfed, then take into account that if you choose to go defense in your secondary tree you are contributing to the power gap in a meaningful way because you can't take things like gathering storm on an adc in your secondary tree (so it takes even longer to catch up in terms of damage cuz you're not just trying to catch up in items and xp, but now a passive stat gain too).\n\nI mean when you look at it like this I don't know how you can say Riot hasn't made snowballing through the early-mid game more impactful.  They've made it easier to slam the door shut when you get ahead.  I play in the mid platinum tier which I know is not very high but people at least have a rudimentary concept of the game, and still I'd say at least 4/5 games I play are fully one sided stomps win or lose.  They should not just keep lowering the average game time.  This is I believe the 3rd time in the past 5 seasons where fairly major changes have come down that result in a lower average game time.  Do we just have to sit back and accept that in a couple years the average game time is gonna be like 24 minutes in solo q and just hand the game over to the aggro monkeys?","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Barcid","date":"2017-12-12T03:26:18.482+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The issue isn't even just that an enemy can snowball the game out of control.\n\nMe snowballing the game out of control through virtually no real effort in a matter of a couple minutes out of a potential 20 is not challenging at all, and after the first couple times of doing it the relative lack of effort required to get a team rolling is so token it's not even rewarding. Being able to tell how a game will go after the first few minutes kind of ruins the competitive aspect when you have essentially dwarfed the competition.

It is up to the enemy team to first make a mistake in order for you to capitalize on it.  The thing about this season is that \"mistakes\" are harder and harder to effectively punish since the gap in power widens very, very quickly - hence the issue with snowballing.  And when you have a very wide power gap, it thus takes bigger and bigger mistakes to close it - to the point that there are very much instances where these mistakes simply don't matter.\n\nAgain. You simply don't understand the game right now.

The fact that champions like that are being played more often and seeing high win rates means people are prioritizing them because they are seeing success with them.  \n\nThere is a reason why all the streamers are playing lethality poke varus instead the auto attack version now days - they all agree it's more reliable in terms of seeing impact/success.  If the game were balanced properly, you should be able to look at the top 5 most winning champs in any role (given they have a reasonable sample size of being played regularly) and see a good mix of early-mid game snowballers, lane bullies, scaling team fighters, and more team-oriented utility picks.\n\nIm an ADC main so from my point of view that means I'd like to took at the most winning champs and see a mix of things like mid game focused ezreal and MF, then some utility focused ashe or kalista, then some scalers like trist and kog.  The only scaling adc's seeing strong success right now are things like Twitch and Vayne who (surprise surprise) have some windows in the mid game that the other scaling adcs like trist and kog don't have.  And the \"utility\" adc's being prioritized right now are jhin and varus who are both able to transition in the high poke/burst lethality builds (again focused on mid game).\n\nNow you could say this is just because people are just choosing to play more lane bullies and mid game spikers and that is why the games feel so snowball.  THAT IS EXACTLY THE POINT.  People are picking champs like this because they feel like they have the most reliable results, their experience is telling them that if they choose lane bullies or those who hit big early/mid game power spikes, their chance of winning is higher than if they chose to go utility and assist the team or go scaling and farm for team fights.  When you see the vast majority of a community trending in one direction, it is a BIG sign that things are significantly wrong.  \n\nRiot recognized this with the ardent sensor mess last season and fixed it in a reasonable, controlled manner.  I'm looking for them to do something similar maybe with lethality, buffs to base defensive stats, or tweaks to the sorcery/domination trees.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
