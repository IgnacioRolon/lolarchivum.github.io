{"poster":"Barcid","date":"2017-12-11T10:04:28.354+0000","title":"Zoe","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Not here to say she&#039;s OP. Here to cover a few things about her.\n\nOne: she&#039;s Nidalee with no escape. Her only &quot;escape&quot; is a temporary 1 second (unless she has flash which what-the-hell-ever, everybody and their mother has it) teleport - not even a blink.  It will return her to her original position every time. Ergo, the way you demolish the giggling little shit is to dive her. Hard. When you see a Zoe, taking a tank like Sejuani or Nautilus or a bruiser like Vi or Warwick can force her to have to be insanely safe or die - and if she ever misses that bubble, the vast majority of her real damage is now gone. It&#039;s your time to engage on her.  Remember: she&#039;s Nidalee. Meaning the further away she is the more damage she will do.  Get close.\n\nTwo: if your teammate gets nailed by a sleep bubble - unless it&#039;s a tank - stand in front of them and take the shot.  Zoe hitting someone who&#039;s sleeping causes them to take bonus **_true damage_**, which is the reason you still blow the fuck up while building a power/defense item versus a straight defensive item with health.  Before people start saying that&#039;s absurd and OP, keep in mind this is to keep Zoe relevant against things that aren&#039;t just full squishies - if she only had these two abilities to rely on for damage against someone building resistances, she&#039;d get basically nothing done.  And her combo isn&#039;t quite so spammable as Nidalee&#039;s goddamn spears used to be.\n\nThree: this is more a comment on her balance - the only thing that makes literally no fucking sense is the last part of her E: that **_she gets cooldown reduction on her E for hitting somebody with sleep_**.  This means that if you end up accidentally stepping on a bubble you didn&#039;t see or if she builds enough base cooldown with her bubble traveling far enough, she can actually chain this stupid ass ability on you before you can actually respond - for a grand total of 4 seconds of not fucking moving and waiting to be blown up.  And you thought Morgana was obnoxious.  **I can not for the life of me understand why the ever-loving fuck Zoe needs an additional reward for hitting her CC**.  **_Literally - and I do mean literally - no other champion in the game gets bonus cooldown reduction on a hard crowd control ability for hitting an enemy with it._**\n\nFour: Another obnoxious thing: cleansing the &quot;drowsy&quot; effect will still cause your champion to fall asleep anyway.  This is just fucking stupid period.  If I&#039;m no longer drowsy, why the hell would I just suddenly go into a goddamn coma?\n\nSo that&#039;s it.  To sum up:\n\n**To play against Zoe: charge her and protect your sleeping teammates.**\n\n**Stupid shit in Zoe&#039;s kit: Cooldown reduction on her E for _HITTING A FUCKING CHAMPION WITH IT_, cleansing the Drowsy effect doesn&#039;t prevent Sleep.**","replies":[{"poster":"skoulker","date":"2017-12-11T16:41:54.978+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Literally - and I do mean literally - no other champion in the game gets bonus cooldown reduction on a hard crowd control ability for hitting an enemy with it.\"\nThresh?","replies":[{"poster":"Barcid","date":"2017-12-12T03:31:17.484+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well I'll be damned.

I do disagree with your analysis on the reduced cooldown when hitting a champion with E though.  It's just as much a reward for landing it as a punishment for missing it.  If she misses with it, she's extremely vulnerable until it's back up.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TengenToppaGnar","date":"2017-12-11T12:44:24.467+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She is Obnoxious, and people who don't know how to play against her make her Overbearing.","replies":[]}]}
