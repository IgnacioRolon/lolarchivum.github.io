Whenever you run the Hextech Repair Tool for a reinstall, it will uninstall everything that is in League's default install directory. When you ran the tool to reinstall League, since Steam was in the same location it was uninstalled as well.\n\nWe can still get to the bottom of the weird black boxes around spell effects.

Your best bet is to try and run the [**Hextech Repair Tool**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367-Automated-Troubleshooting-Hextech-Repair-Tool) again with the force repatch option selected. This way you won't be uninstalling anything, but the toll will still be able to go through and repair any damaged files.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mister Domino","date":"2017-03-31T04:16:45.047+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bump again since they pick and chose what they respond to.
