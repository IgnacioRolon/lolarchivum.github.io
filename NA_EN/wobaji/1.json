Dead Man's Plate becomes gold efficient at 79 29% gold efficiency at maximum Momentum (+47.4 movement speed) and reaches Momentum.","url":"http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Dead_Man%27s_Plate","image":"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/4/41/Dead_Man%27s_Plate_screenshot.png/revision/latest?cb=20150807154308"},"up_votes":39,"down_votes":2,"body":"80% gold efficiency with a mostly utility passive doesn&#039;t seem that appealing. It&#039;s true that at 79 stacks it&#039;s gold-efficient but that disappears the second you use it and even at max stacks it&#039;s just 105% gold efficient. Deadman&#039;s fully stacked only does 100 single target magic damage once and it&#039;s used up even if you attack a monster or minion. I don&#039;t mind this at all because it can make clearing more efficient while also providing situational windows of power but the point is that it&#039;s not 100% uptime like for the passives on Thornmail, Sunfire, Randuin&#039;s etc.\n\nRanduin&#039;s has an AoE slow and the 20% crit. reduction is always useful as long as they have a champion buying crit. such as Yasuo, Cait etc. It also reduces AS by 15% which can be very helpful for your team. Sunfire&#039;s not really in the same class but 43 magic damage per second is nothing to sneeze at and can apply in AoE (helps pushing too). Thornmail has grievous wounds, does 35+ return damage to any attacker, cripples their AS and provides 40 more armor at the expense of 150 HP. All of these items seem a lot better either for your team as a whole or your own power.\n\nDeadman&#039;s offers more subtle power in terms of play-making and utility but it&#039;s just not on par. When I think of utility, IBG comes to mind. It offers a large slow zone, Sheen damage for a fast power spike and a massive 20% CDR. The mana on IBG is excessive and I&#039;d gladly trade it for some HP but it still fits utility builds better. If Deadman&#039;s is to compete with this while being 200g more expensive, it should offer some CDR too. 10% CDR is worth 266g and that&#039;s a reasonable spot for it. \n\nIBG would still be the utility Sheen item with the most CDR on an armor item but Deadman&#039;s would be better cemented in its category as the play-making utility option and it would start to appeal to more junglers too. **It would fulfill a very important niche as a CDR + HP & Armor item.  Abyssal has CDR, Spirit Visage has CDR, Adaptive Helm has CDR. There's a gap in itemization. Currently, IBG is the only aggressive armor item to offer this combination and it&#039;s not good on manaless users or if you want some protection vs magic damage too.** Plus, IBG is about being sticky once you reach a target while Deadman&#039;s is more about getting to that target in the first place.\n\n**EDIT: If 10% CDR sounds like too much of a buff, perhaps the slow can be increased by .5 seconds. This is a decent place to start because it focuses on its play-making aspect - solidifying its identity. Just test various options but don't weaken its identity. Although, I'd rather have 10% CDR and fewer defensive stats because I don't buy Deadman's for the greatest ban/buck defensive slot item. That usually ends up being Randuin's.**","replies":[{"poster":"MadViking","date":"2018-05-08T17:10:10.463+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"If plate offered cdr it would be my first armor item on a fighter  that's for sure.\n\nYou make good points.

We don't want that either. If that's the case, maybe it's better just to give it a very tiny buff like another 25 HP or 6 more MS. **Thinking about it more, maybe the 50% slow for melees can be made to be 2 seconds like IBG or at least 1.5 seconds. This would be a small buff without having to change any stats and I think .5 seconds more of slowing is a very safe buff. **_Perhaps I am wrong and it's not weaker. I definitely like its passives for champions that want mobility + a bit of stickiness and damage.\n\nAlthough, I suppose it's natural that some items will just almost always be preferred by certain types of champs and that doesn't necessarily mean they're OP. I'm going to want SV as my MR item on any champion with healing such as Mundo, WW, Aatrox, Nasus, Singed, champs buying lifesteal items or gunblade etc. That's just working as intended though. If I were buying SV as a core item on Nautilus or Skarner, maybe it's an issue.","replies":[{"poster":"Z3Sleeper","date":"2018-05-10T08:25:47.079+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Buffing the slow makes it better for everyone, meaning better for tanks more than anyone.

Basically anything a Fighter would want more than a Tank.\n\ntanks love tenacity and slow resistance too and some tanks such as Skarner have huge base ADs\n\nplus, why make it randomly better on some champs. just because they RNGd better AD? what's wrong with it being a good option for tanks who desire those things? unless it's broken or not suitable for any other kinds of champs, I don't see the problem.\n\nthe way I see it, the richer the itemization and the more you use it based on your preferences and style rather than your defined champ/class, the better. I don't even want a \"you're X champ, so you must build this and if you're a random Evelynn wanting this item, it'll be shit\" type of binary itemization. there are already enough reasons why I wouldn't go this on champs like Eve just because I want AP, want good actives like Zhonya's, want better slot efficiency and so on \n\nif you want to go that route to incentivize other types of champs more, maybe make it scale with 10% bonus AP and AD for its damage. I'm a bit scared of a GB Akali or LB roaming with it though. :D \n\nI think buffing the slow by half a second is actually better than this because it appeals to everyone but matters more for squishy champions because they naturally tend to have less CC in their kits and depend more on finding the right openings than a tank. It's less punishing for a tank to fail an engage compared to let's say a Diana who can just barely fail a kill and then dies for nothing. Fighters like Darius, Fiora, Jax and others all have far less CC than tanks. Nautilus, Maokai and others like them have so much CC already that they don't really care about another 0.5 seconds added to the slow. They also can't utilize that time particularly well. A fed Fiora or Camille maybe can take 10% of your HP in 0.5 seconds but a Maokai just whittles you down. In other words, 0.5 sec more of a slow appeals much more to damage champions and especially those who need to stick to a target and aren't just going to sit in the middle of the entire teamfight like an Amumu.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"PrometheS","date":"2018-05-08T17:13:08.026+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MadViking,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=0x5h63dx,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-05-08T17:10:10.463+0000)\n>\n> If plate offered cdr it would be my first armor item on a fighter  that&#x27;s for sure.\n> \n> You make good points.

CDR is definitely missing on armor items compared to magic resistance items. I'm not sure why. Maybe it's because armor items already have so many passives. Maybe they didn't want you to overcap CDR by accident? Now that we have Transcendence, that's not even much of an issue.

You are pretty much never capping CDR or coming close unless you buy FH or IBG which are both incredibly niche items since they give ZERO health and thus causes you to get shredded by the enemy mage midgame since you dumped ~3000g into straight armor. You will end up getting like 10% from an MR item, 10% from a righteous glory or something, and maybe 10% from warmogs if the game goes long enough and you are constantly seiging. The only CDR that a tank is currently &quot;guarenteed&quot; to pick up is off an MR item.

It would be amazing to make it synergize with death somehow, maybe deal magic damage to the one that kills you or grant them less gold, Singed would love it :D. I know it would only be a minor buff but we need some crazy items, everything is just too boxed at the moment. All the fun items like Atmas or Sword of the Occult are long gone. We need something trollish. Or maybe make it grant resistances to your team if you die near them.

Such restraints would make it clunky for me. There are already items like Righteous Glory that focus more on very conditional MS for engaging. DMP can even help someone escape when collapsed on or allow sneaky plays.","replies":[]},{"poster":"wobaji","date":"2018-05-09T15:36:33.789+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=CoffeeMug,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=0x5h63dx,comment-id=000a,timestamp=2018-05-09T06:47:58.250+0000)\n>\n> How about it gave only MS towards the target that&#x27;s dealing damage to you?
