So why not 3100g because that&#039;s how much a Ruby Crystal would make it worth? Simple, the time to farm it up is itself a deterrent and a cost. 3k gold is not cheap so delaying the spike by another 300g is already enough to make up for the 100g improved gold efficiency. This change would make it more attractive as a counter item without feeling totally useless vs other kinds of damage and with the buff to Cut Down as well as the proposed buffs to ADCs vs tanks, I think that&#039;s plenty enough to compensate.","replies":[{"poster":"LEAFERA","date":"2018-04-28T22:22:00.321+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Honestly, this will help FH to be viable In any situation\nbut, do you really want that?\n{{sticker:sg-ahri-1}}","replies":[{"poster":"wobaji","date":"2018-04-28T22:26:29.789+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=LEAFERA,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=BYhgozoo,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-04-28T22:22:00.321+0000)\n>\n> Honestly, this will help FH to be viable In any situation\n> but, do you really want that?\n> {{sticker:sg-ahri-1}}\n\nWhy wouldn't it be good for it to be viable?

ADC.\n\nNot to mention that it's still far more vulnerable to magic damage than Randuin's and has less synergy with % HP like the Cinderhulk passive or Titanic. FH fits best as a 2nd item because the CDR and mana are stats you want early but going it first is too awful for laning and won't help with waveclear or dueling (compared to Bami's, Ninja, Sunfire, etc.). However, as it is now, it's not even an attractive 2nd item and I think part of it is just the slot inefficiency, and hyper focus on pure armor (no crit. reduction, no HP, no MS etc.). The other armor items provide more mixed protection and the components are better for laning too. You certainly don't want to be buying mana crystals while laning but a ruby crystal is acceptable.","replies":[{"poster":"Azadethe","date":"2018-04-29T02:57:59.421+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You don't buy mana crystals. you buy {{item:3024}} .
