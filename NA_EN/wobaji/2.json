The most I'd do in a game is suggest different build paths or what not to do with our comp. I don't do it in a way that personally attacks though. It's always about the gameplay itself, not the player. For example, I might say \"Blowing Ori ult. 5v5 to try to turret dive a Nautilus under turret is a bad idea. We need to just whittle them down.\" I won't say \"wow, you're bad as hell! wtf were you thinking? go back to Bronze noobs\" If you are not even allowed to communicate gameplay related ideas (not ad hominems!), I don't see the purpose of a functional chat. \n\nThe pattern I notice is that when I am heavily harassed and do not take responsibility for the BS they accuse me of, I get reported even more (by the actually toxic players - to which I often said nothing for the entire game till they berate me). The Taric and Sivir in this game specifically said they'd try to get me banned and were whining ever since lobby (because I like playing AP Kog). I was constantly accused of trolling just due to a non-meta pick which I've mained past seasons. After the game, I got an instant chat restriction for the first time. This however, isn't the first time ragers said they'd try to get me banned through unjustified report. I've seen some similar cases too searching the forums.\n\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/VzLZtMLe-toxic-players-ganged-up-on-me-got-me-a-2-week-ban-read-if-you-dont-believe-it\n\nIn the game, I got camped by Hecarim and Katarina got a lead off it. As an immobile mage, there wasn't much I could do. Quite a few of the times I died, I was nearly at my turret and Hecarim just ganked over the wall from our jungle. I absorbed 3 ganks before 7 minutes until finally dying. Hecarim E into Kat's mobility allows easy dives and I felt helpless against it. I was accused of trolling and inting (even after just 1 death). I didn't even die to Katarina solo during lane phase and had a CS + HP lead until the camp paid off.  Every time I lost some pressure mid or died, my respawn timer was pinged by Sivir and Taric (who were also losing lane just straight 2v2) + some comment about how bad I am and what a troll I've been, how everyone should report me etc. \n\nIt's hard to understand chat in a vacuum and it's really disappointing that Riot doesn't provide at least anonymous context. I'm obviously not talking to a wall in the game. I feel like this is a huge disservice to honest evaluation since language is context dependent and you can't have a solo conversation without looking insane. It's basically rigged against you. You could be winning in the game by a large margin and when a fed carry dies for the first time, you type \"feeder\" as a joke. Later, however, the game is thrown and perhaps you're blamed for it. The false reports create an investigation and the chat analyzer decides you were toxic because you called someone a feeder even though any human in that game realizes it was a joke. They need to abandon this BS and bring back a system where you're judged by a community of your peers. Even one innocent player punished unfairly is worse than a dozen toxic players being correctly punished. They should at the very least have an appeal process which is actually valid (support just gives some generic copy pasted response and virtually never reverses a punishment or admits wrongdoing). It's fine to have an automated system for this stuff, but not by itself.\n\nBTW: The comment saying \"your build is very bad\" was a reference to the hypothetical build he was demanding I go. I also don't think that's at all toxic because it's just my opinion that Morello and Rylai's are no longer good on AP Kog relative to the alternatives. He's not really a poke champion now. He's a burst + execute champion. The build I was doing is definitely much better and the top AP Kog in the world (he's D1 EUW &amp; EUNE) explains why in his guide.\n\n\nHere's the only chat log given: \n\nGame 1\nwobaji: hec burnted through all my pots sigh\nwobaji: no she didn't\nwobaji: she was losing\nwobaji: hec wone lane for her\nwobaji: can't doa nyhting 1v2\nwobaji: wasn't even far\nwobaji: 3rd gnak\nwobaji: it wouldn't matter what i was\nwobaji: if i don't have an escape\nwobaji: if i were xerath\nwobaji: same thing\nwobaji: just jg autowinning a lane\nwobaji: zero counterplay to it\nwobaji: ifn immobile\nwobaji: mid's done off htat\nwobaji: but all our other alnes should be winning sicne hec ganked 3x mid before 7 min\nwobaji: that was in no way my fault\nwobaji: idk why you keep pinigng lmao\nwobaji: you're note ven winning bot solo\nwobaji: hec counterganks adn so he wins\nwobaji: because he already got fed earlier from camping\nwobaji: muting all\nwobaji: if you didn't want to play witha kog mid\nwobaji: you were free to judge\nwobaji: in champ select and dodge\nwobaji: if not, zero right to compalin\nwobaji: neither is sivir\nwobaji: i have issues because i don't like getting spam pinged my timer whenever i die>?\nwobaji: dude help push\nwobaji: hec wil kill m\nwobaji: it's fien\nwobaji: he left\nwobaji: btw, i realize ap kog's not the best but I enjoy playing him\nwobaji: before the reworks, he was 100% viable in any elo bust challenger\nwobaji: this was true\nwobaji: for 3 seasons\nwobaji: maybe more\nwobaji: lol\nwobaji: morello\nwobaji: your build is very bad\nwobaji: with mroello\nwobaji: or rylais\nwobaji: rylais used to be good before rework\nwobaji: mever doed sp;p\nwobaji: never died solo\nwobaji: so you tell me\nwobaji: 2 mid\nwobaji: 3\nwobaji: shvoe bot\nwobaji: ?\nwobaji: that's the least of the issues\nwobaji: look at yourself\nwobaji: why don't you win lane when their jungler spends 10 minutes mid?\nwobaji: you even counter them\nwobaji: E any hook\nwobaji: if taric gets grabbed, it's a free win\nwobaji: etc.\nwobaji: rammus, where's your stattik shiv? you need to carry this\nwobaji: at least i got 11 now\nwobaji: nope\nwobaji: i didn't even play badly tbh\nwobaji: not much i can do\nwobaji: no, just reality\nwobaji: what do you want me to do vs hec diving + kat ult\nwobaji: ?\nwobaji: hec still focusses me\nwobaji: event hoguh i'm weak\nwobaji: not really\nwobaji: took him 10 sec\nwobaji: i have hp\nwobaji: sivir si easier\nwobaji: sivir is squisheir\nwobaji: if he were divign her\nwobaji: how is that my fault in any way whatsoever?\nwobaji: i die warding near my base and so sivir harasses me\nwobaji: as if that's somehow inting or in any way my fautl\nwobaji: i get turret dived, more harassment\nwobaji: and?\nwobaji: if i were xerath, do you think kat wouldn't kill me there or hec dives woudlnt' wrok?\nwobaji: if it's trolling, it's RIot's fault\nwobaji: he was viable AP since release till rework\nwobaji: pretty sure i even outdamaged this raging sivir\nwobaji: i never inted even once, they're just lyign\n\nEDIT: For clarification, the comment about outdamaging Sivir was a response to being told that I was useless and did no damage. I ended up doing the most damage on our team but we were nearly 20k behind at the time of the comment. I was no serious threat to them. \n\nI find it both hilarious and sad that I got punished here. I wasn't even retaliating. I was simply explaining the situation while waiting to respawn/walking to mid and being unfairly characterized as an inter/troll etc. (it was a blowout game all over the map). I'm sure that's not against any rule. When I responded less, those two resorted to all chat harassment and calls for reports on me. It feels like yet another case where the victim is the one blamed and punished. If someone doesn't like you in this game, it doesn't seem to matter whether they make unethical reports or not because there's no Tribunal anymore. There's no oversight, just some automated nonsense where the salty people reporting are judge, jury and executioner and your defense is nowhere to be found. There is no impartial jury giving you a fair trial.\n\nIf enough people get annoyed by you over time, all the BS reports actually lead to a punishment. There are plenty of games where I say \"my bad\"  and take responsibility for mistakes. That's not required but I have no problem with that. However, I won't take responsibility for what I don't think is in my control. These toxic players are furious when you refuse to be their scapegoat so they report you. It's also quite funny that I had this Sivir next game as a Thresh and carried that game with AP Kog. This time he harassed his ADC more but also berated me in lobby and near the start of the game. He only raged less when it was clear we'd win but even in that game, after he fails a play mid (with me under turret with a wave), he starts raging at me. and calls for reports are issued.","replies":[{"poster":"StarGuardianWeeb","date":"2017-10-12T23:27:01.799+0000","up_votes":38,"down_votes":1,"body":"I want to chime in here and say that my friend yesterday just had to get a hold of Riot support because a false report got him a 14-day ban. The jungler told them to literally KYS and the system automatically banned him because he said back \"wow really? You tell your team to kys? Over a game? Okay kid muted.\" And the jg reported him falsely.\n\nAnd the support person on the other line said that apparently you are not allowed to say it back to them, you are supposed to immediately mute them and not respond or else you face a penalty too. All he could do was change his ban to a 25 game chat restrict which it's better but still makes him obviously upset because he did do the right thing and mute them after that. (Side note that jungler also got banned after all this,  and his was apparently permanent.)\n\nI hope that next year that's what riot dedicates all their time to, getting a better system that can track the validity of certain reports as well as getting people that actually deserve to be banned punished sooner so they can ruin less games. This automatic system is doing okay bit it needs a serious improvement and some dedicated team members.","replies":[{"poster":"MonkeyMadness","date":"2017-10-13T02:51:33.855+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":3,"body":"Ya, see this is the problem with Riot. They actually firmly believe at an institutional level that context does not matter, despite the fact that entire legal systems are designed to the contrary. What your friend did is technically \"bannable\" because Riot has arbitrary rules regarding \"the use of the mute function as a weapon\" and a 100% lack of context in the report function. So basically, the ban bot saw that your friend threatened with a mute and also used the phrase \"kys\" while calling out another player. So even though he/she did absolutely nothing wrong, the ban bot simply checks off the criteria required for a punishment and then issues it automatically (note, I can say for a fact that Riot Games reviews precisely none of the bans issued by the ban bot, except MAYBE for permabans, but I can't be certain there as I've never been permabanned).\n\nWe need a massive reform of this system, but we've needed it for years and Riot has done nothing. The Tribunal and its ability to see the context of each player's actions is the only feasible way around this, but that would require Riot to admit that they fucked up by removing it, which they will never do.","replies":[{"poster":"Kloqdq","date":"2017-10-13T14:33:29.104+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":4,"body":"Technically speaking, Riot holds the right to do this as it is apart of their terms of service.\n\nWhen X player tells Y player to \"kys\" and Y player responds with \"Kys\", they have both failed to meet the terms of service. This is regardless if Y player is doing it as a response or \"defense\". Even then it's a really grey area as to it being defense.\n\nThe tribunal as a system is a flawed one since it takes a lot of man power and upkeep to make functional and over time it became nearly impossible to truly touch on every single report that came in simply due to the ever growing nature of the game. It's why they have the current automatic bot in place. It is a system that can instantly react to the reports that come in rather than a report lingering and almost never being hit. \n\nI don't believe there needs to be a massive reform of the system but it does need some fine tuning. It's not perfect, and never will be. But for the massive task this is, it needs to exist. Does it need to be the only existing system in place though? Probably not.","replies":[{"poster":"MonkeyMadness","date":"2017-10-13T14:54:55.578+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"Read the fucking chat logs dude.

People seem to think that tons of players are being falsely accused of shit on a daily basis when it rarely happens. In the like 3 months I've been actively look at the boards there has had to be at least 10 players out of hundreds that have actually been falsely punished. This guy, maybe didn't deserve it. He is slightly negative. Does that mean he should have been hard punished? Based on this info, no. Though I don't have all the info needed. Maybe he is worse, maybe not. No idea. If it's false, it will get sorted out. Like it always does. \n\nThe system has issues but the Tribunal was not perfect either.

This only applies to people who are permanently banned. It takes Riot so long to respond to false bans that anything other than a permaban will have expired long before they get involved. Also, in my extensive personal experience with this automated system, I can't even get a Rioter to talk to me about my punishments. I have literally only ever got automated or severely canned responses that simply included links to the Player Behavior page on the website without addressing a single one of my concerns (ie false reports, massively exaggerated punishments, such as my 14 day time ban, 30 game chat restriction, and 15 game ranked ban ALL FOR A SINGLE INSTANCE OF SAYING \"gg afk\" without actually going afk).\n\nThe only issue with the Tribunal was temporality.

Especially if you play off meta and thus get falsely reported more than others. It definitely starts counting against you. I'm pretty sure they just look at the report frequency along with some keywords. If you get reported significantly more than the normal population, even if the reports are BS, you will get punished. The reason they say false reports won't count against you is that in most cases, if those people reporting are isolated cases, it won't move you to the threshold of a punishment. \n\nHowever if people routinely don't like you and want to use you as a scapegoat due to an off meta pick or because you refuse to take all blame etc. you'll be reported more than average so the system will think you are at fault automatically.

If you type during re spawning or walking, I see no problem with it. It's only retaliation that I'd take issue with. For example, if someone calls you garbage and you say \"you're an autistic retard\", that's clear retaliation. If we were judging chat purely by what's most useful to say, there would be almost nothing said ever that pings can't just as equally represent.  Stuff like \"gj\" or \"wp\" is equally useless and doesn't provide any truly valuable information. Are we judging that too? You're allowed to defend yourself and explain the situation.  You shouldn't have to just decide to take all the blame for whatever people feel like. Does that mean the explanations matter? Maybe they only matter to the player feeling unfairly accused but to take even that away gives way too much power to toxic players.

He was responding to the armchair players telling him what to build instead. Also, last time I checked, you're allowed to have opinions on builds. Even if it was a real build, people are allowed to think what they want about certain strategies and builds. Some things are just true even if not positive.  We can't silence all comments that aren't positive just because someone can get offended (which is true no matter what). Some stuff is actually very justified. This isn't the thought police.

I told him that it's just objectively awful because he needs CDR more than AP and doesn't have the gold income for a fast RoA anyway. He says he always does it and that's pretty much that.
