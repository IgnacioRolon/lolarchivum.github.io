I think CLG can take a game off them, but TSM just goes full beast mode in best of 3s and best of 5s.

They are a slow paced team and that is why they may take a little longer to close but at the same time take note that their slower pace make it so they are almost never \"come-backed\" on but at the same time they are a team that often makes come-backs themselves because those other teams are so eager and slip up.\n\n2nd: TIP Their potential is just plain scary, with C9 looking out of form recently I have to give this spot to TIP, their players are consistent and very very good. They have top 3 NA top laner, top 3 jungler, top 3 mid laner, and even their bot lane is improving. They have no weakness besides their slip ups when ahead which all NA teams have except for TSM and the old C9.\n\n3rd: C9, I think they will start to get back to their old form just in time to take 3rd in the play-offs. If C9 returns to their old form their is no explanation needed as to why they would finish top 3.\n\n4th: CLG I can't imagine them being anything less than the typical let down. They are a strong team for sure, you could say their line up on paper is maybe better than TSM but the stats always show that CLG drops the ball.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Smart Kitty","date":"2015-03-19T01:16:17.530+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a CLG fan, this is the most hope I've ever had for the team. They're the only top tier team who hasn't lost a notably weaker team. I also think they have and TSM have the highest skillcaps. TSM is looking really good this season though (which sorta hurts to say being a diehard CLG fan) and I actually wouldn't mind if they won since they actually look really good right now. I don't really think C9 is gonna do well in the playoffs. Right now TiP looks like a stronger candidate, but I won't be convinced they're a possible 1st place team unless they beat CLG. If Team Liquid ever get the same synergy with Piglet or find another play style most of the team can benefit from, they could also take first. They've beaten both TSM and CLG (though not with ease) when they played with Keith, but they've still had their hiccups like losing to WFX (even with keith) and losing to most other teams with Piglet. So I'm gonna believe in CLG. If not them, then TSM.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jbob2015","date":"2015-03-18T18:11:53.325+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like how everyone forgets that team impulse has stomped the top teams, and easily beat tsm right before iem.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PoisonedTea","date":"2015-03-17T08:36:20.352+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think anyone can stop TSM right now.\n\nCLG is playing well but when it comes to a best of 3 or 5 I can't see TSM losing.
