It forces me to reset my computer. When I get back into the game after this, it's back to the normal 180 FPS. Anyone else have a similar issue or know how I can fix it?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-20T22:47:16.656+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wonder if you're seeing this FPS drop due to a missing graphics driver update.
