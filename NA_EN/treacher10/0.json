Also, this isn't about other players, this is about you and you alone. Not only that but I've seen multiple cases here where the use of racial slurs caused the escalation of an account to 2-week ban status, so unless you can provide actual concrete proof of cases where people who have said the exact same thing you did only got chat restrictions I'm afraid that what you say is just simply not true.

These are cumulative. You don't get free passes for being nice for a while. You will continue to get punished. There's a concept called recidivism in the punishment structure. If you are a recidivist, you repeat your offenses. Recidivists get harsher and harsher punishments each time because they don't learn their lesson from slaps on the wrist.\n","replies":[{"poster":"treacher10","date":"2017-05-26T04:38:01.104+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"HA with that logic then I should be on my second offense which is a 25 game chat ban.

Nice comment though, smart one :)\n\nWhen I said punishments are based on frequency and severity, not just one or the other.\n\nYour logic appears to be \"1st offense is 1st level of punishment, 2nd offense 2nd level of punishment\"\n\nThe actual scale is \"worse of the two\" kind of thing.\n\nSo offense LEVEL is taken into account in addition to how frequently you offend.\n\nFor argument sake, take this example:\n\nOffense level 1 with Frequency level 1 = Punishment level 1\n\nOffense level 1 with Frequency level 2 = Punishment level 2\n\nOffense level 2 with Frequency level 1 = Punishment level 2\n\nOffense level 3 with Frequency level 1 = Punishment level 3\n\nOffense level 1 with Frequency level 3 = Punishment level 3\n\n\nYou clearly fell into one of the last two examples. Not your logic of \"frequency only matters.\" It's just ironic that you are so sarcastic about people's intelligence.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
