I've tried looking through old board here as well as on other gaming sites to try to fix the problem but none of the solutions I've tried so far have resulted in a permanent fix.  At best my FPS stays solid for a day or two before regressing to the same issues.  I was wondering if there's anything else I could do.  I've already submitted a support ticked but since Rioters in NA are probably just now getting to work I figured I'd try here as well.\n\nSolutions attempted:\n\nDisabling Windows features\nDisabling fullscreen Optimizations\nDisabling Gamebar\nManually disabling game mode\nPlaying in borderless windowed mode\nLowering in-game graphic specifications\nClosing all programs that aren't League\nUpdating/re-installing all drivers\nRunning League of Legends Repair tool\n\nEdit:  I have also attempted adjusting NVIDIA's control panel to prefer Maximum Performance as it's power management mode.  Not that it should matter since I'm running a desktop\n\nAny advice would be much appreciated","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-17T02:55:02.952+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've wracked my brain for a bit now going back and forth on some potential fixes you could try, but it honestly seems like you've exhausted almost every tool this poro has under his belt o_o! \n\nI want to be sure this is looked into sufficiently, and I definitely don't want to steer you in the wrong direction and potentially waste time while waiting on responses here, so please be sure to shoot the steps you've tried (as well as any differences you saw after testing) and some of your game logs over to our techs in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). Once they have that info and your logs they should be able to narrow down what could be causing those frame drops.","replies":[{"poster":"Lasersniped","date":"2018-01-17T04:17:00.958+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks.  I've already been working on a ticket with M0userat and he's having me run some benchmark tests.

You're in good hands there for sure where they can run in-depth tests and look over logs ^_^. Sometimes these things need a much more hands on approach, which can often be difficult here on the boards","replies":[{"poster":"LCK Apdo","date":"2018-01-17T08:34:41.337+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"@Broporo thanks for answering on this issue. @Lasersniped, please keep us updated if you will get some solution.

I seem to have terrible FPS drops, but I'm hanging on windows 7. I have GTX 1080 and i7. I doubt it's this. Patch for Meltdown and Spectre affects performance, but slightly. In other games I loose 10 FPS, mostly open world games.\n\nThis has been issue for a while: https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/lZv6E2Xz-update-on-fps-issues-in-722-and-723\n\nI started experiencing this FPS issue after the last update 8.1. Before the patch I had no problem to be locked at 300 fps with a lot of background apps running and on max. League settings. After this patch, I do have 140 fps and in teamfights it drops to around 80 and higher. Sometimes screen is shuttering. I don't know what's going on with the game after the patch, tried a lot fixes as well, even clean installation of older windows with League 8.1. Experiencing same FPS issues.\n\nI just don't know why didn't we get at least some update on informations about, what's going on. I would like to read at least some small info from Riot.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Neeebo","date":"2018-01-16T23:09:24.594+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been experiencing a ton of lag ever since patch 7.23 as well.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LuCfer","date":"2018-01-16T16:36:38.054+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it has been hapenning to me since patch 7.22(worsened in 7.24)\n  but it comes and goes at will, even  got afk penalties for the game freezing but so far they did nothing","replies":[]}]}
