I notice a bug that made my fps 35-40 and 20 in team fights it did not start for me till mid 6.6 I don&#039;t know what changed from begining to mid if I had to guess the first game my fps was below 80 was with an  midlaner going aurellan sol so I think that  champ may be the one causing the bug. Turning off the audio does not help at all unlike some post suggest pls help this is my only week off due to spring break and I want to play.","replies":[{"poster":"Tg8RCCWpor","date":"2016-04-14T14:35:36.620+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's nothing to do with whether or not Riot 'cares'.  \n\nRiot cannot assume responsibility for this issue without backlash, in the form of breaking service. It's been **five weeks** now.  I've lost one month of gameplay due to malicious neglgance on behalf of he whole Riot team.

I don't have much more info than that, as I'm on the skins team. Buuut, I poked around to at least get some kind of status update.","replies":[{"poster":"zusSILENCER","date":"2016-04-14T08:01:08.957+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have noticed that not only is it the sound that has been affecting my mac but there must be problems in some visuals. I think that this is rooting back to 6.6 because before that I was playing fine at 60+ fps and now I get an average of 45/50 fps. This problem isn't huge for now since I keep sounds at a low volume graphics at low/very low but take note that before 6.6 I was completely fine with medium/high settings without shadows. Anyways hope a rioter reads this and feeds it back to the teams trying to work on a fix.\n\nP.S. Could you put the issue in the client's implemented service status so that we know that a fix isn't available yet and people don't get confused and mad.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-04-17T07:09:27.078+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd be happy to pass that along. \n\nAs opposed to a ticket, we did create a [thread on the boards](http://boards.euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-reports-eu/jT9W0Jc1-16-04-16-update-on-mac-performance-issue) detailing the most up to date information.","replies":[{"poster":"zusSILENCER","date":"2016-04-17T10:12:22.768+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you very much :)","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"ulie love","date":"2016-03-28T05:30:59.573+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The worst part is Riot doesn't even take the time to respond to mac related problems. \nNo Responses, No updates, Nothing to tell us they are looking at it.\nIt's really discouraging","replies":[]},{"poster":"h√≠gh hand","date":"2016-03-28T01:10:15.642+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"almost 1 week, and they haven't fix this yet.","replies":[]},{"poster":"YlmvjOBMpz","date":"2016-04-14T15:31:34.063+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Down vote","replies":[]}]}
