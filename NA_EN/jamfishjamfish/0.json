I was saddened to see that the exclusive alpha icon was only available when logging on before the 15th. I know you guys probably don't do this sort of thing but would it be even remotely possible to still receive the icon? I've been a part of the test for about two months and have reported numerous bugs, I know this is probably too much to ask but I would appreciate it so much if you could. \r\n{{item:3073}}","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-16T03:09:07.033+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You'll probably still get the icon, since you mentioned you had already been using the Alpha Client. I believe that specific messaging was more aimed at players who had just gained access to the Alpha Client. We're still sending these icons out, so I'd recommend you sit tight until we get them all out.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[{"poster":"JamFishJamFish","date":"2017-01-10T22:24:52.066+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No I got it :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sat√Ω","date":"2016-11-16T18:19:16.253+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same, i've been alpha tester and i did log in before the 15th.
