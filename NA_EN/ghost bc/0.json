When you magically get qued for one of those games out of those 30 days where you play 10 a day, just ONE game you get matchmade with a 4 man pre, and die a couple times. instant reset. very valid. much wow. i love having no rewards. thanks riot.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2018-01-22T07:56:38.808+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot said honor 1 and lower will not receive resets.","replies":[{"poster":"Ghost BC","date":"2018-01-22T07:58:42.709+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Does that mean I will never see above honor 0 again?","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2018-01-22T08:01:32.455+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You will as long as you're actually not toxic for a few months.
