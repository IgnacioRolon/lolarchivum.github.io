I think this is the 3rd time now that I've lost a series from this crap. It's not on my end, I still have internet when the game kicks me. I play for hours, get myself back into promos after 4-5 winning games and bam, disconnect and loss. Failed to select a champion. Then it takes so much LP that I have to play 4 games to make up the LP that the two losses gave me. Why is that? I even filmed it happening the second time. This is why I take LONG breaks from this game...it's irritating trying to rank up and lose promos over and over again to dc's by the game. Pretty damn irritating.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-16T16:33:00.442+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Disconnecting during a ranked or promotion is a coincidence, albeit a crappy one.  Your network might be having hiccups or trouble staying connection, so it's important to get that taken care of to prevent further issues like this.  Go over each step in our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to resolve this for good.  I also recommend testing it out in custom games for now, until you're sure it's good to go.  Best of luck in your next games!","replies":[{"poster":"SifuJoe","date":"2016-08-16T20:06:33.573+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry to burst your bubble, but being an IT specialist, I can tell you it's not on my end. I've tried it on both the wired connection and also over my phone through verizon and it's happened on both connections. I never lose internet on either one. The only thing that happens is that the game hangs and sits idle until I get kicked. I've also ran it while playing videos and pandora at the same time and those have NEVER gone out either. Care to explain how it's on the client side when nothing on the client side stops? As far as a conflict with the game is concerned, these are issues that never occur otherwise except during my promos, usually (I did get kicked shortly after my above post during a regular draft game). Also, this has occurred in 5 different parts of the country as I have traveled...are ALL of those networks to blame too? If you want to get into testing while the game is going, I can film and run connection tests and post them if you'd like as this occurs. Please let me know which application you trust that has a constant connection to verify that my connection times out/fails? Let's nip this thing in the bud and see which one of us is in denial, shall we?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-16T20:51:52.663+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"There are *a ton* of network factors that go into play when determining whether you'll maintain a great connection to the servers over a period of time. Though we can't take a look at your entire set of logs, I'd like you to run a traceroute during a period when you're experiencing the connection drops. This traceroute will give us an in-depth look at your routing along the way to the server.\n\nI recommend using the [WinMTR application](http://winmtr.net) with the test IP 104.160.131.1 and running the trace for about 5 minutes. After 5 minutes has passed, export your results as text and paste them here.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[{"poster":"SifuJoe","date":"2016-08-16T22:23:58.633+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, there are a TON of factors that go into a great connection, I agree. I can run the tracert and it will show certain nods that lag behind others and you can say that is where the problem is depending on the latency at each nod and the number of dropped packets. ALL of this just proves my point however. One, you just told me you KNOW there are nod issues going from certain parts of the country to you. The fact that you don't put a system in place to monitor this and address it is the problem. Do you have to? No. It's your game. However, don't try and put it off that it's not your issue too. There is software out there to monitor for problems of this kind. Hell, you could even make your own...uhh humm, Leavebuster that could see if the client was closed forcefully or timed out. Just saying. When we say that the issue is not client side, we are saying that it's not on our end. It's in route to your servers or directly at your servers. Without seeing your logs, I couldn't say for sure where the problem is but it's irritating when you get timed out and it's not your fault. You can argue that nods that time out are not your fault either since you don't own them or control them, but you should recognize this does occur and not penalize the player when it does. If I don't dodge in games, there should be a system in place to restore my standing when it occurs during ranked games, especially promos. Will some people that don't dodge take advantage of this during a series...maybe. So what? NO ONE but me cares if I move up in rank. Only in tournaments would anyone care about ranks but those are on a closed system, like I used to help setup and run during CPLs. For the honest player though, having this happen REPEATEDLY is so frustrating! Most times during promos, you have afk people or trolls. But to not even connect to the game to play and be given an automatic loss and losing 23 LP is a pain in the arse. Here are my initial tracert reports using the program and IP you requested. These are static tests where nothing else is running but the test. From now on, I'll be running that program every time I play to see where the breakdown is. If it's on my end, I'll post that so others know it's not server side. If it's on your end, I'll post that too so that we can try and fix these problems. There are MANY people having these issues so this is important for everyone- the player and Riot- to find the solution. Thank you for your time. \n\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                      WinMTR statistics                                   |\n|                                          Host              -   %  | Sent | Recv | Best | Avrg | Wrst | Last |\n|------------------------------------------------|------|------|------|------|------|------|\n|                                    router.asus.com -    0 |  451 |  451 |    0 |    0 |    9 |    1 |\n|                                            192.168.0.1 -    1 |  447 |  446 |    1 |    1 |   18 |    2 |\n|                                          10.197.128.1 -    0 |  451 |  451 |   10 |   55 |  181 |   74 |\n|             ten0-1-1-3.orld07-ser1.bhn.net -    0 |  451 |  451 |   10 |   55 |  183 |   78 |\n|           ten0-10-0-9.orld71-car1.bhn.net -    0 |  451 |  451 |   11 |   57 |  187 |   81 |\n|          hun0-2-0-5.ORLD71-cbr1.bhn.net -    0 |  451 |  451 |   13 |   58 |  193 |   82 |\n|                                            4.68.70.153 -    0 |  451 |  451 |   10 |   57 |  189 |   79 |\n|                       No response from host -  100 |   91 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |\n|                                             4.14.27.102 -    0 |  451 |  451 |   38 |   84 |  213 |  105 |\n|                                      104.160.135.35 -    0 |  451 |  451 |   37 |   83 |  207 |  101 |\n|             ae32-br02.chi01.riotdirect.net -    0 |  451 |  451 |   47 |   90 |  223 |  111 |\n|               ae1-br01.chi01.riotdirect.net -    0 |  451 |  451 |   46 |   92 |  219 |  114 |\n|                                       104.160.131.1 -    0 |  451 |  451 |   45 |   90 |  220 |  112 |\n|________________________________________________|______|______|______|______|______|______|\n   WinMTR v0.92 GPL V2 by Appnor MSP - Fully Managed Hosting & Cloud Provider\n\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                      WinMTR statistics                                   |\n|                       Host              -   %  | Sent | Recv | Best | Avrg | Wrst | Last |\n|------------------------------------------------|------|------|------|------|------|------|\n|                                     router.asus.com -    0 |  301 |  301 |    0 |    0 |    3 |    0 |\n|                                            192.168.0.1 -    0 |  301 |  301 |    1 |    1 |   27 |    1 |\n|                                           10.197.128.1 -    0 |  301 |  301 |    9 |   54 |  132 |   24 |\n|              ten0-1-1-3.orld07-ser1.bhn.net -    0 |  301 |  301 |   11 |   55 |  135 |   27 |\n|           ten0-10-0-9.orld71-car1.bhn.net -    0 |  301 |  301 |   12 |   56 |  142 |   24 |\n|          hun0-2-0-5.ORLD71-cbr1.bhn.net -    0 |  301 |  301 |   12 |   57 |  144 |   16 |\n|                                            4.68.70.153 -    0 |  301 |  301 |   12 |   56 |  137 |   27 |\n|                       No response from host -  100 |   61 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |\n|                                             4.14.27.102 -    0 |  301 |  301 |   37 |   83 |  173 |   42 |\n|                                      104.160.135.35 -    0 |  301 |  301 |   38 |   82 |  162 |   48 |\n|              ae32-br02.chi01.riotdirect.net -    0 |  301 |  301 |   46 |   90 |  174 |   52 |\n|                ae1-br01.chi01.riotdirect.net -    0 |  301 |  301 |   46 |   90 |  174 |   58 |\n|                                        104.160.131.1 -    0 |  301 |  301 |   45 |   89 |  169 |   63 |\n|________________________________________________|______|______|______|______|______|______|\n   WinMTR v0.92 GPL V2 by Appnor MSP - Fully Managed Hosting & Cloud Provider","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-16T23:27:13.053+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's certainly frustrating when you're disconnecting from a match or champion select, however, regardless of intent, the disconnection negatively affects everyone in it.

It's possible your modem is malfunctioning, but at the very least, there are issues that your ISP tech support should look into.
