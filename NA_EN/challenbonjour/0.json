There have been times in ranked where someone or a couple people would be obviously trolling like feeding intentionally, taking lanes even though lanes are assigned in ranked, or just being toxic, but even after all of this, these toxic or bad players would pose in all chat as if they&#039;re the victims. Once end game lobby opens up, they would victimize themselves along with the other troll if there is one and I would get falsely reported. How can I avoid this because I don&#039;t want to get banned and it is really frustrating because those who deserve to be banned or suspended turn the attention towards me or those who are trying to call them out so they don&#039;t end up getting reported.","replies":[{"poster":"Bronze 6 Yasuo","date":"2018-01-10T09:22:43.980+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe don't do anything bad?","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Cream Reaper","date":"2018-01-10T09:24:42.054+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"you don't get banned for false reports. you get banned for right ones. it doesn't matter how many people report you or how often it happens. all that matters is how YOU handle YOURSELF. if your chat is clean and you didn't do anything too obviously trollish, you're good!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Le Meme","date":"2018-01-10T16:25:59.350+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So, I have this issue, but I can't say I'm perfect. I do say witty things back to trolls or toxic people. I do deserve punishment to an extent. With that being said, my resolution for this issue is just don't talk. if someone is trolling in champ select and are taking lanes hostage before the match even starts, just dodge. the 5 - 30 minute wait will be no where as tilting as playing with the said person for 20+ minutes. your energy and outlook on life is too precious to throw away for them. Now if you happen to make it into a game with someone that is trolling or being toxic just don't say anything. Trolls don't run on gas but instead your emotions. if you try to cheer them up or encourage them to do good theyll turn it back around on you. So, let them sulk and deal with their problems in the way they do... ( sadly its ruining our days ) then report them. Hopefully riot ( or just us as a society ) can fix this issue.  League is supposed to be a place of happiness and friendly competition. Not an emotional battleground.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Peritheus","date":"2018-01-10T13:22:19.694+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe smash your keyboard into pieces and play with just a controller or mouse? ( Basically muted yourself) \nListen 1 single bad word even if they are in the wrong will get your cheeks clapped, dry, as they only provide logs that well is 1 sided and blind perspective, anyway haven't you heard? People who've been reported nowadays never ever talk once in the game anymore, even if they are a chatty fellow, because they get reported and punished for the stupidest amount of insecurity this screwed generation has nowadays, like just saying the word ez, ?, or report is taboo and viewed and deemed toxic, crazy right? lol and get this they get talk to like a lawyer discussing their case before the judge and generally always lose. why? Because nobody wants to view 60 mins etc amount of chat log messages through the 50k? reports every month. even if you were right, a small offense is still a offense you can't change that, only work on improving yourself and be cautiously prepared next time, but even then if you do keep it up like that... you'll snap heheheehhhehehafshfhuashfaihfwiuqfwicaifovn *Hugglepuffs my rumplestump* \n\nAnyway, basically TLDR: There's no winning, you either be ever vigilant and report any toxicity then eventually be punished, be silent and mute everything/ watch the same fate happen to others, or better you snap just like them who trolled you and play the victims reporting you, it's an everlasting cycle, it's rare to see anyone overcome and if they do, welp, They are probably one of the few un/lucky most amazing people in the world capable of breaking apart from the fate of the human race that repeats its mistakes for eternity. and so time again will happen, 1 of you reported will have the same post and I hope, there's at least 1 comment different from the rest that'll inspire you, but you can't do it by yourself, mankind can't defy fate by themselves, only interfere with others.   I'm just kidding dude ;p Who rights down and thinks about this type of corny philosophic mumbo jumbo stuff psshu.","replies":[]}]}
