Seriously ridiculous, there is no such thing as hate speech anyway, words are words and are NOT violence, and you liberal snowflakes are ruining america. This is what the damn chat filter is for, turn it on if your feel feels are paper thin.\r\n\r\nThe system used to be nice and reasonable where it would go from a warning to 1 day then 3 days then 7, 14, 1 month, 3 month, 6 month, perma. That is way more fair and balanced like fox news. Now you just get exploded instantly with zero warning or anything, and now im seeing that the only 2 ban lengths are 14 days and perma? That&#039;s literally insane and i feel like i have to start a new smurf to get away from that possibility since people report for everything.\r\n\r\nTriHard Cx","replies":[{"poster":"Chermorg","date":"2017-06-30T02:10:36.065+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's not stupid.\n\nYou used a slur that was used for **hundreds of years** to make people, **mainly slaves**, feel like they were lesser and worthless **because of their skin color**.
