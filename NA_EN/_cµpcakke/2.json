Nope her true dmg was still equaling up to 354 which (my hp at lvl 18 was 2533) and tumbled so much i couldnt even see her. So why doesnt exhaust reduce her true damage? I get that its max hp damage but it reduces 40% of all damage dealt so she shouldve been dealing 141 true dmg not 345.","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-04-20T20:32:47.014+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Because it's true damage.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Who Fed Ru","date":"2019-04-20T20:32:24.124+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Because it's true damage?","replies":[]},{"poster":"hiyares","date":"2019-04-20T21:03:11.747+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the problem is true damage is made to force you to stack hp for things like pyke or darius the problem with vaynes true damage is its %healh based so if true damage were to get nerfed in that sense darius would fall even lower in power and technically your exhuast slows vayne down reducing the true damage slightly.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2019-04-20T20:34:56.686+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"If what the others said didn't explain it, True Damage by definition cannot be reduced.
