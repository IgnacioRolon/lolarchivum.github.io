I'm just wondering what the average ticket wait times are these days. I aint rushing anything. I would just like to know since I think my main account was compromised. (My own fault for needing time away to study) If anyone knows what the time for a specialist that would be most handy. I did do a stupid move yesterday and add move info so...yeah. I would like to go back into the game and enjoy it again. Ah well till then back to the waiting game.","replies":[{"poster":"Come to Life","date":"2017-02-11T02:44:05.259+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"wait time is about 8 hours.

My wait time was about 8 hours each reply.","replies":[{"poster":"Come to Life","date":"2017-02-11T02:44:54.900+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"P.S. i dont think they will be solving this one.

Our queues aren't too high right now so it shouldn't take long.  If you've waited for a bit, I'm happy to check on your status if you've got a ticket number.  I hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
