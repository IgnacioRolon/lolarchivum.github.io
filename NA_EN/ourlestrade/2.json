Is there gonna be a proper mechanically intensive support champion one day full of flashy manoeuvres that could make people blush? Or are supports always gonna be simple for the most part, since most support players are last picks with no idea how to support so they need lots of simple champions?\n\nI&#039;ve been waiting for the day that we could finally do something like your Yasuos and Zeds and junk, and over the past few years nothing&#039;s really tickled that itch. The Taric rework&#039;s skill cap is a skillshot and pressing your ult at the right time, Tahm Kench is just a walking targeted W, Bard is the Singed of supports whose one real trick is stunning you when you follow him... Am I alone here? :/\n\nRant over, I apologise. Seeing the ten billionth video of all these champions flying around and doing flashy things while support champions sort of just sit around with no real way to compete and have their own fun gets to me every so often :( (This isn't some bloke wanting damage on supports. I just want something that feels rewarding to invest time into learning all the angles of instead of one trick ponies. Not another immobile glacier or sitting duck for the next dubstep montage)","replies":[{"poster":"legionnaire99","date":"2016-07-09T22:01:14.873+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thresh bard","replies":[]},{"poster":"VoidStaresBack","date":"2016-07-10T06:54:27.035+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem with flashy, character-mechanics-intensive playstyles is that they aren't very conducive to keeping another player alive.

What I mean is that I've never really felt like I had much \"play\" potential when it came to dealing with the enemy. While some random assassin is flying around, my peel as Taric amounts to \"I pressed Q, W and Face of the Mountain while my Kalista dodged left and right and did some really flashy high skill cap stuff\". Or if I'm in a big team fight as Braum \"I stood there with my shield up and everyone did sick mechanics around me\". You never really see montages for supports because they lack this dimension of playmaking. Hell, speaking of Braum he's the only support with an actual method of mobility that isn't just a movement speed boost through his W.\n\nIt's really hard to explain what I'm getting at, and I've had people mock me in the past for it. Am I making sense? :O","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2016-07-09T22:20:56.244+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It makes sense that you'd want that, but those tools just generally aren't helpful in supporting another player.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Too Ton","date":"2016-07-09T22:20:18.803+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreeing with ppl who write thresh","replies":[]},{"poster":"xWaters","date":"2016-07-09T22:08:29.355+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thresh is the only support where I've had comments from both teams about a play I've made.
