First of all when i am in the champion select often client stop working and i can't choose/ban a champion so in ranked i lose lp , others time i can choose and ban a champion but when the game has to start it dosn't start , i see in the chat others player leaving the room but i can't proceed ; so i close the client and i launch it again but i can't reconnect to the match cause i met a error so rightly my teammates choose to remake and i can't do anything . So i lose lp and i gain a \"wonderfull\" leaver buster for 5 games about 20 minutes pls answer me and help me to solve this enormous problem . Thanks .","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-07T19:49:04.518+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you might have an unstable connection that lose sync during champion select and left you behind.  This would result in a [queue dodge](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751844-Queue-Dodging) and the timer would just be for one game.  I suggest going through the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to fix this up.  Losing your connection like this, even if not intentional, causes others a negative experience and can result in an escalated timer.  Let me know if that clears things up!","replies":[{"poster":"PaperFeather","date":"2017-04-19T13:46:10.892+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi and thanks for the reply i will try as you say beacause i am getting this problem quite often .","replies":[]}]}]}
