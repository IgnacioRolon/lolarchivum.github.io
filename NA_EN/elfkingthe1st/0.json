My name is ElfKingthe1st. I recently got into my first promos to B4 (even though i won 7/10 provisional and had S- or higher in 6 of the games) and I just got suspended for 14 days. Obviously, this makes me sad, but it also makes me angry. There was one game in the chat logs area, and was suspended for my &quot;toxicity&quot;. However, it was my first promo. We were off to a good start. Then my team decided to throw for some reason, seemingly running into enemies at random. This made me a little angry. Then our adc decided to afk. Then I was VERY angry. I flamed my team, and now I&#039;m banned because of that game. I can guarantee that none of the other throwers/afks in the game were banned. Just my thoughts. These kind of events make me want to quit League.","replies":[{"poster":"ƒæµ","date":"2016-03-12T02:41:25.553+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Regardless of other players behavior you seem to admit yours was toxic and abusive so I dont see why you are angry you got banned? Also if you are in bronze 5 there is 0 reason to blame team. Players in bronze 5 literally cant get any worse, so you should not rely on them to do anything.\n\nGoing to have to carry yourself out and be responsible for your own behavior.","replies":[{"poster":"III BAKURYU III ","date":"2016-03-12T03:15:49.978+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bronze 5 players don't know right from wrong.  ( I'm not saying if your Bronze you suck)  but if your bronze 5 there should be no reason to depend on your team to do the right things.  Don't flame anymore either it makes no difference their going to do what they want to do so no reason to communicate or even speak to them in chat mute everyone and just do your best if your best isn't good enough just keep improving.  \nSorry for your ban it sucks but you just gotta react better next time.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Evewynn","date":"2016-03-12T03:57:03.000+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It can be hard to keep your cool under the pressure of ranked, especially promos. Unfortunately, there is little excuse for toxicity regardless of the situation. It was definitely not okay for your teammates to go off the deep end like that, am I am sure that they will receive what it coming to them if they do not improve their behavior, if they haven't been punished already. \n\ni hope that you take the 14 days less as a restriction and more as an opportunity to step back and reflect on how you can improve your behavior and make better ways for yourself to handle these situations that many can relate to being just horrible. Everything's a learning experience, right? Corny, I know, but it's true.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nik Nikerson","date":"2016-03-12T02:22:27.017+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well did you report the other players?","replies":[]}]}
