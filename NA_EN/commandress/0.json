I began in season 6 and i got gold 5, i unlocked Victorious Maokai and had just found out that those skins exist. I've desired for the Morgana skin for a LOOOOONG time now, but I keep seeing that It's not available anymore, is there like any form or special way i can still get it?","replies":[{"poster":"MysterQ","date":"2017-12-01T23:14:21.821+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":":( not right now.\n\nMaybe, if someone popular asks.\nRiot should give \"Victorious Tokens\" for each queue. Then you can purchase any Victorious Skin/Chroma. Imo that would be a good way.
