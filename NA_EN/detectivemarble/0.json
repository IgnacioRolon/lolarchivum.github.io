Its not at all right if a player gets permabanned even though they recieved no warnings, or no way of scaling the warnings. For instance, someones account got chat restricted for 1k games instead of just a permaban 10,25,permaban is how mine went.","replies":[{"poster":"Dominick Destine","date":"2016-11-26T20:18:35.734+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=DetectiveMarble,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=EqPyMbEt,comment-id=00090000000000000000000000010000000000000000,timestamp=2016-11-26T19:27:58.821+0000)\n>\n> what do you mean &quot;even by my own admission&quot;?\n\nYou told us you were punished multiple times with incremental disciplinary action.

I got chat banned twice for 10 then 25 games and thats about it. Personally I dont have a problem with getting a temporary ban however long it may be. Imo and the opinions of others I should&#x27;ve been given a 2 week ban. A perma ban for talking shit in two games is a bit much wouldnt you say? Again, the last time i got an actual suspension from league was over two years ago. And in one of the games which was the cause to my perma I shit talked the enemy team. And the idea of &quot;he shit talked me first&quot; Is a pretty valid one. In the court of law if someone attacks you then you are allowed to fight back aka self defense. If all of these people started it and I ended it why should I get a perma? Its a pretty childish idea but its a relatively valid one. If theres some entitled little shit on my team and hes calling everybody else trash im going to flame him because hes a dickhead. I shouldn&#x27;t have had no warning pre-perma All these comments in here saying &quot;if you trash talk you deserve a ban&quot; is sort of narrow minded. Considering I said I did not have a problem with being temporarily banned. Let me say it again so that anyone else who sees this can know i said it \n> I DO NOT HAVE A PROBLEM WITH BEING TEMPORARILY BANNED.\n\nThere is a difference between self defense and vigilantism","replies":[{"poster":"DetectiveMarble","date":"2016-11-24T22:58:52.443+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Anything I say after he talks shit is self defense.

He shot me in the stomach, I shot him in the arm so he can't shoot anymore, self defense. Doing the same as he did is not self defense. Muting him or arguing in a non toxic Way so s self defense.

I would never advocate this.  It is unethical, and a clear violation of the legal agreement that all players make with Riot games.  While Riot might not think it worthwhile to sue someone over a $50 RP chargeback, it doesn't change the fact that they legally can do it.  And should they decide to do so, not only would they win the case, the person sued would be responsible for all the legal fees involved.\n\nThis is a direct quote from the Terms of Use, which everyone agrees to when they click \"I Agree.\":\n\n4.3.
