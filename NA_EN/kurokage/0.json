It was all nice until about 20. minute when fights started. In one particular fight I went in with 3 stacks on stun. Then I used E and immediately R after. Guess what, no one got stunned. It happened 3 times, and it basically lost the match. I just want to know why is that happening. {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} \r\n\r\nThis better get fixed soon!\r\n\r\nWith love, Silver scrub.","replies":[{"poster":"Decrit","date":"2016-09-13T16:16:13.069+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let me guess.\n\nYou used molten shield followed after by a damaging spell, did not you?\n\nthat now does not stack anymore her passive, if i remember correctly","replies":[{"poster":"Kurokage","date":"2016-09-13T20:40:47.659+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes I did, but Molten Shield adds one stack.
