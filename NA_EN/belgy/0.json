I did the initial install but then it has to do the setup in the application. The first time I did this it went to 27% and crashed. I had to restart my computer, then I tried again. It has been over 4 hours since then and it is only at 71% it has been making slow progress and doesn’t show signs of stoping but it is incredibly frustrating. I’ve had no issues like this with other games. Does anyone know what the problem is and how I might be able to fix it?","replies":[{"poster":"Son of Ornn","date":"2018-01-05T04:28:24.053+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do want to caution that sometimes the installation or even patches can LOOK like they're going nowhere when they're really just taking their time and doing their job. I am a little less willing to believe everything's fine though given you said it got interrupted before and it's taken 4 hours. I do have some solutions to try if your patch is still taking a bit too long.\n\nFirst, I implore you to hook up a wired connection over wifi in case you aren't already since that's going to make things faster and more consistent. Next, you should make sure that your firewall or AV program isn't getting freaked out and tries to block LoL. [**Follow this link**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#wq3) for some direction on how to bypass that potential block, then try to reinstall again! Let me know if it still took forever or got interrupted. :)","replies":[]}]}
