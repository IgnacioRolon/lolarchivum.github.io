So it seems a little bit extraordinary~\r\nAbout her hair: Syndra mostly has her hair floating behind her, so to fit that scheme you couId add a nebula veil. But personally I think it looks better without it.\r\nA little additional idea are her complete black eyes, to make her look more like an alien. I think that would be reeeally cool!\r\n\r\nMask:\r\nhttp://fs5.directupload.net/images/151215/cwfulal9.png\r\nI dont know why I drew this, but at least you can see how the veil is attached to the mask.\r\nA very important thing to me is, that the gem on her forehead is the sign of the sun.\r\nIt&#039;s because her spheres are planets which surround her costantly. It makes sense.\r\nI also covered her ears with gemlike objects, because Syndras ears are also always covered with something.\r\n\r\nAbilities:\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/3MUepUu.png\r\nAuto: could be falling stars or also mini meteors.\r\nSpheres: I know there are no blueish, purple, glowing planets, but it should fit to the colors.\r\nQ: I want the planet to appear with a big bang-like explosion. Then the cornfield sings appear on the ground.\r\nW: When she grabs her planet it should look like the milky way.\r\nE: The first idea is that it looks like a star rain. The second idea looks like these cornfield signs again.\r\nR: The planets turn into meteors and attack the target.\r\n\r\nThe last thing, of which I didnt make a concept art of, is the recall animation:\r\nYou probably know this typical alien thing when they steal cows. A light cone appears an they float up.\r\nSomething like this with Syndra would be funny~\r\n\r\nThats about it.\r\nWhat do you think?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Ve1vet","date":"2015-12-15T17:51:52.022+0000","up_votes":37,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah very cool, its always awesome to see VFX studies along with a skin concept- they're so essential to a thematic like this.\n\nThat space veil is gorgeous, and am I seeing some anti-spiral Nia inspiration in the arms and legs? :) Lovely work!","replies":[{"poster":"Fasmodey","date":"2015-12-15T18:22:09.320+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot Ve1vet,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=0ExmWcU3,comment-id=0017,timestamp=2015-12-15T17:51:52.022+0000)\n>\n> Ah very cool, its always awesome to see VFX studies along with a skin concept- they're so essential to a thematic like this.\n> \n> That space veil is gorgeous, and am I seeing some anti-spiral Nia inspiration in the arms and legs? :) Lovely work!\n\nI will lose my faith if we don't get Cosmic Reaver Syndra in the future.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nawlien","date":"2015-12-15T20:21:33.237+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aww, I'm so glad~\nActually I didn't know anti-spiral Nia till now, but you're right they look similar~ \n\nThanks to all of you, I'm really grateful for your feedback and it makes me happy to see that you guys like it.~","replies":[{"poster":"Mistress Madoka","date":"2015-12-16T08:16:17.752+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If it were tweaked to add some more purposeful-yet-vague AntiSpiral Nia reference, You could list it as \"Super Galaxy Syndra\"\n\nBut no srsly this is awesome, good work,","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Blainezy","date":"2015-12-15T22:19:12.384+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot Ve1vet,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=0ExmWcU3,comment-id=0017,timestamp=2015-12-15T17:51:52.022+0000)\n>\n> Ah very cool, its always awesome to see VFX studies along with a skin concept- they're so essential to a thematic like this.\n> \n> That space veil is gorgeous, and am I seeing some anti-spiral Nia inspiration in the arms and legs? :) Lovely work!\n\nLegendary Syndra skin pl0x!!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"What Is An Meta","date":"2015-12-15T10:50:48.535+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would literally give {{champion:6}} a blowjob to get this skin made for real.","replies":[{"poster":"Supreme Senpai69","date":"2015-12-16T11:46:01.855+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just threw up in my mouth a little. \n\nUpvoted","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"blackbeltblasian","date":"2015-12-15T00:17:16.811+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love it, best Syndra concept I've seen personally.
