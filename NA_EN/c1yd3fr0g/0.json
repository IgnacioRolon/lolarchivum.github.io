I get about 1 minute into a game and league completely freezes and I need to do a hard restart on my computer. This has happened every time for the past two weeks. I've played league on this comp since late 2015 with no problems. Yesterday, I did a factory reset on my MBA. Before reinstalling everything from my external hard drive, I downloaded league and attempted to play a game. First game, 1 minute in and total freeze/crash again! :( \r\n\r\nThe fact I have come to a forum for help shows how desperate I am. I travel constantly for work so I cannot play console games anymore which has made league my only gaming getaway. I'm considering buying a new comp but that would take all of my money so that'd be a last option... \r\n\r\nSpecs: OS X Yosemite 10.10.5\r\n1.6 GHz Intel Core i5\r\nIntel HD Graphics 6000 1536mb\r\n\r\nIt would be greatly appreciated if someone could assist me. Thank you.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-03-27T22:35:08.358+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Before you run out to buy a new computer (unless you're offering me as well xD), it sounds like your client might be freezing due to an outdated driver. For example, if your graphics driver is out of date and it has a hard time loading a specific game asset, your comp might not be able to work past that hang-up and just freezes completely. \n\nLook over our [FPS Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting#wq1) and double check for any missing driver updates. Let me know how that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"C1yd3Fr0g","date":"2017-03-28T04:30:21.873+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Macs don't use graphics drivers. Everything suggested under that thread about Macs would've been resolved when I factory reset the computer. Do you think it has something to do with the recent patch?
