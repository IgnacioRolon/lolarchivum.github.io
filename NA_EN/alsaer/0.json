All they will do the entire game is spam games. It is torture. I think it would be a really good idea to make another button next to the mute button that looks like a flag or something like that it would work exactly like the mute button. Another idea would be to make the mute button also mute pings. However, it might not be good for people that are just toxic or annoying, but their pings are perfectly fine. I'd like to know what other people think about this.","replies":[{"poster":"Erratan","date":"2014-11-27T06:33:40.673+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with this thread, I know it's a bit old, but perhaps It should be revisited. Pings are useful, yet 1 ping will suffice, two for urgency, 3 at most. But when there's 6-8 rapid pings, I know I get frustrated and have to turn off sound in case it happens again.\n\nAnother problem I'd like to note, I've got a good computer and good internet. BUT, occasionally, lag happens, especially if windows decides to update without telling me in the background (not uncommon). This rapid-fire ping method that some players like to use had caused lag spikes in game for me, which is an issue NOT solved by muting my speakers.\n\nAlso of note: most of the players who ping like this are toxic or borderline toxic. They think that they know the game better than anyone, and can do whatever they wish. Asking them to stop I fruitless.\n\nFinally I'd like to mention a related game that involved this recently. After dealing with lag caused by these ping spikes, I've been informed by a player during the results chat (that I muted in chat during game) that he was going to report me for \"Failing to communicate with the team\". The ignore/mute function exists, but if a player is even REPORT-worthy for using it, then the function shouldn't exist at all. I know that the report selection is intended for other circumstances, but perhaps could be phrased... better?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sparrow007","date":"2014-10-28T06:18:22.577+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the ability to mute peoples pings is completely necessary. I can't ask someone to please lay off the pings without getting 5 more pings in reply. I have to mute the entire game because I can't stand the sound of someone pingpingpinging constantly. The argument that I've seen most repeatedly is that I need the pings to be able to effectively communicate with my team, but turning all sound off effectively kills a whole lot more than my ability to communicate with the cat that's already trolling me. I don't understand why turning individual or all pings off is impossible. If a person doesn't use the pinging system effectively or decides to quit listening to pings altogether it should reflect in their elo instead of how it is now; which is just take their trolling pings or take your headphones off.\nI'm not sure if this is an old thread or not but it is a topic near and dear to my heart.

This is probably the reasoning behind the idea of letting muted people still ping in the first place. But the actual outcome usually is just an alternative for the toxic player to continiue his harassment.\n\nI honestly believe that even toxic people can do some usefull pings too sometimes. But judging by my experience, most of my games this simply isn't the case. So in my opinion, you should at the very least be able to mute both the chat and the pings seperately. But I wouldn't mind just adding it back to the standard mute function.\n\nAlso, I had another Idea. I think it might be a good idead to show each player, how many people have ignored him in each game. A Simple counter 0-9 would do the trick. You don't even have to mention who it was. \nThe advantages I see are as follows:\nFor one it would be a direct feedback to people who are toxic and if it were to happen in several games the same day, they might see, that they are on tilt. \nAnd also these toxic players will know, that they don't need to spam pings or rage in the chat, as they know people won't be hearing/reading it anyway.  \n\nWell, that's my 2 cents on the topic for now. Just felt the need to commet here after just having 2 more games with people spaming rage pings all game long. :(","replies":[]},{"poster":"Subarashi","date":"2015-02-23T01:13:33.864+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree: The ping system needs an update in my opinion.\nThere will always be toxic players BUT I guess Rito could make the league world a better place if they updated the ping system. I am AGAINST the idea of SUKISHOO because there are people who write crap in chat but you can have a very decent communication via pings. So If I mute a player, I don't wanna mute their pings! I AGREE with ERRATIN: 1 ping will suffice, two for urgency, no more than 3.\n\n**So I wish for** something like an automatic ping block. If you ping more than 4 times withing 5 seconds (same sort of ping), you should automatically be disabled to ping within the next 20 seconds. Moreover, If you ping far more than the avarage amount of pings (well, I guess Riot has already statistics on that since they have statistics on everything >.< ). you could get ping restricted. I meanthe chat restriction is very recreative for the league community so why not impose a restriction for pings? *.*\n\nI can also imagine a general ping restriction. For example you only have 50 pings (again, this is just guessed)  per game and per player. Do you think this could work?","replies":[]},{"poster":"QuestForFreedom","date":"2016-06-21T00:56:55.481+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bump","replies":[]},{"poster":"IcyPepper","date":"2015-02-23T01:17:05.968+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can already adjust ping volume :V","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sukishoo","date":"2014-08-31T16:13:10.025+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think they should just make it that when you mute a person in game it mutes all actions related to that person (text, pings, ect).
