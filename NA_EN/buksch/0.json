After the text was sent to me I was shocked at the reasons for a permanent ban. It is ridiculous that swearing in a gaming chat room is not acceptable, especially given you player demographic and other similar gaming conversations. If this is truly the way RIOT would like to operate then I would rather not play this game and suggest the same to my large group of friends who join me. The fact that you so rapidly condemn any mention of homosexuality but the entire cast of your champions is sexualized beyond acceptable measure for a company with the upmost concerns towards &quot;equality&quot; and appropriateness in confusing. Please remember this is a GAME and not a children&#039;s cartoon. I would like to have the tribunals review appealed.
