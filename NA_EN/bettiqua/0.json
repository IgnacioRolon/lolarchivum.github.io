It's something I spend a good amount of time reading up on whenever they come out with something new, or when the mood strikes, and I enjoy thinking about the possibilities for all the different stories in the world. But sometimes it's during that daydreaming that I get a little sad at the thought that, because of the always-updating-but-generally-_status-quo-keeping_ League of Legends' gameplay model, it'd be a little hard to have any cool, dramatic events or anything to happen in the lore that didn't hugely impact the game somehow (like how Gangplank \"died\" in the Bilgewater update, but didn't actually die, since that'd call for removing him from the game, lol).\r\n\r\nSo I got around to thinking—what would need to happen for there to be large-scale events to happen in Runeterra without affecting League of Legends too much? And what I finally came up with was why not make another game? Something like an RPG, maybe? \r\n\r\nNow, obviously no game company just simply _makes a whole new game_. Riot's always constantly having to worry about balancing League as is, while making new characters/working on champion reworks in the process. But I was thinking specifically of the Star Guardian event with the special PvE game mode. I _loved_ that game mode. It was really fun to just play with some friends and not worry about anyone getting tilted or anything because someone on the enemy team did or said something obnoxious. (Well, there was some swearing at some rather persistent Voidlings, but...) I would be just as happy with the League of Legends gameplay/engine in a League-universe-based RPG as I would with a whole new game design.\r\n\r\nIt just feels like a shame that the creative department puts so much effort and care into these characters and into this world, but a lot of people don't really notice it. It has so much potential to be something great, but it's limited by the game itself. So, a game where the only limit is the team's imagination? I'd absolutely _love_ to see that.\r\n\r\nTL;DR:\r\nLeague of Legends has such a rich lore that it just seems sad to not have a separate experience dedicated to it, don'tcha think? I'm not trying to demand it or anything, it's totally up to Riot. I guess I just wanted to express interest in it, let Riot know that there'd be _some_ people who'd love it, you know?","replies":[]}
