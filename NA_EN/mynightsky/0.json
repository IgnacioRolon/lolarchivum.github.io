Heres what happened .\r\n\r\nI usually leave league up on my computer. I left for a few hours and came back. I had left a lobby up but it was ready to que, so I hit start que or whatever is at the bottom. Well, nothing was happening.... so i closed league and tried to bring it up again. Entered in my log in info and its just sat there like it was loading, but wasnt. So i closed it again, and tried it again.
