Bronze V is only hell or heaven depending on your mindset. As long as you try to get better, you will rise through the ranks anyways. If you feel you're ranked too low, just play carry champions and learn to carry the game there. \n\nBeing able to play every (or almost every) role and having some champions to choose from is important though if you want to start ranked.
