I just wanted to give you a quick update on where we are with skin bio release cadence, but first I want to talk about our philosophy behind them.\r\n\r\nSkin bios (or \"skin descriptions”) is a product I pitched two years ago when we first created the Skin Collections Tab. The original idea for the tab was that it’d be a cool way to categorize skins, and it’d also be fun for people who like to collect things to see what they were missing. I pitched that it’d ALSO be an amazing way to show players some of the “head canon” we had for skins like Blood Moon and Program (many people didn’t know it was part of the PROJECT universe) and also a cool way to make brand new alternate universes. Also it would be fun, because I personally have always loved browsing skins in games and reading flavor text on things. I got to work categorizing skins with a team of writers and concept artists. We got through about 25% of the skins before we realized more skins had no \"story\" or even connective tissue. Some splashes had easter eggs to things that were \"internal lore\" while others just had something random and funny in the background. We had to dig through ancient Boards posts to see what the original marketing material was. \r\n\r\nBut it was worth it because a lot of you guys have become really invested in some of these skin sets! That makes us really happy. I love seeing the community theorycraft about a \"skinline\" that, to be honest, was just a collection of skins. Something I've had to explain a bit on Twitter is that the vast majority of skin sets are still simply that: a set of skins for the Skins Collection Tab that also happen to have flavor text. They aren’t considered “full universes.” Only the skins listed in the [Universe](https://universe.leagueoflegends.com/en_US/) page are skins we consider to have full alternate universe lore.\r\n\r\nBut every once in awhile, one of those skin collections gets to level up! We decide to reboot the line, or invest in world-building. For example, High Noon was reboot from a collection of joke cowboy skins into a demon-filled spooky Western. [Carnival Knights](https://twitter.com/notquitefrodo), our narrative writer, wrote out an entire narrative world for the Skins team to dive into and be inspired by. And based on reception, players appreciated that the skins had lore and depth.\r\n\r\nOkay, so now that I’m done explaining our philosophy around skin descriptions, I wanted to give you guys an update that we are going to slow down the pace in which we update these. Going forward, we will only be releasing descriptions for new skins. Old skins will get descriptions if they’re part of the same skin set AND it seems valuable for us to update that. This was a side project we were really passionate about, but we also want to make sure that Carnival Knights and other writers get the chance to write really awesome stories like [Trial of the Masks](https://universe.leagueoflegends.com/en_US/story/trial-of-the-masks/) and [The Man with the Grinning Shadow ](https://universe.leagueoflegends.com/en_US/story/the-man-with-the-grinning-shadow/) to continue to build on these skin lines so they can graduate from collection of skins, to something we want to invest in. \r\n\r\nHere to answer questions!","replies":[{"poster":"Garentheon","date":"2019-05-17T02:40:23.622+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Any plans for the academy to join battle academy?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Stellari","date":"2019-05-17T02:45:18.910+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"Academy is an example of a skin line that was made for purely cosmetic reasons. \n\nBattle Academia went through a thematic development stage of several months where we decided what the look/feel/sound was, who the students are, the weapons, the world, etc.\n\nThere's a chance in the future that the Academy skinline could be reworked into Battle Academia.
