Imagine if instead of armor or magic resist items just had adaptive defense and when you buy them you get to choose whether it turns into armor or mr? then like once you choose you have to sell the item and re-buy it if you wanna change which stat it has. I'd love to see a knight's vow but with magic resist, but I don't think we're gonna get it. Riot always says they'd love to add more choices for players but they don't want to overload the shop and make things confusing for new players. I think this would be kinda cool. Of course it would work the same way adaptive force does, armor and magic resist would each have their own respective values, they wouldn't be worth the same amount of adaptive defense. I'm pretty sure armor is worth a bit more gold than magic resist is (1 armor = 20 gold, 1 magic resist = 18 gold) so maybe adaptive defense would be worth more magic resist than armor? Kinda like how adaptive force is worth more ability power?","replies":[{"poster":"Pika Fox","date":"2020-01-29T08:21:52.730+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Adaptive defense already exists; its called health.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Smyrage","date":"2020-01-29T13:56:04.055+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I could only imagine adaptive defense as a form of adaptive shield, like the one Camille has.","replies":[]},{"poster":"WoonStruck","date":"2020-01-29T10:41:40.289+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Adaptive defense would either be win-more in the form most people would imagine it, or buff your LOWER resistance by a specified amount to create the most balanced experience. \n\nHowever, this would lead to champions having significant MR when purchasing primarily armor, or visa versa, and likely COULD NOT end up balanced without feeling insignificant.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Posui Gart","date":"2020-01-29T10:32:22.174+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1) Thats not how adaptive stats work. Right now it adds to either AD or AP, depending on how much AD/AP you have. There is no choice here, its more of a removal of useless choices. \n2) This only works with runes, not items\n3) Unlike offensive stats, that usually scale off themselves so you want to maximize one, you usually need both types of armor. So making it adaptive won't help much","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hazardus ducees","date":"2020-01-29T09:05:03.681+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well lets be honest and fair, adaptive resistance wouldn't exactly scale well, would gradually suck more early game and eventually suck later game. On top of that we have runes like Conditioning and 2 +6 flex armor runes. Even if we were to make \"adaptive defence\", we would still end up buffing a couple of really strong champions like Rammus and Ornn who already do really well with it within their kids. While I do agree that there needs to be some type of flexibility to one's choices- like having harder earlier or later game stats, this wouldn't exactly \"fit\" in with the rest of the choices out there.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2020-01-29T08:05:02.205+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The purpose of adaptive force is to allow generic buffs (like runes) to provide a champion's main stat. A Lux building a bunch of AP items isn't suddenly going to build doubleswords to counter the enemies' MR with mixed damage. Defensively, however, it makes perfect sense for someone to build both armor and MR to deal with both physical and magical incoming damage. Adaptive force doesn't allow players to customize items. An MR version of Knight's Vow would be more like asking for an AD Zhonya's.\n\nAnd there already is a stat that increases EH against most damage sources of any type: health. Which Knight's Vow already has.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ashe mage AD","date":"2020-01-29T07:37:37.179+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's a DotA thing kek.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MetaGeek","date":"2020-01-29T07:32:05.274+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nice idea but the adaptive force is only in runes i think, to my knowledge adaptive force never comes from items you just buy items for AP or AD you can't buy nashors tooth and get ad it's an AP item\nYou can't buy a blood thirster that heals you on magic damge.... \n\nSo I'm just confused as to why you want to apply adaptive defence to items when adaptive force is a runes thing not sure how that works exactly either but you get my point","replies":[]}]}
