Im currently using windows 10 and literally tried 5 o 6 drivers from nvidia and nothing works. The problem is, it always stays at 60 fps at the start of every game and if the match is really hard my  fps tends to drop to 4-6 fps and its unplayable anymore. I dont know what else to do to solve this problem. Note apart, my nvidia optimizes well all my other games, the problems only for LoL","replies":[{"poster":"DarkRitual","date":"2016-09-08T17:19:07.731+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Disabling the XBox Game Bar has worked for most people I try to help with this.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-08T15:31:55.167+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's a lot of different drivers you're trying out there, and I hope it hasn't caused too many issues to your files.
