Habitual terrible players are toxic as well but if RIOT wasn't lazy they would come up with a solution to hold those people accountable as well. Most of the chat toxicity in this game comes from all the other toxic things that go unchecked and that is 100% RIOT's fault. They don't hold people responsible for all their actions for the most part and only hold those accountable who call those people out in chat.\n\nLPQ is a joke. People play on toasters and WiFi or just leave.\n\nTrolls are free to roam.\n\nGriefers, grief at will.\n\nBad players never improve because they don't have a good reason to or can't get it through their thick skulls that they just can't play this game. So they keep trying and keep ruining the experience for others.\n\nAll these things contribute to chat toxicity yet are punished less frequently and less harshly.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Amor Omnia ","date":"2019-05-08T00:33:04.405+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"i definately agree. noobs should be quarantined","replies":[]},{"poster":"rabirinsu","date":"2019-05-07T20:38:57.448+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wonder if those newly hired Diversity Officer will help keep new players stay lol","replies":[]},{"poster":"Padoµch","date":"2019-05-07T07:42:14.298+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":3,"body":"Good, we are helping people not sink into the hellhole this game become...
