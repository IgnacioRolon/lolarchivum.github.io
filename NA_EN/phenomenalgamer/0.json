With every patch, there may be things added that provide additional resource drain on your computer.  We strive to keep the game playable for even low-end machines, but it is possible you may hit a point where you simply need to upgrade to run the game at a consistent FPS level.  \n\nIn the meantime however, I strongly recommend completing the steps in our[ FPS Troubleshooting Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684).  The steps there are some of the most common solutions to make sure that your FPS is as high and stable as possible.\n\nFeel free to give me a heads up if you're still experiencing any issues!","replies":[]}]}
