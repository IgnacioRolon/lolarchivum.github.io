Like, shouldnt I be paired with at least some silvers? That would  be more fair toward me.

It might be because you're playing normals and not ranked maybe? Maybe your MMR is actually high enough to be matched with Gold Players in ranked after all.\n\nHit me up with the account you're referencing and I'm more than happy to look over your recent matches.","replies":[{"poster":"sparpo","date":"2017-10-28T16:14:14.427+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh this is the NA forums xD, sorry bout that. The account im talking about is on EUW and its the same name : sparpo. (also i just hit gold 5, so its not silver 1 anymore. But still, when i was silver 1,  almost all of my opponents and allies were of higher elo)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Boxleitner","date":"2017-10-26T01:37:49.582+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Here's more proof of unfair Matchmaking:\n\nThe below match is a Treeline Promo match for Silver 4 placement. \n\nAs you can see, Despite my being Gold 5 and grouped with a Gold 5 and a Silver 2, I am facing three Plat 5 players.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/f5mzM\n","replies":[]}]}
