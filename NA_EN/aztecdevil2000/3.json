This had not been a problem till ping started rising for no reasons what so ever as everything on my end was perfectly fine. A constant set of pings to the league server itself was returning 500+ but that wasn't showing in game. Pinging any other site however tended to set me a nice 75 or lower, upon further investigation i can conclude that packet loss was not an issue and would thus like to ask riot why their servers have been literally dying. I would assume that if I was having insanely high ping via a ping to the actual game servers the game would tell me, but it does not. Riot if you are having issues paying for a good server then perhaps it would do well to charge more so that we may empty our wallets and be provided with a game worthy of all the money we, the player base, have dropped into it. No offence to you employees of the company, but as the game is now it seems hardly to have been worth the amount of money that has been dropped into your game. So riot please without any offence to any of you great people, before you begin trying to change champions and spice up the game with new weekly game modes, fix your servers so that we may enjoy said game modes and champions to their greatest degree. \r\n-With all respect that you people deserve\r\n                          aztecdevil2000","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-07T16:21:59.699+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your network is having trouble keeping a connection in-game, and might be suffering from packet loss.
