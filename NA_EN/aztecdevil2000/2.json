Since yesterday with patch 6.16 it's come to my attention that 30 minutes into a game my fps starts tanking for no reason whatsoever. I can have nothing running and yet my fps still tanks like a beast, thus I've come to ask if anyone else has been having these problems since the newest patch.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-19T16:20:38.342+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Frame drops could be due to outdated drivers, bad game files, or something else.

Apps like play.tv or overwolf have been causing issues for some players, so I would disable those as a first step.
