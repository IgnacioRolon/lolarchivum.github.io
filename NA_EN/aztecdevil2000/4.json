The system was designed this way to prevent any sort of abuse of the system.\n\nBad games happen, and when situations like yours happen, the best move is to simply report them for leaving the game or throwing and move on. I'm confident that if you keep grinding at it, you'll hit your goals for the season.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Horse Grenades","date":"2016-11-01T14:11:42.146+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"All you have to do now.
