You should probably try Riot's Connection KB and see if that helps with the ping spike. \n\nConnection KB: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues\n\nYou guys/gals with the same problem should try it as well. Hope you guys get back in the game soon! \n\n{{champion:25}} {{summoner:4}} {{item:3157}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Neodelux","date":"2015-11-04T23:37:52.773+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"same here.","replies":[]},{"poster":"WeGetItBro","date":"2015-11-04T04:38:57.741+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kind of the same thing here in Seattle, but mine is rarely up at 500+ but A;WAYS at 105-107.
