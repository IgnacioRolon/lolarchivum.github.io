Are they techo-crazy, like Heimerdinger and others; or are they rural, like Teemo; or fantasy, like Veigar and Lulu? Of course there's contrasts between champions (yordle champions seem to be more different than most), but how does the race in general do things? Are they unified or are there several different groups of them?\nOther factions, like hextechy Piltover, has a consistent theme; what is Bandle City's consistent theme?\nOld lore has rural elements, like the new shopkeeper.

I know that this is a mistake that most fantasy/sci fi writers make, but I hate when they write off entire races as monolithic entities that act in a certain way. Why do all dwarves carry around axes and drink a lot? Why are all elves in love with nature? Sure, culture means that their society can influence and approve of them acting in stereotypical ways, but it's really annoying to see that sort of thing.

I love Bandle City and the Mothership. People may fall into categories but the variation is profound. Albert Einstein, Evil Knievil, and that fat mean chick at Wal-Mart who isn't shopping are ALL people. I don't see any reason Yordles should all be the same either. Plus their constant pursuit of \"Getting the mothership repaired/operational/upgraded\" explains a lot of their motivations.\n\nTeemo: Scouting for raw materials, threats to the mothership. Also explains his sometimes mentioned mental instability as he is always alone and under great pressure. In addition he experiments with many poisons to attack his enemies with, and he needs to test them on something...\n\nTristana: Her cannon probably CAME from the mothership. She was likely an engineer who became distracted playing with it when she should have been putting it back on the ship after fixing it, and found out she had an in-born talent for ranged combat. A necessary skill when defending Bandle City from THE F'ING VOID AND SHADOW ISLES, not to mention Noxus!\n\nVeigar: People go insane, why not Yordles? Maybe Veigar's job on the Mothership was to find out how to use magic to aid in its repair/upgrading. As Veigar delved deeper into something that isn't natural to Yordles his mind slowly cracked (You look into the Void, the Void looks back at you!), and it wasn't long before he was using other Yordles for his magic. This would EASILY explain why Yordles shy away from magic, Veigar would have convinced them it was unsafe for them to be messing with it!  Lulu is a loner and wouldn't have been exposed to Veigar's insanity, plus she's a little off herself.\n\nRumble: Simply the jealous type! Seeing Tristana every day while they worked on the Mothership together he just had to find a way to impress her. He didn't know how to do much, just what little he learned tinkering on the Mothership and what little he could understand of Heimerdinger's intense ravings about technology. He grabbed what little he could afford, he didn't have much left after caring for his dying mother/fixing up his storm-torn home/buying up enough tech for his cockpit/buying gifts for Tristana. Being that he isn't really brilliant, he used up his budget before he got to the legs and couldn't think of a cheap way to give his robot good traction until EUREKA! The plunger legs were born!\n\nLulu: Lulu was abandoned by bad parents. They left her in the forest to die, they were unable to bring themselves to care for a child and no other Yordle knew about her. Lulu was taken in by the magic of the forest (literally), and was raised by spirits and mythological forest beasts (possible tie-in to new Jax lore here!). She learned magic the way she learned everything else, it was a part of her constant daily reality. Other Yordles have no idea how to deal with her, she doesn't retain any part of their culture.\n\nHeimerdinger: Heimerdinger is the Yordles premier mind. The Einstein or Stephen Hawking of his generation. Heimer quickly understood everything about the Mothership, including how it had nothing to do with the Yordles current predicaments. He tried to explain this to his fellow Yordles but like many geniuses Heimerdinger is misunderstood. He cannot fathom how to talk to people who aren't as smart as he is, and he quickly became unpopular with the other Yordles. Shunned and greatly disliked, Heimer left Bandle City to pursue the honing of his great mind in places where it would be appreciated.\n\nI don't find it difficult to explain the Yordles or give them depth in the light of the Mothership, I really don't understand why Riot does. I'm stopping my list here because it's late and I'm tired. I'll do more if anybody wants.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TerraRising","date":"2014-10-27T22:24:54.354+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"> What I *can* say is that Yordles, as they have always been, are a eclectic bunch that excel at pretty much anything they set their minds to.

Whatever. They appear to have committed to spending the next several years destroying everything and laying new \"foundations\" for a League-less League of Legends (or \"Runeterran\") universe.

I don't mind contrained writing: I enjoy the challenge of coming up with creative ways to wrap Factions lore around whatever new wrenches they throw into the works. Nonetheless, given their new \"foundations\" campaign, I'm going to start running up against the limits of my ability (or at least my desire) to be flexible.\n\nFor example, if they come through and declare that Bandle City is a goofy suburb of Piltover, or erase the weirder aspects of yordles (like their cultishness or their *intense* community ties) to make them generic fuzzballs, I'll probably have to just make that a point of divergence between the Factions universe and the Narrative universe.\n\nThey aren't losing any sleep over kicking us all out of Runeterra, or demolishing years of community lore to avoid hypothetical future \"constraints\", or severing their new lore's ties to the game itself in pursuit of some ambition to create a multimedia franchise.

She has her own perceptions of good an evil, no matter what others say otherwise.\n\nRito never mentioned she was \"good\" either, she's just \"not evil\", that's why she's \"neutral\". She is \"chaotic\" as her fairy magic goes to.... *places*. And out of the ordinary according to most people on Runeterra. Come on, it's already strange enough to turn a GIANT monster into a harmless-looking critter!

Thank you for being a writer of nearly every thing that my University group of League of Legends (aprox. 14 summoners) think about this great and flawed Recton. We have weekly meetings and today we were really considering how could the Lore fanbase deal with the bulldozing of the Institute of War, what defined us being what we were and how we presented the game to each new member. While we still are having headaches about to introduce new players to the game (and story matters a lot for our foundational members) we were considering about parting ways with this awful proposal of the New Narrative Team and move on over fanfictions about the Original True Lore. And, man, **I do hate fanfictions**.
