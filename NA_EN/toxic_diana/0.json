And she does it even without hitting it. After lvl 6 she is very braindead just like an Akali. You don't feel outplayed at all when a Diana kills you, she just kills you with sheer overwhelming force.\nAlso for a \"Diver\" she is very mobile and bursty but doesn't really build any sustain yet survives longer than others with her amount of mobility.","replies":[{"poster":"Toxic Diana","date":"2018-04-30T11:23:46.191+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"But she doesn't have mobility. She has a gap closer, yes, but what good is that when she hits level 18 and the enemy team can hard cc her and shut her down? At least akali has her W which can help her escape once she's in. Diana's combo is braindead, but if the enemy team have half a bronze brain, they'll make it super hard for you to even dive in without getting murdered. THAT'S why Diana sucks. \n\nShe needs a rework. Either turn her into a true Fighter and give her more sustain (like xin), OR turn her into an assassin and give her an escape. It isn't FUN for people playing against a Diana to get one-shot helplessly, and it isn't fair for Diana players to have to play a champion who is used as an assassin, but has a kit like a Fighter. \n\nDiana's kit is like building full Lethality on Xin. You will be able to oneshot anyone without giving them counterplay, but what use is that when you have little sustain and 0 escape?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ionshatter","date":"2019-04-17T10:27:38.521+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"*Misses her Q, R+AA once at 6 and you instantly die* \n\"I hAvE To LAnD my Q!!!\"\n*Rs from bush point blank fires Q still gets ult reset*\n\"I hAvE To LAnD my Q!!!\"\n*Runs out of mana at 6 and AAs a fucking 2/0 Jax with ult to death with part of nashors*\n\"I hAvE To LAnD my Q!!!\"\n*Has a colossal pull disrupt akin to Orianna ult as a basic ability that you cannot miss without brain damage*\n\"AsAsaiNs CanT tEamfiGht!!!\"\n*Gets a massive spammable shield for building damage that also does damage*\n\"DiAnA iS SquIshY!!!\"\n*Can chain ult resets and abilities over and over and over to slaughter everyone*\n\"ShE cAn OnLy 1 Shot OnCe!!!\"\n*With 1 item and part of ludens can 1 shot any adc with a full maw and tenacity boots due to sustain tank burst*\n\"DIaNa is FaIr aNd BaLaNcED REEeEE\"\n\nYou people are so biased it's disgusting.
