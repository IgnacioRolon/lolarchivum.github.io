Now, the issue I keep having is that when I notice I've been staring at the same not-fully-loaded loading screen for at least 5 minutes, only to tab out to check my internet and find that I lost connection during loading, told by a notification window that decided not to pop up in front of the game.  It's incredibly frustrating for me to realize I've wasted precious time that I could have used to try to reconnect before they remake the game, and only to find that it was remade while I wasn't even aware of being disconnected.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-08-15T17:56:20.657+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This does sound stressful, and we'd like to help.  Thees blips could be packet loss or some kind of instability struggling to get you in.  To start, I highly recommend going over each step of the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to get back in.
