You will find some interesting things. I found that leblanc stays in her dashing animation. Its nothing game changing its just fun to see. Figured i would share.","replies":[{"poster":"Yormaughm","date":"2015-01-07T00:20:49.594+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This happened once when I was Poro-Rider Sejuani and Kalista used her binding on me, I was clicking the map repeatedly and when I went into the death animation I stayed in it cause it happened at about the same time the \"ring\" thing goes away. So for about 10 seconds I was a giant dead poro sliding across the map. It was pretty hilarious.\n\nI asked the people on my team if they could see it but they said they couldn't though.","replies":[{"poster":"0AppleJuice0","date":"2015-01-07T05:22:07.586+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lmfao, yeah it just depends on when u do it and if they really pay attention. I got stuck in the lee jump animation until i reused my W.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"0AppleJuice0","date":"2015-01-06T21:12:15.478+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah so it works with lee when you jump to an outside ward lol. Shen just gets blocked by the wall but it works for a few seconds he stays in his dash animation until the wall disappears. So i assume that almost every champ that can leap will have this freeze in their dash animation.","replies":[]},{"poster":"0AppleJuice0","date":"2015-01-06T20:40:54.167+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know it works for vayne if u tumble right before it goes away.
