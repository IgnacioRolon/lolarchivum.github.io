Per our [hextech crafting](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207884233-Hextech-Crafting-Guide), you will earn more at first and the chances will slowly decrease until it resets in roughly 30 days.  Once the reset occurs, you'll find yourself earning more fragments at a quicker rate- rinse and repeat.  Keys chests are also available for purchase through the in-game store.  Best of luck!","replies":[{"poster":"labiad","date":"2016-10-07T18:40:11.954+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ok thank you i well try to get them from store","replies":[]}]}]}
