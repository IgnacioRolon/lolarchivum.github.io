It happens about once every ten second, where all particles fail to load, no new models can enter or leave the visible area (Enter: Champions currently not in your sight aren't visible even if they enter your vision until the freeze ends, no new minions are able to be seen or targeted. Leave: minions don't die, their health just disappears, champions still visible where they exited the fog of war) As you can tell, this MASSIVELY impacts my enjoyment of the game. I need some help.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-17T22:40:22.180+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeeeaaaa it sounds like your network is having some pretty hefty issues with packet loss if all of that is happening constantly. Basically, parts of the data your connection is sending is getting corrupted. Without all of that data some pretty weird things like minions not appearing properly, or health bars not showing up correctly can happen. \n\nHit up our [**log reader**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743) and let it scan some recent network logs from a game that had these issues, and post a screenshot of that here for me to go over with you.","replies":[]}]}
