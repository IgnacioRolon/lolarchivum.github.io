I would like to know if its the case of punishment for not accepting too many games, and if it is, how long wil it stay like that?\r\nAlso, why  i  can play tutorial and custom, but not bots?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-21T02:13:54.666+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm..
