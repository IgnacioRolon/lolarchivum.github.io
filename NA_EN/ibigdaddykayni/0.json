Sorry for the late reply, as you can tell it's been a busy few days 'round these boards xD.

When every champ you own doesn't have any 975 or lower skin available to them, it's random.","replies":[{"poster":"IBigDaddyKaynI","date":"2017-08-13T08:33:45.167+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i thought jhins high noon was 975 lmao","replies":[{"poster":"Kokua","date":"2017-08-13T08:35:36.847+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=IBigDaddyKaynI,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=0HBqRf6K,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2017-08-13T08:33:45.167+0000)\n>\n> i thought jhins high noon was 975 lmao\n\nWhen I looked at a site, it showed it being 1350. If it comes up 975 in the store in the client (I can't see, as I already own it), you may be able to argue the case and ask for them to change it.","replies":[{"poster":"IBigDaddyKaynI","date":"2017-08-13T08:38:38.623+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"nah you answered my question i don't need to cry about it more i made a mix-up so its fine lol","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
