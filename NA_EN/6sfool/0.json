I don't surrender unless it's a complete stomp, and I will 1v5 at my nexus if I have to.  I pointed out that my past 20 games are stomps because statistically that means something.  One team gets ahead and then their win is often inevitable, whether it's me, my team, or the enemy team.  This is mostly a laning problem.  When I jungle I can always keep out of the team kda and don't have to worry to much about farming, but when I'm in a stat stick lane like jugg v jugg top, crit-based adc matchups, or heavy poke lanes there's no avoiding it.  If the enemy gets even 1 kill, they can use that lead to bully low-range enemies into never farming again.  Snowballing through stat-checking is insane right now.  The only way to stop a snowballer is through well-coordinated ganks and perfect knowledge of their weaknesses, which you can't really expect when you let them get ahead in the first place.\n\nMy point is, it's too easy to keep a lead.  When I'm fed I play reckless as hell, 1v3ing, taking drag while the entire enemy team is nearby, and usually it works out because in solo queue they can't expect to organize against you.  This might be a matchmaking issue, or it could be that I tilt more than I think I do, or play poorly from behind, but 20 games in a row of continual stomps (often with me not even in the mix) shows that something is wrong.","replies":[{"poster":"macromite","date":"2017-03-18T14:47:40.029+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"perhaps its just a matter of shifting focus. maybe the way that you play is more prone to stomping and being stomped, a high risk high reward playstyle.\n\nWhen what you want is a low risk playstyle.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Snowplosion","date":"2017-03-18T19:17:08.513+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please do not say all of you're last twenty games were stomps when around half of them were over thirty two minutes...","replies":[{"poster":"6Sfool","date":"2017-03-19T01:37:10.588+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"32 minutes is a stomp when the only reason is the losing team is full of optimists who won't surrender.
