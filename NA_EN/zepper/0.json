As for mages, Athene's and Zhonya's are sort of defensive AP items available to mages because mages aren't marksmen: their damage is limited to cooldowns and they lack sustained damage, hence why they have no real way of dealing with tanks.\n\nWhile many mages are vulnerable to assassins if building full glass cannon, they have options like Rod of Ages and Rylai's and/or Liandry's (which give health in addition to AP and other nifty things) on top of Zhonya's and Athene's that give them means of reacting to an assassin, AP or AD.

Realistically, WotA is extremely Niche (coughVladcough) and both Nashor's and Lichbane or pretty niche themselves and not viable items on most mages. Your average mage has almost no options to viably opt into CDR during a game.\n\nAny ADC that wants 40% CDR can get it from just items. Any tank that wants 40% CDR can get it from just items. Any support that wants 40% CDR can get it from just items. Any mage that wants 40% CDR probably has to take 10% CDR in runes. I thought Riot really like items and item build paths being flexible for ever game, but mages can never go \"Wow, I really want/need to get CDR this game, I guess I'll buy <insert-CDR-item-here>\" but instead have to decide before the game starts if they want/need CDR in order to realistically reach the cap and that's their only choice. There's no flexibility in CDR for mages.\n\nI know Riot has said they don't want mages to be able to get CDR so easily because they utilize it better than other classes, but I feel like being unable to get it wrong. Are mages \"too strong\" with CDR? Fine, then let them make the choice: CDR or actual damage. Give them a CDR item that they buy only for the CDR and let the other stats (AP/mana/mpen/HP/something) just be there to round it out. Hell, make it not-cost efficient on stats alone, but let the mages have a choice or option to get CDR if they really think that is the best path.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"warpenguin555","date":"2016-03-30T13:02:02.042+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=LVVfpE7f,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2016-03-30T03:18:04.016+0000)\n>\n> Yes.

Void Staff already scales so that it's far less effective against a target with minimal MR compared to a tank with a lot of MR.
