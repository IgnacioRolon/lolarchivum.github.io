I'm relatively still new but since im a one trick i decided that i'd be more important to put my IP to runes over champions. so basically all i wanna know is if those 3 months of me grinding were wasted and if i really wont be getting back my 30k from runes, also spent about 20k on rune pages too (3 pages) and i see that those are also going to be pretty useless next season as well... either way, are we really not getting a refund or anything back if we bought runes before May/June? If so i mean its alittle dumb, if possible it'd be nice if everyone, at least the people who bought runes this season would get a 100% refund instead of the people who bought them after the change was announced.\r\n\r\nP.S. I'm posting this in \"Help &amp; Support\" because apparently my level 30 account isn't level 7 so i can't post in gameplay.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading, Sinn &lt;3","replies":[{"poster":"Firethorn","date":"2017-09-01T18:39:27.518+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They just released a video on this topic!

We don't have any additional information or updates than that currently.  Rune Pages will also still carry over to when the new system rolls out, and will still be usable.  Your profile should be sync'd now, if you'd like to share any feedback with the devs and community over at the [gameplay boards](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance).
