When I play LoL I would get sudden rise of ping and thus disconnecting me from game, my internet crashes and my Lap top freezes. Note: I have never had this problem before, if anyone had this kind of problem, let me know if there's a solution. Also, my Lap top never does this, only when I play LoL. So, I am a bit confused.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-21T17:12:50.301+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your network is having an issue maintaining a connection to the server, which will result in put delays or lag spikes.
