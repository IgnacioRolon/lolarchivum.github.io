I lost lp and most likely got reported countless times. Thus, if anyone has had this issue before please respond. :)","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-08-02T16:57:50.526+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That sounds awful, and I'd like to help but need some more info.  When you say return to desktop do you mean it tasks out or it closes completely?  Are you getting any error messages?","replies":[{"poster":"DeviliciousDog","date":"2017-08-02T19:17:23.322+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It doesn't close completely, it's running but it won't open loading champion screen. As matter of fact, when I click on it, it shows me blank page and cursor and closes :/ It has done it numerous times as I stated. And I'm not receiving any error messages. I have disabled some of the startup programs so maybe that will help. It didn't return me to desktop when I played last game, so hopefully it won't be doing that anymore :)","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-08-02T20:18:22.379+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the extra info!  It sounds like your game is going into a dormant state, which happens if your connection is failing to reach the game server.  Try out each step in the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to fix this up, and test it out in a custom game.  I hope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"DeviliciousDog","date":"2017-08-03T14:20:08.213+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for the guideline. I tried disabling some startup programs and some services that were eating up my memory and it worked. It no longer kicks me out ^^","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
