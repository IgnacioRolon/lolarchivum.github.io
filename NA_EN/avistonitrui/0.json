I can log into the client and get into champ select just fine, but when the loading screen for the game should pop up, I end up with a black screen and my cursor a loading symbol until I eventually get an error saying, \"Unable to connect to the server.\" and the option to retry or cancel.\r\n\r\nI have tried everything I can think of to get this issue resolved.  Disabled my firewall, used player support, ran through the entire network issues section step by step, doing everything I could do.  Occasionally the problem would fix itself for a little bit, but it would eventually come back unexpectedly and give me leaver-buster because of it.\r\n\r\nI now turn to the community at large to help me out.  If anyone needs more specifics, please say so so I may provide them. I truly want to keep playing league, but I won't be able to if this problem persists.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-02T21:39:20.818+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yea it sounds like your network is either having problems getting connected to very specific game servers, or something in your client files is damaged and only causes issues every once and awhile. I know you mentioned going through the [**network settings**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide, but let's just make sure to cover all our bases by going through the steps again. After that, double check your drivers and check out the steps in our [**FPS guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting) as well.","replies":[{"poster":"AvisTonitrui","date":"2017-07-02T21:55:11.081+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tried and once again I still cannot connect to the servers.","replies":[]}]}]}
