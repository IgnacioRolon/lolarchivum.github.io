But how do you have fun when every game you&#039;re constantly camped by anywhere from 2-3 people? Where&#039;s the enjoyment in that? Especially when the whole enemy team sits there insulting you non-stop. \r\n\r\nI did nothing to deserve this either. I rarely speak in-game, I don&#039;t insult or taunt people, I&#039;m not fantastic at the game enough to be considered a must camp threat. I don&#039;t whine, blame my team mates or any of that other stuff that might make people think I&#039;m some sort of weak link they should camp. \r\n\r\nSo tell me, how do you enjoy yourself when your games are like this?","replies":[{"poster":"woodvsmurph","date":"2018-11-05T23:31:01.450+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You either have a team that punishes that by A. destroying the enemy on the rest of the map harder than you are getting punished by being camped or B. counter-ganks for you and let's the best laner win.\n\nIf you get either of these, you revel in the fact that your opponents are so cowardly that they must bring multiple people just to deal with you and they are still going to get smashed.

If my team destroys them elsewhere on the map I'm still going to be miserable sticking it out. And sure, sometimes you do get ganks, but a lot of them are poorly thought out, and the successful ones don't last.\n\nYou are right that it's better than the alternative though.","replies":[{"poster":"woodvsmurph","date":"2018-11-06T18:07:56.495+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I personally take pride in pulling the attention of several enemies and letting my team win out 4v3 or 4v2 or something like that while I just absorb pressure. You need to really know your champ, know itemization, and recognize your limits. But if you learn that and your team actually does their job elsewhere, then it's really rewarding. I can recall more than one game where I did this, reached a point where I just knew... well I can 1v2 anyone on their team now, and started destroying them for camping me. More than once this let me help my team get baron and then splitpush - pull 4 enemies to stop me splitting, and let my team 4v1 wreck the 5th enemy and end the game. All the while I'm just 1v4 taunting the enemy team so they don't know if they should back and save the base or chase me. And if they do commit to basing, I'll turn around and 1v4 dive them to stop their backs and take several of them out. Literally one of the best feelings in the game to me.\n\nAnd yeah... I know unfortunately most games don't go like that. Trust me... I know. The most generic toplane experience? You get counterpicked, 2v1 camped, go even or possibly win lane regardless, build to be able to duel your 2 \"lane\" opponents, and get flamed by team for your \"bad\" itemization and not helping them... as they all feed, refuse to ever help you, and manage to not hold a single tower even if they're 4v3. And if you do 5v5? They screw you over and flame you for \"bad engage\" and \"feeding\". Then wonder why you don't help them more. That's why you have to treasure the victories all the more.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"CauseSCIENCE","date":"2018-11-05T22:09:25.166+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Play Swain and 1v2 with his ultimate","replies":[]},{"poster":"LeftyRaydy","date":"2018-11-06T18:43:25.671+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if you are outplaying the camping then do a little smack talking.
