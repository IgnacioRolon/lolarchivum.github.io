I'm mostly an aram player but I feel like the game is so snowbally. I think it has to do with the towers being ridiculously weak. There's a good amount of fighting for the first tower. But after that, the second tower, inhibitor and nexus towers usually fall in one swoop. It shouldn't be that way.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Total Atrophy","date":"2018-02-13T18:04:43.279+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a proud TWISTED TREELINE MAIN I agree xD.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Firefox509","date":"2018-02-13T19:01:06.292+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":2,"body":"Both.

But there's alot of things you cannot effectively play, because when you make your masteries so impactful on the game, you either have to make good masteries to synergize with EVERY SINGLE CHAMP, or the ones that the masteries synergize with the best will be stronger, period.

Also the same people who complain that towers are too weak and 3 or 4 man dives are ruining the game also complain about stop watch, which is rich considering stopwatch is about your best hope at beating/surviving a 3 man tower dive. Not Id actually be okay with a tower buff but honestly I dont think it is that bad. Also I think mobility is high, but not really a bad thing. People just like high mobility because it FEELS good and is flashy.
