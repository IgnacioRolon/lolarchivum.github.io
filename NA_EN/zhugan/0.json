I bring this up for a few reasons.\r\n\r\n1. If people are buying tickets to games, this potential inaccuracy could create a situation in which people buy tickets to the wrong day and wind up watching a game that isn&#039;t the game that they want to watch.\r\n\r\n2. If it is a mistake, it needs fixed.\r\n\r\n3. If its not a mistake, honestly, they need to address that because for pretty much every split before now the first place team got to play on Sunday which actually conveys some pretty significant potential advantages. Changing that without some kind of statement seems odd to me.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Commish","date":"2018-03-20T16:26:36.816+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi! \nThe question here is whether the 1st place team should have one more day to prepare for  the lowest seed, or one more day to prepare for the day in Miami.

At least then I'll be happily surprised when someone shows some instead of disappointed that it seems to be perennially absent.\n\nRiot is a major corporation that runs a professional sport. **ACT LIKE IT.**","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zhugan","date":"2018-03-21T17:39:16.475+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"23 hours and counting and it is STILL WRONG.

I can't imagine literally any other professional sport where this sort of error would be maintained for this length of time; especially if it has any impact AT ALL on the days that the teams are playing because that has a direct impact on people who purchased tickets thinking they would see one team and wind up seeing another.\n\nIts even more unacceptable when I know that there was a Reddit thread posted on Monday morning that reached frontpage of r/LoL, that multiple tweets have been sent to @lolesports about this issue, and that Nadeshot has commented on it as well.\n\nIt makes me wonder if Echo Fox is favored over 100 Thieves behind the scenes for some reason or another (perhaps because Rick Fox was the only owner who didn't come out in favor of franchising when the rest of the owners did?); which is not something that Riot really wants people to be wondering about.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Lady FrostIron","date":"2018-03-20T15:15:04.542+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Someone at Riot is super salty that 100 Thieves won 1st seed and not Echo Fox.{{sticker:sg-lux-2}}","replies":[{"poster":"Zhugan","date":"2018-03-20T16:00:30.939+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Right?
