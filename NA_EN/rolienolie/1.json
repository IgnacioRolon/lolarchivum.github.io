I am wondering if this was changed for a reason or if it is a bug. It is definitely not a client side error as I have asked multiple people and all of them are experiencing the same issue. \r\n\r\nHere is a screenshot of what I am on about. (sorry, imgur is the only thing i knew how to use. I am dumb.)\r\nhttp://imgur.com/uDRnLvv\r\n\r\nAny sort of reply would be greatly appreciated :)","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-10-13T19:51:52.139+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey Rolienolie,\n\nThanks for the report!
