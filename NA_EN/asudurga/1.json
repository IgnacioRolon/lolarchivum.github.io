But I'll need just a bit more information about the problem first.  What does bugging out mean exactly?  Does it error out?  Does it disconnect?

Oh yes, and constant unknown error reports, so many unknown error reports.","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-06-15T23:39:42.276+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Given the errors you are describing, they all seem to be some type of connection issue.  Our servers are trying to display information to the client but it is either getting very delayed, or the information straight up doesn't arrive, causing the unknown errors.  In an effort to fix this, make sure to complete all of the steps in our [Connection Issues Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues).  There are quite a few steps there, but they are crucial in hopefully resolving this issue.\n\nFeel free to give me a reply if you still don't see any improvement!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MrMike4","date":"2016-06-15T14:27:02.439+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also the infamous black screen after champ select, any news on this?","replies":[]}]}]}
