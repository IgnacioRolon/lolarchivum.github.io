A huge majority of the playerbase has this issue, and here's the thing; most have pretty high spec computers. No matter what I did, the issue was not resolved, so it has to be an issue either with your files or your servers, Riot.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-16T05:30:01.906+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I double-checked to ensure there aren't any recorded issues with the NA servers as of late.

Specifically Mac and Windows 10 users from how I've seen the boards. The rest of the computer works fine, just the LoL app which flat out freezes, as in graphically everything has frozen but the gameplay is still going on with sounds and everything.\n\nI've done some research into the lag spikes in-game and here is a list of causes I know:\n\n1. Backing to base and walking back to lane. Rapid freezes in succession, caused me to get killed by the jungler  I literally can't see coming, in both full screen and windowed.\n\n2. Hovering mouse over anything in the hud that causes info to pop up. Examples include; Level up arrows, ability icons, exp amount, clicking on the map and holding G to ping.\n\n3. General gameplay in both windowed and full screen, though to a lesser extent and still barely playable. \n\nIt may have been an issue with the patch update that could have caused some compatibility issues, I use a Macbook Pro with a \nIntel Iris 1536 MB for graphics and a 2.4 GHz Intel Core i5 Processor. Fairly old from late 2013 but holy damn is it a trooper able to handle Guns of Icarus and other graphically demanding games like Chivalry: Medieval Warfare. \n\nHowever, recent computers like my Toshiba Laptop have the exact same issues as my Mac, and that very same Laptop I was able to play Assassins Creed 3 since the Ubisoft Giveaway without any lag. I implore you, on behalf of the player-base to look further into this issue to find a fix as the game has become unplayable since the 7.1 Patch.\n\nThank you.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-16T22:06:42.978+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd like to ensure this isn't something resolvable with some targetted steps.
