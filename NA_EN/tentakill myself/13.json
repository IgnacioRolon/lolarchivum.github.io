LeBlanc doesn't assassinate people without her R unless she's something like 25-0; using her ult to clear a single wave means she can't assassinate someone for up to 40 seconds and also has one of her escapes burnt (most likely both, if she uses R to waveclear she'll have used her W as well), meaning she's easy picking for the enemy mid and is effectively useless for the better part of a minute. How losing all of that for the sake of clearing a wave quicker isn't a fair trade off is beyond me.\n\nLeBlanc has poor clear as it is and no matter how much people will have you believe she has immense waveclear, she really doesn't. She has one basic ability that can waveclear (which is also her main harass) and her ultimate for desperate situations. Someone who suggests reducing the damage her W/WR do to minions is suggesting she be completely unable to clear a wave. \n\nThere are frustrating aspects to LeBlanc's kit that if changed, might make her feel less bad to play against. Her waveclear however is not the right thing to target. You are making a champion that is arguably not overpowered (just annoying) weaker without actually making her feel at all better to play against, which is exactly what you don't want to do. You would complain about her again the second she became strong, because you took the lazy route (this is what will happen if Akali is ever powerful again, because her nerfs were lazy as hell and did nothing to give her more counterplay).","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"PP Naruto","date":"2015-04-22T14:21:24.126+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=DomainSpecific,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=F9xxQUMT,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-04-21T06:20:02.391+0000)\n>\n> I would rather she gets reduced dmg when Wing to minions. or maybe even making enhanced W not dealing any damage to minions. \n> \n> If her mobility is her defining feature, then she shouldn't be able to farm minions so easily.\n\nLOL......she sucks at cs'ing UNLESS you make the compromise to blow your mana on minions thus meaning you're restricting yourself from attacking opponent \"as much\"","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"The BÃ­g Ticket","date":"2015-04-21T13:31:24.372+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":3,"body":"She is fine...doesn't really need nerfs.
