Eve can sneak through words (like Rengo) but has to get around teams without being seen to reach her target, as she loses stealth if she even gets close to them.  Also, Rengo can literally 100-0 someone in .5 seconds when ahead by not that much gold against enemy squishies.  Eve can burst them down too, but not to that extent and she usually gets killed or severely injured getting the kill by the enemy team unless she can get a 1v1.  Rengo has the problem of enemy teams as well, but he can usually do fine in a 1v1 after bursting down an enemy, giving him effective 2v1 or even 3v1 potential.  Eve can only do such things if the enemies ignore her or are out of position and she can get a series of mini 1v1's off.  Her ult helps to live long enough to burst someone and deal some AOE in groups though, so she has a lot of potential in teamfights, but she's nowhere near as snowbally as Rengo, and she pays a lot more for her stealth than he does, having no sustain or gap closers and relying on her speedup to chase down enemies instead of straight ambushing them.
