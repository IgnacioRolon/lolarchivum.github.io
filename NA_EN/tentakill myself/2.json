Yes, every skin has at least some thought that goes into the story behind it - this helps by establishing creative limitations and giving the final design a coherent feel.\n\nWe also talk a lot about opposing skin lines (Commando/Crimson Elite, Warden/Marauder, Arcade/Boss etc.) that allow us to create some tension and action within an alternate world, so you're Elderwood/Rotwood idea is pretty on-point.\n\nOn the subject of Green and Nature-y  skins we catually try them from time to time, but green is a very hard colour to make work as a primary on Summoner's rift and making things leafy only worsens the situation! It can certainly be done, I think the TF Lore skin was the latest example, but yeah green skins are tricky.","replies":[{"poster":"SuperLuigiLXIV","date":"2015-10-31T15:39:28.470+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you guys do more Elderwood skins, what are the odds of seeing Elderwood Keeper Wukong? {{champion:62}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Niyumi","date":"2015-10-31T05:45:48.161+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you don't mind my asking, what's the story behind the Definitely Not line?

I work with writers, musicians and other artist on a daily basis. There's is an incredible pool of talent at Riot and it just keeps growing.\n\nDNBlitzcrank was a Halloween inspired skin, Blitzcrank dressing up as 'Person in disguise' as you might see at a Halloween party. Udyr getting the name 'Definitely Not' probably didn't have enough thought put into it, because he Definitely IS Udyr - not satisfied with one costume like Urf Nami, he brought a costume for each of his different aspects and switches them as required. It's a fun idea that had been a concept for a number of years at Riot, ever since Ironstylus came to work dressed as a parrot (which he actually did again yesterday for Halloween). Basically the Halloween and April Fool's skins were much like Pool Party but instead it's a dress up party (and Amumu is always forgotten).\n\nYou're right about the green, it's because it blends into the map a lot. That's really a red flag in our game because no matter what we are designing from particles to pick-ups, gameplay and thus clarity are paramount. No matter how cool it is, if it creates a frustrating play experience we need to find a different solution. Often we shift either hue, value or saturation to address this. So you could make it more yellow/blue, bright/dark or grey/neon to get away from the specific colour of SR. Although we need to playtest and run them around in the river and warmer/cooler parts of SR too. We solved Cutpurse TF by reducing the saturation and shifting the hue towards a blue-green. The hardest is if we want to do something like Maokai with rich green leaves and wood because that *should* be the same colours as SR and if we change it then it doesn't look like lush vegetation.","replies":[{"poster":"Niyumi","date":"2015-10-31T21:12:04.887+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just hope that dream comes true. ^^ I didn't know you were so new though -- congrats!\n\nHaha, he came in dressed like a parrot? xD All these video game companies sound so laid back and fun; Carbine has Nerf wars occasionally, and they troll each other in the office.

But working in games can be high pressure and stress too. You're working alongside amazing talent and everyone is pushing to improve and there's a lot to live up to. It's really satisfying work but expectations are high from players and colleagues. Have you ever heard of impostor syndrome?  It's totally real. One of Riot's core values is 'Take play seriously' and part of that is knowing that sometimes amidst the super serious meetings the best thing to do is dress like a parrot and play some arams.\n\nGreen as an accent colour is a great way to go!","replies":[{"poster":"Niyumi","date":"2015-11-01T01:21:46.272+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, kudos to you, Mr. Developer Person.

It does hurt to see people speculating about the \"LC$\", missing features and Riot's choices and being unable to give people a better view into Riot or any sort of information that wouldn't just cause further frustration.\n\nImpostor Syndrome is common enough that we have people give talks on how to cope with it, and it happens at any company that has a lot of world class talent. The people around me all have a reputation, have worked on other big games in the past or created their own games, have achieved so much already I try not to think about it too much. One of our principle artists has been working in animation since Anastasia, the other designed the characters of Team Fortress 2... one of the people I play Pathfinder with designed Stephen Hawking's computer and worked for NASA! It's crazy if I think about what the people I talk to have done. I think it's natural for humble people to feel this way, and it's humble people who are constantly working hard to improve. Arrogant people who take too much pride in their achievements tend to plateau, so you might consider it a blessing in disguise.\n\nYou're right though, while I never feel like my work is good enough it absolutely makes my day when I see a player using a skin I worked on and having fun. That's the best part of my job by far. So keep cooking food and making art, if only to see the smiles on the faces of the people you care about!\n\nThanks for chatting!","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Stars Shaper","date":"2015-10-31T13:54:57.787+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Too bad we already have both Marauder and Warden ADCs, I was hoping on Varus getting one (but he still might count as a Midlaner doesn't he? _wink wink_)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rhenoware","date":"2015-10-31T18:54:31.790+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Niyumi","date":"2015-10-31T21:00:43.105+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What in the world? xD What does that have to do with anything?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"TomeRiddle","date":"2015-11-01T18:48:15.359+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Kindlejack,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=Q8g0PchO,comment-id=000300010000,timestamp=2015-10-31T04:23:54.445+0000)\n>\n> Yeah well when we made Elderwood Bard we definitely had a small amount of story driving the design and I'm always thinking about how to expand skin lines.

Blood moon is admittedly a bit of a catch-all for Japanese aesthetics but there is some thought behind each one. The original skins were part of an Ionian performance during the Blood Moon, Thresh, Kalista and Elise were how those champions might manifest in Ionian legends and Zilean is the leader of a cult that performs evil rituals on the Blood Moon.\n\nSomething like Project is more cohesive and specific (which is largely due to the skins being developed all together) but it really depends what direction would better serve the skin.","replies":[{"poster":"PapaGreg21","date":"2015-10-31T16:43:15.165+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Kindlejack,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=Q8g0PchO,comment-id=000300040000,timestamp=2015-10-31T04:33:53.216+0000)\n>\n> Yes we talk a lot about story and thematic when developing a new skin line or expanding on an old one.

If we do a good job some of this will come through in the final product, but right now our approach is to leave the interpretation of skins more open because there's no need to close doors on player's interpretations. If one player sees a reference to Anime in Star Guardian Lux, another player envisions an alternate timeline where Academy Lux and her friends are secretly defenders of the galaxy and yet another player imagines that Lux moonlights as a magical defender of Demacia because she is shut away studying during the day by her over-protective brother, who are we to tell them otherwise.\n\nIn the Project universe Fiora saved Yi, but are they lovers or old friends? Perhaps Fiora leads a resistance and they've never met until that moment? Is Lucian allied with them or did they hire him on for that one mission? Skins is about setting a stage and inspiring players. Personally I'd love to do some solid 'Skins' stories, but considering the core lore is only just starting to gain momentum it could potentially be confusing right now.","replies":[{"poster":"Chromatic Eagle","date":"2015-11-01T04:45:55.761+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So what's the story behind Infernals and Demon Vi?

Blade Mistress Morgana and Aether Wing Kayle are definitely opposed, they seem to be taking inspiration from SC and serving as a 'one off' rivalry (although then there's Blade Queen Lissandra and I guess I'd have to ask Zeronis about that one).\n\nPFE was the first straight sci fi skin. There was an idea recently that the Reaper-esque Eternum would be the villains in his dire timeline. Sounds cool to me.\n\nProject has forces on both sides of the law, with the connecting themes being cybernetic enhancement augmenting powerful digital magic. They are definitely in a future that could incorporate other skins though, anything in that 'Ghost in the Shell' or 'Metal Gear Revengeance\" era.\n\nInfernal has the most solid backstory, serving as the dark force opposing Arclight in a more Diablo-y kind of fantasy world. Some demons are malicious like Nasus, stoic like Galio or playful like Vi. The Arclights are champions chosen by the mighty deity Vel'koz to hunt down and stop the demons when they manifest. I specifically asked Pan about the setting of the Demon Vi to make sure he was thinking about the plane that the demons spring forth from when painting it.","replies":[{"poster":"Chromatic Eagle","date":"2015-11-02T03:44:47.116+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So Blade Mistress and Aether Wing share the same universe?\n\nWhat about those Riot skins?

Its not explicitly stated but its story telling just as much as VO lines and even their animations lend to their character's story.
