If she was reduced in base, she would be pretty boned. In comparison to other ADC's, her total AS with the normal items is 140% with minigun, plus 17% from levels, and 50% from Phantom or 40% from Shiv, so she's at 197-207%. Other ADC's, we'll go with Ezreal as a funny comparison given the fact he Q's more than AA's. He's got the same base of .625 and has 47.6% scaling and 50% max with his passive and if he builds a PD or Shiv (Hasn't gone Shiv since they made Shiv not crit unless the AA crits, but we'll say he doooooooes for the lulz) he'll have 137.6-147.6%. In actuality, this is actually 1.485-1.55ish. Jinx's AS would be 1.856-1.92ish. At max with the PD, that's .37 attacks per second from minigun Jinx compared to Ezreal who... doesn't really build these items, but why the hell not use them for random comparison of BS? lol. Wiiiiiithout the minigun, Jinx's AS is only a bonus of 57-67%, so that's .98-1.04 attacks per second. The difference between the minigun and rockets is 1 attack per 2s. DPS-wise, the minigun will do nearly double after max stacks since her attack speed is nearly halved without minigun, buuuuuut logically, if you got about 300 AD, you're critting 750 with minigun and 825 with rockets (330x2.5 since rockets do 110% of your AD rather than just the 100%. Kalista's AA's work the same in which her AA's do 90% and crit for 180% pre-IE and post-IE for 225%, just like Yasuo's crits!). As most will understand, it's a lot easier to orb walk with less AS and typically around 1.5 attacks per sec, it's almost impossible to orb walk and get off the max attacks per sec with near 2 attacks per sec since you'd have to stop to AA every half sec. That level of stutter step would be insane and I've personally never seen it ever, so Rockets are just better later on in a team fight. You'll do AoE, do more per hit, and you'll be able to maximize DPS.\n\nHonestly, the last stack of the minigun after max level and a PD is just for objectives since you're not going to orb walk or stutter step quick when you gotta stop every half a second to attack.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"RogueWill","date":"2015-10-23T06:45:03.043+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The attack rate is slow but not really that impactful.

And some BS excuse like the low AS one doesn't change that fact. Actually, if the low AS was never mean to be a weakness, the fact that no one in the balance team ever thought that giving something so many strengths without even thinking it needed a weakness to balance it out says a lot about the balance team.\n\nIt's the same as when people say \"Lee Sin falls off late game\" which he does but he still has tools to ignore that weakness, only difference is that Lee's approach to mitigate his weakness takes skill while Jinx's is because her kit is loaded with so much stuff that she can't possibly mess up.\n\nThat's the entire point of the \"no weakness\" argument, which would be better said as \"Too many strengths, non-existent weaknesses\"\n\nIt's the same argument that is brought in some game boards that says \"If a spells takes 20 secs to cast but one shots everything, is it balanced?\" Of course Jinx's is an much smaller scale but the concept still applies. Because that's exactly how it feels to play against Jinx, can you consistently deny her in teamfights? pretty well you're good to go. You can't?
