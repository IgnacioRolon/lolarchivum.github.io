Honestly, i'd rather see riot fix up old champs rather than introduce new ones. As you introduce new champs the older ones become obsolete, so reworking oldies as to ensure the power creep doesn't get out of hand seems like the most logical, and best thing to do for the game and its players.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Solidair3","date":"2015-04-14T12:52:18.032+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"As in 6 new champs or does this count updates like Poppy/Taric as well?","replies":[{"poster":"Jeddy017","date":"2015-04-14T15:53:19.577+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The champion updates are done by a different team.So no,this doesn't count updates.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DisasterSola","date":"2015-04-14T07:23:05.710+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=sfkABkt6,comment-id=000200000000,timestamp=2015-04-14T07:09:25.125+0000)\n>\n> We've got 6 champs in the pipeline at the moment.
