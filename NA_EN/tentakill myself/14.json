Ranked is FAR TOO EASY to get into right now, and SHOULD be tightened up in several areas. You can spend barely 10k IP in champs and jump into ranked, and then lose every game because you're an idiot who doesn't know the first thing about how the game operates. That's an argument for locking it down, not preventing needed game functions like more bans.\n\n Secondly, bans are exactly intended to ban out problem champs for your strategy- that's code for \"shit you don't want to deal with\". But when you have as many broken nonsense champs as this game does, it becomes \"work out what the ban meta is and follow it unless you try to get one of them yourself\". Since the balance team has proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that their one priority is keeping LCS big plays champs in vogue and that they couldn't care less about the state of the game for the rest of us this problem is not going to go away anytime soon. Ten bans should be seen as a minimum.\n\n edit: Also, the \"ban out an entire role\" argument is complete nonsense. For this to happen, you would need 10 players to have the same idea at the same time (remember, teams cannot communicate) and the second player decides to go for it after a single ban. This simply isn't going to happen in the real world, and even if the stars align and it does ONCE, who the hell cares?

Amost all those champions i put in have some form of long range poke ability that can also be used as a high damage output/execute. Kindred can be played as an ADC and can be done successfully but you would have to sacrifice high amounts of stacks off your passive and snag a few from enemy Gromp/Blue Buff or the Scuttler near bot lane. Ahri wouldn't work like TF, Gnar, or Nid because of the fact she relies on ability spam over auto attacking and lacks several passive buffs those peticular champs have.

Cho'gath is also a viable off meta support as he uses relic shield well and has an AoE knock up, slow, and silence that can keep his ADC on the better side of their health bar. Yas isn't a reliable support as his wall takes too long on cooldown and he takes away from his murder power. Anyone who plays Yi support is an idiot as he isn't designed to be one.
