Because they nerfed her when it came out and despite what people think, she was already a really strong jungler with the old Devourer. Shyvana killing people in 3-4 autos didn't start with Sated; I was doing that with the old Devourer and Botrk. That's just what a Shyvana that rushes multiple damage items does. People are so used to Shyvana's that rush sunfire cape and more recently cinderhulk that they forgot just how much damage Shyvana does when she builds damage. It's not the item friends. It's the champion. And that champion doesn't need nerfed; she retains all the same weaknesses as before   and is still inferior to whoever the dominant gank oriented junglers of the time are.","replies":[{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-08-09T10:29:48.565+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Her win rate has dropped because of how fricken powerful she has become.
