I have  now gained the ~~stacks~~ ~~power~~ knowledge I have been searching for, and, after testing myself, have discovered it is simply Rito's April fool's surprise.\n\nAs I was spectating a friend of mine, he told me his opponents were all bots. Curious, I decided to start spectating and see for myself. Blue Team's {{champion:75}}Toplaner was spamming taunt under tower as their {{champion:106}}Jungler  prepared for an invade by himself. Against a {{champion:107}}Rengar. Ha. Ha! AHAHAHA-- I noticed, however, that every player, including the \"bots\" had usernames and even some clan tags. My friend said that his {{champion:21}}lane opponent had the username \"Miss Fourtune Bot\", but I saw his/her username and clan tag like a regular Summoner's.\n\n---------\n---------\n\n\n##(Not exactly sure where to put this, so I&#039;ll just put it here in Gameplay)\nI checked League&#039;s service site and found this message saying: \n> Unranked SR games may be randomly selected for Advanced Bot testing. We appreciate your patience with any bugs or glitches you may encounter.\n\nI haven&#039;t encountered any bugs, I was just curious on what this could possibly be. Will it affect SR games in any way? Is it searching for bots, or creating them? _Thank you for reading!_\n######Please do not downvote this post, I am just asking a question because I do not know the answer yet. :J","replies":[{"poster":"Mysticman89","date":"2017-04-01T03:31:43.927+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"They're not actually bots, you're still matchmade against 5 regular players. The game just displays them all as ____ bot and removes all chat, as well as putting in those extra messages so they seem like bots. It's the april fools thing.\n\nSimilarly, you and your teammates also appear as bots to the opposing team, so both sides are made to 'think' they're playing bots, when really it's humans vs humans.","replies":[{"poster":"Evêñtfûl Hôrïzôñ","date":"2017-04-01T03:33:51.448+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahh, I see, thanks! I thought of that when I watched a friend's game of mine after he said he was versus all bots.

They are sometimes bugged, running on exact the same route, or running against each other and then stacking together running in one place.
