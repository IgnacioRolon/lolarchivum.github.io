I do not personally know if this is supposed to happen or not so i wanted to bring it up. And please do not give a copy pasted response by saying you did not connect to the game leaving your team at a disadvantage etc. It just does not make sense that the remake was made even though i was able to join and cast a vote making it a 2-3 decision.","replies":[{"poster":"Carry This Scrub","date":"2018-01-08T15:31:30.404+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why on earth you don't need a majority to vote for yes in a remake situation?

If anyone is marked by the time the 3:00 mark rolls by, a remake vote begins and requires 30% of the team to vote \"*yes\" for the remake to go through. In a 4v5 (one person marked) it only takes 2 votes to pass. I suggest checking out our [**/Remake FAQ**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/208754686--Remake-FAQ) for more details on how the system works.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KÃ¼rama","date":"2016-12-18T22:43:47.383+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In 4v5s, only 2 yes's are required to remake a game.
