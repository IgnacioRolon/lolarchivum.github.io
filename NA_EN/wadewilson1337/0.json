The track record for ranked is that most people queueing up for support are not queueing alone. As a support main I can tell you that there is no way in hell I will queue for support solo. This community in-game is 100% prepared to throw anyone but themselves under the bus, with support and jungle as the 2 main targets, if you're brave enough to queue as support in a purely solo scenario knowing that most people sub diamond are just there to stroke their egos and get a lot of kills and fancy plays then be my guest, I'd much rather have Dynamic Queue so I can know that at least the ENTIRE team won't be reporting me because I am literally unable to stop my carry from diving into the entire enemy team with reckless abandon.\n\nSure, some support players would still prefer a purely solo queue like back in the old days of the first ranked season, but how many do you think that's really going to be? If you think queue times are long now oh buddy, when I first started ranked people were about ready to trace somebody's IP and shoot up their house before they would willingly go support with randoms. Queues now are like 5 minutes tops if you queue for purely carry roles, At a low-ball guess I'd say that in pure solo you'd be looking at like 15 minute queues if there was still pre-game role selection because you know how Riot hates the meta changing from 1/1/2 lanes with a jungler, and without role selection beforehand all the raging comes back and suddenly the support role is back to being \"The poor guy who got stuck with 5th pick\".\n\nIf solo queue gets added then sweet, more people get what they want, fine by me, but on the other hand the potential for Riot to waste a lot of time getting the separated ranked stats going, having multiple ranked queues going at once trying to match people together at a similar skill level in a way that feels rewarding to players beyond just winning a game for it to just flop because of the unpopularity of the support role leading to its eventual removal again (hi Dominion) is something perfectly reasonable to be worried about. At the end of the day people want Solo queue to be ranked and competitive, just like the solo/quo queue was, and now Dynamic Queue, they want it taken seriously, and Riot is afraid that it will flop and be a waste of time, effort, and money trying to make it what people want.","replies":[{"poster":"macromite","date":"2016-03-24T14:13:50.770+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"this is pretty much exactly what I mean, you should post this as its own discussion somewhere.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Velzard of Koz","date":"2016-03-24T20:32:18.977+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem is people might not want SoloQ \"to play alone\" with their ADC being stranger, but maybe for nearly 100% chance of fair play where the enemy ADC and Support are not premaded either.

I believe If implemented in-game, it would be more attractive for usage (that's for possible argument you still can make Skype call in the background If you ask the stranger). True, they might still decline, but Riot might reward voicechat based game the way they keep rewarding premades (party rewards, more chances for keys) to insipre players to voicechat games the way they insipre them now to premade games. True, toxic kids will remain toxic kids, but you will more easily have logical argument about why you haven't done what they wanted you to do via direct speech (it's quicker, easier and can be done simultaneously while playing). And people tend to watch their manners more the more factors of real-life coopertaion is given. This would ensure toxicbuster level similar If not equal to that of DynaQ while featuring fairness in players playing first time together and being ranked like that in one ladder together.\n\nSeveral things to note. These suggestion are not meant to replace DynaQ as ultimate solution of fed wolf and living lamb, it's just a possible way how SoloQ may ensure supports not turning into others' b!tches. Also, I realise the price of SoloQ and am not straightly saying it creates majority. Last but not least, my post was more about Riot not speaking more specifically about those major issues players rant about non-stop on forums. 80% of the post is how DynaQ is cool with slight issues they're working on and stuff while one paragraph expressess Socrates' worries about SoloQ.

It would go one way or the other.\n\nI don't think that is the case. Queue times are decently long as is right now despite how many players we have and that's especially true for people who select exclusively carry roles - there's a reason people complain that if you don't pick Fill or Support, you end up being punished with eternal queue times. Given how big an issue this is already, exacerbating it by splitting the playerbase in half is dangerous. You are talking significant queue time extensions to everything except support because... how could there not be extensions?\n\nI don't see it going one way or the other either, unless people are massively overestimating the popularity of solo queue and it's going to heavily lean towards dynamic. Too many people enjoy playing in premades for solo queue to ever take up a vast majority of the ranked playerbase (especially with team 5s incorporated into dynamic queue) and so the coexistence of the two queues can only result in them both taking up a decent chunk of the playerbase (resulting in extended queue times for both) or dynamic queue winning outright (resulting in massive solo queue waits and probably eventual deletion).\n\nI don't massively care which queue ends up being the dominant one but I think Riot is correct to worry about the impact that introducing solo queue would have. If it was popular enough to contend with dynamic queue but not popular enough to flat out replace it then queue times would be a lot worse and matchmaking would be worsened on top of that. And if it wasn't popular then it would just be a failure, obviously. I think a lot of the people most passionately campaigning about solo queue haven't really thought about the potential consequences of adding it (i.e. they haven't thought that something might be worrying Riot beyond \"oh no, our precious dynamic queue!\") and I also think there is a fool's paradise of sorts present here where people are assuming the situation is much more heavily in their favour than it may well be (\"EVERYONE wants solo queue, EVERYONE is comfortable with never playing a premade game in ranked again!\" - how confident can you be in this statement?).\n\nIt is something that needs careful consideration. That Riot decided to take the time to consider it *after* they announced that solo queue would come back is ridiculous and a huge mistake on their part but the consideration itself is necessary. You can't just assume that everything would work out perfectly.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CuteGuy6pack","date":"2016-03-23T21:11:41.223+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MotherTeresa1910,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=wlEIEI9x,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2016-03-23T17:53:09.084+0000)\n>\n> But what do they do in the more likely case that neither solo queue nor dynamic queue are significantly more popular than the other, but they're both taking enough away from each other that neither of them are as popular as they need to be?

There was already normal games to play with your friends and even a team ranked to get a ranked game with friends of all skill levels.\n\nIt wasn't broken and Riot went and made it broken by forcing us to play a way half the people didn't want to play in the first place. I think it's fair to say the majority of players play ranked solo, why even bother putting in premades like 3 or 4 queues that force solo players in their games. It's silly to be honest. They need to make a dynamic queue where 2's and 3's pair together and 5's and leave solo's to solo queue with their own ranking system.","replies":[{"poster":"Abyssphere","date":"2016-03-23T21:46:21.223+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=CuteGuy6pack,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=wlEIEI9x,comment-id=00030002,timestamp=2016-03-23T21:11:41.223+0000)\n>\n> It's not a better option though.

I think last year it would have been easier to assume whether solos or duos were more popular (I reckon solo) but it's a very different queue now, with a lot more flexibility for people who want to play together for one thing. So it's really impossible for us to assess the situation with as little information as we have. Frankly I'm not sure Riot can even make a conclusive judgment with the data *they* have, but if I had to trust someone between myself and them to decide which one the playerbase is best off with, I'd trust them. They know more than us and there's no particular incentive for them to be biased towards one mode over the other. Realistically, \"we don't like to be proven wrong\" isn't a reasonable motivation for a business and while that hasn't necessarily stopped businesses in the past, one would expect people to learn from their mistakes.\n\nIt is a big deal for people who *only* liked playing ranked solely for the competitive aspect of it that is watered down in dynamic queue, so I do hope Riot decides that solo queue can viably be released. At the same time, I just don't feel comfortable saying we should just replace dynamic queue with it when it could well be a highly successful queue despite the controversy. Really what I'd most like from Riot is data on the issue. They've only provided very small amounts and that can easily be construed as them having something to hide.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
