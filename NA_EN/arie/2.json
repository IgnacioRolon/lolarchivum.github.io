As a ripe level 14, I was still pretty new to League, and my champion knowledge wasn’t very diverse. A friend of mine suggested I try to learn support to level up my map awareness, so I immediately bought Janna and excitedly hopped into a game with my friends. I was ready to become a support god.\n\nShortly after hitting level six, my friend jumped down to bot for a gank. “Use your ult!” he urged me over Skype. So I enthusiastically pressed R right then and there, smugly thinking, “I did it! I AM A SUPPORT GOD!,” only to see the nearly dead enemies blown away from us back to the safety of their own turret. Oops!\n\nSo, what are_ your_ embarrassing League stories? I know I'm not the only one!","replies":[{"poster":"Glyceroll","date":"2015-07-06T22:03:35.468+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":2,"body":"One time I was playing as Zilean and I forgot to ult the Vayne.

Me and my friend Vince were playing a normal game with my friend's cousin. Vince was trying out Vi, I was Zil, and his cousin was Quinn ADC. So Vince comes in for the gank, and they're both really low, and it comes down to a turret dive. I pinged for Vince to go in, and he did, and I pressed ult...on Quinn.\n\nDOUBLE KILL!\n\nSHUT DOWN!\n\n2. This was when I was around level 15 or so, and was playing Sona with Vince and another friend that we'll call Jason. I mostly forget who was who, but I remember a mid Kat and Vince as jungle Naut. We're teamfighting around dragon, and I flash ult...completely missing, and got bursted down by the jungler/mid laner. Never lived that down.\n\n3. This was on my own, and I was jungling as Nunu. I wasn't paying attention, and being my overexcited self, run to the jungle. The bot lane helps me leash...but I realize something:\n\nI have no potions\n\nI have no trinket\n\nI have no machete.\n\nBlushing, I recall back, and run back over. Made it just as minions spawned.\n\n4. Was playing Nunu jungle again, and was doing the Nunu patented level-4-solo-dragon. Heart pounding, sweat pouring, breathing heavy. I see the jungle Udyr at midline...which is when I should have disengaged the dragon. Me, being the Faker that I am, has already used my smite to burst down the dragon faster and I didn't have double charges. So the Udyr goes to gank bot...and see's me. He stands there, with turtle stance, watching me for 5 seconds. Dragon is as 1K health, and I keep doing it, spamming my Q to try and steal away the steal...half a second to Q, he smite stole it, and turned his attention the the 1/3 health me from tanking dragon.\n\nI had given up on life, and did the worst flash escape attempt over the dragon wall, which ended my in front of the wall with a basically full healthed Udyr. I died, and almost quit the game. Did end up winning though because Vince carried top lane was Mundo.\n\nBut over my time in lol, I've missed plenty of Amumu Q's, accidentally pressed Flash and ults, screw up taunts as Shen, misuse shen ults, but these were some of my best stories.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Syndrarella","date":"2015-07-06T22:16:12.285+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Glyceroll","date":"2015-07-06T22:43:04.852+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've done this more times than I'd care to admit...better safe than sorry!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Solidair3","date":"2015-07-07T01:58:29.227+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"the worst is when you realize it was the clone as you're pressing the button but then you fully press R and there's no going back.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"PlayboiAri","date":"2015-07-06T22:04:32.836+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just recently, I used my bard ult, tried to lock down enemy vayne she wa really low, but then she tumbled out of my ult, and I ulted 4 members of my team, and then got flanked my wukong .-. #SilverPlays","replies":[]},{"poster":"7ha7guy777","date":"2015-07-06T22:02:35.807+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I overestimated my ult range as Galio during a teamfight. 0 man full duration ult op","replies":[]},{"poster":"Demon Diana","date":"2015-07-06T22:00:03.313+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":21,"body":"sorry to be a jerk about this but why dont you invest you time more properly admin and bring attention to the issue alot, and i mean alot of players are having right now, if you dont know what im talking about please take a look, i love league a lot and actually invest good time into it. right now i cant play as well as many other players and when we get in a game it auto dc's and we lose our lp and get punished by leaver buster here is the problem thread:\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/NZfBhApx-game-crashing-disconnecting-in-champ-select","replies":[{"poster":"Sky Shadow","date":"2015-07-06T22:04:19.166+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=cobbel,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=1zjlfIj8,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-07-06T22:00:03.313+0000)\n>\n> sorry to be a jerk about this but why dont you invest you time more properly admin and bring attention to the issue alot, and i mean alot of players are having right now, if you dont know what im talking about please take a look, i love league a lot and actually invest good time into it. right now i cant play as well as many other players and when we get in a game it auto dc's and we lose our lp and get punished by leaver buster here is the problem thread:\n> http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/NZfBhApx-game-crashing-disconnecting-in-champ-select\n\nNo offense man, but that's not her job.\n\nShe's a Social Media Specialist.\n\nThat's like asking your gardener to fix an electricity problem you have.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TurtleMan878","date":"2015-07-06T23:34:07.078+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"The best one I can think of is when I({{champion:117}} accidentally ulted our shacos clone instead of the real one.
