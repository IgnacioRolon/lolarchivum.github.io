I don’t know about you guys, but I’ve been practicing with my duo queue partner like crazy to prep for the new ranked season, and I’m so ready to reap in the sweet, sweet LP.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/K72eCNt.gif\n\nI bet that my duo queue partner can beat up yours.  He plays the meanest, most aggro Draven I’ve ever seen, and our bot lane synergy is super on point.  Whether I’m landing a spontaneous Nami bubble on an overextended enemy, or a Sona ult on the entire enemy team, I can always count on him to capitalize without dropping a single axe. When we win, our mingled nerd screams and triumphant cries of victory can be heard for miles. Even when my big plays don’t go as planned, he manages to keep me in good spirits by making me laugh and staying positive. \n\nFor those of you who regularly play ranked duos: **Tell me about your main duo buddy**! Who's the Valor to your Quinn? The Thresh to your Lucian (in a game synergy sense, not, uh, you know)? How'd you meet? What roles do you play? And what on earth makes you think you can take us?","replies":[{"poster":"Ondrox","date":"2015-01-20T20:58:07.651+0000","up_votes":90,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:32}}  Myself","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mattheous","date":"2015-01-20T20:46:04.544+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Two of my best duo parterns are junglers (one I met through online gaming and the other one used to be one of my closest irl friend), me being main support, we easily fed the adc and started to go all around the map getting more kills and securing objectives.

We live across the country from each other, but I got to meet him in person at Season 2 Worlds.

Our team includes us 3.Our map only has 1 lane and  we affectionately call it the island. we are stranded, our lane partner (who we now call wilson) usually abandons us leaving the island. Most of the time its because he gets mad at us and we toss him off the island. In our off time we listen to the winds who try to talk to us. They carry a rumor about someone called a jungler. Maybe if we investigate the island long enough we will find this jungler. However most of the time we end up getting attacked by some hungry bandits who seem  rather well fed. But we live on. These towers keep getting in our way of progressing further into the island. Sadly it seems however that we are stuck in this same conquest every day. we destroy the towers and this huge stone called a nexus. However when we awake after we destroy it, it seems that the day starts over. When we return to home base we see others. This \"Shopkeeper\" likes to \"sell\" us items. However they always tend to disappear as well when the day starts over. However we think its the island getting to us. Its trying to make me think there are others with us. However we know that this is a lie.  Maybe it thinks we will find peace and not want to leave, the problem is  cant. Me wants to believe other wise, myself is the logical thinker however and helps remind us that this is how it is. we fear the lack of the voice in my head that says \"victory\". We fear if we were to leave it would mean defeat. For now we will continue on in our endeavors until a friendly champion shows up. The only thing that changes is the object on our scroll. A few weeks ago it said gold, now it says platinum. As much as we want to get off this island without defeat our desire to know what is above this \"platinum\". We want to know what it means. The days seem to be getting easier as the opponents we face seem to be repeats. our imagination might be running out of creativity and on a loop. we doubt society will accept us back when not even those who seem to come around us seem to reject us as well. Its not like I was accepted by society before this incident. No one ever congratulated us on our efforts, no one seemed to help anyways. Now that we think about it... have we always been on the island? Have we just been crazy for all these years having imagined up a previous life for ourselves? we hope not. But until we know for sure is that we stuck in duo (trio) queue with me myself and I\n\nAnd this is the story of my duo queueing days","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pythagorean Thm","date":"2015-01-20T21:58:19.144+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"My duo partner is named Sam.\n\nSam is a cat, and he mains katarina.
