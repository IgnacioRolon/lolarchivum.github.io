You can tell before you even get into the game what you're in for because they try to act like him.  It's better to dodge because when you load, in-game it's even worse.  (Disrespectin' when they don't know how or when an opportunity arises, trying and failing to lead a chase around the map that gets stopped a few feet from the start point, trying to act tough and trash talk while they're feeding like FEMA and gave up the last 3 drags and baron to make it obvious they were disrespectin' etc...)\n\nI mean, Trick is entertaining, but his rabid wannabe Udyr pro fancult members are predominantly so incredibly stupid that they defy reason to be considered human beings.","replies":[{"poster":"MrBuffington","date":"2015-05-15T23:46:09.902+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I played Udyr long before I knew who Trick2g was; Phoenix Udyr was the first champion I learned to jungle with.

There was a short while back in the dredges of bronze 5 where I just didn't understand why I couldn't advance that I just started playing whatever the pros did... I then realized I absolutely hated doing that, I was just another person jumping on the bandwagon at that point and that is something I have striven never to be. So that is when I decided to quit trying to do everything and just play the champs I like. So far that has worked for me.\n\nAll that said though I do appreciate and enjoy watching the pro and still try to pick up a few tips and tricks from their gameplay.

It takes ppl willing to do stuff that might fail, on purpose, in order to know what does and does not work in order to create new strategies and possibly metas.\n\nIn short, don't do what top players do just because they are a top player. ***Know*** why what they do works so that you may not only do it as well, but find out how to counteract it with a new strat of your own.","replies":[]},{"poster":"major ferret","date":"2015-05-24T18:19:23.699+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"true pros come up with their own shit\n\nbut I do watch them to learn something","replies":[]},{"poster":"MJayMonkey","date":"2015-05-24T09:12:33.601+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Haha, not anymore, I made this up.

I've finally upgraded my overall win rate with a champion that is supposedly the least chosen and won with in this current meta.\n\nI'm proud of my self. And give thanks for all those streamers out there that take the time to evaluate their gameplay experience and share it with their viewers. \n\nP.S.. \"Everybody, and i mean EVERYBODY, has their own method of play style.
