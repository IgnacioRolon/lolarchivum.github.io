Yasuo can easily cover a whole minion wave with his unlimited dashes.\n\nRiven can about cover 1 1/3 Renekton dashes with her 4 dashes. They're also her damage, so if she uses all of them getting to you, well have fun destroying her! Doesn't work if she's fed and can oneshot you, ofc.\n\nRiven also needs to use her Q's to do damage, meaning her escape is pretty shit if she wants to, you know, hurt you.

But keep in mind that a Riven with only 1 Q left is still super weak, so that's a potential 9 second window.
