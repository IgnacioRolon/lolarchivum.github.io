With that in mind, I'm not sure if it makes sense to print extra rulebooks after each iteration.  But the plan is to give you access to each iteration.","replies":[{"poster":"cheolkeong","date":"2017-05-17T23:08:17.481+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know someone has already asked in another post, but since there is no chance of an expansion or sequel in the near future do you think it would be possible to release assets for the community to make fan-made content? We all love the game and I think that could be a good way of maintaining an active fanbase for it. It has plenty of replay value as is but if it is really set in stone that there will never be a sequel it'd be great if the community could get going on making their own stuff.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Warlord Scrap","date":"2017-04-28T01:28:17.229+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"But there made so nice even if it was pod for rulebooks id pay to keep the quality.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CYÆGHA","date":"2017-05-29T20:37:48.593+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wonder what's the new update in the Rule Books?","replies":[{"poster":"Warlord Scrap","date":"2017-05-29T21:13:23.030+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/143267/english-rulebook-wave-2\nthe second part is the updated rules specifically","replies":[{"poster":"CYÆGHA","date":"2017-05-29T21:31:50.537+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you very much! {{champion:3}}","replies":[{"poster":"Warlord Scrap","date":"2017-05-29T21:33:26.853+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"np","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"LuckerNoob","date":"2017-04-23T11:37:28.328+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"iirc, Kades said (on BGG), there would be a rules update available as a .pdf","replies":[]}]}
