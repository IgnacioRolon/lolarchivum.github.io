I have reviewed the chats from my 3 games and believe that due to chats Ive seen even in very very recent patches by players such as(imaqtpie, hashinshin, yassuo, voyboy, etc.) that these chat logs are by no means reason for a permanent ban. I'll go through each chat and let you know the context so you can decide for yourself if my account should be continued to be permanently banned. \r\n1. \r\nWardenJoe: hey ahri\r\nWardenJoe: ur school called\r\nWardenJoe: they want their desktop back\r\n-a joke, said because ahri took 5 minutes in loading screen\r\n2. \r\nWardenJoe: thanks..\r\nWardenJoe: bro\r\nWardenJoe: shut up\r\nWardenJoe: ggwp\r\nWardenJoe: im running down jg'\r\n-said because our ekko jungle dove their tier 2 bottom turret alone lvl 1 and said lul in chat. i still leashed him and i tried my best in lane against the tristana, but her support was playing well so we ended up losing bottom very hard. i didn't run down jungle(was said as a joke), and the jax jungles game report will show that as he was 0/0/0 until i believe 15 minutes in the game.\r\n3. \r\nWardenJoe: shut\r\nWardenJoe: the fuck\r\nWardenJoe: up\r\n-was being flamed and wanted them to stop. I 100% agree with that I shouldve muted the players this game, but is asking someone to stop flaming me a bad thing?\r\n4.\r\nWardenJoe: exhaust thresh\r\nWardenJoe: really smart\r\nWardenJoe: after hes used his 2 damaging skills\r\nWardenJoe: exhu\r\nWardenJoe: exhausting a thresh\r\nWardenJoe: after he hooked and flayed\r\nWardenJoe: really samrt\r\nWardenJoe: i told her\r\nWardenJoe: she exhausted a thresh\r\nWardenJoe: after he hook flayed\r\nWardenJoe: how is thattoxic\r\nWardenJoe: ekko dove a tier 2 turret lvl 1\r\nWardenJoe: and thats not inting?\r\n-they said i was inting, when my support had said in post game that they haven't played since 2012 and hopped straight into a ranked game. \r\n5.\r\nWardenJoe: tell me i suck buddy\r\nWardenJoe: when my support ints my laner 3 times\r\nWardenJoe: due to being \"bad\"\r\n-our udyr was flaming me in game and in post game. what happened was our lulu ran into the alistar kog maw 3 times in a row and died before she was even level 3, and refused to shield me or ult me all game. \r\n6.\r\nWardenJoe: muted\r\nWardenJoe: toxic feeding\r\nWardenJoe: lucian 1k gold above me\r\nWardenJoe: ori\r\nWardenJoe: ur a bully\r\nWardenJoe: and getting reported\r\nWardenJoe: stop feeding\r\nWardenJoe: pls\r\n-orianna was constantly pinging my lane and my death timers despite the fact that we were being camped bottom and were only 0/2. i muted her after i said this and tried to get the team back into the game with our nasus and evelynn and she said she was reporting me for trolling, even though i was trying my best all game.\r\n7.\r\nWardenJoe: we got 0 help\r\nWardenJoe: its gg\r\nWardenJoe: dont expect anything\r\nWardenJoe: thats what\r\nWardenJoe: i learned\r\nWardenJoe: im  not dying\r\nWardenJoe: and

yeah\r\nWardenJoe: not too happy rn\r\nI knew both the rakan and orianna were reporting me for no good reason after game, and told this to the nasus and evelynn, and despite knowing this, i still fought to help the team win the game, because my ultimate goal is to have fun in victory and help my team win the game as much as possible.\r\n8.\r\nWardenJoe: report me\r\nWardenJoe: trolling\r\nWardenJoe: gg\r\nSarcasm, check the game on op.gg, i was most definitely not trolling i was 9/5/7 coming from an 0/2/0 laning phase where we were 4 man pressured off our first turret. so i sat bot and farmed up until i was caught up enough to do damage and help the team.\r\nGame 1\r\nWardenJoe: hey ahri\r\nWardenJoe: ur school called\r\nWardenJoe: they want their desktop

this ban, and overall it does look like you're going out of your way to belittle or argue with teammates or enemies about how they're playing instead of focusing on the game.

It definitely applies to in-game communication, but reading through it's mostly talking about feedback to us.\n\nFocusing on constructive feedback in-game portion though, a lot of this doesn't seem very constructive but rather just trying to put others down. Things like:\n\n> WardenJoe: report her pls\n> WardenJoe: ik u saw that udyr\n> WardenJoe: is lulu just bad\n> WardenJoe: or trolling\n\n...don't really serve to help someone get better but just call out how bad you think they are. Asking for further reports repeatedly can also be viewed negatively in certain situations like this, where you could simply report them on your own after the match. Overall, we're not experts on these matters here.
