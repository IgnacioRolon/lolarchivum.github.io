I have literally done EVERYTHING in the login issues page and nothing has worked, ive reinstalled, ive done port forwarding, ive done the IE settings, ive tried wiping my DNS and doing 8.8. whatever bs, ive tried disabling my firewall, ive tried repairing the client and still NOTHING. It consistently tells me it cant connect to the server, but heres the kicker: whenever I go to my boyfriends house and play i can log in and everything is fine. But the second i try to do it at home I get this stuff. Im really frustrated and i've already submitted a ticket but I havent gotten a response and i just want to play star guardian jinx. Pls someone help me :((((","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-08T21:59:46.203+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It does sound like your network is failing to connect to the login servers, but there are a few other things that can be tested.  Instead of the login issues guide, there are steps in the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide that may be fruitful.  Specifically, I recommend downloading our [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) to auto-configure your firewall settings just in case.  I know you've tried a few steps already, and I appreciate that!  It's really important to go over everything though to make sure all possibilities are ruled out.  Let me know!","replies":[]}]}
