My ping always raise up to 400-500 ping and stay there for a long time,and randomly DC. I always get ridiculously high amount of ping in game, yesterday my ping went up to 18000!!","url":"https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/i0peuxIL-getting-huge-lag-spikes-only-in-lolinternet-is-fine","image":"https://cdn.leagueoflegends.com/apollo/assets/vb/boards-wallpaper.jpg"},"up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In about 80% of my games, there is a problem with the ping. I have the game on lowest graphics and lowest possible levels of performance. Even so, when i play a fucking game, I can barely actually \"PLAY\" the game,  because suddenly in the middle of fighting my ping spikes from 30ms to about 14k ms and says \"Trying to reconnect\" or some bullsh!t, then I wait a few minutes, hoping that the game will actually fucking reconnect me, and it never does, at least to normal ping again. Instead, I have to CTRL+ALT+DELETE to minimize the window (because you cant fucking minimize the shitty window anyway) then check my internet connection, which takes about 1 minute to troubleshoot, then return on to the game after this problem (E.G, DNS Server is not responding, Default gateway is not available, Invalid IP, God knows.) on my **Fiber optic high-quality virgin media broadband** that is most of the time on 5 bars, then i return to the damn game, and it either happens again, meaning i have to CTRL+ALT+DELETE to minimize, then task manager, then shut down league and reboot (which works like 50% of the time) but it will mean i've wasted another 5 minutes or so which means i totally lost about 10 minutes of the game and my team has already lost, not to forget that they all blame/flame me because I lagged out.\n\nI've researched it, and there is plenty of fucking threads, mainly about EUW and NA, that show complaints about lag spikes. In the thread I've linked, which is one of many examples, no riot employee has replied. It's time to step up to the fucking podium and start dishing out some fuckin help or something, seriously. It's a game-ruining problem for not just 1 person but everyone on their team in the game ffs. I can't climb the ranks because shit like this always happens, the highest MS i've ever had is 46000 (from 30).\n\nSort it out.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-24T03:17:31.646+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Seeing your ping jump from 30ms to a literal 14k ms and then that \"trying to reconnect\" message popping up is a pretty dang good sign that you've lost your connection to the servers. It doesn't mean your internet is bad, but sometimes a network can just run into weird issues. \n\nWe should be able to narrow down the root issue by going through the steps [**here**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues).
