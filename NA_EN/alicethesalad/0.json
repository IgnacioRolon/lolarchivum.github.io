Rather than completely replacing the only one. (though my only problem with the new one is the hair. they should keep the old hair style.)\n\nBut if you do end up replacing the default skin. Can you at least make the classic skin available. (preferably for not too much.)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lucifer","date":"2015-07-23T21:21:45.064+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'd love something based off Erika from Fire Emblem.

There's that Chosen/Foresaken concept also floating around. I would also **BEG** you to consider a traditional skin. \n\n Honestly. I'd settle for even a Chroma at this point. \n\nHonestly, Fiora hasn't gotten any skin love other than that halloween \"Skin\" I don't like talking about and that was back in 2012.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CloudyMarc","date":"2015-08-06T03:42:20.139+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"OOOOOOHHHH!
