I've been on an honor streak for a long time, and I just had about 3 - 4 bad games in a row where just 1 - 2 people did inexcusably bad. God forbid I tell our 0/7 Xerath who is sitting in base spamming /ff that he is garbage, and that he can't land a stun to save his life. No, I should be more careful than that, I might get chat banned for 31 games in a row.\r\n\r\nYeah I did it for 3-4 games, its still bullshit. How many players got into a good mood after winning 1 - 2 games in a row, and in their excitement decided to be self righteous and apologize to the opposing team for their only positive/threatening player who was a little bit mean to the other fellow feeders. And of those people I wonder how many get on the tribunal between wins (Not losses) and hit the punish button upon seeing \"Teemo wtf don't flash into full health Garen noob\" in chat.\r\n\r\nI've seen a lot of tribunal horror stories before, but you know this qualifies as stupid. If a player can't handle negative feedback on his don't-try-don't-care play style then that should be his own personal problem, and shouldn't be brought to the tribunal for a bunch of unattractive introverts to skim over and punish. Who the hell decides to report someone for verbal harassment anyway? What a pussy, in my 2,000 games of LoL I've never once reported someone because I got my \"feelwings\" hurt.","replies":[{"poster":"Komarimaru","date":"2015-02-11T11:17:19.024+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wait.....

And ya know what?  Don't blame them.  I have bad games too, from my screw ups or someone else ruining it, but I just suck it up and move on.  Because let's be honest here, if that one bad game sticks with you, and you remember it always, you need help.
