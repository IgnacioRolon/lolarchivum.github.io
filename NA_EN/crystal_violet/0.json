One of them was to a very close friend of mine that I know in real life. Fortunately, I changed my password to my league account before anything could happen. Unfortunately, my friend did not. She made her account about four or five years ago, and no longer remembers her email or password to said email that she used to create her league account. She is devastated and I feel super guilty because I am to blame for this whole mess. She has sent several support tickets in. She is afraid that the hacker will use her account and get it permanently banned. \n\nHow long until you can get back to me? Or her? Her account name is currently \"Dekinai\" and she is a diamond 2 player. Is there anything else I or she can do? \n\nhttps://gyazo.com/0f620d051dcae7461db956877b6d90eb This is me when I was hacked and the link was sent to Dekinai. Date and time are listed. \n\nhttps://gyazo.com/e531f2a522d8eb31a78c8442984bfac1 These are the people that are the hacker is currently playing with. The hacker has been playing with these people for the past few games. My friend Dekinai does not recognize any of these names.\n\nThe hacker is currently playing normals with bronze/silver/gold players, leading me to believe that they are elo-boosting or playing with a friend. \n\nThank you so much, anything will help at this point.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-20T04:09:52.440+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sending in several support tickets about the same issue actually makes it harder for us to get back to you. I definitely recommend telling your friend to only submit one in the future. We'll have an account specialist get back to her as soon as possible, but we've had a lot of requests lately, so wait times are longer than normal.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions.","replies":[{"poster":"Crystal Violet","date":"2016-10-21T01:03:09.682+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you so much!
