After having to close my client, I reopened it and the client stated that I had left a game and gave the option to reconnect.  Seeing as I had not joined another game afterwards, this seemed fishy.  I had a friend try to spectate the game while I attempted to reconnect to a nonexistent match.  Nothing loaded other than a black screen.  A friend of mine, who was duoing with me during this match, is also experiencing the exact same problem.  Please help, I don't want to lose any LP!  \r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nBecquerrel\r\n\r\n( screenshot of friend's client: http://puu.sh/rg2fC.jpg )","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-19T17:52:44.843+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This typically happens if the server doesn't properly report the results of the match. These are pretty rare, and we refer to them as a \"Ghost Game\". They shouldn't last longer than a few hours. Unfortunately, due to the nature of these situations, they may not record the LP gain/loss for the match, and in your instance, it sounds like this happened as well. \n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Code Queen","date":"2016-09-19T00:39:43.091+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey I have this problem too.
