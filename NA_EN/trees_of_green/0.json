All my drivers are up to date and I repatched using the Hextech Repair Tool which seemed to have done the trick but my computer is old and inconsistent so I'm afraid it will happen again. Im stuck in bronze 2 and it is all because of my client crashing alot and to add insult to injury I have low priority for the second time for the same reason. when it does finish repairing I am able to see the post game lobby where everyone is mad at me for trolling or something :/\r\n\r\n\r\nThis may not be reasonable but I want there to show the reason of disconnecting in the chat (Player has quit : Game Crash) this way your team wont assume that you just left for no reason and I hope there is a way so that I dont lose LP for crashing. This is just my idea for a new system to be implemented but I doubt it would make it in.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough I may be upset, I do want to thank Riot Support for replying so fast to my ticket and they are currently helping me resolve the issue","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-11T01:36:06.151+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea, that definitely sucks when it feels like the crash is out of your control. It's good that you're hooked up with our tech team in that ticket as they'll be able to look through some logs to figure out exactly what's going wrong. \n\nAnd honestly, I don't think it would entirely impossible to add something like why someone left the game. I'm not one of the devs so I don't really know if it's doable, but I'd suggest posting that over in [**Client Discussion **](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/alpha-client-discussion) to draw more attention to your idea!","replies":[]}]}
