ONE GAME WITH A PLAYER THAT PURPOSELY GAVE UP , ADMITTED TO IT.\n\n2 month of hard work is gone... Really, the funniest shit is that when i talked to support about it\nthey said that it is a &quot;Minor penalty&quot; and will serve as a warning. what part of 2 months did you not understand. i was not toxic for 2 months and getting that work removed is a minor penalty, due to one game. A completely isolated game with a admitted thrower gets you chat restriction\n\nnice system. And the reason was that &quot;I wasnt using the chat system correctly because i was arguing with other players and that takes the focus of the chat system away&quot;\n\n??? So arguing is a punishable offense nice, I would be fine with this punishment if there was more than one game i was even close to toxic. but it was 1 game where i called someone trash one time for throwing, the only other thing that would be remotely discouraging is when i told someone that they should have the game knowledge at plat 2-3 w/e it was that when you see someone from talk walk to river to not facecheck the bush top side right after u see them walk in it.\n\nGame 1\nPre-Game\nBiochemicalZombi: Can someone ban ashe\nBiochemicalZombi: ..\nBiochemicalZombi: they are just going to jump on me\nIn-Game\nBiochemicalZombi: tf first?\nBiochemicalZombi: they might lvl 2 bot watchout\nBiochemicalZombi: drain\nBiochemicalZombi: its beena  min\nBiochemicalZombi: nv\nBiochemicalZombi: no f heal\nBiochemicalZombi: ig\nBiochemicalZombi: bot\nBiochemicalZombi: tf could u roam on that\nBiochemicalZombi: oh just buttfuck top nv\nBiochemicalZombi: dont use E\nBiochemicalZombi: i can freeze\nBiochemicalZombi: shes gonna have f soon\nBiochemicalZombi: panth 6\nBiochemicalZombi: sorry\nBiochemicalZombi: wtf\nBiochemicalZombi: oh\nBiochemicalZombi: wait i thought fid r was upxd\nBiochemicalZombi: tf can bot get some love\nBiochemicalZombi: no heal trist\nBiochemicalZombi: mfw i get ganked before i get ganks\nBiochemicalZombi: ???\nBiochemicalZombi: U JUST WALKING INTO IT AHH\nBiochemicalZombi: WHAT THE FUCK\nBiochemicalZombi: wnna lose?\nBiochemicalZombi: 0/1 to 2/1\nBiochemicalZombi: im\nBiochemicalZombi: about\nBiochemicalZombi: to tilt\nBiochemicalZombi: in what universe do we go for a 1v3\nBiochemicalZombi: please play around me\nBiochemicalZombi: lol\nBiochemicalZombi: no zhonas?\nBiochemicalZombi: god\nBiochemicalZombi: ?????\nBiochemicalZombi: ye\nBiochemicalZombi: ward pls\nBiochemicalZombi: we need camile\nBiochemicalZombi: for teamfihts\nBiochemicalZombi: she gets zed off me\nBiochemicalZombi: regroup\nBiochemicalZombi: god\nBiochemicalZombi: this\nBiochemicalZombi: tf please untilt\nBiochemicalZombi: im done\nBiochemicalZombi: FF\nBiochemicalZombi: FF\nBiochemicalZombi: F\nBiochemicalZombi: AF&quot;\nBiochemicalZombi: as/h\nBiochemicalZombi: trash\nBiochemicalZombi: plat\nBiochemicalZombi: player\nBiochemicalZombi: all i have to say\nBiochemicalZombi: stop getting caught\nBiochemicalZombi: You should have enough game knowledge to realize zed and panth will just 1v1\nBiochemicalZombi: cmon\nBiochemicalZombi: yeah\nBiochemicalZombi: yep\nBiochemicalZombi: we saw swain top\nBiochemicalZombi: walk downwards\nBiochemicalZombi: where did u think he went\nBiochemicalZombi: a portal to narnia?\nBiochemicalZombi: I just get pissed when people play so bad\nBiochemicalZombi: Im telling the truth\nBiochemicalZombi: its game knowledge\nBiochemicalZombi: he walked down i mean\nBiochemicalZombi: if ur ignoring that ur just throwing\nBiochemicalZombi: yeah\nBiochemicalZombi: .\nBiochemicalZombi: We can still win this\nBiochemicalZombi: we have to stop getting caught\nBiochemicalZombi: our comp is much better\nBiochemicalZombi: i dont know why you guys just soft int it\nBiochemicalZombi: play right and its +25 just thinkl\nBiochemicalZombi: ???\nBiochemicalZombi: what is this team\nBiochemicalZombi: ggwp\nBiochemicalZombi: report top\nBiochemicalZombi: mid\nBiochemicalZombi: jg\nBiochemicalZombi: thanks\nPost-Game\nBiochemicalZombi: You have xin and tf\nBiochemicalZombi: constantly camping top\nBiochemicalZombi: your 3/1 what do you do\nBiochemicalZombi: Camile what do you think about this situation\nBiochemicalZombi: &quot;Lets try to 1v1 zed bot&quot;\nBiochemicalZombi: Welp i just got that\nBiochemicalZombi: so hes griefing\n\nThis was the only game.

So how recent is this, is riot a small indie company that cannot keep chat logs for longer than 2 months?\n\n2) I dont flame people for feeding, I tell them \"Hey stop getting caught out\" , If thats flaming then wow. \nIn this instance as i said i called him trash because as he said in game/post game dont remember he said something along the lines of \"I dont even care about winning im just practicing champions.\" \n\nYour wasting my time, the time the game took, and the time it will take to get the progress back. and i cant call him trash. once.\n\n3) Riot should be capable enough to give more than 1 game as a reason for the ban. The reform card is suppose to show you whats not allowed, so how am i suppose to do that when i basically only got one sample of one instance i called someone trash for throwing\n\nDoes this tell me im suppose to just encourage him wasting my time. \n\nTL:DR, Why is it that riot can only give me one instance in a 2month span where i was \"Arguing to much\" To justify a chat restriction... where there was a person throwing\n\nMaybe riots a small indie company who cant keep chat logs longer than 2months. Also i dont act like this in all games even with feeders, only when they intentionally do it.","replies":[{"poster":"Chermorg","date":"2018-06-05T03:19:09.317+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"1. Even one game is too much. Riot will overlook one bad game in a blue moon if that's all you have. But you admit your honor was already low - you've been punished before and returned to this sort of behavior.\n\n2. You may not consider it flaming, but you're constantly belittling others for their poor play and what you see as the wrong decisions. Even when you're **not** flaming them, you're still trying to act like the boss and as if you're the expert - that is not okay. Everyone in League has their autonomy to decide how the game is best won. There is no enforced required meta, there is no required playstyle, build, runes, etc. You have no right to attempt to pressure people to follow your bidding.\n\n3. They certainly can keep chat logs (and do) for longer than a week. However, it does no good to show you age-old chat you won't remember even saying. The goal of the reform card is to give you an *example* of what behavior is not okay - it is not designed to show all of the behavior that you've done is not okay.\n\n---\nAgain, it is not this one instance most likely. Given you said you didn't increase in honor over those 2 months, it's very likely (almost guaranteed) you are behaving poorly in games - even if those games weren't enough to get you punished again. You should not need more than one game - you know this is not allowed, I suspect this is what led to your prior punishment(s), and you still chose to repeat this sort of argumentative and \"I'm better than you\" attitude in game.\n\nAnd by the way, someone playing poorly is not intentionally feeding. Someone not listening to you is not intentionally feeding. Someone making a decision that you disagree with is not intentionally feeding. Maybe they didn't see the 1v3 and thought they'd get a pick.

Not sure why you even said this as i've said i called the player who was **not trying to win** Trash. like he actually said he wasnt trying to win.\n\n3) Even if i don't remember saying anything if i did say, its still examples of whats not ok. Just because i dont remember saying it doesnt mean i cant identifiy if it was wrong... ?????\n\nI Wasn't gaining honor for a long time that i had a suspicion that my account was just permanently honor locked and which i asked support to which they responded\n\"I am happy to provide you with insight on your honor progression! I have good news for you, you have successfully moved your way up to earning honor at a normal pace. I audited your account and you are currently earning honor progress at a normal rate as of 2/18. You are very close to earning your first checkpoint in progression through honor level 0. If you continue to play with a non-toxic attitude and accrue more honor, you are now climbing with a normal progression through our honor system and should get level 1 soon!\n\nI hope this helps! Please let me know if you have any other questions.\" This was on April 2nd 2018, 8:16:02 pm\n\nI mean how was i suspose to know that my account wasn't able to gain honor through FEB-April,\n\nThe fact i have to ask someone to remove the honor lock is enough to show this system is flawed.\n\nSo basically i gained from Honor 0 through 3 checkpoints to Honor 1 1/3 Within a month.\n\nAnd yes someone playing poorly is not intentionally feeding, you know whats intentionally feeding? maybe i forgot to mention but yeah, the guy said he wasn't trying and was practicing new champions. Did i forget to mention this in my thread?\n\nI noticed that throughout your replies you are assuming that the guy i called trash was just playing poorly so let me bold this out for you\n\n**HE CLEARLY STATED HE WAS NOT TRYING IT WAS NOT THAT HE WAS PLAYING BAD, HE ADMITTED TO WASTING MY TEAMS TIME BECAUSE HE WAS NOT TRYING TO WIN THEREFORE UNDER THE REPORT CATEGORY NEGATIVE ATTITUDE - Griefing, Giving up**","replies":[{"poster":"Chermorg","date":"2018-06-05T16:31:51.240+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"It doesn't matter if he broke the rules first, that does not give you the right to flame, harass, or abuse him.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"sleepysithlord","date":"2018-06-05T16:41:37.935+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is basically nothing you can do if someone griefs you in game.
