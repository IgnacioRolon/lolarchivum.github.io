You don't have any remaining refunds left. Each account is given 3 refunds, and once you use them up, that's it. The number of refunds you have remaining will be in the top left when in the Purchase History screen.\n\n2.) You received the champion in a non-refundable way. Currently, you can only refund something you personally purchased with either RP or IP. If you obtained it through Hextech Crafting, a self-bought Mystery Gift, or a gift from someone else, then unfortunately you will be unable to refund it.\n\n3.) You own a skin for the champion. If you own a skin for the champion, then you will need to refund the skin first before refunding the champion.\n\nHopefully this clears things up. Unfortunately, unless reason 3 is the case for you, then I don't think you will be able to refund the champion.\n\nEDIT: There may be other reasons why it would say \"non-refundable\" that I'm forgetting, so if I think of anything else, I will post them here.","replies":[{"poster":"Renevade","date":"2016-10-16T20:10:44.280+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It says I have no more refunds left, is there a way I can get more? or refund it anyway?\n\nI probably haven't used a refund since 2013.","replies":[{"poster":"Zombiemaster","date":"2016-10-16T20:12:45.962+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately, there is no way to get more refunds, and there is currently no other way to refund a purchase.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
