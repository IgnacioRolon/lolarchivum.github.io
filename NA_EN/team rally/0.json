When i tried logging in about 2 days ago it told me that my account was being transferred. I immediately submitted a ticket to riot support, but I also did some digging and here is what I found. Someone got access of my account and has played 2 games since i lost control of my account. I went through my match history by searching my account up online. Also, I believe my account was transferred to EUWest. When I search up my match history online my icon is different and the account is labeled: Tarmi Jebach. The next thing I do is try to recover my password obviously, but that doesnt work because it says I am not in the right region and that my account is transferring. So I try my account name with the region EUWest and it works! However, he changed the email so now I didnt receive the email to change my password. Other then waiting on Riot support is there anything I can do? It seems pretty out of control at this point, but I was hoping maybe someone had been through this before. Any help would be much appreciated!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-24T02:31:57.731+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Eep that's no good!! I've pulled up that account and see that someone else might have been able to hack your account and transfer it. Just so you have a little peace of mind, I've made sure the account is protected and kept safe for now! \n\nYou'll need to talk with our accounts team in your [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to verify yourself as the original creator, and then we'll be able to get your account back and fix any damage. Make sure you choose the option \"I need help recovering my account\" when you make that ticket!","replies":[{"poster":"Team Rally","date":"2017-07-24T03:04:14.988+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You just made my day haha.

I was right someone somehow managed to get a hold of my account and bought a couple skins and then a transfer over to EU Nordic. Pretty crazy stuff haha. Played about 20 games too and messed around with my runes and masteries. I guess i got pretty lucky though, it could of been a lot worse.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ATastyCooki","date":"2017-07-24T01:46:48.310+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"No this is just there way of screwing you over i talked to one of them telling them my account was stolen today giving them its last password and email with pictures of the email before it changed was not enough there just allowing people to do it so they make more money off you hoping you rebuy skins https://postimg.org/image/dqysoakrj/ this is not enough proof someone stole it or this https://postimg.org/image/4brgx0k0f/ the fact i am still logged onto the website its likely them stealing your account .","replies":[{"poster":"Team Rally","date":"2017-07-24T02:30:08.436+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wait so they didn't give back your account, even though you had proof?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-24T03:07:14.030+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wanted to step in just a bit here. Sending screenshots of \"proof\" doesn't help solidify you as the account creator, because anyone could take screenshots if they have access to your account or email. We can absolutely get you back in the game and on the Rift as long as you can remember some key information about your account.","replies":[{"poster":"ATastyCooki","date":"2017-07-24T04:23:02.218+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"So your tell me thats not enough proof with the fact it was changed today and i know it cause i logged on yesterday and almost everyday for months got screenshots and to make it worse they won't even disable the account till the other person can prove its theres so your letting them keep it despite me having proof its obviously mine and your not even going to question them you also never sent me an email the day it was changed so its either your employee or some sort of scam cause i never got an email accept one almost 2 weeks ago .\nMost the info your asking for to is from years ago and things about RP which i never get anymore for this obvious reason .","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ATastyCooki","date":"2017-07-24T02:43:21.090+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"no its not obvious enough that the account is mine","replies":[]}]}]}]}
