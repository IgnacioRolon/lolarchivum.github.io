When your monitor error pops up just at the loading screen or in-game,unplug the VGA cabel!\n2. Wait 4 seconds,then plug it back.\n3. Now you will get a bug splat,press don't send!\n4. Press Reconnect in the client,and BOOM,it's solved AF! {{champion:74}}","replies":[{"poster":"CaptainAHALOOL","date":"2017-08-23T12:10:49.482+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had the same problem...Thx for this nice tip ;D","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rapha13R","date":"2017-01-15T22:46:52.572+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same for me...

I did try to fix mine but it doesn't work for some reason. So I might just wait till next patch and see if it can be fix then. But here's a solution that you can try to see if it works.\n\nplease open C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\\game.cfg with notepad and there you will find:\n\nQuote:\n[General]\nShowTurretRangeIndicators=1\nWindowed=DEPRECATED\nCfgVersion=3.15.260\nSnapCameraOnRespawn=1\nUserSetResolution=1\nBindSysKeys=0\nOSXMouseAcceleration=0\nAutoAcquireTarget=1\nEnableLightFx=0\nWindowMode=0\nPredictMovement=0\nWaitForVerticalSync=1\nColors=32\nHeight=1024         <-----------------\nWidth=1280          <-----------------\nGameMouseSpeed=10\nSystemMouseSpeed=0\n\n\nYou can change the Height and Width to what that yellow text saying something like \"Optimum Resolution\" then it shows the resolution that would best fit your screen. \n\nOr you can just go on youtube and search for help there. Or search online for more help if it doesn't work. Or wait for the admin or others to respond and help you.","replies":[{"poster":"Imacowmoo159","date":"2017-01-15T22:54:14.060+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah i tried changing those to a few different suggested  values and i get the same result every time idk thanks though","replies":[{"poster":"PaladinNO","date":"2017-01-16T15:02:49.679+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did you try changing\n>WindowMode=0\n\nto\n\n>WindowMode=1\n\n?\n\n_This is also what Alt+Enter does, except it stays so permanently._\n\nFor the future, it could also be a default _monitor_ setting that's the problem.\nIf you access your monitor's settings during such a black screen or indeed any other random screen issues, and scroll through the various aspect ratio options, it might be the solution.\n\nI had a similar issue with one of my screens and an pre-widescreen era game. The game crashed on startup every time, no matter what I did with .cfg file or Windows graphics settings. \n\nTurned out the monitor was set to \"Auto\", and not forced to 16:10, like it should. Changed it to always display in 16:10, and problem solved.\n_Game wanted 4:3, so the image was stretched AF (but could be tweaked around), and at least it worked, so I didn't complain._","replies":[]}]}]}]}
