I never get to see start after a game 90% of the time, which really bothers me. \r\n\r\nEven worse is that I am often waiting in que with friends for a game. They will get a game and I wont get the game. I am not disconnected thought because I can still chat, look at the store, and browse my leagues and match history like normal. \r\n\r\nMy internet is really good, I share with 1 person, and it is much more then enough. I live in Chicago, so my ping is usually 17 and  I never have lag or disconnects in game. It just happens before and after almost every game now, and it is quite frustrating.\r\n\r\nI have been looking up for a while how to fix this but no one seems to have the same problem as me, if anyone knows or a Riot employee could attempt to help me, that would really mean a lot. I didn't want to come to the forums, but I can't find anything on my issue.","replies":[{"poster":"Shutori","date":"2017-10-09T12:37:20.577+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bump, it's still shit.

It sounds like a connection issue with your network is causing you to be left behind upon accepting the match.\n\nAdditionally, waiting for the game stats to load can also be due to an unstable connection.\n\nFor these specific issues, I recommend going over our [Troubleshoot Connection](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) issue to get this fixed up.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KaKu I SUMMONYOU","date":"2016-07-15T15:19:14.216+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have the same problem with the \"skip waiting for stats\" part.
