For example Jungler is usually about the toughest role for the system to judge you worthy of that S.  Whereas with Support, you can have lots of games where you feel you didn't do all that great but then at the post game screen it's like \"YOU EARNED AN S  Here's a chest\"  and it's like \"Um ok, I didn't think I did all that great, but I'll take that chest.  Thank you Rito\"\n\nProbably not at the top of the priorities, but it would be nice for this system to get some tweaks later on, or adjust it so that you can also get a chest or two if you consistently get A's with a champ.  Like provided you didn't get a chest with a champ yet and haven't gotten that S, but have gotten about 3 A's then on that third A, you get the chest.\n\nJust an idea or two.","replies":[{"poster":"oSEXYPLATYPUSo","date":"2017-07-30T14:43:06.254+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you can only get one chest per champ per season\n\nyou can earn a chest once per week ( more if you have 4 stored cuz you havent earned in a while )","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Escheton","date":"2017-07-30T03:48:44.201+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unless you are playing support, that score just isn't top 95% material.
