We don't know if you'll be able to purchase both the border and the chroma, only by completing the quests and not buying any separate orbs or chests. Will they be clarified? I don't want to miss this skin and the things that could come with it, so please clarify these things for us!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-20T00:29:13.133+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't believe we've quite released *all* of the info about those missions just yet, but I'm assuming this 'event' will be similar to the recent ones. You'll most likely get enough tokens from free missions to get most of the content, but in order to get ALL of it you may need to buy the \"mission pass\" for this event if there is one.","replies":[{"poster":"Geneman","date":"2017-09-20T01:26:10.820+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I meant that with the pass, but if it'll be enough for the chroma and border then it's alright. I'd only like to know the content of the missions now.","replies":[]}]}]}
