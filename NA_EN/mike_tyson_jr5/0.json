I want to create a disscusion to find out if what im going to say is achievable. So, here it is:  I got perma banned on 7-8 account which I wasted so much time making them lvl 50+, wasted so much money to buy skins or things like that(im playing from season 3 btw) and getting perma banned can be very frustrating. So, the fact is: instead of PERMA BAN, couldn't u make a permanent chat restriction or something like that. Or ban one year maximum. I know some player are very angry and that is their character. Not every1 changes. That perma chat restriction instead of perma ban could be very nice and the best idea i guess for that subject. Something else. I have a very old account where i had so many skins and champs and is lvl 30- (bcs in season 4, 30 was max) Can i get it back somehow? i ll do anything literally. I would like it back cuz its banned from 2015 kind of. I would love to have it back...","replies":[{"poster":"GatekeeperTDS","date":"2019-06-18T16:59:27.402+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"> getting perma banned can be very frustrating\n> I got perma banned on 7-8 account\n\nThis is a **you** problem.\n\n> instead of PERMA BAN, couldn't u make a permanent chat restriction or something like that\n\nThis again?

[Here's a board post talking about it.](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/NbEuvL4O-why-riot-doesnt-do-permanent-chat-bans)\n\n_Riot Wookiecookie:_\n\"The observed behavior of those which were banned was that they used what little chat they had in game to harass and berate others. In other cases they decided to feed or play against their own team in order to \"prove a point.\"\n\n>I have a very old account where i had so many skins and champs and is lvl 30- (bcs in season 4, 30 was max) Can i get it back somehow? i ll do anything literally.

It sucks to lose an account but we're given many chances to reform and ultimately we have no one to blame but ourselves if we get banned.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mike Tyson JR5","date":"2019-06-18T16:56:55.451+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":6,"body":"I gotta say one more thing: Will there be a time when every banned acc will go unbanned? maybe 2020 i dont know something like a gift.? just saying.\nBy the way, after every money invested in YOUR game, we should be able to take it back somehow... even after 1-2-3 years...","replies":[{"poster":"Paletongue","date":"2019-06-18T17:14:15.938+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've never had a single ban or chat restriction, and I've been playing since Season 2. You were warned several times that you will permanently lose your account if you continued raging, and you didn't change your behavior.\n\nIt's too late to change your actions in the past, those accounts are gone.

Either shape up or ship out.

Just think about. I make u rich and u fire me. Why? Because of my behaviour?  Some people never change.. I cant not to get angry even if i mute them. I will always flame where i have to because i cant not to do it. But at the same time i invest money for that. So its like it doesent really matters. Anyway some rules are shitty for example the word K*S. Really now. What if by saying lys i wanna say key safe. They will never know what i want to say. And even so, if I say K*S to some1 u really think they will?no. K*s is like any other curse thst we use. Or get can*er.. U really think if i say get can*er they wil really GET IT? No thats a nope. I know i lost my accounts. That is it. Anyway it is what it is. But when u meet one of their team on the street, they will be in danger i guess. For ebery people banned, some will want to revange..idk","replies":[]}]}
