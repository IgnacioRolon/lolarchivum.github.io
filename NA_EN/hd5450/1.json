When I am in game and try to change the resolution, it doesn't give me the 1920 x 1080 option, the max it will go 1600 x 920. The 1920 x 1080 is simply not in the list when I go into the video tab. Do I need to reinstall league?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-29T20:21:17.203+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This may be caused by a corrupt input file that prevents your native resolution from showing up.
