So when the timer in champion select goes down to zero, a riot icon should appear in the middle and it should show up the player loading screen, but the riot icon didn't show and there was no error message. If i click the riot icon on the bottom right and open up the client, it would say that game is still in progress and show that I am in a game. And if I restart my client, it would tell me to reconnect to the game, but the same thing happen when I try to reconnect and nothing would show up.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-17T22:13:27.863+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"This is great info, thanks!  It sounds like your network can't connect to your game server.  When champion select ends your connection moves over to the game server, but it looks like you're ending up in an idle state instead.   No worries, this can get fixed up by going over the series of steps in our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide.  This should get you back in without issue, but let me know if the problem persists.","replies":[{"poster":"HD5450","date":"2016-08-17T23:56:53.235+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi, I really appreciate the help, I run the hextech tool and configuring the IP and now I can play the game again.

But hey, I'm an oceanic player, blah blah. No support page for the oceanic community still. been forever, blah blah. How do I solve this issue. Can I just download it from idk, the NA tech support place. Or will it not work, because I tried that. Doesn't seem to work. \"Loading\" doesn't do anything beyond that. No not impatient. Why do you think I'm here. You know. \n. . \nStill here asking for help. . . for OVER A YEAR.\n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}} \n\nOh and btw. \"Coming Soon\" for Oceanic player support. . .  that's been \"Coming Soon\" for I guess over a year now. probs heaps longer.
