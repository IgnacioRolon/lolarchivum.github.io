We're working on a fix still, leaving a champion disabled for a significant period of time is something we do our best to avoid, so if it's practical to we hotfix for disables. The exception to that is we know the fix has a high risk of breaking other things we avoid hotfixing and put the fix through a full testing cycle (e.g. if modifying code that affects a number of other game elements too, which is what lead to Viktor/Rumble being disabled for an extended period).","replies":[{"poster":"Mansana","date":"2015-06-14T06:24:21.297+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So there are some bugs that still exist in the game but the fact that they could break something means you'd rather go through a full development cycle than hotfix it.
