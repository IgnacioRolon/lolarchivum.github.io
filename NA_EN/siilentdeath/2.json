This shouldn't be that bad due to the fact that I as a Plat 2 Ekko OTP gets autofilled as support then guess what my team is SOL because of Autofill. Autofill would be a fine add on for someone who is on all around player, but me as a mid laner especially as an OTP would benefit my team if I was in my main position. I might better almost Diamond Level Ekko Mid Laner, but I am not in other positions so why put me there.","replies":[{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2018-11-07T18:40:10.784+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For you, the new Ranked system will be helpful, since you'll have a separate rank for Mid than you would have on the other roles.
