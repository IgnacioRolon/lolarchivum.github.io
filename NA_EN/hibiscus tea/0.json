It happens frequently in game, but I&#039;m not sure how to record it.  While I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s really a bug, or maybe a glitch, I figured I should report it you nonetheless, b/c I found it to be a little bothersome; I enjoy listening to the champions speak when I play them, especially when they have a voice I enjoy a lot.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2018-03-29T05:44:27.701+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the report!
