If Rito makes BKB for Lol melee ADC and smash keyboard champions like Katarina will become pretty much god tier and pros will play comps like protect the Master Yi vs protect the Katarina or something, because they  will shit on ranged without being kited, stunned, rooted, slowed etc. \nNow you can't teamfight good with Yi or Trynda.

Teemo is great at split pushing, and annoyingly kite and dot in lane, but other than objective control and kiting from a losing team fight w/ his shrooms, his kit is limited to blind and burst on one opponent in team fight, and then hoping his low range AA don't get him caught and blown up while he is sticking around for team fight and not able to kite through his shrooms unless team works w/ that as a poke comp.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Squarefighter","date":"2015-06-10T19:31:01.314+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Quality post.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Stardew VaIIey","date":"2015-06-10T19:22:06.097+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:17}} \nAnd he can't farm, so he can't buy stuff, he can't push because of shrooms, he can't run away because of shrooms. you just have to auto him when he ults, the poison wil kill him.\nAnd you can spam the laugh.","replies":[]}]}
