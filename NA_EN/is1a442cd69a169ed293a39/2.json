No problem! You can revenge by spreading hatred towards the champion!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHere are the materials you need:\n\n1.  League of Legends Wiki\n2.  A Computer with a Keyboard\n3. Internet Access\n4.  An Account on Official LoL Forum\n\nGot every thing ready? Good! Now, there are few steps to effectively convince Riot that that champion is OP,\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFirst, search for that champion on Wiki, and then read all of the skill descriptions. Prepare to recite them to create a thread.\n\n1. Remember to list every single effect on every skill. Otherwise, it sounds less OP.\n2. Try to finish your description in one sentence with one period, it sounds more OP.\n3. Be aware that most people on boards can&#039;t read. You should paraphrase the description with the following useful keywords:\n**Permanent**\n  -Anything that stays forever is OP, because you know, it costs nothing.\n**Massive**\n -If the skill does something massive, it should be nerfed. How would it be called massive if it wasn&#039;t OP?\n**Free**\n -Passives are mostly OP because they are free.\n**Overloaded Kit**\n -If a champion has more than 4 skills, it is very likely to be OP.\n**Winrate and Pickrate mean nothing**\n -How can written plain data be more accurate than first person experience?\n**Free elo**\n -What&#039;s more OP than an instant-win champion?\n**No counterplay**\nYou can't counter something uncountable.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSounds complicated? No worry! I will show you how with Ryze, who has a 40% winrate, as an example.\n\nRyze, are you serious? He&#039;s so damn OP right now. Let&#039;s take a look at his overloaded kit.\nHe gets a free shield that blocks massive damage, a 900 range 4CD spell with a massive hitbox, a 1.75 seconds point and click snare with no counterplay at all, a spell that shreds 36% MR and can bounces to the same target to a total of three massive hits, oh I forget to mention that QWE all scale off both AP and Mana dealing massive damage, and HIS ULTIMATE THAT PERMANENTLY REDUCES HIS CD BY 30% gains him 25% spell vamp and massive movement speed, and top it up by making all his spells AOE.\n\nI don&#039;t understand why he is still not nerfed yet. His 40% winrate is capped by his high skill floor and ceils, but it doesn&#039;t mean it can be broken. Time to stop this free elo.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSecond, comments should arrive soon. \n\nBefore you get downvoted by noobs who don&#039;t understand the game, try to shut their mouths with these useful phrases:\n\n1. You are bronze/silver/gold. What do you know?\n2. Here comes a Ryze main. It&#039;s funny how these mains are trying to protect their free elo.\n3. Judging from your match history, you have never played as him before. What do you know?\n\nNow you know what to do! Thanks for reading! I hope your targets get nerfed as soon as possible!","replies":[{"poster":"SerBlaise","date":"2015-05-28T19:44:32.240+0000","up_votes":29,"down_votes":2,"body":"I almost always downvote QQ threads.

His passive just doesn't fit an ADC, and it doesn't even do much because you have to build it up over time. Graves has terrible range for an ADC so you have to be closer to the frontline. Why would you ever take the frontline as the ADC? His W is basically a small AOE slow that you can walk out of. His E would be... Oh, Tristana has a better dash, a better steroid, and what's this? More range? I don't believe this! As for his attack speed, his base attack speed and AS/Level are both weak. I mean, let's look at Kennen.

Considering your team just has to come up and would in that case, whack them a few times and you would instantly win every game.\n\nAnd I agree with you, many champions that aren't played in the LCS could be overpowered and freelo. Tryndamere for example, I'm quite surprised this guy isn't really played in pro matches since he lacks a lot of counterplay ability.
