And I know that i speak for a good majority of the community when i ask this.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-24T00:39:42.930+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Connection speed itself isn't actually a huge factor that League relies on. League relies more on a **stable** or **consistent connection**, as there are 9 other players whose actions' must be synced with you and the game servers to ensure everything works properly. It's a lot more complicated than that, but that's my best breakdown of the matter.\n\nThere are steps that every player can take in order to ensure their connection is as **stable** as possible and is less likely to conflict with League. This would be working through our [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues), which has been an extremely useful tool in sorting out unstable connections to our servers.\n\nIf you have any other questions, please let me know.","replies":[]}]}
