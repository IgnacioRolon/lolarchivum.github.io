It was a group of people in my highschool game design class that showed it to me during a demonstration exercise in class. They were using it as an example of a good game in design and quality. Intrigued by the presentation, I asked the group where I could get the game, and they told me it was a free download. Not knowing how to play the game, I asked if I could join their group to learn from them, and they allowed it. I barely knew their names, but after a few months, we were all on Skype almost every night playing a few rounds on Summoner's Rift. Over the years, this game has taught me many things about game design and philosophy that I try and pass on to other people. It's even helped me make a great handful of friends in the last three years at cons, Worlds screening parties and at school. But even in that span of time and among those achievements that, in all honesty have changed my life for the better, I've never met a Rioter on the Fields of Justice. After all that the Riot team has done for us, it almost felt like it'd be a privilege to play with one of them. I know and understand that they're ordinary people like us, only with cooler jobs, but as an aspiring artist and someone who wants to get into game design, I idolize the Riot team.\r\n\r\nAny and all Rioter's out there, I more than understand if you're too busy to accept this request, but if by chance you do: I only ask for one game, playing with you as my favorite mid lane champion, {{champion:1}} . You can play anything you'd like. AP Caitlin mid or even take my mid lane for all I care. I'd happily pick another lane, I just would like to have a fun game with one of you.\r\n\r\nWin or lose, I won't hassle you for another game unless you're willing, but as it stands, I'm at 999 according to my Summoner profile and it would be an honor to fight the 100th with you, please do consider it.\r\n\r\nWith regards from some sappy summoner from California\r\n-Barennoso","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2014-11-11T22:43:31.276+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"Captain Khaos on duty!
