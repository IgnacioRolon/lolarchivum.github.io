Cait can be blocked by someone else, Diana has to be close and even fed a lot of time if she doesn't land the Q to make it recast-able, it's not that strong, Yas is requires SOMETHING to knock you up. And Garen is the easiest champ in LoL and should be deleted. Lmao.\nPoint is MOST ults that can't be dodged don't guarantee you a kill. Trundle doesn't confirm a kill, you just run away. Syndra and Veigar both have delete button ults but can be timed with Hourglass to miss. Nocturne is tricky but also can be hourglassed or you just move to a bush/somewhere he can't see you during his ult. Camille is the closest thing IMO to a busted ult that just wins. However, at least with hers I think (I could be wrong honestly because I don't play her) but I THINK, others can still damage her while she traps someone. If so, hers isn't even that bad. With Mord...he wins. Unless he's braindead and grabs someone FAR stronger than him..he just wins.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TheCheekySneak","date":"2019-06-25T09:31:14.290+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Any champ with a move that lets them become untargetable for a period of time can actually dodge the ult. \n\nThat list includes:{{champion:164}} {{champion:60}} {{champion:28}} {{champion:245}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:141}} {{champion:57}} {{champion:8}} {{champion:498}} \n\nThen there are champs which temporarily blink out of the game altogether with specific moves like:{{champion:35}} {{champion:11}} {{champion:238}} {{champion:421}} \n\nChamps with with on demand spellshields:{{champion:25}} {{champion:56}} {{champion:15}} \n\nAnd of course {{champion:41}} who can eat an orange and escape as well as {{champion:114}} who can riposte it.\n\nOther than that zhonyas can buy you some time, qss lets you escape, and even without either there are options to evade him in the zone.
