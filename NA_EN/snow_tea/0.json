League gains/loses players at a rate that is either not worth reporting (1% increases is nothing to boast about), is equal or basically even or a decline. However, that's not \"dying\". That's just hitting your peak. WoW had the same scenario in 2008-2009 when it peaked with Wrath. That game is still around today with about half as many subs as it used to have.  Hell, check out DoTA2. The game has an average of just over 600,000 players on Steamcharts and it only just broke 13 million unique logins in the last month. It's extremely unlikely it'll ever get higher. \n\nOn the topic of DQ: Guess what, it's probably fine for most people. Can there be less ranked players? Sure, but your average player honestly doesn't give a damn. They don't have a dog in this fight. Readding solo queue won't do much other than maybe make some people stop complaining about it. (Hell, if anything it probably brought more players in despite a drop in ranked play because you can get roles you specifically want in norms.)\n\nQueue times are also not the real problem here because you're selecting by role. It's MUCH easier to get people into a game when there are 5 randoms all fighting for who gets to be mid than it is for finding 2 people to fill this and that role specifically. Remember team builder? Same exact issue with queue times. Only instead of going through champ select you looked through each character to figure out what you wanted to put up with.\n\nTwitch is incorrect as well. There are less overall viewers because there's more overall to watch. There's also an increase in vods and like triple the amount of games. 200k viewers for 4 games vs. 120k viewers for 12 games.  Also streamers/players saying they'll quit is nothing new.\n\nYou're also comparing incredibly broad and generic claims. \"Many players\" \"Lots of people\" etc. The only real proof is that there hasn't been any player statistics posted since 2014 or so and the whole PC Bang thing. For all we know, maybe us 100 people are the last people playing ever. Maybe the rumors of death are greatly exaggerated. \n\nFinally: You can't save a game when it's in decline. You can triage and you can entice new players/bring old ones back (Which will happen whenever Riot has a new champ, the new client or a game mode) but you're not going to \"save\" the game. League peaked and Riot can basically do whatever they want. They're not going to magically save the game and make it more popular than it ever was before.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Arctic Snow Wolf","date":"2016-07-22T21:07:10.985+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":2,"body":"yeah, league is loosing alot of players. everything is just getting over powered, riot is just making everyone stronger and not trying to balance champions this season at all. i know alot of support players are leaving the game the only reason i havent left yet is im part of a team and i made a commitment.

But it's not only the veterans that feel somewhat irked by riot now. New players also have a hard time.\n\n\nFor new players: \n\n1. Really bad tutorials, that really don't teach much. Pretty much either have to make copious amounts of mistakes to learn anything, or go to outside resources, unless ur lucky to have a friend to teach you stuff. \n2. Toxicity: This is a huge problem, with them running into smurfs, smurfs can ruin and crush a new players hope so much that it's just sad. They may feel so defeated and get a horrible opinion of the game. I remember doing a smurf once, man I felt really bad after going like 42 something with galio, somebody who I suck with. I realized that can really defeat people. \n3. Bot accounts, they may run into this and that isn't fair.\n4. The IP costs can still be a huge pain in getting champs they want. Pile that on with rune pages and t3 runes, yeah it sucks. \n\nFor veterans:\n1. Dynamic Que (for some), I personally prefered solo que, as I NEVER made the reason of why i lost was \"oh they had the better premade/better communication\". Now I can make that excuse if I lose horribly lol. And I don't like playing with teams of 4, and sometimes a premade of 3. Hate it. Ranked integrity/ladder compromised. \n2. No new maps. seriously wtf we need a new map\n3. Balancing: Hly shit the balancing at times is awful\n4. Favoritism with certain champs, and others left in the dust, severely outdated.\n5. Age of the game, honestly it hasn't aged that well as we wanted it to be sadly.\n\nOutside competition\nThere's many many other reasons, like Overwatch, P Go, and others. \n\nLCS is boring now.

If I wanted something like League that isn't League I'd probably be on DotA or HotS or something.  When I'm in the mood to play something I play League and really its just to experience the characters I love and to play with friends.  The game environment itself is kind of shit - gold swings like crazy, everyone has tons of damage and there really isn't such a thing as counterbuilding anymore.  If you're counterpicked you're pretty much forced to crutch on your team.  I'm hanging around and keeping fresh in hopes that S7 is better though Riot is always a mixed bag.

Dynamic Q is frustrating and the game sometimes only revolve around who has the better 3-man premade. I don't want to play with friends all the time, I like playing solo and ranking is so much harder this season for that reason. I have improved a lot since the past season but my rank is lower and so many games just feel unwinnable and unfair not because the enemy team is better but because their communication is.\n\n\n* Towers are absolute garbage, they are just wards with a lot of HP , when you get ganked by a well coordinated premade team it doesn't matter if you are under-tower they will still kill you easily. And don't get me started on t3/t4 towers they are suppose to protect the most important objectives in the game and do zero dmg in the late game.\n\n\n* The new player experience is terrible, if you don't have any experience playing MOBAs you are pretty much screwed, there is no clear guideline on what to build and why, how to CS effectively, how to kite , why objectives are important, how to clear the jungle. You pretty much have to research everything by yourself and it take so much time.\n\n* Some champions in this game feel extremely old, outdated and underpowered. They need a rework but instead RIOT keeps creating new champions and completely disregard veterans who have put hours learning these old champs.\n\nThese are just a couple ideas I had on top of my head but im sure there is more !","replies":[]},{"poster":"Elewd","date":"2016-07-23T05:44:05.442+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"i didnt even know dynamic queue existed until i visited the forums, theres literally no difference to most players compared to solo queue and dynamic queue.","replies":[{"poster":"Sevixys","date":"2016-07-23T17:39:11.304+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This. \n\n* _**Before,** it was 2-2-1 vs 2-2-1 - now the worst that can happen is 4-1 vs 4-1._ \n - For an average player, there is no huge difference for the so called _'solo queue'_\n\n(I very seldom end up on the same team with a 4-premade)","replies":[]}]}]}
