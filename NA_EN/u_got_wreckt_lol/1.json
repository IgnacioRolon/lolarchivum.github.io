When is this company going to actually admit, for once in the life of the company, that they actually made a mistake and ruined this game with stopwatches. As if it wasn&#039;t enough that we&#039;ve had 3 years of stale tank meta, then they add in some fucking plants like that&#039;s going to save the game, and lastly they decide &quot;hey, fuck assassins even more let&#039;s give everyone a free 2900g ability since it is the most broken active in the game.&quot; Please do the right thing, remove stopwatch or change the statis to like 1 second while unusable before 15mins.","replies":[]}
