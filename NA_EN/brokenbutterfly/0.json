I played my first games and fell in love with it. People always think it's hilarious when I talk about how the first character released after I started playing was Poppy. I've gotten thousands and thousands of hours of enjoyment out of this game, but, without fail, every single season you've made this game worse and worse and worse. You've killed every character that was original and fun to play. Now we're stuck with 6 champs with a dozen different character models and particle effects. \r\n\r\nMy very first main was TF, you know, back when he had global presence from level 4 and took skill to lock a gold card and win your team the game; back when individual contribution actual MATTERED. But yeah, you killed him hard and fast. \r\n\r\nI fell in love with GP, his crazy magic damage parrrlay mechanics opened the door for theory crafting and experimentation to find the optimal builds. The rng of crit and ults and the elusiveness of oranges the only thing keeping him from sure death were all wonderful mechanics. But you couldn't leave him alone either. I won't be surprised when you remove crit entirely from the game; you made it very clear that any mechanic that relied on luck was out the door.\r\n\r\nI could go on and on, but I\"m gonna keep this somewhat short and kinda alphabetical: \r\nTryn=bullshit rage mechanics as well as the crit nerf.\r\nCass=I don't have to explain this one at all.\r\nEve=was amazing and balanced before rework, now dead.\r\nFiddlesticks=dark wind rework took the fun out of that.\r\nGragas=what were you even thinking with those changes?\r\nHeimer=another unique champ you had to kill because . . . I have no idea\r\nJax=I'm not asking for beta jax, but removing dodge was a bitch move.\r\nKarma=1000 times better before rework\r\nMiss Fortune=ninja patching the ad scaling from her ult was a bitch move\r\nNid=not dead, but not nearly as much fun/good\r\nPantheon=hopefully no explanation needed for anyone who's been around long enough to remember his launch status.\r\nRyze=victim of the meta as much as the nerf bat\r\nSoraka=we all know this one\r\nTwitch=survived the stealth rework somewhat better than eve\r\nUrgot=poor dude, didn't even get two months before you killed him (aha, get it?)\r\n\r\nLook at all those . . . those are pretty bad, but the last three you've done have finally put the nail in the coffin.\r\nZiggs=too many nerfs finally caught up with him. He can still do well if you outplay your opponent, but my all-time favorite hero ever is but a shadow of himself.\r\nSion=I've played ap sion from basically the beginning of your damn game . . . yeah thanks for that.\r\n\r\nand finally = ap tristana\r\nofficially dead thanks to an inept design team. The one and only character I still got great joy from playing. Great zoning from explosive shot and the active wrecked any lifesteal (loved solo top against vlad/nasus/swain) and, once you get fed, that wombo combo jump and ult to insta-wreck the adc and jump out the other side of the fight before they knew what had happened. \r\n\r\nI stopped playing at first because I was reluctant to let that last glorious ap trist match slip out of my history, but then I realized that there was just no one left I want to play. I look down my extensive list of champs and realize that there's no more fun for me here. Every season the community grows more toxic and less willing to let me play roles I've been playing for six years. Blitz mid? I must be a fuckin' noob. Something other than adc bot? Guaranteed I'm going to feed. Well, I'm fed up with explaining myself. I've watched the mechanics and the meta evolve and I see no future for this game. It dominates right now, but it's riding on past success. One day there will be a new up and comer and LoL will be abandoned faster than AoS. \r\n\r\nI know we're not supposed to just make QQ threads on the forums, and maybe it makes me a terrible, entitled juvenile for wanting to think my years of staying with this game and hundreds of dollars invested actually mean something, but I'm still going to leave this here in the hope that some Red will read it and maybe remember some of the same things I do. Will it change anything that'll happen in the future? Probably not, and I accept that, but it just didn't feel right to quit without saying a word to the community that took me through the better part of high school as well as college. \r\n\r\nSo long, all.","replies":[{"poster":"Tusutaki","date":"2015-01-31T03:48:37.070+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im sorry but whats so bad about the Soraka rework again?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Drakzul","date":"2015-01-31T04:06:35.171+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok. \nNidalee rework bad? LOL. Now she is actually thematic and does something unique. Her rework MADE her fun. Before the rework you just spammed spears and hopefully hit someone for an insane amount of damage. But that was it. Throw skillshot. Run away and then throw another. MAYBE go cougar form and engage once or twice a game. It was miserable to play as and against. I remember all the people playing nidalee complaining about how boring she was, but playing her because of how bullshit she was. Then they reworked her.\nAnd holy shit. She is SO MUCH FUN. You feel like a hunting cat. Your cougar form is VERY useful and you have so much more play making ability with the hunt mechanic and pounce resets. In my opinion she is one of the better reworks that Riot has ever done. \n\nSion Rework.... He's an actual champion now. Now longer the trolly bullshit that AP Sion was. He has actual counterplay and he takes a brain to play. Not throw stun and run up to champion. If you don't feel like a motherfreakin badass when you play Sion then something is seriously wrong with ya. Thematically he makes sense and is exactly what you would expect from a giant undead tank terminator. AND he's viable. \n\nGragas also makes more sense now. He's a fat drunk bastard. Why is he running away from the fight? Pre rework he was a mess. His damage was overloaded onto his q and r. You could 100-0 almost everyone with just the 2 abilities. Now you have to actually use all his abilities and play him. Not to mention being up in front of someones face smashing kegs over their heads makes more sense for this lovable drunken hick.\n\nTLDR~ OP is following the rework hate train and being nostalgic. Things change and these changes are good. If you don't want to play then don't play.","replies":[]},{"poster":"IAintDarius","date":"2015-01-31T01:56:18.120+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"tl;dr mad cuz game changes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dryditch","date":"2015-01-31T02:35:09.914+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"AP trist is stronger than ever.\n\nThat E plus W combo will likely 100-0 someone with 1 point in both skills.
