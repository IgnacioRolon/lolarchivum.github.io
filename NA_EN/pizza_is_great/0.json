Can I put a support ticket in for this?\r\nSomeone please help me out, I could have just bought an Epic Skin instead of these rune pages if I knew it was going to screw me out of one.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-11-08T21:57:10.447+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The skin is not a shard, so it would automatically unlock on your account and show up on your purchase history.
