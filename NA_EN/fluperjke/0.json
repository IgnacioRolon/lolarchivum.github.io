I created a ticket and did everything they told me to do ( I disabled teredo , disabled ipv6 and switched to public DNS. I even called my internet provider to see if they had any kind of problem, but nothing... )  So here I am with up to 150 ms (before it was like 70 max ) without any help. I live in Georgia and when I asked my friend (who also lives in my town )if he had a little bit more lag than usual,he responded positively. So I am not sure what happened but I would appreciate any kind of suggestions and help from you my friends. Thanks a lot in advance :)","replies":[{"poster":"Mouthianell","date":"2018-02-09T22:17:58.614+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In Arlington TX, was getting a steady 35 ms ping and 0 - .1% packet loss before a coulpe weeks ago (spectrum internet wired connection)\n\nNow every game i play has results like this\n\nAvg Latency\t52.66 ms\nAvg Packet Loss\t4.64%\nAvg Jitter\t12.31 ms\n\nHuge packet loss spikes and ping fluctuation","replies":[]},{"poster":"Viscarious","date":"2018-02-09T01:17:27.484+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you on ethernet or wifi? Also, have you checked lagreport.com to see if there have been any recent changes in the quality of your connection? Packet-loss will cause the ping shown in-game to spike, so that's the first place I'd look.","replies":[]},{"poster":"THEBlGPP","date":"2018-01-30T04:00:56.282+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm having similar issues as well.
