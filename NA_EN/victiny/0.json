I noticed in the first like 2 or 3 minutes when i got my camera locked on my champion and click the mouse to go back and forth or diagonal pivoting, i could clearly see some fps issues on my screen like fps drops but there weren't any actual fps drops shown on the fps counter in-game. Yesterday it was running perfectly fine but now it has that small fps drops whenever i click back and forth etc. Unlocked camera is fine, didn't do any other updates on my PC apart from League Of Legends. Didn't change anything at all regarding Settings. Need help ASAP. Thanks :3","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-22T17:39:57.471+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There could be an issue with your config that's not responding to your camera settings properly.  As a first step, try resetting your config to see if that helps.\n\nLog into the game client.\nNavigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\nDelete the file  named **game.cfg** and **persistedsettings.json**\nGo into a custom game and verify that settings have saved properly.  Leave game to sync settings. \n\nLet me know if this works for you.","replies":[{"poster":"Victiny","date":"2017-03-22T17:53:40.394+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"nope didnt work whatsoever","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-22T18:01:13.488+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bummer, but thanks for trying!
