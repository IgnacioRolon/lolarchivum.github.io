Hitting a large monster with this effect will restore 25% of your missing mana.\n> **\n> \n> Runic's passive is decent enough for clearing jungle - but it's clearly inferior to Luden vs champions. The extra stats (+ 10 ability power, + 300 mana, + 10% CD and 40 higher splash damage) - clearly justifies the higher cost.\n\nFor malphite R. Or any junglers your using.

Cassio is a really good pick because she also has innate sustain. Whenever malphite walks in to Q, you can drop miasma and start melting him. As Diana, you can just let your shield do the work, maybe itemize defensively, but DEFINITELY ROAM if you want a lead in this matchup. As Veigar, your job here is to stack, and I am sure Malphite is not the only champion that will try to poke you out of lane early game, so treat it like that. Kogmaw? Well hes not really meta in the mid lane so that's your call. xD","replies":[{"poster":"Acemaster81","date":"2019-09-18T00:39:20.476+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I play Kog as adc, but I know he can be played in mid.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Shmeizer","date":"2019-09-17T17:48:07.351+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is AP Malphite meta now, god i hope not hes been my secret troll pick that actually works for like the past 4 years.

Since I noticed you said you play Diana into him.\n\nIn that match-up, I highly recommend you go: electrocute, taste of blood, eye hunter or something like that and either the rune that gives extra life steal/spell vamp or the one that gives movement speed.\n\nFor second tree you have 2 options in 2 trees. \nEither sorcery with magic shield and gathering storm, or gathering storm and perfect focus.\nor in the special tree.\nstopwatch + biscuits. Or boots + biscuits.\n\nYou take tp, and whenever malphite qs you in lane, you q him back to heal from taste of blood.\nyour first item rush is the one that {{item:3010}} and then you build into roa.\n\nAp malphite is a very cheese pick that drops like a rock post 20 mins unless feed. And even then....\nSo, your main goal in lane is to stay healthy with the help of taste of blood, your shield and telesport.\n\nAfter your roa, if malphite isn't ahead you can  1v1 him. If he is 1-3 kills ahead, you have to wait a bit for your roa to stack (like 5-6) mins.\nthen you build normal items like boots, zhonias, rabadons, etc. Whatever you need for that game\n\nOverall the match-up 1v1 is quite easy for Diana. It only becomes a problem when you're camped by the enemy jungler.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Worldlover12","date":"2019-09-17T13:57:22.478+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Acemaster81,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=qUPrLF43,comment-id=,timestamp=2019-09-17T01:44:40.451+0000)\n>\n> I am finding AP Malphite to be extremely frustrating to lane against.

At the dame time, W allows you to clean the wave faster than him. If he tries to contest your push, you should outrade him with you CC. Rush abysal mask and then go tank or semi AP build. You should be ok to make him useless, while you can still provide much more utility than him.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lazy Grandpa","date":"2019-09-17T13:05:58.866+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if malphite maxes Q you can out sustain naturally(in kit) or buy like a rejuvenation bead or 2 and laugh as your health bar fills up in the span of 30 seconds, whilst his mana bar goes down\nif he doesn't max Q then aslong as you're not an auto attack reliant champion then you should be able to out trade him easily, malphite doesnt really like long trades (malph Q E W is also half his manabar). \n\nif you have long range abilities you can in theory permanently stop him from getting his passive shield (x3 armor i believe?)\nif you are a champion that builds health early he shouldn't be able to oneshot unless fed.\nmalphite is not a champion with his ult down until he has Q maxed with atleast ludens and other ap compenents or magic pen.\ndon't gank an ap malphite as a glasscannon squishy assassin, squishy adc or enchanter past lvl 7-8 if he maxed Q \nhave any ability to negates damage or makes you untargetable. \ndont stand on top of your minions or else they all die if he wants to go in with ult and E, but stay near them, if he's ap he's actually squishy so your minions can be a big help\n\n\ni think these should be a couple decent things to keep in mind.\n\nin any case aslong as you don't feed malphite kills, you should be ok. if he's far behind then he's only an ult bot. unfortunately though mage itemization is broken so squishies are never safe.","replies":[]}]}
