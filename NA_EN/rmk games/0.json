I had a problem with League which crashed when a game was loading, and thats why I got the peneltie. I think i don't deserve this because it was not my fault League crashed, and I think it should be removed. (because it was not my fault). I hope Riot understands this because waiting 20 minutes for a game just ruines it for me.","replies":[{"poster":"the Anarchit3cht","date":"2016-12-22T21:33:31.582+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just as a piece of advice, if you notice you are having connection issues, you should stop queuing up for games and work on getting those issues resolves before re-queuing","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-22T18:55:04.851+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The [leaverbuster](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ) system will treat all leaves the same even if it is not intentional, because they all cause others negative experiences.
