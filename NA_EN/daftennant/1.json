As the enemy team rotated to catch me, I E&#039;d back towards tribush. As I was flying over Gromp wall, I noticed Janna and Fiora were on my butt, so I sent a Q flying back at them, which exploded quickly and caught them in a stun to secure my escape, but for the rest of my flight to tribush, Aurelion Sol was facing perpendicular to the flight direction and sort of jittering back and forth like he was having a seizure.\r\n\r\nThis may just be a packet loss error as I was playing with about 400 ping at the time, but I have no way to check without some kind of sandbox mode (*cough cough* rito pls *cough cough*), so I thought it best to report.","replies":[]}
