I successfully hook a level 1 Sivir into my Ezreal, exhaust, and that&#039;s the first blood. I am the sole help for both dragons that fall, I bait Sivir shields with my hook then flash E on her all game to keep my Ezreal fed, I regularly roam mid between kills and secure picks off there, and I finish the game with literally the BEST POSSIBLE SCORE a support can have, and how do I get rewarded? A freaking B+.\r\n\r\n Someone, please tell me if you know because I am at a loss: what the hell else was I supposed to do?","replies":[{"poster":"DREADN0UGHT","date":"2016-04-28T22:39:56.153+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll admit your score is pretty neat, and it looks like you and Ez carried this one hard.\n\nThe grading system, from what I've heard, is based on multiple factors:\n\n* KDA\n* Wards placed\n* Wards destroyed\n* Damage dealt\n* Damage taken\n* Total Farm\n* Objectives killed/assisted\n\nKeeping this in mind, I would say you did very well with your KDA, and maybe objectives by your words, but can't say much for the rest.\n\nEdit: and it also compares with other people from your MMR that play the champ.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sukishoo","date":"2016-04-28T22:06:46.829+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"KDA, CS, Ward placing/destroying, Objectives (towers/inhibs, drag, baron), the skill of the champion played, all of these things are taken into account.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JayHog1992","date":"2016-04-28T21:46:05.003+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did you remember to pink ward?

There's also the question of how much damage did you soak up, the wards placed etc... Lastly getting an S in short games is typically fairly difficult. I heard the calculations also takes into account the opposing team's champion mastery, but I have yet to see confirmation of that.","replies":[{"poster":"DafTennant","date":"2016-04-28T21:30:38.649+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/2172504643/204643871?tab=stats\n\nOk, so I admittedly could have soaked more damage I guess? Wards placed is nearly 1/minute though. Also Ezreal got an S-, and, no offense intended, but I do doubt that the way to earn an S is to stand in the way of more skillshots (which is the major source of damage from the enemy botlane)","replies":[{"poster":"Zerolera","date":"2016-04-28T21:43:34.091+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not standing in front of damage by the AD took nearly as much as you did. Also your participation for your team's kills was less than 50%. I understand it's hard to participate in more of them which is why quick games are harder to get a higher grade in. Also there is a level of difficulty associated with champions so Blitz pulls may just not be seen as the most difficult mechanic to pull off.","replies":[{"poster":"DafTennant","date":"2016-04-28T21:51:04.449+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, plus there were a few kills where I was surprised that I didn't get an assist on them, like when there was a 4-man gank bot and I successfully saved both mine and Ezreal's lives by ulting on at least 3 of them and Ez killed the 4th whom I guess didn't get hit by my ult even though it looked like she did. \n\nThanks for your help, by the way, I really appreciate it :)","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Wulf Helhammer","date":"2016-04-28T21:26:53.750+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A lot of people play Blitz support.

For instance, Dyrus recently posted a video of him playing tank Nami top, and he didn't do the greatest, but still got an S- because *nobody* plays Nami top","replies":[{"poster":"DafTennant","date":"2016-04-28T21:40:24.947+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hmm... so what you're saying is I should play Blitz jungle? {{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Helmight","date":"2016-04-28T21:35:17.060+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It compares your score to the average score of everyone playing that champ in that position.

Taric 4/6/29   kill participation 59% ... I get the S often... (not recently since my epic lose streak happened)  But I found that having half or more kill participation ( I don't roam often at all)  gets you a good grade. This game might be too short for it. If you had 2 kills even you probably would have the S. My most common S happens on Nami and Taric apparently. I never have any chests available anymore. and like 4 keys XD","replies":[]},{"poster":"hsumis1ove","date":"2016-04-28T22:43:39.122+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well you had no kills and no cs.
