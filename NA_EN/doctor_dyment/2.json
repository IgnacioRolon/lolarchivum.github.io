If you don&#039;t like it, please just go without a word. ANYWAY, unto the topic at hand.\n\nKing of Clubs Mordekaiser is a visually fantastic skin. He looks stunning (to me.) His coloring is perfect, his mace is amazing, and that fucking cape makes all the other Mordekaiser skins pale in comparison. Riot, I want you to give the man (or women) who thought of and made this skin a reality a raise. Because god damn, it is just great. And for 750 RP too? You just had to make it even better didn&#039;t you?","replies":[{"poster":"Raxxxus","date":"2015-05-25T21:23:53.360+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel the metal rendering that it was giving could be changed to a different texture to make it look like polished metal so it has a shine to it like the Full metal pantheon skin does, and since hes a king it should be even more so shiny as a form of status for mord.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2015-05-26T15:24:44.960+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Dude you forgot the best part.\n\nIt fixed his pizza feet!","replies":[{"poster":"Doctor Dyment","date":"2015-05-27T00:33:39.990+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You know it baby!","replies":[]}]}]}
