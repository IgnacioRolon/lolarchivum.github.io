I've gone a couple months without playing (maybe a game here or there, but I didn't notice anything off).  Anyways when I logged on I was greeted with a chat restriction notice. I changed my password and email in order to protect my account. It appears they were on my account for quite a while (8/29/16 is the earliest I see them), and during this time they made several purchases using IP. They bought LeBlanc and several runes. Is there anything I can do to unrestrict myself or refund the purchases made.  \r\n\r\nPs. Sorry if I should have posted this elsewhere.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-04T02:24:09.367+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is the right place to post this, so no worries there! Having others on your account sucks, especially if they jack your IP and are ruining other player's experience in games. We'll have to do some rather thorough investigation into this, so I suggest reaching out in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). One of our account specialists will be able to work with you from here.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}
