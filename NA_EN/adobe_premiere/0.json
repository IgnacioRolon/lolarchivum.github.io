So I thought it would be interesting to think about a new kit design for him. Let me know what you all think!\n\nPassive: Guardian of Demacia - Garen gains armor based on the number of comrades near him\n\nQ: Garen lunges forward dealing damage based on his (armor/AD) based on stance, pushing back the enemy.\n\nW: Stance of defiance / justice -  Defiance stance Garen gains passive healing and armor. Justice stance, Garen gains a &quot;breath&quot; meter that increases damage and attack speed when full, auto attacks and abilities lower his breath meter until empty. When Garen is out of breath his auto attacks are as slow as in defiance.\n\nE: Honorbound - Garen target an enemy that has recently slain a comrade, the comrade is marked as a &quot;villian&quot; and their damage is reduced when attacking Garen.\n\nR: same as before","replies":[{"poster":"Galaxyburstz","date":"2019-02-10T05:40:11.885+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:114}} xd","replies":[{"poster":"Adobe Premiere","date":"2019-02-10T05:44:31.483+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Galaxyburstz,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=nJA3KAyM,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2019-02-10T05:40:11.885+0000)\n>\n> {{champion:114}} xd\n\nI could see that with the lunge, but everything else is pretty different, plus its not like most heroes don't have a lot of similar q's","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"bluefire mark 2","date":"2019-02-10T05:41:43.228+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"R same as before?
