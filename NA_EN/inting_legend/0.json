This happens about 3-4 times per minute and lasts for about 2-5 seconds each. My ping is fine (240-320), and my FPS is about 50 so I don't know what the problem is. BTW, I am aware that 240-320 ping is terrible for most people, but getting below 230 is a blessing to me.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-27T15:20:21.841+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"240-320 ping is really high.  Unless you're playing from a really long distance from NA, that kind of ping is detrimental in-game especially on wi-fi.  Your wi-fi could also be the culprit here, and getting clogged up as the patcher tries to reach the patching service.  You may want to run through our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to help troubleshoot.  If at all possible, just try a wired connection just to rule out that possibility.  I hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
