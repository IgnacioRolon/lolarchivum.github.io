The carries lack meaningful burst or the tanks still just get deleted instantly, or you can't put a stop the healing from their light bonus because you don't have enough grevious. If you go with the flow and just keep taking inferno units because they keep popping up but  you have no items to back them, your damage won't be meaningful at all. It used to be comps > items now I think its the exact opposite. Items > comps, there are way more bad itemization choices than there were last season, heck even rapid fire canon has been dumpstered and barely has any decent uses now. The difference between kogmaw predator bonus/glacial rangers with hurricane as compared w/o is huge and game changing really or ,  turning malz into a mage, putting the right crit items on your assassins/adc, stacking those juicy tank items on a good front line..
