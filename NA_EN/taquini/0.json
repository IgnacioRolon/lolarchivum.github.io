I downloaded the Korean client, and when I log in eveything goes as plannend. The patcher goes trough 15/20% and then stops and restarts and 0% again. After sometimes of doing this he gives the Error 004, it says it doesnt know what happend and will try again patching.\r\n\r\nI tried all things I found on this site, I reinstalled Korean client, I used Hextech tool, I runned as administrator, I updated my windows, I tried patching in pc safe mode, I checked my hard drive and there where no problems. I am patching for 3 days now and nothing helps. I even resetted my PC.\r\n\r\nCould anyone give me some advice?\r\n\r\nKind regards","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-13T03:32:53.970+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahhh that sounds like an error about not having the correct permissions settings in place. Should be easy enough to fix by following the steps in this [**permissions guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) to make sure League is able to access the files it needs to in order to run properly.","replies":[{"poster":"mclovinmkay7","date":"2017-10-15T10:27:27.632+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have the same problem.
