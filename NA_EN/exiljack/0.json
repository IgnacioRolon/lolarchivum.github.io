Iam Zyra main and I would love to see some new lore stories about this place, because i think it deserves some update. I really love all the strories about Shadow Isles, Shurima, Targon etc... And i find this place really interesting with so much potencial. I think that Rengo, Kha, Nida, Zyra and maybe new champ could make this place again interesting with little bit of love. So, do you guys in Rito have any information about this?","replies":[{"poster":"macromite","date":"2016-09-10T17:50:05.765+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't be surprised if it gets deleted. both of the jungles have such a small impact that really neither of them matter. also last I checked kha and reng don't actually have any connections to anywhere specifically.","replies":[{"poster":"Chromatic Eagle","date":"2016-09-10T20:43:18.622+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"A rioter has said that Kumungu is canon.

A jungle perhaps could be put somewhere, but It would still have all the same problems.
