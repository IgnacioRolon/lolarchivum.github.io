I haven't since heard any mention of this, am I missing a post that you can direct me to? Or could I get some clarification?  What do you plan to change, when do you plan to change it, or at minimum when do you plan to tell us more?  I mean, it's rather obnoxious having 819 blue essence, and 10 more champion shards that I own with nothing to do with them.  And while on that topic of stuff that I have nothing to do with... I've also got 40,227 IP and heard you were looking into IP dumps, any eta on more info for that?","replies":[{"poster":"RiotBok","date":"2016-05-18T20:17:54.820+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The current thing for that would be Champion Mastery levels 6 & 7 (out this patch).   Beyond the patch notes, you can check out the earlier posts we've made [here](http://boards.pbe.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/general-pbe-feedback/XT7eu7jz-champion-mastery-level-6-7) and [here](http://boards.pbe.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/general-pbe-feedback/uAFzxTpO-testing-champ-mastery-levels-6-and-7).\n\nThe first should be going over the context of ways for players with all champions to use champion essence whereas the second dives more into the pre-release details of Champ Mastery 6 & 7. \n\nAs to more IP dumps in general, I have no idea to be honest :( It's a tricky area to solve for.  How do you find content/features that won't feel like a grind for players who don't have everything, but also still feel meaningful and not a cheap IP dump for players who do?  Hard question to answer and, in my opinion, one of the most difficult to execute well even with great ideas.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"RadicaI Edward","date":"2016-05-16T22:59:19.203+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ok ty :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"AztecDevil2000","date":"2016-05-17T01:02:16.235+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"wait what if you own all champions","replies":[{"poster":"PoopSandwichHD","date":"2016-05-17T14:02:42.940+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you own all champions, it just gives a permenant champion shard of a champion you already own","replies":[]}]}]}
