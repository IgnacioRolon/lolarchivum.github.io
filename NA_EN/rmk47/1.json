That person is dumb, don't listen to him anymore.  What is happening is that because of who you have been winning and losing against your MMR is lower than your League so you are not getting as much LP.  If you play and either your MMR gets match your League or your League gets to match your MMR, it'll even out.  The people you are queueing with are also likely to be influencing your LP as well.\n\n  Your account is not broken, you just need to win more against the lower level players you are being matched against so just go and Mundo smash the silvers until you get back to silver-gold ratings and you'll be fine.","replies":[]},{"poster":"arcinex","date":"2017-04-05T00:25:28.426+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're fine.","replies":[]}]}
