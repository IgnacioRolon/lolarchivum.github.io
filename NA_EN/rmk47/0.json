A somewhat popular one, as it's easier to blame your account being 'broken' then it is to accept that you might not be as good as you think and it's related to you not carrying hard enough, but a myth nonetheless.\n\nIt is completely normal for people to start ranked, and get repeatedly destroyed over the first couple dozen games, end up tilted, and get destroyed even more. The trick is to just accept that lost cause games are a thing, but you can't help what other players do, and just focus on the mistakes you made yourself and try to fix those. Eventually you'll improve yourself to the point where you really can carry some rather 'rough' teams relatively speaking, and then you'll trend upwards. Repeat until challenger.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Calabok","date":"2016-08-31T03:39:16.083+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it is normal to lose a lot when you are first starting and eventually you will get better at losing less often.{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[{"poster":"rmk47","date":"2016-08-31T04:03:41.029+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"oh? been playing for 2 years like.","replies":[{"poster":"rmk47","date":"2016-08-31T04:04:05.060+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"some guys is gonna help me now  gonna show me some things   10 hours nearly won last game","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Icestar1186","date":"2016-08-31T03:11:37.938+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't understand what you mean by a broken account.
