If you're using someone's rank to attack them, you're rank-shaming them.\n\nSecond, no, that does not mean that you could report everyone and they'd all get punished - the IFS will only punish players who break the rules. Of course, if, somehow, everyone in literally every one of your matches is being toxic and attacking each other with their ranks, and so on, they might all get punished, but, still. You're drawing the wrong conclusions.\n\nThird, ~~if I recall correctly, in your previous thread (which you deleted for whatever reason)~~, your chat log showed at least three instances of hate speech, resulting in your escalated punishment. The rank shaming and general negativity also played a part in your punishment, but the hate speech certainly merited the escalation.\n\nEDIT: Found the reason you deleted your previous thread (if there was another) - you had [another thread](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/O11tqF1m-straight-to-2-week-ban) already with the topic of your punishment and provided chat logs there as per request, and, it seems I recalled correctly, there were three instances of hate speech.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-03-18T01:22:13.571+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Flaming or harassment of any kind is not OK, it does not matter what the words, context or purpose is.\n\nThere are no loopholes, dont bother looking for them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2018-03-18T01:21:39.906+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So here is how the system works:\n\n1. Get a report\n2. Grade the player for toxicity, 0=No toxicity and 100=used hate speech\n3. Add the grade to their behvaior history (same grade for that game regardless of number of reports)\n4. If they pass 100 points, they'll get punished.\n\nIf they only harassed you once with ranked shaming, it'll probably get them ... 2 pts ? People can get punished for it, but it'll take a looonnnngggg time for them to get punished for that alone.\n\nFun fact, in KR server, Ranked Shaming is worth alot more points. Those guys take their ranked games waaayyy too seriously.","replies":[]}]}
