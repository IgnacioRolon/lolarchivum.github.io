The autofill system itself increases time spent finding a game because it creates an incentive to dodge, which leads to entering multiple lobbies before eventually making it to the loading screen.  Ironic that a system designed to decrease queue times actually results in a gross increase to overall time spent reaching the Rift.\n\n2. The matches themselves are lower quality/less enjoyable because you have players forced to play roles they either can&#039;t function in or don&#039;t want to play.  Further, these players are pissed off from the game&#039;s inception and more prone to tilt/troll. As a result, game quality suffers for everyone and no one is having any fun for at least 20 minutes.\n\n**Conclusion: the autofill system provides a negative experience and doesn&#039;t even achieve the goal for which it was implemented.**","replies":[{"poster":"oSEXYPLATYPUSo","date":"2016-12-08T03:27:35.372+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"then become a support main","replies":[{"poster":"PureSilvrr","date":"2016-12-08T04:21:06.337+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"supports still get autofilled","replies":[{"poster":"Roar of Legend","date":"2016-12-08T04:45:41.473+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a support main, I get perma auto fill protected. Yes, after you queue up as a support or fill, you get this little icon that tell you that \"You are guaranteed one of your selected position this game because you recently filled or play support\" The day that I get auto fill into something that is not a support is the day that I will send them a letter. On a different note, the queue time is never a problem for me, are they really that bad at lower elo? I know the higher elo are struggling for sure.","replies":[]},{"poster":"oSEXYPLATYPUSo","date":"2016-12-08T04:25:00.679+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ok so what? just choose FILL and play whatever role you get...\n\nthat is what i do... \n\nya know prior to season 6 when we didnt have role selection we just queued up and by the luck of the internet gods we got placed in champ select wherever we did and majority of the time if last pick you got support or whatever left over role was there. cuz we ( community ) for the most part \"honored \" pick order. but people bitched about it... so riot tries to fix it... and no one queues for supports every one wants mid or jungle ... queue times are 10mins+ and 30 mins + for high elos... and people bitched about that... riot tries to solve that with auto fill... and every now and then you dont get your role and you are forced to 'auto fill \" and people do what.... ? oh thats right BITCH ... wtf do you people want?","replies":[{"poster":"PureSilvrr","date":"2016-12-08T04:29:58.770+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"0.o I wasa just saying that maining support doesent save you from autofill, no need for the paragraph","replies":[{"poster":"oSEXYPLATYPUSo","date":"2016-12-08T04:31:54.291+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if you choose support as primary role most likely say 75% of the time you are gonna get support UNLESS another person chose support as primary... then they might get it over you and you might get another role... it happens but not enough to make a point over","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Flambarge","date":"2016-12-08T03:26:30.443+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You are absolutely right, but we cannot do nethign about it :P so bear it with everyone.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Buzhidog","date":"2016-12-08T02:57:41.428+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Which means don't play Blind Pick.\n\n-proceeds to play Blind Pick-","replies":[{"poster":"EndlessSorcerer","date":"2016-12-08T03:08:32.984+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Autofill only affects Draft Pick.","replies":[]}]}]}
