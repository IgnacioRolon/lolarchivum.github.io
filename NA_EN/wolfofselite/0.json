I can pick up basically any champ and play/learn them quickly etc... but of course there are certain champions that just &quot;roll off the tongue&quot; a lot better. Hmm... what are other ways to describe my play style; I honestly suck at explaining things sometimes :) I for sure like a challenge/a champion that I have to really work on, so I&#039;m looking for medium - hard difficulty champions I suppose.

I normally play Bottom because I was playing some supports, I've just recently been playing Mid with Kassadin and I am enjoying it. I did play top sometimes and most weren't that good because I always had to solo top against 2 enemies for the majority of the time and I always had a jungler that sucked and ended up just making it even harder to solo the top... I have enjoyed almost every champions I've played except for Fiddlesticks because so far he just seem like a glass cannon and takes longer to level. Champions that I have played the most are Anivia, Kassadin and Draven (although I haven't played him for awhile) I did enjoy Caitlyn awhile back...
