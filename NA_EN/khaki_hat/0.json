I didn't do anything to violate the terms of use. Is it possible I was accidentally suspended? I also cannot find details anyone about what they are saying I violated?\r\n\r\nAny help is appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-06-06T19:01:59.273+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"If we issued a suspension on your account, then it was for a very specific reason.  If the message you get is vague, it is because we believe that you would already know what caused the violation, or you would directly contact us so we can discuss it in a private one-on-one conversation.\n\nThe best step you can do is to [submit a ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) over to us, and we will be able to explain why you received a suspension.","replies":[{"poster":"BasedCasanovice","date":"2016-06-06T19:22:43.932+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"If the message you get is vague, it is because we believe that you would already know what caused the violation\"\n\nyou know i am usually on your side but what you uttered there is completely void of sense.\n\nIf you want someone to reform, and that's what these \"warnings\" are for,  you need to specifically tell someone why he is receiving the form of punishment that was issued.\nYou can not be vague.\nThat goes against everything what Lyte tried to accomplish.\nReform cards are called \"REFORM\" cards so you see what the issue is and can act accordingly.\n\nThey are not called \"guess what you did wrong cards\" for a reason.\nMost of the time people aren't aware of their negative actions.\nSo please, be specific,  NOT vague.\n\n\n\n\nps:\nthis is not coming to the defense of the OP, this is to hint at the ridiculous notion that one should guess what one did wrong because you believe one should know why the punishment happened.","replies":[{"poster":"Khaki Hat","date":"2016-06-06T19:46:58.016+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly I agree.

Good call out!  I was trying to walk a thin line between providing info, but also respecting a players individual privacy regarding their account.  Because this player was suspended outside of our normal Player Behavior tools/detection, I erred on the side of caution of not explaining it publicly.  For normal Player Behavior related punishments, absolutely more information is better.  We want to identify exactly what type of behavior caused the punishment so it can be avoided in the future.\n\nI hope that makes more sense!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"RottedApples","date":"2016-06-06T20:51:03.976+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"i agree with what's been said.

I submitted a ticket, but I am telling you I played all weekend and last night just fine and I woke up to this. I didn't do anything to earn a suspension. Even if I said a bad word I know I should have gotten a 10 game chat ban before a suspension.","replies":[]}]}]}
