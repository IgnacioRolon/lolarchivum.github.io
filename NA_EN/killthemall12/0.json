If the update continues to struggle then your network might be having issues grabbing those files.

People have internet that downloads at the speed of light but the PBE server seems to download incredibly slow for everyone around the world. Why does it do that though? It happened roughly 7 months ago and is happening again now with all the new PBE downloads.

I am in PBE for nearly two years. Always slow download.

The problem lies on your side, there's no debating that, at least be up front and say you don't know the issue, or better yet try and actually pass the message to the ones maintaining the server in an attempt to resolve the issue.\n\nEdit: More importantly the fact that this issue has existed for years now looking through the forums, it's just negligence.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
