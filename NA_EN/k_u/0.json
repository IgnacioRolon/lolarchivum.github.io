If you want to get that setup properly I'd suggest contacting the modem manufacturer or the manual that came with it for the basics. \n\nIf you're just trying whatever you can to get a better connection/ping to our servers, I can guide you through a couple easier steps really quickly. Try updating your Port Forwarding and DNS router settings by following those steps in the [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues).

I'm a little familiar with those settings, but honestly I don't know enough myself to guide you through that in the best way.
