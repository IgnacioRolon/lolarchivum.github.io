By most standards, the biggest roster move this offseason came from Fnatic. Jungler Kim &quot;Reignover&quot; Ui-jin, Top Laner and former EU Spring Split MVP Heo &quot;Huni&quot; Seung-hoon, and most importantly the former captain of Fnatic, Support Bora &quot;YellOwStaR&quot; Kim left Fnatic. All three of these players were vital to Fnatic&#039;s Semifinal World Championship run and Fnatic&#039;s undefeated 18-0 regular season. Also, those three players have all announced they will be moving to North America, Huni and Reginover being signed to Team Immortal and YellOwStaR being signed to TSM. On top of those EU LCS champions, star jungler from SK Gaming Dennis &quot;Svenskeren&quot; Johnsen also went to NA. Europe wasn&#039;t the only region who was willing to make some big trades, LCK mid laner from Jin-Air Green Wings, Lee &quot;GBM&quot; Chang-suk decided to move to North America to be a part in the newly organized LCS team NRG.\r\n\r\nWith the rumours of EU not being able to pay their players enough to match other region&rsquo;s offers, more EU stars have left to go to NA and other regions. I remember of course how last year 4 out of 5 Fnatic players left, somehow rebuilding around YellOwStaR was successful. This next split however I&rsquo;m in doubt that Fnatic will be a dominant force around the world. Of course I&rsquo;m not saying saying EU sucks now because they still have star players on Origen and H2K. I&rsquo;m definitely not saying that EU Solo Q players suck because I&rsquo;m just talking about professional play.\r\n\r\nWith the enormous offseason, NA teams like NRG, Team Immortal and of course TSM, have obtained very skilled players from all around the world trying to make super squads that not only will win the NA LCS, but put NA, as a region, on the map for being a great region to compete in. More EU players are being offered money that EU teams can&#039;t compete with which is why great players are leaving to pursue new dreams and more cash.\r\n\r\nFor the past few seasons, NA has consistently been embarrassed by EU. C9 and TSM have been completely dismantled when playing Fnatic and after NA&rsquo;s 10-0 group stage on week 2 at the S5 World Championships more people in the Riot Games twitch chat have spammed &ldquo;EU &gt; NA&rdquo; more than ever. Even though I&rsquo;m begging for the day that I see &ldquo;NA &gt; EU&rdquo; for the first time in years, I wrote this post as unbiased as I could write it. Thank you for reading all of this, it means a lot.\r\n\r\nI&rsquo;m so freaking hyped for this season...\r\n\r\nFreshi\r\n\r\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"YCitizenSnipsY","date":"2015-12-08T04:05:12.941+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"Doesn't matter if NA is better than EU or vice versa, there are both absolute dogshit compared to KR> Which is really sad if you step back an look at how many things have been don to hurt the KR scene.

No body could even take a single game off of KR in Bo5's except for other KR teams. \n\nKR hasn't been hurt? They lost  the entire winter split, which severely reduces the amount of games played. The had the sister rule put in to hurt the KR organizations by limiting the amount of teams and players they could have. And they are the only region to have about 30+ players imported to other regions. Its long been accepted that the OGN tournaments were more stacked than worlds and far more competitive and because of that every year something happens to make the scene over all weaker. \n\nThe fact that after all this time the gap has only widened between KR and everyone else despite all these negative changes to their system shows just how dominant they are and how insignificant every other region is to them. So once again will EU be better than NA this split or the other way around? Doesn't matter because they will both be absolute dogshit compared to KR next split.

You can't say \"eh, but Atletico beat Sevilla\". Nope, Sevilla only lost vs Barcelona and real, beating the rest of La Liga, which at the start of the season is still considered an accomplishment, still better than  what is playing in MLS and getting thrashed vs Sevilla like competition\n\nKR hasn't been hurt as much as you think, because the removal of sister teams has just given the chance to minor orgs to enter the league, and in KR there are more than enough e-sports orgs that can easily grab those spots and offer top level support to the players. The main KR orgs potential incomes are limited , but players and their development are unaffected. The lost of Winter split is bad for the viewers, but KR still play more than enough game to make player develop, so again it is an organization issue for org but does not affect players development\n\nYou are not even grasping why Korean system is so much advanced than the other regions that you don't even know in what manner the changes are hurting KR scene...cause KR scene has not been weakened in the way you are thinking. \nThe only area where KR has been weakened is in the potential income of major orgs and so their potential to keep star players...but guess what happened when some stars left for China money (which orgs are just funded by major owners and not by organization revenues which is still far inferior to KR)? KR even without sister teams put up enough talents to win in fashion style World\nEu scene by being the only league with weekday LCS schedule is more damaged from an economic perspective than KR scene is and still stomped NA\n\nBut don't worry, i'm sure the very moment NA would do better than EU but will lose to KR we'll find the same kind of post from you about how NA vs EU doesn't really matter, right?

Your post was completely unnecessary at all from the start\nIt was done by you mainly on purpose of bullshitting Eu, since I don't remember you talking this way when NA performed better than EU but whatever, you are not going to admit it even when called out, so it is useless to discuss with you\n\nAnyway, getting to the point of your posts, I have explained you why the changes aren't hurting KR in the way you are thinking about\nKR has not been damaged on the player development side by the changes, which all in all is what make region strong in the mid to long term (which reconnects to the answers given to the OP about Eu vs NA)\n\nIn KR there are more than enough organizations that can offer proper support to player to develop to offset the loss of sister teams\n\n> What other region did the sister team rule hurt?\n\nCrs and Dig had to sold Crs Academy and Dig Eu because of the sister teams rule. Various orgs had their good CS teams that could have eventually been promoted to LCS (C9, CLG, CW, SK as some examples)\nSo, also Na and EU were/could have been potentially hurt by the sister teams rule\nBut guess what, where are your enraged posts about the argument back then? Nowhere to be found\n\nThe loss of Winter Split has not led to a reduction of games played for teams, if everything there was an increase in the amount of games played by Korean teams with the change of format switching to LCK, so again no loss in player development side, if everything there was a gain, which goes AGAINST your point like mentioned before\n\nThe export of players have to do with money coming to China in S5 (and partially NA), because some private bilionare decided to throw money to fund teams and buy star players, Koreans teams couldn't match simply because the amount of money was much more than what Korea organizations have ever had/spent with **any ** league format (and NA S6 new orgs are doing pretty much the same thing)\n\nSo, KR wasn't weakened in the way you think or in the magnitude you assume from choices made by Riot. KR was weakened only slightly and for other factors\n\nThe thing that can be argued as factors for KR getting weaker, is that KR major orgs have been relatively weakened because no sister teams means less exposition aka less money - but also means lower costs, let's not forget that either - and that some of the minor orgs support staff could have not been up to the standard of some of the major orgs.......BUT, Koreans couldn't avoid anyway Chinese (and NA) richer teams stealing players cause money reason (and China was yet starting to import players in S4 when Korea had sister teams, and SHRC had bought two koreans when they got to World finals in S4), and that these theoretical development player problems because of poor support stuff would have not been hitting any top team so their level in international competition wasn't weakened, but if anything, weakened only the bottom of LCK standings teams - and the weakening of LCK competition had more to do with the amount of player that left because of money than any other reason, imho -\n\n\n**EDIT**. Also, I forgot, that orgs forcing to merge sister teams also helped to create some super teams with the best players coming from strong teams from the same org, thus creating even stronger rosters that certainldoes not hit the competitivity of the roster of the single org, but if anything could lead them to have even stronger rosters\n\nSo, I'm mad because not because \"you are telling the truth\", but because you are sprewing bullshit about EU, hiding behind results achieved by KR despite the changes to their scene without even understand how the changes have actually affected KR scene at first\n\nI do not expect you to understand and/or answer to proper argumentations to the points I have raised, but I'd be satisfied if some person less stubborn than you can detect your bullshit","replies":[{"poster":"YCitizenSnipsY","date":"2015-12-09T19:00:17.060+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"I said NA and EU are both dogshit compared to KR and you got so blinded by salt because your an EU fanboy and chose to believe that i only insulted EU and started trying to shitpost about NA as if I care since since I started out my post talking about both regions. \n\nI brought KR up because that's really all that matters. In season 4 NA had a better showing at worlds and still got dumpstered by KR. In season 5 EU had the better showing and still got demolished by KR. It doesn't matter who is better between NA and EU when ultimately its gonna result in a rolfstomp by KR. \n\nYour comparing the loss of CRS academy, DIG.EU, and C9 tempest to loss of SSW, SSB, KTA, and SKT T1 S. that's fucking rich. No other region had so much talent that it could stack two teams from the same org. I mean there is a reason all the teams you listed for NA and EU were second rate challenger teams. No where near the same impact. And player exports to china aren't only about money, The main reason is because most of these players ended up teamless when the KR organizations had to condense to one team and couldn't keep all their players. \n\nYou saying that KR wasn't weakened by choices by Riot is leading me to believe you think the 2015 LCK was stronger than the 2014 OGN. No body that actually follows the KR scene would be talking about these rules as minor setbacks that your try to make them out to be. Its impossible to think that KR wouldn't be even stronger right now if they still had two teams per organization and played year round.

EU roster that get to freaking Semifinals at Worlds**\nYou don't need rocket science to understand it, every region was affected from it when the rule kicked in, the examples I mentioned were just the most recent when teams in Na and EU weren't even putting much effort in their secondary team because the rule that forbid sister teams existed\n\nAnd player exports was ENTIRELY due to money, because the amount of organization that could partecipate to top Korean series wasn't reduced, just China and NA swept in and got a lot of players cause money\n\n2015 LCK was weaker than 2014 OGN because players were swept by other regions and the lesser teams didn't have super good rosters. That's it. \nKR would be slightly stronger now because the player exodus would have been a bit smaller, I can agree to an extent, but the main reason was players leaving cause money, not format/rule changes, especially for the top teams that were forced to create super teams\n\n> I don't care how good a regions player development is when the scene itself is being made worse\n\nThat's why you don't grasp the concept. KR has remained far ahead of everyone, including EU, because they have far bigger talent pool and better player development, both thing that have not been drastically affected in KR, as new guys just replaced the ones leaving, and many of the ones leaving were washed up and would have taken spots not allowing these young guys to prove theirselves on the big stage\n\nEu, as well as the other regions, are probably going to be always be behind cause in no place in the planet e-sports are as big as KR, you don't need excuses to explain such things, LOL. If anything, KR, EU and TW beating China super teams with imported Korean players is a thing because it shows how teams can overcome having lower economic resources to manage teams through selecting carefully and growing talents, which can be applied to less advanced regions from an economic or talent pool point of view to have these teams improving and maybe a day reaching and beating Koreans\n\n> I doesn't matter how many great players KR can bring up if they have to settle for a shitty experience once they finally make it.\n\nShitty experience? The experience has drastically changed for viewers, NOT for players, unless you are assuming all the new orgs that got created treat their players like shit, which you should prove at this point\n\nSo, again, what are your valid argumentations?","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"WalkingInACircle","date":"2015-12-08T02:03:02.633+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"NA has many hopefuls but Origen is definitely the strongest team in the West right now.","replies":[{"poster":"Freshi","date":"2015-12-08T03:10:41.852+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I completely agree, but Origen only competed against a TSM that was rebuilt a week prior to the matchup at IEM.

You are only fooling yourself if you think that.

Compare IWD to Gilius, Piglet to Steelback, Fenix to Fox, Freeze to Steelback, Crumbz can compare to Gilius maybe and imo Alex ich > Fox.

Did you see worlds? The jungle pool was extremely weak, you had Reignover, Score, Hojin, TBQ, Loulex, and thats not even counting any of the NA or Wild card junglers (which were all bad). A bad jungler is extreeeemely easy to cover up, as long as your other players are good. I would argue H2K's ADC wasn't too great either, and Odo/Ryu weren't exactly the insane carries i expect to come from GBM and Impact. \n\nA bad support is a little tough, i cant really think of any supports on top teams that are actually bad. However, i think that is more because being a support is much easier or at least less noticeable if you are doing bad. The only ones i can think of are like Kiwikid, who plays really aggressive, and Wolf, who is probably the worst player on his team, but even he isn't bad, he just isn't god tier. I think a good support makes a big difference, but i dont think a bad support would be too hard to carry, especially for GBM and Impact. \n\nBecause the team with two deadweights has three amazing carries. Lets take the matchup man for man then; We'll call Huni and impact even, Reignover and Adrian are clearly better than NRG's no names, but GBM will wreck Pobelter and i think Altec is a good bit better than turtle, and he does really well in protect the carry comps.

GameOver anyone?), and lack Febiven-like damage output to back them up if Huni isn't completely destroying the competition \nJankos is one of the few european jungler that were on similar level than reignOver, and odoamne was not much below Huni anyway (while playing with freaking terrible loulex, I should add)\n\nPlus, Immortals only existent synergy is betweent op and jungle as well as the only existent synergy between H2k roster is between Odoamne and Ryu, you can't really give the edge to Immortals cause past achievement (ignoring these achievement come from NA scene when was objectively easier to geth them), because they haven't gotten them playing in this actual line-up\n\n> [{quoted}](name=C9 Freshie,realm=NA,application-id=9hBQwnEU,discussion-id=rKA9toEw,comment-id=0003000000000000,timestamp=2015-12-09T22:49:01.380+0000)\n> Last time I checked Forg1ven's last team, Gambit, got relegated and disbanded.\n\nMan, you didn't check well I guess\nBefore Forg1ven ban, and despite organization troubles that led to loss in the first pair of weeks in Summer Season, Gambit were in a playoff position and actually the favourites to get to playoffs\nAfter Forg1ven ban, they failed to get in the playoffs, and went in relegation matches that Gambit won, at that point Gambit org decided to sell the spot and the players left\n\nP.S: The new org that has bought their spot has been officially revealed few hours ago, Vitality (a big French COD e-sport org), and their first players acquired is KaSing","replies":[{"poster":"Freshi","date":"2015-12-10T17:41:50.194+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Forg1ven is an inconsistent player, he got banned, his old team gets disbanded, I don't expect him to come back to Pro play and have \"MVP\" status again, he's going to struggle.","replies":[{"poster":"Ale non è male","date":"2015-12-10T23:07:38.523+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Forg1ven is not inconsistent in his own performance, the performance in his team environment was inconsistent, mainly because at times his mates weren't at his same level","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Earl Eulrich","date":"2015-12-10T10:24:21.043+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"not so sure about Huni>Odoamne...Odoamne has shown great potential to carry and great consistency so far, while Huni kinda shipwrecked a great Fnatic team singlehandingly at times.
