My surgery will be taking place at St. Johns in Santa Monica within the next couple of hours. \n\nOnce it starts, it will probably last around 6 hours. That&#039;s just the prep and the time after the actual operation, which will take around 3 hours. \n\nThey call it a Lefort 1, with a bilateral saggital split of the mandible. Sounds scary I guess lol. But at this point I just want to get it over with. \n\nThanks all of you who wish me luck. I&#039;m here to chat for some time before they take me in. \n\nHow are you? \n\nhttps://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/68/a4/20/68a420a9187599a574321ad4bbdbb30c.jpg?noredirect\n\nhttps://d.wattpad.com/story_parts/159534438/images/13ff4271f84bc862.jpg\n\nEDIT: I've been feeling nauseous so i havent been able to do much but sleep... but sleep is getting boring real fast lol. \n\nMy teeth are being held shut together by rubber bands for 2 weeks. I can open my lips a little, but my lower lip is like 95% numb... \n\nTime is just passing slowly. But I'm doing ok. Thank you all for your kind words and support <3","replies":[]}
