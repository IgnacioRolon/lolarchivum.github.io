Some months ago my Alienware M17x R4 started to see random FPS drops from time to time. It happens rather infrequently, usually 1-2 times a day, sometimes not at all. I&#039;ll just be playing League or Warframe, and my FPS suddenly goes from 60-80 to like 5-10 for about 20 seconds before going back to normal. Probably not life threatening, but it gives me aneurysms.\r\n\r\nI think sometimes it happened I checked my Task Manager and saw my CPU was shooting up to 100% for no reason? I&#039;ll have to check again sometime to see if that&#039;s the case.\r\n\r\nI really got no idea what it is anyways, I&#039;m not that knowledgeable when it comes to this stuff, so any help or advice would be appreciated. I&#039;ll be able to check my laptop again when I get home later today.","replies":[]}
