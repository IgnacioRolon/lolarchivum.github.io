Last I had checked i went into Silver V from Bronze I.\n\nI am now in \"Teemo's Patriots\" Silver Division and no more than 5 or 6 hours ago i was promoted. I swore i was in Silver V, but when i got promoted, I was promoted into Silver III. If i know my roman numerals, V = 5, IV = 4, and III = 3?\n\nSo I'm confused? Did i skip Silver IV? or when you promote from Bronze -> Silver are you put into Silver IV from the start?","replies":[{"poster":"Aura Shadow","date":"2013-09-27T03:22:18.764+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You start where ever the game thinks you should be based on your mmr. I went from Silver IV to Silver II once. It's just how it works. It just means the game thinks you belong in silver III based on your mmr. So congratulations, it was not a mistake or anything!","replies":[{"poster":"Mioure","date":"2013-09-27T12:21:37.274+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the quick reply :) I was beginning to think my MMR was trashed since i started in Bronze III. Its good to know that MMR can save you the trouble every once in a while.","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2013-09-27T22:04:54.320+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just want to build on the information here.  Please keep in mind that it is not your LP that determines which Division you are in, but rather when you qualify for promotion.  It is your hidden MMR that determines the Tier/Division you are placed in.  Therefore, if there was a strong discrepancy between your current MMR, and the expected MMR of your division, then when you enter a promotion series, it is possible to be promoted up to two divisions above where you currently are, rather than the next immediate one.\n\nI hope this further alleviates some confusion!","replies":[{"poster":"Mioure","date":"2013-09-28T03:58:02.172+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, Thank you so much.

What I don't understand though is why it wouldn't just throw me in Silver I immediately, since my MMR must already have been at that level considering that everyone I played against was high Silver/low Gold.","replies":[]}]}
