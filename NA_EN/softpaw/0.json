None of them. Only the tab button works for showing the teams. I've tried everything I could find here on the forums and the rest of the LoL site to fix it. Deleting the proper files, doing a soft reinstall with the hextech repair tool, even went as far as to do a complete uninstall/reinstall. After i do a \"fix\" the problem goes away but will then randomly happen again later, sometimes the same day. This last time it was fine for 3 days, now it just happened again.\r\n\r\nPlz Riot! I want to give ranked a try pretty soon, but I'm too afraid of this happening in a ranked game and basically screwing over both myself and my teammates. It's bad enough it happens in random Normal games as it is. What is causing this to happen?","replies":[]}
