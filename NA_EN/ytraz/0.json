For a \"leap\" (glide?) speed, think Kha jump.  Galio would start the normal 2 second channel when he lands.\r\n\r\nThe idea is to give Galio initiation that is not 95% dependent upon flash being off cooldown.  I think that this would also provide versatility for Righteous gust (serious zoning.)  This would allow the rest of Galio's kit to stay the same, with the exception of some possible number tweaks for balance if needed, and bring Galio up to speed with more modern kits.","replies":[{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2014-10-06T20:45:42.242+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You should try to reword it. I'm assuming that what you mean is that Galio will preform an Aatrox dive into the ground at a target area and immediately begin channeling?\n\nIf so, its an excellent Idea that aloooooooot of Galio players want implemented. If also seen some excellent suggestions for Righteous Gust as well. \n\nMy favorite has been:\n\n *Galio gets a 4 second boost of movement speed that leaves behind a trail of wind. Allies who walk in this wind gain the same speed boost as long as they remain in the trail*\n\nThe trail will curve with Galio's turns, similar to a target who has been hit with Nocturne's trail thingy, except the trail is made by Galio himself.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zarxis","date":"2014-10-06T21:43:58.535+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This would be a really powerful change- Galio's currently really good at tanking, he has enough burst if he gets off his full combo, and every one of his abilities has strong utility, *on top of a free-stats passive.* Am I calling him overpowered? **No.** However, allowing Galio so much more control over whether his ultimate hits multiple targets could be a bit too much- his E already allows him a speedboost towards where he wants to ult, and his Q allows him to slow multiple enemies (to set up his ult).\nHe already has an AOE taunt+nuke, % damage reduction, and nigh-on-guaranteed healing (via W+ult)- does he really need the ability to dash on top of that?\n\nI'd prefer to give Galio ranged autoattacks or the ability to cast his shield on all friendly targets (rather than only champions).","replies":[{"poster":"The Red Warden","date":"2014-10-06T23:24:16.160+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I am wondering how much you actually play Galio, since you just sound like a person listing what you saw in his wiki page.\n\nThe Q is possibly one of the slowest projectiles in game and is only able to hit an enemy at close range or when they are cc'd or distracted, otherwise they easily just step out of the way and the mana cost hits you hard. The E while allowing for a good team speed boost has a long casting animation making it very obvious what you are planning and so that enemy team can seperate from each other in time to get out of range of the ult that follows.Also the % reduction you are talking about is only happening during the ult's duration, so it really is not that effective.\n\nThis is also ignoring the fact that any type of tenacity or on-hit stun almost completely negates his ult. I cannot say how many times I have had people walk out of the ult right before it nukes them. \n\nRanged autos would not be good on him though since that would most likely require that they either be extremely short range or his base stats which are high enough that he can survive through the ranged champions from completely wrecking him before he does anything.\nThe sheild should not be allowed to be put on anything though since all that would mean is an indestructible tower or siege minion and no one wants that.","replies":[{"poster":"Zarxis","date":"2014-10-07T00:53:52.820+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sure, Galio's Q is slow, but it's not that difficult to aim. It's AOE and has a fair range- plus you can use your E to get closer, first. Are you sure I'm the one who hasn't played Galio? His Q is perfectly usable, though I wouldn't complain if the projectile received a speed buff.\nYes, Galio using his E during a teamfight is pretty well announcing his intentions, but what do you call a Rammus entering his Powerball? A Shen with a full energy bar walking towards the enemy team? A Karthus causing giant green lights to appear over his opponents' heads?\nWhat is the difference between Galio and these champions?\nGalio doesn't have to use his ult after walking right into the enemy team, while those champions have already committed to a certain action. Galio's E is good poke when he has a few points in it + some AP (from his passive or direct AP). Just having him there, near the enemy team members, is comparable to CC. No enemy wants to be right next to Galio when his ultimate is up except Bear Stance Udyr or Garen with Q activated- but Galio doesn't have to ult right then. Have you considered the fact that using your E to walk into the enemy team with your shield up is one of the most effective tanking methods in the entire game? You get to bait out CC, potentially heal yourself (W + Spirit Visage is hilarious against just about anything other than a fully built ADC), and make the enemy team scatter away from you.\nTenacity does not negate Galio's ult- it only negates a short portion of the taunt. Yes, a champion with Tenacity could act to end the taunt for the rest of his/her team early, but, by then, Galio's ult will probably already be at maximum damage potential, and the cast time of the Tenacity champion's CC ability is likely to be nearly as long as the remainder of Galio's ultimate. Irelia with 21 points in defense + Merc Treads *might* be enough to make a real difference.\n\" or his base stats which are high enough that he can survive through the ranged champions from completely wrecking him before he does anything.\" - Please explain what you meant by that. I understand that Galio's autoattacks probably wouldn't be long-ranged if they were given range, but that would be a buff. Galio's kit does not encourage being near the enemy team except when your shield is on and your ultimate is up; ranged autoattacks could work on him.\nGalio's shield does not make targets invincible (it only gives them MR and armor- no health; the healing effect only affects Galio). We already have champions that can heal or otherwise buff minions (Nunu, Taric, etc.), and their ability to do so does not make them problematic. Giving Galio the ability to W minions/friendly targets would simply give him more opportunities to heal himself in lane and allow him to push harder (something he is currently terrible at- all he has is mediocre waveclear).\n\nThe main reason that Galio could possibly be considered weak in the current version of League is that his items have been nerfed. Penetration (both spell and armor penetration) is stronger, Abyssal Scepter's range got nerfed, Force of Nature was removed, Spirit Visage lost 10% CDR, Athene's Unholy Grail lost some MR, and Spooky Ghosts/Twin Shadows no longer provides MR.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Raptamei","date":"2014-10-06T22:52:47.579+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Galio needs a dash.\n\nHe has strength and weaknesses, but every viable champion right now has only strengths.

He is a protector. Allowing him to dash in would make him too offensive. My biggest wish is to allow his shield to heal whoever it is cast instead of only Galio. An updated passive would be nice.
