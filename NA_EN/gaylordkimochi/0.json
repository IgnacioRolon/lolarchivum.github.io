I was able to \"select\" the champion just fine, set my runes, etc. However just as the match started, no new window popped up and the launcher immediatly showed the \"Reconnect\" button. Clicking on this button did unfortunately nothing. I attempted to restart my pc and launcher, same results. After some digging I found out that this happened before with somebody, the resolution being using the second client in the League folder. Now my league is downloading a patch, perhaps data I didn't have before? Regardless, I will be unable to join this match untill the problem has been resolved, which I hope fixes itself by using the lol.launcher.admin.exe which seemed to help someone else before.\r\n\r\nI would like to kindly ask not to be punished for this leave, as I had no hand in it. I want to apologise to those who are in the game right now (even though they probably won't see this) and wish to apologise if this is in the wrong place. First time on the forums.\r\n\r\nThanks, a very edgy boi","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-26T02:52:19.122+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmm it sounds like you were likely having your connection blocked from reaching our game servers when you kept seeing that reconnect message. Deleting some of your game files didn't start a patch because you were missing files, but when you deleted stuff the client then had to patch itself to fix what you deleted. We can't lift leaverbusters like this, since being afk for any reason still impacts your teammates and you won't actually get a leaverbuster for just one leave. \n\nIf you see this happen again, it's likely being caused by certain firewall settings blocking your network. In that case, [**update your firewall exceptions with these steps**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664#wq3), and be sure to test it in customs first if you aren't currently in a match!","replies":[{"poster":"GayLordKimochi","date":"2018-01-26T18:10:34.057+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow, thanks for the quick reply! Turns out that using the repair option ingame fixed it by downloading/repairing something else. I was able to play again yesterday and will be sure to test in customs from now on before doing anything, haha.\n\nFeel free to delete this thread or close it, since the problem has been solved. Thanks again!","replies":[]}]}]}
