We haven't seen them too much in practice yet, but I fear that by the time we do it will be too late.\n\nThat isn't to say I dislike their ideas for the 'low priority queue' that just increases the time you wait to get into games as an early form of punishment. This is a fairly nice tailored idea. By leaving games, you have to 'make up' the time by waiting longer in queue. That's great... and I think a very solid compromise - providing a punishment that fits the infraction, as it were.\n\nBut the issue I have is the impression it's going to create for people who have leaves that are beyond their control. Especially in ranked games where, according to Lyte, you can get punished after a single occurence.\n\nI'm going to provide a few circumstances to consider... picture, if you will, three people who don't read updates about Player Behaviour systems and don't follow the PBE so thus have little to no info about the new leaverbuster. All three of them are ideal teammates. They're relatively decent players, they carry sometimes, they usually don't feed. They're nice, they communicate well and just generally have a good time with the game. They might even still have ribbons.\n\nPerson #1 joins ranked for the first time since the new patch. He'd played a few test custom games, and not had any issues. Then he loads into the ranked game and encounters a bug splat on the loading screen(new patches can cause this - not every bug gets caught afterall) that he can't get around. He's already frustrated spending ~20 minutes trying frantically to fix the issue only to find out that his team surrendered at 20 and he got marked as a leaver since he was never able to connect. Now, he goes to join a ranked game and gets informed, in addition to the loss, the leave, and his 20 minutes of frustration... he's now been placed in some special queue that means he has to wait 5 minutes before getting into a game.\n\nPerson #2 has been playing for ages without problems. He's literally never had a leave on his record. He's in the middle of a game, doing fairly well - his team is ahead but not enough to close the game quite yet, he's got a good score and is having a blast. Then someone drives into the power lines feeding his house, cutting off his power for several hours. He finally gets it back after an extremely frustrating 6 hours, and goes to play a game... only to find out that the power outage has not only caused him to lose a good game, caused him whatever other frustrations the power outage caused for him(up here it'd mean being freezingly cold for 6 hours, for example), but also caused Riot to deem him worthy of PUNISHMENT for this. For a power outage caused by some idiot driving into a pole?\n\nPerson #3 had intermittent internet for a while, so they opted out of playing. They'd gotten it fixed a few days back, but still didn't play for a couple days to make sure everything was stable. After a few days of no internet drops, they assume everything's good and decide to play a game... then suddenly, the internet problem they'd been working with their provider to fix returns and causes them to disconnect from the game. Already upset at the situation, they then find out that they have been punished for them.\n\nHow would you feel in any of these situations? Would you be inclined to be forgiving or understanding? I don't think most people would. They'd expect Riot to be at least a LITTLE bit forgiving of the fact that these issues happen sometimes and that they're unavoidable and not be throwing around punishments like they meant nothing. I wouldn't be surprised if some people were so upset it caused them to look elsewhere for a game to play.\n\nAnd then there's the problem with Riot's servers frequently taking 30-60 minuts to detect that THEY are having problems... and while I do understand why this is the case and why loss forgiven isn't turned on immediately. But if we're going to be implementing a system that punishes on the first offense, we need to take this into account. The next time someone hacks your servers, or you have one of those sudden 'everyone dcs' issues, you're going to be giving out THOUSANDS of these 'leaver' bans if not more. And not one of them will have been due to anyone voluntarily leaving a game. Every single one will be completely 100% Riot's issue. That's not a good thing.\n\nYes, we get it, a person who dcs - regardless of cause - inconveniences from 3 to 9 other individuals(depending on how many people on your team are actually bothered by it and how many people on the enemy team aren't thrilled at the easy win). But there still needs to be some lenience built into the system. Perhaps the current system is too lenient(I'm not so sure about this but... I don't leave games, so I can't judge)... but this new system is far too aggressive, it's downright unfriendly to the average player.\nI suspect that, in the new system, most of the people punished will end up having no say in whether they were punished or not - it'll be due to almost entirely issues outside of their control. I don't think the number of voluntary leavers is as high as people like to think but I have no statistical data to back this up.\n\nAs I've said elsewhere, if I ever get a 'leaver' penalty due to an issue I had 0 control over - like the three hypotheticals I mentioned above - Riot is losing me as a customer. I think there are others who may react the same way, although possibly without the same conviction.\n\nEdit: TLDR?

NA internet companies have legalized monopolies on their coverage areas thanks to our corrupt government. I have no other choice than to use comcast. Ever wonder how comcast stays in business with close to a 0% satisfaction rating?\n> \n> No? Comcast and Verizon are mutually available in many parts of NJ. In my state, ATT U-Verse is available along with other local ISP providers.\n> \n> And I'm pretty sure, if you /really/ had no other options, Direct TV's uber expensive satellite internet would cover your area - as they cover all of the continental US.\n\nDid you really just recommend satellite internet for gaming??????\n\n/facepalm","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"My IGN Sucks","date":"2014-11-21T22:57:41.718+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I r8 8/8 gr8 b8 m8","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jmonkey71","date":"2014-11-21T22:04:41.845+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gr8 b8 m8 I r8 8/8 no h8","replies":[]},{"poster":"DeynaTaggerung","date":"2014-11-21T21:09:40.547+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Then this system is exactly what they want, once you afk enough you'll get banned and they won't have to deal with it in the first place. ;) It was a good line, I loled.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ShaftyMegee","date":"2015-05-21T23:00:30.129+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like you","replies":[]},{"poster":"Terff","date":"2014-11-23T17:45:02.278+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just think that one game with a leaver in it isn't going to ruin someones entire gaming experience, sure they wont be happy that round but they'll get over it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mistress Madoka","date":"2014-11-22T22:01:24.575+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"OP, You know what I do when someone tells me to AFK?\n\nI don't.\n\nIt pisses them off even more.
