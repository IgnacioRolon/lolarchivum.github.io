And a GTX 1070 is ludicrously overkill for LoL, it cant even use a fraction of the power available even at 1440p 144hz.\n\nDoes it happen if you switch to windowed fullscreen, or fully windowed by changing WindowMode=0 to 1 or 2?","replies":[{"poster":"NCxPRODiiGY","date":"2018-02-11T02:11:30.358+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so update it does work in windowed gameplay but not windowless","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-02-11T02:49:01.711+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=NCxPRODiiGY,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=6r4ZknjI,comment-id=000000000000000000010001,timestamp=2018-02-11T02:11:30.358+0000)\n>\n> so update it does work in windowed gameplay but not windowless\n\nAbout what i expected. What about borderless window/windowed fullscreen? That is the optimal setting in general.\n\nAs far as actually fixing it, i have no ideas. It could be driver-related, have you blocked all driver updates in windows and manually installed the proper video drivers?","replies":[{"poster":"NCxPRODiiGY","date":"2018-02-11T03:03:06.690+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it does work in borderless to just not fullscreen and yeah all my drivers are up to date and the proper drivers.
