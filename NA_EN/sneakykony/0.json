This doesn't always happen. Most of the time it doesn't. But on a few occasions, I load into game, everything seems normal, but I can't click anything. My keyboard doesn't work either. It will let me move the camera around, and the mouse pointer changes when I mouse over things (for example, mousing over the shop turns the pointer into a coin purse). It's really frustrating, and causes me to get penalized for being afk. Hopefully there is a solution to this.
