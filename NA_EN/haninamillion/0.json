YOU PROMOTE TROLLS. \r\n\r\nI try to play and am having a great time. Everything is fine but our bot lane Fid sup and Trist get crushed and we are down 3/12 in the first 10 mins. What ever the match is probably over. Now ONCE AGAIN the bot lane starts flaming and crying. All the sudden Of Course Top is the problem. I mean we have ZERO vision in Our Own jun because we are pushed back to our Secondary Turrets and my team wants to chase 1 low health person into a jun i cant see, and im at fault for pointing it out and not going with them??????\r\n\r\nIm now banned becasue i tried to explain that going into an unwarded jun when you are behind is NOT SMART??????????\r\n\r\nNever Mind That I Just Muted Them After AND THE FACT THAT THE ENEMY TEAM EVEN ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I WAS NOT THE ISSUE...............\r\n\r\nBecause if the team All Decide to Report Me I Get The Shaft?????????\r\n\r\nThis IS MY LAST POST AND MY ATTEMPT TO PLAY YOUR GAME. I KNOW YOU DONT GIVE A CRAP AND I KNOW YOU DONT CARE ABOUT ACTUALLY FIXING YOUR EVER DECAYING GAME.

Being silver 3 by definition means they are not as good as someone in gold, plat, diamond, etc. Flaming is what got **you** banned - not getting objectives and playing the game. You are comparing apples and oranges.","replies":[{"poster":"Toxicate13","date":"2018-01-06T02:24:58.013+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":5,"body":"He didn't say anything about trolling lol.

Second of all, obviously Tyler1 didn't deserve to be banned. If you don't know, he has like 20 something banned accounts, but Riot recently unbanned him so he can play the game again. There are two reasons they did that, both of which are unacceptable. They wanted money, he is one of the most popular streamers on twitch. Also, they unbanned him because he \"reformed\", which is nowhere in their TOS. Might as well unban every single toxic person that has ever been banned if you're going to do that, Riot.","replies":[{"poster":"Imperial Pandaa","date":"2018-01-11T16:55:09.606+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Obviously I probably don't need to explain that they unbanned Tyler as a person to you.

Your last game is never the MAIN reason you're banned, it's because of how you've been toxic in MOST of your games. Always remember that. This game is far from decaying, this game gained over 6.5 million more players in past few years. So don't worry, a few banned toxic players to bring in thousands of more players who play the game for what it is instead of bringing racism, sexism, homophobism, and other kinds of negativity is well worth it. Work on your how you talk to your teammates the next time you play cause you'll be back.
