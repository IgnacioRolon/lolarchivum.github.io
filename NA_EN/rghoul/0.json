I used to play perfectly at more than 120fps (120/144hz monitor, GTX 660), but after patch 4.21 I am getting constant fps drops in every game. I see some people say it's Lucian's Q. I believe it may be related to VFX, however I don't think it's just Lucian. Every few seconds the game hitches and the fps drop to around 15-30. It makes the game totally unplayable and not fun. I stopped playing ranked games as soon as it started, and now I have to stop playing normal games because it is unbearable. \r\n\r\nI tried to link some other threads for different forums / different servers to note that it's a widespread issue, but my post did not go in, so I will not post those now.\r\n\r\nI have tried updating Nvidia drivers, cleaning processes running, and re-patching the game (verifying files through client.) Nothing has solved it so far. \r\nI do not use lolreplay or similar.\r\n\r\nThis is a blocking issue. Can't play till fixed.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nrsam.","replies":[{"poster":"BamBamxxxx","date":"2014-12-13T22:38:58.399+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm having the same problem with my AMD A8 laptop.

I didn't pay good money on this game just for 4.21 to come out and ruin everything. It's obvious it's a big issue because i've read hundreds of complaints from random sites about FPS drops and lag. If they don't fix the problem I will focus primarily on DotA 2 because I can run that game at max no problem.

I used to cap the fps out to 120 just because it syncs well with the 120 hz monitor. Since 4.21 though I go from 120fps down to 30 for some odd reason. Before 4.21 my fps never dropped from 120.

I was completely wrong for getting upset with Riot, but in all honesty I've spent hours reading about Nvidia cards and how to optimize them so I didn't think for a second it could be my card. I'm assuming there may be a conflict between one of my settings and the client as LoL was the only game I received FPS issues with. I also altered the Game.cfg file, which increased my FPS by quite a bit as well.\n\nJust go through the steps on the trouble shoot. I do everything on the list regularly, but** resetting my graphics card's settings to default was the only thing that fixed my issue**. And I've been trying tons of stuff for days.
