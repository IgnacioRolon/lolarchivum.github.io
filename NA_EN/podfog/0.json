In the meantime, a lot of enterprising developers within the community have figured out a way to make an ad-hoc solution using the live data feeds for the lolesports.com website.  While we can't guarantee that method will always work in the future or be reliable 100% of the time, it's been a good solution for a lot of community devs so far.
