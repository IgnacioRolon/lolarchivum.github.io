Fuck your house rules making shit up that isnt part of how the game works just because you want it that way. What a petty reason to troll someone. Riots the one who implemented it that way, youre gonna troll me for using the system that Riot created? Im not even exploiting or abusing it. Literally just using it the way it was designed, and you wanna troll people because they used it to ban a champ they dont want to play with or against? Fucking horrible. I had a completely different impression of you, Im surprised you wrote that. Maybe i was thinking of someone else and got the names mixed up.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2020-02-01T01:28:52.550+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"You seem to think i have some sort of power over how people react.\n\nIf someone hovers a champ and you ban it after they made it clear they intend to play it, the average salty low-ELO player is going to (usually correctly) assume you did it just to piss them off and will run it down mid while insulting your mother.\n\nIt is not about if that is a legitimate reaction or not, they will do it anyway.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele II","date":"2020-02-01T05:34:06.151+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MagicFlyingLlama,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=wN9nzZ4L,comment-id=000000010000,timestamp=2020-02-01T01:28:52.550+0000)\n>\n> You seem to think i have some sort of power over how people react.\n> \n> If someone hovers a champ and you ban it after they made it clear they intend to play it, the average salty low-ELO player is going to (usually correctly) assume you did it just to piss them off and will run it down mid while insulting your mother.\n> \n> It is not about if that is a legitimate reaction or not, they will do it anyway.\n\nBut you said they deserve it. Ohhh you were probably speaking hypothetically, or rhetorically(?)... not sure what rhetorical means now that I think about it lol. You were just kinda quoting that logic that a lot of players use? I thought that was your opinion, that they deserve to be trolled. But yeah, I understand now if you were just like saying thats what will happen cuz thats how players think, but not necessarily how you think.
