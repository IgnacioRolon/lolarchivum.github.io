It has many layers of intelligent and engaging design from fresh gameplay every hour to a replay-ability that could keep you going for literal years. The game deserves to be where it is and that has no question about it. The biggest issue I see with it though, is that a lot of people do not enjoy the game either as much as they use to, or in general.\n\n     I wouldn&#039;t call myself anything else than a devotee to League as a game, so as a reader please take all of this with a grain of salt &lt;3. I feel like League has run into a problem of artificial difficulty. As defined by the reddit user &quot;wrackk&quot; posed in the r/truegaming boards:\n\n_&quot;Artificial difficulty disregards your efforts, no matter how hard you try artificial difficulty with bring you down one way or another (which is its only goal). &quot;Real&quot; difficulty gives in to superior skill and execution, artificial difficulty laughs at it. This is just the way I see it.&quot;_(2014)\n\n     It&#039;s pretty hard to point a finger at any specific situation in League because the game is so fluid with 10 people that your impact of the game is theoretically only about 10% if were talking unbiased numbers, but me and a lot of my older friends who play the game agree that there are situations that come up often where because your enemy opponent has picked a certain champion (and I dont mean a counterpick) your gameplay is essentially negated. One popular example that has been recent is Victor top. While he sits at a 45% winrate you basically win lane by picking victor top and playing him well enough to keep throwing out your abilities and not walk onto your opponent. (weak example ik but try to think of some yourself).\n\n     I doubt that this was never an issue in s1, 2, and 3 because those were my earliest seasons so my knowledge on them is the worst out of the other seasons, but I know it wasn&#039;t the meta of the game to pick a stronger champion and win. It was to be a more skilled team/player and outplay your enemy even if they may be stronger. I feel like that has dissipated from the main essence of the game, it is still around though when you get the right 5 people on a team. I have spoken to other fellow LoL players, and even one Rioter who agrees with the lack of fun in the game compared to what it use to be. \n\n     I was taught that video games were made to be fun, immersive, and captivating to the player. Do you feel like League of Legends defines these ideas?","replies":[{"poster":"3TWarrior","date":"2018-12-17T19:32:44.588+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"it is true that a lot of Riot's gameplay recently has revolved around champion picks and not just playing the game\n\nfor example, against viktor top, you HAVE TO HAVE a champion that has a strong early engage or at least a decent one, or else viktor will scale and claim the lane\n\nWhile it's nothing \"new\" , it has never been a thing that champions have VERY SMALL opportunities to get the better of them\n\ntake gangplank.  In theory,  you're supposed to take out his barrels before he can use them as a harrass and waveclear tool.  Players figured out that he can easily be a lane bully by just using time to set up his domain while he is decent in duels\n\nif you do not have a ranged method to get rid of his barrels (which is essentially only auto attacks or auto attack replacements), you can not counter his instant trade and **have to play passively until you either hit your own power spike, or the laning phase ends**","replies":[]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2018-12-17T20:13:34.448+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"A high school... degree?\n\nA programming and web design degree gives you expertise about... game design?","replies":[{"poster":"jllemin","date":"2018-12-17T20:34:27.070+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=KFCeytron,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=m2p2K5Eu,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2018-12-17T20:13:34.448+0000)\n>\n> A high school... degree?\n> \n> A programming and web design degree gives you expertise about... game design?\n\nLike I said, I have a BIT of ground to stand on.
