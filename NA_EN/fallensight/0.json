And addition to the electrocute nerf it really helps.\n\nI am a zed main and if riot employees have any ideas of reworking zed. I would love to keep zed w, and r remains in his kit and maybe q should do some armor pent for like 40% similar to wukong q.\n\nI play wukong when my zed get ban, wukong w really is just bland and simply i recommend adding a bit of movement speed for his w to escape or gap close from running champs. His r is good but i think it could be better , when ever wukong r he jsut spins but if he doesn't kill them , a little of u die inside. So i recommend his damage increasing per second.","replies":[{"poster":"MasterDClone","date":"2018-08-11T01:13:36.686+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"The switch has finally begun again, when the tank and ad mains leave the boards for the next couple months to be replace with salty assassin and bruiser mains.","replies":[{"poster":"murderess","date":"2018-08-11T02:44:37.619+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Oh boy, getting half a season of having non-tanks viable top was good enough I guess, I'll be back in two seasons, eh?","replies":[{"poster":"MasterDClone","date":"2018-08-11T06:18:25.676+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"sounds great to me, can't wait to being called a troll everygame again","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"HalcyonDweller","date":"2018-08-11T02:49:01.847+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Assassins aren't _supposed_ to beat bruisers so easily. That's how power triangles work. Assassins > carries > tanks/bruisers > assassins\n\nThis is how it should be.\n\nWukong w is only as lacking as you make it. If you are creative with it you can do all kinds of things against a sentient opponent. Against simple characters like Garen and Darius, Wukong will struggle, because they don't have to see him to fight him effectively. That gap will always be there as long as he is allowed to function like an assassin.","replies":[]},{"poster":"breakordoom444","date":"2018-08-11T08:49:39.638+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Based on the name, assassins are not designed for prolonged fights, sure it can be tough with the current meta of aatrox bot lane, but an assassins job is to, well assassinate.\n\nyou might as well go for a bruiser build if you want to stand a chance against them.\n\nZed already shreds adcs and supports like paper, 40% armor shred will just force riot to delete adcs.\n\nwukong already has a gap closer, and with his current build, yommus,\nhe already runs fast with mobi and yommus, he dosen't need more moblity.\n\nwukong has armor shred becuase thats his only source for reliable burst damage, not becuase he is meant to destroy tanks.\n\nit could be argued that zeds E is shit, but its essentially a ranged slow if you do that shadow throw thing.","replies":[{"poster":"Gabresol","date":"2018-08-11T09:57:46.989+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=breakordoom444,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=fxXTEmPi,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2018-08-11T08:49:39.638+0000)\n>\n> Based on the name, assassins are not designed for prolonged fights, sure it can be tough with the current meta of aatrox bot lane, but an assassins job is to, well assassinate.\n> \n> you might as well go for a bruiser build if you want to stand a chance against them.\n> \n> Zed already shreds adcs and supports like paper, 40% armor shred will just force riot to delete adcs.\n> \n> wukong already has a gap closer, and with his current build, yommus,\n> he already runs fast with mobi and yommus, he dosen&#x27;t need more moblity.\n> \n> wukong has armor shred becuase thats his only source for reliable burst damage, not becuase he is meant to destroy tanks.\n> \n> it could be argued that zeds E is shit, but its essentially a ranged slow if you do that shadow throw thing.\n\nthe sad thing is, that Wukong wasn't designed to have burst damage, but as an off tank initiator (the reason why is gains resistences the more enemies are close), but thanks to {{item:3147}} and his assassin upgrade with {{item:3095}} he one-shots squishies out of invis","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Warlord Rhinark","date":"2018-08-11T08:43:18.537+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can't take someone seriously that wants Zed Q to have 40% passive armor shred.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CppL","date":"2018-08-11T08:19:52.474+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im prety sure you a new to this game.Because Bruisers suppose to counter assasins.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Just 4 Memes","date":"2018-08-11T04:32:51.835+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wukong's Q does 40% armor pen?
