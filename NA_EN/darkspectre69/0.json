As a player who plays a LOT through sound I noticed this bug almost immediately. The first build of this skin that went out on the PBE had the sound effects correct, however in the video linked and on live, the skin has the sound effects switched. I&#039;m fully aware that they have additional sound effects layered on top, but it plays the default sounds underneath for gameplay clarity.\r\n\r\n1. Level up Q\r\n2. Switch between rockets and mini gun.\r\n\r\nItem purchases, levels, game time do not affect this bug, it occurs from beginning of the game until the nexus explodes.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2018-01-03T21:40:59.604+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hiya! \n\nThanks for the report!
