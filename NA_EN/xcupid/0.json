Probably Japan... \r\n\r\nI was wondering if i would experience really bad lag. I usually have 40 ping during all my games. What do you think? Good idea?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-02T02:49:18.280+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mmmmmm trying to play on the JP servers while *physically* outside of Japan is going to cause that ping to go up for sure. Just how much nobody can be 100% sure of. It's best to play in the region you're in geographically to make sure you have the best connection you can get.","replies":[{"poster":"DarkRitual","date":"2017-10-02T10:39:49.180+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Best way to know what the ping would be is to play on it.\nMake a new account for that server and play a tutorial or custom game. They still show your ping accurately, and won't disrupt other players if you're getting unplayable levels of latency.","replies":[{"poster":"xCupid","date":"2017-10-07T00:56:36.723+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"xCupid","date":"2017-10-07T00:56:16.636+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you.","replies":[]}]}]}
