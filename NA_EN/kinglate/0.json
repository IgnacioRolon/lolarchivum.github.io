Of course, I get a free win from reaching it for the second time. I just played a game and lost but when I looked at my ranked it says that I have 1 win and 2 losses? The only possible reason I could see is from me dodging a champion select because one of the players was already toxic, but why would I get a loss for that? If anyone has anything that could help me it would be much appreciated.

So in the pre-game chat I said \"How's everyone doing\" and I got \"shut  the hell up pussy\" as a reply. I try my best to steer away from anyone like this so I dodged. I have a screen shot aswell.","replies":[]}]}]}
