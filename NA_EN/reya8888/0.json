Received 1 report and was automatically banned for 2 weeks before I was even able to report the person that flamed me the entire game. (This implies the ban system is automated with no oversight. A single troll clicking you can result in an instant ban) I decided to try to do better.\r\n\r\nI then play a single game today keeping in mind I need to try to be positive and nice to teamates even if they flame.  We had a game where both solos died a lot and got behind.  I tried to encourage them to keep trying and ganked as much as I could.  I even defended my teamates from bullies! Our bot lane said our solos were \"Brainless\" and \"int feeding.\"  I told them they weren't int feeding and were probably just new. They flamed me for being an \"awful jungle\" and begged for reports all game.  Soraka afk'd because we wouldn't surrender from being slightly behind.  They continued to flame me for \"not getting the dragon\" when our mid died right before every dragon spawn.  I asked them to keep trying, but was continuously flamed.\r\n\r\nAfter the game I again received an AUTOMATED permanent ban with no oversight, when the flamer reported me after flaming more nonsense in post game chat.  He said \"you're getting banned because you said the word \"trolling\" HAHAHA\"  (this implies i did receive an automated ban for asking them why they were trolling in post game chat. Check the chat log you'll see me being puzzled and asking why they are trolling)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGame 1\r\nIn-Game\r\nReya8888: nahj\r\nReya8888: thx\r\nReya8888: ignite gone\r\nReya8888: wow he had ignite still\r\nReya8888: i know\r\nReya8888: riven bot\r\nReya8888: y did u run\r\nReya8888: that was free kills\r\nReya8888: ...\r\nReya8888: gj\r\nReya8888: probs\r\nReya8888: ward it\r\nReya8888: cant contest now\r\nReya8888: right\r\nReya8888: with no vision and lv 9 vlad after me\r\nReya8888: ryze we need u to get farmed up\r\nReya8888: y ryze././\r\nReya8888: wtf are you engaging for aatrox\r\nReya8888: we can't win that\r\nReya8888: no.. i ran because they had 3\r\nReya8888: the fuck?\r\nReya8888: no\r\nReya8888: 2v3\r\nReya8888: no he was ahead\r\nReya8888: lol no\r\nReya8888: and then ryze went in even with aatrox dead\r\nReya8888: like wtf\r\nReya8888: free drag again cuz ryze feeds as it spawns, AGAIN\r\nReya8888: YUP\r\nReya8888: its gone\r\nReya8888: ryze died as it spawned again\r\nReya8888: ffs collapse!\r\nReya8888: hopw are u running there?\r\nReya8888: yea new to silver\r\nReya8888: im a d3 smurf\r\nReya8888: not with mid down\r\nReya8888: i don't feed\r\nReya8888: dont go solo?..\r\nReya8888: again blaming me for your horrid engage\r\nReya8888: stop crying and play\r\nReya8888: ryze man you can't get caught like that solo\r\nReya8888: right as drag spawns.
