But how to report other players.","replies":[{"poster":"Saezio","date":"2019-09-13T00:59:17.554+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't you need to play bot games 1st? So you either taught nothing to them until level 5, or you had them report people in bot games...","replies":[{"poster":"Lauchmelder","date":"2019-09-13T01:01:59.845+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're a dick you get reported.

I do missions in some accounts in bots and I have never seen a flamer. Could be just good luck though.","replies":[{"poster":"Kai Guy","date":"2019-09-13T06:05:48.695+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am willing to accept there are humans who will flame teammates for dying to a bot.  I don't think they are common, I really want to not have them be common.  The game is better off with out some one who flames newbies.  Its PvP so with no one to play then ya have no game. Population growth is a good thing imo.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Keiaga","date":"2019-09-13T01:00:27.981+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"sounds like you all need thicker skin.  a bad player shouldn't prolong someone learning how to play.
