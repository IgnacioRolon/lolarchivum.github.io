If you will ho in ranked, for example, and 1st time a champ/teast a build/generally fuck around, wasting every1's time and LP, do you think he deserves a respect? No.\nI'll agree tho there are players who will be toxic 4 no reason, but based on my experience in League (and to be clear, I'm playing since s3 on a server that WAS the most toxic one) not a lot of people are like that. There is always a trigger to it, and it's often other players provoking them.\n\nBased on that+ OP sobbing story we can draw several conclusions:\n- He was unlucky enough to get in the game with the most toxic pieces of shit in League\n- He's overexaggerating for upvote farming\n- He was messing around in games and now he's crying cuz he thinks he has that priviledge (spoiler alert, he doesnt)\n\nWhich one of those 3 do you think it's the case? im betting on 2nd and 3rd","replies":[{"poster":"AvaBabii","date":"2019-04-10T16:21:37.717+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"To be clear, I am talking about toxic players who are toxic for no other reason than someone is having a bad game, new to the game and doesn't know how to play well just yet, etc..

It feels bad.\n\nI can go int for 10 games straight on purpose and just saying I was playing for fun or not talk in game at all and never be punished. Completely ruin the fun for 4 other players and never even get a single punishment unless I type mean words to people that generally deserve it.\n\nYes people can be overly toxic in chat for no reason, but sometimes it's justified and to say they shouldn't say those things to a 0-20 malpjhite running down inting their lane while typing \":)\" every time they die is just non-sense.

Whether it happens at school or it happens online. My 8 year old daughter who is gifted in the areas of reading and writing, as in she has had specific identifications through the gifted services department and psychological evaluations that has put her IQ right around 140, suffers tremendously from bullying because she is \"different\" than her peers.
