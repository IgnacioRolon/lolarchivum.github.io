It could be on Rift or Abyss or whichever, but this game mode only lets you play as champions as they were on release, so no patches to their kits at all. This would let new players find out what it was like back in the day and I think it&#039;d be rather fun! Even if it was just the champions who were updated. Poppy, Taric, Sion, soon to be Galio. But their might not be enough...\r\n\r\nThey could even incorporate the old models too. I think the old models on the new rift would look pretty funny lol.\r\nAnyway, just a suggestion. It could be broken as hell for all I know but hey, it seems interesting.","replies":[{"poster":"Bandle City","date":"2017-03-09T14:56:09.871+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just to avoid OP meta's in this game mode if they did make it though, I'd make it an All Random game mode with re-rolls.
