(And not just the splash art.)","subforum":"Concepts & Creations","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Some of these old legendary skins have no right to call themselves legendary. In comparison to some of the new ones, I feel like I&#039;ve been ripped off.\r\n\r\nIf you take a look at Brolaf, then at Project Yi, you can see the obvious difference. Amount of new dialogue, taunts and jokes. Recall animations, New movements and different looks of their abilities.\r\n\r\nFor a guy who really likes Galio, Tryn and Olaf, I feel that there legend skins are sub-par compared to the ones released nowadays.\r\n\r\nIf this is too much, at least lower the price. Even to 1500 RP so people know.","replies":[]}
