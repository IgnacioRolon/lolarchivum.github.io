(I am.) But I can&#039;t help but notice something when playing as Radiant Wukong.\r\n\r\nHe has a new quote! It goes something like &quot;Don&#039;t fight if you can&#039;t make friends.&quot; Or something.\r\n\r\nThing is, I can&#039;t find diddly on this on any site. Surrender at 20 or the League Wiki fail to have any info on this.\r\n\r\nThoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"Laughing Fish","date":"2016-02-03T15:30:38.734+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Interesting, I know which quote you are talking about, but it is not listed in any official manner. From what I have gathered by reading other board posts and some reddit posts, it appears that the quote was already in Wukong's code, but was just never used. So while it is unlocked for this skin, since it is not *technically* new it is not listed as new.  This is similar to Fiora's \"Let them eat swords\" is only enabled for her PROJECT skin. Either way, here is the quote: \"If you don't fight, you can't make friends.\"\nhttps://media.giphy.com/media/nuTCYnEPpzRYc/giphy.gif","replies":[{"poster":"Wolfinator","date":"2016-02-03T17:21:28.532+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah that makes sense. I wonder why it was never included in the original Wukong skin? It's an interesting quote and fits his personality.\n\nThanks for the reply. Very informative. :3","replies":[{"poster":"Laughing Fish","date":"2016-02-03T17:22:45.223+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No problem, glad to be of service!\nhttps://media2.giphy.com/media/14uoAqOzW4Kfeg/giphy.gif","replies":[]}]}]}]}
