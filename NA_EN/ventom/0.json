I tryed literally everything that riot recommended . I even deleted my antivirus and tryed multiple time to repair client and all it ended was \"Repair failed\" . I can't afford to reinstall completly game as my internet is less than 100 KB'ps and it crashes very often. Is there anything else left to do?","replies":[{"poster":"Khorvus","date":"2017-05-17T15:31:58.240+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are others with this same problem.

Deleting your antivirus might be an unsafe method, so instead I suggest going over each step of the [permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) guide to make sure your OS is allowing League as an exception.
