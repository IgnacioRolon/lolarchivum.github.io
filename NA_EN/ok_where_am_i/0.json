I can&#039;t understand it. In normals sure, but why should someone DROP LP in silver because they couldn&#039;t keep up with diamond players who are currently in plat, when other players IN MY EXACT SAME DIVISION get to GAIN LP because they only had to go against you know... silvers.\n\nThis isn&#039;t just a rant, I actually want to know how this makes sense.","replies":[]}
