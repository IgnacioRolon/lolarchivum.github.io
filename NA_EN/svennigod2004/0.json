And i, like i guess any other in the community, prefer to search 5 minutes instead of 1 min for a game, when this game is much better balanced. And btw, hands down, the Q-Time is so incredible short since riot changed it a long time ago, when the client was new. I dont know how long u need to wait for a lobby, but in 90% its not even 30 Seconds (Support Main). And yes i know supp Q is faster and i think because of my XP also with 2 or 3 mates in Queue, it takes usually not more than 90 seconds.\nYou can adjust this in every elo like u want, but in low elo are enough players online, even at midnight. Or set a timer like in Rocket League, that u search in a bigger \"Elo-Pool\" when u reach 5 Minutes.\n\nBut imho the quality of the games due to matchmaking overall got so bad over the last ~2 years. Normal Games Queue become useless, escpecially Beginner / \"Casual Silver-and-lower\" player getting frustrated tremendously and giving up after 3-10 minutes. Nobody cares about the game and riot dont punish bad behavior when it dont happen in the chat.\n\nPS: i tried that for myself on an other smurf-account and violated the rules on purpose, just to see what will happen and how long it takes. In Ranked, not in Normal. At least i can say, i made 5 ppl happy and 4 ppl sad, so morally acceptable for me. After 5 Games of doing things i would 100% demand a ban for, nothing happenend. i mean, i ran it pretty hard down and literally inted, just kept in mind not to trigger AFK Buster in 3 of 5 games which maybe could have distorted the \"result\".\nResult: 10 Games Chat Restriction. Sidenote: I reported all Player who flamed me hard with \"kys\" etc. and got a feedback message. really perverted.\nPretty disgusting Riot allows it so hard to sabotate the game after not being even able to make fair teams when not playing ranked. Of course i got the CR for being toxic and cynical or for chatting 15 min without interruption.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightsky Pirate","date":"2020-01-02T09:29:36.609+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But you can learn from defeat...!\n\nUnless you're just getting mopped....  :\\","replies":[{"poster":"SvenniGod2004","date":"2020-01-02T09:34:57.420+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"But not in Normal Games.

GO PLAY RANKED IF YOU WANT CLOSE MATCHES! normals is literally there to have a casual mode where people can go, try out new things play with friends regardless of skill lvls and just generally let off some steam. People by default do not try as hard in normals. You can have everyone being in the same rank and it would literally change nothing since people would be playing all sorts of dumb things that they might not even know how to use in any capacity. Why the hell you want high ello players to have literally no place where they can play games without needing to wait over 30 minutes for a single game? GO PLAY RANKED!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nightsky Pirate","date":"2020-01-02T09:58:36.070+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So the solution ... is to play ranked ... where your performance matters?","replies":[]}]}]}]}
