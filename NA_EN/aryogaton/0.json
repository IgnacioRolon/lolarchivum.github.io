If you've ever had that one frustrating day where you kept losing and just couldn't get that damn First Win of the Day, you should upvote and bump and agree.**\r\n\r\n**tl;dr #2 What if every day you get 150 bonus IP EVERY win, but only until your first loss of the day?**\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nLet me start off with a little story of what happened to me a few weeks ago in ranked. Skip to the next horizontal line if you want to get to the meat of it. \r\n\r\nIt was a stressful moment of the year, with work and college midterms and labs to do and little time for leisure. I had been working all night to finish a midterm, and I thought that one or two games of League would help break up the stress and exhaustion. I was in the middle of a fairly moderate losing streak from a couple days before, but I knew that that didn't mean squat for a fresh game. So I opened the client and queued for ranked. \r\n\r\nFirst game, I do fairly even in mid, keeping up in CS and not giving away any kills, but the other lanes lose, making my team overall weaker for teamfights and ultimately resulting in a loss. Alright, I say to myself, fairly common, it's not like I was in a position to carry, try again next game. I fill as Jinx and play aggressive, pushing the enemy botlane to their tower and building a solid CS lead. However, my support doesn't ward, and their enemy Nocturne ults in from fog of war, granting an easy double kill to the enemy ADC. Said Nocturne then does serious work, snowballing all the lanes and giving the enemy team an easy win. Okay, I say to myself, it was my fault I was pushed too far. I queue up again, filling as Jinx once more. This time I freeze the lane, leading up in CS and even getting an early double kill. Great, I'm in a position to carry. \r\n\r\nAs my support and I engage a level 6 fight, though, a gigantic shield appears on the enemy ADC. A surprisingly tanky and overlevelled Shen appears, and since my Flash was down from the early double kill I die fast. Apparently, the Shen had outplayed my top and jungler in a catastrophic early dive. \r\n\r\nI still had a lead from the CS advantage, but that disappeared quickly. A Zed that had been killing my midlaner repeatedly goes to splitpush botlane, and nigh instantly kills me under tier 2 tower as soon as I arrive to defend. The Zed saves his ultimate for me every fight, and my already-behind team can't offer the peel to let me survive. Turns out the Zed doesn't like Jinx as a champion on principle. \r\n\r\nAt this point I'm a little annoyed at my small losing streak, but I'm a fairly positive player, slow to anger, and I never do anything to ruin team morale. After all, every game is a fresh set of people. So I queue up. I luckily get to fill as my best role, but we lose teamfights due to sloppy play. Another loss. Next game, I play a little too aggressively and get punished for it and never catch back up. Another loss. I start going on tilt, playing sloppy, and start feeding a little myself. As calm and controlled as I usually am, at this point I can't help but do a little rant at the end and start of every game. Nothing insulting or especially toxic, just letting off some steam about how ridiculous this losing streak is, and usually how bad I'm doing myself. I call my best role and play my best champion, getting early kills and roaming botlane for a double kill... and then my computer restarts itself for an off-schedule Windows update. \r\n\r\nI log back in to avoid leaver penalty, and get in just long enough to watch the enemy team dismantle our base. I'm on full tilt at this point, I knew that. But I queue one last time. \r\n\r\nAnd go 28-3 as Draven, easily 1v5-ing their entire team. \r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nSo what's the point of this story? No, it's not yet another rant about how elo hell exists or doesn't exist. There's one and only one reason why I kept playing for so long, even after such a long losing streak and after I knew I was on tilt. I dropped 2 divisions over two or three days, and it was because of one thing only. \r\n\r\nFirst Win of the Day. \r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFirst Win of the Day, as far as I can tell, exists for two reasons. \r\n\r\nOne, it's a natural way for players to self-moderate the amount of time they play every day by being a strong gate for IP gain. It discourages playing for an unhealthy amount of time every day, yet gives players a daily routine, which helps retain the player in the long term and is better for their personal health. IP gain is overall much more controlled over time across all players. \r\n\r\nTwo, it encourages people to win. You don't get any bonus from playing a game and losing other than the regular IP reward, so there's never any incentive to play a game and lose just to get a daily bonus. \r\n\r\nBut how many times have you seen someone on the losing team say, \"I just want my first win of the day, dammit\"? First Win of the Day encourages a player to win a game every day for optimal IP gain. For a common player, who likes to play just a couple games a day, this results in the following daily pattern: **Every day, play until you win a game**. \r\n\r\nThere's a problem with this, though. Assuming this common player plays, one of six things happen every day. \r\n\r\n* The player can win, then go on a winning streak. This feels great, but then again, we've established that the player doesn't often play many games a day, so this doesn't happen often. If anything, any real winning streak is more often spread out over several days, which makes the deal feel much more diluted. \r\n* The player can win their first game of the day. They can then call it a day, or play a few more, win or lose. Getting a win feel nice, but overall, it's a fairly okay day. But only fairly okay. \r\n* The player can lose one or two, then win one and call it a day, not suffering from any real losing streak. No real progress in terms of LP, but not too bad overall. \r\n* The player can lose several games before they win one. Losing streaks feel bad, even if you win one in the end, because usually you've only undone one of the losses in terms of LP. Even on a small losing streak, it's a lot more likely that the player becomes toxic with frustration. Positive players can avoid being toxic, but overall this situation feels pretty bad. \r\n* The player can lose several games and give up trying to get First Win of the Day. This feels absolutely terrible, and is quite likely to make the player toxic in some of those losses. This situation should definitely be avoided. \r\n* The player plays a non-ranked queue for First Win of the Day, such as normals, Dominion, or Co-Op vs. AI, where the stakes are lower and often it's easier to win. Well, alright, you got the IP bonus, but the games themselves weren't very satisfying, now were they? This also often happens after the player just can't get a win in Ranked, which still ends up feeling pretty terrible. \r\n\r\nIt's as if every day the player is playing a Martingale, only the final win in the end doesn't at all make up for the potential string of losses. \r\n\r\nFirst Win of the Day makes players feel obligated to get a win once a day. This means that players aren't encouraged to play more while on a winning streak, but are encouraged to play more while on a losing streak. This means that **First Win of the Day encourages losing streaks**, and since losing streaks promote toxic behavior, **First Win of the Day encourages toxic behavior**. \r\n\r\nThere, I said it. \r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nI'm surprised that I've never seen a Rioter discuss First Win of the Day and its consequences in terms of toxicity. I'm sure everyone has experienced that horrible day where you just couldn't get a win after First Win of the Day came up. \r\n\r\nIt's very easily solved, too. The underlying problem is that First Win of the Day promotes the pattern of *play until you win*. All of the problems can be fixed by promoting the pattern of *play until you lose*. \r\n\r\nThis is because the phrase \"quit while you're ahead\" doesn't apply to League at all, because most of the time, one loss isn't going to destroy several wins' worth of effort. In fact, if you're ahead, there's little reason not to keep playing, because hell, you're on a roll. By promoting the pattern of *play until you lose*, the game *encourages winning streaks* and *discourages* losing streaks. And since players are often less toxic on a winning streak and more toxic on a losing streak, the pattern reduces toxicity twofold. \r\n\r\nThis new system still has to accomplish the goals of First Win of the Day. It must be able to gate the amount of time a player wants to play, gate overall IP gain, give players a routine, and encourage players to win (and discourage them from losing). \r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n**Idea 1**: Replace \"First Win of the Day\" with a thing called \"Daily Win Bonus\". As long as you have Daily Win Bonus active, you gain flat bonus IP for every win in any queue. This flat bonus is different for every queue: normal games give a moderate amount of bonus IP, say 100, Co-Op vs. AI games give a low amount, say, 30, and Ranked games give the greatest amount, say, 150. Custom games don't apply. Overall, if you maintain a 50% winrate, mathematically, on average the bonus applies once per day. I feel that it's important that this bonus IP be flat and not diminishing returns, or else problems of First Win of the Day reappear. \r\n\r\nThe clincher is: losing or leaving a game on any queue disables Daily Win Bonus for the rest of the day. Obviously, custom games don't apply. Daily Win Bonus resets 22 hours after the first game played while the previous Daily Win Bonus was active. In other words, if you play some wins and some losses in a day, Daily Win Bonus resets 22 hours after the first game you played that day. \r\n\r\nMaybe even if your Daily Win Bonus lasts past the 22 hours, it'll last through one loss. Or maybe it takes 2 losses to disable it, or maybe after the first loss the bonus is halved. Maybe the Ranked bonus should be 200, or 250, or 300, maybe Normals should be 150, or maybe all queues except Co-Op vs. AI should have the same bonus. Riot can figure out what combination is the best. \r\n\r\nDaily Win Bonus accomplishes several things even beyond the goals of First Win of the Day. A player who loses Daily Win Bonus is discouraged from playing, allowing themselves to self-moderate. Since it resets every day, players look forward to having a chance to gain lots of IP every day, giving them a daily routine. IP gains are more random overall, but mathematically average out to the same 150-per-day for normal queues. And it clearly encourages players to win. \r\n\r\nWhat's more, it discourages players who don't often play Normals, Dominion, Twisted Treeline, or Co-Op vs. AI from playing them just for an easy win, since IP bonuses are reduced. This discourages players who have an abnormally low normal game rating from pubstomping less skilled players, and lets the players who do play those game modes regularly to have their fun. This is especially important for Dominion and Co-Op vs. AI players, where players from Ranked queues are often a nuisance. \r\n\r\nSince this will reduce IP gains for Dominion players (Twisted Treeline players can play Ranked 3v3), this is also a great time to introduce Ranked Dominion, hinthint. IP bonuses for Co-Op vs. AI players are reduced, this is true. However, these players very rarely lose their games, so it more or less just means that every game has a moderate IP boost instead of just one big boost per day. Overall, not too much harm done. \r\n\r\nDaily Win Bonus even encourages players who don't play non-Ranked to play Ranked. And, well, that's always something Riot has wanted to encourage. \r\n\r\nAs far as I can think of, there is only one point where Daily Win Bonus could result in toxicity, and that's that as long as it is active, the stakes in any queue are a little bit higher. Losing your Daily Win Bonus on the first game of the day feels pretty terrible, this is true, and could result in slightly more toxicity if the player decides to play more. However, I feel that the possibility of gaining the win bonus several times a day makes up for this. A day where you lose Daily Win Bonus early can only ever set you back 150 IP per day compared to First Win of the Day, while a day where you go on a winning streak can set you ahead several times 150 IP and can make up for several days' worth of losing the first game of the day. \r\n\r\nThere is only one real flaw to this system that I could think of, and that's that MMR boosting would have the benefit of the boostee receiving lots of IP along with the MMR. And that does make MMR boosting quite a bit more appealing. Well, personally I think this is a small price to pay for all of these benefits, and Riot can always remove the bonus IP when they crackdown on MMR boosters. It's your call, Riot. Maybe the more experienced designers at Riot can come up with a system that accomplishes the same thing without this problem. \r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n**Idea 2**: Replace \"First Win of the Day\" with a thing called \"Daily IP Bonus\". While Daily IP Bonus is available, entering the first game you play starts a 22-hour countdown. At the end of this countdown, you automatically gain 0-200 bonus IP based on your best win percentage across all matchmade queues for games played during the countdown. Daily Win Bonus then becomes available again. So, if you play nothing but Ranked and go 1-1 for the day, you will gain 75 IP at the end of the countdown. If you instead play an extra Co-Op vs. AI game for an easy win, you will instead get the full 150 IP for the day, and any losses in Ranked or other queues won't decrease the bonus for the rest of the day. \r\n\r\nIf the previous idea sounds too risky or too drastic a change, this idea could be considered. It doesn't encourage the pattern of play until you lose, but unlike First Win of the Day, it doesn't encourage you to play until you win either. This idea also doesn't have the miscellaneous benefits of the previous idea, but also doesn't change how players play every day very much. On the other hand, it does essentially force players to play different queues for their Daily IP Bonus, which might be frustrating for people who like to only play one queue. If you lose a game on your favorite queue, you won't be able to get the full bonus if you keep playing that queue. This is true. Overall, this is a lower-risk solution, but it would remove the anxiety in the previous idea of losing your bonus early. \r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThanks for reading. Upvote for Riot response, I'd really like to have a discussion, even if Riot thinks my ideas are terrible. I also have a discussion about the problem with Ranked that I'll write up some other time. Ehhehehhehh.","replies":[{"poster":"NoxiousIce","date":"2014-04-18T00:32:25.331+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't entirely agree with your assessment, and I also feel that both of your ideas miss out on some serious opportunities to improve not only player behavior but player skill as well. I'll address my disagreements first.\n\nFirst, I don't think that FWOTD bonus is creating as much Toxicity as you make it sound like it does. Without large scale numbers though, and a control to test it against we can't really know for sure, though I suspect that Toxicity is only linked to the FWOTD bonus in fringe cases. That said, the FWOTD bonus is **definitely** missing out on serious potential, which I will address after addressing some problems with the suggestions for change that you made.\n\nThe first idea is okay, but when you mention that it would encourage people to play ranked I think that you're actually missing a huge problem that could create. The people who would play ranked in those circumstances would only be playing a few matches, and additionally this encourages them to play their first few games as ranked games. No warm-up. Losses would suddenly become much more detrimental than they already are. You would not only lose LP but also potential IP, and there is the potential of feeling forced to play a game mode you're not really comfortable with. Those who just want to get a quick game in would feel pressured to play ranked just to achieve optimal IP gain. This would also lock off that extra IP to players of level 30 only, and the IP at lower levels is **crucial**. \n\nSolution 2 is bad as well because it lacks the feeling of instant gratification which is important for drawing the player in to those first few games. Additionally if you win a game it encourages you to stop after just one win in order to maintain that 100% win rate for the IP bonus to be at its largest, that may only affect players who only play a few games a day anyway, but ideally you **never** want to under any circumstances encourage a player to play less.\n\nSo let's talk about some solutions that not only solve the potential Toxicity problem, but also actively encourage players to play better, and become better at the game.\n\n**Objective Bonuses**: \nBasically you take a card from Hearthstone's deck and offer rewards to players for trying different things. In hearthstone you have daily quests where often you are encouraged to play either one class or another for a few games. This allows players to familiarize themselves with the different classes available in the game. \n\nThe addition of team builder has really opened up some options here. Players could receive a random daily, which upon completion would reward additional IP. Things like \"Play the Support Role\". On average any quest should be able to be completed within 2-3 games, and if players could hold on to a quest for a day or two so that they don't feel pressured to play it if they don't want to do that today, they don't have to, but at the same time, new quests can only be gained by logging in, or even possibly completing the previous one (or abandoning it). All of this creates the relaxed feeling about it so that the pressure to do it if you don't want to isn't too high, but if you want the max IP, you'll get around to it sooner or later. Since these things are handed out on a daily basis it still encourages players to come back each day and play a few games, and as long as the quests are well thought out, it shouldn't be a chore to do them. They don't have to be all about roles though, the system could track what champions that person plays, and encourage them to play a champion they haven't played in a month or two, but used to play a fair bit. All sorts of options are available here, \"Place X wards\" even, and since ward trinkets are a thing, there would be minimal excuses not to do so.\n\nContinued in next post |\n\nContinued in next post V","replies":[{"poster":"NoxiousIce","date":"2014-04-18T00:43:18.140+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"**Honor Revival**:\nThis one is a bit more sketchy but honestly, anything to breathe life back into the honor initiative at this point. As everyone knows, the honor initiative is practically dead. It was fun for about a month, but after that people didn't see much of a point in using it, and who can blame them? The honor initiative had no effect on anything. The ribbons meant nothing to anyone who was already a good influence, they meant nothing to those who were terrible because the amount of behavior change needed was too large, so only the smallest percentage of people actually cared, and many of them lost it shortly after getting it as the requirements climbed ever higher.\n\nHowever, if you got a small IP bonus for having received an honor from a stranger (someone who you didn't cue with, and someone who isn't on your friends list), and you could only receive this bonus one time a day for each honor type then you'd not only feel good knowing you gave someone an honor bonus but also potentially an IP bonus. Additionally because this IP bonus is unconnected to the ribbons, but connected to the honors themselves, it is possible to reach all levels of players with this encouragement for good behavior.\n\nNow if it weren't for the stranger requirement I'd say that this promotes honor farming, but the worst case scenario is more that people might just ask for honors after games. However because the bonus is for one of each type, unless after every game everyone coordinated for what everyone needs, it would likely just be easier to exemplify the honors that you need.\n\nThere is actually one additionally problem. Ideally you want players to behave good because they want to behave good on their own, but ultimately it doesn't matter. Unless they say \"honor me please\" after the match, you cant tell the difference between players who are doing it for honor, and players who aren't. If you can't tell the difference, and your experience is ultimately better because of the system being in place, why does it matter? It doesn't. Problem solved.","replies":[{"poster":"Aryogaton","date":"2014-04-18T06:46:57.322+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The main problem with First Win of the Day is that it encourages the pattern of \"play until you win,\" which causes losing streaks to very often happen on one play session and causes winning streaks to happen across several days' worth of sessions. I argue that losing tons of LP on one day feels absolutely terrible, while gaining a stead amount of LP over several days feels great, but not especially fantastic. And I say that First Win of the Day is toxic because players who feel absolutely terrible while playing tend to be toxic. \n\nA play pattern of \"play until you lose\" causes the opposite. This pattern, I argue, is desirable because gaining tons of LP in one day feels amazing, while losing a steady amount of LP over several days doesn't feel especially catastrophic. \n\nYou bring up some fair points about problems with Ranked giving out more bonus IP than non-ranked. The original intent was so that people who don't play non-ranked often, who often have abnormally low non-ranked MMRs, don't go and pubstomp some normal games for easy wins and easy bonus IP. If this issue is less important than players feeling like they are forced go play Ranked, then matchmade normal and Ranked games can give out the same 150 bonus IP. Co-Op vs. AI games, though, do need to be reduced. \n\nLosses in this system are a lot less detrimental than they might look at first. It's true that you miss out on IP for the day if your first game of the day is a loss, but this loss of IP is at most 150 per day, at least compared to the existing First Win of the Day. Just one good day with a nice winning streak can make up for many days' worth of first-game losses. Mathematically, and I do mean mathematically, you average out to 150 bonus IP per day as long as you play out your Daily Win Bonus. The only suboptimal play is where you leave your Daily Win Bonus available for the whole day, which isn't much of a big deal because you already feel great after winning every game that day. \n\nBasically, you have a fair chance at not getting any bonus IP one day, which kinda sucks, but you also have a small chance to get a ridiculous amount of bonus IP, which is amazing. \n\nYour points on Idea #2 are fair, and in retrospect it's not a very elegant solution. It makes players feel obligated to play a different queue for an easy win in order to keep playing their favorite queue, which is definitely a chore. ","replies":[{"poster":"Aryogaton","date":"2014-04-18T06:47:35.032+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"However, I disagree on your proposed solutions. There are several things that a replacement for First Win of the Day needs to be to be something feasible and easy for Riot to implement:\n\n* It needs to be simple so that it's easy for players to understand, otherwise it won't accomplish its goal. \n* It needs to be easy to implement by just changing and adding a small amount of code in the AIR client, otherwise it would take too much developer time. This means way less complex than Item Sets. \n* It needs to not affect how a player plays in game at all, except for encouraging to win. Otherwise, it runs into the same problems Riot had with the old Achievements idea that they scrapped (look at some old Red posts, they go in depth about this). \n* It needs to not require any new features in the ingame client, otherwise it would take too much developer time. \n* It needs to not promote the \"play until you win/succeed\" play pattern. This is basically the whole point of replacing First Win of the Day. A flat amount of bonus IP locked away in some arbitrary game action, especially one that requires the player to win the game, is exactly this. \n* It SHOULD be something that the players look forward to doing for the sake of doing it and not just for the reward, otherwise it *will* become a chore. A player who mains one champion will definitely see it as a chore to be forced to play a different champion in Team Builder, for example. \n\nAs you can see, your suggestions fail almost all of these requirements. The reason these requirements need to be there is that Riot needs to think this through very thoroughly before implementing anything, and if it requires too much dev time it will be extremely delayed. \n\n-----\n\nOkay, I agree that Honor needs to be rehauled. Riot has said they're working on this, though, and maybe small IP rewards are the answer, but we can only wait and see what they've come up with. \n\n(Also thanks for being the first person to bother to comprehend what this thread is trying to say. I posted it on GD and it went miles over their heads.)","replies":[{"poster":"NoxiousIce","date":"2014-04-18T18:12:59.941+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I disagree with what it needs to be though. I think that your rules for designing the system are wrong.\n\nThe idea that implementation needs to be easy and development time needs to be small is irrelevant. No matter what you do it is likely to be a chore to change because the FWOTD bonus has been around for a long time, and so the code that manages it is likely to be buried pretty deep. Even if it isn't, the future of the game and the way that people experience it is worth way more than any amount of development time extra it would take to change things in a more significant manner.\n\nI think you're looking for a simple solution because you want it to be implemented quickly, but the reality is that Riot is slow to do *anything* involving the air client. Additionally none of this is nearly on the complexity level that adding item sets is.\n\nNone of my suggestions would actually require in-game changes, as the systems for tracking a lot of statistics in game already exist, and they already export to the air client as well. \n\nI agree that it needs to be simple enough for players to understand, but  I don't see that being a problem with anything that I suggested.\n\nThe biggest thing that I offend on your list at this point is affecting the way that players play the game in game, which I would argue that it doesn't even really do. The wards were an off-hand comment, and additionally, the idea is that they would use their free ward trinket that everyone gets anyway. So the worst it would do is serve as a reminder to use the active item they already have. Additionally, if it were simply daily quests to \"go play this thing\" then the only change in the way they play the game is outside of the actual game.\n\nThe feeling like a chore is a problem, but it is also a problem with the current system, and would be a problem with either of your suggestions as well. This is almost unavoidable because inevitably someone will feel like its a chore unless you literally just give them IP on their account. Not even having a log in requirement. I understand the desire to minimize it but I think that you have to choose a point that is good enough. \n\nYou mention some concerns about players who only play one champion. Having played extensively with one of those players I can say with confidence that this inflexibility is in itself toxic. Perhaps less so with team builder in place now, but it isn't magically fixed. This behavior causes an unwillingness to cooperate in champion select, and is a serious detriment to your team's ability to win. The player who only plays one champion may not actually be toxic, but they have a toxic effect on the game and those around them. So discouraging this behavior can only be good. Additionally, a greater understanding (through play) of the champions they face can offer a boon to them while playing their favorite champion.\n\nTo summarize: I disagree with the requirements that you have set forth for a FWOTD, and as a result disagree with your assessment of my suggestions. While I admit that they are not perfect, they are still worlds better than the current system, and because perfection is impossible, a point of \"good enough\" must be set.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"danceforpie","date":"2014-04-18T16:01:45.749+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Loving this post so far.
