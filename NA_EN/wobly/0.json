It allows for his snares power to remain consistent throughout the entire game. Since hes a damaged based champion keeping his snare duration the same is a good thing since it allows him to scale his primary asset (damage) rather than having to invest in his minimal utility. With a utility champion like {{champion:40}} you max her shield first because it's her primary asset. \n\nMaxing Sol's e would just be strange. His e was designed around being the last ability you max. The benefits of the ability don't scale well enough to worth maxing. Asking to have every max order to be viable is asking to restructure the entire balance of the game. How do you make it viable to max Lucain W first? Or ashe E? Or Bard W? \n\nPlayers have a choice as to how they want to build Ryze, but there is always going to be an optimal way.

But in my opinion, If i wanna play BARD passively and just focusing on healing a lot , it should be a viable option for me to play Bard that way. \n\n... Or you can just play Soraka, who actually is based around passively poking and undoing any of the enemy harass.\n\nI mean some champions are versatile in what they do, but that's not an innate part of being a champion - in fact, most versatile champions pay for being so versatile by being overall weaker than the more focused competition. Bard's W isn't really a \"heal,\" it's just a way for him to aid a teammate when he's not around. Provide them some extra sustain, effectively being some regen that can be tapped into at a later time. This is because you've just flat-out picked the wrong champion if you want someone who can play passively; every part of his kit is designed around either being more powerful when you roam, or enabling roaming flat-out.\n\nMaking him able to opt into just being someone who picks his nose / mouth hole and acts as a healbot would require weakening his ability to roam aggressively ( so he can't do both and be dominant ) which in turn just leads to him losing what makes him unique. Which is rather silly, as if you just want to play a passive healbot, again, you just can play Soraka.\n\nThe primary way you determine your playstyle for a match comes in champion select. You can alter the details of exactly how you're playing through items, skill builds, and ( although this is technically champion select too ) runes, masteries, and summoner spells, but the way you define the core of what you'll being doing and how you'll do it is through picking the champion best suited for what you want to do. If that wasn't the case, there might as well not be any champions at; League might as well give you a generic template character and let you define what you'll be doing through picking abilities or having a large collection of active item that make up for the base abilities being very generic and broad.","replies":[]},{"poster":"bulldoggamer","date":"2016-07-22T04:17:38.895+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"His HP packs scale like booty.\n\nAlso on old ash the gold earned didnt go up with rank in e.

Plus this line is used so much, no one really cares about it at this point. It just makes you come off as a loud idiot, no offense.\nSecondly, yes, they seem to have shifted his power balance a bit. It's a rework. It's not the Ryze we knew, but it's just that. A rework.\nThirdly, why complain? Riot gives no cares.","replies":[{"poster":"genya03","date":"2016-07-22T02:03:09.823+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Sorry. I'm mad as hell right now. This Ryze just pisses me off every time I see him being played. Every time someone mention about the new Ryze I just mute them in chat. A rework? I don't mind, but this Ryze has to go. Riot will not understand the player base if we don't say something. Of course, Riot doesn't give a fuck. But us players do.","replies":[{"poster":"Keepe","date":"2016-07-22T02:26:33.549+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why does it piss you off? Wave clear isn't inherently a bad thing. For me, what irks me is the lack of creative and unique content to it. And you are right. I miss the older MR shred, it meant Ryze had better choices to itemize as a more brawling mage type that ISN'T a pain in the ass like Gragas. I do miss Spell Vamp, but Riot's going through it's Edgy Phase so... just give them time. I do think that this new Ryze is just a rehashed Medivh from the Warcraft Universe. I think that Riot had a chance to create something unique and instead dropped the ball with his ultimate. I am sure even you could admit that if they moved his Pen to his old ult and kept that, it would have been a more acceptable rework. But, alas, Riot went to see the Warcraft movie and climaxed themselves at the idea of ripping off a rather neat concept of an ability.\n\nIn short, my issue with his rework is mostly his ultimate.\n\nIt is a cool skill, and honestly, I DO want to see it in LoL.\n\nBut NOT on a champion that has been marketed from the beginning as a beginner friendly champion. Not on a champion whose kit does not reflect the use of such utility. Not on an champion that it does not FEEL right on.\n\nHell, if they threw that ult on Bard instead of his Zhonya's ult, you must admit it would feel far more satisfying than on the champion they gave it.\n\nI know why you're angry. I know where you're coming from. But getting mad and ranting won't help. Who knows, you may be right though. Maybe Riot CAN be convinced that they made a mistake. But you and I both know they won't. \n\nRiot does not care about it's player base. Not in the slightest.\n\nThe only thing Riot cares about is making abilities that can possibly make \"LoL tEh PlAyS\" in the LCS.\n\nThe only thing Riot cares about is making money.\n\nRiot does not, in the tiniest bit, care about us.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"YungSick","date":"2016-07-21T23:29:57.961+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:13}} I feel like may need a nerf considering he does a lot of damage with his e and q, but maybe later down the line because he is on a learning curve for like almost the whole community still.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DænariusKhølerin","date":"2016-07-22T03:00:09.373+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd say he's going to take more time since he's actually a hard champion that you can't just pick up and learn like Taliyah that just recently came out.

First, he will be not a ranged champion. Second, I think he will throw his spear if I would call it like that, and will hit with his gun just like on his video. Third, I think he will move to fast and the last I think would be a hit from that thing Kled \"drive\". About his passive I'm not sure if he will move quick or he will have a passive like he will walk in a curve way. I hope I can get any information more.
