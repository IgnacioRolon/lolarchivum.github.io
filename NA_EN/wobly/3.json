On the one hand, this makes sense since it eliminates the issue where Ryze had only one viable build path that gave him the most possible damage and defense. On the other hand, I think it will probably lead to Ryze being built more like a typical AP mage. Part of the reason you picked Ryze before the rework was that he gave you sustained magic damage from a champ who wasn&#039;t squishy and vulnerable to assassins. Now with a more AP focused build, it seems like he&#039;ll be a late game short range mage with high sustained damage who needs to stay in the backline with the ADC to avoid getting deleted.\r\n\r\nWhy would you pick the new Ryze instead of say, Karthus, Viktor, or Cassiopeia, who all have that same role down? What is it about his kit that makes him a unique pick? I don&#039;t think I see it right now.","replies":[{"poster":"RiotRepertoir","date":"2015-04-11T02:25:13.783+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":2,"body":"Following this update, there should still be a few reasons to pick Ryze over other sustained damage mages you've mentioned:\n\n* Strong anti-mobility. Rune Prison remains as a point-and-click instant root on a target.\n* Difficult to burst down when played well. Even though Frozen Heart is less core on this Ryze so he won't just always be baseline tanky, he has a shield and instant root that makes him a less viable target for assassins and the like.\n* Strong matchups in top lane. Given his kit, Ryze has historically (and probably will still) have more favorable matchups against some of the top lane melee roster than Karthus, Viktor, Cassiopeia, etc. This allows teams to get high mid-late game damage from this position\n* Very powerful in double AP comps. Percent MR shred enables double AP comps to not fall off so hard against teams that run heavy MR.\n\nHope this helps!","replies":[{"poster":"Wobly","date":"2015-04-11T02:54:36.957+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the response. I'm glad you guys had a clear idea of what you wanted to be unique about him. It all sounds good, my only reservation is how that second point will turn out once he hits live. Good luck with the final tweaks.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ItemsGuy","date":"2015-04-11T14:13:04.895+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aside from in-game statistics and damage types etc. (he can do magic damage and is tanky and has a shred and can bully enemy top lanes and this and that), which can change wildly and unintentionally with the state of the game or also be associated with other champions within the role, what's the main reason one should always be able to pick Ryze and be comfortable with him having a proper spot on a team, even if by numbers or mechanics (ex. current meta favors sustained CC rather than bursts of it, or HP is being prioritized over MR, etc.) he is less \"powerful\" than other picks? What's the unique gameplay niche that Ryze would occupy, that can't be described with raw in-game stats or individual mechanics (such as Rengar being a preparation-based, brush-favoring assassin, who can be comfortably picked as long as there are non-player units to build Ferocity on and some amount of brush)?\n\nRight now, it looks like a lot of how you categorize individual champions and justify their \"uniqueness\" on a roster of over 100 competing champions, is through a raw combination of the individual mechanics in their kit (Ezreal is \"unique\" because he's a _mobile_, _poke_ carry with a _global ult_, which...means there's really only one or two degrees of separation between him and Corki \"1 Armor Shred And 3 Magic Damage Abilities\" The Daring Bombardier, meaning one is going to be \"more viable\" than the other at any given time), rather than the implications of their playstyle on a larger, strategic scale. As a point of reference, in DotA, you have Broodmother, who you pick because of her ability to dominate chunks of the map with her spider  webs (which she then uses to set up kill zones or pressure lanes), and Chen, who you pick because of his roaming, monster-based utility and protective (and Enchantress, who you pick because of her roaming, monster-based utility and chasing power).\n\nAt the PAX panel, you guys talked a lot about wanting champions to have unique inputs, outputs, and strategic niches--and that got me really excited, because that's what League really, *really* needs at this point (especially with S5's focus on strategic diversity, one of the most important things in a game with over 100 playable characters), but I'm not seeing much of any of those three in Ryze--and even what I *do* see (the windows of power and cluster-based E damage) doesn't fit with the rest of the kit particularly well or in any way that could create a strong enough niche for our favorite blue mage, here.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sire Hippington","date":"2015-04-10T19:09:18.490+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"The main point off picking Ryze remains the same: You can afford to built rather tanky and still deal high damage, and most of all you have a range point n click instant lockdown.

If you run the numbers, his individual abilities actually do less damage in the new kit if he uses his old bruiser build. You do, however, get significantly more damage from an AP build now.\n\nThe Rune Prison is a nice reliable lock down, but I'm not sure it's enough to differentiate Ryze from similar champions like Cassiopeia, who also has kiting / slowing potential even if it is a little less reliable.","replies":[{"poster":"Sire Hippington","date":"2015-04-10T19:50:24.455+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"nerfed mana increased ap ratios? thats true for Q, but E got double the mana ratio and less ap than befor, and W has slightly less mana and far less ap....\n\nhe still deals enough damage with AA+Roa+FH+SV+random last item","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"MetalGearTeemu","date":"2015-04-10T19:06:56.338+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":6,"body":"He can't be reliable, all teamfights must be clusterfucks of wiffed skillshots even at high level. \n\nRiot *HATES* reliable strategy and drafting, and has to add that random element of constant skillshot wiffs turning fights.

However, given that he still has a point and click root at the same range as before, outside of lane he is just as reliable.

So he lost some mana ratios so the 400 mana doesn't give him AS MUCH damage as it does on live currently. So what? Most mages build a defensive item, it's just usually Zhonyas and Zhonyas has too much AP for what it gives anyway. \n\nSo he has 30% CDR and you'd be \"wasting\" 10% of Frozen Heart's CDR. So what? Glacial Shroud is still a good build in lane and you're likely going to finish Frozen Heart before you hit 16 anyway. If you try to force yourself to build only 10% CDR to avoid \"wasting\" the CDR on his ult you're going to gimp yourself by spending most of the game without 40%. I'd rather have my damage transition from mid to late be a little off than just straight up have a terrible mid-game because I'm only buying 30% CDR on a spammable mage.\n\nFrozen Heart gives 100 armor and an aura that reduces the sustained damage the enemy team is able to deal. Ryze, being someone who deals sustained damage, can use this to turn team fights into prolonged trades (that he will win). The item is still amazing on him. Just because it's not as amazing as on live currently doesn't mean everyone needs to stop building it. It's utility, and it's tank. Ryze needs both of these, not just hyper damage.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MrBuffington","date":"2015-04-11T04:33:51.710+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To me (I have a handful of games on PBE), Ryze still feels like that same speedy rapid fire battle mage, even without FH. He still scales with mana, so if he's not building FH he can go RG, which honestly helps his engage/sticking potential, something very important to Ryze. Just because he gets free CDR on his ult, plus he scales with mana kind of keeps him from building like a typical mage; he can afford to go tankier, since he's getting damage from mana, where champs like Karthus or Cassiopeia don't really get damage from building mana.\n\nThere are definitely changes to how he feels; his passive adds a whole new dimension that you have to play around and you might need to learn some new combos to really maximize it, not to mention the Q skillshot causes you to pick fights differently; I'm not sure all his numbers are quite right yet, but overall he still pretty much feels like the same champion as live Ryze: his W is still awesome, he rapid fires spells (his passive opens up some pretty crazy long combos), he's still pretty tanky (especially for a mage), he runs really fast (esp with ghost+flash, RG, & ult).","replies":[]},{"poster":"GaleWinUnleashed","date":"2015-04-10T23:02:55.500+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They shifted some of his tankiness from his build into his passive shield. I expect his normal build now will tend rather more toward AP than it did before, though AA Staff and Rod of Ages should still be core items.\n\nRyze retains his previous ability to guarantee a lockdown on any single target, then deal heavy focused damage to that target and a small area around them.
