Is it just to standardize mana regen into a percent based model? Is it to buff those supports? Does Riot feel that mana intensive mages needed an early game nerf? Will they be compensated?","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2015-05-20T05:02:08.975+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":3,"body":"Our current focus with the Utility masteries is on making going deep into the tree appropriately rewarding, particularly for caster supports and more utility focused mages.
