The boards tell me that my account is too low of a level! I'm relatively sure they're talking about the in-game leveling system (correct me if I'm wrong). If so my account should be level 30. Why can't I post a discussion? Thanks!","replies":[{"poster":"NEUT","date":"2017-12-23T08:47:19.160+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This appears a common occurrence from what I've seen. Pardon for necro'ing the thread, but I thought it might be better to at least test-post on the relevant discussion. \n\n(Glad you got it working!)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-08T05:43:30.791+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You were right!
