I've been having this strange problem where after a game has completed, the game lags out quite hard. It takes a good 1-2 minutes to load, and the client becomes unresponsive. It also has the side effect of doing strange things to my client. For example, the client sometimes locks me out of selecting rune pages every now and then claiming that I am below level 8. Very strange indeed.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-19T23:54:19.502+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's.....really really weird that the client would freak out and think you're under level 8 randomly o_O. I'd try running a quick repair for that to see if it corrects some incorrectly read client file.\n\nFor the issue with your client being unresponsive after games, I wonder if that's due to you having the \"close client during game\" option turned on and the client is struggling to reopen. Check that in the client options and turn it off if it's already on.","replies":[{"poster":"YourMuffinsSuck","date":"2017-11-21T05:30:39.135+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have solved the issue by checking if the \"close the client during game\" option was on or not. It was off, but then to see what would happen if I turned it on, I did. By having the option on it actually solved the issue instead of being the cause of the issue.","replies":[]}]}]}
