I have not changed anything about my system since I played before their release, but after no matter what time of day, I've been receiving the exact same sort of lag spikes. I have not experienced lag spikes in any other game or anything else I do and have performed a ping test that I let run for longer than it has been taking for lag spikes to hit in league without the ping ever jumping over 36 ms, where as in a league game I'll have spikes of 150 to 255 ms. They are short but long enough to make quick encounters or creep score take a strong hit. I tried re-installing my game with no apparent effect on the lag spikes. I've had lag spikes int he past but it was always obvious that there was a known issue or I also experienced them elsewhere but it is apparent to me that this is isolated to just league for me and I haven't seen any other posts concerning anything similar. \r\n\r\nI would appreciate any help on this.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-28T21:51:28.322+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looks like [**Riot JxE made a quick post**](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/lZv6E2Xz-update-on-fps-issues-in-722-and-723) detailing some of these issues, as well as asking for data if this is happening to you to help them figure out a solid fix.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tàhliá","date":"2017-11-28T03:32:12.156+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"the exact same thing is happening to me. my internet loads fine and everything but my ping in league is constantly spiking when it used to sit on around 40 ms before patch 7.23. it used to be obvious that the problem was on my end because my web pages wouldn't load either but this time its clearly not.\n\ni sent a support ticket but they gave me a pretty useless reply saying i might have programs open that could be causing this....the programs i have open have ALWAYS been open and i've never lagged while having them open.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ren ShadeCrest","date":"2017-12-01T07:29:19.955+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"@Broporo\n\nI took a look at that post and it seems like a different issue. If I uncap my frame rate it stays at 320fps (I have anew, really nice pc), and thats not even a problem, it's like hiccup lag spikes. Very instantaneous and sometimes I can't move for a moment or two. It makes it impossible to ever really play. I've been just about having to avoid league because of it but I try again every few hours. The spikes have gotten worse and now shoot up to around between 152-1k ms. Never had this issue before the hunter release and now I have it every day after, all day, and no problems on anything else I run.","replies":[]}]}
