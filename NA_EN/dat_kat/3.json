( NEED A RED REPLY ASAP )","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"After updating to the client I experience 2 serious issues, even after restarting client and the PC. The first problem is I cannot switch between skins after we've all locked our champs. Every time I transition on another skin I get a popup message saying \"failed to select the skin\" or something like that. And I end up playing with the skin I had picked before the update. Second problem is after the first game has finished and I queue for another one, when a match is found and I click accept or decline (doesn't matter) the client just completely shuts down by itself and a bugsplat message apprears.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-01T20:30:56.795+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's a little weird that your skin selection keeps giving you that error. It almost sounds like the client doesn't realize that you have that skin unlocked, so it's not sure if it can let you choose it or not. Let's try resetting your config files to make sure nothing is going wrong there. \n\n- Log into the game client\n- Navigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\n- Delete the file  named **game.cfg** and **persistedsettings.json**\n- Go into a custom game and verify that settings have saved properly. \n- Leave game to sync settings\n\nSeeing those bugsplats when the queue pops is most likely happening due to some corrupted game files in your client. For that I'd suggest going through the steps in this [**crash guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974) for most of the typical fixes. Hit me back up if nothing seems to be helping though!","replies":[{"poster":"Dat Kat","date":"2017-06-01T22:54:26.993+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I initiated a full fix just in case there were any corrupted files, the problem still persisted. But I'll do the following steps you provided and tell you the results\n\nOn a note, The skins on draft doesn't actually have the lock on them because I own them, so the client knows that much, it just won't let me pick any other skin besides the one I had pre-patch, even the classic skin won't be picked. Also, I noticed that it only happens on draft pick. I tried initiating a custom game and I could transition from skin to another just fine, after testing, I queued for a ranked game and the problem still persisted, won't let me switch skins.\n\nFINAL EDIT: Turns out, its a problem that exists to 80% of the people on the eu servers. All my friends and the ones I just played with in game on rankeds are experiencing the same problem, they can't change their skins. All of them are stuck with the ones of pre-patch. Please Broporo raise awareness of this issue to riot's HQ. Its a problem on the EU servers specifically happening to everybody, not just me. Also I did what you told me, didn't work. This needs a fix from Riot themselves, appreciate the help though, thanks <3","replies":[{"poster":"Kürama","date":"2017-06-02T02:10:14.365+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://puu.sh/w8e6g/7ed37b564a.png\n\nUnsure if this is related but I'd try again in a few hours.
