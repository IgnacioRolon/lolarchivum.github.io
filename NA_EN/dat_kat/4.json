I'm basically interacting with the client based on my memory of what it looked like on euw and that doesn't always work specially in the in game settings. \r\nSo I've been wondering if there is a way I could manually change the language of the client to English and maybe the voices of the champs too because It really annoys me to listen to them with other voices and languages. \r\nThanks in advance.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-25T03:51:27.520+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There may be a way to change them manually, but unfortunately, I won't be able to assist you with a manual change since we don't support them. =/\n\nIf you have any other questions, let me know!","replies":[{"poster":"Dat Kat","date":"2017-01-25T08:39:56.491+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You don't support them meaning if I do somehow change them manually from guides on youtube, will I be banned?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-25T23:04:55.042+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"We typically look for modifications that intend to provide a competitive advantage over others when we suspend accounts for modifications.
