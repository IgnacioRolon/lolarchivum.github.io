I have the summoner name Diana Bot on PBE and on the PBE discussion boards. I can't log into either of them. My login details haven't changed. I tried resetting/changing my password but that isn't working either. Whenever I try to login on PBE I just get an incorrect login message, same with the pbe.boards. Any help would be really appreciated. I don't want to lose my Diana Bot name on PBE.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-29T22:32:31.667+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're getting the incorrect username/password issue it's likely that something might have been changed without you knowing.
