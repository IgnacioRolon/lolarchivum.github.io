Leveling up isn't the only way to get BE.

It's designed to make players get impatient and just spend money to get to what they want faster. The player support here mentions that there are \"other ways of getting capsules/chests...\" and I would like to say to that that the only way to get the other types of capsules/chests are to get an S- or higher with your champ or a premade teammate which takes having a good game BUT the caveat there is that you can only get about 1 chest a week so even if you have multiple S- or higher games it wont matter. Of course you could also get honor capsules from being level 3 honor or higher but those are also given out pretty rarely. Also he mentions mastery crates and those take at a MINIMUM 50 games. AND ON TOP OF THE VERY LIMITED WAYS TO GET A DECENT AMOUNT OF BLUE ESSENCE IN THE SAME TIME YOU COULD GET A DECENT AMOUNT OF IP you are not guaranteed the value of champs in the capsules and you aren't guaranteed a champ that you don't own. SO, we could take most people's first experience with opening a level up capsule. For example, this player. (See post here: [](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/E2ldsxJV-champion-capsules-are-utter-trash)\n> So with first win bonus, seven wins (including first win) and four losses to equal a total of eleven games, I got rank 31, finally! What did I get?\n> I was happy to see I had five champion shards, because five champion shards means one perma-champion, right (no).\n> I got, Annie, Ashe, Mordekaiser, Poppy, Xin Zhao, so three 450 champions and two 1350 champions... Great.\n> After being disappointed in not being able to merge three shards into a random champion, I said hell to it and I looked at the disenchant price.\n> 90 - Annie\n> 90 - Ashe\n> 90 - Poppy\n> 270 - Morderkaiser\n> 270 - Xin Zhao\n> All added up for a total of... drumroll please!\n> 810 Blue Essence!\n> Back on IP I would have gotten\n> 300 from first win bonus\n> 80 from each match afterwards\n> 300+800 = 1100, which is already 290 more.\n(Just to interject, a 1350 champ costs 810 BE in shard form to turn into a permanent champ so you would make exactly enough to buy one of the 1350 champs he got. However in order to get enough for one of them he had to disenchant all the shards so yeah...)\n> Riot what the f~~uck~~, after 11 matches, with first win bonus, I would have at least have gotten enough to buy a 1350 champion by now.\n> I added up all of the minutes of the games (excluding seconds) to see how long reaching Level 31 took me. It took me 314 minutes which equates to 5 hours >14 minutes.\n> So let's see how long it would take to get each priced champion (note, due to how the system works, I'll be doing it stacking)\n> 5 Hours for 450 Champion\n> 10 Hours for 1350 Champion\n> 15 Hours for mystery champion shard (If they even exist)\n> 20 Hours for 3150 Champion\n> 30 Hours for 4800 Champion\n> 40 Hours for 6300 Champion\n>\n> With the IP system it took roughly 30 hours for 6300 Champion.\n> But wait, there's more!\n> As you level up, the experience required to level up increases! Great!\n> So those hours increase!\n>\n> EDIT (Made by original author)\n> I may add, getting five shards seems to be extremely lucky from what I see, some people are just left with a 90BE Shard.\n\nSo in conclusion, this new system is a piece of garbage system for the players and it's just a way for riot to make more money than they already do. IMO they can just make skins for champs that are highly played and I'm sure people will buy it. Plus you wouldn't even have to market them cause all the streamers would buy it and they would see it there so you can save even more money there. Honestly the only way they'll change this system is if people just stop buying RP all together but they know that won't happen.  The only rewards you can bet will be good are the level up capsules every 10 levels as far as I know starting at level 40. Otherwise GL HF with the new system and grinding forever to MAYBE get a champion you want.","replies":[]}]}
