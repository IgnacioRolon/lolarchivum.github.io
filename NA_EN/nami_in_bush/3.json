They can't have somebody be going 50-0 and rushing to end the game while they try to learn.\r\n\r\nIn customs they are unable to gain IP/XP which makes it difficult to buy champions and level up.\r\n\r\nAm I allowed to use their/my account on my computer to play bots games to get them some IP/XP? These accounts have 0 intention to be played in ranked, mostly just to play with family. They don't have time to play on their own in a CO-OP vs AI game. The only time they have is if it is after work and they can play with us, which doesn't gain them any IP/XP.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, I'm going to have to go into Co-Op vs AI games with them and have that one teammate that goes 50-0 and ends the game at 13 minutes.\r\n\r\nThey prefer just to play customs but then they can't play any champs except for the 10 champs they get for free before lvl 5 that never change.\r\n\r\nI don't want to break any ToS and get in trouble on my account, though.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo be clear it is their account, but I had assisted them in creating it because they've never made an account for a game before.","replies":[{"poster":"Wumbear","date":"2016-10-08T14:08:31.225+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ask some friends to join the bot games and kindly ask them to not interfere too much.

My dad managed to get enough IP for Master Yi and he already got a triple kill in bots once I showed him the power of Master Yi, what items to buy, and how to use his healing.\n\nMy mom tried Lissandra as her first champion, didn't go over too well. They still need allot of help. I think I'll enter them in bots games on their own and just sit next to them.\n\nI just don't want the game to be 10 minutes long and they never see an enemy champion because teammates are killing them out of fountain. It's very difficult to learn when the enemies cannot leave spawn.\n\nWhat champions should they play? How can I teach them better?","replies":[]},{"poster":"InTheory","date":"2016-10-07T22:03:30.052+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"A Horny Axsoowy","date":"2016-10-08T02:41:34.286+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No its just fun, I only have one pc and when my friends over we hop into norms and I teach him something and then we swap (I've been playing for 3-4 years he started few months ago) see if he learned and just have fun!  Account sharing is when 2 different pc's are being used and It could be thought of being boosted.
