All computers have their own identification. Same description as above but with using computer hardware in the stead of an IP. I have never personally have had my account breached, but I think there should be an extra security measure between having a password and being able to log on.\n\n Perhaps even an e-mail that says \"Hey, a new IP has accessed your account \"123.123.123\" is this you? If it is not, your account may be compromised. click here to lock your account and change your password\"\n\nMaybe follow the lead of Steam with an optional mobile authentication app.\n\nPerhaps even my original suggestion, but make it optional for account settings.\n\nI certainly would not want 2 years worth of time wasted on a game that I lose all the progress on. It'd be as bad as spending 2 years on a huge project in Minecraft or another building simulator, all to just have it deleted one day because of a hardware malfunction. It would **really** suck.","replies":[]}]}]}
