I am gonna take a break from this game.","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Miscellaneous","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am done with this game for now. Everyone gets one shotted even the tanks. Too many champions are too OP. If you lose early you lost cuz you cannot come back anymore. Even ARAM isn't funny anymore cuz it's always snowbally. I saw URF was coming back but it's ARURF. I get champions i never play that's one thing that sucks. If one team gets OP champions such as Evelynn, Zed, Karma and your team has 2 weak champions for urf such as Singed, Shyvana and other champions who cannot do anything against their poke you just automatically lost and the game snowballs so hard. So back to my question, can anyone recommend me a free to play game? I will probably only play the fun games modes from now on. That's the only thing i really enjoy atm.","replies":[{"poster":"Starcraft243ver","date":"2017-03-03T16:45:35.295+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wanna be the guy.","replies":[{"poster":"Lauchmelder","date":"2017-03-03T18:51:23.626+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wanna be the boshy","replies":[]},{"poster":"reaperteaser","date":"2017-03-03T18:50:39.031+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"llIllIllIllIll","date":"2017-03-05T02:20:05.462+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Most people bounce between Overwatch and League when the metas turn cancer\n_____________________________________________________________\n[Poll: What was the best season in League of Legends?](http://stepbystepguides.org/what-was-the-best-season-in-league-of-legends/)","replies":[]},{"poster":"EbonyBladeJ88","date":"2017-03-03T19:34:56.149+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you want to stay in the MOBA genre, then I suppose you can try DOTA 2, Heroes of the Storm, or even Smite.\n\nGot a Steam account?
