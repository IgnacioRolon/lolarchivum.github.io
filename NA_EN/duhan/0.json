It was shown as profanity due to the letters in the username. He was wondering if there was any way someone could manually set this as my username, if so that would be great! \r\n\r\nThank You","replies":[{"poster":"Psi21","date":"2017-05-01T05:30:10.313+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Original Poster is just using a new age term that is a variation of the N word.\nSound out the username and you will hear it.  They couldn't be more blatant with the capital letters.\n\nNote:   I don't have anything to gain from this ... just sick of seeing even my own kids pulling this immature garbage.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-30T03:10:00.247+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's odd.
