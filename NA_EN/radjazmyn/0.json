So basically, whenever I have played in a game (league only) my screen starts glitching out by randomly turning all black &amp; its been getting on my nerves &amp; sometimes will just stay blacked out so I have to leave &amp; try to get back in which has caused me to be put in low queue's &amp; people reporting me. I have asked so many people what to do &amp; they all just say its my graphics but it only happens if I play league! What worked for a bit was changing my language (who knows why) but then it goes back to doing it a few games later. I couldn't find anything that would help me. PLEASE SOMEONE HELP!\r\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}} {{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-03T01:10:39.541+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Most of the time when you lose your graphics entirely it's either caused by some weird issue with your graphics card or graphics drivers. Let's start troubleshooting this by making sure your graphics drivers are updated, but if that doesn't help be sure to go through the rest of the steps in this [**guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting) as well.
