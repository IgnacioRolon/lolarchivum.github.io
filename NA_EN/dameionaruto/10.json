Animated Icons. \r\n\r\nOf course for people who have computers that may not be able to handle it, you can toggle the animation off like one does for the main login screens. \r\nBut I feel these icons are simple enough to make animated icons, then maybe &quot;prestige&quot; versions of them.\r\n\r\nI came up with this idea because I played Shadowverse and Heartstone.  And some of the cards are slightly animated, but their cards are fully detailed characters like its holographic yugioh/pokemon cards. \r\n\r\nUltimately, I feel animated icons would be extremely rewarding when one cant purchase or pull the special skins that are in the same themes.  Also for the fact, that the collection has record of rarity for each icon, so it definitely makes it seem like a collection game, in a sense.  Animated Icons I feel would just be sooooooooo worth.\r\nThis is an example of animation i feel you guys could do for icons, Shadowverse-inspired:\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuYKDb7seG8","replies":[]}
