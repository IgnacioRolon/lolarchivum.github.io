He&#039;s one of the most balance champions riot has right now, but based on the league of legends lore and monkey king lore, wukong should be MORE fun to play.  Even in his lore with Master Yi (if we want to ignore his Journey to the West story lore), His actions are more reflected as a trickster and a fighter.\r\n\r\nRight now, you can &quot;try&quot; to play him as bruiser, but his cool downs are pretty long to even do an extend fight compared to ANY other Fighter champ. \r\nHe is the ONLY stealth champion that&#039;s not considered an assassin, yet build him Duskblade and go full damage, then he destroys every squishie IF the enemy had squishies and lackluster CC.\r\n\r\nthere are literally Items AND masteries with wukong&#039;s passive, and they are all better then his passive.  At the very least give him a better passive.\r\n\r\nThere are a few things wukong can do.  He can initiate/engage a teamfight with his ultimate, yet he&#039;s not tanky enough to survive after that quick knockup takes place, then while you are still spinning, they&#039;ll bust a full combo on you, bc your only does interrupt anything except the initial knockup.\r\n\r\nThe lore says wukong came from &quot;peaceful&quot; and wise clan, and wukong just so happen to have the heart for battle.  \r\nWukong also fought Master Yi and finally beat him with Stealth. \r\nAnd in the lore, he fought a group of people while in that same kind of stealth/smokescreen fought a group of people alone, and sustained a couple of &quot;punches to the face&quot; but still fought them through the smoke and all.\r\nFast and Dumb is a definite example in a league game where a wukong player sees an opportunity and decides to jump in and use ultimate, but he can&#039;t stealth unless he cancels his ultimate.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I just believe that Wukong deserves to be able to make for creative plays like the prankster/trickster he is.  \r\n\r\nIDEA: Make his clone do something with the magic it represents. Take a LeBlanc approach...... The clones uses the last ability wukong did when the enemy get close enough to the clone, but uses magic damage instead of physical damage. This makes really great trick plays against the enemy. \r\n\r\nIf you use his W clone it will do nothing but a spin when it runs out. Why not allow it to do a magic damage E ability or Q ability?  \r\n\r\nRemember at the very minimum: update Wukong&#039;s passive to something else.","replies":[{"poster":"saltran","date":"2018-02-11T00:10:24.323+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"I didn't even read and I don't play Wu.\n\nBut Wukong needs a rework like Xin Zao or even a full rework.","replies":[{"poster":"Full Tank Jesus","date":"2018-02-11T00:48:47.557+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you didn't read his opinion then you don't deserve one.
