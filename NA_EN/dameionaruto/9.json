I understand Riot needs to make money too, but does it not make sense to give some skins to other champs, especially these new champs.\r\nBecause these new champs are technically getting played often enough to have people want to see them in skins.  \r\n\r\nAlso, quite honestly I&#039;ve heard from many players that they would play champs more if they had cooler/newer skins.\r\n\r\nNot saying the skins coming out are not cool, just saying the SAME champs are getting the cool skins. Even Taliyah makes splashes in high elo and professional scenes, but she only has SSG skin and the default released 2nd skin.\r\n\r\nOverall, Riot, please don&#039;t be afraid to create some skins on these other champs with less/older skins. People WILL drop that money for these skins as long as you put them out there lol it&#039;s all aesthetics, after all.","replies":[]}
