I've been very careful to avoid decay, but today when I logged in I was demoted from Plat 5 to Gold 1. I haven't played any ranked games for a week. Let me make this clear, I logged in and then BAM message saying \"Demoted to Gold 1\". Any ideas why this is happened?","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2014-09-30T05:42:28.604+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Rule 29!\n\nIt appears that you got the wrong error message!  You were demoted back down into Gold 1, but this was not due to decay at all but due to losing games.  It appears that you lost a game dropping you to 1 LP, then you lost another to drop you to 0 LP, and then you lost a 3rd in a row which prompted a demotion to Gold 1.\n\nYou should have received a normal notification explaining that you were demoted, but instead you got the wrong one stating inactivity as the reason.  I'm really sorry for the confusion regarding your games!","replies":[{"poster":"hands0m","date":"2014-10-07T18:13:01.973+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good Afternoon Dartagnan,\n\nI don't want to go against the forums rules or be \"spamming\" riot employees, however there is several \"attempting to reconnect/Ping@500\" threads being made on the Bugs boards and Help & support Boards.
