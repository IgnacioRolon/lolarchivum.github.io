Whenever you guys switch to the new client I won't be able to play on it, because I have a small resolution screen. I know you guys added a settings button to the client but whenever I try and drag it over it cuts of the whole friend's list and that part. I've been trying to figure out a way for it to not cut off for it to not do that, but I have been unsuccessful. Could you guys maybe consider moving the settings button or could i get some help on how to fix if, if there is one?\r\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-rainbows}}","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-10T17:52:41.089+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If I understand correctly, your client is oversized.  Try tapping Ctrl + Down Arrow on your keyboard to adjust that.
