I have had the issue happen to me 3 times now, the first one wasn't really an issue because i just reset the password. The second one however i was not able to just reset my password and just figured it was some mishap because i had to sent in a ticket and it was taken care of immediately. Now, I have been hacked and i believe my email has been because the password reset was not there and there were a few emails missing. I have since changed the email in question and requested my account back. However the support who is supposed to help me refuses me at every corner. I recently sent in the previous ticket that allowed my account to be recovered, yet i have still yet to be given my account back or even heard back at all. So, I would like to ask Riot to help me recover my account because it is honestly frustrating that after 5-6 years of playing League and spending lots of money on it that i would have to restart       because both the security wasn't adequate enough and now the support is brushing me off. I honestly believe that if the issue persists that i would not continue to play the game and take my business elsewhere. I would love to be able to continue playing league, but if i don't get the account back then i don't believe their support or security is enough.","replies":[{"poster":"SpikedB","date":"2016-07-19T12:07:38.314+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have taken the right precautions. The first time my account was what i believe to be hacked. It could still have been nothing. I had no email to reset my password it just stopped working one day, so i didnt think anything of it and just reset it.  The second time i had an email for the reset and it did not work so I changed my password on my email and my riot. No one else has access to either. This is the third time and this time my email has even been hacked as i noticed missing emails and my password does not work. I have requested my account back and my email to the account be changed, and  I have provided information that no one else could have.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-20T20:49:34.424+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Account information and security is important, so we won't be able to discuss this on the boards.

Riot provides multiple levels of account protection through hiding your email, your account name, and your password; when a player fails to keep them safe they may be held accountable for any actions taken on the account. The security leak is not on Riot's end.\n\nWhen you get it take once that's bad, but Riot will try to help if you're the account owner. When you get it stolen 3 times, it's suspicious in the sense that you may not be the owner of the account or you are willingly sharing your login information, and that is why they stop recovering it for you.\n\nBasically, you need to take sufficient steps on your end to prevent this from happening, but it doesn't look like you are. I suggest visiting the following article for guidelines on keeping your account safe;\n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751664-Protecting-Your-Account","replies":[]}]}
