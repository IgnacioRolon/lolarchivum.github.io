Which Region should I play?","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello everyone, first time posting to the board. I'm deployed right now, in Kosovo, with good Wifi. I'm sure me disconnecting some games is due to the fact the new patch is up and running. I have an account in the North American server of course, and I'm wondering if anyone knows when the transfers will be available and what time. Also, I want to play in either EUW or EU Nordic. Which one","replies":[{"poster":"Milisava","date":"2016-11-09T14:34:49.454+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello! \n\nI don't know about when will transfer be available, probably soon!\nBut as me wanting to transfer to NA from EUNE, I have played on the three servers: NA, EUW and EUNE for a while and could tell you pros and cons of each. Please note that I don't want to start the \"server wars\" here. So here goes:\n\nEUNE: Less challenging ranked games until you advance higher than gold 3 in terms of strategy, but more challenging in terms of carrying game yourself.   Be prepared to read a lot of languages other than English, and sadly most people speaking them not wishing you a good day either!\n\nEUW: The overall challenge of ranked games goes up a few bars, where I found that what is considered silver 2 in EUNE is bronze 3 in EUW, so in general (NOT speaking individually) the player base seems like a tougher challenge. Still be prepared for language diversity and most of them not wishing you Merry Christmas either!\n\nEUNE/EUW: Both servers in my opinion are equal in terms of players and game progress but only after certain point, and for me that point would be in higher gold tires. I've truly seen the worst and the best of both servers, and it can be pretty amazing or pretty meh. Know that the ping slightly differs if you play on EUW from Kosovo, but not much, probably higher by 15-20. \n\nAnd for the end, general server lag on both EUW and EUNE is something that you'll take time to get used to, because it can be pretty common comparing to NA server. But I've noticed less server lag on EUNE than on EUW, and for me that can impact a game a lot.\n\nHope I helped you a bit and good luck! No matter what server you choose, its your skill that matters!","replies":[{"poster":"Dantuku Feja","date":"2016-11-10T07:06:52.963+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"and you are basing your information on what?\n\nyour data is extremely lacking and unsupported.\n\ninfact, you can realise how wrong you are by going onto op.gg and checking the mmr estimate of each division, against each region.\n\nthere is little to infact, no difference in mmr between EUNE and EUW, nor for NA. your statements are completely false and unaccounted.\n\nand another side note, the player population at the rank you are currently playing at is immense so the data you obtain from your dozen games is almost negligible on the grand scale.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-09T22:19:57.701+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not sure when transfers will be available again, but it's possible they won't be enabled until *after* ranked rewards distribution has concluded.
