Jinx's lore is based on the fact that she single-handedly turned at least parts of Piltover to crime after staying uncaught and destroying stuff all over the place. At the same time proving that the Cait and Vi duo wasn't nearly as invincible as they seemed. That's a pretty darn major change. I also disagree that Jinx wouldn't pick out major targets in a town like Piltover where people like Ziggs exist, especially if it's going to piss off the cop duo. Might not necessarily kill them, but i'm fairly certain a few of them might get traumas from her thieving heists.\n\nOn the other hand while Jhin as an assassin probably does pick more relevant targets, he's still currently being used and being backed by an organization that likely helps him reach said targets.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GhostOfShrimpmas","date":"2016-04-24T19:02:11.711+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=WAAARGHbobo,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=xbXZN8Ue,comment-id=0018,timestamp=2016-04-24T04:47:43.585+0000)\n>\n> Jhin might kill only 4 people --\n\nBeautiful.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Stars Shaper","date":"2016-04-24T15:50:15.130+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Would Jhin refuse to kill some1 if he/she doesn't inspire him?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Halodjin Tyr","date":"2016-04-24T13:01:12.301+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=WAAARGHbobo,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=xbXZN8Ue,comment-id=0018,timestamp=2016-04-24T04:47:43.585+0000)\n>\n> Depends on what you mean by &quot;dangerous.&quot;\n> \n> Jinx has probably killed more people and destroyed more stuff....
