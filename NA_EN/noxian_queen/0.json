After the match I got a 14 day suspension for “int’ing” but if you look at my match history that’s the only game I haven’t tried and haven’t “int’ed“ before is there a way I can get my suspension appealed?","replies":[{"poster":"Arcade Lulu","date":"2020-01-11T19:26:18.329+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"You do know that account sharing is a perma bannable offense, right\n\nSomeone who was last season gold 3 going 0/11/0 with 21 cs in a 18 min game really does look like inting\n\nTbh your punishment was 100% justified. Doesn't matter if it was you or your girlfriend, still ruined the game for 4 other people","replies":[]},{"poster":"Prandine","date":"2020-01-11T20:09:56.629+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Your first mistake was account sharing, as that's against the rules and is a bannable offense. If she really wanted to play she should've just made her own account to do so rather than use yours. Your second mistake was letting her play in normals as opposed to the training tool or a custom bot game, like really, what were you expecting to have happen by thrusting her into pvp with no prior game knowledge beforehand? Sorry to say but that's all on you buddy. You should feel lucky that you didn't get a permaban for this mistake.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Merrilin","date":"2020-01-11T19:41:31.441+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not justified.\n\nShould have been a perma ban.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2020-01-11T19:37:15.647+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Should have tried bots out first.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ehhhh","date":"2020-01-11T19:28:16.234+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well you can make her an account of her own since its free. Therefore you won't be banned for account sharing. Theres not much you can do, since you shouldnt be letting other people play on your account anyway. Especially if it was against other people, even though you know she knows nothing of the game in the first place","replies":[]},{"poster":"RektBishOpSpade","date":"2020-01-12T14:23:49.439+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, now she can make an account, learn the game, and by the time you get your's back, she'll have some good footing in. Also, be careful while that's on your record. I've read a lot of PB threads about how easy it was for all of them to get a perm from having just gotten a 14 day thing. I suggest not to try to get it appealed, especially with the details you've provided. Just wait it out, its only two weeks.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Upgrades","date":"2020-01-12T13:02:36.012+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You should of went into a custom game with 9 bots.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2020-01-12T01:30:53.658+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Inting is punishable whether you pretend that someone else was at the keyboard or not.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Arammus","date":"2020-01-12T01:24:55.241+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"rip relationship lol.\nnext time go into a game vs ai. i bet noone will complain in there as the 4 others on your team will be bots aswell LOL","replies":[]}]}
