To start, I suggest using the [game crash](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes+) guide to update your drivers and tune up your PC.  You can also use the [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) to repair your game files, included in that guide.  Usually, the patcher should detect a bad game file (or sound file), but a repair will make sure it gets picked up.  I hope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"RinBuizu","date":"2017-04-26T18:40:43.566+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the answer. I have followed most of your steps but it's too late for me to play another game long enough to be sure to encounter that issue - or not encounter it. I will tell you tomorrow if it worked.","replies":[]}]}]}
