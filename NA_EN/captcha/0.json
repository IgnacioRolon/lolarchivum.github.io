Also, by smiting krugs, the smite cooldown will be up by the time shaco reaches blue =). The disadvantages are that your first clear becomes a little bit slower meaning your first buff could get countered by the enemy jungler (if he comes to counter) and you wont have smite to safely secure the buff.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ark Angel HFB","date":"2015-03-14T11:27:23.533+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Look I respect the work you put into this... but I really find both of the best paths for Shaco start with red buff alone.\n\n1.

I meant hop the dragon/baron wall from your red and show up at the enemy blue. With the proper runes and masteries you will be there very fast.\n\nNormally, and yes this does depend on a few things, the enemy will ether NOT be to his blue in time to stop you... or will have done grump and will be smite-less half way through his blue. It is very easy to smite the blue away, but don't stop there. If the enemy is low fight him, but more importantly take the two small minions at the blue camp that will be low from the enemy grump buff.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"biomaster","date":"2015-03-14T15:47:58.623+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Interesting, I main shaco top so I've never gotten around to learning how to jungle with him, specially sense the new jungle hurts so much.","replies":[{"poster":"Captcha","date":"2015-03-14T23:10:00.245+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=biomaster,realm=NA,application-id=WEuoGbmp,discussion-id=UfGWyVIa,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-03-14T15:47:58.623+0000)\n>\n> Interesting, I main shaco top so I've never gotten around to learning how to jungle with him, specially sense the new jungle hurts so much.\n\nShaco still manages very well to go trough the jungle as his boxes tank for him, and his shiv makes the monster miss their attacks on him","replies":[]}]}]}
