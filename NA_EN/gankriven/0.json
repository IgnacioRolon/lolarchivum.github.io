Looking into this for you, I saw that your previous S games with Riven were around May 21st.  During this time, there was a widespread issue where tokens were not dropping, and we had a support ticker on this available [here](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/208872326--May-20-We-re-aware-of-an-issue-that-occasionally-prevents-mastery-token-drops-We-re-aiming-to-resolve-this-in-patch-6-11):\n\n> [MAY 20] WE'RE AWARE OF AN ISSUE THAT OCCASIONALLY PREVENTS MASTERY TOKEN DROPS. WE'RE AIMING TO RESOLVE THIS IN PATCH 6.11\n\nLooking further into this, I don't see any previous history of the account having a token beyond the 1 you currently have.  It would be necessary to play another game and earn an S to receive the last necessary token.\n\nWe'd be happy to provide more specific information if you'd, just hit us up in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) for that.  Otherwise, I hope that helps clear things up, and good luck!","replies":[{"poster":"GankRiven","date":"2016-08-25T20:42:19.353+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"right after i got the s token i was suspended. im sure if i send in a support ticket i will only receive a copy paste response, but per your orders i will.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-25T20:46:18.212+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The suggestion for a ticket was only if you needed more specifics, like dates or timelines.
