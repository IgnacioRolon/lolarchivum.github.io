It might be that your friends were able to get more honors or played more games.","replies":[{"poster":"IFadi","date":"2017-10-29T05:54:42.889+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"look over my account too babe?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-29T20:36:56.510+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well I couldn't rightly ignore someone calling me babe xD!\n\nI checked up on yours, and you're still at level 2 and gain in honor and the normal pace. Do keep in mind that certain mildly toxic behavior may not get you punished, but it could still slow down your honor exp.","replies":[{"poster":"Vènatus","date":"2018-01-31T05:01:53.698+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been playing since 2016 and I'm still stuck at honor 2 checkpoint 1, its been like getting the key fragments 10 times","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dropudellerfeed","date":"2017-11-07T20:17:45.122+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please check mine aswell.. my friend who barely plays is at honor level 4, I keep playing 2-3 games a day and are still stuck at lvl 2.

Denying someone an honor puts you down for honor points which could potentially level you up in the honor system, hope that helps.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hexorcism","date":"2017-09-03T09:53:17.848+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes something that shows if you make progress or not would be really helpful. I finally got honour level 3 yesterday but I don't know why because I did not receive any honor votes yesterday so I wasn't expecting to get honor level 3.

I play with a friend of mine and we both get almost the same amount of honor. We play everyday and he got honor level 4 last week. Im still stuck in honor level 2. I don't know if im going to progress at any time soon or anything like this. It just makes me hate the game where i dont even get anything for playing good and not flaming.","replies":[]}]}
