I say \"might have\" because whoever managed to change my password also managed to change my email, but I know people that play at all kinds of different hours and they never saw me online without being in some kind of voice chat. As far as I can tell they never logged in.\n\nJust a few min ago, I got an email attempting to recover my account.... which I clearly am not trying to do. When they got me last time, my email was never opened, so they got access to my in game without access to my email. How do I stop this from happening?\n\nEDIT: Yes I am using a different password and email now, and I changed everything after both AVG and Malware Bytes confirmed I had no malware.\n\nEDIT 2: Why are the only things I can do security wise verify email, change email, and change password? Not even security questions.","replies":[{"poster":"Dark Morgana","date":"2017-06-06T17:53:36.318+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds like you've had a rough ride with that account, but you took all the necessary precautions to keep your account secure!
