It's not an \"easy\" role by any means. Not extremely hard to learn no, but if you're up in challenger or diamond or something you're going to get absolutely destroyed by the REAL support main you're fighting instead of you who's \"learned\" support over 20 games and thought you had nothing to worry about. \n\nOn my most recent support ranked game (Sona going 0/5/21) I had less gold than the entire enemy team the whole game. I had 4,000+ less gold at the end of the game when we WON than their highest gold member. If you're not used to the role and you're used to mid, or top, or support or jungle. You're going to be working off far less items than usual, with far less power than usual, and far more jobs to do. (Except maybe Jungle he might be more busy than you) \n\n I'm not sure where this opinion is coming from that support \"as a role itself isn't even that hard\" since you appear to be a midlaner based on your literal entire ranked history ever. But the role is difficult enough that any new person just taking the advice of \"Don't get caught out and peel for people\" is still going to get curb stomped by an actual support main. \n\nAlso the main problem with new support players and warding is they just forget. Unless you've got a hell of a lot of support games you're probably just not going to remember to use your sightstone cause it's just not something you normally do in any other role.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Narvuntien","date":"2017-04-15T18:05:33.834+0000","up_votes":26,"down_votes":5,"body":"People need to learn to play support....\n\nAlthough to be fair if I ever got autofilled to top lane I'd be in big trouble... *hides under tower whille lane opponent gets massively farmed*","replies":[{"poster":"Jabbabax","date":"2017-04-15T19:11:30.792+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same here except with adc.
