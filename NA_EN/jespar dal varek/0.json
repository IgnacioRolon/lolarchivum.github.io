The problem is, I don't get a single chance to get it back no matter what and I think there is other gamers who also has the same issue.\r\n\r\nI think Riot should consider to set some new rules regarding the banned accounts throughout all servers and I might have an idea for it.\r\n\r\n- If one of your account has been banned since a certain number of years, you might get the chance to get it back by paying 100$ Riot points.\r\n\r\n- You write the summoners name you want to unban, and that's it... But it doesn't stop there. Also, you might not have a second chance to unban it twice (200$) or it would be rediculous obviously.\r\n\r\n- Once you unban your very old account, you cannot play Rankeds for the next 30 days (OR) --optional-- You will have the responsability to unluck the honor stuff which could be a pain in the a$$ u'know hehe.\r\n\r\n- You get ONE single report of negative attitude or AFK and you are gone for garbage for sur.\r\n\r\nConclusion: You pay to get your account back, but if your attitude hasn't changed much after all the number of years, you get REban once and for all and no more unban stuff. You will need to wait 30 day's before getting back into Rankeds OR unlock the honor medal.\r\n\r\nGimme your thoughts about it plz.","replies":[{"poster":"rujitra","date":"2020-03-01T00:54:43.830+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, it will never be a good idea to have a \"pay to avoid the rules\" situation.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightsky Pirate","date":"2020-03-01T19:14:44.338+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To some unofficial extent, that's how the real world works.

Riot is not going to let toxic players buy their way back in to ruin games for everyone else.
