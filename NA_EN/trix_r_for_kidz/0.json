First post ever. Never had any major issues with League ever, but all of a sudden I seem to be dropping packets. I have 60 fps, great ping, but my champion randomly stops moving and i can't control him. How can I troubleshoot this issue? I just reinstalled the client entirely and that didn't work. I've only started experiencing this on 7.24. \r\n\r\nI should also mention this is happening to a few of my other friends as well, 3 of us in total. We all live in different areas of the country. Would appreciate a reply.\r\n\r\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-22T03:26:15.229+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since you're already running that traceroute to check and see if this is actually packet loss or not, go ahead and post those results so I can take a look to see what's going on!","replies":[{"poster":"Trix r for kidz","date":"2017-12-22T03:46:59.654+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Doesn't seem to have any issues when I run it. \n\n\n1     1 ms    <1 ms    <1 ms  192.168.1.1\n  2     9 ms     9 ms    17 ms  96.120.24.61\n  3     8 ms     9 ms    21 ms  162.151.161.189\n  4    12 ms    12 ms    11 ms  be-173-ar01.area4.il.chicago.comcast.net [69.139.202.169]\n  5    24 ms    18 ms    17 ms  be-33491-cr02.350ecermak.il.ibone.comcast.net [68.86.91.165]\n  6    11 ms    16 ms    10 ms  be-10577-pe03.350ecermak.il.ibone.comcast.net [68.86.86.2]\n  7    14 ms    11 ms    20 ms  104.160.131.1","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-22T04:03:05.381+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's a little hard to tell if I'm reading that trace correctly without the headers (some display the info a little differently) but it doesn't really look like there's any packet loss going on here tbh. With that being said, I'm a little curious if your previous games had packet loss but currently your connection is fine.\n\nSince this doesn't actually seem to be related to packet loss right now, it's pretty likely that it's an issue with improperly working game files or just a simple connection-based problem. Check out the steps in the [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to make sure nothing is blocking your connection. \n\nIf you start to see something that looks like packet loss again, immediately after that game run another trace and send me those results. Alternatively, you can take your network logs from that match and have this [**log reader**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743) scan them for you.","replies":[{"poster":"Trix r for kidz","date":"2017-12-22T05:11:32.351+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah well I did a clean uninstall/reinstall.. So how could it be related to game files? \n\nIt feels almost ISP related and I have insanely good internet. I've never had any issues ever, and there seems to be multiple people having this issue. I understand this doesn't show the issue, I ran it out of game in the CMD line. So it isn't going to show anything, it just happens randomly and it's still happening. Feels bad. Maybe line related?","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Jax Yas Shaco","date":"2017-12-22T01:32:54.677+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I also am having this issue","replies":[{"poster":"Trix r for kidz","date":"2017-12-22T01:40:26.092+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm.

Sometimes it's also accompanied with everything else freezing and then randomly coming back. Then it will have the summoner has returned text. Generally it'll happen once every five or so minutes.

Went into the settings and it said they were enabled, so I continued playing. 4 minutes later league froze and I waited 10 minutes to unfreeze, nothing happened. So I restarted my computer and opened up league, and it said \"Game is still in progress\" but it didnt connect me back to the game. \"reconnect\" was nowhere on my screen. While I am typing this game is still in progress and I am about to get a low priority queue, 20 minute wait for 5 games for absolutely nothing. #1 how do I fix this #2 can I not get the low priority queue for this pls","replies":[]}]}
