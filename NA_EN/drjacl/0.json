Even though I have all of the 450 champions, all of the 1350 champions, and a few of the upper tier ones (I think I have around 5 or 6 6300s, probably around 10 or so of the others) I still need over 400,000 IP to get the rest. I plan to  play a lot this summer, but even if I play 3 games a day for each of those 12 weeks, averaging 82 IP per game (The average amount for a 35 min game, assuming a 50% win rate), and get first win every day, I will only get 35,000 IP. I may play more, but even so, I will barely make a dent in being able to buy all of the champions. \r\n\r\nThis seems to me to be discouraging to new players and also exclusionary to those who have played the game for a long time but still haven't been able to unlock all champions. Given that I don't have money to be buying constantly with RP, I wanted to put this up for the community. There would seem to be relatively simple solutions, however. Perhaps a bigger First Win bonus to reward those who consistently return, bigger rewards in Hextech Crafting, a large-scale champion price reduction or, my favorite idea, having champions go on sale for reduced IP costs. In any case, I think the system needs to be looked at. What does everyone think?","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-05-31T21:20:10.271+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can definitely get where you are coming from, especially those who are collectors and want to make sure they are able to unlock everything.  As you said though, unless you have been playing for a long time, bought a lot of boosts, or bought a lot of RP, it takes a while to accumulate all the champions.  My best recommendation would be to really focus on a role that you enjoy, whether Jungle, mid, etc.  From there, focus using your IP on those champions and slowly build out your champion pools per role.  The Free To Play Rotation should also help in letting you try out new champions or other roles you may want to invest in for the future.\n\nOn top of all that, don't forget about Hextech Crafting!  By playing games you'll also possibly unlock the chance to earn new champions as well to add to your collection.\n\nI hope this helps somewhat regarding some advice!  Let me know if you have any other questions!","replies":[{"poster":"DrJaCL","date":"2016-05-31T22:33:24.335+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While I understand your reasoning, I don't think the solution to this problem is simply \"Buy the champs/role you want first.\" No matter where you start, the point is that it will take forever to get even most of the champions, and even if I were to follow your advice, I would be specializing myself into a role that I may grow tired of. \n\nMy main issue is that it seems that there are two bad choices under the current champion system; select a particular role, gain a good champion pool in that role, and thus essentially lock yourself into said role (particularly tricky for new players, who, as I have, often start out at support) or try to diversify roles, and thus end up with an unsatisfactory champion pool at all five roles. \n\nThe reality is that I can either suffer through having a poor champion pool or suffer through the grind necessary to acquire lots of champions. Any system that has only two outcomes, both long and painful, should be changed. That's what I am hopeful for.","replies":[{"poster":"M Dragon14","date":"2016-06-01T12:30:45.862+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't see an issue with picking a particular role you like, and increasing your champ pool from there. That's what most of us did. If you're worried about not having all roles covered, just pick 2-3 champs for each roll, and in many cases, champs can be flex picks (ex: lulu can top, mid, AND support! A 3 in one!). And, if you play ranked, you only need to cover 2 roles. \n\nWhen I first started playing, it only took me like 4 or 5 months to have a solid champ pool (3-4 champs) for my main roll (which was top at the time), and at least 2 champs for all the other rolls. Hell, I'm not even sure newer players can even handle having that large of a champ pool, and play a champ pool of 15 or more at a decent level..... Learning to just play league (the items, champs, strats, ect) takes long enough. Unless you're experienced in mobas, I'd say most new players wouldn't be able to handle a large champ pool..... With this system as it is, it forces new players to pick a champ, learn it, then when they have enough IP, buy another, learn it, rinse and repeat.\n\n> The reality is that I can either suffer through having a poor champion pool or suffer through the grind necessary to acquire lots of champions\n\n\nAre you saying that simply playing the game is \"suffering through the grind\"? If that's the case, maybe League isn't for you. If you're not having fun playing the game, then whats the point?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Quepha","date":"2016-05-31T21:32:31.617+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=dArtagnan,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=LwvEyAUy,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-05-31T21:20:10.271+0000)\n>\n> On top of all that, don&#x27;t forget about Hextech Crafting!

Assuming you unlock every possible chest you can, which requires a higher number games played than average, you still only unlock one champion from the system about every 2 months or longer, and that champion isn't even one that you've directly chosen. That is a drop in the bucket.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ZhenLaJi","date":"2016-05-31T23:47:14.994+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a player with all the champions (playing since season 2), I can say to you that you will have a bunch of champion that you will play once every few months. Yes, that is right. You will grow to like some champion and those will make up your pool of champions to select from when you play. Since you only play about 3 games a day, you can pretty much test out the champions when they become free and decide to buy the ones you like.","replies":[{"poster":"Herny knock down","date":"2016-06-01T00:26:06.780+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Totally agree .

Sure, champion pool is a bit restricted, but you can get any one or several champions you think are powerful/fun without any disadvantage.\n\nI remember when buying 6300 IP champion felt like a big decision to me... but by now I have more IP than I can usefully spend, even though I don't own all the champions, I have all the 450 and 1350 IP ones,  plus all the ones I wanted to play in ranked. The turn around from if-I-get-more-IP-I-will-buy-this-champion-I-really-want to I-have-more-IP-than-I-want-to-spend came quicker than I would anticipate initially. I have not spent a cent on in-game advantage purchase (I did buy RP for skins, but I'm not spending real money on in game advantage as a matter of principle), and after about first year of play I felt I have IP for pretty much anything I want.\n\nSo I would say buy champions you want to play in ranked, or ones you really enjoy, try other ones during your free week, and you will probably feel few constraints shortly. Much better than lots of other \"free to play\" games where spending money or tons of time grinding gives you an actual game play advantage.","replies":[]},{"poster":"linydna5555","date":"2017-03-10T02:40:08.684+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yea i dont think its fair..","replies":[]},{"poster":"Imainleblancguys","date":"2016-09-18T01:28:42.468+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been playing since s3 and I never had the time to play over 5 games everyday or so, I still had around 65% of them champions all from IP (Never bought with RP except once in the sale day, from starter RP you get when creating an account), and that's why I think LoL has the most frustrating gameplay to get all champions, diversity is a nice thing, specially for hardcore gamers, since s3 to this day I couldn't get all the champions, we're talking about a timeline of over 4 years .....

I only have 70 or 80 champions unlocked and while I have a stupid amount of IP sitting around, I still won't use it to unlock the remaining ones, because I don't care about them.\n\nAt the end of the day, you can only play one champion at a time anyway, having hundreds new toys is bit silly you won't even have the time to use 'em all, better focus on the ones you like.\n\nAnd if you really want that new toy asap, you might as well save yourself some time and make yourself a favor and buy it with RP.","replies":[{"poster":"M Dragon14","date":"2016-06-01T12:13:28.411+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's how I was for awhile xD.
