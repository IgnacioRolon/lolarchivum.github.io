This morning I could play just fine, and now it gives either the screen as shown above, or it doesn't authenticate at all. \nI ran the HRT, \nreset the modem\nrebooted my computer\nHaven't changed any settings since this morning, and windows didn't update between then and now. Firewall exceptions are up for LoL.\nStill the same, LoL tries to log in forever and then fails.","replies":[]}]}]}
