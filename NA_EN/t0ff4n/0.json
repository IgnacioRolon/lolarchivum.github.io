Patch notes and the client splashes may show new content, but it doesn't mean that it will show up on the first day.  Rewards, for example, still need to be distributed per the help desk thread. It's going to take time to send them out to every eligible player so while we can estimate we can't offer a specific date.  \n\nKeep an eye on our [News](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/) page as well for the other skins once they're ready to roll out.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Xaeros","date":"2017-11-10T23:03:46.824+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"T0ff4n!\n\nThe best place to get info on the season rewards is probably the [2017 Ranked Rewards Help Desk]( https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-support/W0aEONuP-2017-ranked-rewards-help-desk).\n\n>**REWARD DISTRIBUTION**\n\n>All rewards will be distributed in the coming months after the end of season.

What I asked is why the patch notes stated the skin would be available on release of 7.22 and it shows it in champ select but is not accessible. Im sorry you struggled so hard with my question. If you managed to reread it would you like to try and answer it again?","replies":[{"poster":"Xaeros","date":"2017-11-10T23:33:03.651+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey T0ff4n,\n\nSorry that my original answer wasn't satisfactory.\n\nFrom the [Patch 7.22 notes](https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-722-notes#patch-upcoming-skins-and-chromas):\n\n>**The following skins will be released in patch 7.22**:\n\n>Mecha Rengar\n>Victorious Graves (Gold+ Ranked Reward)\n>Lancer Rogue Blitzcrank\n>Lancer Paragon Blitzcrank\n\nPlease note that the phrasing is \"**in** patch 7.22\", which means that the skins will be \"unlocked\" sometime during Patch 7.22, before Patch 7.23+.\n\nThis is actually very common in League patches. Content that is included in a patch is not always available the day the patch goes live, but rather unlocked sometime during that patch. You can commonly see skins show up with a new patch that are not selectable or purchasable immediately.\n\nIf you _really_ want to get into reasons why things are sometimes done this way, you can read up on things like [Continuous Delivery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery) and [Feature Toggling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_toggle).","replies":[{"poster":"T0ff4n","date":"2017-11-11T00:16:48.928+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"Thats much better answer thanks. I guess I forgot how unqualified a lot of staff are at Riot. They have released thousands of skins yet still somehow struggle to release content the same way they always do same with seven years of ranked seasons now and STILL cannot even find out a method of communicating their incompetence. I guess I should have known when I click the ! Icon in the client it is just chock full of rookie mistakes and known issues. Im just used to much better run companies with games, thats all.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
