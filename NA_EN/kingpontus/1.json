I checked my wifi and everything and it was fine and connected to the internet. I'm on an Ethernet connection so I don't even have to deal with wifi. So I'm like wtf. I wait like 20 seconds and it doesn't change. So I try to exit and come back into the game and it just brings me to the home page like I wasn't even in the middle of the game. So idk whats wrong but something is definitely wrong. please fixxx because if I get a penalty for doing nothing wrong it's not going to be alright.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-16T02:37:13.136+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmmm it almost sounds like you encountered what we call a ghost game. Essentially, that specific match might have ran into some error that caused the entire game to crash for everyone. When that happens, nobody will be able to reconnect because the game was never saved. No worries if it was in fact a ghost game. Since the server doesn't realize the match ever happened, nobody should be punished for it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FingleMyTingle","date":"2017-05-16T02:30:20.123+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have the same issue! \nAlso I don't know if you are experiencing the same high levels of ping and the slow process of the client reacting.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Komyx1ner","date":"2017-05-16T02:29:54.520+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"yea the same thing happened to me twice today.","replies":[]}]}
