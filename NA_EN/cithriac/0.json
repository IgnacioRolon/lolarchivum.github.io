I also am trying to load a bot game and the same thing occured. When the game ends the black screen freezes so you have to force quit it, then the game end chat place opens up/if it is a bot game it just sends you back to the main league page.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-28T23:36:00.496+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This situation usually happens when there's an unstable connection between your client and the game server. Sometimes this can be bypassed by spamming the **RETURN** or **ENTER** key on your keyboard as the loading screen pops up. \n\nIn most cases, local network settings are causing the issue, so I recommend working through the solutions listed in our [Mac Connection Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#section-mac). Let me know if those steps resolved the issue.","replies":[]}]}
