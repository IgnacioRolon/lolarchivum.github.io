I checked a thread already about this that was posted a while ago and it seemed like a lot of people were having problems with league after updating and the Rioter reply to that was posted a while ago as well. So is there any update on this? Should it work normally now that its been out for a bit? Or will it still be glitchy?

Riot Games should just fire whoever is making these ports to OS X. Other games haven't been patched for years and they don't get retarded bugs like this whenever there is a new OS X version.
