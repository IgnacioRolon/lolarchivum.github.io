It's not possible to go from level 4 to 5 mastery while *also* earning a token. The message you receive when you hit level 5 is meant to let you know that you can *now* start earning tokens, it was not meant to mean you *did * just earn a token.\n\nHope this helped. Let me know if you have any other questions.","replies":[]}]}
