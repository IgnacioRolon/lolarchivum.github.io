A little overwhelmed, you start exploring. By the time you reach an inhib turret, you're most likely already being spam pinged and yelled at in chat for \"taking my lane\". \nThen you get to pvp and you don't really get to learn. There's a really good chance that you're with/against people who've played before (people who got banned or smurfs), and theyll yell at you for any non optimal thing you're doing. \n\nIf they dont fix the new player experience, I doubt toxicity will start die anywhere else.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Saezio","date":"2018-09-23T17:21:16.060+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Today a fiora stomped me in lane (i was gp and she was like 25 cs and a kill ahead) I played like a kitty and had to get mid and jungle help to chase and kill her in jungle 2 times. Didn't say anything like \"OMG bring more\" \"win lane lose game\" \"better mid/jg wins\". I say that is a pretty sportsmanlike person, not a single bs in the all chat when she deserved to win the game much more than I did.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Aneirin","date":"2018-09-24T01:09:59.259+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I only play a couple of times a week, but I'd have someone cool in my team more often than not.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Telephone Booth","date":"2018-09-23T22:49:01.899+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are those who still think honor and respect is important. Not riots version of honor, i mean real honor. Those people are usually silent though because honor and respect is treated as some sort of uncool fucking snowflake trait.
