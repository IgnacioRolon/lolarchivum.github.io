Yi and Shyvana with their on-hits, and Kayle because she can go invulnerable for 3 seconds and able to do too much damage with the item.\n\nI think this specific \"power-up\" portion should be reworked to something useful, but not as strong. It synergizes too well not only with some champion kits that are incredibly unfun to play against, such as the previously mentioned Yi, Shyvana and Kayle, but also with {{item:3153}} and, honestly, the item by itself is already strong without any other interactions.\n\nIt's a creative mechanic and I applaud Riot's attempt to make it an useful item and bring life back to many forgotten junglers, and get rid of infinite scaling Feral Flare-style items. However the interaction with on-hits is simply too strong, the item alone will give you 180 magic damage every 2 autoattacks, so an average of 90 on hit-magic damage - which is already HUGE. Couple that with the fact that the item is, what, nearly 200% gold efficient without even counting its passive which is its main strength by far... and you've got a problem.\n\n\n**My suggestion?** REMOVE the on-hit doubling, EXCEPT on its own effect, so you'll still get an average 90 magic damage on-hit. And grant it another minor bonus on every second autoattack, such as +15% movespeed for 1 second for sticking power, and/or a small amount of true damage (10% total AD?). I think this would keep the damage from going completely out of control with %health on-hits which is mostly what is abused right now majorly by Shyvana and consistently by anyone building BORK. Devourer should have its role clarified as a mixed damage powerhouse for champions that dive backlines, they definitely shouldn't be melting squishies INSTANTLY and tanks very quickly. I think Devourer's weakness should specifically be health stacking since it has incredible mixed damage, and that's why I suggest a SMALL amount of true damage, but also sticking power for champions that need it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dextix LT","date":"2015-08-11T18:26:22.935+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its too strrong once finished, it makes champions like kayle outright broken.

It seems like there are a lot of different approaches one could take toward scaling it back a notch. If we were to do so, we'd want to make sure we did the right one.\n\n- In my opinion it is not too easy to finish.  If you manage to get off a couple successful early ganks, it's very easy to finish.  But then, so are most jungle items.  The issue comes in with snowballing.  Devourer kind of directly counters cinderhulk, and to an extent even Warrior, because Sated snowballs so much harder than the other two, while being just as easy to complete as those two.  The balance here is that the common champions that build it (like Nocturne, Yi, Shyvana) usually have awful ganks early.  So if you manage to pull off a gank early, when you're weak at doing so, you then get to snowball and skip right past your weaknesses.\n\n\n- Sated isn't really all that good before it's finished.  It's about even with the others, it's just that champs like Shyv and Yi synergize really well with attack speed.  But until it's sated, they can't really do much until they get another item, usually a BotRK, or just work to get it sated.\n\n\n- I think it is a few specific junglers that really can use Devourer at all and be good with it.  I've seen it on all kinds of junglers, but most builds fall flat on those champions, outside of maybe four or five.  While things like Devourer Kayle are good if you leave them alone, literally anything is good if you leave it alone.  I played in a game where a Devourer Taric jungle got to the point where he could solo baron.  And did solo baron.  In my opinion, that doesn't mean Devourer is too strong of an item, it's that you somehow lost the game so hard that the Devourer Taric jungle got to build 5 items.  That's a case by case basis on how hard you lose a game, not how good the item is.\n\n\n- My feel is that the item is a bit too strong once it's finished.  As in, fully sated.  Because with that last stack, you go from having a decent amount of power, to being super incredibly powerful.  It's an instant spike of power which can't be matched by any other item in the game, really, at least in terms of the types of champions that use it.  Personally I would like to see it if the item scaled a bit better to its final strength as you stacked it, then it wouldn't be such a shock to see the enemy Yi, who up until now didn't do much damage last time you saw him, but now he is three-shotting you because of his passive and the double hits on Sated.\n\nSated Devourer falls into the same Feast or Famine issue that was supposed to be combatted.  If you manage to buy it early, and you manage to stack it, that moment you complete it, you are usually the most powerful champion in the game and can duel anyone.  If you buy it late, and can't manage to get stacks due to your team being behind, it feels awful because the item itself only gives attack speed and that isn't very useful when you're trying to claim your own jungle back from the enemy.  It isn't even an issue of the stacks capping at 30.  \n\nIf you are behind the other devourer jungler and they hit 30 first, they will get their power spike first, and you are severely limited in your options of finishing your stacking.  And even if you do manage to finish your stacks?  It doesn't really matter, because you're going to be behind anyway due to how snowbally the item is, and the fact that the enemy should've taken advantage of the huge boost in power than getting that last stack gives them, so now they will have a gold/item/map advantage.\n\nAnd I think that's the main issue with the item, being snowbally and being completely feast or famine.  It's very rare that there is a devourer jungler in a game who is just kind of okay.  Usually they get super powerful and are a force to be reckoned with, or they can't finish stacks and are basically dead weight to the team.  Very little in-between.  I do not believe nerfing Devourer is the best option, but I think tweaks that make the power curve more of an actual curve rather than a sudden cliff at the 30th stack may help smooth out how feast or famine the item is.  Perhaps damage per auto attack until it transforms into the Sated phantom attacks, or something, I'm not entirely sure.\n\n\nEdit: Another note is that Devourer usually makes your jungler fall off really hard, as you're usually dedicated to going at least two on hit items (including Devourer) to actually get any real benefit from it.  So after a certain point in the game, where you can't instantly burst people down, you have the late-game assassin/late-game Yi effect, where as soon as you're caught by any CC, you get deleted.  That makes it so that Devourer junglers don't really 'turn on' until 18-22 minutes into the game, and then they 'turn off' around 35-40 minutes into the game.  They have that 20 minute window to win or else they end up feeling pretty lackluster, both before and after that window.  There are certain exceptions to this, just as with every other general rule.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagnificenTrynd","date":"2015-08-11T17:33:26.880+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":17,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RiotRepertoir,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=sKZ1BtYl,comment-id=0025,timestamp=2015-08-11T17:29:18.082+0000)\n>\n> I'm _not_ a jungle expert, so I'm asking this more to stay informed and in the loop than to offer a specific challenge/suggestion, but what is the nerf that it deserves?\n> \n> Is it too easy to finish?\n> Is it too good before finished?\n> Should we be looking at a few specific outlier junglers?\n> Is it just too strong once finished?\n> Is there something else?\n> \n> As you see it, what is the specific cost the game is paying on account of it being in its current state?

It doesn't need to scale into the late game by taking forever to stack, it scales into late by scaling with the other items you buy. Sated Devourer is a lot more powerful with 5 on-hit items than it is with 2, and it'll take you a lot of time to complete all those items.\n\nOf course this falls apart when Botrk is broken enough that you just need to get that and you're done, but in a perfect world Sated is an item that scales into the late.","replies":[{"poster":"Trash ADC Btw","date":"2015-08-10T19:46:49.578+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"The problem with that is simple.\n\n{{item:3153}} +{{item:3933}} = Melt any tank in 4 AAs at just about any stage of the game.\n\nI main {{champion:33}}.

Depending on your jungle, that's 2.2 to 2.75 seconds. With animation Resets in Vayne's Kit, even faster.\n\nNonetheless you are correct and I retract my statement about Kayle fourshotting Rammus from even, or even behind on farm.

Either their early game is so blah and weak that you're either power farming or getting farmed until the 20-30 minute mark, or something comes along and suddenly that near broken level of power you bring to bear late game hits early and you're wrecking house.\n\nSated Devourer is an attempt to make the on hit/melee carries viable and unlike Feral Flare is MUCH closer to accomplishing this.  Honestly some tweaking is all that's really necessary.  It doesn't have the on hit heal which is what made FF so dangerous and without the ability to abuse Challenging Smite we're closer than ever to seeing a decent item for on hit junglers and melee carries.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"MÃ¶ral Support","date":"2015-08-10T20:44:32.751+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Hagane No Arashi,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=sKZ1BtYl,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-08-10T19:23:13.035+0000)\n>\n> what needs the nerf isnt the sated devourer \n> but the devourer before getting sated \n> \n> the way it works now ... master yi buys devourer ... and he is as strong as he should be spending that gold elswehere \n> \n> so sated jungler can have realy good starts and even snowballl like mad \n> \n> the period of obtaining and stacking the devourer should be those guys weakness ... instead they seem to be getting the most of possible advantages and the least of the possible costs\n> \n> \n> \n> owerall sated devourer is quite well designed ... it just amplified certain kit's late game scaling \n> but payment for late game scaling is early game weakness ... this is where normal devourer fails\n\nDont say its healthy at all. {{champion:10}} {{champion:11}} {{champion:5}} get the item and can apply on hits TWICE.
