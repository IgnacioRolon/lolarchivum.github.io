You can set your team up for kills, or save them from deaths. While I do agree that there are plenty of support champions that have very passive play, I typically keep to the other ones that actually offer some excitement. My best support champ is Leona, and whether or not she has much damage doesn't matter. Her general tankiness keeps her alive through most of any fight, and her stuns are great for initiation, especially when one of the enemy champions is out of position. There's nothing more rewarding than landing an ult on the lone ADC who is away from his team, and securing the kill with roughly 4 seconds of stun time.\n\nI also play support because there's typically not as much for me to do at any point in time (not worrying about cs) so I can spend a lot of my effort being the shot caller. In many of the games I've won, my team has let me decide how team fights progress and which objectives to work towards. Since I'm not last hitting minions all the time I can focus on the board as a whole, and decide what to do in any given situation. You're support to your whole team, not just the ADC. You're basically always in team fights, so there's rarely a dull moment.\n\nIf the tank is the backbone and the ADC is the muscle, then support is the heart that's keeping it all working :)","replies":[{"poster":"AtaxiChaos","date":"2016-02-08T09:31:48.931+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":1,"body":"> If the tank is the backbone and the ADC is the muscle, then support is the heart that's keeping it all working :)\n\nBut the heart is the strongest muscle. {{champion:201}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Solidair3","date":"2016-02-08T17:13:20.457+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"*you* might not feel rewarded, but when I play Janna/Nami/Sona/Leona/Braum/Lulu I KNOW that it is my ult, my shield, my CC that won that major teamfight that got us all ahead.

I climbed back up to Gold playing Soraka, Leona, and Janna. I think the way a lot of people play support is what keeps them from picking up the role.\n\nThere's the player that thinks they're just a ward bot and thinks that standing behind their teammate and protecting them is always going to be enough. For sure, in some games you're going to do just fine, but in a lot of close games or ones where you're behind, you're going to lose easily. You need to carve out room in your lane and position yourself correctly every time. Always think about the next trade and how you can stay one step ahead of the enemy. Never let yourself get bullied because this season is really unkind to players who get bullied out of lane. You're already starved for XP and gold.\n\nThe next type of player is one who sees a lot of supports play like the one I've just mentioned, and they go the complete opposite route. They are way too aggressive and play like they're in a solo lane. They usually do this playing a mage, but not always. Sometimes they end up totally dominating their lane, but other times they contribute heavily to creating a snowball bot lane that consumes the entire enemy team. There is no stability. The matchup is more about if the enemy lane has an experienced support or not. \n\nPlaying support is all about knowing when to engage and when to play safely. If you've mastered that as a solo laner, then you're going to learn how to be a great support quickly. Another important aspect to enjoying support is figuring out who you like to play as, and where they excel at and what their weaknesses are. \n\nSome people say you should play all kinds of different supports so you can fill out what your team needs. I disagree with this for two reasons. The first is that support is never going to be enough to fill out what the team is missing. You're always behind the rest of the team in gold and XP. The second reason is you should always play what you're best at in a competitive mode. Support champions do take skill, and you want to give yourself every advantage.\n\nThe last tip to enjoying the support role is picking the champion you enjoy, **and it actually may not be an AP building support**. There's nothing wrong with playing a mage bot if you do it correctly, but give others a chance. You want to enjoy the champion you're playing more than anything else. \n\nI'm a Soraka main mostly, although I have been playing Lulu a bunch lately. I played a lot of healers in my MMORPG days, but I was pretty surprised I'd like playing one in a MOBA. A big reason I like her is that I get a lot of attention from the enemy team. I'm the number one target, and I can position myself and prepare better than my ADC can most of the time. I'm really good at baiting enemies as Soraka. I also am able to carve out room for my ADC in lane pretty easily as her now. So always remember you never know who you might enjoy playing.\n\nIn my opinion if you treat yourself with respect and realize you have the ability to contribute heavily towards a win, then you're going do great most of the time and most people will treat you with respect outside of Bronze and low Silver.\n\nAs for champion grades, wards are weighed heavily in support grading like any other role. That's both wards and control wards you place, and ones you destroy. Vision denial is very important. Oracle is pretty underrated as it is, but as a side note that trinket gives you so much added utility and you can do more with it than just deny vision. \n\nNot to mention there are just a lot of great ~~frustrating~~ Janna players out there that can stop any fight they want. Some champions are difficult to get an S+ on due to their popularity, just like any other role. Getting mastery 7 on Janna was a bit difficult for me too, but I was also learning her at the time.

Oracle is pretty underrated as it is, but as a side note that trinket gives you so much added utility and you can do more with it than just deny vision. \n> \n> Not to mention there are just a lot of great ~~frustrating~~ Janna players out there that can stop any fight they want. Some champions are difficult to get an S+ on due to their popularity, just like any other role. Getting mastery 7 on Janna was a bit difficult for me too, but I was also learning her at the time. So just be patient.\n\nI main Soraka too, but I have been having a rough time lately cause of how hard executioners first buy shuts down Soraka for the entire game. Riot needs to do something about it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ChaddyFantome","date":"2016-02-08T18:25:37.404+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its fun knowing your ADC (or the rest of your team for the matter) loves you when you make them an unkillable god blasting across the rift.\nIt's very easy to tell when the support player is good because playing support is more about macro than it is micro.\nKnowing that if it weren't for you, The tank wouldn't have done their job as well, the carry wouldn't be alive, you teammate wouldn't have caught the enemy out, etc. Its all just so satisfying.\n\nWe the support players understand just how truly powerful and important the support role is.

Whenever I have a good support that I work well with, I feel like I have a true partner bot lane, I don't call the shots, my support does, I don't set up kills, my support does, all I do is get the kills and some heavy poke off and ward a bush or two. People tell me I'm op (and I'll admit I play {{champion:104}}  whenever I'm not playing {{champion:202}} , but I do have other adcs as well) but I just say \"it's all the support\" I let them know how awesome they are, because your team always appreciates it. I had a Thresh once, I came into the game 2 minutes or so late, I come in NOT A SINGLE HIT WAS ON THAT TOWER!! He was tanking harass, harrasing back while waiting for me, he was amazing, landed every hook, knew when to throw every hook, made the best engages resulting in several early kills. I'm sure knowing what you did for your team is enough, but I honestly wanna thank every support main out there, it isn't easy all the time, gotta make sure your partner isn't a potato and make good calls of which I all appreciate.{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"Rhosta","date":"2016-02-09T09:48:23.456+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Stahp it.

Poking down and zoning out is fun too making the enemy laners scared of you. (I do this whenever i go mid as well) Especially when you can prove someone wrong when you master a support champ and play them successfully in another lane. (Before they made {{champion:267}} Q weaker and buffed assassins, I used to play her occasionally mid to spice up the game) //coughadthreshtopcough// Especially if the enemy laner thinks you're VERY vulnerable without your adc and tries to 2v1 you when they're at a critically low health but you kill and shut them down. (Who says supports aren't suppose to get kills when their teammate is dead?) This is just my opinion though X3 sorry if i was bad at explaining some stuff.
