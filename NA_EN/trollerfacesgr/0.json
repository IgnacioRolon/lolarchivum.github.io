I'm confused as to what you are asking for.\n\nHere is what I assume you are saying and I'm going to respond to it.\n\n\"The experience, mana and energy runes are currently almost never used due to them being pretty bad and thus should be granted a buff\"\n\nExperience runes I disagree with (same with energy for a similar reason).  The way experience works in league it is pretty easy to tell in the early levels how many minions you need to kill in order to get level 2 and then level 3 (it's 1 wave and 1 melee to level 2 and then the cannon waves 3 melee minions to get level 3).\n\nGiving people the ability to get those levels even one or 2 minions earlier due to experience runes could mean major advantages gained by simply taking those runes and thus those runes become mandatory, with the end result being everyone is forced to take them to stay competitive limiting rune options in general.\n\nThe same thing might happen to a lesser extent with energy runes.  All of the energy champs are balanced around how much energy they currently have.  Giving them all an extra 50-100 energy might wildly through off the combos for champs like zed, shen or kennen.\n\nMana does need a buff though.","replies":[]}]}
