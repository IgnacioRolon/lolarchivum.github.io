Especially since Asol has some pretty unique strengths to assassin gameplay patterns. If you get forced out of lane, you can can confidently leave because you just float back into it after level 3. You can still kill them easily in level 1 if they do not respect your level 1 cheese. You can out-roam them and only talon can really compete with your roam potential. You can win by playing the map where many assassin players will not be able to counter if you outplay them on this level.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SoryInAdvance","date":"2018-05-07T20:19:39.273+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can ban him for the time being ¯\\\\\\_(ツ)_/¯","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Dog of Pavlov","date":"2018-05-07T17:03:15.658+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":3,"body":"It's actually frustrating that Riot thinks Syndra's almost 48% win rate has the potential of being too OP (see Meddler's comments in response to my question about Syndra post Q revert) BUT having Zed over 50% win rate who is a much higher skill cap champion is somehow okay.
