I'm curious if you have any extensions running that could be blocking it.  Try disabling them to make sure.  It might also be necessary to reset your [cache and cookies](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752694-Clearing-Browser-History-and-Cookies) in case the page isn't able to support your language.  Trying on another browser altogether might help too.
