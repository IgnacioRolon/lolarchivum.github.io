I just want to have fun and an enjoyable-ish game. Every time I start a normal I get crap on because I&#039;m bad and I once went 0/23 with Ashe because I have no idea how to play ADC.\r\nSometimes I feed first blood and then one or two dudes on my team AFK or start flaming me and asking me to have a glass of bleach. Because of one death. That doesn&#039;t make me any better in any kind of way and I just keep on feeding, even though it&#039;s not &quot;inting&quot;. Believe it.\r\nSo I end up 0/6 with Garen because some genius thought &quot;I&#039;m gonna play ranged top&quot; and my team doesn&#039;t get that. They so start flaming me and blaming me for anything bad that happens to them. Should I stop playing like i was told to, but how to i learn if i&#039;m not allowed to play. Their answer was that i don&#039;t get to play this game. What should I do.

It's because in league people expect you to play well. Never before in cod have I gotten screamed at by a teammate for not doing well. People just don't care as much. In my experience at least.","replies":[{"poster":"MrHaZeYo","date":"2017-03-25T12:09:43.148+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was a semi pro CoD player during MW3 and Bo2 and I played CoD religiously from CoD4-Ghosts.\nI've played League for four years now.\n\nIn CoD I or my squad mates never flamed a random for being bad at CoD. We que up for \"normals\" in CoD and just assume we are better and will carry the randoms on our team. For the most part we always did. \n\nI think the differences in mentality from CoD to League is that in CoD you just assume everyone is bad, and when you do bad you put the blame more so on yourself for not doing more. In League you for the most part assume the people your playing with are at least as good as you so if your doing decent or great you automatically think they should be as well. Which is not the case. So you put the blame on your teammates. \n\n\nEDIT: If I had to pick though, which was more toxic? It was definitely CoD. Before the party system so CoD4-MW2 you would go in lobby and the shit talking would start before you even knew who was on your team. Made the game more fun for me tbh. I loved hearing my name mentioned so I could stomp the person/people in game and if they stayed I'd talk shit, if they left I'd send them a friendly message :). League is toxic but not really at the same level. You rarely got into games where people of all ages weren't shit talking. I always believe more speak with your gameplay and not your mouth cause when you talk shit and get hit then you're just a idiot.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-03-25T11:54:27.242+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Idk, i don't think i've ever been in a match where there wasn't some squeaky voiced kid yelling at someone for being bad, or destroying them. lmao","replies":[]},{"poster":"Warlord Scrap","date":"2017-03-25T11:26:52.801+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean i havent played cod in years i prefer destiny and battlefield but there alot of kids that trash talk for no reason if you have a cool groupt to play with its nice though.
