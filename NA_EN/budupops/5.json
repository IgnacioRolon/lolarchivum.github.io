These prices are garbage. Lets say you already have your standard ap and ad pages. that means:\r\nMy udyr rune page:\r\nRune page:6300\r\nMovement speed quints x3: 6150\r\nAttack speed mark x9: 3690\r\nArmour seals x9: 1845\r\nCDR Glyph x6: 4920\r\nScaling MR glyph x3:615\r\n\r\nTotal Cost: 23,520 IP\r\nThis is equivalent to almost 4 6300 tier champions, which take about a month to get each. So it takes 1/3 of a year to get a specific rune page.\r\n\r\nSolution: All runes in their specific section (glyph,mark,etc) costs the same.\r\nExample: Quint AD:1025  MS Quint: ~~2050~~ -> 1025","replies":[{"poster":"Ratbert","date":"2015-02-09T03:55:07.357+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Except most people have the ms quints, armor seals and scaling mr glyphs anyways. That halves the cost.\nJust wait a year for their rune page sales too.","replies":[{"poster":"Budupops","date":"2015-02-09T03:58:04.139+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"This is meant for new and casual players who aren't rich of ip","replies":[{"poster":"Ratbert","date":"2015-02-09T04:02:53.065+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Then work your way up like the rest of the people you're facing.\n\nYou said \"lets say you got your standard ap ad pages\" so you would have the runes i stated above, which means you only really need half that cost.

Maybe Critplank, but Critplank and Tryndafag usually end up with Crit damage rather than crit chance and Crit damage is pretty high up there in cost despite not being all tooooo good. Pretty funny to use on Tryndamere and Gangplank, but not really viable in most situations, sadly.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dark Topline","date":"2015-02-09T04:22:43.058+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It takes you a month to hit 6300 IP? I probably make around 1-2K IP daily, and I think that goes for most players.\n\nEither way, RIOT just had a Rune Page/Rune sale, how can you complain about this now?","replies":[]}]}
