At the time we were taking more of a wait and see stance when it came to reworks and new champions that went out extremely weak. We've since been looking at whether we're better off acting more quickly, and then following up as needed. That approach potentially gets a champion to the right spot quicker, though does come with some risk of overbuffing given we won't have a good handle on a champion's average learning curve or optimal playstyle yet. Hotfixes also have a risk associated with them (making changes in the game with less testing time, patching servers while games are being played on them), so even with changes we know we want to make it's often not appropriate to hotfix.","replies":[{"poster":"lB2kGRlc8y","date":"2015-08-22T06:40:46.900+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The truth about most of the Veigar threads is winrate isn't a good indicator of how his champion functions. His only facet of safety was removed and at the same time his W that relied completely on the stun portion landing has now become a non factor. Of course there will always that have snail-like reflexes for him to punish, but all Veigar does is punish misplays, there aren't any ways he can master the champion aside from learning how to avoid abuse in lane. I feel the rework was 30% complete and was pushed out the second bot lane Veigar became a thing, and that strikes me as a huge injustice considering his kit has ample counterplay and his statistics were average at best.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Budupops","date":"2015-08-18T12:27:53.731+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ty for clarity","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Shroom Junkie","date":"2015-08-17T15:21:49.235+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"People raged that they didn't know how to proc all ult vitals(but i can't kite around!11 daz pro stuph) and because so many people did and she always fed and got such a low win rate, they buffed her without waiting.\nOivey.","replies":[]}]}
