It is extremely strange that new model, new texture, new splash image, new animations, new visual effects, new sounds are all shared between 975 and 1350 skins. Simply put, there is no clear metric that actually dictates skin pricing and that Riot arbitrarily decides in which tier a skin will fit. \n\nSorry to say but the Guide to Skin Tiers needs to be reworked.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-10-13T01:21:43.434+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"They do share potential similarities, however, in the 975 RP tier, we're usually looking at new particles/sound effects where needed, and a recall animation. \n\nA good example of this would be with Arclight Vayne (975 RP) where only necessary particles/sounds were changed, as compared to Arcade Sona (1350 RP) where we changed all particles, and gave her all new sound effects. Some skins only need new particles, whereas others need sounds, too,  because we've completely changed the weapon. \n\nThe rules aren't hard and fast - we price each skin on a case by case basis - which is why there is the 'sometimes' category.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CosmicWaters","date":"2015-10-12T19:28:01.053+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot KateyKhaos,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=wO7AKvAh,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-10-12T19:09:12.525+0000)\n>\n> Hey Budupops, \n> \n> We don't have plans to stop creating 975 RP skins and move forward with only 1350 RP skins.\n> \n> You're correct that one of the most noticeable differences between the two tiers is the voice processing - as seen most recently on Demon Vi.
