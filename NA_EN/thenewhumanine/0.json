It would start and end with the E animation so I assume its just a minor visual bug. I tried on varying effect quality levels and it was not affected.\r\n\r\nREPRODUCTION\r\n1. Load into a custom game\r\n2. Pick Corki\r\n3. Get E\r\n4. Cast E and observe strange pink bubbles\r\n\r\nIt has occurred every time I played the champion.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-06-26T22:22:56.109+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey TheNewHumanine,\n\nThanks for the report! We'll look into it! {{champion:99}}\n\nEDIT: I was unable to repro what you're seeing. D: Is this happening in every game, or just one? If you're seeing this in every game, I may suggest repairing your client.
