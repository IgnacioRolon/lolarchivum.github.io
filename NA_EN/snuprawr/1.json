Its not just damage, or toxicity. Its like i can feel it, i can feel the unsatisfactory feeling after each game.\n\nIts like that horrible feeling where you have to win to not feel bad, but you don't feel any better when you do.\n\nAnd when you loose, its horrible not only because of people blaming you or others, but the fact that it might have been nearly impossible to make a comeback or the enemies rub victory in your face.\n\nNot to mention you wasted most of your 20 - 40 minutes trying to have fun only to be killed instantly and respawn in 30 seconds time after time after time again.\n\nThe only thing that keeps me here is my favorite mains, bot modes and skins.\n\nAnd the occasional awesome player i meet every once in a while.","replies":[]}
