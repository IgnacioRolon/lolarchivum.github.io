It seems like on these boards everybody just comes to circle-jerk why X,Y,Z champs are OP or UP or need to be changed, or shouldn't be changed like that, and just how overall Riot is screwing the game up.\n\nJust play the game and let Riot worry about \"screwing their game up.\" As it stands, they have the most popular free to play game in the world, so I think they're doing something right. If you don't like what they're doing, LEAVE. Why stick around and down everybody when you are openly admitting to disliking the course the company is taking with their product?\n\nYeah I know some people are only reacting to specific changes, but can we get some more love for changes we do like instead of all the things we hate?\n\nI personally agree with most of the changes Riot has made recently, especially in the JUNGLE (le gasp). It makes me sad when I see everybody talking about how the jungle is straight garbage now, and how its unfun, and only 3 champs are viable. None of that is true :( I can play more junglers this season than I can last season! Yeah its harder overall, but the potential for more champs to succeed is also higher as well :(.\n\nHere's to Riot, keep it up!","replies":[]},{"poster":"thatdude2090","date":"2015-02-03T22:42:01.080+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"You seem like a decent person.
