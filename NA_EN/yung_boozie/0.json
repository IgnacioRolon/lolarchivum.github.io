Start up league, play the game, then quit when I'm done playing.\r\nIf I want to then re-open the game again, the game never starts up. The icon appears in the bottom bar but nothing more happens.\r\nThis means I have to restart my computer. It seems I can only get the game to start up once per computer-session so to say.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-02T22:19:38.571+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Check to make sure that you don't have the option called \"close client during game\" turned on in the client options. That disables the client while in games so it might take awhile to reopen afterwards.","replies":[]}]}
