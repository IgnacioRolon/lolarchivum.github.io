It's also for the original GP.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"I Might Lose","date":"2017-12-13T19:42:39.234+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally i love the spooky gp splash art but that’s just me","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Eden Prøject","date":"2017-12-13T16:36:57.508+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly, I never use any of those skins.
