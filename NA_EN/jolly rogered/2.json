Gnar/Garen/Darius/Renekton/Fiora/Teemo/VLAD, all ranged magic dmg users. Tired of hearing this counter crap.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sire Hippington","date":"2015-01-20T02:14:43.295+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"funny, never had prolems vs shen or any melee befor that patch, but the noticible reduced furry+heal from minions makes lifes much harder vs ranged and in clashes. While you gain more helath and fury for more enemy champs, you rarly can hit many at once if they don't suck hard at positioning. Healing and mostly gaining furry from creeps befor fights is significantly worse than before + fury decays faster, so it actually was a nerf to renekton overall, atleast for gold+.","replies":[]},{"poster":"5thYL","date":"2015-01-20T00:50:28.327+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cause Shen ult's value is too great.","replies":[]}]}
