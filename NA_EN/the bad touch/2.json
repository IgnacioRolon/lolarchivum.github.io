This is a screen cap from 15 minutes into a championship match in season 1. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/B6UsGUcJVQQ?t=1132\n\nNotice that not a single person has a completed item. These days at 15 minutes people are sitting on 1.5 completed items. Notice that support builds? Supported used to function on around 30-40% of the gold income of a laner. Now they run at about 80%. That's why you see stuff like support brand being able to 1v1 an ADC and generally win. Season 1 support couldn't 1v1 an afk guy. They were SUPPORTS. They SUPPORTED their team.\n\nTHIS is what we miss Riot. THIS was your game.\n\nLet's compare that to 15 minutes into a season 8 game.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/q84aaUJ\n\nNotice the item bloat?\n\nhttps://youtu.be/IWz5aA7DaiM?t=1241\n\nIt only gets worse when you take in the new tower plating. 15 minutes in I've seen 2/1/0 ADC's sitting on 2 completed items.\n\nLet's not forget that 3 items on a champ is when they go from mid game to late game. Mid game now lasts 4-6 minutes total.\n\nI mean all of this is ignoring the gutting of level 1-13 defensive stats, the adding of high damage keystones which didn't use to exist, and the inclusion of 10 different forms of armor pen that didn't exist before... ect.\n\nAll of this leads up to why we get these boring triple tank into triple tank pro games these days. No single tank is ever going to hold up to 4 2-3 item champs for more than a couple seconds. So to play safely they run a crap ton of front line. Ironically damage being out of hand is WHY we see tank meta pro games.\n\nAlso note that your typical ranged pokey type mages don't really see play anymore. Why? Because they are mid game monsters. There is no mid game.","replies":[{"poster":"VG Crows","date":"2018-12-28T22:42:12.378+0000","up_votes":45,"down_votes":1,"body":"Been saying it forever: more damage in the game causes pro players to NOT fight even MORE than before.

Is season 1 and 2 is was extremely rare to see a full build champion unless the game was pushing an hour or more. Some games did that, I remember having a game go almost an hour and a half.\n\nBecause mid game is so blasted short now you have this weird  bipolar meta where it's either 1-2 high dps (high to the point where it's basically burst as well) champs with 3-4 tanky front liners. Or you have 2-3 assassins/divers + some sort of drain tanking anti tank or a Varus/Vayne/Kaisa to finish up the tanks.\n\nSo you basically only have 3 matchups.  Divers vs DIvers. Tanks vs Tanks. Or Tanks vs divers. It's a pretty boring meta that doesn't seem to include traditional supports, poke mages, or Brusiers/Juggernauts.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HadesBlades","date":"2018-12-28T21:44:59.600+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":15,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SnackerMore,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=OaNAYNAo,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-12-28T21:15:13.904+0000)\n>\n> you actually make a good point, but it doesn&#x27;t explain damage late game though, when everyone DOES get their items.\n\n\"Late Game\" inherently explains itself. When that period of the game is reached most champions/players have reached their power limit and plateau. Now that varies depending on gold from CS/Kills/Assist etc but even in late game if you're playing Jax/Vayne, for example, you can smash because the game is more skill dependent rather than item dependent like in the early game. If a Sion gets ahead early good luck trying to get a kill, he'll have corrupting pot, armor/health to block your damage and return it. Say if Vayne gets to 5 items though or even 4 items then that Sion is toast because she has the ability to kite and deal true damage, that is, if she knows how to play vayne. \n\nIt's not that damage which is too high it is the overall skill of players which has gotten better along with early items. Players over the years have gotten far better. Look at season 1 CS vs season 8 CS. What Riot needs to implement is more diverse item options, not cut damage across the board. Riot has always been cautious of adding too many items because of confusing build paths and it can overwhelm the player. I personally think that's a poor excuse. Items are largely stagnant and Riot tunneling build paths so you only need to buy 1-2 pieces of an item is what allows champions to be so strong.\n\nRunes and Keystones have always been hard to balance and this new system which was just updated makes it much worse. Tank/Bruisers become too strong as we see with Sion/Maokai/Darius when defensive items/runes are buffed(Not Maokai now but you should have seen him pre-update) or we see the burst from LB/Syndra/Caitlyn/Lucian when they are weak.","replies":[{"poster":"The Bad Touch","date":"2018-12-28T21:54:40.061+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=HadesBlades,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=OaNAYNAo,comment-id=00000001,timestamp=2018-12-28T21:44:59.600+0000)\n>\n> &quot;Late Game&quot; inherently explains itself.

Last hit insurance... less Lag from better PC's. Minions that follow set patterns much better. Better/faster auto attack animations. Easier to target hitboxes for auto attacks. Also more gold early = more ad/ap = easier cs'ing... which means more gold...\n\nIf you actually look at it also there is only about a 25 cs difference at 15 minutes. THat what 500-600g? A full item up that does not make.\n\nAgain is still just gold bloat. Take the same game we have now. Reduce all sources of gold income by 30-40%. And you have a better/more strategic game with many more viable champions.\n\nLet's not forget one very important fact. DPS champions get damage items faster than they get base defensive stats from levels. Thus squishies pop squishies much faster. \n\nLevel 9 Squishy with pickaxe+boots+doran's blade vs Level 9 squishy with Sheen + boots is a MUCH slower fight than 2 level 9's with Stormrazor + zeal and Manamune + sheen.\n\nDuskblade for example wouldn't be such an issue if bot lane was level 9 or 10 by the time mid could afford to buy it. Having some Zed roam down before you even hit 6 with a duskblade is the issue.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Napoleon3","date":"2018-12-28T21:32:04.034+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":2,"body":"i miss season 4 and season 5 bro things where balanced those days.im still waiting riot to bring back season 5 this is the only reason i am still playing this game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MorgManBasher","date":"2018-12-29T03:12:44.515+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":12,"body":"Yes, bring back the days when supports were walking around as a walking ward so the player base doesn't want to play it again and literally say mid or feed when they get the role.\n\nStop suggesting lowering support income, you are literally saying one person on each team is the team's bitch.

It was a ton of fun trying to accomplish as much as you could with the limited funds you had. Also your vision game was MASSIVELY stronger.\n\nAt least in solo queue 90% of supports are just mid mage mains on their off role working with 70-80% of the income they'd have in a solo lane. They don't even feel like supports.\n\nI'm also not saying all changes have been bad. I'm fine with spreading the gold around more than in season 1 and 2. What I'm utterly against is how fast carry vs carry fights resolve. This in entirely due to items being handed out before base stats are there to prevent the \"one shot.\" Take the game we have now... globally lower all forms of income by around 30% and you have a much more strategic game. At it stands league plays more like a bullet hell than a MOBA. The first non tank to not dodge a CC dies instantly. Again this is due to carries getting items sooo much faster than they used to. \n\nEven if you just look at gold totals there is 5-6k gap on gold earned. If you do want to use the \"people CS better\" argument (which at best accounts for around 2k) then here is an idea. Because people CS better.... how about we lower the gold income from minions to compensate. IE raise the bar.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Śhunpo","date":"2018-12-29T10:10:20.459+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"SUPPORT, you're not supposed to be a damage dealer lmao.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SpiritOfOdysseus","date":"2018-12-29T01:25:46.705+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"I've had ludens, oblivion orb, and sorc boots at 8 mins pretty consistently (in aram).

Why the hell does Irelia have 2 Null-Mantles and a Chalice and a Phage? Why does Corki have three Doran's Blades? Because they aren't as good at the game in that time to know that they just gold sink'd themselves for no reason when they should be working on completing items. No one would do something so asinine in today's League because everyone knows that it's almost always better to complete items than it is to buy the parts.\n\nThis thread is heavily misleading.","replies":[{"poster":"ExpStealer","date":"2018-12-29T20:40:50.906+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It isn't, because *now* I have the experience.

It's super easy to jump on a new scene and flex like you're good when no one knows what they're doing. The general skill level of the *entire community* has increased greatly since back then. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSHvzZy1YZA\n\nPerfect example\n\nAphromoo's talking about how easy supporting is. Meanwhile, his opposing Corki's walking into melee range of a Leona and he's Flash auto'ing a minion. The enemy plays the whole thing from start to finish like a bunch of bronzies...but this is **Aphromoo** we're talking about. There's no way he's in a bronze game, but his enemy plays like some bronze/iron elo shit.\n\nLeague is a decade old. The skill floor is higher than Season 1. It's the same for any older competitive scene. Longer it lasts, harder it is.","replies":[{"poster":"saltran","date":"2018-12-29T22:28:48.129+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That clip is legendary, but I think he was high there.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
