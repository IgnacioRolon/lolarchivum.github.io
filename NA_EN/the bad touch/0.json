I'm just going to cover the basic points and leave this open to discussion and add more as I see fit. No it's not a low effort post Riot, it's the start of a conversation with a clearly stated topic._\n\n**Some of the key points of URF are increased attack speed, increased CDR, increased map mobility (cannons), no resource costs, more powerful map objectives, reduction in healing, and of course highly increase gold availability.**\n\nSo I ask what champions are highly played/banned. Fee free to ass your own but from my personal experience of maybe 40 games this URF event I'm mainly seen the following Picked/Banned.\n{{champion:84}} {{champion:53}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:31}} {{champion:245}} {{champion:81}} {{champion:9}} {{champion:114}}{{champion:105}} {{champion:120}} {{champion:24}} {{champion:126}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:222}} {{champion:145}} {{champion:55}} {{champion:121}} {{champion:64}} {{champion:89}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:54}} {{champion:11}} {{champion:25}} {{champion:555}} {{champion:246}} {{champion:133}} {{champion:107}} {{champion:35}} {{champion:15}} {{champion:517}} {{champion:134}} {{champion:412}} {{champion:23}} {{champion:350}} {{champion:238}}  \n\nSo we \"mainly\" end up with a list of champions that fits into one or more of the following categories.  High Burst/Mobile, Long Range Poke, Lots of CC with decent damage.\nWhat we don't see much of is DPS based ADC's, Tanks with bad damage scalings, Juggernauts, immobile shorter range mages, ect. Even less so than we do on normal summoner's rift these days.\n\nMy thought process on this is simply that the shorter CD's are, the more mobility is available, the more gold there is available, ect ect... the short the window there is for the \"less flashy\" champions to actually shine. There is a large difference in a mobile champ with 10% CDR, and a mobile champ with 40% CDR for example. \n\nThe more you speed up the pace of the game... the less viable defensive/farming/peeling/macro style gameplay become... and more more the game turns into 3 second long damage wars where he who bursts first bursts last.\n\nThoughts?","replies":[]}
