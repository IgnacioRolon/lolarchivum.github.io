Jinx and Garen.\n\nNow why is that you think? Used to love Ryze, Galio, Akali, Fiora, Soraka, Jax, Kayle,Nida, Maokai, Mord, you name it.

How many of you can honestly say you wouldn't prefer a previous Season? Pick a season 1 through 5. League just no longer plays like league. \n\nThese days all fight resolve in under 3 seconds, at any given time maybe 30 champs are even played and each of those champs has at MOST 2 viable builds. If I had to pick when things really went south, I'd say between the addition of devourer and the tank ekko nerfs. Everything after that has been crap.\n\nTHe only \"good\" rework was the WW one, and even it has issues. The main issue being it's pretty much limited to playing it tanky/bruiser jungle.\n\nI feel like the whole game has been balanced around a \"pro scene\" that I don't even watch.

But then I am very conservative in my playstyle, and generally not a fan of big changes. \n\nBut a few specific examples: Fiora and Irelia. These 2 in particular are champions I used to enjoy. But with their rework, I find I don't really understand them anymore. Also, with them having both turned so mechanical, I find myself not having low enough ping to play them properly anymore. \nNot using that as an excuse to want them reverted, but I don't find them fun to play anymore, because I feel hardware limited on them. Less fun for me is the keyword.\n\nWhile I can \"play\" probably half of the champions, there is only a handful I have \"fun\" with. Big difference.\n\nMajor changes: The \"new\" Summoner's Rift. I liked the graphics style of the old map - or should I say \"old game\", old client included - much better. It's what drew me to this in the first place, coming from DoTA. The original art style was just spot-on for a game such as this.\n\nBut the new art style turned so cartoonish, I didn't like it anymore. And so I turned to ARAM instead, only leaving the Howling Abyss to do the barest minimum of ranked games to get the free skin every season.\n\nSame with the game client itself - yes, it may have been flawed and its coding being a hopeless mess and whatever, but it had _character_. Something the new client is utterly lacking - its coding is apparently still a mess, and it managed to lose all its charm in the process.\n\nRunes and masteries: RIP old system. The old system offered variety to a much, much larger degree than the new one.

I actually would have considered myself a jungle main for a brief period time in season 5 and 6 until they literally reworked all of the junglers I used to play and enjoy. Sejuani, Warwick, Nunu, Maokai, and on a smaller scale, Rammus and Diana. I used to have a much larger roster of champions I enjoyed to play, mostly tank junglers, but now they've all changed and i haven't really got the time or energy to dedicate myself to learning them again. I work more than I did in season 5, I live on my own now and have my own shit to deal with. My pool of champions has literally just shrunk to ADCs because they all have similar playstyles. I just dont have time to relearn the champs I played for the jungle or really, relearn the jungle. It has changed so much and is constantly changing so it's hard for me to invest in it. With ADC, it's ateast a by in large stable role, except for the last half of last season(which was stressful and upsetting since if my class of champions had stayed like that, I dont think I would have continued playing and, with the amount of stuff I have invested into this game, that would have been total shit).\n\nI think that reworking champions is a good thing... but I admit there hasnt been a single champion to date they reworked that i look at and say I want to play. I'm still upset that they reworked and trashed Sejuani. I miss her old ult.
