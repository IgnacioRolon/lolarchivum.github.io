Is there something i have to do for it to not do this? I thought showing the f2p champs and the patch notes in the launch client very helpful.

It's been awhile since then so I'm not sure why you're still having that article shown on the launcher. It might just need a simple refresh by closing and opening it again. If that doesn't get it and you still want those articles to be refreshed, I'd go ahead and try doing a quick repair through the client options.","replies":[{"poster":"buttcrack licker","date":"2017-07-14T02:42:34.993+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"gave both a try and it didnt work, got any other ideas sir?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-14T02:54:19.170+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh, so you're actually getting that popup every time but you don't have to run through the actual update process? Weeeeiiiiiiiird.....\n\nLet's try grabbing our [**Hextech Repair Tool**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367-Automated-Troubleshooting-Hextech-Repair-Tool) and running it with the option **Force Repatch** turned on. That should make the client run through the latest patch again which will hopefully tell that client update that its job is done.","replies":[{"poster":"buttcrack licker","date":"2017-07-14T03:22:45.403+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately this didnt work either. feelsbadman","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-14T03:53:13.509+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well snap.
