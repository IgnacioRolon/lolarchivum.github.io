This was game one of my series to try and once again advance from Bronze 5. At roughly 10:00 a.m CST I started game one hoping to advance in a game I have played for several seasons now. Alas it seems that the reporting system once again fails to actually hinder the negative gameplay and behavior of the League community. I know that this post will not help remove this player or even help improve the system, but I feel that if more players become proactive in helping stop such behavior then maybe just maybe something will set off the alrms at Riot and the devs will find an effective method to help players who actually want to represent League in a positive manner.\r\n\r\nMy hats off to Riot for the game itself, sadly the community makes this one of the worst games to try to stay involved in. Long time players such as myself probably won&#039;t stop playing due to time and money already invested, but the influx of new players may dwinsle due to the harrassment and abuse from other players wether it be verbally in chat or by doing things like trolling a game to purposely ruin the game for the team they are on. Maybe we can as a community come up with some better type of system to help the Riot devs brainstorm a way to clean up the negativity that plagues such a wonderful game.","replies":[{"poster":"Valderis Vandala","date":"2015-09-02T17:12:14.842+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just because they say it doesn't mean its true, they could just be trolling you, the image says whatever you want it to say, it proves nothing.","replies":[{"poster":"JonTucker","date":"2017-10-18T11:59:34.445+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Valderis Vandala,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=FvEcRPEg,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-09-02T17:12:14.842+0000)\n>\n> Just because they say it doesn&#x27;t mean its true, they could just be trolling you, the image says whatever you want it to say, it proves nothing.\n\nI agree it may not be true but my point is it does happen I'm 37 yrs. old i don't have the spare time to play with some immature child who is mad cause mommy took his iphone. I come to compete with serious competitors. If i make mistakes i am the first to admit it. But to have someone intentionally sabatoging games is just infuriating. But I suppose I am a glutton for Punishment or a hopeful gamer. cause i will continue playing and hoping it gets better.","replies":[{"poster":"ChiTenshi","date":"2017-10-18T12:04:54.344+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why was this bumped?!?!\n\nLet it die.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Valderis Vandala","date":"2017-11-10T04:36:40.219+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Daaaaaaamn, dude this was like 2 years ago. XD\n\nAnd by the looks of it you are still at the bottom 0.15% of ranked play (thats bottom 1% of bronze 5). Wow, that is actually impressively bad. Also at the bottom 4% or aram.\n\nI guess it just doesn't get better for you eh? XD Which is to be expected, if you only play ranked and aram and never any normals how do you expect to learn anything? If you want to learn LoL stick to normals on summoners rift first, play like a 1000 games there, then try to go back to ranked.\n\nI'm sorry if I touched a nerve with this post, I don't mean to. I just had to look up your stats after that 2 year post, either you never play or you are just really bad at this game. Perhaps you should just give on ranked. I'm 30 something myself, I know how toxic this community can be, personally I stay away from summoner's rift, I don't even touch normal games, I just stick with vs.ai + aram + any special gamemode that looks like fun (like that stargardian stuff, that was fun.) that way you meet a lot less assholes.\n\nI hope you have more fun in the future, good luck.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Indominus Blade","date":"2015-09-02T16:03:08.194+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"I am Diamond 4 and I have a bronze account where I play for fun (a.k.a extremely bad) and laugh at people like you.
