I had all 6 nobles and for some reason I kept the noble buff in the next round, where Kayle's spot was filled with the next character on my bench.  I didn't get her ult or attacks though, and I proceeded to lose.  Hopefully this can be fixed soon!","replies":[{"poster":"lazy potato","date":"2019-07-11T07:13:24.758+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"this just happened to me too, also with a kayle. she was keeping me alive in the game with my 3hp but she disappeared so i lost.","replies":[]},{"poster":"semisnorlax","date":"2019-07-11T05:15:17.647+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same thing happened to me.
