The evidence was very clear by chat, his KDA, his build, and everything.  I know for a FACT that all 4 of my team members reported him, and possibly a few of the enemy team members too.  After the game, I was sure I would get the instant feedback message, but to my surprise I didn&#039;t.\r\n\r\nSo my question is how exactly are these punishments calculated?  Does that guy get a free pass for trolling because he had enough games played where he didn&#039;t troll?  It seems to me that for a serious offense it should be a one and done ban.","replies":[{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2018-07-30T04:24:22.007+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"The IFS is tuned very weak towards trolling.

Yeah it seems terrible but Riot tries hard to make sure that it's system doesn't unjustly ban a player that is just bad at the game. It's why Trolls immediately just up to the 14 day ban when punished, they get little to no remorse when caught and hav a minuscule report threshold for being caught again.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Aneirin","date":"2018-07-30T04:34:16.724+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The feedback notification isn't guaranteed unfortunately - just because you didn't get one doesn't mean there wasn't a punishment.\n\nFor future reference: only 1 report is needed to trigger the system; doesn't matter how many people on your team or the other team report.","replies":[]},{"poster":"franticFurball","date":"2018-07-30T13:08:00.752+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">After the game, I was sure I would get the instant feedback message, but to my surprise I didn't.\n\nAfter I sent my Photo to Scarlett Johanson, I was sure I would get a Date with her, but to my surprise, I didn't.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fireman Teemo","date":"2018-07-30T05:09:20.781+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The system does punish spam pings and flamers as the same thing :p, just I think people don't report pingers more than flamers","replies":[]}]}
