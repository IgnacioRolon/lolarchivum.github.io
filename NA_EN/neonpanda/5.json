Sure there have been champions that I thought were OP, but never so much so that I was unable to play the game anymore.\r\n\r\nThe TFT meta is actually awful.  Over half the comps are unplayable because they just can't match up against the good comps.  I personally don't really want to play TFT anymore because I don't really enjoy being forced to play the same 2-3 comps every match.","replies":[{"poster":"DamSonWhUFndThis","date":"2019-09-02T18:17:01.725+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or the RNG sometimes?
