Really?","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So I decided to test my luck and play a provisional solo-queue rank game and just as I leave Champion Select for the game to start I'm hit with a disconnection alert (mind you my connection is fine) and when I tried relaunching the client considering the Retry option wasn't working  I ended up being hit with the fact that I had to patch my client again which took about 10 minutes. Now I'm sitting here with a lost rank game and a low priority queue timer of 20 mins for 5 games and I'm asking myself \"What did I do to deserve this bullshit?\n\" Talk about bad luck right .. And whats more mind boggling about it is the fact that I prob won't get my low priority queue removed and I'm SURE as HELL not going to get that   lost revoked. This is possibly my 4th low priority queue for the month and on top of that I've essentially lost three provisional games as a result of this issue and its saddening because I'm about to get a low rank position not because I fed or lost games, but because I could not play to begin with. :/","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-14T21:57:45.940+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"An escalated lower priority queue timer like this suggests a history of leaving games, because the timer will escalate the more games that are left.
