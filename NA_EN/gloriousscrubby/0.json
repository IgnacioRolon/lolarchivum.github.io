I&#039;ll try to include all details instead as it may be an ASol bug.\r\n\r\nBasically throughout the match, ASol was disconnecting alot. When someone dies, they sometimes would get stuck right in the very back, it looked like it was near the edge of ASols stars. I played LB so i could just W out, however Malz and Yorick had to flash out. I asked the enemy team afte rthe game but they didnt say anything. \r\n\r\nNow I don&#039;t remember it happeneing the first time i died but the 2nd and 3rd times so if I need to try take some clips from my match history (downloaded the game) to upload i can.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Stephiroth","date":"2018-11-21T19:15:55.533+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We deployed a fix for this last night around 7PM PST!\n\nPlease let me know if you're still experiencing this.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Enigmaticly","date":"2018-11-21T15:16:18.410+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This happened to my team as well in one of my ARAM matches yesterday.

Happened to me twice and our ashe once, luckily we had a ryze who was able to ult us out the first time, however we lost because of this as the 2nd time I got stuck I was the only one alive and defending against minions. \n\nThe first time it happened to both of us it was on spawn, the 2nd time it happened to me I just walked to the back of the fountain to avoid being hit and wasn't able to move out again.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ChristopherTurbo","date":"2018-11-20T20:35:37.630+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My team encountered this bug also.
