I Updated to New Client (new Patch) (with all the Training Tools and Stuffs.) and i was Put into 20mins. Leaverbuster which is i don't know how it Happens, So the main Problem is when i Queued up for a New Game it starts the 20 mins. Countdown, and when the the Time is Finished, it never Found me a Game.... no errors, no disconnection Errors, no Anything. not even a single sign, and everything just Came Back to the start... i clicked it 3 times now, and That's worth 3 games. but i never found a Match.. So Can Someone in the Makers of this Game Fix it? or Maybe Someone Can Teach me to Rollback My Update? -_- I'm Quite Disappointed.**\r\n****\r\n_p.s Sorry for my Bad English, I'm not a Native English speaker_. ****","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-28T03:57:08.777+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is this happening in both the Legacy Client **and** the Beta Client?
