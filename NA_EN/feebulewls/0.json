Perfect! You did a really nice job on this skin, Riot!\r\nBut, I still not satisfied with the sound quality of DJ Sona. It's too soft, I must say. You have to either adjust the game sounds (announcer, gameplay sounds, background music, etc) or turn up your volume alot to be able to hear it. My teammates asked me \"Why can't i hear you music even though I presses the button next to your icon already?\"\r\nThe special of this skin is the music, but Riot made it too soft you can barely hear it. That's a bit irony.  \r\nI'd love if Riot makes the music louder. Just my thought, Riot can make DJ Sona's music as the game background music, while teammates can choose either DJ Sona's music or the game default music with the toggle next to Sona's icon.\r\nThank you.\r\n{{item:3070}}  {{champion:37}}  {{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"Remlap1223","date":"2015-03-06T12:23:34.431+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah the music is hella quiet.

You don't need to talk to me like a child, I know what I'm  talking about.  The music literally needs to be 10 decibels louder because I have to turn the music to max on league, and and turn my volume up by 10 on my computer to reach the audio level the normal rift theme reaches.","replies":[{"poster":"CyberTootie","date":"2015-03-07T13:16:22.196+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The quieter that audio is, the more potential dynamic range it has. I say potential because it could be loudly-mastered sound (and thus have low dynamic range) with internal volume controls bringing it down, or the heavy use of dynamic range compression could be part of a relatively lower volume stream.\n\nYou know what you're talking about? Are you seriously identifying a notch on the volume control slider as a decibel? lol","replies":[{"poster":"Remlap1223","date":"2015-03-07T21:12:49.696+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You don't seem to listen do you?  You could make that argument of dynamic range only if there was bits in the song that got extremely loud while the rest stays quiet.  The volume stays constant throughout.  The dynamic range I wouldn't go far as to say it's \"low\" but it's really nothing special.  And no, I didn't identify a notch on the volume control slider as a decibel, I'm saying that it's so quiet it needs to be raised ten decibels in order for it to be on par with the other sounds in the game.  Are you illiterate or just cherry picking what you want to read to further your own argument?","replies":[{"poster":"CyberTootie","date":"2015-03-07T23:36:30.782+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be honest, I'm lost; I don't understand what the argument is about. My initial disgust was the thought that maybe Riot uncharacteristically put out music with dynamics (which they did, see below) and the general consensus is that \"it's too quiet, make it louder!\" which doing so would thus destroy the dynamics.\n\nI actually dove into this a little bit. This is obviously dynamically-generated content, meaning the game takes bits and pieces (what you might call \"stems\" in the music production world) and mixes them together. Granted, I have no first-hand experience of the intended results, but I took 5 elements that sounded well together, layed them out in a multitrack session, increased the master volume by 10db, and, while not as loud as I would have guessed, it is still ridiculously loud, and comes in at 1DR on the dynamic range meter. (I've never seen music have less than 3DR before)\n\nAt 0db, there's plenty of headroom for the mix; it only clipped once at that level. There *is* good dynamic range in the music with that headroom, coming in at DR10. And that's why I'm guessing Riot set the level where they did. So that there's room for the mix to breathe if you're playing at max volume. Which is a huge deviation from what they've historically done in the music volume department.\n\nAgain, I don't deal with in-game music, so I don't have a reference point of a \"standard\" music level. Might I suggest lowering non-music volume sliders to compensate.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"OJ191","date":"2015-03-07T02:15:13.317+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Remlap1223,realm=NA,application-id=aAJWt2b9,discussion-id=u0dA1Zat,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-03-06T12:23:34.431+0000)\n>\n> Yeah the music is hella quiet.
