It seems every other time i try to select a ping from the options my mouse becomes hyper sensitive and snaps to the edges of the screen. Doing it slowly does not help. The behavior of my mouse becomes extremely erratic only when i go to ping. \n\nMouse is a Razer Naga Hex V2\n\nEdit: The feature im talking about is Smart Ping, and i've already tried deleting game.cfg and persistedsettings.json\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-31T01:58:26.153+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That will usually happen when other programs are trying to grab the focus of your window, I know I've seen this issue when I was using Razer Synapse in the background. Be sure to disable anything like that including Discord Overlays and Curse Voice as well to make sure they aren't interfering with League.","replies":[]}]}
