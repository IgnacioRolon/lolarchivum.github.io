Please check your internet connection and try again.\" (see link). My internet was not the problem- I was able to load web pages (writing this as I try to reconnect), I was able to log out and back in to the client, but every time I hit \"Reconnect\", I got this message and could not connect.  Any clue what is happening? I was playing last night no problem, and I haven't patched since then.","replies":[{"poster":"Sir Critsalot","date":"2017-12-20T22:44:44.489+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did you ever find a fix for this?
