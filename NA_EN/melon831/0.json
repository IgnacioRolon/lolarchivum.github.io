That is the biggest decision. Everything else, as long as you keep 2GB ram or greater (go 4GB though) and a CPU that is within the past 8 years, you are fine. Same with the video card. Anything since 2008-2010 is fine. League requires almost nothing to run. If you want to run on super high settings and super high resolution with crazy high fps, that is a different story. But, run of the mill gaming just get entry level and you are more than fine. Anything entry level in 2016 is 5-10x more than needed :).","replies":[{"poster":"Melon831","date":"2016-12-02T04:55:36.379+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"EVGA GeForce 8400 GS 1024MB DDR3 PCI-E 2.0 Graphics Card DVI/HDMI/VGA 01G-P3-1302-LR \n\nIs this one good enough?(sorry first time building computer)","replies":[{"poster":"n64bomb","date":"2016-12-02T15:37:50.426+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"8400GS is pretty low quality. That is a 30$ video and will handle league (with some limitations on the settings), but isn't future proof at all and won't handle any serious games. Even if you aren't a serious gamer, I would go a little higher than that like 75-150$ minimum on a video card. What would I go with in your situation? I would go with the amd radeon rx 460. Best bang for the buck at around 100$. It is meant for esports. Are you building in a small case? This card would still work.\n\nhttp://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/best-gpus,4380.html","replies":[]}]}]}]}
