No, it isn't the same account as this one. My main account (locked?), for some odd reason, when logging on to the EUNE servers says im transferring, but in the NA servers says the password is incorrect. The ticket number is #30428358. I never logged on anywhere but the league of legends client with the account information. I've received a response from another player support, but I still haven't heard anything about what has happened.","replies":[{"poster":"weekdy","date":"2017-05-28T17:06:29.475+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"for the record* \nMy loggin username is different for that account on the NA servers than EUNE, and I don't think the NA loggin is synced with my email (?).
