At least not because he is hard to play.\n\n**Not all the champion in the game are supposed to be easy to play**\nAzir is an hard champion as well as {{champion:64}} {{champion:117}} {{champion:134}} and many others. He is supposed to be hard.\nWhy you have the need to lower his skillcap? Is that really needed? even if he need a rework he really need it first of {{champion:35}} {{champion:27}} {{champion:106}} {{champion:19}} {{champion:6}} {{champion:82}} {{champion:36}}{{champion:50}} {{champion:24}}  and all the other outdated champs?\n\nI spended an entire year playing Azir. I played him Top Lane, Jungle, Support, Adc even as a Tank ...and now I have to see him reworked just because he is too hard to play? {{champion:64}} players learned insec, ward hop and everything else. The same can happen with Azir.\nHard champions are needed into league. Even if Azir would not be available for those who didn&#039;t played him a lot is that a real problem?\nwith 130+ champions in the game not all of them must be accessible to inexperienced players.\n\n**If you need it nerf him** but pls don&#039;t go ahead with a rework. You already upset me with {{champion:69}} rework and {{champion:45}} rework (my 2 old mains). This would be the kill shot.\n\nhere there is what they said for those who don&#039;t know:\nSpeaking about Cassio:\n> How that work will be prioritized hasn&#039;t been determined yet.

Current intent is to look at ways to make him somewhat more accessible, with if needs be, some nerfs to his top end if those changes buff him there too.\n\n\nEdit: don't focus on who I wrote to be an hard champs I could have wrote other 20 champs instead of them. \nThe point is one: **He is being reworked because he is too hard to play.**","replies":[{"poster":"Erdamon","date":"2015-10-22T21:40:57.788+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":2,"body":"How is Lulu hard?","replies":[{"poster":"Axis the Dragon","date":"2015-10-23T00:14:42.815+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's not that she's particular hard to play, it's that her W and E have edge cases where you have to make decisions - and people not used to Lulu might not know which decision is best - whereas someone like, say, Ryze, where you can just pick him up and pretty much just mash buttons and come what may.","replies":[{"poster":"MealReadytoEat","date":"2015-10-23T07:35:02.821+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Ryze is extremely hard to play now, its the reason he has the lowest win rate in the game overall right now.
