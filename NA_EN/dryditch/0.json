If you want to know the important numbers, look up wards placed, towers destroyed, damage taken (if there's a tank), damage dealt to champions.\n\nKDA honestly means very little and only shows a pretty unreliable method of how a match goes. \n\nExample: ADC Jhin ends a game at 20/15/10, most kills on the team, but also the most deaths. You see that the Lulu support ends with 1/0/30. And a few others kills, deaths and assists are all over the team.\n\nGoing by pure KDA, it looks like the Jhin hard carried. But if you go into more detail, such as damage dealt to champions, you'll see that the ADC had the least damage dealt to champions on the whole team.\n\nYou'll also see that the tank (Mundo, Malphite, Maokai, etc) tanked more damage than the ADC dealt out and that every team member bought about 4-6 vision wards and everyone placed from 10 wards being the lowest, to 40 wards being the highest. ....then you see that the ADC bought 0 vision wards, placed maybe 4 wards all game and didn't even upgrade their trinket.\n\nThe end result? The Jhin was pretty much just last hitting the champions that everyone else softened up, ether by sniping them with his ultimate or his long ranged W.\n\nYou cannot judge how well someone is doing by their KDA alone. \n\nI don't care if the support is going 10/0 during the mid game, if they don't have a sightstone and aren't helping with vision.\n\nI don't care if the jungler is going 8/0 but hasn't been able to secure a single objective.\n\nKDA's are just there to boost your ego.
