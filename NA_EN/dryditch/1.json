He&#039;s a melee caster whose spells are closer to most ranged champions&#039; range. Galio has two abilities that function according to this melee playstyle--a W that reduces the free damage he takes while running towards enemies, and an ultimate that does a decent sized taunt. \r\n\r\nI DO NOT want to be read as meaning his ult or his W are necessarily &quot;bad&quot; abilities, but they&#039;re the ones that make sense for an AP melee champion.\r\n\r\nQ serves as a slow, if you can count the tiny slow on a champion it provides (in this age of mobility) as a valid CC tool to get in range. It mostly gets used as a damage nuke if he&#039;s building AP.\r\n\r\nE serves as a speedboost for the team, but it&#039;s miniscule in width, and only works in one direction. It&#039;s literally a champion ability version of Elixir of Iron&#039;s movespeed buff that does some decent damage. \r\n\r\nThematically and playstyle-wise, Galio&#039;s ranged poke feels at odds with his melee autos. Why not throw gusts of wind with his wings instead of just punching things?\r\n\r\nCould someone shed light on this idiosyncrasy?","replies":[{"poster":"Ravenous Howls","date":"2016-08-01T18:16:52.471+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally I would like to see him made as an AP Melee Battle Mage.

Emphasizes his strength vs mages as they will have a tougher time clearing waves to force him under tower or break early shoves.

It's similar to Fiddlesticks with his ultimate teleport, but Fiddlesticks still builds squishy. He can easily be neutralized upon arrival with good reaction before he can Zhonya's, or escaped from if outside of his Fear range. Galio does not build squishy. He could not be easily CC'd and focused or escaped from down before getting to activate his ultimate.\n\nDoes his W need to give him sustain? It's already rough to poke out a Galio as certain mages despite his being melee. It's like the opposite of Ahri's passive where she gains HP for clearing a wave, Galio gains HP for his opponent clearing a wave.\n\nSilences are not healthy mid lane. I know you're aiming for anti-mage, but on top of normal skill restrictions, Silences block Summoner Spells. In addition, it defeats the counter play of kiting out bruisers. They can't escape if you hit both Silences since you'll Q into them on top of the ranged poke which bruisers don't normally get. That gets worse if they're slows as it gives easy means to catch them should they be immobile or used their mobility.\n\nR changes to taunting Epic monsters and towers are pointless if you know how to juggle aggro with them. Closest target is hit by epic monsters, and towers attack the first champion targetted until it dies or leaves range.\n\nOverall, his Q and E are reminiscent of Aatrox, he doesn't fit the bruiser archetype because he has 0 sustained damage. His autos will be worthless since he won't be building AD or Nashor's, and once he's blown his load of E Q R W, he's worthless like any other burst mage. The only bruiser quality he has is the damage mitigation from his W which is in place on Live already.","replies":[{"poster":"TheSingularity","date":"2016-08-03T05:42:00.115+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Really good point on the q.

Not necessarily but I'm trying to avoid giving him a spell that's just an underwhelming bundle of stats.\nPerhaps making it a tower interaction? (perhaps he becomes one with the tower, extending his aa range a tad?)\n\nE: a new E was a real struggle to make fit thematically and lore wise. Legit took the longer than the rest of his kit combined.\nAnd again, didn't want to give him an aa enhancer that's just a bundle of stats.

It's about giving a ballsy galio the chance to rev up his dmg like crazy.\n\n\n\nIf he was a bruiser, what would you change his q to?\nWould it be melee? Ranged?

This allows Galio to get better mileage from E around corners and gives at least a chance of opposite-directional movement.\n2-- Wall-crossing.  Galio is a gargoyle, so he should be able to glide like one.  A Galio near a wall should be able to scale said wall and then glide a certain distance from that starting point (kinda like a mix of Aurelion Sol E functionality and Fizz E casting type with two parts)\n\n\nSo much fun to bounce ideas <3  Needs a Q.","replies":[{"poster":"TheSingularity","date":"2016-08-02T03:36:51.699+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Q replace slow with grounded at target location?
