An argument between two players can easily create a negative experience for the rest of the players in the game with you. Regardless of the other player’s actions, this does not justify your own behavior. You alone are responsible for your actions within the game.

I think there's a small minority that is injected into most games (Most being an operative word for the games being called into action in most of these conversations), and others just have off games and get flamed for it causing behaviors that accelerate out of control personally. Don't really understand why you're nitpicking, not EVERYONE who's banned posts on the forums, or even that gets punished, only the people that feel they were not rightfully so, there's no precedence for how many people actually do get punished or not and until I see such a number that proves your analysis of the situation correct we can only work off the information we have available. Which is that players DO get banned. How many people in total frequent the forums out of the hundreds of thousands of players of League? Do you feel like that is an accurate number of people in comparison to how many people actually play it? \n\nIf so then you can do the math from there and figure out how many it would equal out to based on both sample sizes. It doesn't take much, just time, and if you want to take that time go ahead.
