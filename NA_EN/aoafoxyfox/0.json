I'm already play 6 games in rank and I check op.gg to find out what rank tier I will probably get and I find out I got MMR 1267 and should be in s4, but when I finished my 5th game I checked my MMR and it said it should be place in s3. How does is work? I won, but my MMR decrease.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-18T23:25:05.685+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"MMR is hidden like Riveen said, and third-party websites don't reliably have a way of calculating this either so what you saw there is most likely incorrect. The placements look at your previous rank in the queue you were doing placements for, then watches your games to see how well you were doing. It's also good to remember that the ladder shifts *down* on new seasons too.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shadster","date":"2018-01-18T13:13:52.373+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The MMR it's showing isn't correct, it just shows an idea of how your MMR is looking. There is no site there can you show you your real MMR. It's hidden.","replies":[]}]}
