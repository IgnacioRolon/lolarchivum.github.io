Is there any way to make it so I don't have to do this everytime I want to  open the client? I've already redownloaded, it didn't do anything. Suggestions?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-09T18:50:53.058+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lockfile still existing might indicate that your update went awry.
