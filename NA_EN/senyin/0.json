His eye is on the wrong side.","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Miscellaneous","up_votes":3,"down_votes":5,"body":"Ok so this has been bothering me since Jhin was released, and I am just curious as if to anyone else has noticed this.\n\nIn game, Jhin has his left eye and left arm. Same side.\nHe is missing his right eye, and has a mechanical right arm.\n\nIn the splash art he has his right eye, and left arm.  Different sides.\nHe is looking into a mirror. So yes his -left- eye is there, but since is a mirror, its actually his right eye.\n\nIt is bothering the heck out of me, and I was wandering if anyone else has noticed this?\n\nI am hoping maybe in the future, Riot will fix it. Especially if more people point out the mistake.\nThey tend to do a lot of fixes on splash art (Like taking away poor Graves Cigar) and I am really hoping they fix this.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-02-22T21:43:05.283+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Hey Senyin -\n\nIt looks like this splash may have been flipped to fix better in the Champion Details Page. This isn't something we'd consider a bug, as it's common for us to flip the splash so it sits better on that page.","replies":[{"poster":"Senyin","date":"2016-02-22T22:18:08.045+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its not that its flipped.\n\nIn game he has his left eye, and left arm. Both on the same side.\n\nOn the art he has his right eye, and left arm. Two different sides.\n\nSo it isn't just a simple flip.
