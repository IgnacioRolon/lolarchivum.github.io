I'm pretty sure it used to be in the account section, but the only things I see are \"Purchase History\", \"Redeem Codes\", \"RP Purchase History\" and \"Gifting History\". If anyone knows where it is, please let me know.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading if you made it this far.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-14T05:50:36.007+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Transferring is not available in the Alpha/Beta client, but if you launch into the Legacy Client, you'll see the option there.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}
