We were all punished with the loss of LP as well as the ban timer. I rarely dodge, and so this is frustrating. Thank you for any response or indication as to why this might be occurring.\n\nEDIT: for clarification, the ban timer sat at 0 and wouldn't let us ban a champion before that","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-31T00:13:41.409+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've seen a couple different instances of this happening between today and yesterday, but it seems like this issue should have been fixed up by the devs already.

It's just that all 3 of us are in different states and so since they also couldn't ban, I'm assuming it isn't a networking issue. Glad you guys are aware of it tho!
