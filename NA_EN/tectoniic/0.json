So far only Vi has a functionality like that on her neon strike skin and Rengar has his hood in stalker skin. Small things like that do tend to make a huge difference IMO and isn't worth keeping as a novelty on only certain skins. It lets you interact with the character!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon Gerrard","date":"2014-11-21T02:06:56.197+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The legendary Red Comment!

As she is at the moment, to me her human form looks a lot more like a Lunar Revel skin than a blood moon.\n\nI really like the idea of working on her mask, maybe lowering the mask on her face (and giving her a more demonic look, despite the kimono/yukata), it probably would be enough to give the human for a much better look ^^","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ElegantCoon","date":"2015-07-11T04:35:20.855+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its such a disappointment I just bought this Elise Blood moon skin and its not blood moon its like pink and why are the legs on her back yellow?? I am so disappointed and sad, I wish i could refund this but no tokens!

I also feel that Elise's \"human\" form has always given off a seductress type feel as well as a royal one. I do agree that the mask movement would be a very interesting but I do not share the opinion that it would make her more menacing. On another note, the original pink color worked very nicely with the rest of the color pallet and particle effects, but I feel that the red color gives a much better contrast between her human-like skin and her wardrobe. If the Riot team were to revert back to a more pink hue, I believe that the new color should meet in the middle between the original and the new revised red. Unlike the beta Bloodmoon Thresh, I feel that Bloodmoon Elise has the perfect balance of red in the skin, and for the skin artists who worked on it, great job with the entire color scheme! I look forward to more beautiful skins such as this one.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HeresyUntoFedex","date":"2014-11-21T03:39:35.776+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, my opinion is that, while it's a nice looking skin, nothing screams Blood Moon to me. Sure, there is the Oni Mask, but for one, it's barely even noticable in her human form. \n\nThere's also that she just pulls a pre-color rework Battlecast {{champion:101}}  on the skin line. Every other Blood moon skin revolves around reds and whites(and grey I suppose, armor n all), and then {{champion:60}} 's skin comes marching in dunning colors more in line with Order of the Lotus. \n\nAnd also, I don't think it's fair to use the fact that {{champion:60}}  features red in her main skin as a reason not to give the skin appropriate colors, White on Red looks much different then Red on Black. And if that'ss till an issue, why'd she get the skin in the first place. Blood moon {{champion:222}}  coulda been cool, with a big ole' oni Fishbones. Just sayin.","replies":[]}]}
