I&#039;d remember sometimes I&#039;d just be sad because I couldn&#039;t live in some of the universes that I&#039;d immerse myself into. but they always did on thing for me: they made me happy.\n\nThen when I turned 9 I played the elder scrolls: morrowind and something clicked: Not only games made me happy, but they also intrigued me. Whereas before I could have some good laughs playing crash bash or tekken 2 with my brothers and sisters, this game made me realize that I coud immerse myself completely in a story without having to take my eyes away from the screen for hours at a time. I remember I used to have the map of Vvardenfell and I would plot out a course from balmora to Vivec. \n\nFinally about four years ago I played League of Legends and I discovered something else. I loved the challenge of getting better. I&#039;d stay awake at nights watching videos and streams to better myself as an adc. I&#039;d learn about orbwalking, what are the best masteries and runes for each matchup, how I should play out the laning phase, how to coordinate my abilities with my support etc. I loved losing, watching my replays and trying again as much as I loved winning and seeing the results of my efforts.\n\nUnfortunately. since mid season 5. League of legends is not a game anymore. It has lost the only thing the made every other &quot;thing&quot;  in the world a video game: Fun.\n\nLeague of Legends doesn&#039;t make me happy. Now why is that? just go on the forums and you&#039;ll have a multitude of reasons why; here are some that affect me the most:\n\n-You are never garanteed to win a game, no matter how well you personally play (lack of player agency)\n-The core elements of league of legends are being played with and changed as if they didn&#039;t matter (runes, balance, towers recently)\n-My main role has been gutted to the point where a top/mid laner plays MY lane better than I do.\n-I am forced to play an incresingly team focused game where the most ESSENTIAL tool for a teamgame (communication) is SEVERELY lackluster. We don&#039;t all have time to type in the middle of a fight nor can we read chat in the middle of a fight.\n-Riot games, in my eyes, is only interested in &quot;the next big thing&quot;.worlds orbs, halloween orbs, kd/a orbs, new skin lines and OBVIOUS balance changes that come with it to skew the $$$profits \n\nIn short, League of Legends is not a video game anymore in my eyes. it&#039;s just a time consuming, depressing, addicting activity that has brought nothing to my life but discovering the amazing content creators that make this game enjoyable to watch.","replies":[]}
