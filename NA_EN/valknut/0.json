You're in control of your behavior. The voicelines and emotes of the characters in the game fall in line with the personality that they have in the world of league of legends.\n\nYou're a human playing a video game with other people.

The champ select banning phase is meant to provide atmosphere, not to demean. the quotes from champs are meant to provide thematic atmosphere or amusement, not to demean.\n\nyour argument is so invalid that it makes me wonder what else you've used faulty comparisons to argue for or against.\n\nwhen you're typing (and especially when you're horrible at grammar or your wpm is awful) in the middle of a competitive game even if you were to \"jokingly\" call the opponent a troll because they're playing trundle you'd be more inclined to be accused of aggressively insulting your opponent because intent is hard to distinguish from written or typed communication. especially harder than verbalized banter. insulting someone you dont know is considered socially unacceptable practically universally. insulting a friend is considered socially unacceptable in public places pretty much universally as well. those that do are typically considered to be \"making a scene in public\". this is considered disruptive and offensive by many. when you're playing a normal/ranked match in league you're participating in a PUBLIC match. thereby exposing yourself to others and you've agreed to do so in a particular way as stated in the TOS/EULA of league of legends so as to not disturb others. What is included in that document is based on the server you play on as the rules are not universal for every nation and therefore not universal for every server.\n\nwhether you understand it or you dont is not my concern. if you want to keep from losing your account though you should at least make strides to differentiate between what is considered acceptable behavior and what isnt.","replies":[{"poster":"Valknut","date":"2018-12-29T10:28:54.623+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Uh huh right. tell me how you really feel.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"rujitra","date":"2018-12-29T06:26:59.888+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":6,"body":"Wow.
