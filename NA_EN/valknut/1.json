This game is at its turning point, its &quot; Cataclysm &quot; of the Moba world.

Back at league's height I saw videos all the time of just plain goofy, fun stuff.  Full AP Maokai.  The Dunk Squad... or dunkmaster Yi in general.  The full revive boogaloo.  Funny tribunal cases.  Xin Zhao being a man, and teams of 5 supports somehow winning the game.  I saw off-meta vids every day back then.  Now, not so much.\n\nBut things now are so stagnant.  You can't bring out fun, goofy or niche picks.  You can't make inane team comps and have a chance at winning.  Heck, you can't even usually get away with off-meta champs for the role you're in.  There are a handful of overloaded or overpowered champs that utterly DOMINATE the game.  There are a few items that you ALWAYS build.  The strategies and playstyles that win are pretty set in stone, and deviation is punished, both with an in-game loss and your teammates rage.  Rigidly enforcing the meta has made the game VERY predictable, since there can really only be a few champs who are \"best\" for the roles.  Enforcing certain playstyles does the same thing.  People have figured out the most powerful ways to play and that is how EVERY game is played.  It's... less fun.  The casual players trying to just play what they want and have fun are pretty harshly punished for it, by their allies raging at them and their enemies curb-stomping them for playing anything less than optimal.  In normals.  Even in ARAM, there are people who have rigged ARAM accounts to only unlock potent ARAM champs.  Not sure how common those are, but I wouldn't be shocked if you ran into one every other game or so.\n\nAnd even the die-hard ranked fiends aren't enjoying the game like they should either.  The people who WANT to play the best champs in the game and want to go super hard for wins are frustrated too.  Why?  Dynamic queue.  Solo players, even when playing the \"best\" champions and strategies just can't influence the game as much as the premade who are all in voice chat.  No, riot has narrowed the game's appeal down to only people playing entirely to win who have a premade of friends playing entirely to win as well.  Do you not have 2 or 3 friends who play when you do and want to roll ranked and tryhard?  The game isn't catering to you.  Oh, you can play it... but all the advantages in the game fall to those guys and their friends and if you run into them you're gonna have a bad time.  If they're on your team the game feels like it's in their hands with you a tag-along little brother watching them win or lose the game for you.  If they're your enemy you're unfairly facing a group MUCH more coordinated than you, while you struggle to get your team to even respond to pings.  Either way is frustrating and not fun at all, even for the diehard ranks grinder spamming the most OP meta champs he can.  Even HE isn't enjoying the game.\n\nRiot's choices lately have been pretty awful, and are pushing a lot of people away.  I'm one of them.  Sooner or later people will drop the game for something new... but right now it's a habit they have nothing to replace.  The next big thing to come along with any mass appeal is going to see a mass exodus of disillusioned league players breaking that habit for something new and fun.  It's only a matter of time.","replies":[{"poster":"Bobloser3555","date":"2016-05-02T18:35:46.641+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":3,"body":"well one of the reason why there isnt so much leeway in what to build or who to pick anymore is also cause people have become more knowledgable, people play more accurate, optimal strategies are widely known, it's a development towards relative perfection given the game parameters, the older a game gets the better the players become.

I'm seeing more \"learn league\" content (which is good), but hardly any FUN League content. Sure some of those people do stuff, but even those content creators aren't enjoying the game, so it's hard to even find the \"3rd party\" fun stuff. It's just a trickle down mess, and it doesn't help that even when you watch a streamer, even they are complaining about the state of the game in 5 different forms depending on the day.\n\n> But things now are so stagnant.\n\nI don't think stagnant is the problem. I think the game being far too in flux is the problem right now. Riot can't seem to let changes settle before they are throwing a whole ton of fuel on the dumpster fire. Preseason was one of the biggest groupings of changes at one time we've had, if not THE biggest at once (the closest I can think is the change to the current map). So many things piled on top that seemed to all be tested in a vacuum separate from one another, and things barely got to a balanced state (some still haven't) before we have the \"Mid Year Mage Update\" setting the place on fire all over again. It's been one long preseason of mess, and it is only going to get worse.\n\n\n> \n> Riot&#x27;s choices lately have been pretty awful\n\nSadly, I agree\n\n> but right now it&#x27;s a habit they have nothing to replace. \n\nSadly this is the only reason I'm still even coming onto the boards. I've been playing since 2010 and actively since 2011 (not always ranked but playing regardless). This is the least I've played this game since then, and not because I've gotten bored with LoL. I play because it feels like a habit to do so, not because I enjoy it anymore.","replies":[]},{"poster":"hopeful4","date":"2016-05-02T22:27:27.191+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":6,"body":"Wow, its been a while since i saw a doomtelling shitpost...\n\n Nah, i see it every day since season 2 in old GD and these forums actually","replies":[]},{"poster":"chipndip1","date":"2016-05-02T23:07:58.978+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Deitrix,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=8Unmenfr,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2016-05-02T17:23:45.610+0000)\n> A misguided romanticist's post\n\nSo we're blaming Riot for balancing their game as a meta develops in it? Do realize that although DotA was the original mod, LoL was the original GAME. The genre as a whole was growing with LoL as a game, and things back then, I imagine, weren't figured out. What works and what doesn't work, as well as why, was basically an empty sheet of paper's worth of information, so people could get away with whatever they wanted. Those days come with *any* game, but for this game it was more...\"pronounced\" (for lack of a better word) because, unlike other genres, there was very few examples to look at to base the structure and balancing of this game on.\n\nWe're now at a point where we know more about what goes where and why, and although it's still possible to come out with the double fighter kill-lane down bot, or top lane Shaco, or some other occasional hoodwink, dark horse picks and off-meta picks need to be made based on what's already expected and how you intend to get around using something else in its place. All competitive games grow, and developing a meta is a part of that. LoL didn't become a worse game because a meta developed, and one can't expect Riot to REALLY allow Xin Zhao to stay as broken as he was on release, or for a game to be won with a poorly designed team just for the sake of.","replies":[{"poster":"Tobias Brackner","date":"2016-05-03T01:54:14.506+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"The meta is also guided by the player base.\n\nEX:\n\nRumble is really fucking good.\nHe seems to fit perfecctly in the Tank/Assassin meta.\nNobody plays him for no fucking reason.","replies":[{"poster":"chipndip1","date":"2016-05-03T02:17:41.264+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Tobias Brackner,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=8Unmenfr,comment-id=000500060000,timestamp=2016-05-03T01:54:14.506+0000)\n>\n> The meta is also guided by the player base.\n> \n> EX:\n> \n> Rumble is really fucking good.\n> He seems to fit perfecctly in the Tank/Assassin meta.\n> Nobody plays him for no fucking reason.\n\nThe thing is that a meta is GOING to happen, but casual gamers and people that aren't too initiated with gaming in general don't realize that metas are important for competitive games.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"The Whamboozler","date":"2016-05-03T05:34:48.699+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"I said the game was growing stagnant because everything feels very set in stone and attempting to do anything outside of the most powerful and optimal picks/strats is VERY punishing.\n\nYou countered by claiming the game is well-known now with everyone understanding the proper way to do things, which champions to pick and in shutting down non-meta picks.\n\nThank you for putting up a big rant that basically says exactly what I said.

If a pro picks Kha'Zix mid or something and stomps that doesn't mean *I* will stomp.  \n\nThose picks have variety because pro players are both trying to gain an edge over each other AND trying to mix up their play so the enemy team can't predict their strategies and counter them.

When DQ first dropped, it was only an issue that affected higher ELOs, but as time passes, it is slowly trickling down the ladder because it is simply the best way to rank up.  Solo q players favor Solo q because it tests THEIR PERSONAL ABILITY, not their ability to listen to a friend that already has all of the answers.  I played 4 games in a row today (2 mid and 2 adc) As the mid I got camped by the jungler at lvl 2 and on.  As the ADC i got 4 man dove at lvl 5.  This his how I know that abusing DQ is trickling down, teams in this ELO are not that coordinated, they simply aren't.  How do I know?  Because in every high ELO game I watch, when a 4 man dive happens bot at lvl 5, the opposing team knows how to react, top lane TPs in, the jungler starts walking bot etc.  In low ELO, when you get 4 man dove, you and your sup are simply fucked because nobody on your team knows how to handle it.  At first, DQ was not very frustrating, but now that premades are more and more common, it makes me not want to touch ranked.  OP is on point with this one, as is everyone with an out spoken opinion against DQ.\n\nEdit: Also forgot to mention that in post game chat, the people I suspected that were a group admitted it when I asked them.","replies":[{"poster":"good4nothin","date":"2016-05-03T13:58:35.275+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Electric Buyers,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=8Unmenfr,comment-id=0028,timestamp=2016-05-03T10:43:09.854+0000)\n>\n>  Because in every high ELO game I watch, when a 4 man dive happens bot at lvl 5, the opposing team knows how to react, top lane TPs in, the jungler starts walking bot etc. In low ELO, when you get 4 man dove, you and your sup are simply fucked because nobody on your team knows how to handle it.\n\nThe low ELO experience in a nutshell.","replies":[{"poster":"Electric Buyers","date":"2016-05-03T20:45:18.014+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, which makes it less fun when one team has some kind of coordination, and the other team thinks the sky is falling 4 minutes in.
