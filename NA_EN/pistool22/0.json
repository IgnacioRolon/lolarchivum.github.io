It may be a good idea to hold back for now and test things out in custom games until you're sure things are going to be okay.

Getting the HRT was a good step, but I suggest going through every step of the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide too.
