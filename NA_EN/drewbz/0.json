At most it will spike to 40. Since the last live maintenance, I've had a floor of 42 with it going anywhere from there to 500 ping at any point and time. There's no steady rate. It's just a constant fluctuation of anywhere between 42-500 ping. I restarted my connection, computer, client, checked bandwidth usage, and tested my connections to other games' servers (all normal). This has prompted me to seek further help/answers. Anyone else dealing with this and/or does Riot know about this issue?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-08T17:57:18.814+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you're having network issues like packet loss, which could be happening for a variety of reasons.
