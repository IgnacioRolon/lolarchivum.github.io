It's why I hate it so much (that and how boring it is leading up to that point)  Also why this mode was so shit, it was on SR with all of that still in place.

Then when it comes to minions I'd have to say that I saw Ironbacks the most because a minion that doesn't die can push while I do the damage to push. Razorfins close behind those because carries will be squishy all game and these are the only minions that actually scratch anyone later on. The support one is nice but fails in comparison to the other two as far as satisfaction goes because they don't fulfill the normal role of a minion like the other two as far as pushing goes (and the utility won't mean much if you're far enough ahead or behind).

The former makes adcs so much harder to kill, and basically substitutes for bloodthirster while netherstride makes {{champion:69}} fly like an intercontinental missile. Other than that yeah doesn't change much. I guess melee carries can get flesh eater and have bs sustain in lane phase.\nMinions don't change much because a significant lead won't make your minions noticeably better. Dif minions are cool, but both teams get them so...","replies":[]},{"poster":"llamasx","date":"2015-08-01T18:44:30.527+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's definitely different.  Early game not so much, but late game a single baron steal can make for huge com backs.  I remember baron'd up razorbacks just chewed up the enemy vayne while she was kiting me and I couldn't do anything to her, but the razorbacks sure did.
