If anyone knows a solution to this, or know if anyone else is also getting this problem, it will help a lot if you told me because I submitted a ticket to Riot Support but they only say it's my hardware.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-11T20:34:46.689+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wonder if this might be happening due to all of the new Arcade assets on SR?

My problem was that the support team did not want to admit that this was causing the problem so they were looking away from it and telling me that it must have been smething else. Thaks anyways,","replies":[]}]}]}
