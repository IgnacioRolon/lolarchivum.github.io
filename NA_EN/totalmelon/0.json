Any hope for me?","subforum":"Player Behavior","up_votes":1,"down_votes":10,"body":"I was recently in a ranked match, playing as vel'koz. I was on a tilt streak and the kayn on our team was annoying me. I took out my anger on kayn and proceeded to flame the whole game, which we lost. Upon discovering I had been perma'd I sent a support ticket, pleaing for a permanent chat ban or some alternative punishment. I also asked for my skins etc. to be moved to another account. I've lost almost all hope in ever recovering my account, yet I will reform. I made a new account and I'll try and get in to honor level 5 and be an overall exemplary player. I had made many friends on that account and poured countless hours and money into it. I just feel it would be fair to migrate all the skins (i.e. money you spent on the account) to a new one. I'm in the process of reforming my play. I've seen riot unban a couple of perma'd players. I doubt it will happen but I'd like a system to prove your reform, or atleast move your assets. Please help because I don't want to see all I've worked for disappear like this.","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-03-10T01:41:15.047+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot doesn't lift bans that were correctly placed. After lots of badgering, they tried unbanning a few last year to see if those people would improve their behavior after such a lucky reprieve, but it didn't work out.\n\nTransferring a permabanned account's content to a new account would totally defeat the purpose of the ban. I don't know why you think it's a reasonable idea.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BLACK REALM GOD","date":"2019-03-10T01:11:21.359+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"title = no","replies":[]},{"poster":"General Esdeath ","date":"2019-03-10T04:40:08.004+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">I've seen riot unban a couple of perma'd players.\n\nSuch as...?","replies":[]},{"poster":"BoRnToKiLL666","date":"2019-03-11T21:51:42.200+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"nope\n\n{{sticker:sg-lulu}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"PH45","date":"2019-03-10T07:26:04.718+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First of all, the skins you had on that account, stay on that account.
