Its stayed on the regular clients page with one button that said (Reconnect to game). I tried that but all it does is just flash the screen a little bit and refuse to put me back into the game. I do not know why its doing this but i cannot rejoin the game and now i'm going to be put in the leaver buster system because of something that i have no control over. I have to wait in like a 30 min Queue for five game because you guys want to \"improve\" something that was already fine. PLEASE HELP, I DO NOT WANT TO BE PUNISHED FOR SOMETHING I DID NOT DO.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-11-25T21:12:29.256+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry for the issues you've been having here.  :(  This doesn't sound client related because you've already completed champion select and transitioning to the game itself.  The issue may be stemming form a network problem that's failing to reach the game server.  You'll want to stick to customs for now and run through the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to help fix that up.","replies":[]}]}
