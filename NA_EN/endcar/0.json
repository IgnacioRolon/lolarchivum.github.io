Originally, I thought of it as a regular stomachache, one that I'd get if there were bad gas or something I ate. As the hours passed, it never stopped and only grew worse.","url":"https://www.gofundme.com/jakes-appendicitis-emergency-fund","image":"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/21326536_1497969560.5198.jpg"},"up_votes":12,"down_votes":1,"body":"We are close to a financial implosion.\n\nOn the 18th of June early Sunday morning I began to have pain I thought could go away within a few hours. Already stayed up almost 24 hours working on a new art piece that I would add to my portfolio. This of course is in hopes that it would increase my chances for receiving interviews for a job in the gaming industry.\n\nIt had been several hours now and I dread every moment I looked at the phone. I am unemployed, can not afford health insurance, and if I have to go to the Emergency Room I knew that I would be financially crushed.\n\nThe pain in my stomach grew to an unprecedented level. Pain that I could easily relate to kidney stones. \n\nI did what I could to try and forget about it; watch youtube, talk to people on discord, message friends on Facebook, even call my girlfriend early in the morning as the sun rose. \n\nI&#039;m now on the floor curled into a ball and can sometimes hardly breath since most of it was exhaling to better relieve the pain clenching my fists as tightly as I could. My whole body shaking from how much of it I have to endure.\n\n8+ hours it took before help arrived. My girlfriend saw me on the floor and quickly I tried to respond to the situation asking her to get medication nearby. As she was gone my body no longer could hold on and began to work on recovery mode, throwing up a trail of vomit to the toilet. \n\nI could tell after that, not a single substance was left in my stomach and finally I felt relieved. However that was a false perception. \n\nPain shot back up like a lightning strike. My girlfriend now insisted we see a doctor. I still had hopes that I didn&#039;t have to be sent to the ER. Maybe just maybe clinical care could save the day and my wallet.\n\nAs we rushed to Walgreens I&#039;m screaming on each turn and bump. My sides and stomach feel like someone set a torch on my organs and continue to jab a knife into me.\n\nThe doctor comes out and see&#039;s me, my teeth clenched (trying not to grab attention or scare the kid next to me), and shaking uncontrollably. The doctor didn&#039;t even give it a second thought and immediately called 911.\n\nAt that point my heart dropped and I no longer could even try crying and instead started laughing at how unfortunate these circumstances were.\n\nNeedless to say we finally made it to the ER with the help of Paramedics. However this was the point where the pain has now reached its peak and clenching my teeth and fists were no longer a viable option. \n\nI&#039;m screaming and laughing for well over and hour in the room they set me up in. Even hearing one of these saying, &quot;could someone get him some medication please!&quot; That replaced some of the screams with some very loud laughs followed by more screaming. \n\nFinally the doctor came in and started shooting me up with several morphine shots for about another hour until the pain subsided enough to where I would occasionally start sleeping in and out. \n\nHad to take a couple tests where another few hours later the nurses and doctors came in to let me know that I had &quot;Appendicitis&quot;. They also informed me that they would need to operate on me right away due to the current situation thanks to the CAT scans provided. My appendix could rupture at and time.\n\nWell knowing the sevferity of the situation now I had no choice but, to agree to the procedure. 3 more hours later (racking up to 17 hours of pain) they wheel me to the surgery room and put me under.\n\nI wake up and surgery is done. No more pain. But I knew that was only half of it.\n\nI had to wait until the next morning before they could give me an okay to leave. Shooting me morphine every 2 hours I was awake. \n\nThe next day after the doctor gave me a visit and finally the okay to go we left around 5pm to head home. We only found out afterwards that the total came out to $39,000.\n\nI have no idea how I can come up with so much. Over $120 thousand in student debt, another 1000 for a flu visit years prior. I can&#039;t even afford to pay for a cellphone, rent, or food.\n\nMy girlfriend has been doing all of this to keep us going for the last few months as I look for a job. I work as an intern with no pay at a university, volunteer to work on two different modding communities to produce artwork, and have to produce personal pieces to better bolster my portfolio.\n\nI feel helpless in these situations and I don&#039;t normally ask for help from anyone. But now I have no where else to turn and I&#039;m trying what I can and need to see if it will help in any way to relieve some of the financial congestion being placed on my girlfriend, her family, and my family.\n\nRight now we could use a shining of hope somewhere. If anybody might have idea&#039;s as to what I could do please comment below so I can read it.","replies":[]}
