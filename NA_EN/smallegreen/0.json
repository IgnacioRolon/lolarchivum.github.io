Then, another player says that he wanted to play Ahri. I said let&#039;s trade then, you take Ahri, I take Lux. We do just that, pick our skins and we start the game. \r\n\r\nNow, the only skin I own for Lux is Star Guardian Lux and the other guy was going to use Challenger Ahri. Loading screen comes up and I&#039;m Imperial Lux and she&#039;s Schoolgirl Ahri. Thought it was just a random glitch that had random skins pop up for us,so didn&#039;t think much of it.\r\n\r\nWe get in game and, lo and behold, we are Imperial Lux and Schoolgirl Ahri.\r\n\r\nLuckily, we didn&#039;t keep the skins afterwards and I thought Imperial Lux was kind of boring to look at. But, just wanted to let people know that haven&#039;t posted this little problem yet that it&#039;s happened to me and you don&#039;t keep the skin you get stuck with. \r\n\r\nNo Final Boss Veigar for you, no skins for whatever this champ is {{champion:83}}, and no cigar on Graves.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-01-15T22:32:06.889+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Smallegreen,\n\nThanks for the report!
