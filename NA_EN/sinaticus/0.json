That's a Helmet for damn sure but is it Helmet Bro's?\n\nEven if it is, does that mean he's dead, he could of easily escaped the Razorbeaks but Kog is a different story. You can see in the art that Kog seems very curious. Maybe he thinks he landed the shot and he obliterated Helmet Bro or he eat the body leaving the helmet, Kog could of even just stumbled upon this Helmet with his drool. Many questions, yet no answers.\n\nEither way this all proves that the art team has more consistency than any other team at Riot GJ Art team.
