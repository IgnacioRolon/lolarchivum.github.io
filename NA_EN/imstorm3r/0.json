It was because of trolls in promos and he got angry at them and all that sort of bs, tbh i think the trolls should be the ones getting banned for making people angry in the first place. The thing is that i love playing with him and now he is all like mad at the fact that he can't play anymore but he doesn't want to show this and he is just ignorant because of that cuz i know how much he loves this game and how much money he spent on that account but he doesn't show it cuz he's not really that type of person. Is there a way to make him want to start playing LoL agian? I guess the hardest part is getting to level 30 and i was thinking about making him a level 30 account without letting him know so he can start unranked because climbing through silver-gold isn't that hard or a way to get him motivated so he will want to play agian. And please don't come with those arguments like \"he got banned cuz he deserved it\" or \"he shouldn't play anymore\" because i want people to be nice and i just want to help my friend because everyone can get mad sometimes more or less so i just want to know what should i do. :)","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-17T21:31:23.601+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's great that you want to help your friend get back in the game. I can't suggest creating an account for him, since account sharing is pretty frowned upon, but you could definitely play with him to help him level again.","replies":[]}]}
