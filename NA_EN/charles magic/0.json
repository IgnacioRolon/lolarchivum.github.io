So basically, I only play Riven and I was super pumped to pick up some discount Riven skins in &quot;Your Shop&quot;. The first time I opened up my deals I was on a hotspot and my phone died so I only got to open 3 of them then I disconnected. But I saw 2 Riven skins I wanted. Then of course the shop went down for a day..I read an article online stating that you could contact riot to have the deals reinstated. \r\n\r\nSo i open a ticket and I get a reply saying that I NEVER OPENED THE FIRST SET OF DEALS. I wish I would have taken a screenshot. I&#039;m guessing their system doesn&#039;t count your deals as open unless you open them all or something. So disappointed.. then I opened up my 2nd offers.. Was like ok hopefully I see dawnbrigner or championship again. I was honestly hoping for any Riven skin besides dragonblade or crimson elite...  morgana and ahri skins popped up and I have literally 1 game on each of them.. Then of course dragonblade, the one I don&#039;t want. NO IDEA why morg or ahri popped up..\r\n\r\nI REALLY wish I had a picture or some proof so I could get these deals. Really upset with Riot right now. I&#039;ve been a player with you guys for almost 5 years now, given you hundreds of dollars for skins on both of my accounts, and right now i&#039;m just trying to spend more money with you guys and get these skins but i guess it&#039;s not going to happen. \r\n\r\nHonestly, it&#039;s been so hard to get ahold of/talk to riot employees. You can&#039;t call them. They take full days to reply online, they&#039;re rude, and always just reply with a generic cookie-cutter response or a snide remark. I feel like if the company were doing better they would have a phone support line, people to actually read the reports from games, properly trained employees who aren&#039;t rude, more people to reply to support tickets so you don&#039;t have to wait 2 days for each reply, etc. If the company keeps in the direction it&#039;s going, I might have to say goodbye, and take a trip to the BBB on my way to leave a review hehe.. It&#039;s been a nice five years but I don&#039;t want to continue spending money with a company that doesn&#039;t care about the consumer. Looks like I might be switching back to RS after all.. speaking of which, I get better freaking support over at Old School RS from Jagex.. Let that sink in. Pathetic honestly, this companies support could be so much better. Rant over hehe.. Sorry i&#039;ve just played 5 years and spent a lot of money, sad to have to throw it all down the drain. \r\n\r\nIf anyone even reads this, thanks for your time. Hope you got some good offers.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-21T16:31:26.642+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Withheld, I looked into this personally for you and I wasn't able to find any results as well.  :( What's your ticket number?   Do you recall which Riven skins were presented?  I'm super sorry that your experience with support has been poor, but I promise we're not trying to be rude.  \n\nWe really do try to help when we can, but I honestly wasn't able to yield results of a first set of personalized shops for this account.  Is it possible this could have been on another account?  I'll try and see if I can dig any deeper, and will let you know if I find anything out.  Sorry, friend.  :(\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"charles magic","date":"2017-09-21T16:52:04.979+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Wow you're so much nicer than the other guy haha! YAY! :D \n\nTICKET #31855690\n             #31824841\n \nI believe it was iblitzcrank ( i never play blitz lol ) dawnbringer Riven, and Riven championship 2016. And I haven't played on my other account in at least a year, it wouldn't have been on there. It would have been at night (EST) a few nights ago. My phone died and my hotspot went out, then when I got on the next day to check the other 3 deals and load some RP up (payday [: ) The shop was gone, thats when i googled it and found out that the shop was down for everyone. It said I could submit a ticket and i've been going through hell for these skins haha, I really wanted dawnbringer when it came out but 1800rp is a little steep for me, but i'm confident you can help me and it will be so worth it in the end!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-21T16:46:29.456+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey as an update, it looks like Broporo was also able to assist you in your [previous post](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/2E3TaJ4E-your-shop?comment=0000000100000000).  We dug a bit deeper and verified that the account didn't receive a first set of items and Dawnbringer Riven is a skin which isn't eligible for the personalized shop.  I also want to clarify that we're able to see the cards that were flipped over.  Hopefully your current set of items have some solid deals, though, I'm sorry we couldn't help out more.

I looked into this, and it doesn't seem that Dawnbringer [or any other legendary skin is eligible in that shop](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/115012568988).  We aren't able to change shop items or verify an initial set containing the skins you mention.  I know this has been frustrating for you and not great news, though, you do now have access to new items post reset.  I understand it's not ideal, and hopefully the system can pick up better and more specific options in the future.","replies":[{"poster":"charles magic","date":"2017-09-21T17:07:39.859+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's gotta be something wrong with it, my new skins make no sense.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-21T17:34:42.125+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Super Galaxy Fizz is an [epic skin](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752874), and he was released a while ago so he would be available in the personalized shop.

This whole thing is such a joke. I got skins for champions I don't even play. It's like you guys word things a certain way so that even if you contradict it, you can still weasel your way out of it. I never thought id say it but I really regret playing this game and buying skins from you guys. The way you conduct business is so backwards. The customer doesnt care how much you know until they know how much you care. And you guys don't give a crap. Thank you for your time and i'm sorry we couldn't resolve this issue. To review you guys would i go to the better business bureau or the california attorney general?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-21T17:49:48.800+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been completely visible with you the entire time, as well as the specialists in your ticket.  I also personally looked into this for, reached out to internal teams to dig deeper, and addressed your concerns the best we could.  We do care and make every effort to help when we can, though I'm sorry this situation has been frustrating for you.  It's also disheartening to see that you are now selecting to go around these boards and mislead other players who are needing help.

It says on the \"Your shop is back!\" Post that \n\n\"Your Shop opens with six deals on champs or skins handpicked for you by a really smart robot\nThese deals only exist in Your Shop, so you won’t see them anywhere else in the store\nUltimate, Legendary, and Limited skins are not featured in Your Shop\nLegacy skins not featured in the store may be available in Your Shop (ﾉ^ヮ^)ﾉ*:・ﾟ✧\nRelatively new champs or skins won’t be in Your Shop (e.g., Super Galaxy, etc.)\"\n\nObviously there's something wrong because I got super galaxy fizz offered in my shop ( i can screenshot if you want), and my cousin got super galaxy kindred offered in his. He said the first time he opened his (pre-fix) there was project yi, which is legendary. I think someone needs to figure out what's going on because obviously the results of Your Shop isnt matching what you guys said..","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"charles magic","date":"2017-09-21T17:01:49.884+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"and unfortunately no lol, my current deals are garbage. Ahri and Morgana skins are on there for some reason and I think i've played literally 1 game of both. I don't think i'll be needing the good luck, every ticket i've ever submitted has been a joke and I told myself if I get screwed again i'm just hitting up the better business bureau and retiring back to runescape lol. I wish YOU the best of luck on the rift though sir, I hope you carry some good games. It's been a good 5 years guys. gg wp to my hundreds spent on skins {{item:3070}}","replies":[]}]}
