Seeing as every other Ultimate skin besides {{champion:81}} has at least 3. Udyr has bear foram, turtle, phynix and tiger profile banner(or background whatever it's called). Same thing for DJ sona. If there is no plan to have these icons have unique backgrounds I seriously want a refund.

Same would go for champion select - you would only see the one (light form) splash/motion graphic.\n\nSplashes can take a month+ each to complete, and cannot be rendered until the final models and textures are complete. If we opted for ten splashes, Elementalist Lux wouldn't have been announced or available until next year. Early on, we opted for do one splash (light because it's the form she starts in) and then hint to the other elements in the stained glass behind her.","replies":[{"poster":"Xiao Angie","date":"2019-02-22T06:25:11.196+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Riot KateyKhaos! I was also wondering why the background didn't change so I came to this thread. I was unsure if I should send a ticket about it or just post it here, but... If you go to the skins collection and you go to the Theme Features which replaces the description of the skin, the last point clearly states that the skin has \"Five exclusive icons which grant dynamic profile background\"\n\nWhile I understand why you have decided not to go through with this feature, I think this point should either be taken out or it should just exclude the part talking about dynamic profile backgrounds because this particular point chose me to buy elementalist lux over project sona and if I had known that it would not be included I would have changed my mind.\n\nThanks!!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Attysu The Poro","date":"2016-11-29T02:26:06.599+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"There's only one animated splash for Elementalist Lux. .w.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JustMonika13","date":"2016-11-29T02:30:33.317+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Only one Splash art for Elementalist Lux.

Four is still reasonable enough when the goal is profit.\n\nIf Elementalist Lux skin flopped, that would have been a shit ton of money lost for TEN (again, TEN) splash arts.\n\nEdit: Also, Riot also straight out stated that they're not going to make 10 different splash art for Elementalist Lux.

They have to take the safest route possible. Even if it were a huge success, it would have to sell extremely, extremely well just to make back what was spent on it if Riot did make 10 separate splash arts.\n\nNot to mention the massive amount of time that would have to spent on them.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Terreden","date":"2017-01-11T18:42:34.346+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Then why not do the five that come with the skin (not the bundle) at least{{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}}","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"TheLastKamikaze","date":"2017-10-12T01:40:01.632+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Like yeah i spent 40$ on this i was really hoping for a different splash for each ;-;","replies":[]}]}
