Not to mention i have \"ASUS VG248QE 24\" Full HD 1920x1080 144Hz 1ms HDMI Gaming Monitor\". Y in gods name cant i run league of legends on 144 fps, with absolutely no problems?

Actually, this may be caused for a few reasons which are mostly settings or outside sources.  As an example, a recent Windows update auto-enabled the [Xbox Game Bar](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html).  Unfortunately, it's causing big fps issues for some players.  Disabling that as your first step could do the trick!  \n\nIf you still have any issues, use our [FPS issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209010626-Frame-Skipping-on-High-End-PCs) to troubleshoot and make sure that everything is setup properly to run smoothly.  Also as a heads up, keep in mind that we may be unable to support higher resolutions or 4K, so you may need to try reducing that.   Hopefully, these steps get you fixed up!","replies":[{"poster":"Horny Mailman","date":"2016-12-05T02:35:19.443+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"okay thanks ill check that out","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sikuba","date":"2016-09-30T18:49:52.672+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, at least in my laptop I have pre-included Intel graphics card as well as my 970m. I had some issues with another game running at awful fps at lowest settings, so I checked my gpu settings and found that I was running on the Intel graphics by default. Switched that and now get beautiful fps at max settings. Perhaps your issue could be similar.. ?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sega And Chill","date":"2016-09-30T03:17:47.540+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not real sure what the prolbem could be have you tried checking or unchecking the boxes at the bottom like the vertical sync?
