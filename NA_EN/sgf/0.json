If telia and riot already have it in their hands before it spikes what does contacting my isp solve or what information do i hope to gain from them other than the typical \"its not us\" kind of response? what am i missing here?\n\nlas-b21-link.telia.net hands off to dls-b21-link.telia.net, so thats telia handing it to somewhere else on its own network and its spiking, then again spikes to nearly double when dls-b21-link.telia.net hands it to riot-ic-315570-dls-b21.c.telia.net. \n\nedit- what kind of information do i need to request/provide and what kind of direction do i need to give them that would improve this situation, i guess im just not seeing the correct course of action once i contact them outside of simply saying here is a trace route i have can you fix this...?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-31T15:21:24.006+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there, your copy of this log should be escalated to a higher-tier specialist with your ISP who can review the impacted node causing the increase.  They should be able to send someone out there to take a look at it, if the issue still persists.
