It&#039;s commonly called the &quot;Tank meta&quot; but i think this is a bit of a misnomer, because almost every lane and champion archetype  is in a good place. Tanks are finally viable, but they aren&#039;t so strong they push other classes out. Because tanks can finally peel again, ADC&#039;s are good again. Because ADC&#039;s are good again, assassins are still strong but not overbearing. Because Assassins are not overbearing, it doesn&#039;t feel like shit to pick mages. Champion diversity is the best its been in a long time. Finally i&#039;m not seeing Lee Sin literally every damn game... and you didn&#039;t have to nerf lee to oblivion for it to happen! It seems their are very few OP picks that are stifling diversity. \r\n\r\nI find myself watching LCS again after about a year. It&#039;s not the same small pool of champions over and over and over. You can no longer reliably predict who wins the match after the first 10 minutes. We&#039;ve seen the rise of support Nautilus, top Morgana, support kennen and FREAKING URGOT in competitive play. This speaks volumes about how well you&#039;re accomplishing your stated goals this year. Hell i&#039;m watching Bjergsen wreck C9 with AP Kogmaw in the finals right now. \r\n\r\nBalance is far from perfect. Old champions need work, itemization could be better, etc, but you guys are on the right track. These are the kinds of changes i&#039;ve been waiting whole seasons for. Thanks from a long time player.","replies":[{"poster":"Goodest Gamer","date":"2015-04-19T23:04:57.980+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":73,"body":"\"tanks are now viable\". what are you talking about? tanks are the only type of champs that can be played top and jungle now. everyone else gets shti on.","replies":[{"poster":"Phoenix Kotori ","date":"2015-04-19T23:20:40.415+0000","up_votes":41,"down_votes":2,"body":"{{champion:68}} {{champion:117}} {{champion:8}} aren't tanks and are top tier for top lane.","replies":[{"poster":"Goodest Gamer","date":"2015-04-19T23:23:36.374+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":50,"body":"? what do they have in common? lets see. ability power. what else do they have in common? ranged poke and skillsets. every single ad melee bruiser has been completely shut down by tanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Phoenix Kotori ","date":"2015-04-19T23:30:05.737+0000","up_votes":42,"down_votes":2,"body":"{{champion:39}} {{champion:120}} {{champion:254}} {{champion:150}}","replies":[{"poster":"r11na","date":"2015-04-19T23:39:08.797+0000","up_votes":27,"down_votes":2,"body":"Thank you.\n\nWas about to reply with this very post. \nIrelia and Hecarim are top tier top laners, and via is still a beast in the jungle.\n\nSome people are just clueless or blind when it comes to this game though.\n\nEdit: LOL Sharmoota is a riven player, that explains a lot.\n\nHis Riven gets shat on and interprets this as meaning every single ad melee bruiser has been shut down by tanks.","replies":[{"poster":"FedAsFuk","date":"2015-04-20T02:37:03.913+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":3,"body":"I am a Riven player, and the current meta is really against Riven, but it isn't overbearing. It makes laning much less snowbally. I do think alot of burst AD bruisers are crippled in the current meta, because of the ability to keep carries safe with tanks and mega shields, but they are not unplayable. It just makes it very challenging, but surviving as a low HP/armor/MR burst damage champ should be hard.\n\n\nBut overall burst seems to be way less viable, which is why assassins are really out right now. Are assassins unplayable? No are the viable targets for assassins much rarer? Yes, Mid laners are now even tanky (see Urgot and Cho) JG has mega tanks, top is also mega tanks, is the diversity perfect? No, but it is different, which is a step in the right direction. IDK how they could bring burst back, maybe kick the scaling of tanks a bit? Make assassin less easily counterable? Assassin referring to alot of of burst casters, Zed, Riven, Yasuo (mostly his own kits fault not ENTIRELY the meta) are 3 examples.\n\nOh and for those who will say Zed was played in the LCS he is viable, look at the targets available to him? Some mid laners, and the ADC, both of which ALWAYS get Zhonya's or QSS, or the support gets crucible, effectively killing Zeds ability to 100-0. \n\nEither way, you can play Riven still, it is just hard as fuck.","replies":[{"poster":"B1naryB0t","date":"2015-04-20T02:43:39.292+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":3,"body":"obligatory no one likes you riven","replies":[]},{"poster":"Space Bum","date":"2015-04-20T13:35:06.775+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've never thought anyone should be able to 100-0.

Without their burst it would be the Protect the Vayne vs Protect the Kog comp every game with top mega tanks JG with peel (sej and nunu/gragas) mid with shields (ori lulu karma etc.) supports with sustain/peel to keep the carry in lane (nami Janna (shield with AP Janna can keep you in lane surprisingly well) and soraka) and of course ADC Vayne/kog/Jinx? and it would have very limited counterplay if you remove the ability to 100-0.\n\nNow should every champ be able to instakill? No, should champs designed to deal very high burst damage very fast and then be relatively less impactful rest of the fight be able to 100-0? Yes, because without that they lose their usefulness.
