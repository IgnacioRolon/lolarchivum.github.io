The date they plan is Wednesday but it's not at all rare that the patch goes out on Thursday because something cropped up, and it was less than a year ago that they had a patch on a Friday.\n\nThe internal date planned will be Wednesday but they can't say that for sure because it only ends up being on Wednesday like 60% of the time.","replies":[{"poster":"Kürama","date":"2016-05-03T01:28:00.587+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> **[Network Operations](http://status.leagueoflegends.com/?en_US#na)** \n\n> On 05/04/16, starting at, 01:30 Pacific Time (08:30 UTC), ranked queues will be disabled in preparation for patch 6.9.
