Its very balanced but it scales with level so there would be no difference between a bad velkoz player and a good velkoz player landing 3 skillshots within 7 secs of each other. My idea is to make velkoz be able to infinitely stack true damage!\r\nI got this idea from watching the velkoz champion spotlight and I remember phreak saying that velkoz learns how to hurt his enemies more efficiently. That&#039;s not the case though since it scales with level. My idea is each time velkoz lands a skillshot, the enemy gets a permanent stack, or X, and X should be added to a new true damage formula: 10+10(velkoz&#039;s level)+ (a % of X). Maybe the formula should be tweaked. Then when velkoz lands 3 skillshots within 7 secs ( like how it is currently), the extra true damage would be added. This will help velkozs late game since he has low scalings and rewards players who know how to land skill shots well. This may make marksman velkoz popular since he could apply 2 stacks to 2 targets at the same time and make top lane velkoz popular because of the tanks. The true damage will vary amongst enemies since X is dependent on how many times velkoz has landed a skill shot to that enemy in the game. Remember its just an idea. What do you guys think? Anything you would change?","replies":[{"poster":"MisterHealYoGirl","date":"2015-11-03T02:37:42.930+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, a bad Velks player will do the same damage as a good one if they land three skillshots, but a good one is a lot more likely to do that.

Our conclusion for ones with repeated stacking, was that, if the effect was strong enough to be noticeable, that it led to situations where you were really effective against whoever you'd laned against and felt ineffective against other targets.\n\nAs far as the difference between a good and a bad player goes I'd argue there that a good player is one who manages to land those three hits. The skill test's in getting the combo off, rather than in the game leading up to that moment (in contrast with stacking champions like Nasus or Kindred who have much more reliable ways to leverage their stacking damage, so need to be tested on their ability to stack as well).","replies":[{"poster":"Erockandroll","date":"2015-11-03T21:17:20.416+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=qre0GEQz,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-11-03T02:45:28.850+0000)\n>\n> We spent a while looking at various 'learn how to fight specific people' abilities during Vel'koz's original development.

(like you did with Lux) That way, Vel'koz doesn't feel completely gimped about not scaling well with AP. Giving him a little more presence in the mid lane and not being relegated to the support role.","replies":[{"poster":"7ha7guy777","date":"2015-11-03T21:24:59.388+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you think of Vel's kit in terms of a full combo (QWEQRW) not a full rotation, he actual has a massive ap ratio as well as up to 820 true damage 615 of which is AoE.
