In almost every game i've tried to play i've randomly started lagging and hitting upwards of 20k ping at some point in the match which ends up disconnecting me and reconnecting me constantly. My internet works fine apart from that and I don't have any other devices being used and I NEVER have that problem/much lag. I almost never lag when I play and if I do it's solely because something is downloading in the background and then it gets stopped immediately and the ensuing lag is gone. \r\n\r\nI've restarted my router constantly to no avail so I have no idea what else I could possibly do to fix it short of calling my ISP and sounding like a jackass if they say my internet is working fine.","replies":[{"poster":"Son of Ornn","date":"2017-08-06T03:33:49.983+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are also a couple steps you could try out as well to assure there aren't other Connection issues that might be interfering with LoL!
