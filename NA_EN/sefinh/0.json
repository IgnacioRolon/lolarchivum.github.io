Initially it told me that it could not download the files, then it told me that it could not locate the game to spectate.\r\n\r\nI select \"spectate game\" it loads just a black screen, does nothing for quite some time, then says in a window entitled \"Request Failed\" \"Spectator server data request failed. The game will now exit.\" I clicked okay and it went back to \"You have left a game in progress\" with reconnect or quit as options. The first time it gave me two error messages and then I had to use task manager to exit the spectating mode.","replies":[{"poster":"amd098","date":"2014-11-20T05:45:28.976+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"same here, spectate does not work.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sefinh","date":"2014-11-20T05:34:55.350+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh, I would just like to say that the new jungle items look really cool, but I've only used one so far, and Kalista's interactions are really cool :D (She linked to  me as Diana) Looking forward to playing her.
