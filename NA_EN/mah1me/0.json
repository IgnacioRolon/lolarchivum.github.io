If you convincingly pretend to committ a crime in public and somebody calls the cops on you, you'll still get in trouble.\n\n>What happened to the freedom of speech?\n\nNothing. Literally nothing.

No, it's not ok to punish me for that with a permanent \"we never want to see you again\"-ban.\n\nLet's ignore the permanent ban for now (since once again: Nope. Not happening.) and focus on the first bit: Thankfully we live in a society where even things that do not literally end somebody's life are punished, because honestly, comparing things to murder is about the lowest bar you could possibly set for moral standards.\n\n>If this pace keeps up, in 2020 we're not allowed to speak anymore.\nMaking a baron call will get you banned, since you're telling other people what to do.

Offensive as fuck.\n\nIf we don't punish toxicity in 2020 League of Legends will be replaced in its entirety by real-life fights to the death while we sacrifice babies to Satan.\nSee?

Not actually happening.\n\n>Yet we keep the chat enabled, and no we don't have an option to disable it.\n\nYou could just mute everybody, but hey, simply blaming somebody else for not catering to your inability to control yourself to the slightest extent is even easier than that, I suppose.\n\n>Oh and you are free to create a$ many new account$ a$ you want after being permanently banned, we don't mind at all, ju$t make $ure to buy the late$t champion$ $o you're not too far behind from other player$.\n\nWhat do you suggest to actually keep people out of the game? If you can find a feasible method that cannot be circumvented with the know-how equivalent to one minute of googling that doesn't punish innocents I'm sure Riot will implement it in a heart beat.\n\nSeriously all of these things have been mentioned before... none of them are logically sound and some of them are straight up objectively false.

There are multiple punishments before the permanent ban step, and players go through each of them before finally being permanently banned (though more extreme behavior can skip a few punishment tiers). Calling someone an idiot once will only net you a chat restriction, if any punishment at all. If you get permanently banned for calling someone an idiot, then you would have gone through the other punishments beforehand warning you that your behavior is unacceptable, and yet you still refuse to change it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Arammus","date":"2017-11-18T00:24:55.930+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://puu.sh/wMbMc/886fcfe7e8.jpg\nhttps://puu.sh/xNDhn/999afaaabb.jpg","replies":[]},{"poster":"CrazFight ","date":"2017-11-17T20:38:12.742+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Wont get banned for telling someone there an idiot \"once\"\nNo way for riot to know if you two are friends, all they see is you telling someone to kill themselves. \nThis freedom of speech argument is getting annoying, yes freedom of speech protects you when u say something public, but riot is a private company and can control what is said in there game.
