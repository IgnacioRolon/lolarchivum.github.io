I kindred main and i think not u can say kindred is a noob champ compared to how muh time u saw kindred players. People say there are like &quot;combos&quot; or &quot;techniques&quot; for these champs. I was like &quot;ok&quot; so i wanted to see a yasuo tuto.\r\nThen i saw that on of the combos was litteraly &quot;Flash+ Auto Attack&quot; -__- seriously... thx for the tip man. Then i realized all the combos shawed were actually normal different bursts. And it&#039;s the same for all the cahmps in the list. u spam ur spells (with balanced damage ofc) and u win.\r\nThe builds also. Akali can have OP lifesteal with only 1 item.\r\nWell im tired of these guys saying they play difficult champs, spamming masterie 7 and teabagging when i played all of them and i can tell they&#039;re nooby AF.\r\nComment if u think so and if ur a lux main, well go away xD","replies":[{"poster":"Warlord Rhinark","date":"2018-07-04T12:45:17.410+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let me hit you with one of those hard to swallow pills:\n\n****All champions in League takes skill to a certain extent.****\n\nThere are no \"noob\" champions.
