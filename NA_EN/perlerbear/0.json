Like the game is going in slow motion)","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Recently today I hopped in my Silver 2 series and lost the first one due to a problem that is very foreign to me. I have been experiencing a frequent issue today where the game seems to rubber band/slow down/ jerk, it makes the game unplayable, this would be explainable if I was experiencing lag but no my FPS is at a constant 143-144 (when it drops to 143 that is when it lags most of the time) and a ping measure of 35-39 ms. I have ran speed test and ping test to no avail. I have tried everything I can think of e.g . updating invidia drivers, changing settings like enabling V-Sync, but to success. I would like to know if any of you fellow summoners are experiencing this issue. Also if you have any solutions or tips for me! Thank you for reading!","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-20T05:05:02.560+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The symptoms you've described are very common to *Packet Loss* or *Extreme Packet Buffering*.
