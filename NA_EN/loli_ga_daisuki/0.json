Changing the screens resolution does not help as it changes depending on what the game res is set on. \r\n\r\nHere are my problems: \r\nThe high resolution causes many features of LoL to become ridiculously small such as the Health bars, Minimap Icons and the mouse cursor.\r\nLowering the resolution causes the screen to stretch, or not cover the entire screen, or become extremely unsmooth and cause jagged edges.\r\n\r\nI'm not willing to download any 3rd party programs but I am willing to change game files if I have to.\r\n\r\nThanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-05T03:53:55.161+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately, League doesn't offer full 4K support at the moment. The UI elements you mentioned, specifically the mouse and minimap icons will scale differently than other UI elements for some 4K players. Some players have found luck running the game in Full Screen mode and not *Alt+Tabbing* out, as switching to another app will often cause the UI scaling to go wacky again. If that doesn't work for you, you'll have to set both your Windows and in-game display resolutions to something like 1920x1080 or 1920x1200 in order to experience properly scaling UI while playing League.\n\nI don't have an ETA or timeline on when League will have additional support for 4K, but please let me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}
