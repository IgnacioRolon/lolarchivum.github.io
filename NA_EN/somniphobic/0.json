And really there isnt really anything I can do myself. I can't speak to a rioter either in person or any other way besides the boards and the basically near useless ticket system. (At least to my knowledge) Also, I have made a few posts asking how long they will take or just describing my situation to riot in hopes of actually getting my account, yet the only replies are \"send in a ticket\" or something else. I even had a reply saying that they saw my ticket but u have had no reply for an entire day even after that. I'm really losing hope in riot.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-23T23:17:04.266+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"When you submit an account recovery form, it goes to a specialist- a human one.  Unless you are contacted by Blitzbot, but there's  speak to a human request if he does.  Our account team takes recovery very seriously, and they won't restore an account unless they are absolutely sure it's being restored to the owner.  If you didn't pass, it's okay!  Fill out another [account recovery form](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=72416) and try again.  They'll help you out, just be ready to verify your ownership.  Good luck!","replies":[]}]}
