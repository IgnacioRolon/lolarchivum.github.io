As you can see I am posting  from my account but that is because I never logged out from this website, so it is clear my account still exists. Yet when I sent in a ticket at 11:00 am this morning I haven't gotten a reply yet. All I require is to change my email my current account us linked to, yet I cannot do this, seeing that I do not own the email and my password doesn't work. I'm only asking for this email change yet I have been waiting nearly 7 hours. Not to mention I already made a post asking for some help on the issue and got a reply from a rioter saying to send them a ticket, to which I replied that I had 5 hours ago. Still receiving no replies I really started getting worked up and am really hoping maybe a rioter can see this new post and help me change the email so I can change my password back and have some more fun?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-22T04:12:16.035+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry I couldn't get to this post sooner, but I do see your tickets in the queue. As I said in my other response, sending more tickets doesn't push you ahead in line. If anything it could actually slow down the response time. A little patience can go a long way, and those agents will be able to help shortly.","replies":[{"poster":"Somniphobic","date":"2017-05-22T21:55:59.710+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How will I know when one of my tickets gets a reply, or when my email is changed?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-23T01:37:17.355+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You should be getting an email sent when they respond!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Somniphobic","date":"2017-05-22T04:16:44.810+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had submitted more tickets because in each ticket I changed something up, and was hopefully maybe getting a faster response with more info. I also didn't exactly expect it would basically take up the whole day waiting for a response either, I was just really hopeing to play some games this weekend with all the new skins and champs I got.","replies":[]}]}]}
