Plus it is not like i have not been playing, I have played quite a reasonable amount since they were released and have been in teams if not myself that achieved S rank.\r\n\r\nAny Ideas?","replies":[{"poster":"RiotBok","date":"2016-05-10T20:00:10.982+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Chests definitely aren't a temporary feature! I looked into your account a bit and I'm not seeing anything super strange at the moment.  I don't have information on your most recent of games yet, but looking at your account it seems that, for the most part, it's just no one in your premade is earning an S rank.\n\nThe only time I see anything different is a Leona game about a month ago in which you or your team earned an S rank, but you had already earned a chest on Leona.\n\nIf there's anything specific you think is weird, happy to look into it, but don't see anything right now.","replies":[]}]}
