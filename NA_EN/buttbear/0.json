Once in a while when you play a game you struggle against a lane. The thing you hope for is that your jungler is coming to help you out isn&#039;t it?\r\n\r\nI just finished such game. I was adc and had some struggle cause of zed support. My mid lane was fed and top lane they both had no problems at all. Sow i pinged a lot of times for help on my lane. There was no answer on it, our jungler just went top and mid. Quite werid gaking lanes who are already winning when there is a lane that is losing but okey. Then i asked in chat for some help. There was no repsoinse. I saked a few more time still no gank! he kept going mid and top. Who got more fed and the jungler himself too. I was really getting behin cause of zed ults that where destroying me and had to back. I started to ping ask everything to get attention.\r\n\r\nThen i just gave up and slowly there bot lane was getting more fed by farm and and 3 kills total. I got sow behind i couldn&#039;t do anything anymore. I was dead before i was alive again sow hard behind. That moment my whole team was starting to flame me. Sow i started to refuse helping them too. We lost ofcourse... cause yeah having a adc and supp sow hard behind... isnt going to help you win a game.\r\n\r\nSow my question is it really my fault i lost or is it the junglers fault for refusing intentionaly to help me? And how just how do i get attention of a jungler for ganks cause this happens sow many times now!!\r\nThis is for me the main reason i hate junglers...\r\n\r\nnote: that if i go good on a lane i&#039;m honored in the number of ganks.\r\n\r\nsow last point: Its the job of a jungler to gank winning lanes and destroy the lanes totaly who are losing? then just remove the lane totaly cause then its of no use at all..","replies":[{"poster":"Droogzy","date":"2015-09-26T14:13:12.547+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Junglers can't be in every lane. At most they can help 1 or 2 lanes effectively, depending on the mobility of their champion. \n\nFrom the sound of it, he decided the mid and top laners were of more value. Especially considering you were losing, if a lane is winning, you want to capitalize on that, the jungler can get gold easily and the lane can win even harder which makes closing the game out easier. In the process you are effectively removing a laner from the other team. \n\nThere's sometimes very little to be gained ganking losing lanes unless its just a slight difference. Especially one with a zed support, thats just a kill lane and can be dangerous, especially if the lane is behind. \n\nAlso, even if you're getting pushed in, you should still be warding, even if its somewhere around red camp, or tribush, etc. Wards should be going up. A smart jungler is not going to waste time with going to a dark zone.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TeemoJenkins","date":"2015-09-26T14:03:11.396+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey OP I'm here with a really big problem and it's about you.  http://wardscore.loltools.net/?name=ButtBear%20&region=euw you aren't warding, which likely means you're getting ganked because you're pushing the lane and don't have vision and then blaming the jungler.  Might want to work on making sure your six is covered before you blame a team mate.","replies":[{"poster":"ButtBear","date":"2015-09-26T14:06:31.523+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Seriously i'm pushed in under turret... there is no way for me to ward cause then i would have gone over extending on lane and totaly fed them. I'm not to dumb to do that.\n\nand for your information i play not much with wards but more with sweeping lense to clean the map from them...","replies":[{"poster":"HentRex","date":"2015-09-26T14:10:06.418+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"He's not talking about just this game.

What you can ask for is to help zone them off and put some pressure on, and farm up the difference. Hell, sometimes you don't want to risk the all-in if it means trading a kill (imagine if your jungler got the kill, but your lane opponent killed you. Now you're further behind). \n\nSometimes you need to focus on not losing lane rather than trying to win it. Wait for the late-game if you have to. If top and mid gets fed to hell and the jungler has plenty of gold, you should be fine and protected during teamfights even if you're not dealing as much damage. \n\nSnowballing two winning lanes is more worth the jungler's time than trying to reset a lane. I'm sorry, but the jungler has to be pragmatic here.","replies":[]},{"poster":"COWmanLord","date":"2015-09-27T01:32:17.333+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Frequently yes, the jungler does want to gank winning lanes as the chance of them actually getting something out of the gank is substantially higher. A losing lane can be much harder to actually bring back especially when you have something like zed support which does not bring much to the gank. Also it can be tricky to keep pressure on all three lanes at once. I know I frequently end up focusing on one or two lanes for the most part as covering the entire map is not always an easy task.\n\nOne word of advice though. The word you are looking for is so. Sow is another word that means to plant seeds by scattering them on the earth. It is also a name for a female pig.\nhttp://img02.deviantart.net/8020/i/2010/323/9/3/the_more_you_know_by_stathisnhx-d33639v.png","replies":[]},{"poster":"facemelter710","date":"2015-09-27T01:13:52.905+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a jg main. Ganking a Fed zed. Usually makes him more fed. He will shadow out or flash. then 1 shot whoever decides 2 follow him close 2 tower.That being said if he was pushed up bot lane depending what champ was on your team. He would have been killable. Its a hard call to make.  You should take responsibility for feeding an enemy assn and not expect ganks If you do. It becomes your job to group with the more fed players of your team. And try to end laning phase before that champ gets 2 fed in lane. Also hard 2 do because this community knows nothing of teamwork. Most of us are nerds who have never been on an actual team. of any sort. also. not only your jgler should be roaming. everyone should work as a team. if jg is ganking top. maybe mid lane can gank bot. So many variables bet that is just a minor example.","replies":[]},{"poster":"khorney","date":"2015-09-26T14:19:22.896+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its not really wierd its more of help a lane that are fed to put pressure purposes","replies":[]},{"poster":"Trash MammaI","date":"2015-09-26T14:18:19.646+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Depending on how hard you're struggling in lane it's probably better to pretend you don't exist. If you've died at lot your gold worth is lower, if we gank and get you a kill only to have your gold reset and the enemy continues to feast upon your insides we're just feeding them more gold. \n\nIf a lane is doing so horrible it's better to get another lane winning hard and snowballing to the point they can roam freely and gank opposite lanes from us. Doing so establishes dominance. Letting for easier drag controls easier sieges etc. \n\nOur job early on isn't to keep you from being roflstomped in lane. It's to apply early pressure and tip the early game in our teams favor so that mid-late game they can be of use when it comes to objectives. \n\nAs a shaco main I hate laners. I'm constantly counter jungling and tracking every step of the enemy junglers and don't usually spend much time ganking unless I see an easy kill. I get so much shit for it","replies":[]},{"poster":"MintChipHomieLix","date":"2015-09-26T14:08:31.058+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Change name from ButtBear to ButtHurt.","replies":[]}]}
