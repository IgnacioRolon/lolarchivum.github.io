Then I played a game as Caitlyn ADC. Almost everytime I ulted someone or got them low enough to kill them, that person used Zhonya&#039;s so that their team could kill me. It&#039;s like a get out of jail free card but only for AP champs. \r\n\r\nSo I&#039;d like to suggest a AD item with the same active. It shouldn&#039;t have as much AD as a regular damage item, because then assassins would abuse it. Wait, this kinda sounds like Guardian Angel, so this item I&#039;m talking about should probably replace GA or be a different item from GA. That&#039;s all I have to say and tell me what you think about it.\r\n\r\nHAVE A GREAT DAY","replies":[{"poster":"Speak or Die","date":"2018-12-02T03:57:14.996+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"GA is the AD version of Zhonyas.","replies":[{"poster":"LightningShado","date":"2018-12-02T04:39:30.273+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Speak or Die,realm=OCE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=cs69hIXX,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-12-02T03:57:14.996+0000)\n>\n> GA is the AD version of Zhonyas.\n\nGA passive has a 300 second cooldown.
