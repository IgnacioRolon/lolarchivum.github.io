It will also walk you through the in-game tutorials and your first battles on the Fields of Justice. From competition against the bots to your first head to head experience, the new player guide will help you learn the skills you need to take on other summoners.","url":"http://gameinfo.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/game-info/get-started/","image":"https://lolstatic-a.akamaihd.net/game-info/1.1.9/images/content/npg-champions.jpg"},"up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know this isn't a big priority to Riot right now, and I'm not saying it should be, but the League website needs some updating. For new players, the website isn't actually representing what is in the game and that could throw people off along with the large learning curve that League has. For example the starting champions on the website have the old Warwick and Ryze splashes and the old Rift Herald description and picture. \r\n\r\nThat's here: http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/new-player-guide?source=http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/site/guide/#/how-to-win/epic-monsters?_k=j9lsef \r\n\r\nWhen trying to get my dad to play League he complains that he doesn't understand it and I think that the tutorial videos don't give the necessary information in an understandable manner to any players that are new to video games. I'm thinking about making a tutorial series explaining how to play League from start to finish, and I most likely will, but I'm sick right now and my voice sounds like crap.\r\n\r\nI know this is a minor issue and Riot is focusing on new content for players that are already invested, but It would help to make some changes. Tutorial videos will be coming soon on my channel, hopefully, but only when I feel better and my voice is good. (Who knows when that'll be...) Leave the videos to me Riot!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-16T22:57:37.654+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the heads up Shado! We're constantly making changes and updating League as the game evolves, but sometimes we might miss something on one of our pages after making crucial changes.
