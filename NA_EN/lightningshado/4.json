I know that at honor 5 you have a chance of getting Medieval Twitch or Grey Warwick, but other than that it doesn&#039;t seem like I get much. I do get ONE key fragment like every week which let&#039;s me slowly get through my pile of hextech chests, but I&#039;ve gotten two honor 5 orbs for the entire time I&#039;ve had it, and I&#039;ve had it for three months. So Riot, could you do me a favor and increase the drop rate on those orbs please? Thank you and thank you people for taking the time to read my post. Tell me whatcha think.\n\nPlease upvote this post. ","replies":[]}
