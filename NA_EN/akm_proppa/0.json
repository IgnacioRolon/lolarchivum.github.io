I was positive it wasn't my internet connection because I was watching the LCS on twitch and everything else was working fine. \r\n\r\nI figured I should leave and restart my client to try and reconnect to the game. However, when I logged back into the client, it didn't bring me to the reconnect screen, it brought me to the normal home page. I was able to actually go in queue and search for a new ranked game despite the game I just left going on.  Now, I am unsure how to reconnect to my game and I might get punished for AFKing when I couldn't even reconnect to the game that stopped working. I really hate when people AFK like everyone else, and now my teammates will have to get a loss and I will probably get a punishment or ban when it's out of my control.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know what I can do to in case this happens again or how to get a punishment revoked if i get a temporary ban?\r\n{{item:3070}}  {{item:3070}}  {{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-09T21:55:49.450+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey I looked into this, and it looks like our server might have failed to pick up the game.  It's super rare but it can happen, and it would act as if it the match happened.  You shouldn't get a penalty or anything as a result.  Is everything okay now?","replies":[]}]}
