OP's 14-day ban may have been just, but, I don't think that appealing it would have led to an escalated punishment (unless they were particularly irritable about it), and it's horribly unlikely that OP was trying to point out some \"crippling flaw\" and Riot decided to shut him down in the hopes that that \"flaw\" wouldn't come to light.\n\nWhat I think happened is as follows: OP gets a valid 14-day ban for bad behavior, OP sends support ticket, Support Agent feels that the OP's account may have been compromised (and the person who may/may not have jacked the account was the one who earned the 14-day), and so the Support Agent placed a shield ban on OP's account.\n\nTo me, that just kinda makes the most sense.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"LuluTopSionMid","date":"2018-05-05T00:26:21.419+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":4,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MagicFlyingLlama,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=fyhhg7iE,comment-id=0000000000000000,timestamp=2018-05-05T00:21:47.544+0000)\n>\n> Not what happened.
