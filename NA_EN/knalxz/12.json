Imagine if League just no longer had ranked and the LCS, that's pretty much what happened in an instant. It was weird for alot of Halo players but we still kept going and having fun but we still were missing out competition.  So until until late 2013 did i hear that 343i was going back to a more skillful Halo.\r\n\r\nPart of the reason why they did this was from the Leagues world finals. So stroked my beard and said, \"WTF is \"League of Legends.\"So in January i started playing to see if 343i was taking a leap in the right direction and in terms of skill the Leagues exactly the something that Bungie had in Halo 2 and 3.\r\n\r\nVery excited for Halo stepping back to its roots i'd sort of like to give a thanks to Riot. My most favorite game is now getting back on track and to be honest from what I've seen you guys need to as well. I've only been playing League for 10 months but others who've been playing since 2009 feel really ripped apart by how you're changing things. I don't know how longs its been going on but just to save you guys from entering a Dark Age like many other series, just keep to what your fans are after. That's all i can say. \r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpftOphhJfk","replies":[]}
