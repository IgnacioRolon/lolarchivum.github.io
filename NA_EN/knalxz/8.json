Darius wants what's best for his people. People can like him because he's out for his fellow man. Nautilus in a way isn't a villain at all, he's just a guy who got left behind and wants revenge. He's reasonably pissed, another reason why he's one of my favorite champions. The majority of champions I own is only because of how they are in lore. I find it hard to side with the person who's argument for justice is an eye for an eye. With that logic everyone should be a slave again because Africans weren't ever the only slaves and aren't the last. slavery is still a thing today yet people seem to go a little blind to it.
