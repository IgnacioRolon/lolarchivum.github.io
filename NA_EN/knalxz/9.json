It'd be like if a series named \"dragons are awesome\" had king kong stomp like 10 dragons down in the middle of it.","replies":[{"poster":"A Superb Villain","date":"2015-04-04T16:21:57.987+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes and no; while I agree introducing a character that defeats the resident badasses solely to exemplify their superiority is a poor decision, doing so to remind audiences the heroes are not infallible is perfectly reasonable.\n\nIn relation to Grievous' introduction, the Jedi had already dealt with countless droids, survived a crash landing, and were still fighting off an overwhelming force. They were _exhausted_ by the time Grievous arrived, and he manipulated their fatigue by shaping it into fear, disrupting them. The General had an incredible advantage before even setting foot near the group.\n\nLater episodes depict him as competent, but more importantly, terrifyingly relentless. He was still a threat, but no where near unstoppable as his first appearance made him out to be. Grievous' victories over individual Jedi are, notably, after he has run them into the ground. By being a cybernetic organism, he has the advantage of stamina, capable of outlasting any organic adversary, and he abuses it.\n\nThat relentlessness fit his character. Even prior to becoming the General, he was an exceptional soldier. Having lost many loved ones, witnessed the suffering his people after being denied aid by the Republic, and finally, led to believe the Jedi were the source of all his problems, he became solely focussed on their destruction. He was _remade_ to fulfill that purpose; everything about Grievous was built around eliminating Jedi, so it makes sense he is frighteningly effective against them.\n\nHe had one job: prove that the Jedi were not invincible, and, at least initially, he did.\n\nWe all know the hero wins at the end, that is what stories have led us to believe, and typically, that assumption holds true to this day. But when victory is assured and nothing is at risk, a story becomes boring, we lose any sort of connection to the hero because we _can_ fail, we _do_ lose.\n\nTo end my rambling, I like Grievous because he made me think, \"maybe they can lose\" and that strengthened the investment in learning what happened next. He put the story's outcome in question, and that made it all the more exciting.\n\nPlus, cyborgs are awesome.","replies":[{"poster":"OyddAWqJ5r","date":"2015-04-04T20:16:57.560+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Plus seeing Grievous grab Jedi faces and slam them into the ground was pretty satisfying lol.
