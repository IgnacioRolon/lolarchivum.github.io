Lich Bane) react to Passive abilities, item actives and abilities that place minions?\n\nLich Bane Description- After using an ability, your next basic attack deals 75% base AD (+ 50% AP) bonus magic damage. 1.5 second cooldown.\n\nSo if a champion like Warwick were to turn his E on and off again repeatedly, would he still get the bonus from Sheen? Same goes for Azir's troops attack, is that technically using an ability or how about Zhonyas? Will tehse trigger the Sheen Unique passive within these items?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 2\nWhy are bronze players allowed to be on Gold+ teams?\n\nThis question mainly comes from me joining a ranked team that is gold. We fought in a game with one of the enemies being Diamond 2. After reviewing the rest of the their team one player was Bronze and another silver, both on a Diamond team who fought a gold team in Ranked 3v3.\n\n Does Riot not care about ranked 3v3's or is the ranked system just really messed up?\n\n\n\nQuestion 3 Extra game modes.\nPart 1 Why are featured gamemodes timed?\n\nWhy are they timed. People normally love these gamemodes especially when they are able to ban certain champions. These gamemodes normally will have a huge population, so why doesn't Riot keep them in. \n\nI think League would be a much better game if URF, All for One, Hexa-kill, Ascension and DOOMBOTS were all permanent gamemodes. \n\nPart 2 Why are lore based games not held more often?\nI've played Leaughe for what is coming up on a  Year now and i've only seen one gamemode that resembles a lore gamemode and that is Ascension. \n\nI heard about the Noxus vs Ionia game which sounds like it would be very fun to have normally. I recall many posts about a community of people who hold these fan-lore based games. If there is an entire subcomminunty about it why hasn't Riot put more emphasis on these lore based gamemodes?\n\nJust questions to help me get a better understanding of LoL. \nThanks to those that respond positively.","replies":[]}
