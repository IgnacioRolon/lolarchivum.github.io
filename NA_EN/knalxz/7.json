She's also melee, her spam spell is short range, drains mana, and has been nerfed hilariously (Lag Spikes?), she's squishy as hell and also her damage sucks.

What you suggested actually seems amazing.\n\nPeople are worried about certain assassins survivability as well as some assassins who have none. Eve is one of the few. I agree with everything that you said except for viability for Eve.\n\nEve is only viable in the following two circumstances: \n\n1. She jungles 70% of the time because all of the lanes are being pushed properly. \n\n2. She faces stupid players who don't know about Eve's passive and snowballs from there. \n\nI believe 1 is self-explanatory since Eve is a late game champion, whether it is tank or hybrid or whatever build. She didn't use to be but she is now.\n\nFor 2, it is synonymous to Eve getting fed since the dumb opponent players can be ganked through stealth passive. Higher Elo players care enough to purchase a Vision Ward instead of Stealth. \n\nBoth of these lead to one conclusion in my opinion, which is that Eve is complete shit early game. With the suggestions you have put forth, I believe the shield on W and slow on E can help her regain her stealth assassin ganking abilities that she once had. \n\nWhile some may complain it may not help her jungle clear, Eve doesn't need buffs for jungle clear because skilled Eve players (I consider myself somewhat decent when playing Eve) know how to clear jungle without a leash even. It's just kiting, albeit mana heavy, but possible. If it were too easy then Eve would be considered an OP Champion and people would ask for nerfs. There has to be *some* level of difficulty when playing a champion, and many people overlook that. Evelynn requires a high skillcap, albeit not as much as skilled Lee Sin, LeBlanc, or Zed players. \n\nAll in all, I really like your suggestions and I hope Riot would do something similar to what you have suggested in the near future. But, I must say, she is currently not viable. (in the sense that it is *immensely* tough for her to win games if her team's lanes are being pushed. Compare that to Lee Sin, who has the potential to turn it around.)\n\nBTW, I love {{champion:28}}!","replies":[{"poster":"Spreek","date":"2015-01-12T22:31:48.494+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Eve isn't really a late game champion lol.

But fast forward to a point where mid lane is level ~8 and top and bot ~7...if Eve has not ganked or ganked unsuccessfully, she will fall behind. \n\nEve's jungle clear is so weak, that she relies on kiting the jungle camps. Yes that improves her survivability but her clear time is significantly reduced. Not to mention that if you fail to kite properly, the camps go back and heal (mainly red and blue buff camps). \n\nAs a result, if the Eve player cannot gank properly and use her stealth passive effectively, the player must decide between attempting to gank with a high chance of failure, or simply AFK farm to at least catch up to the level, let alone the gold to buy items.\n\nOnce one of the above to decisions have been made, suppose the game is equal, intense and runs for 40+ minutes, a tank Eve with Triforce and another AD item like BORK or the like can be effective in team fights using her ultimate properly and optimizing the shield from the ult. \n\nBut, this scenario only arises in the current jungle where her jungle clears are slow.\n\nConsequently, I agree with your argument, but I personally feel like it applies to previous jungle map, in which, her clear time was on par with other junglers.
