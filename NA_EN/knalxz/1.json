It was admitted that it was an accident that was just a friendly joke coming out on MLK day or Robert E Lee day for those spooky ghost. \r\n\r\nHere's a page from surrender at 20 saying not to get to attached to the change because of what I said above.\r\nhttp://www.surrenderat20.net/2015/01/red-post-collection-continued-meddler-q.html\r\n\r\nAdmittedly when I first saw the update that Alistar's W was a skillshot I was...spectacle, but after playing it i was left speechless of how fun it was. I can't really put it into words on how much fun I've been having with this \"change\" and i'd really like for it to stay in the game. Either with Alistar or coming back with a future champion release/rework. If not for Ali, how about Poopy, then give her and Sion NFL skins. Eh, you could squeeze Azir into that skins list too, for obvious reasons. \r\n\r\nMoving on I can say I like the new level of mobility that comes with The Cow now and his ability to outplay enemies. I even lost spamming his taunt right before I do it.\r\n\r\n{{champion:12}}  \"Mess with the bull and you get THE HORN!\"\r\n\r\n It also is moderately hard to land, mainly because of the lack of an indicator but it still has a small gap that would be welcomed to Ali. \r\n\r\nSpeaking of skill with Alistar, if you thought this would destroy his combat, its arguably better. You know when you'll get to your target than a quick jerk to the enemy allowing you to even do the combo early for most safety. You know, because sometimes you do something and instantly regret it.\r\n\r\nNow the obvious problem is the unforeseen consequences of this chance. Ali jungle will return with loads more CC, Kaslita Ali combo turns into a horror film from Ed,Edd n' Eddy and well unforeseen consequences means things that we didn't see coming.\r\n\r\nIf Riot removes it on that note I understand, but that doesn't mean I like it :(\r\n\r\nBTW did i mention how much I love the way VU Alistar looks?\r\n\r\nhttp://www.newsoflegends.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Alistar_Splash_01.jpg\r\n\r\nIt really brings out the Minotaur feel.","replies":[{"poster":"DarkChosenOne","date":"2015-01-21T19:30:33.032+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"looks like riot got a lot of problems they got to fix about Alistar......\n\nCheck link - http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/mL0Anypq-free-unchained-alistar-skin-is-not-working-plz-help","replies":[{"poster":"junglerboy16","date":"2015-01-21T23:26:29.872+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The unchained Alistar skin unlock has NEVER worked.
