Throwing the ball to a teammate in the goal gives you 2 points.\nKilling: Encouraged\nScore to: undecided\n\nIf you die, the killer gets the ball.\n\nThe Game adds in two new summoners. \n\nBB Throw High and BB Fast Ball\n\nBBTH throws the ball high allowing it to pass over walls for a short distance. Teammates and enemies will automatically pick up the ball.\n\nBBFB Throws the ball at a range of 3000 units after a brief channel. If it makes contact with players they will automatically pick it up with a brief knockback. If it makes contact with terrain it will stop instantly were it hit. \n\nSpice of Life:\nSpeed shrines have a chance to reduce your speed.\nTHE BUSHES ARE FIRE!: Staying in a bush for too long will send it a blaze for 15 seconds.\nBaron Goo: Holding on to the ball for too long will give you sticky fingers.\nAnomaly: I have no clue what it is, maybe you guys do or Riot. \n\nIf the Baron Ball hasn't made player contact when removed from the central post from 10 seconds, it will reset.\n\n\nRewards\nTraditional icons winning a couple of time medals 1, 2 and 3.\nMVP: Team Icon\nPlaying a game without letting anyone on the enemy team score a goal. Baron Ball Icon\n\nIf Riot were to be generous enough, I want to do something special for the Boss Icons.\n\nIf you have the Icon for that Boss when you get their buff your champion will get a team shirt placed on their champion. Sort of hovering just outside of their hitbox around them. \n\nMaybe even release skins for different teams?\nSyndra with a Dragon's Ballers skin, Sion with a Vilemaw's Trotters skin and releasing another Dunk Master skin. Probably for Vi?\n\n\nWelp, that's Baron Ball. I hope Riot takes it up and we all to be playing it soon.","replies":[{"poster":"InbredFeeder","date":"2015-01-26T21:31:01.079+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Better game made, bronze baron fight.\n\n\nYou get 2 teams of 5 on bronze, start them at lvl 15, with 10000 gold, and make killing the baron an objective.
