How do you present these things for you or someone else to digest and how do you archive it so that certain issues are accessible? \r\nThere's a character that has less counterplay than I'd like and has few meaningful fallback strategies when doing poorly. How do you communicate those issues to other designers on the project in reference form (i.e. documentation) so the problem is always clear?\r\n\r\nWhile I'm at it, do you feel that every champ needs a fallback strategy. Why or why not? I've read that you consider Yasuo a well designed champ in terms of the \"levers\" that can be pulled to keep him in line while also having a strong defensive tool (his Wind Wall) to keep him relevant in teamfights when he's doing poorly. Does every champ need this or should certain champs stay behind if they don't secure an early lead?\r\n\r\nFinally, what are ways in which you attempt to create counterplay where there's very little?","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2014-11-14T22:28:31.319+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":1,"body":"Internally we work with a combination of documented strengths/weaknesses, both in terms of intention and observed, that are kept in a shared file on a per champion basis, and a bunch of discussion/consensus building. Generally we're focused on the conceptual level (e.g. Braum should be strong against ranged threats and work well with auto attacking allies, weaker against divers etc). That's all very much a perpetual work in progress, not a rigid locked down set of laws  though of course. As new information comes in, from player discovery, changes to game systems/meta etc it's often necessary to revisit existing assumptions and then sometimes adjust the approach you'd been taking.\n\nFall back patterns are something we generally want to offer to champions. Being behind should put you at a significant disadvantage, but shouldn't effectively remove you from the game. There are some champions where that's not really the case and that's something that's occasionally worth tolerating if it lets you do enough other valuable things with the character (game design's a series of trade offs basically).\n\nAdding counterplay's all about giving other players ways to interact with a skill, champion or whatever. Some of the most common approaches we'll look at include range limits or changing abilities to skillshots (positional counterplay), requiring buildup or expenditure to use abilities (resource costs, whether mana, buff building, ammo etc), substantial CDs (windows of strength and vulnerability), dependency on other elements like extra enemies/other allied champs etc.","replies":[{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2014-11-14T23:00:46.929+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":">Fall back patterns are something we generally want to offer to champions.

For ADCs that often comes via poke to harass/still farm somewhat (e.g. Ezreal, Kog, Corki, Jinx, Lucian) and/or spell based contributions that aren't too dependent on game performance (e.g. Ashe and Varus especially, Jinx, MF to lesser degrees). Some ADCs do have much weaker fallback patterns certainly and that's one of the risks you take when picking them (Vayne and Draven for example). \n\nCounterpicks can invalidate a champion's primary playstyle and, especially if they don't have a fallback pattern to shift to, potentially shut them down really hard. Late game that's not such an issue, since LoL's a team game where your allies can cover for your weaknesses and there are other enemies to focus instead, early game (laning) however that can be pretty game deciding, hence our desire to avoid hard counterpicks in the early game.

However since you asked an example as someone who wants to play Poppy, I know I can't take her top in a lot of matchups just because she loses hard to most ranged tops as well as other popular melee tops (irelia, darius, maybe renekton).  This is why she's becoming more of a jungler of late... she's so easy to counterpick up top it isn't funny as well as being a great duelist in the jungle.\n\nDepending on who use ask, she might have 6-8 hard counterpicks up top for the early game.  Now yes she makes up for it with the late game, but by then it might be over.  \n\nDon't get me wrong, her late game potential is part of the reason a lot of people love her and in her upcoming rework she needs to keep that endgame terror status, but her early game is the worst in a lot of situations.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2014-11-14T23:12:37.287+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":5,"body":">Fall back patterns are something we generally want to offer to champions.

If you have to back with less than the threshold amount for your next powerspike, it either means that your opponent played really well in forcing you back (and hence should be rewarded) or you made mistakes (and hence should be punished).
