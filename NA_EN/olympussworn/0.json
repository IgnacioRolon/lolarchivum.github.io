The most recent patch broke it almost completely and it's obvious that Riot needs to upgrade/replace their launcher with a more clean and fluid-like program that works really well.\n\nAlso, it's not completely broken, it's just taking A LONG TIME to load. Mine finally loaded up after like 10 minutes or so.\n\nMost PC games nowadays have launchers that are far more superior to this and work with barely any issues. I'm not saying the League launcher is riddled with bugs, but there are noticeable ones that do cause almost significant issues, like the Champion select/ban functionality which sometimes doesn't let you pick anything for a random amount of time. I understand that money and time are a factor for Riot, but they need to focus their attentions on bug fixes and upgrading the game, and its launcher, or they're gonna fall FAR behind the game developers they're competing against in the gaming industry.\n","replies":[{"poster":"Spôôked","date":"2019-11-06T23:15:23.955+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"but league client _is_ littered with bugs...","replies":[{"poster":"Glorious Teemo","date":"2019-11-07T00:07:35.713+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"not just the client.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"PalPlays","date":"2019-11-06T23:09:02.959+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Funnily enough, the League Launcher is still superior to the Epic Games Launcher.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"xelaker","date":"2019-11-06T22:17:33.989+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"They finally gave total control to the balance team, whom promptly went about breaking everything due to incompetence.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BrokenRayquaza","date":"2019-11-06T21:57:17.692+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah lol I'm having this too, I'm heading on Minecraft, anyone else?","replies":[]},{"poster":"I say Facts","date":"2019-11-07T02:59:38.904+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Possibly It was because of Senna.\nHer Ult reached Riot and hurt their system.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Frànkìe","date":"2019-11-07T01:58:58.330+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"client wont load","replies":[]},{"poster":"Glorious Teemo","date":"2019-11-06T22:40:57.142+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yep, i think riot specifically targets ex bathesda employees.

If anything I just noticed another two, but that's about it from what i can see when i'm checking out some of the related posts. If it's spam, then its gotta stop if the developers already know about it,  which they probably do since this is a significant issue. But if they don't, I can't say it's wrong to get the developer's attention.","replies":[{"poster":"ClaireRedfield","date":"2019-11-06T23:07:32.186+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I saw about 3 more after replying to you.
