It's been a while since anyone from the Riot Direct Network Team reached out via the NA forums and I was inspired by my EU colleague who made a post over there, so I figured let's get one going here.  There hasn't been a lot of change since 3 years ago when Riot moved the NA servers to Chicago which is another reason it's been a bit quiet from us, but figured you guys may have some questions anyway.\n\nThings I CAN answer:\n\nNetwork related questions\nWhat we do at Riot Direct\nSinged questions!\nEtc.\n\nTo set expectations, what I CAN'T answer:\n\nGame related questions (bugs/balance/etc/etc) - I'm not a game dev, so don't bother asking me to remove Teemo (I've already been working on this for years and they ignore me :P)\nPlayer Behavior questions (unban me/why did I get chat restricted/etc) - I'm not on the PB team so I can't help there either\nBasically anything not Network related :D\n\nSo fire away!\n\nEDIT: Shout out to our Lag Report tool btw.  It got a lot of visibility back when it was released but wanna make sure people still know about it.  https://lagreport.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/","replies":[]}
