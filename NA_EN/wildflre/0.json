However, in their next response they told me that by me responding, my issue was bumped and that it was sent to the back of the queue again. Is there a way to respond to a Riot Support member email  without bumping the ticket to the back of the queue?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-07-12T21:22:40.997+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When a ticket is being escalated, you should receive a message stating so. This message also mentions that replies or \"bumping\" your ticket before it reaches the new agent will cause it to be sent to the back of the queue. I looked at your ticket and it seems you've been escalated and already received a reply, so you should be good to go from here out!\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[{"poster":"Wildflre","date":"2016-07-14T01:49:42.769+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So, just so I understand this better, if a Riot employee asks for additional tests to be run for a problem I'm experiencing, the way to respond is by replying through email, however this sends me to the back of the queue? Is there a way to respond that doesn't get me a new agent or send me to the back of the queue?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-07-14T16:23:58.265+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The bit about \"bumping\" a ticket in the escalation message just serves as a reminder that while the ticket is being escalated, additional replies while you wait for the new agent to get to your ticket, will cause it to be sent to the back of the queue. It's just a heads-up on how our agents get back to you. In your case, you've already been escalated, so you don't need to worry about being sent to the back of the queue. You can reply normally after working through the steps they give you.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
