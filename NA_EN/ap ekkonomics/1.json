It takes about 5 minutes for me to log in and my ping is about 240-280 in game. Before I downloaded teh PBE my ping was about 150-180 which was definately playable. However this hightened ping has made the game unplayable for me atm. I decided to delete the PBE client hoping that it would reduce the ping and the client lag, but that did nothing. The ping still stayed and my client is still suuuuuuper laggy. I have restarted my computer multiple times and this does not work. I may have to ultimately reinstall the main client, but PLEASE find a fix for this because this is EXTREMELY frustrating.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-23T00:20:49.592+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If your ping is spiking it likely has something to do with your network settings or how your ISP is routing your connection to our servers. Check out the [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) for some basic troubleshooting steps to covers the basics, but do make sure you do the steps on Port Forwarding and DNS settings. Those can tell your network how to send your connection in a smoother way, and be sure to test those changes in a custom game first.","replies":[]}]}
