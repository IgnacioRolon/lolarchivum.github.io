I had no warnings previous to this. my friend was pissing me off so I banned him from the discord,  keep in mind he has a hacking squad, and he and his squad got my account, went into ranked game, that I started but was logged off when there was 2 seconds of q left, and they fed and said some pretty bad stuff. I wouldn&#039;t recommend pissing people off but I was being spammed by 5 people in the server to ban him so that&#039;s what I did and they got my favorite game back. I have spent a good amount of time and money in  this game. I can sometimes be toxic but very rarely will I swear at you unless I&#039;m joking. Riot Plz unban me. It will be great if you all can support me \r\n\r\nign: DrComboWombo","replies":[{"poster":"This Is Your Dad","date":"2017-06-07T21:35:15.268+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"> my friend was pissing me off so I banned him from the discord, keep in mind he has a hacking squad, \n\nWhat the hell kind of friends do you keep?","replies":[{"poster":"Icy Hot Shoto","date":"2017-06-08T01:18:43.150+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Anti Teemo,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=kM0sXk0k,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2017-06-07T21:35:15.268+0000)\n>\n> What the hell kind of friends do you keep?\n\nObviously not the good kind.","replies":[{"poster":"DrComboWombo","date":"2017-06-08T20:57:05.547+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its not my friend and I told my irl friend not to invite him but he did and he blackmailed me","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"AeroWaffle","date":"2017-06-07T21:31:27.747+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can contact support and make the argument that someone else gained access to your account against your permission and your best efforts.
