Same thing as OP described, I load into the champ select screen after hitting accept and I can still hear all of the sounds but I cannot click anything and the screen is entirely black.  I can click on the buttons to close the client etc. but I cannot interact with champ select at all.

No? Oh so I get to enjoy this timer of waiting because of a problem that's not my fault and I get the punishment for it?! On top of this wonderful Leaverbuster timer!
