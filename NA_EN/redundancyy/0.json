Not too much gold obviously.\r\n\r\nSo the idea was that it could be a pirate champ or some kind of aristocrat with a hard to hit skill shot that deals damage and transfers some gold from the hit player to himself. This would probably be a balance nightmare but I think it would be cool.","replies":[{"poster":"Malzahard Mode","date":"2015-03-19T02:02:00.027+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The only way i see a goldstealing ability being \"balanced\" is if it were on a ranged champion and it was a melee range ability, so if they want to steal your gold, they have to get in melee range to do it.  It would also need to be a fixed amount of gold.  The other option is make it so it gives them a debuff where \"for the next X seconds, any gold earned goes to \"the gold stealing champion\" instead","replies":[]},{"poster":"Squeekems","date":"2015-03-19T01:56:24.120+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Goldsteal is not okay.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-03-19T01:22:49.784+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Another ability that generates bonus gold (like GP's Parrrley) could be cool.  Directly stealing gold from an enemy champion adds a lot of anti-fun to the game, however.  Imagine being 50g from BF sword and you're ready to go back to base and then you get robbed by a wayward skillshot underneath your tower.  That's a pretty lame experience, even if it is technically \"balanced.\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"WukongMain","date":"2015-03-18T23:30:18.673+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"think of the lcs tho...where they always hit their skillshots lol\n#FreeGold","replies":[{"poster":"Redundancyy","date":"2015-03-19T01:15:45.694+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mm, good point, maybe have the gold stealing not effect the same champion for like 3 minutes or something like that....","replies":[]}]}]}
