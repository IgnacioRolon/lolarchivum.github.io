Hell, i even bought one of those LoL RP redeem cards to make a purchase and it got rejected as well >:(. I called my bank providers to make sure that my cards were not blocked and they are absolutely not blocked. I AM SO ANNOYED RIGHT NOW xD\r\n\r\n- All i want to do is buy RP to get the star guardian content before it expires and move my account to NA to play with better ping. (I recently moved to the states)\r\n\r\n- I submitted my first ticket about a week ago and i do not have a response from riot support \"yet\". HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE seriously.\r\n\r\n**Ticket ID #1:** 31828845\r\n\r\n**Ticket ID #2:** 31859117\r\n\r\n[](https://imgur.com/B0A5FNZ)","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-21T20:22:05.407+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Putting in a ticket was a solid step, our billing team should be able to help with this.
