Its vaugly explained in its tool tip but the way it works  is it will reset if anything dies in there. \"If an enemy champion dies in the X, the last assisting ally is granted full  kill gold, and Pyke gains the ability to recast within 20 seconds at no cost.\"  Note that it does not say it has to be what kills a champion, just that they have to die.  Pyke gets considered as the last assisting champion when it trys to determine who gets the Cut gold. Its been an interaction on him from day 1.  I don't know if they fixed it yet but it does not Track the gold as Gold Given back when he was released. So if you went 0-0-4 (using the R). You would see it as 0 gold from the ability despite it providing him 4 stacks of your cut.\n\nHope that helps.","replies":[{"poster":"Kenneky","date":"2018-12-09T22:45:18.766+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for the explanation, this has happened several times, I just find It odd.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Bobloser3555","date":"2018-12-09T21:59:48.715+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well it says 0 gold...","replies":[{"poster":"Kenneky","date":"2018-12-09T22:05:06.371+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When I pressed It I got gold.

F12, the default screenshot button, saves a file in the screenshot folder (with the default install path, it's C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Screenshots) instead of using the clipboard. OP may have been checking the clipboard instead of this folder.","replies":[{"poster":"Pokemonred200","date":"2018-12-09T23:28:22.764+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You actually _do_ get a proper screenshot if you play the game in Windowed or Borderless mode (I play in Borderless because I haven't been able to get OBS to properly record my gameplay otherwise).
