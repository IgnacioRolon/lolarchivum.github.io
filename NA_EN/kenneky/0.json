I don't celebrate It myself, but that's not a bad thing (since I don't have a boyfriend yet I guess...). I make this joke Valentine card for my friend even tho we don't love each other that close, we are just good friends and I though I might share It here as well. We both like the same champions (Jhin, Pyke, Lulu pretty much any ADC or Support, but our favs are Jhin and Pyke)... Anyways no need for more talk - Happy Valentine's Day (again)!\r\n\r\nhttp://prikachi.com/images/31/9505031x.png","replies":[]}
