Honestly, I'd suggest going into practice mode for a bit until you get the hang of her, or searching for tutorials and watching others play her on Twitch could be a good resource as well!","replies":[{"poster":"Zerenza","date":"2017-06-17T16:37:03.743+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Twitch is an amazing Recourse, so is Youtube, plenty of riven mains exist on both, the Rivenmain reddit is a great place as well. I did what Broporo suggested last night and practiced Double Casting for a good 20 minutes, i'm a quick learner so i can do it whenever i want now but i'll need to practice a lot more to get her many many other combo's down. \n\nDouble Casting: Cast your E, right before the dash ends cast Q+W at the exact same time, doing so will cast them both at the same time.\n\nUse: Double Casting allows you to stun and automatically proc Thunderlords on someone then get out with your last 2 Q's, or catch someone trying to runaway. It's especially effective for lane's you can't actually win easily, such as fiora, cause it gives you an easy way to deal 200 damage, get out, and win the trade. \n\nFast Combo: Q+AA+Movement Command+Q+AA+Movement Command+Q+AA+Movement Command. This combo is one of the hardest, i don't know how to do it yet consistently. \n\nUse: Shortens the time it takes you to deal a full skill rotation, not absolutely necessary since you'll rarely use this except in 1v1's without minions and while playing Jungle Riven. \n\nR Animation Cancel: use your R then E immediately after, easiest combo to do, takes little to no practice. \n\nMy Favorite Combo: R+E+Double Cast+Q+AA+Q+AA+R\n\nThese combo's more specifically Double Casting and R cancel help a lot with a lot of match up's and are two of the most needed ones when playing Riven because of how generally useful they are.  There are tutorial's on how to do them on youtube if you still can't quite get it.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-17T20:18:18.875+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oooooo I love seeing our players come together to help each other out!!
