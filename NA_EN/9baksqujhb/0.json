But since he jumped on the scene, I&#039;m sure many of you have noticed the increased responses of various rioters (Scruffy, Baconhawk, and KateyKhaos immediately come to mind), the activity of the Boards Dev team, and all the other things that Reds are trying to do to show some love and attention to the folks who - I think it's fair to say - are the most passionate bunch of their player base.
