I play Braum a lot and really love the skin, but was curious why he didn&#039;t have a special laugh. I know he isn&#039;t a special skin or really expensive, but I feel like he is special enough to justify something like a laugh change. Maybe like a simple &quot;Ho ho ho&quot; or something Santa related?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Zimberfly","date":"2018-04-05T23:28:11.833+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Tabel!\n\nThat is truly a fantastic idea for a Santa skin, and seems like a match made in heaven for Braum. Unfortunately, for this skin, doing any new voice-over work was out of scope for the project. When it comes to recording new VO, it actually gets pretty complicated, and though as a sound designer I'd love to throw in a hearty \"Ho, ho, ho\" we have a different Braum voice in every single language, which would mean we would have to reach out to upwards of 20 Braums for each individual \"Ho, ho, ho\" or it would be one voice that is mismatched with all the other Braums. Haha, as you can expect, it gets a bit messy. However, maybe one day we'll give Braum his own legendary and we'll be able to get tons more of those irresistible chuckles we know and love from him.","replies":[]}]}
