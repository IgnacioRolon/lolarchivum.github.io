I recommend running another traceroute using [**WinMTR.**](http://winmtr.net/) After loading up the app, toss **104.160.131.1** into the host field and run a trace for 5 minutes. After 5 minutes has gone by, export your results as text and paste them in a reply.\n\nIf you run into any issues with this, please let me know.","replies":[]}]}
