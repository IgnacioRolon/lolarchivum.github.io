First things first, I'd suggest reaching out to them with that data to show proof that there's a problem somewhere. \n\nIf our servers were having issues, these boards and our tech tickets would be flooded with loads more reports, but overall we haven't seen many connection issues today, other than the small snafu with Charter Spectrum earlier.","replies":[{"poster":"BenneCloff","date":"2017-10-06T02:01:00.445+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi,\n\nI wasn't really expecting an answer for my post. Since it was just a simple case of frustration.\n\nSo what I can deduce from your reply is that even my ISP has joined no - corporation revolution against Riot Games ? I tested around 50 websites was hoping atleast one would have the same problem as Riot Games Server, even my ISP is not willing to believe that everything in the world is working fine just Riot Games servers are going haywire.\n\nThey have this test where they randomly ping around 1000 websites including game servers of different companies around the world, all working perfectly fine, just that this server is having this issue.
