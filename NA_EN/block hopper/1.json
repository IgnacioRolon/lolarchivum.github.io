If you actually care about her do NOT keep the hand on the end of the tentacle. It just looks god awful. Just use the kinda tentacle you have on BC Vel&#039;koz or something of the like. Not a damn robotic arm.\n\nEDIT: allow me to clarify, I voted for Deep Space but Battlecast was my second choice, Just the hand did it in for me. I couldnt bring myself to vote for it because of it. If they make the hand look super badass or give it some unique animation, then maybe. But until we know for sure i just want a regular robotic tentacle.","replies":[{"poster":"Silvarspark","date":"2017-11-20T22:02:59.397+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":0,"body":"Quick reminder: It's not even necessarily a battlecast skin.

Tell me, what would be the motivation to rig such an event then?\nIn the end, this would end in them creating a skin the community doesn't want in majority, which means less sold skins.\n\nThere is absolutely no motive here. Why do people always assume that an event is rigged just because their favourite didn't win?","replies":[{"poster":"RainbowIcee","date":"2017-11-21T14:51:09.055+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"It's not about my favorite didn't win, the visual support of that choices is missing. Plus you make a lot more money by reducing costs and promoting efficiency and battle cast has far too many assets. It's not hard to think battle cast would be the cheapest one to invest time and concept on to create. I get the \"Trying to sell the most skins\" idea but that's for things like Jinx and draven getting a christmas skin even though 2 adc's just got a skin. And why? because ADC's are the bread and butter meta right now they're even buffing shields and heals again. This is what they count on selling, Illaoi is a guinea pig to \"please\" the community skin but it's probably on a budget. But yea it's all a theory, but forgive me for having lack of trust in them lately and seeing how the genetic choice that is always choose to make is the one they're making again. Why do you think they clone themes so much? is a hell of a lot cheaper than proceeding with something new.","replies":[{"poster":"Toxic Memes","date":"2017-11-21T16:19:29.693+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"The boards and Reddit are a very small, yet very vocal minority.
