So I don't really think it's packet loss. I googled input lag and watched examples of it, and this problem looks identical to it. I'm willing to try anything though, so if you have any suggestions please tell me.\n\nEdit: maybe it is packet loss? But I don't understand it... Is it my ISP?\n\nheres a speedtest: https://i.imgur.com/FWCHGuO.png","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-20T22:50:45.174+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Like Victorious Nasus mentioned, this is almost definitely packet loss. Essentially that means that your connection is getting corrupted or losing bits of data before it reaches our servers which is why your champion takes a moment to respond sometimes or why it looks like they're moonwalking/teleporting sometimes.\n\nIt's easy enough to test for by using something like [WinMTR](http://winmtr.net/winmtr-v0-92-now-available/) to run a traceroute to your server, in your case NA which is 104.160.131.1. Run that trace for me and post the results here so I can take a look and let you know where you should go next.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Consent","date":"2017-11-20T18:06:41.041+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"woke up and tested this morning, issue is still here.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sadistic Evelynn","date":"2017-11-20T15:21:15.990+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"THESE IS RED BOTTOMS THESE IS BLOODY SHOES\nsorry {{sticker:sg-lulu}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Moyomi","date":"2017-11-20T12:25:27.868+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have this same exact problem and tried all the fixes you listed too, so you're not alone.
