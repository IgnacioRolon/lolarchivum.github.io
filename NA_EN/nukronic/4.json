My wife and I are already on the fence about some of our other games that have voice chat and how we feel about it. The biggest difference with those games is you join a sub-community you like. You like a particular server with particular people and your play with them. They become friends if you like them, and you move on to a different server if you don't. League's not built that way. You have no control over who you get paired up with. Add to this that people who normally vent frustrations in ways that are OK by League standards, such as telling at their screen instead of typing it out, are now a problem for the community.\n\nAnd before you jump to say \"just mute them\" or \"don't use it then\", you know as well as I do from playing with premades that communication drops off sharply when some players are on voice chat but not all. People don't tell you what they're doing in champion select, they don't ping, and they only type at you to tell you just how much you screwed up their plan that you didn't know about.\n\n\n\n> What he's really saying is \"we don't want to spend the money for more bandwidth\"\n\nDoes Curse Voice use a central server, or is it all per-to-per? Because last I heard Riot was looking at Curse Voice.","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2015-07-18T19:51:06.124+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ya, they invested 30 million into Curse recently.
