I only played Dominion; it's what got me into and kept me with the game.\nPre-Season 4 I finally started playing Summoner's Rift, but I love Dominion to pieces regardless.\nThe removal of Dominion had me feeling very sad.\n\nWith the release of the rotating game queue, I was glad that there was finally an updated Dominion to play. Although I miss the old style, I definitely appreciate the visual overhaul that was done to it.\n\nAlbeit it appears in the RGM queue once every generation, I'm still glad it was there.\n\nBut today, a Rioter accidentally tweeted that Dominion was being brought back.\n\n\"[but] to keep competitive integrity, it's going to be draft only\"\n\nthe tweet was later redacted.\n\nThe screenshot below is a leak of the Rioter-Exclusive Beta Environment, testing the Queue.\n\nhttps://s15.postimg.org/6y5t1hp5n/waittime.png\n","replies":[]}
