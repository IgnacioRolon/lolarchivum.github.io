It really does help us prioritize who we look at and I definitely feel you on the concerns you have about players who are already going through a lot in their life.\n\nGoing forward, definitely report any other players who go out of their way to create a negative experience for others so we can take it from there. Let me know if you have any questions.","replies":[{"poster":"Jupiter354","date":"2016-11-02T04:25:14.486+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just wanted to say I really respect riot for the way they handle these things. I've played for 7 years and have always diligently reported people acting that way, and it's because I know riot cares/acts on the reports.\n\nThank you OP for doing the right thing and thank you Riot for handling the toxic aspects of the community in such a mature and helpful way! Mad props! :)\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}]}]}
