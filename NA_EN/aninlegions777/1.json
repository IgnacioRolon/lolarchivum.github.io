I know that isn't much but damn is it annoying. I enter champ select. Go to loading screen. Black. Reconnect. Black. Logout and Login, patcher starts downloading files. Finishes. Login. Remake. Leaverbuster. CAN YOU TELL ME WHY DAFUQ I'M GETTING UPDATES JUST BEFORE A GAME? WHY ONLY ME? I'm fcking tilted cos it's unfair. I'm getting punished for your trash system. If you want to put out updates, disable ALL SR games 30 mins before. It's that easy. Don't punish me for being to lazy to disable queues. Jeez!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-07T17:28:41.275+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This sounds pretty frustrating!  Based on everything you've reported here, I'm pretty confident that you might be having a connection problem reaching the game server.  The reconnections and black screens due to assets failing to download are usually culprits of a network issue.  I know leaving isn't intentional, but the system treats everyone equally.  You should go over the steps in the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to troubleshoot this instability and get things fixed up.  Good luck!","replies":[{"poster":"AninLegions777","date":"2017-04-08T01:52:07.960+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Then why is the patcher downloading updates? On that day I remember there was an exclamation mark on that server status thingy before I went into champ select. But after restarting, it was gone. I'm guessing the patcher downloaded updates to fix something.","replies":[]}]}]}
