I know I shouldn't play on it. However I was running league just fine before the patch release. My CPU was not getting hot either. It would never make noise until the update. Now my CPU runs hot as hell and the game loads way slower laggs a lot when I alt+tab. I had 60 FPS issue but it got fixed after some update. However this shit is laggy as hell still. It sometimes uses my whole CPU just to run the game. Dota would run smoother than league now. DON'T get it maybe should switch back to dota.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-08T21:57:34.262+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmmm if your Mac is still running pretty hot, there's a chance that you could be having some issues other Mac players were having with Vsync.
