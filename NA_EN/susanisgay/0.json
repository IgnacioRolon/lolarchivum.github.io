I get grouped up on by people all the time.  They play completely like garbage, feed the enemy repeatedly, rail on me in chat, and apparently if I defend myself, I get chat banned?  And then, of course, the system only gives you your side to defend yourself.  How about giving me the whole conversation.  Looking at one person's comments can make anybody look bad.  How about the fact that today, I had my support feed the bot lane himself and, in so doing, me, then bails on me and proceeds to lose in other lanes stealing xp and cs but somehow the loss is my fault.  I couldn't even farm from the thresh hitting cs and trying to engage all of the time.  He destroyed any shot we had and still, because he was friends with others, they all ganged up on me and were toxic as hell but I got punished.  I refused to give up and they were calling for early ff at 10 minutes because THEY were throwing.  Wth is wrong with a system when a player gets punished for the actions of others playing in a group and trolling?  You're giving your game away to the very toxic people your system is supposed to be protecting the rest of us from.","replies":[{"poster":"Aneirin","date":"2018-05-31T21:13:53.360+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":">  Wth is wrong with a system when a player gets punished for the actions of others playing in a group and trolling?\n\nYou get punished because of your own actions. Nothing they do can force you to be toxic. It's easy to mute and play.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Colgate Gator","date":"2018-05-31T20:08:07.277+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Use brain.exe\" is probably my favorite line in the chat log.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SusanIsGay","date":"2018-05-31T23:44:25.600+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks to everyone that took the time to respond to my post. I still think this was unfair, but after reading the comments I understand how it happened. Yes, I did have a previous 14-day ban. I was swearing at teammates, but after that 14-day ban, I told myself I wouldn't swear ingame ever again. So I talked trash without swearing and I didn't think I would get banned so easy and quick when other people swear more than me. But I understand that it's not the fault of the messages, but more the fault of negativity and getting reported right after my 14-day ban. I'm going to create another account and just do /mute all as soon as I get in-game because I know as soon as I have a bad teammate and they open up their chat I'm gonna wanna flame. I don't actually consider myself a negative player, I just hate it when people do horrible/troll and then blame on teammates. I think there should be a better system to ban people who do that. Anyways, thanks to everyone who commented on this post it was really cool seeing your feedback, and it's nice to know I'm, not the only one experiencing this.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zombie Gerbil","date":"2018-05-31T19:15:56.228+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"What you said isn't what got you to a permaban, what you said got you to your next penalty.\nYou get 4 penalty strikes. Use each one and you move onto the next penalty. In this case, you were on your last penalty which was your 14-day ban, you continue your toxicity and negativity, which led you to your last penalty.\n\nThe thing is, what the majority of the players to understand is that it's not what they said last got them the permaban, what they consistently did lead you led you to your permaban. The chat log you provided didn't skip 3 penalties straight to a permaban. You've been flagged so many times it led you to a permaban.\n\nZero-Tolerance chat leads you straight to a 14-day ban. \nI believe 3rd Party programs, boosting, or account buying leads you straight to a permaban.\n\nSo no, your chat didn't give you a straight up permaban. Your consistent negative attitude over a period of games and using up 3 penalties got you to your permaban.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rouxful","date":"2018-05-31T19:00:19.481+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"And something I always feels the need to remind people is that calling for report is a reportable offense","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-05-31T18:53:11.986+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"You flamed.
