As the game becomes increasingly more complex over time and more and more factors simply are getting overbearing to be paranoid about to make up for the disadvantage.\r\n\r\nI have tried turning the sound back on before to see if I could play it by ear (sorry, bad joke) but between a finicky ISP, poor weather conditions affecting the signal, and the concern other factors I am unaware of could be influencing the matter, I simply cannot make a safe assumption on the matter.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, as I'm not overly tech-savvy, if it does so happen to be an ongoing issue, would updating to the new client make a difference or would the core problem simply carry over?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-03T00:46:20.140+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I haven't seen any reports of FPS issues caused by sound on the Mac Client for a while.

I'll experience very inconsisent fps drops to 11 or below and other times my latency shoots up anywhere from the 800 ms to (I wish I were exhaggerating here) 3500 ms.\n\nAgain, not *consistent* but in the first 5-10 minutes after everyone is loaded in is when, if it DOES happen, the fps drop will usually rear its ugly head.\n\nSometimes it's simply being in close proximity to as little as two or three other people on the map while other times it's perfectly a-okay. Spell effects don't really seem to matter that much, as far as I've been able to tell, considering I've been in 5v5 teamfights with cooldowns being spammed by all and it's pretty hit or miss there.\n\nAnd then there are the times where I can hear everything going on, I see both chat going at its normal pace as well as normal gameplay by others with moving around and using abilities, but I cannot move/cast or chat MYSELF. I know the difference between this and normal lagging as the normal lagging would \"fast-forward\", if you will, at some point and finally catch up to real-time. On the former, though, it IS real-time and I'm disabled.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-03T21:59:43.058+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah, so you're seeing a few different issues here, since FPS and your other issues in game are not directly related. Let's focus on your ability/moving issue for now and we'll pick up on the FPS after we've solved the others. Though the symptoms are different, the delay/fast-forward issues and the locked out of taking actions are both commonly caused by *Packet Loss* issues. I'd strongly recommend working through our [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to ensure your local network settings are setup properly for League.\n\nLet me know if this caused any change.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
