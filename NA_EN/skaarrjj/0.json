They don't have the damage, so it's easier to duel them. You shouldn't have slower clear times because you can gank well. You should have slower clear times due to how well you are able to duel. Pretty much ALL tank junglers suck at dueling, and that is the reason why it's so easy to invade them. Giving them faster clears will help mitigate it (not eliminate it) and will allow them to actually maintain levels isntead of falling behind.","replies":[{"poster":"Hyrum Graff","date":"2014-05-23T16:41:06.911+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think you mean, they are invaded easily because of how well they duel.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"playtestpenguin","date":"2014-05-23T02:46:11.843+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"its the lack of base stats/passive jungle clear ability\n\nit makes no sense that nautilus has like 11 base armor when broken toplaners like jax have the highest base HP in the game","replies":[{"poster":"Skaarrjj","date":"2014-05-23T15:16:59.312+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot won't nerf anymore toplaners though.
