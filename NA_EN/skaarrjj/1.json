To me it sounds ridiculously forced, like a 15 yr old trying to sound like they have a deep voice. It just comes out sounding nasally and over the top dramatic. If it weren't so nasally it would actually sound scary.\n\nI'm honestly really disappointed in this Sion update. He's so entirely item dependent now, needs ridiculous amounts of armor for survivability, and if you build HP your passive lasts an even shorter amount of time (hp loss is by %) because your life-steal is not enough. He's like a Tryndamere without the benefit of actually being able to survive. Their goal was to supposedly reinforce the ad style of play, but IMO they reinforced his old AP style of playing. He's got a short burst of damage, and can go train-mode into an enemy. His Q takes so long to charge that it's borderline worthless.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Commando Yi","date":"2014-10-09T19:17:14.002+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":8,"body":"you sound like someone who never played the old sion","replies":[{"poster":"Catlamity","date":"2014-10-09T20:12:35.530+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":3,"body":"I loved the old Sion, but the new sion is just so much more comfortable.
