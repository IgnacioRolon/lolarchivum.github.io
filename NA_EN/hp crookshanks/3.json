Ganking and getting a flash was _huge_, now it hardly even feels like an accomplishment because they have so much other mobility.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BLIGHTBRINGER","date":"2018-08-06T19:28:37.077+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Often people will say that the counterplay is not to get in melee range of Lee.
