For my 2 years of playing league there have been frequent times when they just say eh screw it, and make the NA servers lag without care. I know it's not an internet connection issue on my part because i can host 1080p streams and watch them perfectly fine, I also have other players in every single game in the past day and a half, 4 out of the 10 players in the game will get lag with the servers, i even had a game that everybody in the game was playing terribly because of lag. FIX YOUR SERVERS RIOT! I'm tired of having every other week have fking lag issues spread, and i ahvent heard it from any other sides of the world playing. Nope, JUST NA! FIX THEM NOW!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-19T23:53:58.743+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you are able to access other online content just fine but experiencing problems staying connected with league, then you may be having a packet loss issue.
