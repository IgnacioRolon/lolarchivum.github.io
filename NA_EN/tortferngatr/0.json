One answer is 'just make it an evolution system like Kha'Zix/Victor,' but I think that design space is starting to get a bit crowded and it's really important that we preserve what makes those champions feel unique. Stats sort of work, but they create a similar feeling of the game playing keep-away with your power. Somehow the Twin Fang augment works, as it's power in a way which adds some softer decisions and doen't really change Cassiopeia's combat pattern. So, if we're going to swap out the stats for more interesting things that feel exciting to get rather than necessary, it would have to fit along these lines.\n\nHonestly, I think a much better comparison for Cass would be a different evolution system:\n\n{{champion:107}} {{item:3417}} {{item:3167}} {{item:3407}} {{item:3414}} {{item:3454}} : Yo.\n\nRengar's Bonetooth Necklace is a good example of a linear evolution passive that *does* work without feeling boring--and while he technically doesn't NEED it to function, it does successfully give him a linear evolution path that feels fun--and more importantly, meaningful.\n\nLet's look at it:\n\n> UNIQUE Passive - Mementos of the Hunt: Rengar collects trophies when killing Champions and gains bonus effects based on how many trophies he has. Kills and assists grant 1 trophy.\n> \n> 3 Trophies: Rengar gains 25 Movement Speed whilst out of combat or in brush.\n> 6 Trophies: Increases the range of Rengar's Leap by 125. Active upgrades at 6 Trophies. \n> 12 Trophies: Thrill of the Hunt's duration is increased by 5 seconds.\n> 20 Trophies: Thrill of the Hunt's Movement Speed while stealthed is doubled. *(Unlisted: According to LoL Wiki, Rengar gains the upgraded trinket effects at 20 trophies as well.)*\n\nThe Bonetooth necklace page on LoL Wiki mentioned something about the Head of Kha'Zix giving increased vision range to Knifecat in brush as well, but it wasn't on the Rengar page itself. \n\nA few major things stick out:\n\n* Rengar has a separate, highly iconic passive already and doesn't require Bonetooth Necklace to function\n\nThis I think would probably be the first comparison most old Cass players would make; it does not require much explanation. I will say that Viktor has no passive besides the Hex Core and its upgrades, though--I think that what's important is that he's balanced around not needing Necklace. That being said: Thresh is balanced around needing his souls to scale properly, so perhaps there are better reasons than this.\n\n* Rengar's effects grant him effects he can explicitly play around, bonuses that are not easily mimicked by convenient itemization/masteries.\n\nAll of Bonetooth Necklace's bonuses give Rengar a new strategic tool or enhance the strategic potential of his existing tools. The first bonus makes him even more dominant in brush--and the out-of-combat movement speed also makes him consider roaming to find more trophies. The second bonus improves one of his most iconic abilities--his brush leap--by improving its cast range (which, as Stashu mentioned of Syndra in another thread, is normally sacrosanct.) The third bonus lets him ult from a further distance--or more effectively psych out his opponents. The fourth bonus lets him hunt from even further away--and lets him get to his opponents more quickly, giving them less time to react.\n\nRighteous Glory and Boots of Mobility and are the only two things that can vaguely mimic the bonuses Bonetooth Necklace provides--and neither are 1 to 1 fits for those bonuses.\n\n* The Necklace stacks in a visceral manner that Rengar is strongly rewarded for pursuing.\n\nNecklace rewards Rengar for getting kills/assists. Kills and assists are good, but Rengar wants them more than other people do, so he plays in a way meant to get him more kills/assists than other champions. Kills and assists also feel inherently good to obtain.\n\n* The Necklace gives Rengar an \"Aghanim's Scepter\"--making his highest moment [his ultimate] feel even better to use.\n\nRengar's passive makes his high points--such as being strong in brush--feel even better. As such, he isn't compensating for something.\n\n* Some of the Necklace's benefits are strategic advantages (such as stronger roaming potential).\n\nStrategic benefits (like Dragon's new \"global stacking passive\" and the MS boost out of combat on Necklace) provide an effect that changes how you play in the long-term--appropriate for a stacking passive meant primarily to give benefits over a long-term period of time.\n\n* The Necklace--and its enhancements--_all tie into some aspect of Rengar's fantasy/gameplay_.\n\nThis is probably the thing that sticks out the most to me. Rengar is a *trophy hunter*--as Rengar gains more and more trophies, he gets a passive that gives him...well, a trophy collection. As he claims trophies (kills/assists), he gets to feel more and more accomplished.\n\nHis bonuses also *enhance* his gameplay in ways that *make him feel like a hunter* (or a *goddamn lion*, that's also part of his fantasy). Rengar gets more movement speed in brush and while out of combat, letting him reach his quarry faster while tracking them (or fighting inside his hunting grounds, brush.) The range increase takes one of the most iconic parts of Rengar (his passive) and makes it even stronger--anything the tall grass touches is his. His ultimate gets first a duration boost, letting him track his quarry longer and psychologically toy with them, while his final boost makes the rush of hunting your quarry becomes all-consumingly fast.\n\nAll this combines to make Bonetooth Necklace totally work out for Rengar.\n\n**Bonetooth Necklace tl;dr:** Bonetooth necklace works because Rengar doesn't need it to function or be satisfied and it's satisfying both to stack and benefit from stacks. Most importantly, it fits his flavor like a glove.\n \n--------------------\n\n{{champion:69}}: Back to me.\n\nNow, before we get into Cass's passive, I want to discuss her fantasy/thematic identity/flavor for a moment.\n\nThe boards have all been stirring with her \"venom mage\" fantasy/gameplay, which seemed to strongly take a back seat to her \"mage ADC\" gameplay when the Cassiopeia rework was initially launched.\n\nHowever, Cass's theme ultimately encompasses more than that. She also draws on the mythological Medusa, a woman cursed to be a monster with snakes for hair that could petrify those who looked at her (hence Cass's ultimate); she also plays up the \"snake\" aspects considerably. \n\nWhile her venoms might be a key aspect of what made her enjoyable, they were also part of a larger fantasy--the fantasy of a [naga mage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N%C4%81ga) or more likely a *viper/cobra mage*: watching at a distance, harassing with poisons while swaying with deadly cadence, then lashing away at a weakened opponent, striking bite after bite after bite until they succumb to venom and blood loss. Her viper/cobra (and perhaps naga) inspirations are probably why her Twin Fang has been played up so much in her rework--yeah, some cobras spray their venom, but vipers and many other cobras *inject* their venom--and also note that the naga, according to Wikipedia, as described in the Mahabharata as \"ever bent on biting other creatures.\" \n\nAs hinted, Deadly Cadence also might have had ties to her \"cobra mage\" feel in that it strongly encouraged her to cast Q every 4.5 seconds, giving her a sense of rhythm (much as a cobra's sway has rhythm). However, it had a much more cerebral connection to her various fantasies/inspirations than her other abilities--and while I think that the \"rhythm\" aspect of Deadly Cadence should be reincorporated into Cassiopeia somehow (possibly through a second passive), it still felt a bit tacked-on from a flavor perspective and I can see why it was replaced.\n\nFrom that same flavor perspective, Cassiopeia's (much loathed) new passive, Aspect of the Serpent, initially seems even more tacked on. However, as I researched this wall of text, I realized something: Aspect of the Serpent ties another aspect of her \"medusa fantasy,\" the curse, directly into her gameplay--as she learns to embrace her curse, she grows stronger and stronger. *If done well*, it could really give the player that same feeling of embracing a terrible curse--and truly becoming the hyperscaling Medusa monster Stashu originally intended. Thinking about it that way, I can see why Stashu stuck to his guns--that's actually a really cool idea. A \"fully realized\" version of her passive would indeed make sense on Cassiopeia.\n\nThe main problem with it, then, is that the execution was horrible enough to turn Teemos to stone. [I think Stashu has noticed this as well](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/rfB1OUVF-stashu-thought-on-cassiopeia-passive?comment=0000), but I think I have an additional perspective to add here. \n\nAs it stands, _the passive's stacking mechanisms and bonuses don't actually make you viscerally feel like you're embracing the **aspect of the serpent**_. That, I think, is the crux of the issue. While the application method *vaguely* feels appropriate (in a very cerebral manner), that's it. It's weak and doesn't even have interaction with her other Medusa-specific ability.\n\n> Yeah definitely. I've experimented with a number of more 'interesting' mechanics as rewards for the breakpoints. Ultimately, they all, much like the current stat-y one, created a feeling in the player of \"but why do I have to wait?\" Basically, when you get a tool that alters the way you approach your core combat pattern, the kit feels incomplete without it. The healing on E is kind of cool and adds some decisions, but none that really change the way you approach combat, except that now you are kind of just stronger.\n\nI think the issue is that rather than embracing the curse and its power, you're embracing some lifesteal on your autoattack replacement (which does vaguely make sense) and two stat boosts that can be directly replicated by useful itemization. For the more \"interesting\" mechanics--again, the issue is that it shouldn't just make her feel stronger, it should make her feel like she's embracing the curse and being rewarded with the curse's power as a result. It's probably a good idea to use mechanisms that make her more interesting--but unless they make you feel like you're embracing the curse and further enhance her \"high points\", they're still going to fail to provide an answer to the \"why have to wait\" question.\n\nNot only that, but the stacking mechanisms--poisoning people and time--are very, very subtle. Perhaps \"poisoning champions\" could *also* stack a reworked Deadly Cadence (providing some tactical benefit that feels like embracing her curse *in the moment*--then strategically improving her in the long run)? What about making kills/assists provide extra stacks (\"killing people with venom and fangs\" is certainly a serpentine thing to do--and it also lets Cass progress through her power curve faster if she gets ahead [like other champions with hyperscaling power curves--which was one reason why her power curve felt so bad in the first place])? \n\nAt least one effect should provide a strategic bonus. One pair of changes I think might produce a VERY good \"max stacks\" effect (albeit a crappy one for Dominion) that would also fit her \"hypercarry\" power curve: let her Twin Fang target towers without stacks (normally going on full CD while doing so), then let Miasma corrode and damage structures at max stacks of Aspect of the Serpent. Boom--Cassiopeia suddenly becomes a much bigger threat, one that with Sorcery elixir can shred towers in a matter of seconds (albeit far later than when Azir and Ziggs reach that point, and with worse counter-siege potential than either.) The raw impact of the effect more than justifies the wait--*she can now poison and Twin Fang even buildings to dust*. It should be paired with another thematically-appropriate final passive (since tbh it does feel a bit \"metagamey\"--and again, Dominion loses out), but still--it works.\n\nAdditionally, the final bonus (or at least the penultimate bonus), rather than simply giving more %ability power, should enhance her ultimate somehow. It's the *signature* Medusa ability; the Medusa-themed passive should interact with it somehow. It's one of her highest points; like Rengar, an ult enhancement from the stacking passive would be in order.\n\nFinally, I'll say this: If you find a direction for Aspect of the Serpent that works, give Cass voice lines related to her passive. Vayne has a line for learning Silver Bolts and Syndra has multiple lines for hitting max level on each of her basic abilities; Cass has...nada.\n\n**Cass's passive tl;dr:** The \"embrace the curse\" theme of her passive makes total sense for a Medusa-inspired champion; what doesn't make sense is everything else about her current passive; I have some ideas about how to make the passive more interesting. I apologize for having bad formatting after the final quote, but please--actually read this section for details; I've been thinking about this for 8 or 9 hours and writing this for like 5 or 6 of those. ;_;","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Stashu","date":"2014-11-28T15:23:16.462+0000","up_votes":52,"down_votes":11,"body":"First off, thanks for spending so much time with this analysis.

I know we as a community can lash out and be a bit venomous when we get upset, so it helps to  hear that you agree with us and may consider working in a direction we as a community want as a whole. May I suggest a collaborative session with the community to strike up new ideas for fixing the passive? It may bring things out of the rut they're in and potentially turn you guys on to some new ideas that never occurred to you.\n\nWith that being said, I think a major flaw with the way you've handled this has been a lack of explanation on why you felt this passive fit. For the entire time I've been on this forum discussing this new passive, I never once heard you mention in any thread that it was supposed to represent her embracing her curse. That tidbit would have probably helped many people to understand what direction you're going with this and perhaps even help them to embrace your ideas a little easier and get into the same train of thought when discussing where to take it.\n\nOn that note, I feel like if she's embracing the power of the serpent, the emphasis granted by the passive, should it stay, should be straight buffs to her poisons at the various milestones. Here's a few ideas:\n - A stronger poison occurs when hitting an opponent with both Noxious Blast and Miasma\n - Increasing the spread speed or increasing the radius of Miasma.\n - Adding a mild stun or root to miasma should an opponent sit in it for a long duration.\n - Decreasing the delay on Noxious Blast\n - Adding the poison amp to her auto attacks.\n - Adding a slow/attack speed debuff to enemies hit by Petrifying Gaze.\n - Strengthening the MS buffs/MS debuffs on Noxious Blast and Misasma.\nAdditionally, E should be reworked. Drop the bonus effects, as they only tend to emphasize the focus in her kit. If anything, E should have an execute style effect that deals more damage to damaged foes, similar to Elise's Venomous Bite. Also, I don't see why Twin Fangs couldn't have the Deadly Cadence effect attached to it and affect it alone - this would prevent the effects on her poisons and give you an incentive to go all in when the time arises; Both of these effects in tandem feel snake like and emphasize it's use in finishing off enemies rather than as her main form of DPS. If her poisons get some semblance of their power back, with the added bonuses from a modified Aspect, they would be the main focus, leaving E and R to control and kill when foes start to run. \n\nAgain, thank you Stashu for your time and for listening to us. I only hope that you can make the changes we as Cassiopeia players wish to see, as that will make us happier, make our beloved mage beloved again, and save you and your team the time it takes to constantly devote time to this balancing the reworking so that hopefully you can move onto other more pressing projects.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Stashu","date":"2014-11-28T22:55:57.291+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":3,"body":"Thanks for suggesting some mechanics that you would like to see on the passive.

Thanks Toertferngatr for finally breaking through but I had some of the highest up-votes in the previous threads and ... just now we are learning this?  Suddenly feel like some of those ideas weren't read at all?  OK then , done venting so water under the bridge ... but parts of this response is a bit disheartening.  OK moving on for real now...\n\nThe theme of \"embracing the curse\" seems to be gaining steam so I'd like to once again throw my two sense in:  I fundamentally don't agree with the notion that a curse should increase your power ... that's a pretty crappy curse.   \"she who attempts to steal this power shall be cursed .... with a ever growing power of her own\" .... what?\n\nWe need to  be extremely careful with how this passive rewards the player over time.   I'd really prefer the passive to reward in ways that provide a feeling of adapting/acceptance rather than raw power.  So the stacking AP needs to go.  Just be out with it.  Things like MS, or increasing poison power, or removing casting time would feel more like a being growing into her body than someone just getting stronger ... which simply doesn't make sense.\n\nWhile I realize the immediate need to get he numbers right take priority, also take time to look at what she is in end game right now.  Cassi, even with a number buff, is still a single-target damage dealer with no zoning, escaping, or siege mechanics.  Her scope is simply too narrow right now to be truly competitive even if she does reach viable damage.  DOTs provide a soft-zoning power ... forcing enemies back as they don't want to deal with the soft burn.  If the DOTs are out, give her some kind of real zone either through W ... or some kind of siege power ... or something.\n\nMy point is that by end game ... *tons of champions have ridiculous damage*.  It will never be enough on it's own.  Cassi needs a secondary mechanical strength beyond \"DPS\" if she is ever to be a true competitive choice.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hyrum Graff","date":"2014-11-29T05:04:34.334+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Would you consider making a \"Let's Talk about Cassiopeia\" thread where you say what you think she is, from a thematic perspective (ex: a noblewoman who needs to come to terms with her transformation into a medusa-like poison mage), and ask others to do the same, NO GAMEPLAY?

The new passive and the resulting nerfs to her Q & W (her main poke/zoning tools) changed her into a Nasus/Veigar stack addict champion that needs a lot of stacks to realize their full potential & be played the way they were designed to. Cass had a great lane bully feel with her poisons but as a direct counter to that she had limited mobility making her weak to all ins and ganks. The only way she wins all in engagements is to stun and burn the target down before the stun breaks and they do the same to her, which in most cases she had trouble doing until at least mid game. \n\nThe main reason why the Cass rework wasn't what it could be is because it robbed her of her more sinister weaken and kill playstyle for an Ability Power Twin Fang Carry playstyle which feels a lot less rewarding & makes her more susceptible to death by bruiser","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ptarlorr","date":"2014-11-28T23:14:25.319+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The \"toxic\" miasma idea sounds really neat indeed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"exe3","date":"2014-11-28T23:23:55.269+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like that idea.

To me, you only got that Medusa-theme because of her ultimate. Literally nothing about her kit and play-style even plays into that theme at all.\n\nRiot gave her that R in a very Pantheon-esque way. Just like how Pantheon as a whole was tacked onto the game because they saw an opportunity to make a walking 300-reference, Riot gave Cassiopeia her R because they saw an opportunity to reference Medusa just because Cassiopeia had the lower half of a snake.\n\nIt'd certainly be cool if she really was a Medusa-themed champion, but in her current state, the only thing hinting at it is that R of hers which has nothing to do with the rest of her kit.\n\n**\nHowever, nitpicks aside, you hit the mark on many points, so congrats.
