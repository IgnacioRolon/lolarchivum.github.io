If my hunch is right, this is happening because your connection is losing important pieces of information before it reaches our servers which is making some things respond really awkwardly. \n\nLet's test for any packet loss by having this [**log reader**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743) scan the network logs from that game, or the most previous game, if you can. Post a screenshot here of what it says so I can go over it with you!","replies":[{"poster":"AlexReformed1","date":"2017-09-15T09:18:09.347+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://gyazo.com/8afc1e4427a4b0a5027ce0f1e1718710 This is my connection.\nhttps://gyazo.com/fdf444baf794073207bfb0cb09585ef7 This is the logs from one of hte games i played yesterday.One thing to note though is,I don't really have ping issues whatsoever maybe for like a split second or something it would jump to 200-ish but it would go back to normal soon after and it happens very sporadically,and definitely not during the time i experience the packet loss","replies":[]}]}]}
