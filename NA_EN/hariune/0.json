He's even gotten me chat-banned for 10 games and destroyed my Honor level to 0. He hasn't really affected my ranked statistics though, thankfully the hacker has simply played numerous normals and only 2 ranked games (1 remake and 1 victory for a total of +2 lp). My point I'm trying to get at is, even if Riot undoes all of the unauthorized, and completely illegal, purchases, I'm hoping they also undo the chat ban and restore my Honor Level because it was also done under illegal circumstances. To make things worse, this was also during the same time that Riot acknowledged that there were problems with logging in (when I was frantically trying to see what damage the hacker had done to my account) - friendly reminder: CHANGE YOUR PASSWORD AND MAKE SURE IT'S NOT EASILY HACK-ABLE!! {{summoner:31}}","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-04T02:29:56.671+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You'll have to get that all taken care of within your ticket. Once we can see that your account was hacked and this activity happened while it was compromised, we can work to reverse the damage that was done.","replies":[{"poster":"Hariune","date":"2017-10-04T20:26:44.507+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright, thanks Broporo!","replies":[]}]}]}
