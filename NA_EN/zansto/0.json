She basically has the lowest armor, magic resist, and movement speed in game. While her damage is fine almost everything else is not. Her heal/shield, movement speed ability, and ult are all pretty lackluster. While she does not need an extremely strong buff, when compared to other supports she is in desperate need of tweaking, but mainly in base stats. Also pretty much any champion can one shot her, so if you want to play Sona you have to be a god at dodging.","replies":[{"poster":"Shukr4n","date":"2018-04-04T03:56:46.710+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Sona,is,actually the,worst supp in game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Reaper Soraka","date":"2018-04-04T04:13:09.110+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think she just needs a rework.

I Mained her for a while and only really stopped because of shifting tastes in what I enjoyed and a little bit because I felt bad playing a 53% winrate champ (at the time). I’d like so see some buffs like Ult range increase, More movement speed on her rank 1 move speed ability, or minor ratio increases across the board. \n\nShe’s really good, and she comes close to a late game Damage support as she is, so some ratio buffs or team fight utility like ult range could really help that. Lanning Sonna was really OP but maybe a late game oriented one will do better\n\nShe’s probably also not the weakest support in the game, just down there with some of them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-04-04T04:11:38.620+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh shit, Sona is no longer 55% winrate freelo cheese, get the torches!","replies":[]},{"poster":"hi ìm groot","date":"2018-04-04T06:48:18.076+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The... fuck.
