I don't get why when you receive one penality, you get so easily banned . People are overly toxic everyday, none of them get banned, as soon i say something '' considered, offensive'' by those 10 years old kids, i receive ban. Riot mentality of banning is getting worst and worst everyday. Good Bye Riot, piece of crap compagny who get our money and still accept permanent ban when in every other games ban isn't even an option.","replies":[{"poster":"AeroWaffle","date":"2016-06-14T03:59:46.527+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm not sure what world you're living in, but plenty of games ban when you consistently break the rules.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zombiemaster","date":"2016-06-14T04:16:36.385+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"> there is people who flame, verbal abuse, troll, feed on purpose, and never ever get punished\n\nUmm... there's plenty of posts on this very forum that suggest the exact opposite.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Narvuntien","date":"2016-06-14T04:07:56.153+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":4,"body":"I am sooooo sick of this stupid notion of \"its their fault for being offended\".

Permabans are designed to get rid of people who would rather troll and be jerks to others rather than follow the rules and interact with others in a neutral or positive manner. Many businesses do this, it's nothing new. If you refuse to follow their rules then you get removed from their business because of your own poor behavior. It's not rocket science here: follow the rules and don't act like a jerk to others when things don't go your way and you won't get punished, it's as simple as that.\n\nNow if you want to actually discuss your ban rather than just rant and rave like a madman then please post your reform card here (the entire reform card, not just bits and pieces of it). Otherwise there's nothing we can do here to help you out.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AÃ­r","date":"2016-06-14T08:05:26.934+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Well, looks like Riot did something right here...\n\nNice to see that the system works as intended. xD","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vladimeow","date":"2016-06-14T04:10:43.247+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"you got banned?\nhehe xd","replies":[]}]}
