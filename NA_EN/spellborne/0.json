My sister's game loaded and the game started while I was still stuck on the loading screen, when my game did load it would not allow me to leave the base even though the barriers where down and everyone else left base. I logged out and then relogged on and finished the game with my team, so Im not understanding why i got leaver buster penalty. sigh thanks riot for not letting me have a chance.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-23T00:45:57.184+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Regardless of intention or reason for the slow reconnect, your absence still leaves your team behind and negatively impacts everyone in the match. Additionally, you'll never receive a low-priority queue penalty for a single match, as it takes a trend of disconnecting or going AFK before your account sees an LPQ.\n\nLet me know if this happens again or if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}
