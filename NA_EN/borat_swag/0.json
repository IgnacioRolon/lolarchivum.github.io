I even tried changing it to window mode through this file, and i managed to get in the game, but then, as i change it back to full screen (after reassuring the resolution is 1600x900) the error pops up again and i can't see a thing. another problem is, that when the error pops up, i still hear everything, but i can't minimize the client, nor exit with ALT+F4, tried everything, all i can do i force a restart by pressing the restart button on my computer. \r\nI need your help, thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-27T19:36:05.794+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What happens if you try loading windowed mode but with a lower resolution?
