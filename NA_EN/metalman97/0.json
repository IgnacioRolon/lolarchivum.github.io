Combined with the fact that there is no fulfillment on the weekends and there are definitely still some Thursday orders waiting to be shipped out.\n\nSorry for the hold up, but rest assured they are fulfilling as fast as humanly (literally) possible.\n\nFor some clarification on the overall process:\nAfter you place your order, you should receive an order confirmation email saying \"hey, we got your order! here's your order number and your order details\" and your order status should say processing.\nSome time later (usually same day) you should receive an invoice email saying \"we've charged your payment method!\"  Your order status will still say 'processing' but you now know that your paypal or credit card was charged.\nOnce the order is shipped, you'll receive a shipping confirmation email with a tracking number to track your shipment, and your order status will change to complete.\nThere are a couple of other order statuses besides processing and complete, but it would indicate that the order was cancelled or something along those lines.  Processing means that your order is still being fulfilled.  I would say if your order has been on the \"processing\" status for more than 7 days, write in a PS ticket at support.riotgames.com with your order number and we can reach out to our warehouse directly to see what happened with your order.  Usually this happens when the order was shipped out but failed to update in our systems.\n\nHope this helps!","replies":[{"poster":"Ferocitas","date":"2016-10-18T00:25:09.874+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm in Australia and got up 4:30am our time to order the game as it was released, I also still haven't received a shipping notification, but understand that it will take some time.

The invoice email would confirm that your order is in our system, and there might have been an issue with the email being sent out or it was filtered by spam or something.  I would suggest submitting a ticket so we can find your order number based on your e-mail address so you can use that order number to keep track of your order status on the merch site, but that's up to you if you really need it or not.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Metalman97","date":"2016-10-17T20:55:42.335+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the heads up!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Herazalila","date":"2016-10-17T17:45:21.140+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same here my order still processing and i had my order confirmation 6 min after the release.But I'm not really worried right now i can understand it's not easy for the riot merch guys.","replies":[{"poster":"Metalman97","date":"2016-10-17T18:23:18.645+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wonder if a Riot member could help clarify the whole processing issue.","replies":[{"poster":"Herazalila","date":"2016-10-18T10:09:22.148+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just recieve my shipping mail now , so  you should have your fast.\nCan't wait :).","replies":[{"poster":"Metalman97","date":"2016-10-18T17:25:21.132+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is noon here and I have yet to receive any mail from Riot.","replies":[{"poster":"th3mi5t","date":"2016-10-18T22:23:59.601+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It took a while, but finally got a tracking number.
