Its not going to change them over night. takes time. MSI proved how weak theyre communicating was. In one of their videos on their channel they described a lot of the changes they wanted to make to that. For example Bjerg and Santorin communicate 100x more then Santorin does with any of the other lanes.

So they are never fully ready for international play.\n\neh disagree with your \"keep bjerg from snowballing\" thing. Bjerg hasn't lost a laning phase yet so im not really sure what you're talking about. Hasn't even come close to having a negative K/D ratio yet this split either. TSM havnt been losing because Bjerg gets behind or something like that. They've been losing because their shotcalling and teamfighting have been bad. Their midgame this split is the worst its ever been. Take their first game against C9 for instance. Caught by enemy blue buff 3 times and destroyed because of rumble ulti. They didn't learn from their mistake.\n\nHas nothing to do with Bjerg getting behind in lane because he hasn't been behind in lane at all this split","replies":[{"poster":"Lugg","date":"2015-06-15T20:31:08.819+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Let me clarify. I agree that you can't expect to win lane from Bjerg, he is one of the best at CSing on the planet. You just have to keep jungle pressure on him and not let him get any free kills.

I don't know if other teams have him figured out now, or if it's something else.\n\nhe was 7/1/6 in the loss to Dig. with 45 more CS then the highest person on Dig. he was fed. The problem has nothing to do with Bjerg solo performance. He has the ability to have an impact in literally every game he has played so far. The problem comes in the mid game. The shot calling and decision making has been weird. The only death he had in the loss to Dig he just dove into the team randomly and got blown up and it ended up being the killing blow for them. They loss the game right after. They've kept jungle pressure on him but he still comes out big regardless.\n\nSantorin isn't even the problem right now. I agree his game has been off but its far from their biggest problem\n\nThe big problem is their mid game shot calling. Their loss to Cloud 9, TSM would have the advantage in a lot of engages but the second Bjerg got even to half hp, it seemed like he would tell the team to back off even though he still had a healthy front line in front of him. He was playing viktor so he had plenty of range to attack from. Like I already said, theyre changing the way they communicate to eachother and it seems to be messing up the system they used before that made them so dominant. But overall its a good thing. The system they used before got them crushed at MSI so it had to change. Theyre just going through growing pains right now. \n\nNo individual player is at fault with their performance right now. I hated Santorin after his beyond lackluster performance at MSI, but right now he's not the problem. Its just the team communication overall","replies":[{"poster":"Lugg","date":"2015-06-15T21:13:01.764+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think they need a new coach and a new strategy.

They've helped Dyrus more in the last 6 games then they have in forever. As for a coach, im not jumping the gun on that. Loco knows the problem and he has been trying to fix it since MSI. The big problem is the same problem the majority of NA teams have. NA plays too passively. You have Korea and China that lead the world in aggressive play. Now Fnatic and some of the other top EU teams have adapted so far this split and are playing aggressive as well. Meanwhile NA just sits on the back burner and does a slow control game but as we've seen everytime and worlds and most recently MSI, that play style wont work against the aggression of the other regions. Can't fault Loco for it when literally all of NA has the same problem haha\n\nEDIT: This also goes back to my last point. Theyre trying to improve communication overall. Bjerg and Santorin would communicate a lot. The other 2 lanes not so much. Turtle has lustboy but then Dyrus has no one. That's one positive to take away. Dyrus seems to be speaking up more with Santorin. In some of the highlight vids they showed after some of the games, you could actually hear Dyrus contributing to the shot calling which you didn't really hear so much before","replies":[{"poster":"Lugg","date":"2015-06-16T06:12:35.543+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's a great point on the passive play style in NA.
