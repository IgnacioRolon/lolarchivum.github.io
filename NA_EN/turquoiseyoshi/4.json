However, the current one gives Attack Speed worth much more than it costs. Now, how would you nerf this, while still keeping the identity of being very strong late game for on-hit effects? Make the Attack Speed scale with Devourer stacks. For example, every 3 stacks of Devourer, you get 5 Attack Speed. That would add up to 50% at Sated. \r\n\r\nYeah. That&#039;s it. There you go.

And other jungle items get stronger in the late game too: Cinderhulk has %-health-amplification, Runeglaive has an AP scaling, Warriors armor penetration scales with damage from other items. So that Devourer gets better is not really special. It is just that the idea of Sated Devourer is insane and stupid. Champions with built in on hit effects benefit way too much. Almost everyone is forced to build Botrk seconds, because it is op, there is no build diversity, and overall sated devourer is too strong in the late game.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"foinhas","date":"2015-08-23T01:50:13.777+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"daily reminder that devourer costs 2250 and not 1400","replies":[{"poster":"TurquoiseYoshi","date":"2015-08-23T01:57:02.371+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not sure what you're trying to say.
