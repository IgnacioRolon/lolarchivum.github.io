Not all the ADCs have an on hit effect by themselves\n2.  Not a lot of items apply an on hit effect ADCs want.  I mean an ADC could get ER but they don't.\n3.  The more on hit effects and AD you have, the better it is.  Sadly, 1 and 2 hurt here.\n4.  Side bolts don't apply crits (or let you stack vayne's silver bolts on multiple enemies)\n5.  ADCs have a lot of things they need to buy and not much room for anything else.\n6.  If you fall behind and need to wave clear at your base, you probably don't have the AD to clear fast enough.  Thus you can't pick this up when behind.\n7.  AS by itself is a pretty meh stat to have.  Some ADCs scale better off of AD or Crit.\n8.  Going back to 2, if this item had some form of nice on hit itself, it'd be better.  If the side bolts had a .6 or .7 AD scaling, it'd be better.\n9.  Because it isn't a high priority on many champs, the game might end before you can buy it.\n\nI like this item and I use it from time to time, but I understand it has issues.

If you are attacking 3 enemy champs, it gives you more damage than IE.  However against 1, it'd kind of weak.

Also as you said, could give it an on-hit effect as well, maybe like an armor reducing effect similar to wit's end.\n4.

Crits might work, but it'd probably have to be for a flat amount like 25-50 damage.\n\nA good on-hit effect for it is an issue though.  Teemo gets it.  Kayle gets it.  Kalista gets it.  It's got to be something both AP and AD ranged attackers would like.  \n\nI'd love to see splash damage like Kayle's E but that's a bit too much.  A small slow might work simply because ranged champs don't get frozen mallet on one hand, on the other you'd have to consider them kiting.  Thematically, a slow sounds best but I can't say if it'd work well from a balance standpoint.  Maybe something that lets you steal AS and MS for 2-3 seconds would be cool if the slow route is viable.  A small on hit true damage (10-20) might work.  A small on hit heal/mana recovery feature might work.  An on-hit CDR effect would be interesting to see.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Cindikle","date":"2015-07-31T21:50:04.436+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:22}} Can build it for gimmick reasons. \n{{champion:429}} Somewhat core item.\n{{champion:10}} Core item.\n{{champion:96}} Reasonable item. \n{{champion:17}} Core if building around his poison AA. \n{{champion:29}} Reasonable item.\n{{champion:110}} somewhat Core if AP.
