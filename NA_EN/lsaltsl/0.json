Heals entire team, can't catch her to retaliate, ALL the while she has nuke poke, gg.\r\n\r\nThose are the only hands down broken champions.\r\n\r\nSome recommended fixes:\r\n\r\n{{champion:1}} Annie is fine all around except for the fact her stun needs timer before it goes away. Infinite holding discourages ALL engage from the other team because of certain death.\r\n\r\n{{champion:222}} Jinx's Zap! is also unbearable but not beyond fixing. It needs either less damage, less range, or less slow.\r\n\r\n{{champion:9}} Fiddlestick's Bird is unreal for damage, but the biggest problem I have is how FAR the bird will travel between two targets, seems nearly lane wide.... Perhaps lower the damage, amount of targets it hits or just reduce its seeking range.\r\n\r\nEverything else translate pretty well except for the nevernerfed Morg Q two aram game long snare. But I know better to argue that anymore....","replies":[]}
