I was Gold III last season, but demoted due to inactivity after my PC crashed. All my friends who I played with last season are all high gold and plat this season. They don't want to play with me in Ranked because we \"always get bronze nubs\" , which I don't really agree with, but I can understand sometimes what they mean. (~~inb4 bashing on them~~). Anyways, back to my point, I just want to know who **YOU** personally use/used to carry yourself up the ladder. \r\n\r\nEDIT : I actually had a guy who told me he used {{champion:113}}  Support to carry himself to Platinum III. It's a pretty exciting concept.","replies":[{"poster":"Poro Princess","date":"2015-03-11T21:04:22.070+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I used Nami to carry me up to Plat 4 100LP and then I never finished my promos before season ended :C","replies":[]},{"poster":"EwokSoldier","date":"2015-03-11T19:32:39.615+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I dont think zyra or janna in my opinion are the best to carry from the support role. They are really good at disengage and peeling in a \"proper\" teamfight are exceptionally strong. But in lower elo there are not really \"proper\" 5v5 teamfights. Its mostly 4v5's 2v3's or just on person gettin caught out. Supports that can make picks in my opinion are much more likely to carry. Such as thresh leona blitz nami etc. \n\nJanna and zyra are very strong but when you are ahead it is much more difficult to make plays because there kit is more defensive. And even if you play zyra and janna perfectly it is heavily reliant on the ability of your teammates to follow up you play and if the misposition vs a hard engage comp they will get deleted before you can even begin to peel.\n\nI have 2 acc in plat now one is Plat 2 other is Plat 4\n\nstrong overall decent picks in my opinion:\nthresh nami and leona in the support role\nJarvan vi and amumu in jungle\nBrand orianna fizz in the mid lane\nRenekton Irelia Olaf in the top lane\nLucian Jinx ezreal as adc","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rawrful","date":"2015-03-11T02:49:40.915+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Last season it was {{champion:41}}  and {{champion:78}}  to high gold with ease because no one knows how to handle them, and when they get fed they snowball hard.","replies":[]},{"poster":"2000boxes","date":"2015-03-11T02:45:01.212+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i used\nzed, sion, wukong, rammus, graves, vayne, thresh, morgana, and soraka\ni basically play any role i get my hands on","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shiroi Kitsune","date":"2015-03-10T23:03:01.936+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:113}} jungle.

Though Season 4 was a bit tougher and had to switch roles up and went with jungle {{champion:28}} as she can just demolish people and they never saw it coming. That's how I then got from B2 to GV in Season 4.  Haven't tried this season though, but I do love supporting the most, so I'd still say {{champion:40}}  is a great pick in that area as she has tons of power.","replies":[]},{"poster":"aperson1","date":"2015-03-10T22:00:21.575+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ashe is a pretty good ADC.
