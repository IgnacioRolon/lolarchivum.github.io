Syndra&#039;s spheres could be like pink or something, or even Shaco&#039;s clone something other than green. I know that this is still in PBE, so changes may not be final, but on a similar note I started getting upset about this when the Valentine&#039;s Day Annie skin came out.

Let's say they do fix the clipping issue, they still have to go back and re check EVERTHING to make sure that the addition/removal of the code doesn't negatively affect anything else.

That's it.\n\nIn some specific cases it might take a little bit longer because of multi-textured particles (cho'gath's W, IIRC, has a file for the base white in it and a different one for the blue ripples, for example), in which case you'd have to recolor multiple files (unless you only want to change one of the multiple colors), but it's still something you can do in a couple of minutes as long as you know which files to change (and considering they work / make those skins, they _know_ which files to change)\n\nas an example, here's the file that determines the color of jayce's hammer form particles (taken from debonair jayce, but it's the same as his base skin): (attached at the end of the post because I don't know how to put an image in the middle of the post)\n\nI open it on photoshop, now press Ctrl + U to open a Hue/Saturation window, and can literally just move the Hue (color) slider to get, for example, Red particles for hammer-form jayce.

You saw a champion, TF, who has a skin you could build a theme off of. That skin happens to have no particle effects, which makes it the perfect theme to use to for a 750 skin line (well, besides the fact Jack of Hearts TF is 520).\n\nA player however buys a skin with the goal of fulfilling a fantasy. That might be a personal fantasy, or one they have for the champion itself. We also don't really care about your goal of keeping skins in a theme the same price, or even expanding skins in the 750 price range (which admittedly is amusing, considering the complaints about too many 1350 level skins and not enough cheaper ones). What we care about is the skin living up to it's maximum potential. \n\nSo when we see a skin like Queen of Diamonds Syndra, that doesn't really have any diamonds involved (beyond jewellery and patterns on a dress), it's disappointing.
