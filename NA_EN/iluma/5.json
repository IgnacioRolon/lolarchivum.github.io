I wasn't too familiar with her for a while, so I thought it was basic mana based attack, but she can even stop ults!

But you should've baited her spell shield. People forget that these days. Easy counter to champs, bait out their moves.","replies":[{"poster":"iLuma","date":"2015-03-10T20:40:32.576+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That whole team fight, I thought she had already used it!
