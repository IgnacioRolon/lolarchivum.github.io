Now, one might induce an answer from the champion and spell icons, but if that is indeed a hint, it is remarkably obtuse. For example, and this is accepting as a given that the icons are a hint, two different people could very easily see two different connections between those icons and Pokemon, and thus arrive at two different answers.\n\nWhile many who think that's a hint would guess a Ghost-type, Bard could be referring to anything. His mask might mean Yamask. His Magical Journey ability might mean Mismagius, the Magical Pokemon.\n\nBy contrast, if you'd picked {{item:3142}} as a hint, this would have been considerably easier.\n\nThat being said, I don't think it's anything from generation 1, 4, 6, or 7, because few, if any, from those generations are comparable to Bard. Narrowing it down further to the ones with the most possible resemblance among ghost-types (An easy task, considering most of them are malevolent clouds or possessed objects of some sort.), I get the impression that it's either Dusclops or Yamask. Ultimately, I've decided to guess **Dusclops**, since Yamask seems more like a Meep.\n\nOf course, all of that conjecture assumed that those icons were a hint. If the icons have no bearing, then one may as well roll a d700.","replies":[]},{"poster":"unban swifty","date":"2015-03-14T05:02:16.943+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Umbreon?!
