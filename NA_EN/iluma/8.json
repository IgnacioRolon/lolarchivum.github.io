If you have many, please continue sharing! <3**_\n\nSECOND UPDATE :\n\nI've decided to have a little more fun and give some others a chance, too! I'll be also giving away a Champion/Skin for the person's joke who has the most UPVOTES from the community. :) \n\n**A total of TWO prizes will be given away! Only a few hours left before it's time to decide!! <3**\n\nTHIRD UPDATE :\n\nWe're almost to a close with only 1hr40m left! Make sure to vote for your favorite jokes (or in this case it seems the counter-joke is actually at the top) and post your own! \n\n**Btw, don't go stealing other peoples' posts. There are time stamps for a reason, y'know. -_-**\n\nAfter I announce the winners, I will add them personally and we can discuss your prizes. I will add you winners to this post so others can see what you won! This has been a great turnout, so definitely expect to see more freebie contests in the near future. :3\n\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n\n~~****FINAL UPDATE :\n\nFor optional fun, if you guys get this post to at least 150 upvotes, I'll gift a 3rd skin to a random poster. :) Boom!****~~\n\n\n\n**CLOSED CLOSED CLOSED CLOSED CLOSED CLOSED CLOSED CLOSED CLOSED CLOSED CLOSED CLOSED CLOSED CLOSED CLOSED CLOSED CLOSED CLOSED CLOSED CLOSED CLOSED CLOSED CLOSED CLOSED CLOSED CLOSED CLOSED CLOSED CLOSED CLOSED CLOSED CLOSED CLOSED CLOSED CLOSED CLOSED CLOSED CLOSED CLOSED CLOSED CLOSED CLOSED CLOSED CLOSED CLOSED CLOSED CLOSED CLOSED CLOSED CLOSED !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nThank you everybody for participating!

Let's find something bigger to throw into the pit.\"\n\nThey found a decent sized boulder, struggled to move it to the hole and heaved it over the edge into the abyss. They listened..... Nothing.\n\nNo sound whatsoever. \"Holy cow! This must be miles deep!!! Let's find something even bigger!\"\n\nThey spread out and started looking. One of them soon called out from the edge  of the clearing \"HEY I FOUND A HUGE LOG!\"\n\nThey spent about an hour and a half, inch by inch, scooting the log closer to the edge of the hole.\n\nThey finally plunged the log into the stomach of the pit and listened.... all of the sudden they heard some rustling in the bushes towards where they found the log.\n\nAND OUT OF NOWHERE A GOAT LUNGEd FORWARD OUT OF THE FOREST CHARGING THE GUYS!!!\n\n\"What the...\" Said one. \"Is that a...?\" Said the other.
