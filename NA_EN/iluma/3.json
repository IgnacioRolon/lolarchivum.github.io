I will reveal the contest in a new post, along with the rules and regulations. Just a note, if you end up winning, _remember it does take a day or two after adding you to get the gift_ because . . . well rito. Also, **upvoting really helps** and gives me incentive to keep doing this. I love helping you guys out and I love giving free gifts. :3 plus, like usual, if the post reaches **150 upvotes**, I'll give another skin. If it somehow reaches **300 upvotes**, I'll give **ANOTHER** skin. So that's **TWO** skins off the top along with however many winners I choose from the contest. :)\n\nSome of the ideas you guys have posted are absolutely hilarious, haha.
