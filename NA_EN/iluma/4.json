(Win a FREE Skin/Champion!)","subforum":"Memes & Games","up_votes":169,"down_votes":4,"body":"Wow, I&#039;m surprised my post that was leading up to the actual contest got so many upvotes and replies. o-o That&#039;s amazing guys, thank you!\n\nNOW, let&#039;s get down to business! ~~(to defeat the huns)~~\n\n.\n.\n.\n\n\n**\"Are You Afraid of the Dark\" Contest**\n\n\nBased on the popular 90s Nickelodeon TV show _\"Are You Afraid of the Dark\"_, this contest is to see who can create the best horror/suspense story synopsis using a League of Legends character. Now remember, this is just the **synopsis** , not the entire drawn out story. I want you as a storyteller to be able to drag me into your story before the story even begins. \n\n.\n.\n_EXAMPLE:_\n\n**The Tale of the Toxic Terror**\n\n_Billy was a young child, often teased about for his looks. Unlike the rather popular kids, Billy had greasy hair, shaggy clothes and unfortunate acne. One quiet evening, Billy stumbled upon a shiny golden coin; on its face read the words \"Make a Wish, but Be-\". Ignoring the lack of the sentence and grabbing the coin tight, Billy wished for nothing more than to fit in and look like the others. In an instant, an evil chuckle was heard in the distance, as the coin began to rust into an eerie brown, revealing another message underneath the golden paint -- \"Beware the Twitch\"._\n\n{{champion:29}} \n.\n.\n.\n\n\n**RULES:**\n\n1) As a nod to the great franchise that was, you must title your piece **\"The Tale of the ______\" .** EX: _\"The Tale of the Ghastly Grinner\"_ or _\"The Tale of the Crimson Clown\"_\n\n2) Your entry must center around **a particular champion and/or champions**. As much as I know everybody wants to say \"_The Tale of the Noob AFKer_\", that entry will not be valid. X3\n\n3) Basic English Class, my friends. Paragraphs are **at least 3-7 sentences**. It&#039;s not that hard, truly. ~\n\n4) I will be selecting **one winner as my personal favorite**, and **a second winner** as the comment with the **most upvotes** _(you should know me by now<3)_\n\n5) I will also be adding the raffle winner from the previous post in the pool of victors once this contest ends. Essentially, anybody who said anything relating to _\"scary league story\"_ will get entered. Don&#039;t worry, I&#039;ve already got a screen cap of all the entries, so no trying to change your answer. u__u\n\n6) Put your stories&#039; Champion Thumbnail at the bottom of each entry so I know you read the rules. ^.~\n\n7) This is **NOT** North America bound. If you live in Europe, Oceania or other servers, feel free to enter! Even if you&#039;ve won one of my previous contests, you can still compete! **EVERYBODY is eligible**. ^_^\n\n8) **You can enter as many tales as you like**. Nobody is bound by one entry. Let your imagination go wild!\n\n9) Last but not least, you guys remember I noted in the last post, if this post gets **150 upvotes** I will gift an additional skin/champion & if it reaches **300 upvotes** I will gift ANOTHER skin/champion. That&#039;s a total of **FIVE (5) winners** at the end of the contest!\n\n.\n.\n\nAlas, that is all I have to say for now! Check the OP regularly for updates. I will be closing this contest tomorrow evening **Wednesday 7:00PM Central Time**! \n\n.\n.\n.\n\n_Submitted for the approval of the Midnight Society, I officially declare this contest **OPEN**!_\n\n.\n.\n.\nUPDATE!\n\nI know you guys have a couple trolls here down-voting all your posts. No worries. **The community should far outweigh the trolls.** And even if you have -5 in the votes, that does **NOT** mean you are not still eligible to win the contest. I pay attention to everyone and give everyone a fair share.\n\nYou guys are doing wonderful by the way and I really enjoy reading these stories. Now, this was original supposed to be \"_story synopsis_\", but I can't not appreciate the work you're putting towards these tales. **So keep up the great work! **If you want to add the synopsis to the bottom of your OP, you're more than welcome to. Long story short, keep it up! You guys are amazing! **Don't forget to keep up-voting!**\n\nIt's funny, truly. My post that was promoting THIS contest is now** the number one up-voted post in the Memes & Games section**. Haha.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nUPDATE!\n\nDay Two is upon us and these stories are looking absolutely wonderful! **Only a few hours until it's time to close the contest! **\n\nI hope you guys had as much writing these as I enjoy reading these.

Abandoned and alone, he found himself wandering throughout Runeterra until he was captured. A wealthy merchant saw great promise in the boy and gave him a chance of redemption. If he could throw his sword and kill one of his cows, he would be taken in as his son. If not, he would be sentenced as a fighter in the pits. Knowing he only had one shot, he threw his sword as hard as he could and sliced the head straight off of a bull. The merchant was, of course, impressed. However, he sought to further increase his wealth. With the new head of the cow, he could perform a transmutation; he could make the ultimate fighter. Alas, he needed a host.  \n> \n> Merog slept in the merchant's house that night, finally content on becoming a part of society. Twisted by pursuit of affluence, the merchant crept into Merog's room. Without hesitation, the boy was decapitated. With this new body, the merchant could create the ultimate fighter. Using dark magic, the cow head was attached to the body of the boy.  That morning, the chimera was sent to the pits. Enraged, he slaughtered everything in his path. \n> \n> After years of fighting, a small voice spoke in the chimera's head. It was Merog, twisted by angst and loathing. He sought revenge against all of those who put him there. The next morning, the town was empty. Soon, he would go against the world, and nobody could stop him.\n> \n> {{champion:12}}\n\n.\n.\n.\n\nThe winner for the Community Choice is . . . **KimJongUlt**\n\n> [{quoted}](name=KimJongUlt,realm=NA,application-id=Ir7ZrJjF,discussion-id=pF15cG0A,comment-id=0030,timestamp=2015-07-21T17:17:36.968+0000)\n>\n> The Tale of the Broken Bully\n> \n> Of all the children for Rufus Brandy to pick on, none was an easier target than the funny little boy from the family of clowns.

Finally. Finally, I can show those who doubted my magic, my powers, those who said I was just a rich Noxian girl with more money than talent.\n> \n> I look up at my mentor as he stops, his white hair and pale skin flashing with the scarlet of his elaborate clothes in the darkness of the chamber we stand in. He raises a hand, slowly undulating his fingers in the air.

My heart starts beating faster and faster as I struggle to move, to do anything, and it’s only when I realize that my heart is beating beyond just the simple response to fear that I try to scream.\n> \n> “Don’t worry,” The blood mage says, turning around and kneeling in front of me with soft eyes and a sad little smile. “I always keep my word: I _will_ bring out the best in you.”\n> \n> The knife slides across my throat, and he doesn't even blink as his ashen hair and skin are stained scarlet. Pain burns at my throat, my heart pumping away my life as my body is held still by his magic. He reaches up a hand, gently stroking my cheek with the back of his fingers as I struggle, and only tears manage to escape the prison that is now my own body.\n> \n> “Shh… just let it out. There will be no pain from your passing. No one will suspect this was anything but you finally taking the easy way out of Noxus. So... your sorrow, your pain, your everything… just let it just _drain_ away.”\n> \n> I give one last effort to scream as an icy cold begins tingling through my body.

She can’t wait to learn, to show everyone just how powerful she was, to show that it wasn’t just her riches that made her powerful. Suddenly the man with the pale skin, white hair, and elaborate red robes stops in the dark room, raising a hand. The girl’s arm raises of its own accord, raising her very own knife to her throat. She tries in vain horror to move, to scream, to do anything, but her body remains out of her control. The blood mage turns around and kneels before the girl, gently brushing her cheek with remorseful eyes and a gentle, understanding smile. Even as the girl draws the knife across her own neck, trying to scream in terror, he keeps the smile and remains unflinching, his ashen skin and hair being stained scarlet as he forces her to commit a crime no one will ever suspect him of… a sympathetic suicide.\n> \n> {{champion:8}}\n\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Gorozora,realm=NA,application-id=Ir7ZrJjF,discussion-id=pF15cG0A,comment-id=00a4,timestamp=2015-07-22T10:54:05.489+0000)\n>\n> The Tale of the Depths\n>                  \n>                      _Darkness.

A lurching creak sounded from much deeper in the water. The fear began to control my entire body as the sound of scraping metal came closer and closer, overpowering the pouring rain on water. Closer and closer it wrought, threatening to overpower my sanity. I knew not what was more frightful, the crashing storm above more or that mind bending scraping from below. The scraping was so loud now that it consumed all other sound. Deciding nothing could be worse than that horrible, blood chilling sound, I desperately charged toward the surface. Just as I breached the waves, gasping for air, I felt it. A cold metal grip on my leg. And then I was down, being drug into the darkness. I should have listened.

Oh how he had dreamed that his own mother would return, holding him tight and promising never to leave him again, only to realize he didn't even remember her face. Sometimes in his dreams he would have visions of a forgotten time. A palace in Shurima, the shadow of the mighty ascended brothers of legend, the light reflecting off of the glorious sun disc...

Although they were mostly harmless jokes, many of the villagers began to mistrust the boy and often ignored him. However, one night the boy began to have nightmares of the terrifying laugh of a sinister Jack-in-the-Box that startled him awake each night. The boy grew exhausted from lack of rest and tried to approach his friends to seek their advice on his predicament.  They merely laughed at him, which drove the poor terror-filled lad into despair. The nightmares continued, becoming more vivid each night. The boy tried various methods to show the village the honesty of his claim, making his own replicas of the Jack-in-the-Box from his nightmare and even at one point dressing up as a jester himself, as his wits were becoming quite frayed from the contempt the village showed him and his own lack of sleep. One night, a new nightmare entered the boy's shattered mind while he attempted to sleep: darkness, a void with no boxes or jesters, containing only a voice which whispered to the boy, poisoning him against the villagers and their ignorance, and promising to help him get his revenge. When he awoke, his hand was clutching a dagger, and his heart was full of a new purpose, to enlighten the fools who had refused the wisdom he offered.

Her parents often busy were never around for her to converse with, but this didn't bother her one bit. Well enough off to afford loads of dolls and delights her room was stocked with fine playmates to pass the time with, and pass the time she did. Her favorite toy was oddly enough her oldest. A patched teddy bear that had survived years of wear and tear. Her father had given her it the day before he left on a month long business trip. He had named it Tibbers. Why? Because Tibbers would prevent the shivers coming from the cold winter nights. For this reason Tibbers was the source of warmth to her throughout her days and nights.\n\nYears later Annie finally received something she wanted more than anything, a friend. A little boy moved in next door and after watching him carefully through her second story window she mustered up enough courage to ask her mother if she could go play with him.  To her surprise her mother was delighted and encouraged her to go play with the little boy thinking to herself all this time spent alone being homeschooled might be spoiling her socially. Unfortunately how little she knew.\n\nJohnathan and Annie became the best of friends and were inseparable at times. The only thing her mom had warned then after constantly hearing the giggles and shuffling coming from the upstairs room was don't get into any trouble, but as with all kids trouble was exactly what they found. You see Annie was special in a very peculiar way. She had always loved Tibbers because of the warmth he provided her until one day Tibbers had been left in the tool shed during a game of hide and seek and when she went to retrieve him she saw as a box of matches near the bear slowly started to burn red and ignite. To her surprise she yanked Tibbers away worried he might catch fire, as he lay hot in her hands she willed the heat away from him and she watched as a small fireball flew and ignited some wood shavings. Afraid of her new power she quickly ran away and his in her room. Her dad just barely saw the smoke before getting in the car to go to work. He quickly extinguished the fire and sought Annie to ask her if she was playing with matches. Her response was nervous but deliberate \"I never play with matches.\"\n\nThe secret was burning a hole inside of her and she desperately needed someone to tell. She figured who better to trust this secret with than her new friend Johnathan. She explained everything to him. He sat skeptical at first but Annie was prepared and in the privacy of the woods behind their houses she organized a small circle of rocks with some twigs in the center. She cast her hands and motioned towards the twigs and a small fireball lit them a blaze. Johnny who had spent time camping with his dad sat in wonder and told Annie how cool it was and thanked her for the warmth on the cool fall afternoon. Annie told Johnnie don't thank me silly. Thank Tibbers. He is the source of the warmth in the first place. Johnathan thought it was silly to think a stuffed teddy bear was alive but not wanting to hurt Annie's feelings kept this comment to himself.\n\nAnnie awoke this morning to one of her favorite holidays out of the whole year, Halloween. Her mom had finally said this year she was old enough to go trick or treating by herself and no doubt she would be going with her friend Johnathan. She had told him about her prom queen dress that she would be wearing but no matter how much she begged, Johnathan would not tell her what he was going as. He told her it was a surprise and that was the end of that. As darkness crept down over their small street she waited in her front yard near an oak tree where they had promised to meet. Nearly giving up hope she stumbled across a small hand written note. The note said \"I'm back in the wood shed if you're not too much of a scaredy cat come and find me.\" Johnathan child like signature was crudely scribbled beneath the message. Annie not wanting to show how frightened she actually was slowly crept up to the wood shed in the darkness of the night. Slowly she called out \n\n\"Johnathan?\" No answer.\n\nThe door slowly creaked  as she opened it. Total darkness around made her hands tremble even more. She heard a subtle movement and quickly yelped \n\n\"Johnathan?!\" \n\nSuddenly a monstrous bear resembling Tibbers leapt out at her with a evil grin on its face and it screamed\n\n \"No, Tibbers!\" \n\nShe raised her hands to her face and willed the monstrous version of her companion to go away. And go away it did, a monstrous blaze ignited the creature and its screams echoed around Annie as it wreathed in pain. Annie ran away back into her house only to find the real Tibbers exactly the same as she had left it. Soft cuddly, and most important of all **warm**.\n\nJohnathan was never found again and thankfully for Annabelle Tibbers has never been anywhere near that frightful; however, Annie has never felt that sort of terrifying fear since. She did go look for johnny once more in the tool shed days later but all she ever found was some soot and ashes. She guessed her only one and true faithful friend was her warm cuddly Tibbers after all.\n\nFor your approval.\n\nHope you guys enjoy I'll edit for grammar tomorrow before the end sorry in advance it was written on a mobile phone with auto correct.\n{{champion:1}} \n\nThe edit was for grammar and clarity, it's still far from perfect but I hope you guys enjoy it anyway.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Revering","date":"2015-07-23T03:32:37.824+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"When will the winners be announced?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Revering","date":"2015-07-22T22:54:15.376+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The Tale of the Cursed Carnival\n\nAndrea was an innocent child at the age of seven. She enjoyed everything a \"normal\" girl did : barbies, dressing up, makeup, etc. Her parents were loving people, but they were often busy working out of state. You see, her father and mother were hotel critics working for a magazine blog. Thus, she was often left with a babysitter who goes by the name of Serena. Serena, you see, wasn't the most responsible of babysitters. She would often leave Andrea alone at the house while she went to hang out with her friends, but Andrea had no problem with taking care of herself. \n\nOne night, Andrea was mischievously putting on her mother's makeup while Serena was watching television in the other room. The babysitter's phone rang, and upon answering it, it was her boyfriend, Chase. Chase had invited her to the carnival nearby. \"Isn't it closed at this time of night?\" she responded. \"It'll be alright. My brother works there, so he can get us in with no charge.\" Chase continued. Serena began to get excited, until Chase informed her that he would have to be bringing his younger cousin. \"I'm supposed to be babysitting her, and my parents would kill me if I left her at home alone.\" he stated. Serena admitted that she was babysitting her neighbor's daughter, and Andrea could tag along. \"The two of them could play together while we rode a few rides!\" she exclaimed happily.\n\nLater that night, the four of them met up and were walking to the front gate of the carnival. Andrea still wore her mother's makeup, and was slightly upset that Serena was in a hurry and wouldn't let her take it off. \"Come on. I look like a clown!\" She had complained earlier. \"Well, then I suppose you'll fit in quite nicely!\" Serena had responded with a smirk. As planned, the two younger girls played together on the carousel while Chase and Serena went off to ride a few of the bigger rides. It took no time at all before the two teens had stumbled upon the haunted house. Serena was quite the wimp, but Chase convinced her that it would all be okay. \n\nAs the ride began, they both see a clown, and they assumed it was simply a part of the ride. \"This will be **fun**.\" The \"machine\" stated as the ride began. Chase chuckled, assuring Serena that he was simply an added fear factor. All throughout the ride, they kept seeing glimpses of the clown, as if the \"machine\" had been following them. He had been performing for them. In different areas, they would see him juggling, throwing knives at a target board, and so on. The ride had stopped, and it was over. However, there the clown stood in front of the exit. Serena laughed at it, as she had been brushing him off the whole ride. Playfully, Chase called out, \"Whatcha' got for us now?\" There was a moment of silence as the clown spoke. \"Now you see me, **now** you don't.\" In a puff of smoke the clown disappeared. The two gasped in amazement, laughing as they exited the cart. \"How'd the owners manage to pull **that** off?\" they thought.  In another puff of smoke, the clown was behind them. \"Now, for my next trick, I'll make **you** disappear.\" \n\nScreams arose from the haunted house, but none were heard by the little girls. The two of them talked about everything they had done that day, as soon, a shadow stepped out from behind a building. Chase's little cousin gasped in delight before pointing to the direction of the clown emerging from the shadows. \"Look, Andrea! Isn't it cute?\" Andrea turned her head and smiled, the two of them giggling. The clown knelt down to the little girls with a demonic grin, observing  the makeup on Andrea. \"Look, Mister! Andrea's a clown too!\" Andrea giggled, along with the other girl. \"Well, don't you two just look **ravishing**?\" Andrea smiled. \"I look just like you!\" And with that, the clown laughed devilishly before disappearing in a puff of smoke.\n\nWeeks later, the girls were in the hands of their parents, and police hadn't found the missing teenagers from that night. Andrea constantly spoke of a clown, but the authorities never gave her that much thought, for she was simply a child.

Nervous but wanting to look awesome, he went in and walked around until he made it to shaco. He took a box and stuck it in a bag he brought in. Coming out, they went back to their makeshift home. When they get home he shows them the item. They put it in a corner and go to bed. All night they hear footsteps around their home, and at times laughter. The kid wakes up after a long night to find his friends ready to go out and want to check something out. He decides to stay home and relax. After a bit he begins to see shaco, but that can't be since he is just a statue, Right? That night he hears something walking around INSIDE the house. In his dreams he sees shaco beckoning toward the jack in the box. The boy is now paranoid and tells his friends about his dreams. The next day he awakes to find multiple jack in the box toys that had been sold, around. Thinking this must be a sign shaco wants his box back the boy sneaks past security and replaces the box infront of the statue, Something pokes his back and he sees a green shaco, and this one mouths thanks and beckons to follow him. Believing this thing was showing him another exit for replacing the box. He followed the thing to a backroom which, as he entered, he realized had some blood around it. He tries the door but it is locked. The green shaco turns around and smiles, then mouthes the words \"Don't try to take my possessions\" Then disappears never to be seen again, just like the boy.\n{{champion:35}}\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"Lycaon1","date":"2015-07-21T18:54:06.117+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Was this loosely based on the _Are You Afraid of the Dark?_ episode with Zeebo the clown?","replies":[]}]}]}
