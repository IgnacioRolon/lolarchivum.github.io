I put to much time into this game and it saddens me to see this happen to me. I hope someone from Riot reads this and decided to help me. Ive never given my account to anyone not even IRL friends that play league. Ive even tweeted to Riot Support but the last time they answered was 15 hours ago and said that would send a specialist soon. Im just posting on here to get some more eyes on the situation/ covering all the bases.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-06T19:20:33.086+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We'd like to look into this and help you!
