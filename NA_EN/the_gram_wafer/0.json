I've consistantly ranked bronze every time I have played ranked and my KDA is almost always subpar. Occasionally I will have a good game where I do well and have a positive KDA, but those games are few and far between. At this point I have probably played nearly 2000 normal matches and spent thousands of dollars on skins. I woke up this morning to join my friends in playing league only to find that my account had been banned for the use of third party programs and I don't know why. I've never used third party programs and never felt like I needed to. League is not a competitive game for me. I play it to have fun with my friends. I don't know why I would be banned for this other than trolls reporting my account for no reason. \r\n\r\nSomebody please help me,\r\nThe Gram Wafer","replies":[]}
