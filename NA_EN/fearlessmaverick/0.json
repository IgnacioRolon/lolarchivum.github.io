I've tried the alt-enter combo and it does change from \"fullscreen\" to \"windowed\" but that just means it gets a little smaller. My taskbar still (newly upon today) takes priority over League even in Fullscreen Mode. Seems to be my game is stuck on windowed mode even though I am under the fullscreen setting in the video options. Tried Hextech Repair, tried repatching. No effect. Thoughts guys? Help?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-23T01:53:42.221+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow that must be frustrating. There might be something weird going on with your configuration files, so let's try giving those a hard reset. Navigate to where you installed league (default C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends), find your Config folder, and delete it! Once you restart the game, League will recreate those files and hopefully that taskbar will stay out of the way!","replies":[{"poster":"FearlessMaverick","date":"2017-05-25T00:22:39.876+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So I tried it and it works great!
