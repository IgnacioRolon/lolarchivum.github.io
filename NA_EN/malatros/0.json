This also keeps me in the loop regarding my friends if they decide to do a summoner name change. It would be awesome if when you type in the search section it also searches through your friend notes.\r\n\r\nFor example, if I type in \"James\" I would see all summoner names and summoner's with \"James\" in their notes section.\r\n\r\nWhat does everyone think?","replies":[]}
