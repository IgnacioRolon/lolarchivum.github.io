I've been keeping with the upcoming missions, wanting my championship ashe icon + border. However, when I logged in and clicked on the missions icon, one of them disappeared immediately, having been marked as done for no reason. I did not receive any tokens for 'completing' it. And the other mission was the worlds pickem one, which I completed and got 5 tokens. In the missions list (http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/esports/esports-editorial/worlds-2017-missions-loot) it mentions that it should have 20 tokens up for grabs, but i was only able to earn 5 this week. Is this a bug, or is it intentional?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-16T20:25:55.870+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Typically the missions pop up a little later in the day, have you seen those show up yet?\n\nKinda weird that a mission would just disappear unless maybe the timer had run out before you completed it. These missions do run on a timer, some a few days, some a week or so, and a few have been longer.","replies":[]},{"poster":"crystallise24","date":"2017-10-16T17:37:23.960+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am having the same issue too, its monday and no missions have come up.
