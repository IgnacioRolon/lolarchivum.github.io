Spending money does not exempt you magically from the rules. Everyone is treated equally regardless of money spent, and if you're unwilling and/or unable to follow the rules and interact with others in a mature and respectful manner then Riot and the LoL community don't want you here.\n2. The mute button =/= a get out of jail free card. It is there to help prevent further toxicity, not condone it or give you an excuse to behave like a jerk.\n3. If the people getting permabanned truly valued their account then they should have thought of that before reaching that point.

Thus in their eyes, they have already written off the toxic player as a paying client.\n\n>From a business standpoint, do they want to remove the toxic guy who has spent $500 but is causing a negative environment for 4-9 other players in every game? Those non-toxics are also spending $500 and probably will spend more, promote the game more when they are enjoying the game AND they won't cause a negative environment.\n\n>I personally think it is a fine argument to protect the ones that are paying money and aren't toxic rather than protecting the ones that may pay the same amount but are toxic.\n\nThe bottom line is that this is is not a matter of being a snitch or thin-skinned, it's a matter of not wanting players who only want to cause trouble for others in the game. If you can't or won't interact with others in a mature and respectful manner then multiplayer online games are just not for you.\n\nP.S.
