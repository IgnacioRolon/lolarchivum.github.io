Her attack range is shorter than most ADCs, so she's easy to poke out and punish when she goes for CS. Her damage also gets tanked by minions really easily, so it's hard for her to apply pressure in lane.\n\nShe snowballs crazy hard and has all the tools needed to fly in and assassinate someone, but she's worse in the laning phase than a lot of other ADCs.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Warlord Rhinark","date":"2018-12-12T07:52:24.113+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Having a safe childhood.\n\nShe failed miserably in this regard.","replies":[]},{"poster":"craz√ø","date":"2018-12-12T07:24:40.925+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"she is`t strong **vs** tanks now.\nthey nerf her passive that`s enough \n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2018-12-12T05:12:47.033+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You said it yourself: no CC whatsoever.

Even when he's weak, he still feels overbearing to me just because of all the shit he has. It's the same for a lot of champions tbh.
