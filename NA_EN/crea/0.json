Changes, however, are things we're happy to consider and act upon. For example, we changed Blood Moon Elise's color several times (pink, to red, to a happy medium) before deciding on the final color. That decision was based on a couple of things; player's nearly 50/50 split on which color they'd prefer, so we went with a medium between red and pink. It was also based on making sure the skin was cohesive with the Blood Moon skin line - some initial player reactions were that the pink looked more like Heartseeker, rather than Blood Moon, and we felt similarly. \n\nKeep in mind, that while not everything suggested may be acted upon/changed, we do discuss the feedback that comes in via the boards! :]","replies":[{"poster":"5G8Nri0B54","date":"2015-01-13T03:15:09.347+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"The Elise skin doesn't affect me all that much because despite maining her upon release, she's...kinda unplayable atm...having skin for champions you don't play is kinda pointless for me >_>\n\nHOWEVER, what caught my attention was \n\n> (pink, to red, to a happy medium)\n\nAs any psychology major will tell you, compromises are best left as a **last resort** because it gets the job done, but in a way where no one is completely satisfied.\n\nNext time such a thing happens, may I suggest...\n\nCreating a **gigantic discussion thread** inviting only players who own Elise/said champion the skin is for?

As for this skin, there really isn't much more to discuss. It's on live, and more changes won't be made to the skin. \n\nWith that being said, I will say there was a **ton** of discussion around the color of the skin in meetings, thanks to everyone's comments on the boards. I spent several nights digging through these boards, Reddit, Surrender@20, SkinSpotlights videos, etc, screenshotting posts, and compiling feedback into a presentable form for the next meeting. I made sure both sides were heard each time. So, while it may have not been a thread of 'hey, what do you think?' - multiple players' threads and comments were brought up and discussed when it came down to making a final call.","replies":[{"poster":"Tendrian","date":"2015-01-13T04:41:29.785+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I think for future content, a thread like that could be super useful, and it's something I've written down should something like this happen again.
