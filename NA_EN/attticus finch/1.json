What you said was quite clearly a disparaging statement about the sorts of people who might disagree with the OP.\n\nI do not think you are biased for thinking that people should be more free to speak, and thinking that people should use mute instead of getting offended.\n\nI do however, think you are biased for thinking that insultees who have trouble muting their insultors are somehow stupid or inferior to those insultors.\n\nSee my response to the OP:\n\n> [{quoted}](name=HalcyonDweller,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=UX97H74l,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2017-12-06T23:12:14.566+0000)\n>\n> I agree that players should know better and should have the wherewithal to mute a player who bullies them, but people lack self-awareness and self control.\n> \n> If you want to hold players at fault for not realizing that they can and should mute others, then out of fairness you should also hold players at fault for losing their temper and harassing their teammates who annoy them.\n\nBoth sorts show the same lack of self-restraint.","replies":[{"poster":"vgamedude","date":"2017-12-07T00:07:17.386+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So wanting everyone even people talking down or bad to me to be allowed to say things without heavy handed and greedy censorship on riots part is only defending people who agree with me?

Please do not mistake me for somebody who thinks we should go around censoring people who say things we do not like. I was simply pointing out that you left no room in your definition of 'sides' of this debate for anybody to reside in the middle-ground.\n\nIt is not just 'us or them' there are a spectrum of opinions on this matter. Attempting to paint anyone who does not fully agree with and support you as being 100% against you does nothing to further the conversation, and it actually insults and pushes aside moderate people who might have otherwise been persuaded by your argument.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"HalcyonDweller","date":"2017-12-06T23:12:14.566+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I agree that players should know better and should have the wherewithal to mute a player who bullies them, but people lack self-awareness and self control.\n\nIf you want to hold players at fault for not realizing that they can and should mute others, then out of fairness you should also hold players at fault for losing their temper and harassing their teammates who annoy them.","replies":[]}]}
