Mata&#039;s MVP performance was commemorated by giving his Thresh skin a special animation; MaRin&#039;s MVP performance did not net him one? \r\n3. Bengi and Faker won their second World Championship; if such an astounding record isn&#039;t worth incorporating into their skins I really don&#039;t know why SSW skins had so much thought and effort put into their symbolism (rightly so) whereas SKT skins have literally none of the things mentioned above in way of symbolism/commemorative ideas. First time a team repeats the title and it doesn&#039;t get a single reference? It could be something as simple as having two rings on their models or a special interaction w/ the old SKT skins when faced against them. \r\n\r\nI am a little disappointed at how there was no inclusion of these special moments for the winning team of the most prestigious tournament we have for the game; made doubly disappointing b/c this is the second win for 2 players (first to repeat the title) and all of that gets sidelined. \r\n\r\nLastly, will the skins not have SKT logo/icons on them? Thanks for reading and sorry if the tone is rather disappointed and seems unappreciative. Just a fan who thinks more should have been done to commemorate what SKT achieved; not more than what SSW received but at least comparable. \r\n\r\nOh, I do absolutely like the art and overall theme of the skins and how they are designed for the RP they are available for; there is no question about that. I am really concerned about the way the commemorative aspect is severely lacking. Just another idea which came to mind: what if you increased the tier of skins if a team repeats the title? Instead of 720 RP, you released skins worth 975 RP. That is just an idea. Thanks.","replies":[]}
