Got an error \"unable to connect check your internet connection\" My connection is fine as I was on Discord with my team at the time and never disconnected. I was able to successfully play 3 games before i got this error. It wasn't until the game was ended on terms of a remake that the client allowed me to once again que up for a game. \r\n\r\nNext 5 games were fine, no errors or anything and was able to successfully complete them. Then all of a sudden the same error appears and I tried everything to reconnect !! Even went as far as to do a full repair !!  Every time I tried the client was making several sound effects like I was browsing through the shop or something during the black screen / loading screen before game.  Now I am unable to play with my friends since the low priority que makes me wait 20 minutes before every game !!! This is completely unfair and Unacceptable.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-24T23:53:54.903+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It kinda sounds like your connection was having some intermittent hiccups, which were causing problems but only every now and then for some reason. I'm wondering if something like a firewall/antivirus setting was kicking in randomly and trying to block your access to that specific game server. Update your [**firewall exceptions **](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664#wq3) and let me know if you see any differences. \n\nIf that doesn't seem to help, run a traceroute to 104.160.131.1 using [WinMTR](http://winmtr.net/winmtr-v0-92-now-available/) so I can see how your connection looks on it's way to our servers.","replies":[]}]}
