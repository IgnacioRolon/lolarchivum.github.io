Also, there would be spots in game like the jungle for example where my screen would just totally be covered in this black pixel-like thing. To be quite honest i don&#039;t really know how to describe this bug or whatever. i can see still see the health bar and names and all of that stuff tho. i tried running league on the lowest setting and the highest, but it seem to not work.  \r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/FU5UdN9.png \r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/IFl9lTc.png","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2017-06-26T16:36:23.367+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey xXIceFireXx! \n\nSeems totally intended. ;) Seriously, though, that's clearly less than ideal when you're trying to play. D: \n\nHave you tried performing a client repair?  If not, I'd suggest trying that first. Here's how'd you go about it: \n\n* Open the League of Legends Launcher.\n* Click the Gear button to open the Settings menu.\n* Click the \"Repair\" button. The repair process will take about 30-60 minutes.\n\nRegarding video cards, the minimum requirements for League would be a shader version 2.0 capable video card, but we recommend a Nvidia GeForce 8800/AMD Radeon HD 5670 or equivalent video card (Dedicated GPU with 512MB or higher Video Memory(VRAM)).

Try reinstalling the game. If that doesn't work, its probably your card.","replies":[]}]}
