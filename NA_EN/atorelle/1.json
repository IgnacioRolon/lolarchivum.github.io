Happens to the best of us.\r\nHowever, being bad, accidentally fucking the game somehow obviously sucks if your team has worked super hard, and you have also tried to make an effort (it shows) isn't a crime. I believe that everybody, ABSOLUTELY everybody has done something of the sort, unless someone comes up to me and says they've never singlehandedly/indirectly fucked a game for their teammates. I don't think even top tier players like TheShy, Faker has never fucked up once in their lives.\r\nWe all get tilted, if your teammate is playing bad and refusing to take the blame for throwing/being toxic/inting/afking, that's a different game. Some people I've came across are bad, but they make an effort, and they try their best and they listen. In those games, I never got tilted, and I were in situations where my teammate made a dumb mistakes and fricked the game, but at least they apologize for it. And honestly, making mistakes are human - however that's not an excuse to int.\r\n\r\nMaking mistakes are ok, and sometimes we do have to remember it's just a game. Not everything is on the stake here. Imagine pro players- this is literally their career, and they manage to keep their cool on stage (mostly). They actually have something on the line here. I'm not saying that you don't, because people do put time into this game - but sometimes we should look at ourselves than always flaming other people (when they weren't being toxic in the first place and did apologize). \r\n\r\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[{"poster":"Nightsky Pirate","date":"2019-12-12T05:21:45.481+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"That's true.

I'll go above and beyond tryhard to try and turn around a ranked game because it's ranked, and I care. But if I'm playing a normal game I will afk if two people are blocking a surrender vote and I'm not having fun anymore, because the whole reason I'm playing normals in the first place is to have fun. Ranked: I play to win, Normal: I play to have fun. Ranked: I'll play safer after I die. Normal: I'll keep diving the 10/0 garen because I want to. I guess it's more about limit testing in normals and once I found those limits and I can no longer win lane I don't want to play anymore.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KnightLakega","date":"2019-12-12T09:52:18.635+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":4,"body":"Most people rage in League have 100% perfect reason too....
