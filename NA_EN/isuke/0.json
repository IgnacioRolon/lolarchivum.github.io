Ofcourse this is only a suggestion and i have no idea how to go about making a movie (that would be riots job), but i think it would be a great idea for many reasons. It can bring more popularity to the game as well as earn riot a good amount of money for improvements ect. such as the NA server atm :P anyway i think itd be great to see what riot could come up with in making a movie. I mean the cinematic trailer was great. All they need to do is make a two hour version!Jk. Well, thats my suggestion.","replies":[{"poster":"IronStylus","date":"2014-02-23T08:32:33.068+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here's my take.. I think we need vignettes. Honestly, cramming that many characters into one or even a few movies would be damn near impossible. Not everyone knows each other. You might not even be able to make stuff work considering how large the world is. What might work is telling a story of a group of characters, maybe along faction lines, or geographical locations. Stories the revolve around the Piltover/Zaun relationship, Demacia/Noxus, or the whole of Mt Targon. These sort of regional stories might best serve a way to really explore the world without needed to basically have the Avengers X 50.","replies":[{"poster":"Ravenfeather","date":"2014-02-23T08:35:37.527+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please more of this.

I think there's a bunch of stuff being explored in terms of story delivery. Everything from the Jinx video, to the Lucian login, to the Vel'koz promo is proof of things coming out of experimentation and into implementation. I think our ways to deliver story will only grow from here :)","replies":[{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2014-02-23T17:59:50.137+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just want actual stories back. The jinx log in is great, but I didn't get anything from it other than 'Jinx is crazy, is good at machines, and likes explosions.' Why does Sivir have something against Cass?

It was implied in the Talon teaser image. You can see Swain's bird and some black roses, referencing \"The Black Rose\", they assassinated him. That is why Talon joined the League. To follow Swain and LeBlanc.\n\nAnd The Void is technically another world, so there are several champs from there. Nasus and Renekton are from some desert world (un-named).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ravenfeather","date":"2014-02-24T09:16:29.992+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The Runeterra retcon I saw as a sad necessity. Having characters from a hundred different worlds is nice, but when you have everyone from one continent with a few out-lying champions, then you can better develop the regions those people come from.

Not every story and lore piece can be feature length and vignettes can be pumped out in more a more timely fashion.\n\nBut who knows? Maybe play certain vignettes in order and you might just get a LoL movie out it (*maybe an awkwardly spliced one with some scenes missing, but it could work*).\n\nAlso when I think League vignettes, I'm reminded of those Heritage Minutes growing up and it's putting a big smile on my face thinking about it more.","replies":[{"poster":"Isuke","date":"2014-02-23T20:00:09.536+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well vignetes wouldnt do the trick in attracting popularity or raising money","replies":[{"poster":"CapNJacket","date":"2014-02-23T21:55:36.090+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe not in the numbers you're thinking of like at the box office, but maybe they can lead up to that.\n\nI think in my first post I said there could be a lot to take out of context with a League movie straight out of the gate. Maybe the vignettes can help? Draw enough interest with vignettes, make sure there enough people interested in the lore and the world, then crank the production to 11 for the big budget blockbuster.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Isuke","date":"2014-02-23T15:47:14.420+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe something like demacian justice against the threat from the void or something?

Just maybe a lot to take out of context for the general public.\n\nIf LoL were to make a movie, my best guess for a first outing world be that it's a world building high fantasy with Noxus vs. Demacia/Noxus vs. Ionia. Problem I see with this is that it would only cover a *small faction* or League's setting and charm.\n\nOnly real remedy to that would be to make League of Legends ***movies*** (*As if one League movie wasn't daunting enough* :S).\nPersonally, I think maybe a buddy cop movie with Vi and Cait could be fun. Also the Freljord conflict filmed in the style of Romance of the Three Kingdoms or Game of Thrones might work.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kaine","date":"2014-02-23T07:19:43.026+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I don't want a movie.
