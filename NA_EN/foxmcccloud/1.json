I was mad; but what Bronze player isn't? I fought and carried my way out of Bronze and learned how to properly play the game. It took me the entire season, but I emerged a stronger more knowledgeable player ending the Season in Silver II.\r\n\r\nSeason 4 comes around, I really mess up my provisionals and end up in Bronze II. I was still mad because I felt like being back in Bronze would slow down my growth as a player. I got bummed out in the middle of the season and towards the end of the Season I ended in Silver IV.\r\n\r\nSeason 5 comes around and I got 8/2 in my provisionals and I'm put in Bronze IV. Now I'm not mad about it. Kind of tired of it, but I know I'll climb. I'm winning 80% of all my matches and sitting at Bronze I currently so it won't be much longer.\r\n\r\nBut here's my real issue with Bronze; they are always reporting random people for no reason all the time just because they lost. I'm constantly getting reported when I all do is play. Here's just 1 example of a match where the enemy Soraka flat out tells me I'm getting reported just because I won't report Mordekaiser because I outplayed him in lane. I'm worried that with the new changes to the system I might end up in low priority. I've been playing for 3 years and all I've wanted is to be a part of a serious 5 man team, but if I'm in low priority with 20 minute queues it will take forever for me to get to a higher elo where I can finally gather enough people. But it seems like every game I get a pop up that says I have been reported for things I never did. With the Tribunal System down it's really starting to make me not want to play the game for fear of being banned just for being low elo.","replies":[{"poster":"FedAsFuk","date":"2015-03-01T00:34:37.534+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"The chat logs are considered in all reports, you should receive no penalties for bogus reports.

So I had to play support on top lane with a Kha'zix. They also said a mouth full of \"nice\" words, while all I said was \"Sorry, didn't see anyone call this lane, I'll just go top with Kha\". (also note, only one of them called Bot, not both, nor did they mention they were bot laning together). \nIf I were time banned for that, something is wrong with Riot. I don't think you have much to worry about. People send false reports all the time, I'm pretty sure Riot knows what they are doing at this point in time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mathlete864","date":"2015-03-01T23:01:08.639+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I get reported all the time from salty enemy players :P nothing you can do about it","replies":[]},{"poster":"Leti the Yeti","date":"2015-03-01T00:54:51.530+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you should never be worried about being reported\nreports dont DOOOOO anything, ever\nwell maybe EVENTUALLY it will do something\nbut not until i trolled the fuck out of atleast 100 people","replies":[]}]}
