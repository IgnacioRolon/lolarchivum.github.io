No, this isn&#039;t one of those threads. \r\n\r\nI&#039;ve begun noticing a problem that I think has been happening for a long time. After every single match of League of Legends I just feel exhausted. Like physically tired like I need to take a nap. It happens after every single match. When I hop into another match I no longer feel tired. I was just curious if this is a normal thing and if there are things I can do to eliminate this as I try to improve and climb the ladder? \r\n\r\nI currently get ~9hours of sleep each day and it even occurs during the first few matches each day. Also League of Legends is the only game that causes this effect. I can play Bloodborne for 13 hours and quit without feeling tired. Samething with CSGO.","replies":[{"poster":"NorthernDruid","date":"2015-04-03T23:31:16.200+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Make sure you get the right amount of sleep (not too much, not too little).\n\nSometimes, getting too much sleep can make you fatigued.\n\nAt least that happens to me if I sleep for more than up to 8 hours.\n\nIn my experience, getting too little sleep makes my brain tired, but getting too much makes my body tired.\n\nLike it won't wake up from hibernation or something.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hasztalan2","date":"2015-04-03T06:15:59.238+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ya i'm also on the side thinking you stress 2 much ingame. Mute everything and everyone and focus on ur own game. It is also the best way to improve yourself.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nefarious Yordle","date":"2015-04-03T00:44:43.597+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can probably gain some useful insights by noting your energy consumption during a game. You might spend too much or too little energy on a game. You might also feel too excited or too bored to be able to stay energized throughout your games. When you find anything out of order, that would be the first thing you should try to fix and see if that also solves the problem. When you can't find anything, you might be forced to simply wait it out and see if anything changes after a while. Simply the flow of time might give you useful insights, for instance when you'd find yourself not having this effect when playing URF mode.\n\nBest of luck!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gym Leader Yaki","date":"2015-04-02T18:40:54.775+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe you spend too much energy on the game. Like you get too excited, plan too much ahead, stay too energetic throughout the game.\nMay I suggest listening to music during your games? Like something soothing and calm (that must keep you energetic and into the game nonetheless).\n\nAlso, try not picking assassins or those high risk, high reward type of champs. Go for those simple, more stable/balanced champs.\n\nGood luck :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2015-04-02T18:11:10.553+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same\n\nJust gotta queue back up, or find something else to do\n\nThe worst thing that can happen is you just open up another tab, and find yourself constantly asking \"Should I start up another game?\" \n\nIts weird asfq, but you gotta treck on!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hasztalan2","date":"2015-04-02T08:45:44.857+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your camera settings (locked unlocked ,zoom level etc) fps and resolution pls.","replies":[{"poster":"foxmcccloud","date":"2015-04-02T09:36:07.358+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unlocked, zoomed all the way out, ~150-230 FPS, 1600X900 Resolution","replies":[]}]}]}
