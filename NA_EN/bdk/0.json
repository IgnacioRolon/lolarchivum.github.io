So then I repaired using hextech tool and it still does not work.. I can login to the  league of legends website on my web browser just fine using the same credentials. Does anyone know what is wrong?\n\nEdit: I have also tried to reset my password and I still could not login.","replies":[{"poster":"Hidden Box Jutsu","date":"2017-05-25T06:49:54.642+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I made a post on this issue a few days ago and I was told to look at their help page.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sainte Gorge","date":"2017-05-24T20:35:40.979+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am having this exact same issue too ! ! ! ! !","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-24T20:33:52.299+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We currently have a [sticky ](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/Oe3XBf34-incorrect-username-or-password)about this up, but the issue seems to stem from being on the wrong patch.  Instead of running a repair, I suggest doing a Force Repatch instead to make sure you get to the most recent version.  I also recommend a manual adjustment to help prevent this mismatch again:\n\nLocate LeagueClientSettings.yaml within C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\nOpen it with a text editor (such as Notepad, TextEdit, or Notepad++) and find gameflow-patcher-lock. It should have a number there.\nChange the number to read \"null\" (without quotes)\nSave the file.\nRestart the client.\n\nHope it helps!","replies":[]},{"poster":"AK Sir Artorias","date":"2017-05-24T18:57:55.625+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am having this exact same issue.
