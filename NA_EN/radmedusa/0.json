And the answer to this is clearly \"LESS\", and **not** \"NOTHING\". The system is designed to prevent you from exploiting it, not to punish you and make you earn less Honor if you play in a Premade.\n\nSo let's make all this very simple: **Don't care about how the system is coded, and Honor your premade IF AND WHEN they deserve it, and it'll work.** Now, you can not believe me and never honor your premade at all.

I don't like though how they say everyone benefits if everyone honors. \"A whole team gets a slight bonus to their honor level if every teammate votes. Just like the game, you win or lose as a team.\" Because it makes u honor every game 'to game the system' even though there will be games (especially in this community) where honoring someone just to get that team honor bonus will make u feel bad :P. like when ur the odd man out in a 4 man premade.
