And for three seasons we grew as a people without structure, only a loose affiliation with the other tribes of GDers.\n\nOne Legend of these most ancient times is that of the First Tribe of GD, a story lost for some time to dust and destiny in the wake of churning chaos. A most courageous band of nomadic, honorable warriors, the First Tribe invented the concept of democracy and instituted the first foundations of society, bending small pockets of the forum land to fit their needs and will with new and advanced agricultural technologies. An industrious clan, they held a contest to one day determine a champion of champions for themselves and the majestic Renekton Bot claimed the honor for himself. His great deeds and accomplishments are widely known, and today, are the stuff of legends that we tell our children so that our children will tell their children the same stories with the same awe in due time.\n\nThen, in season 4, the hands of fate delivered us a unifier, a leader, and we were blessed at first by the rise of Rackier. As he consolidated the power of all the tribes GD ceased to be a loosely affiliated band of cultures and peoples and instead we became one Nation, a house no longer divided. His reign as Grand Overlord was the first instance of an overseer of all GD, and a tradition followed ever since.\n\nBut the reign of Rackier was not a peaceful one, nor was the newly established government a democracy. It was a dictatorship, an authoritarian regime that brutally oppressed millions of bronzies for the sake of cheap field labor hands. Unappeased by the quality of life for the average GDer a group of radicals formed a rebellion and Rackier was overthrown, his powers of state restricted and positions of power occupied by cronies and lackies emptied. A constitution was written and a democratic government established. Rackier may have brought us all together, but the revolution determined the shape of our future society.\n\nAnd so, with season 5 approaching, for the first time ever, a unified GD held an official election to empower an overseer and protector. The list of nominations was long and distinguished while including heroes of the rebellion and the days of old before the unification, members of Rackier&#039;s ousted cabal (and Rackier himself) and even what many had assumed were only gods of myth and GD legend. The nominees made their speeches and promised us bold futures and the people of GD cast their ballots. When all the votes were tallied we had another first. Our very first election resulted in not one, but a pair of commander and chiefs. GD cheered for its original, elected, co Grand Overlords, KiteAzure and Rackier.\n\nWith Rackier&#039;s more ruthless tendencies offset by the checks and balances of power the more compassionate KiteAzure controlled, GD entered a new golden age and began The Great Work of crafting our youthful nation a new and better home. We had grown to big for our ancestral forums homeland and the nation required more territory to expand into.\n\nThe Boards was the answer, a vast, verdant wilderness beyond the land of the forums out stretching in every direction to distant ocean shores. The Great Transition began as The Great Work was completed and the land of The Boards made habitable and safe for the people of our great nation. But sadly, the forced exodus from our ravaged and depleted ancestral home took its toll on the leadership of the fledgling nation&#039;s government. KiteAzure, afraid the wilderness of The Boards would ultimately be the doom of the people of the nation traveled to the distant island of Kite&#039;s GD to set up his sanctuary in seclusion. Rackier, grown bored and restless of the lack of challenge for his warriors skills traveled, alone, to the middle Earth in pursuit of a worthy opponent to test his prowess. Their terms of service as heads of the government cut short by resignation, the nation of GD reeled in the aftermath.\n\nWe were lucky though, and blessed again by fate. A leader rose up from the turmoil and chose to shoulder the burden of responsibility of leading the people&#039;s of the nation. A humble servant who only wished to improve the lives of his fellow GDer&#039;s, the one we all know today as Macilento. A new era of social and economic growth began as taxes were revamped and balanced, a single currency replaced the confusing barter exchange system, and a plethora of fruits, vegetables, and food stuffs from the outer edges of The Boards wilderness flooded the capital of our maturing nation. Quality of life for all GDer&#039;s increased by orders of magnitude. Art, sport, science, and tolerance reach all time and unprecedented highs. The golden age climaxes.\n\nWeary of the labors of love for his term, Macilento has stepped down from his official capacity as President of GD and for the last few months we have been without a true Captain at the Helm. And we, the peoples of the great nation of GD face new challenges moving forward. I ask you now, citizens of this Great Board Land, shall we elect a new official to oversee our journey of destiny for this coming season 7?\n\nAnd if so what type of individual should we elect?\n\nShould we begin a new nomination process?\n\nOr is our nation stable enough that we believe it can operate sans a President for the time being?","replies":[]}
