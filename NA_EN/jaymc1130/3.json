The case of_ &ldquo;Unusual Pick that Throws A Game on Its head&rdquo;_ vs _&ldquo;The Teammates going WTF Is Going On&rdquo;_.\n&gt; \n&gt; [If you&rsquo;re just tuning in we previously covered this topic with a similar case in December: &ldquo;Support Singed isn&#x27;t bannable, but that&#x27;s not the point&rdquo;. ](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/79aGu3wR-support-singed-isnt-banable-but-thats-not-the-point?comment=006b) \n&gt; \n&gt; We feel that the situation between these two edge cases are very similar. But it&rsquo;s obvious we need to keep updating a few processes to smooth out any rare repeats in the future. And rare is what we&rsquo;d call this; it&rsquo;s a very unique edge case that seems to only present itself once every few months among thousands of audits that we process. \n&gt; \n&gt; Let&rsquo;s re-iterate our stance from before:\n&gt; \n&gt; **Q: Can I get banned for choosing a champion or strategy that is outside the current meta?**\n&gt; \n&gt; A: 100% no. Choosing a champion or strategy outside of the current meta is not a factor we take into account when reviewing accounts. On any given day tens of thousands of players are making unusual picks in the game and they&rsquo;ll never receive penalties in any form.  \n&gt; \n&gt; **Q:  So why does this issue keep coming up?  What makes it different?**\n&gt; \n&gt; A: Riot Gromp said it best in the previous post when they stated: &ldquo;...common sense and good sportsmanship say that experimenting players need to clearly communicate intent and win conditions to their teammates.&rdquo; League of Legends is a team game and sometimes the biggest challenge can be coordinating with 4 other strangers who share a common goal; victory. If a player is going to rewrite the rules for the rest of their team then there is more pressure to properly communicate to everyone what they want the plan to be, and what they think everyone should do to achieve it.\n&gt; \n&gt; But wait! Communication doesn&rsquo;t stop after you press the Enter button on your keyboard; and that&rsquo;s where we saw a problem in this particular case. All of us need to be aware of the difference of communicating &ldquo;with&rdquo; someone vs. communicating &ldquo;at&rdquo; someone. _Telling your team what you&rsquo;re going to do and then ignoring them isn&rsquo;t really working with them it&rsquo;s holding them hostage_. Telling your team what you want to do and actually working towards a common plan is a central part to playing any team based game.\n&gt; \n&gt; In this case what we observed was an expert Nunu counter-jungler throwing the meta on it&rsquo;s head with a respectable win rate of 53%. While pretty impressive on it&rsquo;s own, we also found that nearly 50% of their games were reported by teammates as frustrating and unfun. Keep in mind, this isn&rsquo;t just teammates in losing games, this is teammates across all of his games; victories included.  \n&gt; \n&gt; The message was pretty clear to us, this player is serious about_ Making Nunu Great Again_ but they are leaving a trail of dissatisfaction, frustration, and anger in their wake.\n&gt; \n&gt; Winning is not the end all be all of League. We want players to have fun but not at the expense of teammates. Ideally this means players will coordinate among themselves in a given match and react to the unique circumstances they end up in. If a player is consistently forcing &ldquo;their vision&rdquo; on the rest of the team **and **refusing to adapt to their needs we reserve the right to intervene. That&rsquo;s what happened here (and before with the Singed case); players cried out how terrible the experience was for them and we intervened.\n&gt; \n&gt; Moving forward we&rsquo;re going to keep updating our processes for these edge cases. We will still be on the lookout for situations where a player is creating a really negative experience for everyone else and we will intervene when necessary.  In this case it&rsquo;s undeniable that TakeTheDraw wants to win even if their approach leaves a lot to be desired.  The effects on others in his games were enough for us to lock the account and we stand by that.  But our agents were not properly prepared with a process to handle this edge case when they wrote in and that is on me.  I will be working with the team to clarify an escalation process that emphasizes clearer feedback and opens the door for ban reductions if we believe that someone can make changes to their play style allowing them to continue crushing the meta but not at the expense of their teammates.\n\nAre you folks aware of just how awful a precedent you have set with this ruling?\n\nYou banned one player, ONE, for essentially &quot;failing to communicate effectively&quot; in lobby about what his game plan is....\n\nAnd yet you continue to institute systems (really bad ones, by the way) like role selection that harm the health of the game (by requiring things like auto fill) and encourage players to forego communication about strategy and picks in lobby?\n\nAnd this is on top of practically EVERY LOVBY FROM BRONZE 5 TO CHALLENGER containing multiple players who &quot;fail to communicate effectively&quot;? None of whom have been banned for &quot;breaking&quot; the same rule as what you banned that nunu player for?\n\nYou literally singled out one player (who was succeeding with his strategy, so obviously his in game communication must be pretty good to adjust to his teams on the fly with an unusual approach) when millions upon millions violate that same rule daily and nothing is done to them.\n\nThis is the absolute height of hypocrisy and it&#039;s complete and utter bullshit. I&#039;ve done the exact same strategy as him (usually with a different champion pick) and never been banned for it (or even reported as far as I know). How the hell os that fair? How is it right?\n\nFirst of all you need to immediately undo his ban and issue a PUBLIC statement of apology to him.\n\nSecondly, if you want to set the precedent that communication in lobby is of paramount importance and a must for ever game and every player then you need to stop introducing systems and concepts like role selection that discourage players from communicating (or even learning HOW to do so properly in lobby) and remove them because they create an unhealthy gaming environment.\n\nShame on you riot, I&#039;ve always considered you a shortsighted and unethical company (when your CEO pays and gives an account to a permabanned professional player to boost him that&#039;s just a really shabby and pathetic look mark merrill), but this absolutely takes the cake.\n\nYou could not possibly have screwed this decision up in a worse way. Particularly since it&#039;s your poorly designed systems that discourage players from using and learning basic game play fundamentals in the first place.\n\nBad job.\n\nYou did bad and you should feel bad.\n\nShame on you.","replies":[{"poster":"Lauchmelder","date":"2017-02-28T10:20:29.332+0000","up_votes":120,"down_votes":10,"body":"WookieeCookie had a completely pointless argument.

Regardless of the outcome, you can guarantee very few of the higher tier players in his matches were accepting of his strategy, they want to win, badly. Of course they're going to be upset if they don't and they'll look straight to him. On the other hand, when they win, they're going to look back at how they could have done better. Obviously, it was all support nunu's fault that they missed 10 CS, didn't get that double kill, etc. So, the only solution for them(unfortunately for the player who is clearly decent, 53% win rate with the trolliest thing I've ever seen) is to report him for ruining their gameplay experience, which is perfectly acceptable. This guy shouldn't have gotten banned, before getting a warning, imo, but thats not my place to decide. \n\nOnce again, he wasn't banned for an off meta pick. He was banned because he'd CTRL+C His statement of intent regarding Nunu in bottom lane, and then he'd suggest who the ADC should pick. He would then not speak, (its probably best if he doesn't argue with the others) and proceed to lock in as the Nunu with smite, regardless of protests.

It's a basic skill we had to learn in early seasons and it was tough then. Now players aren't even afforded an opportunity to learn how to communicate in lobby because role selection makes them feel entitled to a role which makes players think they have nothing to discuss.

He exactly mentioned this. \n- Since when do you play LoL? Before roleselect we had to fight over our roles, Every.Single.Time!

It is not easy and surely will take time if you arent in proplay but it is possible.\n\nAlso, the meta is the commonly known basic strategy, everybody has at least an idea of the general game plan.\nIf 2 offmeta strategys compete against each other but they fail to come to an agreement, then the meta strategy will be played instead.\nThe meta is the fallback.\nThe same applies when an offmeta strategy competes against the meta strategy! If they all agree then the offmeta will be played, but if not then the meta strategy sould be played!\n**BUT** you should always at least give the offmeta strategy a thought! This obviously doesnt obligate you to side with the offmeta strategy. But you dont want to test out new stuff that could backfire when you are in your 8th promo to gold for example.
