Best Attribute Bonanza.","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] General Discussion","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"Game Rules:\r\n\r\nPost the Attribute and GDer you think best represents it. For example: The GDer with the best Wit is 2ndChance. Or: The GDer with the best Smile is Tundra Fizz. Or: The GDer with the best Cosplay is Miss Wake n Bake.\r\n\r\nYou are only allowed to submit ONE attribute/GDer combination. You may comment as much as you like upon other submissions, or try to sway opinion with your appreciation for any given submission.\r\n\r\nThe submission with the most upvotes on Midnight 1-10-2017 wins. The one with the most downvotes loses. Everyone else gets a participation ribbon.\r\n\r\nYou may upvote a post or downvote a post for whatever reason you so desire at your own discretion. You may also use smurfs at your own discretion to up or downvote (since I can&#039;t exactly stop you), but I would ask that people not go overboard on it (it ruins the fun, and this is supposed to be for fun and laughs).\r\n\r\nI will make the first submission as the first comment in this thread so that it may be properly voted upon.","replies":[]}
