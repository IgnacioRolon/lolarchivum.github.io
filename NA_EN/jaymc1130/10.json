Round 2.","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] General Discussion","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Game Rules:\r\n\r\nPost the Attribute and League Champion you think best represents it. For example: The Champion with the Biggest Sword is Riven. Or: The Champion with the best Fangs is Rengar. Or: The Champion with the best Swimsuit is Leona.\r\n\r\nYou are only allowed to submit ONE Attribute/Champion combination. You may comment as much as you like upon other submissions, or try to sway opinion with your appreciation for any given submission.\r\n\r\nNo smurf submissions will be accepted.\r\n\r\nThe submission with the most upvotes on Midnight 1-13-2017 wins. The one with the most downvotes loses. Everyone else gets a participation ribbon.\r\n\r\nYou may upvote a post or downvote a post for whatever reason you so desire at your own discretion. You may also use smurfs at your own discretion to up or downvote (since I can&#039;t exactly stop you), but I would ask that people not go overboard on it (it ruins the fun, and this is supposed to be for fun and laughs).\r\n\r\nI will make the first submission as the first comment in this thread so that it may be properly voted upon.","replies":[]}
