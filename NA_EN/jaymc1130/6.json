One thing I don&#039;t think we will do again is the Attribute/GDer combination. I felt like it would be too easy to use the game as a sniping platform to antagonize and the purpose of the game is to have some fun and be creative and imaginative and then be appreciated for making an original point.\n\nKind of like how Around the Horn works on ESPN, except instead of just the Host arbitrarily granting points or mutes, everyone gets to.\n\nNothing truly nasty happened in our first go round, but I see potential for it and as such all future rounds of Best Attribute Bonanza will use a more mundane combination like Attribute/Champion, or Attribute/Movie. I expect those with an extensive knowledge of pop culture will be quite good at the game, and there are a million Things we can describe with an Attribute, so the game should always stay somewhat fresh because the topics will always be slightly different.\n\nIt&#039;s now GD&#039;s version of a  game of competitive banter. Let&#039;s get to the game stats.\n\n**Game Stats**\n\nGame: http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/GD/ANw3Eg84-lets-play-a-game-gd-best-attribute-bonanza\n\nCompetitor : Score (Career) / Upvotes (Career) / Downvotes (Career) / Win (Career) / Loss (Career) / Played (Career)\n\nVirginRivenMain: 1 / 3 / 2 / 0 / 0 / 1 (same, inaugural game)\n\nChickenWrap: 7 / 8 / 1 / 0 / 0 / 1 (same, inaugural game)\n\nMissWakenBake: 2 / 3 / 1 / 0 / 0 / 1 (same, inaugural game)\n\nTrolosaurus: -2 / 1 / 3 / 0 / 0 / 1 (same, inaugural game)\n\nKriske: 0 / 1 / 1 / 0 / 0 / 1 (same, inaugural game)\n\nDestaice: 0 / 2 / 2 / 0 / 0 / 1 (same, inaugural game)\n\nnm1010: 12 / 14 / 2 / 1 / 0 / 1 (same, inaugural game)\n\nRockman: 9 / 10 / 1 / 0 / 0 / 1 (same, inaugural game)\n\nGlobDaBlob: -4 / 2 / 6 / 0 / 1 / 1 (same, inaugural game)\n\nBlueVestGuy: -2 / 1 / 3 / 0 / 0 / 1 (same, inaugural game)\n\nLatitoast: 6 / 7 / 1 / 0 / 0 / 1 (same, inaugural game)\n\nPartyPanda12: -1 / 1 / 2 / 0 / 0 / 1 (same, inaugural game)\n\nBesteau: 1 / 2 / 1 / 0 / 0 / 1 (same, inaugural game)\n\nBurger and Fries: 5 / 5 / 0 / 0 / 0 / 1 (same, inaugural game)\n\nBustyDemoness: 0 / 4 / 4 / 0 / 0 / 1 (same, inaugural game)\n\nPurple Ayane: 1 / 1 / 0 / 0 / 0 / 1 (same, inaugural game)\n\nHappy Honker: 2 / 2 / 0 / 0 / 0 / 1 (same, inaugural game)\n\nDragontroopbeta: 2 / 2 / 0 / 0 / 0 / 1 (same, inaugural game)\n\nCTElephant: 1 / 1 / 0 / 0 / 0 / 1 (same, inaugural game)\n\n**Game Awards**\n\nChampion: nm1010 (an award given to the winner, career wins record holder is Champion of Champions)\n\nVanquished: GlobDaBlob (an award given to the loser, career losses record holder is Most Vanquished)\n\nTop Competitor: Latitoast (a career award for the most games played.
