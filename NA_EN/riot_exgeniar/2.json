The second one is a close second.\n\n1. Karthus R\nI wouldn't be the first person to want the frames on this stripped completely to avoid any possible chance of lag, while keeping this ancient ability in MOBA/LoL. Practically invisible with lux laser type line pls\n\n2. Placing a ward myself.\nJumping to it has nothing to do with it. The problem is placing the ward is instant. The recovery time is enormous and random. The PROOF is in the ward jump. Go make a custom and ward jump 100 times. Despite anything, they are all different delays, even though I know you can face smash them instantly together. A macro would probably have inconsistent results.\n\n3. Ping\nPlaying any of these champions at higher then normal ping furthers the issue of being able to place the ward. Interestingly, the ward hop fails to be as fast, again, but has higher results on performance. The shunpo follows the ward placement faster with less recovery between the two events at high ping.\n\nIf you could place a ward, at low ping, with no recovery, I would be consistently be ward hoping in the middle of teamfights, over peoples heads, dodging ultimate abilities and more of the ways flash can be used. \"Recovery\" however is nearly a suicide feature to the point that:\nYes, I bet it crashes games.\n\ntl;dr \nGG it's the wards. Everyone wards. Wards = gamecrash, if you see someone ever place a ward, kat or not, attack them duh. they're frozen.\n\nmy advice would be to remove ward placement from autofacing the champion the direction the ward is placed. second, if possible remove the 'swoosh'.\n\nThis only shows where a ward was placed.
