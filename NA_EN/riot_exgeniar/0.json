So, overall, the cursor doesn't affect Swipe's direction. The skill is just affected by where Nidalee is facing at.\n\nPlease check if this is a general bug (which I'm pretty sure it is, as I tested it) and fix this as soon as possible (And maybe go for loss prevented in the games already played as it really affects the whole Nidalee gameplay).","replies":[{"poster":"LtSerge","date":"2014-10-11T16:41:03.708+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"Day 3, bugg still here...
