These changes might have something to do with it?\n\n\n4.17\nType of Bug: Patcher crashes\n\nSummary of the Bug: I was in the middle of a game, playing{{champion:236}} There also was a teammate{{champion:112}} and an enemy {{champion:16}}  when I got a bugsplat error. It had happened twice. One time, able to reload and continue playing, the second time, completely froze. Thats when the patcher started crashing. I have no clue whether these two problems are related, but I have never got a bugsplat error in the 3 years I have been playing.\n\nReproduction Steps: Run the patcher, as soon as it pops up, I get a notification saying: update failed, with a \"continue\" button and \"send logs\". Then try pressing launch, disappearing like normal but nothing happens. Im not even able to play a game to see if I get more bugsplats or errors let alone login\n\nReproduction Rate: 100%, I even tried the repair tool and watched it. Everything seems normal except that notification saying I get update failed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Blaze Bakun","date":"2014-09-25T19:19:32.486+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Type of Bug: Gameplay\nSummary of the Bug: Celestine Soraka's hair moves awkward when she walks\nReproduction Steps: Start a game with Soraka using her Celestine skin and order her to move.\nReproduction Rate: (It happens all the time since that is her walking animation)\nServer: LAN\n\nI suppose it's an error, since her hair doesn't move like that in her base, Dryad or Divine skins, and it didn't use to move like that (plus it defies physics).\nIt isn't exactly a priority issue, though, but it gets on my nerves and keeps me from using my favorite skin :c","replies":[{"poster":"Blaze Bakun","date":"2014-09-26T06:04:34.065+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also, she doesn't disappear when dead.\n\nType of Bug: Gameplay\nSummary of the Bug: Celestine Soraka's body stays on the ground after death\nReproduction Steps: Start a game with Soraka using her Celestine skin and die.\nReproduction Rate: (It happens all the time since that is her death animation)\nServer: LAN","replies":[{"poster":"Calimdir","date":"2014-09-28T00:41:26.111+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Correct me if I'm a wrong, but don't all champs leave their corpse on the ground until they respawn?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"SammichLord","date":"2014-09-26T03:02:59.745+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"type of bug: gameplay\n\nSummary of bug: I'm not sure if it is a bug or something to be concerned about, but i just played two games in a row with people that all had ghost and heal and just kept running around just basic attacking with the rare ability like trained bots.\n Also i'm pretty sure this wasn't just the same team trolling us 2 times because we had someone on our team doing the same thing.... it is really creepy and I don't have any idea what the heck just happened.\n\nserver: NA","replies":[{"poster":"Mistress Madoka","date":"2014-09-27T18:06:53.228+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Welcome to Soloqueue, Where everything is made up, and the Points don't matter","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"VirtualPlay","date":"2014-09-26T19:28:08.541+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Type of Bug: Crash\nSummary of Bug: Frequent bugsplats, possibly connected to Soraka.\nServer: NA\nMore details: I can't say for certain whether or not it's really related to Soraka, but I think I've gotten bugsplatted in almost, if not every game I play Soraka, but never in games she's not played.
