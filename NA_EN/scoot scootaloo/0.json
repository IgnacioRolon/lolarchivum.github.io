Everything was going good until Urf this weekend and now every game I play my PC lags so bad I get 5 fps in game.\r\nWhat's worst, my loading screen takes a lot of time, it not only annoys me but the people I play with, I'd say around 5 minutes it takes to get my champion to load 100%.\r\nI keep on testing on bots but nothing works.\r\nI can't play like this now and I'm not sure if it was for the new patch.\r\nAny help would be very appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-29T17:21:26.993+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You may be having some driver or third party issues, which can cause issues with FPS and a slow-down in rendering the game.
