Thing is, my ping is at all times 80-90, at max. 130, even when I'm downloading stuff the game doesn't turn this unresponsive. I can't do such a simple task as ulting in a middle of a fight with trynd, as doesnt activate, not mattering how many times I click it, and when i e'd towards dragon, it responded 2 secs later, diving me back to the fight i was escaping from. All game this horrible lag was on and I couldn't even freakin move barely on lane, so I decided to afk instead of feeding hard, which ended happening due to the crappy ults I threw. Hope someone can help me fix this, pls.","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-05-10T00:24:13.408+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Given the Login error as well as the ability delays in-game, this all seems to point to a type of connection issue between your computer and the League of Legends servers.

The game has crashed in my one Ranked game in a week at least 15-20 times due to server error and I cannot play at all!  If this is on Riot's end (it came with no warning, no prior problems), I really really need loss prevented for me and my teammates!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Woook3r","date":"2016-05-10T02:23:43.847+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if anyone cares, I was having low framrate issues and small ping spikes about 2 hrs ago.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"FireStorm21","date":"2016-05-10T01:16:30.675+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had same problem where i continuously get a message about failing to connect to server every game i play. somethings broke on ritos end.","replies":[]}]}
