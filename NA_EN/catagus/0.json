{"poster":"Catagus","date":"2017-03-08T04:09:42.006+0000","title":"Trolls and Negative Players: An immediate Solution (VOTE NOW)","subforum":"Player Behavior","up_votes":1,"down_votes":8,"body":"As we all know negative players damage the gaming experience when playing any game, especially games like League of Legends where having a co-operative team is crucial to having a fun and positive experience regardless of winning or losing. I&#039;m sure we can all relate winning is great, but speaking for myself I&#039;ve had fun in games where a loss happens just because the team was positive and tried to win together. Regardless of the score at the end of the match. \n\nIn regards to negative players the Tribunal system works, however it is &quot;after the fact.&quot; \nOnly after a negative player in other words a &quot;troll,&quot; someone who takes joy in harassing other players, and &quot;throwing&quot; games on purpose has done so a number of times, and has been reported, will they be punished for it. Not to mention this issue becomes worse when people have multiple accounts, some of which they use to throw games for fun. The Tribunal system does not seem to work very effectively for people with multiple accounts, if one account is punished the user can simply login to another account and continue to harass players and lose games on purpose, and repeat this process indefinitely. \n\nAlthough the Tribunal system has improved the gaming environment it does not provide immediate relief, for example; Players that are in a match with a negative player must play the entire match until it&#039;s over, wasting their time and creating a snowball affect of negativity. I&#039;m certain each and every one of us feels a bit upset when playing LoL when stuck in a game with a negative player, even after the match is over. \n\nThere should be a method to forfeit the match and cause just the negative player to receive the loss similar to the Remake Match option when a player fails to connect to the game. This method would allow a teammate to initiate a &quot;kick player vote,&quot; the team would then vote on whether the negative player should take the loss, and the match be forfeited. Along with the negative player receiving a short ban from joining any new games (for a few minutes).\n\nBy having the above described option, it prevents &quot;trolls&quot; from having fun at the expense of other players. \nBelow is a list of key points that would occur if such an option existed:\n\n--- Immediate punishment for the negative player (a lost match, with a time limit which prevents the player from joining a new game right away)\n--- All players  would refrain from being overly negative/harassing others know that the team could &quot;kick&quot; them for bad behavior\n--- The rest of the team does not have to suffer being stuck in an inevitably lost match with the negative player\n--- There would be a reduction in the usage of multiple accounts by negative players to throw games for fun. The match cannot be &quot;trolled&quot; if the match is forfeited by the team and just that negative player takes the loss along with not being allowed to join any new games for a few minutes.\n--- A reason which promotes negative players improve their behavior immediately\n---Immediate relief from negative players, keeping the gaming environment fun \n\nThere is an issue that could arise from the above system being implemented, which is players could &quot;kick&quot; other players just to prevent a loss for themselves at the expense of one player (who may not have been negative). This possible issue can be prevented: by only allowing players to have the ability to start a &quot;kick player vote&quot; once per week. So players would save their ability to initiate a &quot;kick player vote&quot; for matches which actually have negative players, that the team does not want to continue playing with. \n\nIf you believe this idea has some merit please comment and share this page with your friends. I believe that the League of Legends community is a positive one, it is obvious that the game developers, and moderators do care and are constantly trying to improve the game. If we get this thread popular and have it noticed by the moderators, and developers we can make a positive difference and implement something along the lines above. Making League of Legends a more positive gaming environment for everyone!\n\nThanks so much for your time and have fun out there in the field!\n\nSincerely,  \nCatagus\n\n*************UPDATE************\n\nI really appreciate all the responses, especially criticisms because it allows for improvement of the idea. \nAs many members from the community have pointed out the biggest concern with the above suggestion is the fact that it could be used maliciously example:\n\n- Kicking players for having a bad game\n- Kicking a single player to allow the other 4 to avoid the loss\n- Premade players trolling Solo Players\n\nNow that the flaws are well known what possible solutions/modifications could be done to improve the idea? Also I would like to point out this idea is not for rude players, more so for players trolling games for fun causing the rest of the team to be stuck in that losing game for 20 minutes. As always all responses are appreciated, especially constructive criticism that has the potential for improving the idea. If we are able to address the above flaws thoroughly I will create a new thread with the modified system for a new vote and discussion to find and improve any further flaws if possible. \n\nThanks again all!
