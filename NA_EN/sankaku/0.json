This is Story, Art, and Sound. Your post relates mainly to a Gameplay mechanic - I'd suggest reposting it there since this forum's primarily about discussing the art behind skins, not the mechanics behind skin shards. You might get better discussion there since you've got a good point.\n\n\nWell, I'd like to follow your suggestion but I don't know which post you're referring to. Could you show me what it was to remind me what I had a good point about?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-18T03:10:52.455+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No worries! I was able to find your original post, which had something to do with being able to trade skin shards. Honestly, I think it could possibly be a pretty cool idea as well! Hit up the Gameplay or Client Discussion boards to make sure more people see your idea ^_^!","replies":[]}]}
