Pretty sure the team could too.  \nSomething like \"Varus finally accepted the Darkin's deal: a revenge in exchange for the Darkin's delivrance. But with time, the Darkin came to understand how human feelings worked, he understood what drove Varus mad.\" The story officially ends here, but there is a possibility of them making peace, since their goals aren't this separate one from another. Maybe the Darkin is okay with killing only Noxians for eternity. Maybe they both realize that killing isn't the solution? Maybe in the end, the Darkin still fully consumes Varus because even though he \"liked\" him (as much as a Darkin can like), he wasn't attached enough to not take his part of the deal.  \n  \nThis litterally took me less than 5 minutes, and a story built upon that (with the talent of a true narrative team, I'm just a randumb that doesn't even speak english correctly) would have pleased everyone.
