It would make it a lot easier for someone to who has 1 pc but has multiple people who play the game or even for people playing on multiple accounts for some reason. It just seems like something that wouldn&#039;t be too hard to implement so i was just curious as to why it doesn&#039;t exist. also it makes it easier for people who have worse setups to play the game, i know that when i used to play i had a really bad laptop and a lot of the time the client would freeze up or bug out and when i closed it, having to re open it was a gamble because i was never sure if it would actually open without me having to restart my laptop but idk if that is just a problem with me i know this  has probably been asked before but i&#039;m just personally curious as to why it isn&#039;t a thing yet","replies":[]}
