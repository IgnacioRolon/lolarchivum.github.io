I'm wondering why isn't there a +$5 worth of RP increment purchase system or the sorts.\n\nThese are the online transaction increments: $5, $10, $20, **_$35_**, **_$50_**, $100. \nNotice the difference in the increments in the middle. As I've heard, there is a $25 gift card you can purchase from various stores. But the point here is to buy the \"right amount\" that you want without having to go through the way of going to a store for just a $25 gift card or making multiple purchases while losing out on the extra RP. \n\n(Purchasing a $25 RP gift card = 3500 RP. Purchasing a $5 (650 RP) and $20 (2800 RP) from the client's Store = 3450. 3500-3450 = 50 extra RP loss, yes this is just measly amount. Again, the point is to purchase just the \"right amount\" you want from the client's Store.)","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-15T23:42:39.632+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't work on the store team, so I don't have an answer for you as to why you can't purchase RP in other increments. :/\n\nIf have any other questions, though, please let me know.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"aNewMoonIsRising","date":"2016-12-15T01:14:19.781+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"will there be a snow down sale shop? like last year.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"aNewMoonIsRising","date":"2016-12-14T22:54:41.534+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"probably not an rp sale but hopefully they have the snow down skin sales. been trying to find info on it","replies":[]}]}
