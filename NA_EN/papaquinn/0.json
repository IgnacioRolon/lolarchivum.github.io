Although it wont allow me to select ranked but i can select ranked for 3v3. Im a confused because im able to play draft which i though had the same requirements as ranked.

You might not have enough champions in your pool for Ranked yet.  You'll need to get 20 champs under your belt, then you should be able to join your friends in Ranked.
