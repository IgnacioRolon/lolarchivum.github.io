But my idea may get some ideas rolling on the table so here goes nothing. \r\n\r\nThe idea is that when he/she autos they gain a stack. Then they can refund that stack for an ability. Like their **Q** would take up 60 stacks so they would need to auto 60 times. The idea is to build attack speed so you can use more of your abilities. And who knows this maybe the marksmen udyr that gypsylord wanted to do with jinx. So yeah just an idea to chew on.","replies":[{"poster":"R18","date":"2016-10-18T13:20:45.760+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Crit should give 2x stacks. But don't make runnans stack.

No joke, you should check it out if you want to see how I explored the concept. [#ShamelessPlug ](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/GFhBX9FA-urgot-rework-making-him-cool-again)\n\n\"Passive: Terror Core- Urgot builds charges as he lands basic attacks, with 4 basics a charge and a max of 5 charges. With each charge, he gains 2/3/4/5% more Total AP & AD. However, Urgot also loses 4/3/2/1% attack speed and 10 attack range. Upgrades every 6 levels.\n(This is what I based this entire kit around, an ADC that doesn't have to worry about mana, and works on a charge system, kinda like Fulgore or Hakumen. However, he does need each of these charges to use an ability, which provides clear counter-play and weaknesses that can be played around. He also works better if he has something to build stacks off of, so he actually works well when there are minions.)\"\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"Elq","date":"2016-10-18T14:06:36.034+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like it, However the example number of 60 is pretty high for a standard q ability.
