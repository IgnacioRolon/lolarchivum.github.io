NEW CLIENT DOWNLOADING MORE THAN 12GB!!!","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As the title said. I had to reinstall league due to some technical difficulty, and when i tries to reinstall it first said that it will download ~8gb which was fine by me. But then i tried to upgrade it to the new client and it is downloading 13600 MB with an eta of 12 hours(slightly slow net). Is this normal? Is there any other way?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-03-26T23:18:03.961+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The legacy client will try to download our updated client as part of it's normal patching process. You don't necessarily have to _use_ the updated client, but you will need to let it finish that download before it will let you login.","replies":[{"poster":"Life909","date":"2017-03-27T07:42:49.037+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh, ok then.
