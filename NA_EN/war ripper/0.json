A recent update enabled a feature called *Game DVR* which is causing system freezes for some players. I strongly recommend [disabling the Game Bar](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html) as a first step to see if it resolves the issue.\n\nLet me know if this did resolve the problem.","replies":[]},{"poster":"hyperion3182","date":"2016-10-03T13:49:21.606+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you a Windows 10 user who got a recent W10 Anniversary update?
