Anyways my point is that the shield doesnt effect this equation as it adds a static amount of hp that is not effected by the healing, making it almost useless in the jungle. you would be much better served by adding some armr runes to your jungle runes and grabbing a point in the bonus armr mastery, or simply get someone to leash you lol\n______________________________________________________________________________________\n\nedit 2: normal hp is still effective in my equation because it doesnt eliminate H, same is true about lifesteal as it adds to H and decreases S, typically if you are having trouble in jungle at any level i would say grabbing a quick armr item or lifesteal depending on the champ, will greatly help your champ, try it you will see\n____________________________________________________________________________________\nedit 3: \nheres a post i made on the jungle update post what do you guys think?\n> So i have been thinking with regards to possibly replacing runic shielding and an idea came to me in a dream (yes i dream about league of legends XD) for something to help junglers. What if there was a mastery that was kinda like the tank version of static shiv (bear with me for a sec) as you spent time not fighting jungle (so including while you are ganking) you gained stacks until the next time you entered into combat with jungle farm you gained a small increase to your armr for 7 secs, basically 15 or so armr for 7 seconds. i think this would make level one jungle alot easier AND would reward tanky junglers for ganking as it would help them build up stacks to go and take red/blue buff a little more securely. it would go in the same mastery slot that runic shielding currently holds.","replies":[{"poster":"youngjake93","date":"2015-03-13T22:47:52.573+0000","up_votes":43,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean it would literally be worth keeping if they just made it refresh when you recall.
