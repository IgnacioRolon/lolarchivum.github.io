Daenrys hit me up to check this out for you to see what might be happening. \n\nAs posted in my update [**here**](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/FmA64Jmo-get-out-while-you-can-account-transfers-are-back) these transfer are likely overloaded from the flood of incoming transfer requests. They're working normally so far, but the sheer amount of transfers have slowed things down a bit. It looks like this account started its transfer earlier today, but it should definitely happen before too much longer.\n\nQuick FYI as well, it's possible that you might have needed to update your login info when you transferred as well. If you don't remember that new info, be sure to use the forgot my username/password feature on the support site!","replies":[]},{"poster":"DaenrysTargaryen","date":"2018-01-25T20:43:47.235+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would suggest submitting a [Support Ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us)  to Riot to help you with that.","replies":[{"poster":"Freijorking","date":"2018-01-25T20:58:02.175+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i can't login on that account to send a support ticket","replies":[{"poster":"TrikzterzArma","date":"2018-01-25T21:09:34.871+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"But you're logged in here..?","replies":[{"poster":"Freijorking","date":"2018-01-25T21:13:43.019+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I mean i said in the post it was another account...","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-01-25T21:17:22.639+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Freijorking,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=2TVidJoz,comment-id=0000000000010000,timestamp=2018-01-25T21:13:43.019+0000)\n>\n> I mean i said in the post it was another account...\n\nSend a support ticket from this account with all relevant info if it wont go through, cant hurt.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"DaenrysTargaryen","date":"2018-01-25T21:08:01.022+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm ok, Then I do not know what else to tell you sorry.
