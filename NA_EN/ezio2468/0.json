The sound effects are perfectly audible, but i guess the announcer and my champions get their tongues cut out for some reason. Then, after about 5 minutes, the game will freeze for an obscene amount of time. The longest being around 8 minutes. I'm just wondering if anyone else's client does this or if it's just me, and if anyone has a fix for it.\r\n\r\nMy PC is the limited edition star wars hp pavillion laptop if that helps at all. Thank you.{{champion:112}}","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-04T18:06:44.877+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like there may be hardware or severe driver issues going on that are causing this to happen.
