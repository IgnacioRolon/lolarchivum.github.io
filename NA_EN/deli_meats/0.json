I'd love to get a system that lets me select multiple roles that I'd accept to a lane.\n\n\nA few suggestions gathered from the comments:\n\nAllow the captain to mark multiple roles that would be accepted in a lane\n~~Allow the captain to mark multiple roles that would *not* be accepted in  a lane~~ excessive with above\nGive solos the ability to queue as a champ w/ multiple lanes or roles selected \nGive solos the ability to queue as a lane w/o selecting champ first\n\n\n\nAlso, Riot I love team builder!
