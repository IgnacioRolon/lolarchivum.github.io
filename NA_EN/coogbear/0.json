The chest icons on your profile show how many champion mastery chests you can obtain for that week.  Once obtained, the icon will fade out and one slot will refresh in roughly a week.

After reading the hex tech crafting guide, I am certain that there are 4 champion mastery chest available when I look into the Profile Section. Some anecdotal reasons why I believe this: I remember seeing a message saying that the \"next chest will come in x days\" or something along those lines, but it's no longer there; I haven't opened a chest since I started the game last month; and I've definitely been in games where my partners or I have received \"S\" ratings.\n\nI guess my question is, are \"Champion Mastery Chest\" different from \"Hextech Chest?\"","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sardonic Sloth","date":"2016-08-28T05:21:25.596+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think I get your problem, or I MIGHT. the chests in your PROFILE, when golden, are chests you are ABLE to earn by getting S-ranks on champs or having a queue-mate earn an s-rank on a champ, not chests you actually OWN.
