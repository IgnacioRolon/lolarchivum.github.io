Can this somehow be changed as a sound effect? I usually disable my music in the options because I don't like to have summoner's rift music playing, but this means I have to re-enable it in the options to listen to DJ sona (if she's in a a game). If her music was treated as a different type of music or sound option, it would be great to not have to keep flipping the options back and forth everytime a DJ sona is in my game (or i'm playing her).","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-02-26T00:30:36.777+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I can't promise we'll make a change to it, but I'd be happy to pass your feedback on.","replies":[{"poster":"Idenn","date":"2015-02-26T03:11:37.357+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot KateyKhaos,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=E6XIxhwr,comment-id=000100000000,timestamp=2015-02-26T00:30:36.777+0000)\n>\n> I can't promise we'll make a change to it, but I'd be happy to pass your feedback on.\n\nAlright sweet. Actually now that i think about it though, it would be difficult to impliment without something that auto mutes the normal music, otherwise both tracks would play over each other, but even just a hotkey that allows us to quickly mute/unmute the music would be great.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Grashnim","date":"2015-02-26T00:11:17.310+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Just saw DJ Sona in game, LOL looks like trash.","replies":[{"poster":"Raja Chachki","date":"2015-02-26T00:24:32.594+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol what are you talking about, it's the best looking skin in the game....as far as ultimate skins go.","replies":[{"poster":"SpartenA7991","date":"2015-02-26T07:35:20.714+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Don't feed the troll. {{champion:48}} {{champion:48}} {{champion:48}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Grashnim","date":"2015-02-26T13:34:34.033+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm glad you like it.
