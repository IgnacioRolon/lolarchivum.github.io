I already know that you&#039;re thinking &quot;oh well you can just earn more points for another chest&quot; or &quot;well just get an s for a champion you don&#039;t play&quot;. Before you even tell me about all that dumb shit I&#039;m just gonna be blunt and say that I&#039;m god damn tired man :/ I&#039;m sick and tired of having to do all this random, even dumb shit for a chest that will have a 89% chance of giving me some shit that I have no use for, and you all know I&#039;m right. I mean why the holy pieces of hell would I get chest after chest after chest(some of them I don&#039;t even buy) and get something I don&#039;t want, and possibly aint even worth a pile of the presidents shit. First of all the skins I&#039;m getting aren&#039;t even worth disenchanting, and they cost too fucking much to make permanent I mean who the fuck who make something like that :/. Honestly its almost season 8 and this shit is getting to damn old, I&#039;m tired of getting all this random shit for champs I don&#039;t even play. bye","replies":[]}
