It&#039;s awesome, and it&#039;s also awesome that login music is a regular feature with new champs and new events. I remember only a few years ago when you wow&#039;d us with the first New Champ Login Music and you&#039;ve been doing it continuously ever since. \n\nThanks for doing a great job with lol Audio. I&#039;ve been around since before Season 1 and you guys have always been pretty fantastic at your jobs. I appreciate the team of Audio Designers and Engineers working at Riot and I think they should pay you all more.\n\nCheers!\n\nPS: Not to mention the amazing job you guys do with cinimatic trailers and music videos.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Eno","date":"2015-04-29T05:28:01.245+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"[Thank yoooooou!](http://33.media.tumblr.com/47654283d4dff74954fc255949a097a8/tumblr_mk0ps7Szez1riafl6o1_400.gif)","replies":[]}]}
