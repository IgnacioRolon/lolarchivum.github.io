But for the past few months I have been fine and played league with no lag. Then one week ago I started lagging. But I am starting to think it is not a regular type of lag. I will connect to the game fine but as soon as I spawn it says \"Attempting to Reconnect\".  I would have to disconnect, and if I got lucky I could reconnect without a problem. But that doesn't always happen. If I reconnected, in the middle of a fight it would not say \"ATR\", it would just freeze me in movement. I could click and I can see everyone else moving fine but I cannot move. Can anyone help me with this problem?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-07T03:03:21.179+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Those random disconnects could maybe be fixed by going through the [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues), but later on when you mention freezing randomly it kinda sounds like you might be having some packet loss problems too. \n\nGrab the network logs from that game if you can and let our [**log reader**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743) scan it. That'll give me a good idea of what was going on with your connection at that time.","replies":[]}]}
