A dark thunder Nami. I am still working on adding in the shading details to the fins which will be the dark teal. I am also working on changing her staff into a trident. I have yet to start working on the animation aspects of her spells though of course these would also change. Her Q would be a swirl of marbled dark teal and royal purple. Her W would splash dark purple and slate black. Her E would encase the target in two purple and one teal bubble along with black crackling lighting. Her R would color into mostely slate black with tendrils of purple and teal. Not really sure what more to put here so, I hope you like the concept and if you have anything to add please feel free to comment.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-03-02T19:25:34.298+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love the idea for the particles! \n\nAs Deep Terror Nami said - it is pretty similar to the base, but your paintover is still pretty sweet.When I hear ideas about dark-themed Nami, I immediately think of shockowaffel's idea of a Sea Witch Nami - \n\nhttp://orig08.deviantart.net/8bad/f/2014/337/0/a/sea_witch_nami_splash_art_by_shockowaffel-d88fyz0.jpg\n\nIMO, your particle ideas mixed with shocowaffel's model would be amazing together. :3","replies":[{"poster":"SupportCandy","date":"2016-03-03T14:15:05.451+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh that is so beautiful!
