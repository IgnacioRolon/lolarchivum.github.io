For example, the previous (pre 5.22) build was wildly different and a lot weaker, but I'm sure people on 5.22 still build those items. Similarly. Zed's winrate skyrocketed from 5.23 (when the shadow changes were implemented) to 5.24 (no significant changes). What explains that? Maybe people getting used to the massive amount of changes that were made? \n\nHe was buffed in 5.23, and his winrate is steadily rising, suggesting that people are figuring out his power, and is one of the most picked mids.

Zeds average games for playerbase is in the 100s and was even with his ridiculously high playrate, that shows a very dedicated playerbase, and this is the explanation for low winrates on bullshit champs.

Illaoi just disappeared, huh? And plus - you still havent given a good explanation on why Zed's winrate for one patch matters. Ive given you a couple examples why its a good idea to wait - because champions like Udyr and Pantheon shot up in winrate with no buffs. \n\nIncarnation is the only pro player ive heard complain about Zed. And it was about the delay on his Ult, which was done a very long time ago. This was NOT when his winrate dropped on patch 5.22. It was back in patch 5.9. SO unless you want to bring up Zed's stats back then, its utterly irrelevant. \n\nI was referring to Tahm support and Ryze Mid for the stats, who have an extremely low winrates, and have had low winrates. Lee Sin has. and has always had a low winrate. You really want buffs for those champs? Some of the most broken (Ahm. not OP, but broken) kits. \n\"Anyone that low needs a buff\"? So we need Illaoi and Lee Sin buffs, right? And Jhin, Veigar, Viktor, Syndra, Vlad, Olaf, Gnar, Lissandra, Yasuo, Tryn too, right. After all, if Zed cant manage to spend one patch with a lowwinate, he needs to be buffed once that shoots him back to over 50%, so we need some Lissandra buffs since she counters Zed so hard yet has a low winrate. \n\nAnd Zed's games played doesnt necessarily mean that Zed has a dedicated playerbase. Actually, in light of his pickrate, id say he is just played by freelo abusers. Heimerdinger had a dedicated playerbase - one of the lowest picks, but managed an amazing winrate. Having a good winrate and a high pickrate just means he is strong. You dont need to be amazing mechanically when you can Ult-E-Q-(Ghostblade)-Auto a few times and be able to kill tanks. \n\nAnd its hard to take someone seriously thinking that Zed needed buffs when their name is \"UrZedM8\".

Other melee assassins have to calculate the risk for almost every single minion they want to lasthit. Zed's got his Q and if his Q isn't enough or even that is too risky to use he can use his shadow so he can get cs with his E as well or just clear the wave pretty damn fast. Besides that his shadow is an incredible zoning tool, especially since most mid laners he faces don't too good defensive stats/abilities or health sustain.\nHe just farms to the point where he thinks he can kill you and then goes in while still being pretty safe for his engages duration.\n\nIf Zed was nerfed in a way so he would have to commit to lasthitting or staying healthy in the early game I wouldn't even mind if he'd have a stronger powerspike after that, but right now it's hilarious how safe he can be played while still not falling behind and forcing lots of mid-laners into rushing Zhonya's.\n\nIt's not even that I've got massive problems with Zed, but that's more because of the champions I play and not because of Zed himself.\n\nMore risk, more reward.","replies":[{"poster":"Only Play Darius","date":"2016-02-03T08:09:54.146+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":5,"body":"I mean most mages play it safe during laning phase too.

Zed is vulnerable to such lockdowns too, but he has the ability to assassinate most mages and immobile squishies extremely fast and even if he makes a horrendous mistake or misses most of his damage he can still get out of the fight in almost any situation.\nChamps like Fizz can do the same, but their area of action is way smaller and if he fails to kill his target there's still a good chance to get him. Zed has a shadow out of your towers range, follows and attacks you until you reach your second turret and he'll still get out most of the time.\nDunno...it just feels kinda wrong in many situations.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ereiserengo","date":"2016-02-03T13:00:31.140+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":4,"body":"The point is that zed main assassination tool (ultimate) is super easy to counter.

Otherwise, if Zed needs an instant escape, he can always throw out his W first, press R, then switch back to W.\n\nZed's biggest nerf last year was to his AS. It is currently around ~2/3 of his original value at level 18 because he was too strong at taking towers as a split pusher.\n\nFor a long time he remained a mediocre pick. He is only popular now because he is one of the few AD assassins who can proc TL from range.

Teams don't want those early fights, because they know how much losing them and giving a assassin/adc 2 kills will hurt them. \n\nGames now are pretty much even worse farm fests, and with the lack of vision, everyone plays super, super safe. LCS right now is \"who after 6 will hit the first successful gank mid or bot, and then play safe as hell and farm to protect that snowball?\"\n\nI mean, teams are now pretty much as a rule conceding bot and top towers just to get a safer lanning phase/ early trade on global gold.  That's always been a strategy teams do of course, but now it's pretty much just expected. For all the \"strategy\" involved, the pro games should just start with a tower down in each lane and the teams awarded the global gold.","replies":[{"poster":"Xonra","date":"2016-02-04T00:49:23.884+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot is the one who finds it boring I happen to enjoy strategic games a lot.\n\nThe current games have devolved into watching two teams stall and farm for 20 minutes then go ham for 5.
