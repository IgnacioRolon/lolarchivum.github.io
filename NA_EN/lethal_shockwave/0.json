I'm playing in the borderless window mode. But each time there is a patch my resolution would bug out. I can see it in loading screen and in the game. The league screen would be either a bit too big all around my screen or too big bottom right corner so i can't see the screen completely. I figured out a way to fix temporarily the problem but it is still quite annoying. I have to go to video settings and put it on full screen and then back to borderless and it fixes everything. I'm using a 1920 X 1080 resolution wich is my screen resolution.\n\nDoes anybody knows what i can do to solve the problem ? \n\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-14T23:47:03.827+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You could run into trouble if you're using a 4K or exceeding 1920x1080.  Your settings are otherwise acting pretty erattic so I'm curious if your config settings are acting up.  Try performing a reset of your config to see if this does the trick:\n\nLog into the game client.\nNavigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\nDelete the file  named **game.cfg** and **persistedsettings.json**\nGo into a custom game and verify that settings have saved properly.  Leave game to sync settings.\n\nLet me know if it fixes the issue!","replies":[{"poster":"Lethal Shockwave","date":"2017-01-18T18:29:37.356+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I did as you mentionned but the problem is still there. As I said, it's happening only when there are patches. So today, there was a mini patch on my league of legends and the problem happened. So I had to fix it the way I've been doing it for the past 8 month. So i went into setting and put it on fullscreen and then borderless to make it work as i want.\n\nThe problem is only happening in the loading screen and in the game itself. \n\nSo if you have any other idea on how to fix this i would appreciate :D If it has any effect i just reseted my windows lately and the problem is still going on.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-18T18:37:17.848+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for following up, even though it sucks that the issue persists.
