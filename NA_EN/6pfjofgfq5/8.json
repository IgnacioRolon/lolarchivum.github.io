Annoying lane phase where you have to rely on support to do well, dragon control is secondarily your responsibility after jungle, youre expected to kite when most champions can literally laugh at kiting attempts with ridiculous dive potential. Honestly ADC is the highlest skill floor and skill cap champion in the game, especially when you consider the role designated to fvk you up is lowest skill floor role in the game with a million ways to escape ( assassins ).","replies":[]}
