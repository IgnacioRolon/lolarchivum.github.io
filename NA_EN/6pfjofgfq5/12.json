Essentially beating these champions when you are not one of these champions is directly relative to whatever champions you are playing...ie; You are an ADC/ Support with a team with nothing but ADCs and supports that beat a team of melee ADs and assassins? You&#039;re very possibly one of the best players in the game and the skill level required goes down as you cycle through mages and tanks into other melee ADs and assassins\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA bronze assassin/ melee AD main is pretty much the worst player in the game, you&#039;re in the elo KNOWN for the ability to solo carry from as the most braindead player in the world and you cant solo carry with the most braindead champions in the game to carry from. You should probably go back to sniffing glue and chugging bleach =.=","replies":[]}
