{"poster":"Aqua Dragon","date":"2016-04-26T05:43:35.696+0000","title":"A Nuanced Look at Dragons, Randomness, and Competitiveness","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":399,"down_votes":17,"body":"There have been a number of comments critiquing the change to the random dragon spawning. For those unaware, in patch 6.9, every time a dragon spawns, it will randomly be a fire, air, water, or earth dragon each granting a different bonus to the team. **I want to go over a bit about the nature of random and what place it can serve in a competitive game, both good and bad.**\n\n***\n\n#Why not Just Give Gold Again?\n\nAs someone who primarily plays an objective controller, I can tell firsthand that **team gold is not an appreciable stat, even though it is an extremely strong stat.** Despite its strength, the sheer value given is just so difficult to appreciate because of how spread out the effect is. Back in Season 3, it was not uncommon to have grabbed six dragons yet the team feeling like nothing meaningful had happened, despite this being in excess of 4,500 gold.\n\nNote that **just because an effect is extremely strong doesn&#039;t mean it feels strong.** This is why several auras (Fiddles, Sona, Taric) have been extremely tuned or even removed, even though aura effects could easily be giving in excess of 1,500 gold worth of stats for a teamfight. **The issue is not one of strength, but allowing a player to appreciate that strength.**\n\n~~Consider too that **Rift Herald gives 250 team gold when it's killed, but you don't exactly see it as a super amazing point of team contention.** This is almost as much gold as the previous dragons used to give.~~\nREDACTED. My memory was wrong; the dragon gave far more than that.\n\nThe other issue, and one that Riot has more specifically alluded to, is that **when two objectives grant the same thing, tradeoffs feel unimpactful.** Trading a tower for a dragon used to feel like a zero sum game with no particular change for either team. At that point, the dragon may as well have not existed at all. \n\nThe current Dragon system was trying to make the tradeoff meaningful, and it is a success compared to the previous season, but it&#039;s not good enough. The concerns about competitive play revolving too heavily around lane swaps shows that trading dragon for towers still feels too zero-sum. Yet, if you simply increase the strength of every dragon, snowballing becomes a significant concern.\n\nThe question then becomes: **how do you make the tradeoff between a dragon and a tower meaningful without giving too much power to snowballing compositions?** Riot has decided to address this with random dragons. Is this good? bad? Let&#039;s discuss.\n\n***\n\n#What Makes Random Problematic? What Makes it Good?\n\nThere are many critiques about competitive games having random elements. The biggest critique is that **competitive games should not have random elements.** But that answer is insufficient; why *shouldn&#039;t* competitive games have random elements? To simply say &quot;Because it decreases competitiveness&quot; is a redundant answer that tells us nothing, so we must dig further. By exploring this question, a number of points emerge.\n\nRandom is **unfair** because it provides one team an advantage that they don&#039;t have control over. If we&#039;re playing Rock Paper Scissors, and I get Dynamite every tenth time, that feels unfair because there is nothing the other player can do except &#039;git gud&#039;.\n\nRandom is **unskillful** because it allows a path to victory that didn&#039;t require mechanical or strategic thought. You&#039;ll see this all the time on [Hearthstone if you&#039;re familiar with esports](https://youtu.be/LWjXwrCrHpE?t=22s), where losses often feel attributed to RNGesus rather than clever planning.\n\nRandom is **inconsistent** because it makes it difficult to plan a strategy. The update to Brand helps address a lot of the lottery involved with Pyroclasm, but until recently, whether it obliterated a teammate often just came down to how lucky they were.\n\nThis isn&#039;t all the concerns about random, but it&#039;s a large chunk of them. **But there are a lot of good things about Random too!**\n\nRandom promotes **adaptation** because it prevents all games from being decided wholly based on things set up before a game. Fundamentally, this is what makes card games interesting. Imagine if Magic allowed players to pre-sort their drawing order when playing; the meta would revolve around a more macro-level play about setting up the perfect deck orders in advance. Strategic? Probably. Fun to watch? Probably not as much.\n\nRandom prevents **monotony** because it allows games to play out differently each time. Imagine how boring games like Bejeweled would be if the order of the gems was the same each time. There&#039;s probably a speed-running market for that, but it would get monotonous pretty fast.\n\nRandom displays **quick thinking** because working with random elements often requires split-second evaluations. Being chased down a river in Dota 2 right as a River Rune spawns and grabbing the Invisibility Rune to turn around on the attacker and kill them feels pretty cool for the killer, and a ton of fun to watch too (even if the chaser feels salty). Note that I don&#039;t really like the River Rune system for reasons that will be clear soon, but there&#039;s no denying that randomness can reward being quick on your feet.\n\n***\n\n#Are there Good Randoms?\n\nSo our next question should be: are there ways to make Random maximize its good while minimizing its bad? This leads us to discussing aspects of Random.\n\n\n##Good Random has Equal Distribution for Players\n\nGood Random attempts to be fair by allowing all players the same chance of accessing the random element. Me getting dynamite every tenth rock-paper-scissors isn&#039;t nearly as unfair if you have the same chance of getting it as well. If we&#039;re playing Munchkins and drawing from the same deck, there&#039;s nothing strictly unfair about me getting a Loaded Die card and messing up your plans (Screw you, Luis). \n\n**But just because something is fair, doesn&#039;t mean it feels fair.** It will still feel unfair when I land Dynamite regardless of whether you have the same chance or not. This leads to our next point:\n\n##Good Random Does Not Have Too High or Too Low Variance\n\nVariance refers to how extreme the difference is between potential options. If there was a dragon that spawned that had the effect of &quot;You Win the Game&quot; by killing it, it wouldn&#039;t matter that both teams could take the dragon; it would simply not feel very fair due to how extreme it is compared to all the other dragons. This is because **high variance feels unfair even if it technically is fair.**\n\nThe larger the variance, the more unfair a random element feels. But lower variance isn&#039;t truly ideal either. If each dragon provided the exact same benefit, but gave a permanent +1 bonus to some random stat between AP, AD, AS, and CDR, it would feel like a fairly insignificant random element. This random element would pretty much just be needlessly complicating the game without adding anything meaningful.\n\nA balance must be struck between these two extremes. **The variance of the possibilities must be low enough to feel fair, but high enough to be meaningful.** That last word there is meaningful, both semantically and for our next point.\n\n##Good Random Promotes Adaptation\n\nPart of what makes high variance feel so terrible is that it feels like there was nothing that could have been done. There&#039;s usually no choice that could have been made to stop the random element from completely screwing everything up. There&#039;s a few things that can make it feel this way.\n\nIf something **is not telegraphed, it&#039;s extremely difficult to adapt play around it.** Going back to Brand&#039;s Pyroclasm, we see that in the past, there was an extremely small window between when it hit and when it looked like it was going to switch targets. The telegraph window was simply too small to play around.\n\nSimilarly, Blitzcrank&#039;s passive thunder from their ultimate and Kennen&#039;s random champion targeting during Maelstrom don&#039;t feel like they can be played around because they just sort of happen. Luck is still involved but it doesn&#039;t feel like it can be meaningfully outplayed outside of outpraying.\n\nThis is also one of the big concerns with the existence of Critical Chance. While crits allow laning phases to have some variance to avoid being the same each time a particular matchup happens, it still feels really bad to get killed by a lucky crit both because the variance is so high and because the window of avoiding the outcome was basically zero.\n\n**Compare this to Starcraft 2, where each player starts off in a random base. Because the location of the enemy is different each time, it incentivices different strategies.** What happens if you find the opponent earlier? Did you arrive in time to discover a wall being built or are they going with an early expand because the map is bigger and they won&#039;t be discovered as quickly? Would it be risky to focus on pumping out voidlings before knowing their exact location? Am I mixing up my games? Here we see an example of random fostering adaptation.\n\n***\n\n#Conclusions\n\nWith all this, we can discuss whether the extent of dragon randomness is too much.\n\nThe dragons are accessible by both sides, helping provide fairness. As many other commentators have noted, **each dragon serves as both an extreme benefit but also extreme detriment to the same composition.**\n\nThe Aqua Dragon&#039;s regeneration helps poke compositions with sieging, but if the other team gets it, makes it difficult to siege past the regeneration.\n\nThe Air Dragon&#039;s out of combat MS benefits rotating compositions, but makes it much harder to out rotate enemies that have gotten the Air Dragon instead.\n\nThe Earth Dragon&#039;s objective damage enhancer benefits diving compositions, but makes it much harder if enemies use that same buff to grab other objectives faster (baron).\n\nThe Fire Dragon. Yeah.\n\nThis means the relative benefit the dragon provides will be roughly the same for each team, so the impact it provides is more fair.\n\nAdditionally, concerns about dragons leading to less skill and more reliance on luck are likely ill founded. Because each dragon is heavily telegraphed (you know which dragon is spawning next), there is plenty of time to adapt play around it and make meaningful strategic tradeoffs. **If dragons still feel too luck-based and players feel it&#039;s too inconsistent to play around, Riot can use this telegraphing as a balancing lever by increasing the window of knowledge (maybe even to champion select).**\n\nHow big is the variance between each choice? This is perhaps the area where there will be the most disagreement. **I personally feel the variance seems to be in an alright spot, but others may see the variance as being too large**, and this is largely what determines whether it feels fair or not for most people.\n\nSo ultimately, **randomness does not necessarily mean less skillful or less competitive. With enough telegraphing and variance tuning, random can be made to promote skill and adaptation rather than remove it, but it must be done carefully.**\n\n***\n\nI hope you will have found this useful, or at the very least, help to clarify the discussions going forward about the dragons.","replies":[{"poster":"Wulf Helhammer","date":"2016-04-26T05:55:30.133+0000","up_votes":114,"down_votes":3,"body":"Name checks out.\n\n\nVery well written and thought out.

The new buffs are just far too impactful for specific team comps, providing excessive power to some team comps and an average or below average amount of power to others, meaning a team that is focused around taking towers gains a much larger benefit than the enemy team and leaving the enemy team with the option of getting the negligible buff in order to prevent the buff getting into the hands of their enemy or allowing the enemy team to obtain it and end up being at a significantly great differential in power than if they obtained it themselves.  \nThe current dragon increases snowball potential on the first dragon alone, not every consecutive dragon.  \n  \n**_TL;DR: new dragons are poor random design that add far too much RNG to the game.

When playing defensively earth doesn't benefit you at all.\n\nAir is in my experience the most balanced of them, it benefits pretty much every team regardless of anything and everything. \n\nWater is decent, but it has an incredible \"win lane\" effect which is far more potent than the siege/anti-siege effect that it has. I've rarely noticed its value as a siege/anti-siege tool, but as a lane sustain tool and an instant regen tool in teamfights it's been far more potent. Benefiting teams that want to snowball through lane or teamfighting teams more. \n\nFire is second most balanced since everyone wants it, but it's still significantly more useful on teams that run 3 or more damage dealers than teams that run 2 and the rest are tanks. It's also a lot more valuable to teams with Jhin or Veigar and similar, but there's not much that can be done about that. \n\nI know it's annoying to have someone comment about specifics and the nitpicky stuff. The new dragons are my favorite part of 6.9, it's been so fun to play with them, but I have to admit they're not as balanced as one might think originally. I agree that the randomness would be perfect and I would have no issue with it if it being valuable to one team meant it was equally valuable to the other, but that's usually not the case.\n\nWhile contesting the dragons may become common to deny buffs, if one team has an advantage when they actually GET the buff in the end, then the buff isn't really balanced enough for the competitive scene imo.\n\nThe added randomness has caused each and every game with elemental dragons to feel significantly different in a positive way, something that Riot has often claimed as a goal and I feel this is their biggest success so far. Just wanted to comment on that as well.","replies":[{"poster":"Atanchan","date":"2016-04-26T16:28:20.532+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":1,"body":"A minor thing, but while the earth dragon may not benefit a defending team at the current moment, they've already lost if they can't make use of it - after all, if they can't get into a situation where they can destroy buildings, then there's no chance of them winning because you win by destroying a building.\n\nOn the flipside, however, if the defending team does manage to get the momentum into their favor, the earth dragon allows them to capitalize harder than they previously could.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Aqua Dragon","date":"2016-04-26T17:19:42.281+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think this is a fair critique. One of the principles outlined was that both teams have access to the random element. But if a dragon isn't serving it's job of providing that access, because it's so much better suited for a team composition than against it, then it's no longer providing sufficient access.\n\nAs a more extreme example: if there was a dragon that boosted all magical damage by 30%. This would be totally awesome to get as a magic composition, and totally worthless if a physical enemy composition got it instead. This bonus isn't fair access to the random element.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Stained Spear","date":"2016-04-27T02:16:45.316+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"How can we be certain he isn't in on this, I mean he is a AD malzahar jungle main named aqua dragon, now he gets ad malzahar buffed and an aqua dragon?

It helps a team that wants to trade objectives and accelerate the game, but doesn't help a team that needs to defend.  It seems like a \"win more\" dragon -- if you're ahead and can put pressure on enemy buildings it helps you a lot, and if the other team is putting pressure on YOUR buildings it only has denial value.\n\nAccordingly I would suggest adding a defensive buff -- your turrets take X% less damage per stack when at least one friendly champion is near them (multiple champions don't increase the bonus).  Requiring champion presence means that splitpushing and Zzrot/Banner can still be effective against it, if you find an undefended turret.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Turbine Blade","date":"2016-04-26T09:44:52.078+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hope soon they reapproach the Elder Dragon though. That's a big issue I have with the current composition and the random aspect. Wish there was a better way to communicate the concern. Sure, you can challenge any individual random dragon, but the dividends seem a little off to me. \n\nIn an even game, you'll pop maybe 4 Elementals - and suddenly you'll get the Elder pop at 35. If the enemy has more fire/earth dragons, it'll be hard to contest. But. More importantly. An even game would see teams splitting the 4 down the middle. Elder dragon gives 50% value to existing passive so for a period and some turret damage. Over the course of the game, any given dragon is worth more. And if you're behind in Elements,you're forced to contest it and Baron now despite the Elder having almost zero value to the team that's behind. \n\nIt's a simple fix, give an Elder Dragon kill an Elemental Dragon effect. If this seems too strong upfront, give the element at the end of the buff. As is, I think some scenarios make dragons vastly underwhelming in the new set up.\n\nI also think limiting the Air Dragon to just out of combat is fairly mediocre, and that the scaling cap on MS hurts it and it's Elder Dragon boost, but do understand that MS can be the best stat in some circumstances.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ProfDrDeath","date":"2016-04-26T06:22:36.032+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":2,"body":"My upvote button just broke.

For those unaware, in patch 6.9, every time a dragon spawns, it will randomly be a fire, air, water, or earth dragon each granting a different bonus to the team. **I want to go over a bit about the nature of random and what place it can serve in a competitive game, both good and bad.**\n> \n\nI'm going to add to your post in a way that I believe is consistent with the way you are talking about this concept and then I am going to suggest a slightly \"better\"? way. I think assigning human values to the gameplay mechanics based on their qualities is important, but its also important to assign less subjective values and its important not to mix those in one discussion. But I digress.\n\n\n\nThere are a lot of types of decisions you can make based on random events:\n\n\nA) Theres a type where you think \"ok this can happen or this can happen and so Ill sort of want to be prepared for both and then deal with it when it gets decided\". That displays creativity and problem solving and games should have that.\n\nB) Theres also a type of decision that displays decisiveness as opposed to creativity. So, \"i dont know which of A or B will happen, but acting AS IF I did know A was going to happen is BETTER than not acting at all. Even if I am wrong and B happens then I will be better off if I act confidently and decisively\". Its different from the first in that you CANT prepare for both, but you can prepare.\n\nC) There are also decisions where you cant prepare. It tests your reactions.\n\nD) There are decisions where you have to plan A LOT to really map everything out. It can even be an exponential type task. Those have certain characteristics, btw. There tends to be a hard ceiling where you no one can really do much better than the group of ppl who do it best. The next discrete improvement on the decision making process costs too much. These not only test your planning, but they also test your confidence. I.E. \"Ive made this plan and I know that my opponent knows this plan because its obvious to anyone as good as we are, but I also know that he doesn't have the mental power to take it one step further. Im one of the best and he might be a little better, but not enough better to hit that next level\".\n\nThats not a complete list...this is part of the list which is why its not good to start off by talking about your human values that you associate with the game mechanics. Too much human.\n\n\nOk so I tried to go about it in the way that you do, which is classifying decisions-based-on-random-processes according to what they promote. This is the ok approach, but its not complete and I think its got problems. This is a good statement of what purpose it serves and it is a noble purpose: It give human semantics, which we need to base our artistic design decisions. The problem is that you cant divide things cleanly like this, except in intellectual abstraction, and abstraction is a really loose and foggy tool which ppl like to uselessly disagree around.\n\nIf you want any practical discussion, you need a \"game space\" where you can talk about where different gameplay mechanics fit on a continuous field. The truth is, there is no bad random. There is maybe/probably/i believe in \"better\" random and \"worse\" random. The \"game space\" ive been talking about is important to help you talk about MOVING mechanics from one area of the board/continuous field to another area. You justify those movements by attaching the semantics weve been talking about.\n\nThe first task is to understand this field and its dimensions and then test if you can fit gameplay mechanics onto it and talk about moving them around in it by varying parameters. \n\nTHEN you try and fit the semantics in based on your understanding of art. Once you reach that point, you can no longer \"be wrong\" and that is why you do it last. You've left the realm of objectivity.\n\n*Edits did occur.
