Now there are 2 factors that go into him having a good winrate the biggest is that since people never see champions played like that they cant adjust to it or play around it so they lose, two most people that play off meta in high elo are good at the game or know how matchs up work and how to play into them thats how he has a high winrate but the biggest thing is I dont know how having a high winrate is proof that he is not griefing since griefing is making players on your team have a bad game on purpose.

Its an extra 220.\nHow much base AP does karth need to get 220 damage out of his E to counter the damage gained a simple 2 seconds of life? Lets see... at a rate of 0,2   1100 AP.   That's the break even point... and note... Tank karth does not NEED the ap. he uses EXP to translate into levels which bumps his base damage per second up.  Oh right... and we also would need to subtract the AP the OP's build uses so... 1100 ap + AP gained from tanky items to break even for 2 seconds.\n\nHis R being weaker? So fucking what?  We talking about the ability he cant cast under pressure cuz its a 3 second channel time. That's on a CD of  200 / 180 / 160.   We looking at a .75 Ap scaling.  He can still Eliminate low HP champions with its base damage, 250 is enough to kill.\n\nBad wave clear? dude puts out aoe 240 damage per second base levels.\n\nDo you see how this works yet? 2 seconds IS statistically significant and the Up time is way more powerful per second gained from durability. 2 is notable. 4 is over 2k ap. 6 seconds of lifes worth over 3k Ap. With just a few 2 second intervals even if we account for his R the damage he loses to the rest of his kit going to outweigh that .75 scaling.\n\n\"but what if he misses Qs\" Well then we assume the same for the model of an AP build and we end up with a champion doing the same wiffed damage, who dies faster. in other words a karth missing Qs with an AP build IS weaker then a tanky build missing Qs. \n\nThis is just on paper. How ever I do hope it has been made clear that it only takes a few extra seconds on the champion to up his DPS to levels that AP builds cant match.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"MrFawknSunshine","date":"2018-09-29T21:42:49.299+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"off meta isnt suppose to be punishable or reportable. where it crosses the line if you are legit trolling and not trying to win or help team. alot of your off meta isnt really all that off meta from what you described. ap kog is old school kog mid , he is better on hit with hybrd items. tank karthus kinda makes sense he builds tanky ap items, orianna support i have seen it since season 3 off n on. jungle malz i have seen quite a bit. seen alot of velkoz support bot. so as long as you dont troll and int i dont care and neither should any one else and clearly riot is ok with what you are playing. \n\nshit i use to do nunu top. maokai mid, sona crit top. i still do ad bruiser maokai . i have supported with nearly any champ that has cc. jungled galio. i use to main galio support ( prior to rework ) so whatever","replies":[{"poster":"3TWarrior","date":"2018-09-30T17:49:59.560+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"wasn't nunu top meta until sometime in Season 5 ?","replies":[{"poster":"MrFawknSunshine","date":"2018-09-30T17:54:39.244+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"egh it was a troll pick i use to use it against riven, tryn, singed. i did play alot of nunu top and nunu support ( i know nunu support use to be a thing way back when.) got mastery lvl 7 on nunu top as a counter pick.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Cheini","date":"2018-09-30T05:58:52.436+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"basically high-five fellow.. thoooooough in silver people don't even try to win when they see off-meta champions and flame you for every bad thing that happens in the game :d\n\ni might try being a bit more careful (i also haven't been punished though!) and see how this ends up here.. though 3 months is too long in deed :(","replies":[]},{"poster":"Alzon","date":"2018-09-29T20:58:15.647+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"Big fan!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Saibbo","date":"2018-09-30T10:29:38.261+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":">124 Reports in 90 Days, about 270 games.\n\n##LMAO what are those baby numbers?\n**\"HATE_SPEECH\" : 33,**\n\"LEAVING_AFK\" : 72,\n\"VERBAL_ABUSE\" : 126,\n**\"INAPPROPRIATE_NAME\" : 3,**\n\"NEGATIVE_ATTITUDE\" : 186,\n\"ASSISTING_ENEMY_TEAM\" : 83,\n**\"THIRD_PARTY_TOOLS\" : 8**\n\nA grand total of 511 reports in (i assume, this is the number of logs that i had) 240 games but maybe it's more than 240, yet not even 1 chat restriction lel, the fun part i usually don't even type in chat or ping anyone, from the 240 logs only like 40 have something written on them, but like 2-3 lines for most of them too","replies":[]},{"poster":"Eternal Torment","date":"2018-09-30T21:14:09.679+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So basically you say it is a lose lose\n\nIf you say too little people get angry at you for not communicating, but if you say even remotely much people immediately make fun of you as a toxic player.\n\nDamn.","replies":[{"poster":"Aqua Dragon","date":"2018-09-30T21:40:58.039+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The only winning move is not to play.","replies":[{"poster":"Eternal Torment","date":"2018-09-30T21:49:08.981+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"*BOYCOT RIOT CONFIRMED*\n\n***REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE***","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Zertryx","date":"2018-09-30T09:41:55.047+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually really like APC bot Velkuza, and with the pros playing stuff like swain bot it helped mitigate the hate i get when i do play him as the \"bot\" role\n\nHe has good clear, long range, mana is a bit tight but if u play smart you can keep your mana up well and at 6 you and the support have high kill potential, honestly i feel velkoz is better bot than he is mid with how much Assassins / no mana champs mid are dominant","replies":[]},{"poster":"King Lego","date":"2018-09-30T08:58:57.246+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hold on...\nAre all the reports from your own team?
