Or do I just have a bad memory?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-02T02:55:25.169+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"We don't reset accounts or remove content for inactivity, so I'm inclined to agree with *Lew* here that you likely logged into a different account than the one you had previously accessed.\n\nYou can use the [*forgot username*](https://account.leagueoflegends.com/na/en/forgot-username) tool to see if it will send you the correct username tied to your email.
