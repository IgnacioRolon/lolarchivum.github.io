Will all of the information you installed on that flash drive stay in that flash drive, and will you have to install it again after you've taken the flash drive out and put it back in? Will the information you installed be put on the PC, or will it just stay in the flash drive? I want to install heroes of the storm on to my flash drive and play it from that flash drive since I don't wanna take up space on my PC.","replies":[]}
