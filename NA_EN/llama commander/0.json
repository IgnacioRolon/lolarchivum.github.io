I waited the low priority que time and got into a ranked game again and when loading in i got the same error and found out it was avg about 3 mins after so i disabled it loaded into the game and it got remade right when i got back in, now im in s4 75 lp and have 2 leaves... riot please fix your patches and at least put a bigger message on league saying avg crashes this patch instead of making people have to find one response to a forum post. Please fix...","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-31T23:19:05.076+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We're in no way able to control what AVG or other Antivirus applications will flag as *malicious* inside of the patches.
