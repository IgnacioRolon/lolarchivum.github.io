It is consistently the only thing that has any lag and I don't see why. If it was spikes then Id understand that maybe there was something wrong with my connection. But its wired and it has never had any issues with inconsistency. Any idea why league is just constantly at 150-300 ping?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-01T03:13:12.344+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"CS:GO servers are pretty spread out and most of them aren't located in Chicago, where the League servers are. This means this can be a routing problem to only League, but we'll need to confirm everything is good on your local network before we check your route. I'd strongly recommend working through our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to ensure none of your local network configurations are conflicting with League.\n\nLet me know if this caused any change.","replies":[{"poster":"twtvBootysama","date":"2016-12-01T21:22:31.508+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I appreciate the quick reply. I never had problems like this before up until about maybe a month or so (give or take a week). I didn't do anything significant and the only thing I can think of anymore is messing around with my DNS settings. Other than that I don't see why this is happening or how to fix it. Only issue ive had the 6 years playing is lag because of inconsistent wifi connection due to our bad ISP. Im at a stump :C\n**EDIT-**Now Im receiving this error (https://gyazo.com/3a73630c4904371be00ada2d7978a241) and the RADS error in the legacy. The RADS error pops up instantaneously with the opening of lol.launcher.admin, even after disabling any kind of firewall or antivirus :CCC","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-02T00:56:36.921+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The login issue you saw was likely related to an external network issue that had unfortunately affected our login service among a few others as well.

But League just decides to be at 300 ping for no reason. Not a spike. I play a game and it never drops so I just have to not play until i try again a week later where it might work. What do?","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
