How many times a game do you actually use a scanner? I've watched a lot of games, I see them use it like 3-4 times. You can put down 16 Vision Wards for the cost of a Sight Stone and people clearly dont need that many. Money better spent towards actual USEFUL gear.\n\nFurther, a vision ward provides a sustained vision on the map. Lens farts out after 5 seconds, just long enough for a pathetic sightstone using support to solo kill 1 stealth ward.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"I Main Swain","date":"2015-07-20T16:45:12.790+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"my only problem is that I ALWAYS forget about it and kick myself the whole time for doing so.  it's so ridiculously gold efficient, especially if lane phase is still going.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rrett","date":"2015-07-20T13:54:02.860+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just learnt that it did that yesterday.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Blue Moon Wolf","date":"2015-07-20T01:41:53.971+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mufasa: you must never face check that place Simba, you are far too squishy and will feed their carry.
