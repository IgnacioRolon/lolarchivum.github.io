I didn&#039;t start ranked until about s3, which I then got to gold, and platnium 1 for the 4th season, and plat4 for season 5. I&#039;ve had a blast playing this game, but due to a lot of things, I think I&#039;ll leave for a few months. And here&#039;s why.\r\n\r\n1) TOXIC players: I don&#039;t know what happend this season, but I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve met a single kind/nice funny player, In the 230 games I&#039;ve played in ranked so far. Everyone just goes straight to arguing with eachother, name calling, etc. I mute them, but these types of players are why I lose most the time.\r\n\r\n2) SoloQ: I know this has been a big thing lately, being posted and asked. But The biggest letdown this season was no soloq, it dumbfounds me how they said they&#039;d give it to us a little bit after s6, but no word or any rioter has responded to this, how hard can it be to implement a system that was basically fine again?\r\n\r\n3) Balance: I&#039;m not going to go saying X and Y are so OP with no counterplay, but until you hit about diamond or high plat, players don&#039;t know how to deal with champions like master yi, xin, kog, malp, etc. So many champions are crazy right now, and it&#039;s upsetting.\r\n\r\n4) Verbal players: This ties into the toxic players, but I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve EVER been verbally abused this badly in any game, or in real life. This is a game, people play for fun, but If I have an offgame, god help me when the other 4 players on my team scream at me for going 0/4 in lane.\r\n\r\n5) Time: Riot has been trying to shorten games and it&#039;s obvious, but with the new system I&#039;m lucky if I get into a game within 30minutes. Champ select takes to long, the que timer takes a solid 5-30minutes depending on what roles you take. A lot of my friends actually stopped playing because they no longer can get a game going nice a quick now.\r\n\r\nNow sadly this is probably going to get down voted to oblivion, but even if it does, I&#039;d just like to say thank you to all the great and fun people I&#039;ve met playing this game, and to all the toxic players, I hope you get some help, because the fact you need to abuse someone over text chat is kinda pathetic.\r\n\r\nThis is by no means a Omg this game sucks complain QQ, but It&#039;s time for me to move on, thanks everyone for reading this, and I hope you have a wonderful week!{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[]}
