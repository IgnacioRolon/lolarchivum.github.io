I got back to the game not long ago, hit g1, and practially plat5. \r\n\r\nHis damage is amazing and such, but the glaring issue is how he&#039;s always countered, and he needs items, but could he be viable at higher tiers?","replies":[{"poster":"Hammermancer","date":"2017-12-04T04:35:59.522+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh wait, yo solo renekton plays a decent amount of veig top lane, so I mean.. it might actually be viable since the guy is high elo\n\nthen again if he ever stopped trolling I think he'd go pro","replies":[{"poster":"TTK Dreadnought","date":"2017-12-04T05:02:04.510+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">then again if he ever stopped trolling I think he'd go pro\n\nLess views then?","replies":[{"poster":"Hammermancer","date":"2017-12-04T05:11:44.965+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=TTK Techno,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ngsJiqNy,comment-id=00050000,timestamp=2017-12-04T05:02:04.510+0000)\n>\n> Less views then?\n\nBewm","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Gives No Lux","date":"2017-12-04T05:09:46.977+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"His stun gate is high utility and has good range so even if you're getting behind in the AP nuke department you are still a fully useful member of the team in fights.  IMO this combined with his ult that can be pretty effective even when behind makes him as viable as any other.\n\nHe has pretty good wave clear too so he won't get run over by push and roam champs.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MrButternuss","date":"2017-12-04T05:03:19.810+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Veigar can be really strong, yes.
