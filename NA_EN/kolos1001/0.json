But with that change give everyone 1 reroll per game, while being able to hold up to 2. Dodging removes your ability to gain rerolls for 5 games. As well as any rerolls you currently have(as such if you dodge because your team looks bad.)\n\nIn the end though I find the problem to be itemization. Something that can be fixed with trinkets. \n\n- GW trinket. Reduces healing done by champions who you've attacked and are under 40% hp. Upgraded version has an active that applies GW for 3 seconds to all attacks you do. \n- Shield Piercing. Shields cannot block more than 10% of a targets missing HP from your attacks. This cannot reduce the shield under 50% of it's value. Upgrade increases this to 20%. This helps keep them powerful at lower HP levels, but having a team of Karma, Lux and Janna wont make it feel impossible to deal any damage. \n- Snowball. Change it to a trinket. Remove the damage. \n- Sweeper. Shows nearby traps(radius increase with level). Upgrades to have the detection cloud. 2min CD. Reduced by 10s for every trap killed within your trinkets radius. \n- Cannon. Places a cannon down that attacks a turret once. Fixed true damage based on level. Upgrades to make every 4th basic attack spawn a mini cannon to attack a turret for reduced damage.\n- Orb of Winter. Damage taken over 10% of your max health is reduced by up to X(based on level). This will generate a shield total over time. So if you have 2000Hp. Have 400 shield total. If you are hit for 400 damage twice, half of it will be reduced. But the 3rd hit will deal full damage as you are out of shield total. Upgrades to an active that consumes all current shield total + 50% of the max total to provide a shield for 4 seconds. 45s CD. Cannot use passive while on CD(It will still generate shield total). \n- Guardian Horn. Current items active without the stats. Upgrades to have a passive that grants a MS boost when moving toward champions with less HP than you. \n\n\nFacing a healing team and tried of them clutch healing when you catch someone? GW trinket will help that. \nHate Janna? Pierce them shields.\nPlaying Galio? Pick up a snowball.\nFacing Teemo and no one wants to pick up a sub-par item? No longer a problem. \nHave no tower killing power even though you're winning teamfights? Grab a cannon.\nGetting poked hard? Orb of Winter. \nTeam lacks tankiness/mobility? Guardian Horn.","replies":[{"poster":"Neamean","date":"2015-07-11T06:46:00.297+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The GW Trinket would be a free counter to swain, i mean yes healing is OP but having a way to counter them for free just sucks when you actually get them maybe a GW but it doesn't work on self heal","replies":[{"poster":"Cindikle","date":"2015-07-11T21:55:42.918+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry the idea behind it is that the healing debuff would be removed. Or replaced with the URF one that reduced by 50% but increased by 1% every 30s to 100% at 25min(I think that's how it worked). I know this wouldn't effect Swain as his healing is self healing. But something can be worked out. \n\nAlso the you'd have to upgrade for the active. Since there's only two parts vs SR's 3 it'd be a higher level(10 or 11 likely). By this time most champions already have a Morello's on the team. \n\nOverall I'd like to see healing reworked anyway. \n\nGive every champion \"Gray Health\". All healing is reduced by 40%. Increased back to 100%(66% increase) when it heals gray health. GW can then be changed to reduce the amount of gray health left from their attacks. Reducing the healing they can do, but not reducing it as much to where it's toxic for you if you don't have it or toxic for them if you do. Ignite can keep it's reduced healing though. \n\nSo now the item would apply GW on all attacks(reducing the healing he can do by probably 25%. Then the active can remove the Gray Health you leave reducing his healing to 60% of it's current value. \n\nSpirit Visage in turn can be changed to increase the amount of Gray Health left over by attacks. Although it wouldn't counter the active(which is fine as it's got a CD and only lasts 3 seconds). Picking up SV would mean less damage from him. Currently it's generally better to get more damage for more healing over getting SV. Unless Abyssal isn't enough, which usually it is.\n\nThis change would greatly hurt the effectiveness of passive healing. But would keep the power of reactive healing. \n\nWe're talking Soraka healing for 30% of her current max on a target with no gray health and the 50% ARAM reduction. She'd probably get her %hp cost reduced though to match the healing reduction. 6-7% or so.

In scenario 1). it mean once you get low you stay low which I hope it not what you wanted or 2). where you can heal just not necessarily be top off. Now after reading you comment a second time  I thought what you intended to say was  #2 but at first i thought it was #1 so i just want some clarification. \n\nAlso the Spirit Visage thing kind of confuse me.","replies":[{"poster":"Cindikle","date":"2015-07-12T16:13:59.196+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Say a healer heals 100hp.\n\nThis change would make it 60hp at it's base. \n\nIf the target has recently taken 150 damage. Leaving 75 gray health behind(I don't think this is how Tahm's works but I'm just using the idea not his exact mechanic). The heal will now heal 100 again consuming 40 of that gray health. By the next CD there will be less gray health making other heals weaker. Unless combat is continuing in which they likely will have more gray health to heal. The heal keeps it's current impact when using in combat. But passively it's weaker.\n\nMana costs are reduced by ~20% to compensate(Soraka reduced HP cost instead). This doesn't cover the 40% healing reduction, but they didn't fully lose that healing. Most heals have a fairly hefty mana cost as well.\n\nSV will now increase the effectiveness of gray health and reducing it's decay. For example that 40 gray health heal would become 60 or so. Which would be a 20% increase over the original 100HP. \n\nTricky part comes with GW. If it is just a 50% decrease to gray health that's only a 20% reduction when they still get the full effective in combat. GW is generally used to counter combat healing, not passive. I'd say make it a 50% reduction and increased decay speed. Making it so even quick healing is reduced from the decay as well as the reduction. If the healing isn't done quickly enough they're left with a 60hp heal without SV to increase the duration. Makes healing more about picking the more important target. And more about the right target. If your ADC has no gray health and is at 75% hp. And your tank is at 50% hp with a good sized gray health bar. The tank looks like the better target to heal. If the ADC is lifestealing fine there's no reason to heal them just yet unless they have a threat incoming.\n\nGaren/Trundle/Cho/Mudno will be exceptions to the rule(and similar effects such as Ancient Coin). They will keep their current values but also note they do not effect gray health. These healing abilities are bit different than the rest. Spell vamp and Lifesteal would also get this rule. Although I personally think spell vamp should be reworked to restore based on mana cost with an AP scaling and then adjust other champions who abused it(Vlad, Akali, Morde... well he requires it) around the change. But that's a different discussion. \n\nSoraka's ult will no longer remove GW. But will ignore it and heal it's current value even if there is no gray health. Maybe Janna as well? Although I see her in almost every ARAM game and kind wouldn't mind her getting nerfed. But that's just me seeing her as the source of air that kindles hells fires for Teemo. I'm a little bias. \n\nIgnite will still reduce healing by 50% on it's own.\n\nSomething to also remember is that GW is not common anymore. I think Katarina and Varus are the only two left after MF's changes. Morello's only works if the target is under 40% hp. While these changes may seem massive, currently there is almost no real healing control outside of your mage doing enough burst to apply it. \n\nBut is just adding it to kits and items the right way to handle this? With this change GW is reduced overall in effectiveness in place of healing in general being reduced. I think adding a flask that grants it is a good approach. Perhaps a support item as well that lets them apply it. I remember Dawngate taking this approach(although not limited to them). There were two items that had 100% chance on damage to apply it. Because of this it was generally picked up by the supports and sometimes other champions if it didn't go off their build too much. I think these two would be the best way to bring it. Either someone has to build the items or you buy the flask(which would be cheaper than other flasks and maybe stack). \n\nThis would allow some new interesting heals as well. Say a champion comes out with an AoE heal as a base ability. But it's base healing is shared by all units healed(say max rank heals a max of 300 base, max 100per unit). But it has no reduction on max gray health healing. It's base heal is fairly weak, and almost pointless if you hit enough targets. But if your team just took a big AoE and is full of gray health, it becomes an amazing heal. The max unit heal will not changed on rank, so it doesn't effect early game quite as much. \n\nAfter all of this the only problem I directly see is Swain. Again there currently isn't much to offer in terms of healing reduction as it is. But his healing is constant, enough to heal as fast as he gain gray health. And SV is already a reasonable item on him. Maybe have the birds heal less but make him ignore GW. Maybe a new item that reduces the healing conversion when nearby allies take damage. This would reduce spell vamp, lifesteal and Swain. This would also counter Trundle and Morde's ulti. Not that they would need nerf. This item wouldn't be a large reduction, 20% at most.\n\n\n\nNow this all has me thinking of a new item slot. Aura's. \n\n- Heals nearby allies for 3-5% of the damage you deal with basic attacks.\n- Increases nearby allies MR and Armor by 1-3 for every additional ally nearby you.\n- Reduces MR of nearby enemies by 3-5 when being hit by allies.\n- Reduces the effects of heath leaching on nearby allies by 10-20%.\n- Nearby allies apply Grievous Wounds to targets they attack for 1-3 seconds.\n\nThese cost nothing. But scale if you wait longer to buy them. Otherwise gold must be used to upgrade their stats. For the record though. None of these apply to the champion using them. They only buff allied champions. \n\nGoing to stop there. Getting a bit too off track.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Minarde","date":"2015-07-11T07:18:39.829+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, the GW trinket seems a little iffy.

This means they have a 1/125 chance to get {{champion:161}} , or {{champion:99}} , or {{champion:101}} etc. Assuming there's a pool of about 10-20 champs that are OP in the game mode, that means every person has about a 15/125 chance to get an OP champ. That's a 12% chance for each person to get an OP champ. That may not seem high but every person in that lobby has that chance, so when you do the statistics, it comes out to a 73% chance that _Someone_ is going to have an OP champ. This is of course assuming everyone has every single champ, which they don't. I rarely play ARAM and have a pretty diverse champion pool to play on SR, but my guess is that I have at least a 20% chance of pulling one of those OP champs, and if everyone was like that then the odds would be 90% that at least one of those champs would be in your game. None of this is even taking re-rolls into account, which would stack the odds up even higher.\n\nSo yeah, it's probably a random system, and those odds do add up.","replies":[{"poster":"Jofeyy","date":"2015-07-11T19:16:31.004+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"which is why aram should have every champ available.

I'm guessing that Riot's viewpoint on it is that it would certainly help a bit (~17%), but there are probably better ways to go about fixing the issues that don't involve giving people access to content they haven't paid for, which is not one I can really fault them for. I like your idea because it would give me a chance to play champs I don't own or don't use a lot, but it wouldn't fix the issue at all so saying that they should do it because of balance reasons is poor justification.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Biff Manly","date":"2015-07-10T14:31:02.759+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think Nemesis Draft gave me the feelings of what I wanted ARA to be, at least pretty close.
