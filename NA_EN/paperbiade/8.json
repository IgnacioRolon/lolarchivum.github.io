Lets put things in perspective.\n\nis 1v1 all that matters? is the dmg the problem? the tankyness?\n\nso you know, several champ in league are created to win their 1v1 no matter what. they are called duelists.\nbut, ryze isnt a duelist per se. at least for most part.\n\nmany champs excels at team fight and wont win 1v1s. thats their nature. see, a nasus late game will crush a ryze late game because of their nature, of their kit and how they scale. Ryze scales only thru items, that themselves take a while to bring to strenght. so if his dmg scales of mana, and health takes money to buy and to scale (RoA) then he isnt as strong al lthe time as you say. since he doesnt have the mana: his dmg source, or health: his sustain source. \n\nSo you know, the queens of 1v1s is fiora and poppy. they are meant to win them and thats how it is. good thing we play in a 5v5 environment because that is their weakness.  they need a quick fight with a target. Ryze you see, is none of these per se. tho , he will destroy the adc, not right away, he needs a combo and a half to get the job done, but thats not always enough. he is a late game powerhouse however. but nasus and Sion are the two strongest 1v1 champs kate in the game, Sion being more team fight oriented.
