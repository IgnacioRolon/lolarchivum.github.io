After Rageblade got changed the New trinity Force basically took it's place in Jax's build path. Typically he builds 2 offensive items and then goes for defense, so you go for a Damage item (Trinity or Rageblade) and then another one that gives you life steal (BOTRK or Gunblade). After that you get defense so you can't easily be 100-0'd by a burst mage or assassin, and the active on Gunblade or BOTRK makes you harder to Kite for ADC's. The fact that the items are cheaper than rageblade is just an Added bonus.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"oSEXYPLATYPUSo","date":"2016-09-01T22:10:17.822+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=DeltaRaven,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=0JerWXJ7,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2016-09-01T22:00:44.353+0000)\n>\n> Trinity is godlike on him, but Rageblade is more expensive than something like Gunblade or BOTRK.
