It's more about what you do when you have a lead that generally wins game.

Get good vision, keep pushing out the opposing laner and focus on getting good vision/control of objectives.\n\nADCs can kind of do the same as the top laner to bring pressure to them but after tower or pushing out the opponent, you should go grab dragon.
