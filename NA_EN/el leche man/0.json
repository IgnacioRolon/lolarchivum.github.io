Could you fix this? or help?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-04T00:18:05.035+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even when in a series,  LP is still adjusted with each match.  Looking into this for you it looks like your first series match resulted in a loss, where you went 1/16/15 as Zilean if you'd like to locate that match.  I don't see anything out of the ordinary here!  Let me know if that clears things up!","replies":[{"poster":"El Leche Man","date":"2017-01-16T00:57:35.681+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah it was weird when I lost the game it didn't show the x as a loss, as if I wasn't in my promos but then I played another ranked and it was fine. Just a glitch I guessthanks for responding though :) I'm just bad at this game as  you can tell","replies":[]}]}]}
