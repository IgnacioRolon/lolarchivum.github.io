I'm not very good with programs and anything technical so I'm asking for help. I was wondering if anyone could tell me how to unpin League of Legends from my task bar without it disappearing. When I unpin the LoL client [Not sure if client or patcher; the icon with the yellow \"_L_\" and blue background] from the task bar, I'm unable to find it anywhere on my computer, even in the LolClient folder. Evidently, I'm unable to play league at all.","replies":[{"poster":"Fleance","date":"2016-07-28T23:34:32.886+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It helped a lot!

Not to worry, though, you can achieve replacing your shortcut with the steps below:\n\n1) Unpin the current shortcut from the taskbar\n\n2) Locate your League installation directory (likely **C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends**)\n\n3) Right click on the file named **lol.launcher.admin.exe**\n\n4) Select **pin to taskbar**\n\nThat's it! Let me know if this helped you out.","replies":[]}]}
