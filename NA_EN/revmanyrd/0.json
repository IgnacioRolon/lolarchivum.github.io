This system flags any player who is *inactive* for 90 seconds or longer within the first 3 minutes of the match. If anyone has been flagged, a remake becomes available at 3:00 and requires 30% of the team to pass. If the vote passes, the match ends and those marked by the system will receive a loss penalty and it can trigger leaverbuster if you've had a trend of disconnections. Check out our [/Remake FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/208754686--Remake-FAQ) for additional information on this system.\n\nWhile I cannot modify or remove these penalties, I can assist you in troubleshooting a technical issue if one is causing your disconnections.","replies":[]}]}
