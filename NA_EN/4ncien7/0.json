Afterwards, I spectated his next game &amp; he was doing the same thing (stutter stepping when skillshots were thrown at him, kiting while move/attacking inhumanly, dodging skillshots from FoW).\r\n\r\nThe reason I ask if there is anything else I can do is because this is at level 7 &amp; I doubt newer players will notice these things (or if they do not realize it's scripts).\r\n\r\nI messaged a guy after the game I spectated &amp; informed him about the scripter. He immediately stated he was thinking the same thing the entire game.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-15T21:16:44.346+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Reporting this player in post-game lobby was the best action you could have taken, and it really helps us prioritize who we look at for offenses.
