Unfortunately, I seem to be seeing terrible sportsmanship from 1-2 of the players from each game. Two of them, whom were so similar that they might be the same person, were Katarinas, and I get it. To play at a high level of play, you train yourself to be aggressive. Towards the game and towards others.\r\n\r\nThere just seems to be a lot of players (when I put all 1-2 per game people together) on the brink of rage. Repeatedly taunting their opponents with emotes. Trying to start verbal fights in chat. Blowing up at teammates for deaths, when they've been doing great most of the game. Stuff like that.\r\n\r\nAnd I have thick skin. I know I can mute these people. There are plenty of things I can do on my end to mitigate others' bad behavior, but this post is to add to the stack of posts to bring attention to the poor and vitriolic behavior in League. It just seems like this gaming community (but not specific to League) is breeding a generation of competitive but angry and emotionally immature individuals that explode, whether they win or lose, and they choose to (but it's not really a choice but a bad habit) fight anyone and everyone when triggered.\r\n\r\nBe kind to your fellow players, friends. You will probably never see them in real life, but how you conduct yourself intrinsically matters.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele II","date":"2020-02-06T22:40:55.446+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well I would hope parents get more involved in kids' lives and teaches them about sportsmanship and what not, but no, theyre being raised in environment with complete anonymous strangers with no one to keep them in check and correct them, like a parent would.
