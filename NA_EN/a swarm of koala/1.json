Turns out someone had bought his account; after he recovered it it turns out he had been at least gold (currently plat 4) for the last 4 seasons, and bought a ton of skins and champs.\r\n\r\nThanks stranger!\r\n\r\nStranger is pissed though, he told his friends list he had been hacked and now everyone on his list is sending him angry messages. My friend say's he'll keep them on there for a while because it's hilarious.\r\n\r\nThe main downside here is that he hasn't played for a really long time, and his normal ELO is currently really high, so he's gonna get rocked for a while while he tries to relearn the game.","replies":[]}
