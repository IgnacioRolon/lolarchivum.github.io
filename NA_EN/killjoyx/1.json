Additionally, I think Kindred is currently far too reliant on stacks from their passive. I think they would be much easier to balance (and satisfying to play) if some their power was shifted towards item purchases instead.\n\nOn that same note, it would be nice to have a clearer idea of what I _should_ buy while playing Kindred. It's nice that they can build pretty much anything, but I sometimes find myself saying \"oh god, what _do_ I buy here\".\n\n**===Q===**\nI don't really have any complaints about how Dance of Arrows works. It's good utility, especially when combined with W, though (again) you may fall behind on your Marks and be stuck with no actual scaling for the rest of the game.\n\n**===W===**\nI've tried everything in my power to make Kindred's W an impactful spell, but I just can't do it. To reach 2.5 attack speed (which translates to 1.25 for Wolf), you sacrifice all meaningful damage. Building full AD makes each of Wolf's individual attacks _almost_ relevant, but it hinders Lamb's desire to fire rapid auto-attacks and makes her insanely squishy. The only other source of damage is from Mark of the Kindred, which can be a very unreliable source of power.\n\nI'm not entirely sure what to do with this ability, but I'd like to see Wolf attack faster, more often, and deal more damage. Perhaps you could decrease his scaling from Mark of the Kindred (40% > 10% or 20%?), but allow him to apply on-hit effects or something. With it's current functionality though, it never feels like it's doing anything.\n\n**===E===**\nIn my opinion, Mounting Dread should be renamed to \"Mounting Frustration\". The skill is as feast or famine as it gets, you either land the 3 stacks and deal a decent amount of damage _or the skill achieves **absolutely nothing**_ (aside from a very brief slow). I usually find it very difficult to secure that third hit on a marked target, which makes the skill feel like a waste of mana in most cases. The fact that Kindred generally wants bruiser items rather than attack speed is the primary cause of this.\n\nI would very much like to see Wolf contribute to Mounting Dread in a more meaningful way. Some ideas include allowing him to:\n\n-contribute to the 3 stack effect (increase the total stack requirement by 1 or 2 to compensate)\nOR\n-prioritize targets marked by Mounting Dread while W is active, dealing a small amount of % max health damage on each attack\nOR\n-make Wolf attack on each added stack, dealing more damage on each subsequent attack, with the final one dealing the full % max health value\n\n**===R===**\nAs with Q, I don't have many complains about Lamb's Respite. I'm still pretty bad at timing it properly, but that's due to lack of practice. I guess the only thing I can mention is that it can be extremely impactful for the wrong reasons, the AoE generally becomes a horribly-messy street fight where it can be hard to keep track of everything because of how clumped up everyone is. It's like fighting a J4 ult, but everyone **_wants_** to be in it.","replies":[{"poster":"Aptest","date":"2016-09-16T07:22:48.920+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"====W====\n\nYou are missing the mark.

I'm well aware that Q's cooldown is decreased while W is active, but that doesn't mean that W deals more damage, _it means you get to deal more Q damage_.\n\nAnd, W doesn't deal \"major damage\". W deals 25 / 30 / 35 / 40 / 45 (+ 40% AD) damage which, as I said, is pitiful unless you either A) go full AD _which decreases your overall effectiveness_ or B) have an unrealistic number of passive stacks.\n\nI challenge you to make a build that specifically lets Wolf deal respectable damage as well as attack fast enough to make use of it. Literally all you have to work with is total AD, attack speed (which is _half-effective_ for Wolf), and passive stacks.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"DCYOUNG888","date":"2016-09-16T02:44:31.223+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Then would it be a bad idea to give Kindred 50 extra range on her autoattacks(making it 550)?

I'm shocked.\n\nI'd like to mention a few things...\n\n1)  The nerf to his E a while back took the champion from nitch to straight up depressing to play. Your E was a 3 second slow. If you are unwilling to revert the duration nerf can we please have the AS slow increase with level? That would be one of the best possible buffs which furthers his identity. \n\n2)  I'd really like to see the buff for eating monsters to scale based on either Q rank or R rank. 1% damage on autos at level 16 is not so great. This would further solidify his control style.  \n\n3)  Can we make his absolute zero start as big as it is now or 90% and make it expand a fair bit like anivia?  Again this emphasizes his zone control which again furthers his identity as a control jg.\n\nI'd love any reasonable change to nunu. The biggest problem I had was when his E changed he became markedly worse and it felt like a nerf which made him clunky to play since you cannot engage with RG or flash snowball any more.","replies":[{"poster":"Dino Nuggets","date":"2016-09-16T05:49:45.319+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i completely agree as someone who was trying to make a low elo nunu jg to learn him to play him on my main but what i learned was that no matter how far ahead he can get he just falls off sure you can get your team early dragons but thats all. i feel he isnt worth in team fights if u cant get your ult off after a second or 2. its just meh dmg and the enemy can go on ignoring nunu after his ult. i feel like his w needs a complete rework like if he activates it he does like 5% of his max hp dmg for 5-10 seconds on monsters/minions while half that or 1/3 of that to  champions let him do more than just power up an allies att speed","replies":[{"poster":"LegendmakerGX","date":"2016-09-16T08:06:37.805+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"THANK YOU I thought i was the only one experiencing that.
