Based on other responses, that seems to be how people see it too. Just to add in my views, here's how I personally would break it down.\n\n**Mechanically Complex**\n{{champion:157}} {{champion:268}} {{champion:429}}\n\n**Mechanically Moderate**\n{{champion:421}} {{champion:236}} {{champion:150}} {{champion:222}}\n\n**Mechanically Simple**\n{{champion:161}} {{champion:201}} {{champion:14}} {{champion:432}}\n\nNot too far off from other opinions overall, but I seem to skew toward viewing them on the simpler side. Good to check that sense against yours! Bard is the big outlier for me, where everybody else is putting him at high complexity, so I'll throw in my thoughts there:\n\nI'm looking at this purely in terms of mechanical skill, which I determine from two main questions:\n\n1. How quick/precise do I need to be with my inputs to do the things I want to do?\n2. How many input decisions do I need to make in a short period of time (~5-10 seconds) to do the things I want to do?\n\nFor example, I find Kalista to be mechanically complex because of #1 - she requires a lot of quick and precise inputs to jump where you want (especially as you gain AS). Yasuo is more an example of #2, where you have to make a lot of decisions in a short period of time to move around how you want to and set up knockups.\n\nReally, it boils down to the **moment-to-moment complexity** - how hard is this champion to play in isolation?\n\nBut there's another kind of complexity, which I would call strategic complexity.\n\n1. How much forethought (tracking cooldowns, overall map situation, etc.) do I need to have when playing this champion?\n2. How much do I need to react to other champions, on both teams (their positioning, skills, etc.), when playing this champion?\n\nFor example, Teleport is a strategic spell, largely because of #1. Ezreal, by contrast, isn't too strategic; looking at #2, you kind of don't care who is on either team. You just do Ezreal things regardless.\n\nThis is the **minute-to-minute complexity** - how hard is this champion to play in relation to the game state?\n\nHere's how I would break out these champs in strategic complexity:\n\n**Strategically Complex**\n{{champion:432}}{{champion:421}} {{champion:150}} {{champion:157}} \n\n**Strategically Moderate**\n{{champion:268}} {{champion:222}} {{champion:429}} {{champion:14}} \n\n** Strategically Simple**\n{{champion:236}} {{champion:201}} {{champion:161}} \n\nI think it's the combination of the two that makes a champion \"simple\" or \"complex\" overall.\n\nSo for Bard, I think he's simple on a moment-to-moment basis (mechanical). If you know what you're trying to do (stun that guy, heal that guy, Zhonya's that tower, take a magical journey through that wall, wheeeeeee!), it's fairly straightforward to do them. But knowing WHAT things to do, and when, gets harder. That's the minute-to-minute, and he's pretty complex there. And overall, I think it combines to make an overall complex champion.\n\nSo lastly, here's how I would break them out in terms of overall complexity:\n\n**Complex Overall**\n{{champion:432}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:268}} {{champion:429}} \n\n**Moderate Overall**\n{{champion:421}} {{champion:150}} {{champion:222}} {{champion:236}} \n\n**Simple Overall**\n{{champion:14}} {{champion:161}} {{champion:201}} \n\nWhew.... long wall of text there. If you read through it all, thanks! Remember, this is just my personal point of view. I'm curious if it makes sense, and if you all agree/disagree with any of that.\n\nDo you think we're skewing too far on particular kind of complexity? Is it more of an overall complexity? Other thoughts? Fire away!

Mechanically speaking, Yasuo has:\nQ: Poke that can proc auto attack effects and crits, since mana isn't a management problem, landing it a few times in a row creates relatively simple ranged poke that can become initiation\nW: Blocks particles, used defensively for escapes or safe farming, something useful for a melee champ\nE: Allows Yasuo to position to land his poke, or escape/chase through an enemy's own minions\nR: Does one of the things a good melee champs ult should do, allows Yasuo to initiate for his team or without their help. Without it, he lacks any real way to initiate effectively without a teammate. All he has to do to initiate is land his \"relatively\" simple combo. This also allows for nice synergy with teamates that allow him to ult without even having to land his Q.\n\nTLDR: Yasuo has a high skill floor and ceiling, but this is because his kit is simple an unique enough to be combined into something powerful, albeit more complex.","replies":[{"poster":"KilljoyX","date":"2015-05-07T22:24:42.467+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=jedm180,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=b4Jf0Rq9,comment-id=000f00020001,timestamp=2015-05-07T22:07:21.390+0000)\n> TLDR: Yasuo has a high skill floor and ceiling, but this is because his kit is simple an unique enough to be combined into something powerful, albeit more complex.\n\nSo yeah.

Shield can take a little getting used to but any champion will have a learning curve of some kind.\n{{champion:161}} All skillshots, squishy immobile mage, not simple.\n{{champion:157}} No one thinks Yasuo is even close to simple.\n{{champion:222}} Not super complicated, but toggling Q along with all her other skills being skillshots doesn't put her at the bottom.\n{{champion:236}} Pretty simple; his Q can have some learning curve, but mostly he just wants to do ADC things.\n\n\nAs someone who complains about increasing complexity (though not the OP), I'd say that Braum, Jinx, and Lucian do not bother me on that front, they're simple enough.  All the other champions (even though I love Vel'koz) worry me on complexity grounds; none of them would be a problem if they were alone, but they represent a pattern that I don't entirely like.","replies":[{"poster":"SociopathFriend","date":"2015-05-07T21:54:57.034+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just a nitpick, Vel'Koz is as simple as every other mage that does the same thing. \n\n\"Point and shoot\" sums him up nicely, none of his moves require anymore thought than aim.

Poor Yasuo has such a cool concept, but a few things are just... unnecessary. I mean, think of how much of his power budget could be put towards numbers and scalings if he didn't have double crit, if Flow was an actual resource he had to manage, if his ult didn't give him armor pen, etc. (That last one bugs me the most; it's counter intuitive that the super-cool shrieking anime-dunk doesn't do the killing damage, it just sets up him cleaning up kills with autos and basic abilities.)\n\nBesides the fact that it's hard to balance right, it also sucks for new players going against him. God I remember the first twenty times I faced him as a mage, it felt like 90% of the time I literally couldn't touch him with skill shots. He either wind walled it, dashed to a minion to dodge, and if he can't actually outplay me, don't worry, he gets a Get Out of Jail Flow. Meanwhile, I've been blowing mana on trying to damage a manaless champion. That never ends well.\n\nNow I know how to bait out stuff like that, and he really isn't a huge problem in lane anymore (no more than any AD assassin) but I distinctly remember being on the verge of quitting league because I felt like he was literally invincible against mages.\n\nSpeaking of mages!\n\n{{champion:161}} I started league a long time ago, playing old xerath as my main. Never really was big on league, kind of lost interest. Wasn't that fun, always got my ass beat, lost contact with the friends that played it. \n\nFlash forward to march 2014. I'm in college, meet a lot of new people, turns out they play league. I get back into it, see a tentacle mage monster is on free week, try him out.\n\nInstantly fell in love, been maining him ever since. Vel'Koz is why I'm playing league today. I'm really not in any place to make an objective analysis on him because of that, but holy shit I love Vel'Koz so much for so many reasons I could rant about forever. Really though, looking back, it's nice how simple he was to pick up as a new player. \n\nPassive, land three spells for bonus damage.\nQ, shoots straight, splits in two. Can detonate early. Slows.\nW, shoots straight, does damage twice. Highest damage, no CC.\nE, ground-target, knock up.\nR, go Alderaan on their asses. Slows.\n\nIt took only a few games to understand what his combos were and why. \"Oh, I never lead with W; use Q or E to set it up with CC, and complete the passive stack. Makes sense.\" \"Oh, wow, shouldn't use the E as initiation most of the time, since it's my only real defense.\" \"Oh wow, I'm pretty defenseless while ulting, better choose when and where I use it carefully.\"\n\nAll of the complexity and learning wasn't memorizing a laundry list of mechanics and debuffs; it was emergent, resulting from some very simple abilities. I like seeing this in champs, and I think it happens more often than not. Really, I think Yasuo and Kalista are the only overly mechanical champions you listed.\n\nWell that turned into a long post.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Red Warden","date":"2015-05-07T21:28:46.000+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hard: {{champion:432}} {{champion:268}} {{champion:150}} {{champion:157}} \n\nMedium:{{champion:161}} {{champion:421}} {{champion:429}} {{champion:236}} {{champion:222}} {{champion:14}} \n\nEasy:{{champion:201}} \n\nBarely any of the newer champions are new player friendly.","replies":[]},{"poster":"WolfChases","date":"2015-05-08T16:55:43.939+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Every single one of those is kinda complex.

We can have (what I consider) \"simple\" champions in terms of mechanics (e.g. Sona, Udyr, old Soraka, Sion, Malph). We also have (again, what I consider) \"simple\" champions in terms of how to play them (e.g. Annie, Amumu, Caitlyn, Irelia) because even if the mechanics are not so simple they remain mostly a \"straight forward\" champion once you learn how to play them. You can also have a \"simple\" champion from the perspective of their roles (e.g. Morgana is quite easier to play as a mid laner than as a support IMO; you have to micro manage your cd's way more effectively to have an impact as a support).\n\nSo I guess the contribution I'm trying to make here is to state not only your \"simple\" champion example but also to explain a little bit on why or how you define it as simple. If you ask me Rammus is a simple champion in terms of mechanics, but if you truly want to be effective for your team, even knowing when to select him is as complex as it goes.

They have either point and click abilities, direct abilities, simple abilities and not weird effects that you couldn't understand exactly after trying to play them.
