No one loved the lee sin meta because getting ganked at 3 minutes and then auto losing lane due to snowballing (Losing 2-4 waves) was boring, toxic and basically meant you got to do very little for 20-30 minutes.\n\nThe 2nd worst pre season was also created exclusively by this issue. Feral flare produced the most horrible, depressing, boring meta in league history. Literally the entire game did not matter. It was merely a contest to determine who could get more stacks. Once a Yi hit 70-100 stacks he just couldn&#039;t die. Same with udyr, shyv and tons more. The health of this game, the overall happiness of the player, and the enjoyably of the game is tied to the jungle.","replies":[{"poster":"Leeerzeichen","date":"2016-02-14T18:13:23.541+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":36,"body":"Cinderhulk meta was the worst meta I've ever experienced.

Getting killed in 3-5 seconds means you need to be very far away from the team and out of position to die.

You'll see top-level junglers doing this all the time.\n\nStatements like \"Giving kills to your teammates is what you're supposed to do.\" and \"understanding that you influence the game in a large way while getting none of the credit you deserve is the biggest thing\" just aren't correct. They're way too restrictive. There is a large amount of extremely good jungle play that completely and utterly ignores both of these statements. Using these as rules that junglers have to follow is wrong.","replies":[{"poster":"captainkaiger","date":"2016-02-15T20:02:12.807+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I was using that as a broad statement. Yes, I know that a jungler also needs kills and gold and experience, but I don't gank lanes thinking \"Let's do this for MY benefit.\" If I get the kill, great, got more money than I thought I would, whatever. My main goal is to help out each lane as much as possible, and the fact that I get a good deal of gold and experience from doing it is in my eyes an added benefit of doing that.","replies":[{"poster":"Sightless66","date":"2016-02-15T20:28:06.709+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":">I was using that as a broad statement.\n\nI know, and it's incorrect. The idea that junglers work best when ganking primarily to make their lanes stronger is too restrictive. There are great strategies which are completely contrary to that.\n\n>I don't gank lanes thinking \"Let's do this for MY benefit.\n\nYou totally could though, and many of the best junglers do. Ganking lanes only with the goal of making yourself stronger is a very effective jungling tactic. You may not personally take this approach (and just to be clear, your approach is also perfectly fine), but it absolutely is not a worse way of jungling.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Emperor Time","date":"2016-02-15T20:38:56.703+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"+1 you get me.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Anidan","date":"2016-02-15T01:33:15.245+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I prefer assassin play, but that doesn't mean I ignored objectives or nuanced gameplay.
