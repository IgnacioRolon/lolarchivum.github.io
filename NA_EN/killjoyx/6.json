It allows a champion that's already snowballing to snowball even harder and be rewarded for building glass cannon, on a stat that's already quite versatile. AD is stronger at taking objectives, stronger at clearing jungle, and more reliable in a fight because you get all of that damage on your auto attacks in addition to any spell scaling on AD.\n\nBy comparison, AP only adds 40% to damage on structures, adds 6% to your auto attacks IF YOU GET THE SPELLBLADE MASTERY and otherwise needs {{item:3115}} or {{item:3100}} to apply an AP Ratio (which is 15% and 50% scaling respectively) when auto attacking and if you can't cast spells, the stat is essentially worthless.
