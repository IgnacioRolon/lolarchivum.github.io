Riven damage = 377.3025, garen can use his W, to further increase his defences by 30% for 2 seconds, so 2 aa from rivenbasically are under effect. so the already reduced by armor damage is firther reduced by the skill.

No 2 people are alike in gameplay mechanics or mentally, there is no such thing as equal strength, you are playing to an unrealistic scenario and that's why you aren't agreed with because you are using a scenario that can't exist. If 2 people were equal completely in mechanics, that doesn't stop the other one from simply being smarter or having better instincts. If we had 2 people completely mentally the same, same everything possible, well that doesn't exist.\n\nI can objectively compare power because I have statistics to know who builds what, levels what up, and who wins against who. We don't need to argue math when we can just look and see she loses against X more often then wins. From this we can conclude this X champion does well against her, and being a counter does not ever imply Riven has no chance of winning type of thing, or Riven can't become a victor because get this, an equal skill matchup doesn't exist.","replies":[{"poster":"Dextix LT","date":"2015-07-16T19:52:48.344+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry about the first part. Its getting annoying when i have to rewrite everything for 100 time because someone didnt bother to read....\n\n1) By my damage calculations, riven simply kills garen on the second all in.

IF garen indeeed was a counter to riven he would have higher winrate than he has now, wouldnt he?\n\nAnd about that \"irony\". See i disregard winrate as a stasitic just because you cannot remove variables from it or change them and there are 1000000 of them. The number because of that is extremelly volatile and everchaning.\n\nIn my calculations however, i made sure to controll all the variables like in an experiment. In my calculations unlike those in winrates, extra variables just didnt exist and pure power was being compared.\n\n3) Mate, i once mained garen. I know his match ups inside and out, especially vs riven which was a really popular pick in season 3. That is just what happens in every trade/poke scenario.\n\nRiven wont use her q just to farm a wave, she will save it for engagements or to run away, doing otherwise is bad for her and she wouldnt really do it.\n\n4) In reallity. No. IN calculations however, you have to consider it. WHen you compare a champions power or strenght in comparison to other champions you have to remove all the variables, that includes the human factor.\n\n5) They can, but if either one of them fights in the others minion wave, it will still hurt.\n\n6) I did not take into account summoners because they were an extra variable to be removed and also, most of the time you will see the same summoners there.\n\nWe both know that there is in reality only 1 summoner slot, other is reserved for flash (With some exceptions).\n\n7) I know that equal skill match up in reality doesnt exist. But you cant discuss champion balance otherwise. You just have to remoev all variables, that includes the human factor. This is the only way to compare a champions raw power.\n\n8) Even the statistics show that riven is not countered by garen (win rate above, you can check if you do not believe, site is Champion.gg). And usage of math is like doing an experiment in this case, it gives results and show what happens. \n\nIf garen was indeed the counter to riven.\n\n\n1.

This is comparison of an equal skill matchup.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOkay, lets do some calculations.\n\nRiven is level 3 with plus 15 ad runes starting with longsword. Riven, hp 685, ad 60, armor 29.(base stats). Riven, hp 685, ad 85, armor 29.(Full stats)\n\nGaren is level 3 with plus 15 armor runes starting with cloth. Garen, hp 758, ad 63 armor 31.5.(base stats). Garen, hp 685, ad 63, armor 63.(Full stats)\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRiven skill damage. Q - \"Broken wings\" 10+34*3 = 132 ad damage. W - \"Ki burst\" 50 + 25 = 75 ad damage. E \"Valor\" 90 + 25 = 115 hp shield.\n\nIn the time of garen doing his q/e combo a riven will easily pull off at least 4 aa. Passive - \"Runic blade\" 85 + 17 * 4 = 408.\n\nTotal = 132 + 75 + 408 = 615 ad damage.\n\nGaren skill damage. Q - \"Decisive strike\" 30 + 88.2 = 118.2. W - \"Courage\" Passive already calculated in the full stats and active will be calculated in the defence stats. E - \"Judgement\" 20 + 44.1 * 3 = 192.3.\n\nTotal = 118.2 + 192.3 = 310.5 ad damage.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRiven, defence round. 29 armor = 77,519% incoming damage. Garens damage = 240.7. Rivens shield is unafected by armor so it blocks only 115 damage with no reduction applied.\n\nSo basically Riven will receive only about 180 damage to her hp.\n\nGaren defence round. 63 armor = 61,350% incoming damage. Riven damage = 476.7, garen can use his W, to further increase his defences by 30% for 2 seconds, so 2 aa from rivenbasically are under effect. so the already reduced by armor damage is firther reduced by the skill. Meaning that 204 * 0.61350 multiplied by 0.7 = 87.6.\n\nGaren will receive about 400 damage to his hp.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nResult, Garen, the great riven counter, is unable to outtrade her.","replies":[{"poster":"NemeBro","date":"2015-07-16T12:19:14.621+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":4,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Dextix LT,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=diNfW3Re,comment-id=000200050000000000010001,timestamp=2015-07-16T10:46:40.560+0000)\n> Result, Garen, the great riven counter, is unable to outtrade her.\n\nWell first of all, if I am reading this correctly (and I might not be), your math is wrong. I don't care to actually check if the numbers themselves are accurate, but I don't really feel the need to either.\n\nRiven's total damage when not mitigated by anything is 615, yeah? \n\nAnd with an armour value of 63, Garen would take 61.350% of the damage, right?\n\nThat alone would reduce Riven's damage to 377.3025. Already below the \"400 damage to his hp\" you were talking about, right?\n\nOnly the 30% DR mitigates this even further. Assuming it does indeed only mitigate two autos, that's about 116.40 less damage. So Riven would actually be doing more like 250 damage to Garen. Once more, assuming the numbers you're using are entirely correct.\n\nSo Riven is taking 180 damage, and Garen about 250.\n\nThis is of course assuming Riven gets to unload literally her entire combo on Garen, which seems unlikely considering he can silence it to break it and get free damage on her. \n\nSo in this hypothetical situation that heavily favors Riven for some reason, she takes less damage than Garen. Only Garen is far better able to sustain back any health he loses.\n\nOh, and what about minion aggro? Shouldn't that be taken into account? Were Riven to engage, she would draw it after all. They don't exist in a void.","replies":[{"poster":"Dextix LT","date":"2015-07-16T12:49:50.343+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":3,"body":"Yes, i have to apologise, it seems that i made a mistake in some of my calculations (happens when you have to do 20 of them in such a short time).\n\nSo if we do the correct numbers the damage would be 377 (lets make it so because all those extra numbers are annoying to write)\n\nAutoattack with w reduction is correct as far as i can see.\n\nSo all in all, yes, my calculations were wrong, however yours were a bit wrong too, because after the seemingly right calculations we still have garen taking about 300 damage while riven gets that 180.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAbout the situation itself. Look. This is the best way to see champion power levels in a fighting situation. WIth no other variables. This situation doesnt favor riven, it is just a simple situation in which you can put any champion vs any other champion.\n\nWhile fights do not happen in a void, when talking about balance you have to make situations like these.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNow about the sustain. IT doesnt really matter. You see, for garen to have a lot of sustain, he needs not to get hit for 9 seconds. That is hard to do, especially vs riven. She can combo and combo you over and over again because she has no resources. Yes, garen can drink health pots. But even they wont give enough hp in such a fast time.\n\nLets also not forget that sustainability, while it is a bit of rivens weakness is not such a big deal. She does build lifesteal, early it will be weak, but noticeable. in mid/late game,  that problem takes care of itself. She wont heal like mundo, but it will be enough for trades and staying in lane.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhy i do not count minion aggro and other situations other than a straight up fight? Because that is how you need to look at champ balance and other situations wont really have impact. \n\nMinion aggrro, both of them have aoe abilities. A smart riven/Garen wont initiate in a full wave of minions, however, this brings up another problem. Because in that case they both have to afk farm. In that situation riven straight up wins because she scales better into lategame than garen. Letting garen farm is acceptable, but if you let riven free farm, get ready to be raped.\n\nYou can say that garen will poke her with his q silnece which he has. BUt i know anjd we all know that this doesnt work. In equal skill scenario riven will just w/e and fck over any garen initiation attempt. Poking doesnt work.\n\n\nThis is the reason why i took this hypothetical duel situation, because other kinds of situations just wouldnt happen in equal skill match ups. People wouldnt trade in minions and poke from garen will be mitigated by riven.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhile my calculations were inacurate in 1 part, hypothetical. THere was no other way to do them. I had to simplify them. There can be Millions of rune combinations i just took a simple one. I also didnt take into consideration the fact that they can use different summoners. Which could also shift the power to one side or another.\n\nMy calculations were without riven animation cancelling or cc by the way. SO saying that the situation favours riven is also unfair.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn the end, my point remains the same. Garen cannot outtrade riven. And going more and more lategame, riven gets even bigger power than garen. The so listed many times counter, just doesnt counter her. He can handle her, yes. But in the end he will be beaten, while he may not die, riven will uttrade and just get him out of lane more times, making him lose farm and simmilar things.","replies":[{"poster":"XKjFQBnInj","date":"2015-07-16T13:54:39.027+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":5,"body":"I read most of your posts but I stopped after you said \"In the time of garen doing his q/e combo a riven will easily pull off at least 4 aa\" LOLOLOL yeah lets just unleash our whole combo after Garen silences me. HELLO? IT'S A SILENCE, I CAN'T CLICK ANYTHNG LOL and once he puts that initial damage out, he'll either back off or use his e on me in which I have to run because if I wait to be unsilenced then his q is already coming off cooldown and I haven't even begun my combo, Garen can easily q me, e for a second and then back out without taking much minion damage, if I chase him trying to get off my damage, not only will I take minion damage because my combo is a lot harder and takes more time to do early game, but he might have his q back up again depending on if he's maxing it or not in which case I lose the trade even harder. Also, did you forget about Garens w? He takes reduced damage by 30% and reduces crowd control by 30% when he activates it and passively, he gets 20% more armor and magic resist from whatever he builds. Not to mention if I traded with Garen, his combo is faster, does more base damage early game and he can quickly disengage with his tankiness and speed burst. Also he has a passive that allows him to heal up based on his maximum% of health and I can't ignore minions just to go break his passive and potentially take more damage. The smartest thing to do for Riven is to use her abilities to safely farm against Garen until later level when you're damage starts to scale hard.
