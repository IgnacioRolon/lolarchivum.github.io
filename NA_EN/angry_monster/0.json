Better service? Is it cheaper? Or whole boards are 3rd party system that Riot bought and now the company that made it is also providing maintenance and mods?\n\nIf I'm intruding or prying on some top secret information just tell me so, but I would like to know the answers.

Don't think i've seen any LAN guys post on here though, that or maybe I've just not been there to see it.\n\nSince the company is based in NA then that region usually gets to see some of the stuff first, plus Rioters working on the actual game usually post from time to time as well, and the bug team, etc so they will usually look to NA as far as official stuff as opposed to just using their own region's boards for just community-based things.
