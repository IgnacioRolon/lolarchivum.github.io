As soon as Season 7 started my client has started crashing after every other game. I get to play one then the next as soon as champ select is over, it crashes. And will not let me open up LoL even after i open task manager and close the client. I have to restart my PC every time just to be allowed to open the client back up. It just crashed on me about 10 minutes ago and gave me a loss for my placements, and gave me a warning for leaver buster, and I have never left a game. Can you please take that loss away and fix this issues.
