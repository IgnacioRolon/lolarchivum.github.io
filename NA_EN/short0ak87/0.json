An Ed minion does more damage than a nidalee spear.\r\n\r\nTanky as hell and damage like crazy early seems a bit off compared to other champs","replies":[{"poster":"Thefriendlyorc","date":"2015-03-06T01:50:21.043+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a sion player, it's his only laning tool. Don't stand behind the minions. They are supposedly increasing the cost as it scales. Which will cut a lot of siona power in half as his mana costs are extremely high for how unreliable they are.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FirstSergeantBim","date":"2015-03-06T13:44:53.029+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The only way Sion's E does significant damage is if he builds 21 points in the offensive mastery tree, magic/hybrid penetration runes and lands the minion toss skill shot.  If he builds offense this way, he's fairly squishy, so you need to take advantage of that.  He's also a fairly easy gank if he is overextended without his ultimate.  \n\nLike another poster said, don't stand behind the minions.  Stand to the side or hide in the brush and watch him go OOM.  This isn't rocket science bro, it's that easy.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Juggernaut628","date":"2015-03-06T03:58:24.852+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sion is extremely mana hungry in top lane. Unless you are sitting doing autos all day you should be OOM about 2-4 minutes in the game. And his E does virtually no damage. If anything they should be raising its damage due to it being an AP scaling spell that does about 100 damage on an AD/tank.","replies":[]}]}
