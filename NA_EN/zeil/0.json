Having the same issue this morning.  Tried to play a quick AI Bot game for first win of the day bonus.  Got the black screen of perpetual loading instead of the usual loading screen.  It would stay there forever I guess since it would only go away when I alt+f4 out.  Tried logging back on only for it to happen over and over until the match I was \"in\" ended.  Lost my first win bonus, but decided to try again just to see what would happen.  Same issue of black loading screeen. \n\nMy connection to everything else is fine.  Can go to any site with no problem and log in other online games without issue.  Problem I'm having is LoL exclusive.","replies":[]}]}
