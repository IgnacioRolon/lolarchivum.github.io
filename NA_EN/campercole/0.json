No minions, no towers, just one huge poro in the middle. After a minute the poro drops in the center, and both teams can leave spawn. You can push the poro like the normal ones and instead of towers and nexus there is just a goal. Everyone on your team gets a gold boost when you score, and whoever reaches 'x' amount of points first wins!\r\n\r\nBlitz and thresh could hook the poro and drag him to the goal, or any other champs with ablities. So that means you would have to aim carefully to hit other champs if you're not aiming for the poro.\r\n\r\nThoughts?","replies":[]}
