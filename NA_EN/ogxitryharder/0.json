I may have accidently switched some how, or been hacked. I've contacted Riot multiple times trying to explain the situation but have never got a reply (also the account was made in 2014 so I forgot the email and the password to the email I made it to). Is there a way to pay for riot points (to get it back to NA), that now require euros, when all I have is USDs?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-14T05:01:37.797+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"It looks like you successfully submitted a ticket about this today.

Also I really think you guys should invest in an actual live chat or number to call for support, I'm pretty sure riot makes enough money. I know for a fact they have from me.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-14T22:51:47.531+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can't provide an ETA on when you'll see a reply on your ticket, since that largely depends on how many tickets were submitted recently.
