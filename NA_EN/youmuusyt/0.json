It also benefits from lifesteal, procs Shiv/RFC if it has enough stacks, and it also benefits from Devourer. So tbh I can see how/why it would proc Duskblade, though whether it SHOULD is another story.","replies":[{"poster":"coeurloyal","date":"2016-02-16T21:47:02.836+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's interesting.
