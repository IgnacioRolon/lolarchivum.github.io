I see all the champions teleporting or sliding around. When my hp bar hits 0, I can no longer move.\r\n\r\nThis issue is only fixed by leaving and reconnecting to the game, although it may happen again in the same game. it usually happens in bunches, where it would happen once in a few games in a row, or many times in the same game forcing me to quit. Then again, sometimes I go 10 games in a row without incident.\r\n\r\nI have tried changing all settings to lowest, and checking on a different server, problem persists. I un- and re-installed LoL, nothing. I thought the new client would fix it, nothing.\r\n\r\nDoes this happen to anyone else?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-17T23:16:40.203+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This sounds like you've got a weak connection issue or maybe packet loss that's failing to transmit information smoothly.
