Is. INSTANT._** Or, at least, most* cannot react to it in any way other than prediction.\n\nAll the other \"dash here and knock up in an aoe\" skills? They have a delay. A major delay, in comparison to Malphite's ult. With {{champion:3}} and Rakan, the delay is enough that unless they are cc'ed already or caught in the middle of the skill(or safety is on the other side), they can just walk out.\n\nYou complain about the mobility, but name one other intended support(Le Blanc, Katarina, and Lee Sin are not supports) that has any in-combat mobility. Right now, the most mobile supports are\n\n{{champion:111}} a _**top lane tank**_ that was taken bot in the LCS and has been used there since. Has one mobility spell.(technically should not even be on this list because he was converted to support, not created for it)\n\n{{champion:432}} Speed boost's that either last 1.5 seconds(and briefly interrupt your movements), or are out of combat, and a wall restricted dash that anyone can use(also used more for out of combat rather than in combat)\n\n{{champion:12}} A dash to enemies\n\n{{champion:89}} Skillshot based, dash to enemies \n\n{{champion:412}} Skillshot based, dash to enemies \n\n{{champion:201}} Dash to allies\n\nMeanwhile, in other parts of the rift\n\n{{champion:157}} {{champion:67}} {{champion:92}} {{champion:58}} {{champion:76}} {{champion:121}} {{champion:7}} {{champion:64}} {{champion:236}} {{champion:55}} {{champion:38}} {{champion:429}} {{champion:39}} {{champion:104}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:114}} {{champion:81}} {{champion:245}} {{champion:103}} {{champion:240}} {{champion:203}} {{champion:11}} {{champion:98}} {{champion:3}} {{champion:62}} {{champion:102}} \n\nSo Adc's, Tanks, Juggernauts, Bruisers, Burst Mages, Assassins, and literally every other class of champions can have a champ with significant mobility, but not the class that does the least damage? Please explain why someone who can kill you in a blink of an eye should be allowed to have multiple dashes, but someone that cannot even bring you to half health using their entire kit? \"OH NO, NEVER!\" - You","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-04-10T23:09:43.419+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"So much exaggeration.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2017-04-10T22:42:18.529+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'd argue that it's more like Alistar's WQ combo then Malphite's ult for Rakan.","replies":[]}]}
