AD and AP champions alike have a very strong anti AP item - but only AP champions have an anti AD item. As a matter of fact there is not a single AD+AR item while AP champions get Zhonyas which is strill super strong with arguably the best active in the game. \nSeeing how you are familiar with the concept of the game being balanced around itemization you should understand is that AP champions are balanced not only around Sorcerer boots, but also around their enemy having a MR item. AD champions, however, are balanced around non-tanks not having armor items, but AP champions have Zhonyas granting them an inhernet advantage.\nAnd while that is clearly an advantage for AP champions it's completely fair: the reason for it is probably that the AD midlaners we have counter several mages in terms of 1v1 so hard that they need Zhonyas to simply survive the lane.\n\nThere is no reason to mourn the AD MR itemization, the correct complaint is the lack of AP MR options. Since the Athenes changes AP champions lost an AP MR option which is really awkward for some of them.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Skorch","date":"2017-03-12T10:28:38.926+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"Can tanks get another MR item too?\n\nAnd honestly i think its for the main reason of non-ranged ADs getting onto mages. Assassins mid would be REALLY hard if mages got just as much defense as their opponent while also being ranged. The main issue is ranged ADs using those MR items.","replies":[{"poster":"Gregor Gysi","date":"2017-03-12T11:32:34.019+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"No that would be a super bad idea. The way itemization works is generally to balance out some unbalanced behaviour that occur between differet champion types.\n\nAP champions are very weak against tanks as they have mana costs on their damage and generally don't have much DPS (the exceptions are balanced in their kits and not in their items) so that's why there are only 2 MR items for tanks. If there were more they'd simply ignore mages especially seeing how Void Staff works.\n\nAD (carries) are very strong against tanks due to the high DPS their autoattacks provide which is why tanks have a lot of armor options. The \"new\" last whisper sadly works on bonus armor so that's weird tho.\n\nAD (casters) are much less useful than most mages, but they counter them in 1v1 in midlane which is why AP champions have Zhonyas to survive the  lane. On the contrary there are no AD AR items because they'd be somewhat awkward (should they cater to casters or carries? how will that affect the balance of one of those classes and if we then buffed that class would they become too strong against AP?) so AD is balanced around your squieshy opponents not building much AR.\n\nBTW, have you ever played a tank in ARAM against a full AP team? It's hilarious, once you hit 3 items you are basically invincible.","replies":[{"poster":"Sun Wu Ryuumoku","date":"2017-03-12T15:26:42.654+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">BTW, have you ever played a tank in ARAM against a full AP team?
