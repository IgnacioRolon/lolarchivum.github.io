Without even giving them away to someone else who wants to play them.","replies":[{"poster":"Dynikus","date":"2017-03-05T06:20:17.125+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hate when people don't ask before rerolling, but to answer your question, people play the game mode _for fun_. I find sona, garen, teemo, and a lot of other \"op\" urf champions incredibly boring to play and would rather play someone more enjoyable, even if they're arguably not as good.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ItsOrval","date":"2017-03-05T06:26:38.999+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I reroll people like vlad because i suck with him.

Also maybe they didn't think to ask. It could also be they just wanted to play a different champion.","replies":[]}]}
