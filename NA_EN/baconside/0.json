Is this happening on the updated client?  If so, how are the patcher links functioning on the legacy client?\n\n-  On the login screen of the open beta updated client, look for the \"Launch Legacy Client\" text at the bottom.\n-  Or create a shortcut directly to the legacy client in your League Installation. Just look for \"lol.launcher\"\n\nLet me know if you see any error messages!","replies":[{"poster":"Baconside","date":"2017-01-28T17:46:20.918+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm actually not using the beta. I am hoping that this will also solve some of my other computer problems since this seems to be across most platforms. However, I ran it both as administrator and normally. Neither have worked. That also includes making the shortcuts.\n\n\nI remember that I had an issue called \"Chrome334.exe\" stopped working. This happened a while ago and the google help forums were of no help, instructing me to set chrome as the default for http:// and other links. When done I didn't manage to see any difference and the forum had no other responses for me.\n\nI hope that the League of Legend help will know an answer since I can finally see what is wrong (That being it tries to use links as an application?) \nI'm sorry if this is not the place for this, but it is kinda my last resort, excluding that this is something that seems to be affecting my league client.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-28T18:13:58.034+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The legacy client uses Internet Explorer for assets, so it shouldn't be using anything else.  I'm not sure if any manual modifications were made on your client, but a clean reinstall through the [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) could help.
