I have been wanting to change my VO and in game language to Spanish for quite some time, because I'm taking Spanish in school and it would be some great practice for me.\r\n\r\nI looked this up before I came here, and a lot of places said go to: C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\RADS\\projects\\lol_patcher\\managedfiles\\0.0.0.48 and then ass es_ES or something like that.\r\n\r\nI tried that, and I still don't get the option for Spanish for my language, and I can only chose the north american server now. Does anyone know how to help me here?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-27T15:36:22.301+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Each region has its own set of supported languages, and currently does not exceed that.  NA specifically is set to English at this time, but our full list of region supported languages can be found [here](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751594-Changing-Game-Language).  I would also not advise modifying game files, as doing so would be at your own risk and we couldn't provide support if something were to go wrong.  I do appreciate your intent, and I think it would be cool to have a learn X language with League of Legends characters!  It would certainly make it fun I think.  Anyway, I hope that helps clear things up!","replies":[]}]}
