Not Normal game.\r\nIf even one player gets DC, we automatically loses a game. Maybe we can win. But thats maybe, and this is ranked..\r\nwhat kind of team loses 4 v 5 right?\r\nI mean because of that one DC players, all &quot;4&quot; of us have to ruin our LP. Thats just not fair at all.\r\neven tho we report this player obviously that person is not gonna get reported otherwise he does it in the future multiple times.\r\nI just dont understand why I have to lose cuz of one person getting DC.\r\nobviously everyone gonna say &quot;life is not fair&quot; &quot;People do DC get over with it&quot; &quot;your unlucky&quot; things like that to me but\r\nc&#039;mon thats not the answer to this subject...This is ranked please understand that..\r\nRiot should really just end the game right away when player dont get back in 5 min &quot;during game&quot; not just in the beginning. \r\nThis is really not fair.
