The report covers what went right, what went wrong, lessons learned, and suggestions for future improvement. \r\n\r\nSimilarly, 2-4 weeks after a patch, Riot should create an After Patch Report. I think they should break it down by champions / items, like in patch notes. At the very least, they should let us know what they think of a champion’s state after the changes. For example, for Patch 5.2:\r\n\r\n> Zed: The attack speed nerfs to Zed directly reduced his split-pushing ability by lowering his damage to structures. In an average Diamond-level game, Zed now contributes 5 percentage points fewer to total damage to towers. (That is, whereas Zed used to do 40% of his team’s damage to towers, it is now 35%.)\r\n> \r\n> However, he is still great at split-pushing (and hard to lane against), since his wave-clear rivals that of mana-based mages. At level 7, with a typical item build, he can clear an entire wave much faster than most assassins (such as Akali, Fizz, LeBlanc (if she doesn’t use her ult), and Katarina).\r\n\r\nDepending on what Riot thinks:\r\n> With this in mind, we are experimenting with nerfing Razor Shurikens to only hit the first two targets struck (one for each shuriken?). If this seems viable in internal tests, we expect to be able to roll it out on the PBE for Patch 5.5.\r\n\r\nOr\r\n\r\n> We now think that Zed’s split-pushing threat is balanced by the item options available late-game that nullify Death Mark. His win rate among Zed mains is 51%. (A main is defined as a player who has used Zed in at least 10 of their last 50 ranked games.) However, we will continue to monitor this and report if there are any changes.\r\n\r\nOn the boards, it seems like Rioters are always talking about improving their lines of communication with the community. This is a straightforward way to do so. Since it is a practical analysis, I think it would clarify the values and metrics that Riot using to judge itself.","replies":[]}
