One chest for personally getting an S, and one chest for someone else in your party getting an S?\r\n\r\nContext: So I often play League with my sister and her boyfriend. She plays relatively few characters. For ADC, that's Miss Fortune and Jinx. Last night, I was playing Thresh, she was playing MF, and her boyfriend was playing Heimer. The match was going okay, but she wasn't really on track for an S grade, and she told her boyfriend, \"you better not get an S,\" because she wanted to earn the S on MF and get the chest herself. Well, instead, I managed to get an S. (I didn't think I was doing that great, but whatever.) So she was a little disappointed now that she couldn't earn a chest for herself on MF.\r\n\r\nAnd now, just tonight, she played Jinx. I played Garen, got a S-. And you can hear in her voice how disappointed she is. She says \"well, guess I can't earn a chest on my ADCs now.\" I try to explain that she can still play Jinx and get an S and give me and her BF a chest, but she says she doesn't care about that. I explain, okay, well, you can get chests on other champions, like Malz or something while I play Garen or whomever. She's not satisfied with that either.\r\n\r\nI think it's an issue of personal pride, of feeling like you are earning something. So you don't feel like you got your chest handed to you on your best champion. I can sympathize.\r\n\r\nMy proposed solution would be that you can earn two chests per champion per season. One chest you can get for personal performance alone. The other chest, you get based on anyone in your party's performance.\r\n\r\nI guess it would take a little bit more design work on the client GUI to make it clear which champions you've personally won a chest for, and which you just got a chest for due to someone else's performance.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, the max chests you can earn per year are 4 x 12 = 48. But you need 48 different champions to do that. With this scheme, you would only need 24 champions. I think this would be a beneficial side effect, but if it's Riot's plan to encourage new champion purchases with this system, then this idea wouldn't be so good for that.","replies":[{"poster":"TheRealSherlock","date":"2016-03-27T04:26:02.056+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, it's really a good idea but it would be better that you can earn up to 4 chests per month on the same champion if someone else in the team get's an S.
