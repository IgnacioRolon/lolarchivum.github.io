These are a staple of every game:\n\n- 90% of the time, you have to force someone to support. That person ends up picking a non-support usually and still doesn&#039;t want to support. The lane then becomes a 1v3 for the adc as he has to fight two opponents plus his own teammate who wants to take kills and take as much cs as possible. Since I&#039;m getting put with a lot of unranked players, they don&#039;t know anything about the game and take it personally when I ask them to not take CS or kills. It leads to reports, people abandoning lanes, group bullying and a host of other bullshit.\n\n- AFK&#039;s and DC&#039;s are a staple of every game. This happens in the majority of my normals games and it&#039;s really frustrating. You can almost guarantee that you will be playing 4v5 at some point in normals.\n\n- There&#039;s a huge gap between people playing for fun and people playing to win or practice. You get people who don&#039;t give a fuck matched up with people who care. It leads to reports and extra toxicity.\n\n- Stupid picks are pretty much a staple of the mode due to the people who don&#039;t care. I&#039;m pretty sure I&#039;ve seen just about every champ tried as a support at one time or another. Great for the people who don&#039;t care, bad for the people who do.\n\nNormals games aren't any good type of training for ranked. I do about 1/3rd as well as I do in normals as I do in ranked.\n\nI also want to say that &quot;go play ranked instead&quot; really isn&#039;t the solution here. There&#039;s specific reasons I go normals over ranked. It might be to play different champs and sometimes its because I want to play but I&#039;m mentally done for the night.\n\nI don&#039;t know what the answer to fixing some of these issues are other than creating a fun mode and a serious mode for normals, but I wish something could be done. I know a lot of people get reported due to the bad environment that is created and I know I leave normals games most of the game regretting playing.","replies":[{"poster":"Skia Asteri","date":"2016-11-01T03:08:02.524+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Flex and Solo/Duo Q will be separate rank queues  next season; pick one to use for practice and one to seriously climb.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2016-11-01T02:46:05.481+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually sympathize with this, but I also don't see what can be done. Normals are used for both practice and fun, but those goals can't really coexist since a game where people aren't really trying doesn't really serve as practice any more than bot games do. I can't really see making a \"serious normals\" and a \"fun normals\" mode working either.\n\nOne thing I've decided to do next season is to have a practice smurf account so I can experience the competitive, serious rank environment without having to worry too much or putting my main rank in jeopardy.\n\nI wonder how much it would bum me out if I turn out to rank better in my smurf than on my main.","replies":[]}]}
