Is saying EZ after a game ban worthy or not?\n\nIf it&#039;s not reportable, I&#039;m not sure why. Saying EZ after a game is clearly unsportsmanlike and negative. This wasn&#039;t used very much when I started but is now happening every game, regardless of whether you won or lost. And not only is one person doing it, but multiple people are as well. You see League players are the special kinds of people who can&#039;t be satisfied with winning a game, even if they dominate it. They need to go that extra mile to pour salt in the wounds and aggravate players. One of the worst feelings in this game is when you really put out a good performance but you lose and someone still has the audacity to say \"EZ\" after.\n\nIf it&#039;s reportable, I&#039;m not really seeing much done about it. I&#039;ve reported for over 100 EZ&#039;s alone this year and I&#039;ve seen no messages saying someone was punished. Yeah sure, &quot;they&#039;ll get punished if they do it frequently enough&quot;, yeah and I&#039;ll rival Faker if I CS better.  That&#039;s not good enough and it sends an awful message of - Do whatever bad thing you want to do in game, just don&#039;t do it frequently. It's also saying \"hey, don't even bother reporting it, because we aren't going to do anything about it, but don't you dare reply back because that'd be toxic\".\n\nSo what&#039;s the status?","replies":[{"poster":"Prandine","date":"2018-07-09T23:22:37.797+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"While Necromancy may be handy (and sometimes needed) in video games, it's not the case for old forum threads.

And unsportsman-like conduct and general behavior is punished and if not on the court, punished in the eyes of the public opinion. It can result in sponsorship or endorsement loss ($$$) and even implicit blacklisting. In the case of behavior, look at how both Teebow and Kaepernick had their careers effectively ended because of their behavior. Both were considered distractions, regardless of how positive or negative that distraction was considered, either internally or to the public.\n\nThink of the history of each sports and all time greats. Jordan, Gretzky, Pele, Ali, Woods. For all their occasional bluster on the court, it was never about \"shit talking\" in the manner you're referring. The stories that you hear about shit talking that get out are all funny ones.  \n\n* Telling an opponent what you're going to do, and daring them to stop you, but they don't because you're a better player.\n* counting down from the start of a game how many points you're going to score\n* styling etc..\n\nThey might refer to losses as abnormalities, luck, etc... But it was never \"man, they sucked, we just steam rolled them\" or \"What an easy game.\" Players even the antagonistic ones like Maradona don't line up at the end of a game and shake hand and tell the opposing player \"man you guys sucked.\" There were pundits to do that for them.\n\nHumility is a huge deal in sports. Think about how much more Lebron, Tyson, or Ronaldo would have been beloved by fans and sponsors if they were more humble. League actually has a great example of its own. Think about how much more DoubleLift would have been beloved earlier in his career if he was more humble.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/8ef6PAoMJgg?t=1h9m3s\n\n[Look at the commentary by Jatt and Kobe on DoubleLift after the championship.](https://youtu.be/8ef6PAoMJgg?t=1h9m3s) \n\nIn esports, you may be unsportsmanlike, and walk away from the game and play another anonymously. Try saying those same things at your local basketball court, rugby field, football field, soccer pitch, etc... and you'll find yourself quickly isolated. I bet toxicity in esports [much less the internet] would take a nose dive if you had to make real names and your address for every username publicly available (not that I'd want to). Anonymity isn't a free license to be uncivil or at minimum act with a modicum of maturity. \n\nIt's one bloody match, so it was easy, big deal. There's no reason to actually say it. Unless you think you basically won against new players who don't realize they played poorly. And if that is the case you have to point it out, that's not a particular compliment to your own intelligence or skill. Because if they aren't smart enough to realize they played poorly, you've basically one a game against players who can't put cause and effect together. If that's the only game you're winning easily, that's more of an insult to yourself.","replies":[]},{"poster":"EvilDustMan","date":"2017-04-06T22:04:13.865+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MUSHROOM MIDGET,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=EnunvHEJ,comment-id=0002000100000002,timestamp=2017-04-06T21:39:40.761+0000)\n>\n> i like you tantrum but i think you are making a big mistake here.\n> \n> trash talk in competitive games like LoL helps give the game an edge.  i love it if my opponents are trash talking me.  it fuels me and makes me play harder.  it makes the game matter more.  \n> \n> when the other team is being all polite and nice i barely care if i win or lose.  its much more boring.\n\nOkay.

I've very rarely met a player that says only \"ggez\" and nothing else. If someone says ggez, they could also be joking, especially since a lot of times they say it when their nexus is exploding. But ggez is not on my top ten list of things to report on. It's usually the other stuff they say before ggez. The only difference I can see between taunting your enemy and ggez, is that taunting your enemy could technically be a winning strategy, causing them to perform worse than normal, and tilting them, thus tilting their entire team. Whether or not this strategy is supported by Riot, I'm not entirely sure, but ggez is not really a strategy, since you've already secured a win. All in all, I find the entire matter very complicated.","replies":[{"poster":"fatherdarius","date":"2017-04-09T16:35:43.005+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"I've found taunting 'in character' to be far more satisfying than taunting the other summoner.\n\nFor example if you're {{champion:84}} and you kill the enemy {{champion:267}} : \"Good blade-work makes for excellent sushi\"\n\nOr when you step in {{champion:51}}'s trap as {{champion:33}}  and you take hardly any damage from her auto: \"You call that a head shot?
