Matchups are one of the easiest things to get the hang of if you are an intelligent player. Figure out how their champion's trading pattern works.\n\nFor example, Graves top verses a melee with a gap closer.\n\nGraves is ranged and has burst, vision denial, mobility, and resists. So he's a bit of a ranged bruiser. However, he has very short range and his auto attacks can be semi-mitigated by minions. In addition, his ammo system makes him vulnerable after he uses both of his shots.\n\nSolution: In order to win this lane as a melee champion, you want someone that can jump in, deal some damage (preferably really good burst), then dip out to mitigate counter harass. Champions that favor extended trades with auto attacks will struggle because Graves will have enough time to get his auto attacks and dash up in order to out trade.\n\nSo Jax, Renekton, and Wukong can excel against Graves.\n\nJax can Empower-Leapstrike (WQ) into auto for 3rd damage proc (if lvl 6+) and then go for extended all in with E due to it's unique safety it provides, or use it as cover to prevent damage return. Ulti also useful to help prevent raw damage from bursting Jax.\n\nRenekton has a shit load of damage and two dashes, making it fully possible to quickly jump in, nuke, and jump out to help mitigate the return trade. He also has natural sustain and innate tankiness to help prevent bursting.\n\nWukong can dash in with EQ and nuke Graves, though not as effectively as Jax or Renekton, but can safely disengage with W. Mana intensive, but can scale into late game harder than Renekton (Who falls off), but not as hard as Jax. Makes up for it with his passive giving him resists and having way better teamfight presence than either of them.\n\nSomeone that's bad against Graves is someone like Riven.\n\nShe's innately squishy and her gap closers that are also tied into her damage are also mitigated by Graves' dash, which also helps prevent her execute because it effectively mitigates her damage twice (Initial damage, reducing % missing, then the % missing reduction on the phys. execute) - He can simply dash away in order to get reload and deal very significant damage when she attempts to flee.\n\nThese are just bare examples of matchup specifics, and of course jungle intervention and individual outplays and misplays can go into account.\n\n> \n> There&#x27;s no universal level of game knowledge, it&#x27;s very possible to be at least somewhat ignorant of the game no matter what your level. Some Bronze players know a lot but don&#x27;t know what to do with that knowledge, but not all.\n\nIt's most common for bronze level players simply to be just *bad.* They think they know more than they do, so that and their attitude keeps them there.
