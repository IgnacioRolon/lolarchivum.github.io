Instead, in three seperate games today, the 3rd person decided to go on his own. Taking a 7-10 minute bot game into a 20+ minute clown fiesta where the bots end up more fed and end up wrecking, because the 2 people who went bot end up splitting cs/gold/xp while the enemy gets an adv.\n\nThis community is just unbelievable at times.","replies":[{"poster":"Awkward Couch","date":"2016-11-03T19:42:12.421+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"You mean some people who are pre 30 don't know how to play the game and want to try something else out?

Sometimes you want to figure things out for yourself. It's part of the experience.\n\nYou're playing bot games with legitimate new players, you have to expect that some of them won't have all the game knowledge you do, or even want to do things the way you think they should be done. If you want to level a new account, find some friends and grind the games together.

You hide in bush to get first blood. All 3 have to be there. Otherwise, the enemies hit 6 first and powerspike before you, and usually it's going to be an ADC. You have to have all 3 so that you can overcome the loss in XP/gold.\n\n2) You TP on cannon minions to save them from dying and can take the first two turrets in about 5 mins.\n\n3) You don't die \n\nYou do this right, you win in 7-8 mins. You fuck up? 20 min game and possible loss depending on the team comps. Champs like Brand can fuck up an entire team because they are levels ahead and have a ton of CC. We also tend to pick ADC's as they can hit from further away but if someone like a Brand or a Graves gets fed, you get 3 hit. Also, most people doing this are under level 20, we are already naturally weaker.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Dorans Shuriken","date":"2016-11-03T20:19:44.177+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Great Muta,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=UWEx1iAq,comment-id=0001000000000000,timestamp=2016-11-03T20:05:49.538+0000)\n>\n> We&#x27;re here only to grind up.

Both bot laners should be picking ADC's already to get this done faster. However, the bot is going to get extra xp from the 2v1.
