This went on for 2-3 weeks straight. Tons of posts on reddit with people having the same issue.\r\n\r\n    Things cooled off for a week. I even remarked how the troubles may be solved.\r\n\r\n    Now, some of the worst ping I've ever had. Even at 1PM, it won't go under 100. At nights, I'm looking at 200-2000 easy. I've had to surrender multiple night time games just because it is impossible to play. I can't even stream my games anymore because the ping will go up even higher.\r\n\r\nI had none of these problems before the move and I've made no computer, hardware or internet changes since the move, but things just get worse and worse. I'm in Pittsburgh on Comcast High Speed internet and everything else is working fine.","replies":[{"poster":"RoosterDaddyio","date":"2015-10-23T01:22:14.854+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're not the only one.

Here in michigan I used to get maybe 100 all the time, now it's a grand 30 max, 10 minimum. I had horrid ping for the longest time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sassmast3r","date":"2015-10-23T02:30:53.395+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For me, having high ping isn't my issue; I'm totally fine with having a constant 110. What frustrates me is the _lack of stability_. The fact that it fluctuates from 90-250 constantly is what pisses me off. I know for a fact my ping SHOULD BE 90-100 constant, which is wonderful, but instead it's super random and makes the game more frustrating then entertaining, which is what a game is intended to be.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hawkmed","date":"2015-10-23T00:23:10.734+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"having the same problem , I've been posting everywhere and still no reds to help us out","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dark Morgana","date":"2015-10-22T22:41:13.915+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hello Great Muta, \n\nI was having same issues and I tried Riot's Connection KB and it fixed the issue right up; https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues \n\nGive that a try and if it doesn't work, I'll be on for awhile so reach out to me if it doesn't seem to help :) \n\n{{champion:25}} {{summoner:4}} {{item:3157}}","replies":[]}]}
