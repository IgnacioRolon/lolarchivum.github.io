He skips frames while walking around his W buddy, and in addition to that pool party Taric has this flickering VFX.","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBJMf3Yazt8","image":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RBJMf3Yazt8/hqdefault.jpg"},"up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I know this has been posted before but I wanna try to draw some more attention to it. As someone who plays Taric, it's been an issue for months and can really detract from the fun of playing Taric. Essentially, whenever you link to someone with your W, about every 3 seconds Taric will frame skip on screen. It's fairly obnoxious especially during the laning phase. Hopefully a fix will finally come!","replies":[{"poster":"DumberThoughts","date":"2017-11-02T21:40:04.180+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Riot KateyKhaos, \n\nI posted a previous message about Taric in Report a Bug... But in case this catches your eye I'll mention it here...  I believe there's a bug with Taric's E where the spell doesn't activate immediately upon pressing E the way it used to.  Currently when I press E, I have to hold my mouse cursor in place for a brief time (~.5 seconds) before his stun animation activates.  If I press E and move the mouse cursor immediately, the spell will never activate.  It results in many botched attempts to cast E.  Can you look into that, and see if the same thing happens to you, and see if it happened in older patches?  I play Taric a lot and this just started happening to me in the past couple weeks.","replies":[]},{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2017-10-09T21:19:45.462+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey SgtPepper3608 - \n\nI looked through our bug catalog, and this issue was verified as fixed on June 15th, which would have been patch 7.13.

The Taric W bug is still happening, and it seems to be affecting many different people however not everyone?\n\nI've made a post about this as well a while back, but didn't receive any feedback (This is the first Rioter comment I've seen actually). \nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report/IEf8y9BF-gameplay-taric-visual-bug\n\nFor me personally I'm using an nvidia GTX 750 Ti graphics card, and apart from this bug, the game runs perfectly fine. Plus I can play other games that are much more visually demanding with no problems as well.\n\nI'm not sure what the cause for this effect is, especially as it doesn't seem to affect everyone. Reading this comment thread I see that both the OP and myself have nvidia GTX graphics cards, although different models, and perhaps that's the common link? At any rate, anything that can be done to look further into this and maybe give some insight in a future QA or something would be really helpful.\n\nThank you~","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lucky Moniker","date":"2017-10-06T19:42:07.625+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looks more like a latency issue to me but Iâ€™m no expert","replies":[{"poster":"Pyke Wazowski","date":"2017-10-07T05:34:29.904+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh no that's totally what I thought at first too, but after searching around multiple people have the exact same issue only with Taric's W.","replies":[]}]}]}
