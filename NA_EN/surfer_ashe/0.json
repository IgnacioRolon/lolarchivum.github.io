As for pink wards, it's hard enough to encourage your team to buy it and since it's limited to 1 per person you can't do it alone. Even if you actually do find him with a ward, still annoying to deal with since he has a really high movement speed from Ultimate + Trophies + {{item:3142}}  + the range he gets from his jump from stealth/bush, even if you saw him coming he'll probably still be fast enough to run past your team and jump and instant kill your adc.","replies":[]},{"poster":"S3ntinel","date":"2016-01-04T18:04:11.962+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"But that would require *low whisper* teamwork!
