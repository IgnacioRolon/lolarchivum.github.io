My name is Trevor, 19, freshman in college. I have been playing league of legends since s5 maining the jungle role{{champion:76}}   and absolutely adore this game. A few days ago I was assigned my first writing assignment in my English class and I have to write a story/paper talking about my desired profession and what someone in that profession does/how they like it/things they don&#039;t like/etc. One of the requirements to get this information is by interviewing someone in that field. I want to go into developing games or something along the lines of that and since LoL is one of my favorite games I thought it would make since to see if I can interview a Rioter for my English project.\n\nI wasn&#039;t sure what the best way to contact a Rioter would be so I sent out a few Twitter DMs and posted this here. Hope that is alright!","replies":[]}
