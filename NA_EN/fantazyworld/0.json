I found out it was syndra, but she had still bought  items. \r\n\r\nIs that even fair? I got 0 LP for that, wasting like 30 min for finding a game and champion select. Got almost double kill 3 miutes in  which is gonna help us win the game by alot.","replies":[{"poster":"Deflum","date":"2016-07-06T17:29:05.474+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"a remake is when the player has disconnected. the Syndra may have bought items, but if she disconnected afterwards, they still have the option to remake, which puts everyone back in que for another game (in a higher priority I assume, but riot will have to comment if that is the case.) in all of my remakes I've seen I had que pop soon after I was replaced in it. Sorry it affected you negatively, but for the other team, it saved them from a 4v5 and a poor game experience. All I can say, is try to think of it from their point of view. You may have almost got the double, but to them, It was already a lost game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gunslinger744","date":"2016-07-06T17:32:28.451+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They may have re-made moments before you got the kills. You know, like how a surrender vote sometimes takes a second to register. It sucks, but you'll be grateful for it when you can use it yourself.","replies":[{"poster":"FantazyWorld","date":"2016-07-06T18:46:22.470+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i have already used it :), but i am sure that syndra would be back in some minutes. i almost never have someone that is afk for the whole game, usually they come back. That Have happend to me before, that i need to maybe restard lol/my pc or something. \n\nBut i still think the \"winning team\" should get something, like 5 lp. Since the loosing team dont loose anything anyway (except the AFK). \n\nI still think there is bigger problem, like when people go afk under a game, like 25 min in game, you have won you lane your team is doing a great, and someone decide to afk which is making the enemy team getting a free win.","replies":[]}]}]}
