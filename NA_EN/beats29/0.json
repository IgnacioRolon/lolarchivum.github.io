She is weak early and it's very, very easy to abuse this.\n\nI also don't understand your reasoning here.  You say that you run over all the times you could have dodged Amumu's Q but not Sejuani's?  If Sej doesn't hit you with her Q she's very easily kited, same as Amumu, unless she wants to ult you, which is sometimes quite good because it means she's not ulting your entire team.  \n\nAlso, you realise spreading works against both of those ults, right?

Amumu needs to be close, Sej doesn't this makes a HUGE difference. Yes spreading works against both, but with Sej you typically need to get your adc right out of the way, while your front liners keep sej back (though she can barge passed) amumu on the other hand, it's easier to surround him, bait out his ulimate or box him out from your carries. Because of this, even though both are \"similar\" it is much harder to stop sej then it is to stop amumu. Also, counter jungling comes down to the jungler. The ones banning will only be jungle like what, 1/5 times (in higher elos probably more), so they just know sej wrecks their lane, not whether they can counter jungle.\n\nPut simply, in laning phase, sej ganks can be so much more painful, and she has more \"approach\" options because of her free dash, plus she can slow without wasting her ultimate. Amumu uses his ultimate, people immediately say \"amumu's ulti is down\" so he isn't much of a threat for a minute or so, his gank speed is just slower and more dependant on the ultimate.\n\nIn team fights like I said, Amumu can be boxed out, I've seen one try to tunnel down an adc, land his ulimate, only to see he has no HP left by the time he gets there. Sej doesn't need to get as close, and gets there easier, making her more dangerous a champ when played by people who are not as good with her","replies":[{"poster":"mvargus","date":"2015-04-21T14:02:06.801+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You do realize that Sejuani is no faster than Amumu and her Q is shorter range.  Yes she can use it over walls even without a target while Amumu's Q has to hit a target to pull him over a wall, but the idea that Sej is a better ganker is a bit absurd.  I have more success with Amumu than I do with Sej.  You hit Amumu's Q even at level 3 and it usually means a dead ADC or Midlaner.  I've Q'd in as Sej and ended up focused and dropped in bot lane as the knock up doesn't last long and usually the other team will focus before the W can start dealing damage.  With Amumu you can turn on his W before hitting Q and the damage starts the instant the Q lands.","replies":[{"poster":"Apollocliptic","date":"2015-04-21T14:13:45.158+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Amumu can reach a lane faster (like if he goes bot or top) but in reality, if you need the max range of Q, then it's a risky gank to begin with, and I've played against amumu, and easily protect the ADC from his ganks, then tank my way to the turret. But Sej on the other hand can slow you and the adc, meaning if she times her ganks better (not just zip lining from an easy distance) escaping is SO much harder without flash, and she can save the knock-up to secure, not initiate. Like with leona, I often use zenith blade, then let my adc hit theirs while i walk towards enemy turrets. If the enemy adc tries to fight back, I can stun, and W kicks in, if they try to run, I can still stun, unless they flash, then they burn flash and play safe for the rest of the time.\n\nAmumu can make single super plays, but sej is more consistently reliable and therefore harder to play AGAINST. I am not down on amumu, I ban him still in some cases, but he is easier to box out than sej, not because of speed, but just general presence. AOE slow makes big difference, anytime free dash makes big difference, and I believe the CD is shorter too than amumu's Q. Because I have been ganked by amumu, still killed the enemy adc and escaped, or had him dive, and we both die (adc double kill), whereas Sej rarely ends up dying under turret like amumu does a lot, and protects adc as well as attacks, amumu only attacks.\n\nALso, amumu's kit is designed to work better if you fight back (like taric for example) AOE that cd faster if he's in combat, AOE % dmg, short range melee. If you ignore him, you take less damage from him, sej does not have that weakness, if you ignore her you are still taking her max damage and greater cc.\n\nAGAIN I respect amumu, but sej is harder to play AGAINST not saying who is stronger, just who is harder to counter.\n\nTo be honest, I have a harder time against amumu when I am mid (no ulti's included) but cause I am squishy as fuck and if he lands that stun you're dead. But bot has a support, and top has more time to see him coming and therefore escape - forcing him to use his stun early, and often you escape. (unless opponent intelligently forces an engage and locks your attention away from him)\n\nSej's slow means that once she closes the distance on a top laner, the losing opponent can get involved easier, (worse if they were winning) so it depends a bit on lane too","replies":[{"poster":"Apollocliptic","date":"2015-04-21T14:14:38.936+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When I play mid and enemy uses sej, I rarely worry at all, unless she ulti's me, which nothing i can do there but hope to flash escape, I can just keep vauge awareness of her location.

She doesnt have quite the range, but makes up for it by using her Q to escape and E to kite. she also isnt as mana hungry. her ganks also dont rely on a single-target skillshot, so its easy to hit with a flash. pre-6 if that skillshot does hit, she can follow it up with a slow. amumu cant.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kingsgrave","date":"2015-04-21T04:36:14.666+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"sejuani doesn't have to be right on top of you to ult and is an actual stun\nsejuani has free to use mobility that doubles as CC thats easier to land than Amu Q\nsejuani has everything amumu has and more","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kamai","date":"2015-04-20T21:39:35.825+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Sej might be overstated, that's hard to say.
