For ranged champions Ivern's Q won't move you closer to the target enemy than your max attack range. From memory melee champions use a slightly different calculation to ensure they're generally put in a useful spot.","replies":[{"poster":"redfeenix","date":"2016-09-21T03:03:28.595+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Seems interesting, you're gonna have a hell of a time balancing him eh ?","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2016-09-21T03:29:33.140+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe? There are quite a few other champions that effectively allow their team to get onto a target though, often with higher reliability (Sivir, Zilean, Thresh, Morg, Blitz etc), so while the Q's definitely powerful it's got a fair number of counterparts I'd argue.","replies":[{"poster":"redfeenix","date":"2016-09-21T03:45:26.708+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fair, but I meant Ivern in general. These type of super unique utility based champs have very powerful abilities, and are even more powerful when put together. \n\nFor instance, did you have challenges balancing Bard? He seems in a great spot as of late, but was he OP / UP at the start? \n\nI think Ivern has the potential to quickly snowball and become Hella OP. I trust you will ensure that he doesnt become a toxic perma ban in our games :)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"CerealBoxOfDoom","date":"2016-09-21T03:01:21.140+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Your memory or the melee champion's spaghetti code memory?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Zero Skill Tank","date":"2016-09-20T22:02:03.922+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"At the vid, Ivern is placed directly at enemy who he clicked on, not at 125 units :(","replies":[{"poster":"TyrekGoldenspear","date":"2016-09-20T22:18:02.785+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well that's because Ivern is melee if he isn't in brush, so he has to be that close to hit them. :)","replies":[{"poster":"Zero Skill Tank","date":"2016-09-20T23:04:44.441+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, he doesn't.
