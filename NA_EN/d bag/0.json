CEOs have been kicked out of their own companies for doing stupid things, like sexually harassing their employees.\n\nI made a thread some months back about when it's okay to be an asshole. Simply put, it's never okay, no matter if you're a bottom tier player or an LCS champion. I've experienced in real life the consequences of a loose tongue; consequences that led to one person's mind snapping like a banjo string, a head injury that landed me in the hospital and being taken out of school for my own safety. It made me very conscious about what I say and how. \n\nOne the major problems with people nowadays is their lack of control over their own language, and it's an issue that goes beyond Dunkey. I've been around people who regularly drop F and N bombs like it's London 1940, make death threats and character attacks as general banter, or just plain old don't spell correctly. Language is one of the few ways we are perceived over the internet, and it is the most common way, more common than all the Twitch and Youtube videos combined, and it's one of two ways we're perceived over a game of League. There's already enough toxicity and negativity in League; it's not Riot, but the community that has created this atmosphere, and one that has made me consider leaving too many times. \n\nMuch like real life, if you start being a bastard, you're going to be put in the timeout room for a while. You may not like it; tough! It's called discipline, and too few of us possess even one iota of it, be it behavioral or linguistic.","replies":[{"poster":"Dgin","date":"2015-09-16T05:33:00.704+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":4,"body":"If trashtalking is illegal, then count me out. League is made for people to trashtalk as hard as they can. It is well known for it's toxic and savage players, and that's not such a bad thing ITS MAKING THE GAME MORE FUN, NOT DESTROYING IT. Although there's a difference between being an asshole in real life, and being one (playfully) in a game of league. Nothing is personal, Dunkey quit because League has become such a pussy game, where there's trolls everywhere and theres nothing you can do or say about it, or you get banned. The thing is, that Malphite is still playing league and trolling with no consequences, and that's why I quit. The system is so stupid, that it seems to FAVOR trolls and afk's, and the actual players who really want to play a serious and legitimate game of league seem to be at a disadvantage. I have gotten permanently banned for this reason. I just couldn't seem to find a game where there are no afk's and trolls on my team or the enemy team. I got frustrated and flamed our troll teamate, and he simply told lies about me on the enemy team and screenshot my chat and got me banned.

Correct me if I got the memo wrong. Tbh, I would say doesn't matter if you're a long time supporter or not, one shouldn't break rules to the point of being banned. And it's precisely that you're a lover of LoL you would know the rules better than most people.

There was an update to intentional feeder detection on PBE when the dunkey thing happened and it has since been released.\n\nWhile trolls may set off people like dunkey, if people likely dunkey wouldn't take the bait then a lot of trolls wouldn't exist. Raging at trolls is giving them exactly what they want. Its like giving a puppy a treat every time it shits on the carpet.","replies":[]}]}]}
