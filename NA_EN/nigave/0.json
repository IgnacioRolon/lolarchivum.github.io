For example, her R you can&#039;t flash, dash, or get out any other way. Camille either has to leave the ult or get killed. Her e Is also a skill that is broken. She can use her e to go to a wall and then a champ or go over a wall. This is a great way to escape but when people face her it is really stupid.","replies":[{"poster":"RoflLizard","date":"2017-01-24T03:53:37.391+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"We, have a mobile champ who can tank.

Because of her passive, she is too tanky against every kind of champ.

Only counter I found are these, who can push camille of her ultimate, like tristana. Make her less tanky plz.

If she ever E you, you Riposte and she's stunned. Fiora's a great duelist who can match Cammille's damages and mobility. Early on you can't engage on her unless she screws up, but later on you outscale her.\n\nAnother champion who does great against her is poppy, as her W stops the dash, and you can E the Camille into a wall if she's too close, which puts a lot of pressure on Camille since she needs to be close to the wall to use her E.\n\nAlso, no offense but Garen is really bad, he's only good in low elos where people haven't learned yet how to deal with him.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Talon Talks","date":"2017-01-06T05:58:16.768+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"Everything in your post asks for a rework not a nerf. just saying.

His E makes it very easy to absorb the damage of her second Q.\n\nI don't play much Jax or Fiora, but I've never had any issue dueling Camille at just about any phase of the game as Master Yi or Tryndamere, both top tier duelists.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"The KDA is a lie","date":"2017-02-27T19:41:31.325+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"In my opinion, Camille should only get a nerf on her E, as is allows for too much safety. It is intended to be for engages, which is does fairly well (maybe even a bit too well ?) but it is also used to just get away quickly, which it shouldn't. \n\nAs for her damages, she is **intended** to be an assassin-like bruiser. So it's normal fer her to have good damages, what's a problem however is how she is able to apply these damages whenever she want with very little counterplay available. Her E is meant to have built-in counterplay on the form of a \"requires her to be next to a wall\" but in reality it's extremely easy to use, and you can use it most of the time. \n\nSo tl;dr : Her damages are alright, but her E needs some kind of change/nerf.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MissingKayo","date":"2016-12-24T17:15:02.737+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Because people are stupid and freak out about new champs instead of thinking straight and figuring out how to play against them.","replies":[{"poster":"El Leche Man","date":"2016-12-27T22:37:47.979+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"I mean in a 1v1 lvl 1 riven lost and we all know riven you never lvl 1, also her damage is insane while still being really tanky last game we 1v3d her and only one person made it out","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CupOfHotCoco","date":"2016-12-27T16:03:02.681+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"{{champion:164}}  She is mostly op because of her ult, her e, and her passive because she can just ult you when you are low and you have no means of escaping.
