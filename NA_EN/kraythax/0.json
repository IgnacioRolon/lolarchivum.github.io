I had some fun over the last few days and worked on my Ornn skills and got promoted to Bronze 4. A minor victory, yes, but it made me happy. I thought, well I am doing better! But .... After 2 games against obvious ELO Boosting players (one even admitted he was Diamond 2), one lousy game from horrific internet connection and a couple games where the bot lane fed the other team and, of course, blamed it on Jungle, I&#039;m back at Bronze 5. The game cant be played like a ladder because it doesn&#039;t matter what you do if your team blows up the game in the first 5 min and no amount of tank will stop the supercharged enemies. \r\n\r\nYou see the game is a team game, if one member of the team doesn&#039;t hold up their part, it goes to hell. That&#039;s fine when you are with a pre-made team or in LCS but matching with random players it just means you will be forever in frustration. \r\n\r\nYou cant get better at this game. You cant climb the ladder, nothing you do helps. Just .... well .... I&#039;ve got no desire to play anymore. The fact that Riot doesn&#039;t care about average run of the mill players dispirits me even more.  The fact that at least 50% of players are Gold or Diamond level in their Toxicity makes me even less desirous to play. \r\n\r\nI am sure I will be flamed below. There will be a legion of people fountain every league trope out there at me. I dont care. I&#039;m not gold, never claimed to be. I know I do things wrong. I know I have bad games. I just know there is no future, no ladder to climb. And that means no enjoyment. \r\n\r\nI&#039;m done. \r\n\r\nRiot, send me an email if you ever care enough to fix these and I will try out your product again. \r\n\r\nPlease see below for all the flames you want to see about me, my family and my ancestry back the last 10 generations.

Participation in kills, objectives taken. Riot tracks hundreds of stats per game and per player. There is an ample data set to devise an ELO algorithm that doesn't allow someone to obliterate your ranking with their bad play.

We rarely kill, rarely do a lot of damage. From what you say the only people that should be \"allowed\" to climb are ADCs. You don't see my damage mitigated, the crowd control score, the wards placed. You only care about kills. So that is your obsession. In fairness you pretty clearly illustrated why the game at bornze is fubar. KDA ... KDA ... KDA they shout while dropping only a single ward all game and not taking a single objective. Junglers often split push and take objectives, or they exert lane pressure to allow the laners to get CS. There is more to the game than your precious KDA. \n\nExhibit A why the ranking system is a mess. \n\n> \n> So what can you do?\n> \n> _Stop blaming the system or your teammates for it._\n\nDid you read my post? I gather you didnt. I never claimed I was silver, diamond or anything else so get off the lecture circuit. If I get up to 10 minutes, push lanes when laners go back, exert lane pressure and dont die once but bot lane feeds their ADC 6/0 what do you propose I am supposed to do to tank the untankable. \n\nOh sorry, per above all you care about is KDA and damage. \n\nExhibit B. \n\n> \n> Sometimes you&#x27;ll just have games where you play good but end up with uncarriable teammates, that happens to everyone.\n\nI don't carry and your obsession with carries is Exhibit C why people like you should not be giving advice. If I am counter ganking that jungler and he gets away but doesn't kill my ADCs then that is a victory. There is more to the game than KDA. At least that is what riot says all the time. Apparently you think different. I think you are spoiled at not having rampant feeders. \n\n> \n> But even then, what does it get you when you blame your teammates or the system for it?\n> **Nothing.**\n\nOh but you see I am supposed to do ... what exactly ... vs the smurf which had 6x APM than any bronze player and is fed 21/1 ? Oh I know ... carry but stop blaming the game. The game is designed to snowball. And it does. That means if any player snowballs the opponent your precious KDA is going to look dismal.\n\nSo lets say .. you are right. You can only climb if you ADC and if you carry every game. Well then that pretty much proves my OP. Riot doesn't give a damn about the regular player only the high ELO players. \n\n> You won&#x27;t improve as a player and will never get better, and that is exactly the problem.\n> \n> So if you actually want to get better, you&#x27;ll need to change your mentality.\n> You will only get better if you look at your own mistakes instead of the ones of your teammates.\n> In every situation that went wrong, you&#x27;ll need to ask yourself what you could have done better and play like that the next time such a situation happens.\n> Even if your teammates fuck up heavily, don&#x27;t focus on their mistakes, but on your own instead.\n\nAnd that was the theory, but it doesn't hold up. I improved my skills, my map awareness, my warding, my ganking and have done so extensively. I rarely ever make what i can classify as stupid mistakes like diving towers with little health or over chasing into unknown jungle. But again, if my team has fed one guy that can now 1v5 all of us then it is irrelevant. \n\n> \n> If you do that, i will guarantee you that you will see yourself improving and climbing.\n> \n> But yeah, now it&#x27;s up to you what you want to do.\n> That would just be my advice if you actually want to get better.\n\nNo. I wont. I did this extensively over last three months. I am infintely better than I was. And again I was knocked back to Bronze 5 by 2 enemy smurfs, one legit crappy game, and 3 games where my teammates fed like banshees and nothing i can do about it. \n\nOr am I supposed ot exert mind control over the other players? This notion you spout that ever loss is your fault is complete BS. I can improve my KDA easily, when my team is behind I will just sit on the pad to keep my KDA up and we will lose. You see there is no individual ELO system. \n\nI noticed you are platinum. Good for you. Having players that feed 0/5 in early game is probably rarely known to you because other players are better that you are with. Well those lower have no such luck. When that enemy adc is powered 5/0 and can rip through my 3.5k hp in literally 3 shots, there is NOTHING i can do.","replies":[{"poster":"Shadòw","date":"2017-09-03T01:04:21.224+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"even Tanks can carry, trust me.\n\nwell maybe {{champion:516}} is not the best champion atm (he still has upcoming buffs cause he sucks atm), but I have seen plenty of Tanks carry games by just making the right decisions in the right moments.\nEspecially Jungle is a very good role to carry cause you have a lot of influence on the early game which will be the core of the rest of the game.\nOften a good early game can already mean a win.\n\nthe 2 smurfs were unlucky, but it could have also happened that they landed in your team and gave you a free win.\n\nand i never said every loss is your fault, i specifically said that it happens that you'll get unwinnable games.\nthat happens to everyone.\n\nwhat i said is that even in those games only your own mistakes are important, even if your teammates were far worse than you.\n\nMe being plat and not knowing the feel of having someone feed 0/5 in the early game?\nThat joke was good.\nTrust me, that won't get better.\nIn every elo there are people getting outperformed.\nThat has various reasons.\nSometimes it's just bad luck, or maybe they are tilted, or maybe it actually is because they are worse than their elo and currently dropping.\nBut sometimes these players are on the enemy team, they aren't always on your team.\nEveryone who says something else is lying.\n\nYeah I can't carry my bad teammates and usually lose when I have such people too.\nI can only win games where I have good teammates atm.\nAnd that means I am in my deserved Elo.\nSo yeah, to get to Diamond I'll need to get better and carry those games in which i end up with not so good teammates.\nThat's the same way I've come to Plat in the first place.\nI didn't start there, nobody did.\n\nSo back to my point.\nNo you have no control over your teammates minds.\nThe thing is that you get 4 teammates and 5 enemies of the same MMR as you.\nThere is no reason why the bad teammates should always be in your team, and it isn't like that in reality.\nSometimes the bad players are on the enemy team.\nSo what matters is what impact _you_ have on the game.\nAre you able to outperform your enemies as teammates, do you play equally, or do you perform worse?\nThis are the things who determine if you will climb, stagnate or drop after a couple of games.\nWhat matters aren't single games, but what impact you have in multiple games.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"PinkSalt","date":"2017-09-03T00:07:59.156+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so, someone who goes 21/2 with a team that averages 3/6 should be placed with THOSE people,  since the elo is based on wins?

I have played Soraka many times, gotten an S and had 0 kills. Why? Because that is not her role to score kills. Her role is to support the team. Ornn, for example, is a crowd control champ, not a champ that scores kills. He builds tank and soaks up damage. I will have 67k self mitigated damage 2/6/14 record, for example and get 3 honors because team mates know I am the reason they won. Sometimes I will be chain stunned but that's ok because my ADCs are not and can wreck them while they foolishly pound on me. If you score everything based on KDA then you are a good example of the kind of player that wrecks games for people.","replies":[{"poster":"PinkSalt","date":"2017-09-03T00:16:34.711+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But someone who feeds can easily bring someones elo down, w/o a problem?

Hm.\n\nSomeone that feeds can. If the Bot lane feeds the enemy ADC 5 of 6 kills, that ADC becomes unstoppable and nothing you can do will stop them. Thy snowball and then when you haven't died at all up until then you get wrecked until the end of the game 1/7. So yes. A single person with a bad game can destroy your ELO and in Bronze there are lots of those. The ELO in this game isn't any measure of personal skill. Its just a measure of how lucky you are.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"BLS Wolfpack","date":"2017-09-02T23:41:26.480+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"exactly.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Kraythax","date":"2017-09-02T23:39:23.751+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lilmissbou,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=NPWAaBOq,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2017-09-02T23:10:31.192+0000)\n>\n> People aren&#x27;t even saved from the toxic scum in boards, ouch.\n\nLOL You deserve an up vote, Sir. :)","replies":[{"poster":"BLS Wolfpack","date":"2017-09-02T23:40:14.250+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"upvoted","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"BLS Wolfpack","date":"2017-09-02T23:25:13.930+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"It's a pretty good post.","replies":[{"poster":"Shadòw","date":"2017-09-02T23:27:08.037+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"no it isn't.\nall i see is whining.\n\na good post contains suggestions.","replies":[{"poster":"BLS Wolfpack","date":"2017-09-02T23:27:58.625+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"This post is suggesting that Riot changes their game?","replies":[{"poster":"Shadòw","date":"2017-09-02T23:28:59.081+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"\"I can't climb out of Bronze so change the game and email me ty\"\n\nepic suggestion","replies":[{"poster":"BLS Wolfpack","date":"2017-09-02T23:29:56.051+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not a very nice one.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"SwiftKitten88","date":"2017-09-02T23:26:56.792+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i climbed out of bronze 3 times..
