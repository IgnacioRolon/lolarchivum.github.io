I have no rewards in loot after playing a game either. It seems I was not given any blue essence for my runs nor was I given any skins for rune page buys.","replies":[{"poster":"AllShallEndSoon","date":"2017-11-11T18:05:01.820+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I did get those missions.

I got the popup saying I was gonna be rewarded 33k BE while I was in a queue with my husband. Got into a game at about the same time I hit okay; Almost knew right off the bat that it was gonna bug out. Played the game, ended up winning it, then came out of the post-game screen to see the exact same amount I had the day before (was like 1520,) and only received the quest bonus. This new system stinks to high heaven. Time to find another game to invest in.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-09T05:38:21.778+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I know a lot of this has been a bit confusing, but it looks like only tier 3 runes were being refunded and runes purchased after the price drop (Sept 1st) are *not* being refunded since cost so little.","replies":[]}]}
