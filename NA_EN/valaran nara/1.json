Thank you for diving head first into a pit full of vipers and flesh eating scarabs to clear up the tumult that has arisen since the start of &quot;The Great Retcon.&quot;  Despite the personal incidents you had to go through, you&#039;re still following up on your promise to speak more to us and to provide context on the world of Runeterra.\r\n\r\nI know, despite your best efforts, some people will still be critical, rejecting most of what you say and countering with &quot;...but the old lore!&quot;  Regardless, you gave us insight in what the future may come for the lore, or, at the very least, you gave us your plans on how to bring everything together.  While I would have LOVED if TF was the gambler in The River King&#039;s teaser, I&#039;m even more glad that it was a random person in the world of Valoran.  That means, more people who can actually support a story as opposed to every champion having to become a minor character to bring all other stories together.  Not only that, but it also means TF still may have a chance encounter with RK.  Two different gamblers, but two VERY different outcomes.\r\n\r\nSo, all in all, I just wanted to let you know there is at least 1 person out there who appreciates your efforts.
