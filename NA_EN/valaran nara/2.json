As someone who really enjoyed his kinda reverse Yasuo lore (Rather than running to save the village, follow duty and protect the elder) it was a massively dramatic change that overall changed his character. However, I do understand why Riot decided on this, as his previous lore fit very mediocre with being a Darkin, where his new lore fits very strongly. Yes, the old lore is gone and Varus is essentially changed forever do to it, but League is an ever evolving game, and Riot is bound to mess up when they take risks.\n\nOther than the Varus change, do you have any other (preferably that don't accompany a VGU) to share?

Varus has an iconic gameplay kit that is fun and accessible to players of all skill levels, healthy for the game in terms of play/counterplay, and carves out its own niche in terms of strengths and weaknesses among the cast of adcs. A dramatic change to his kit to risk destroying this delicate balance in order to better match a lore update would be a grand sin.

For example, Varus is one of the adcs who received little to no work in the Marksman update because the team working on the update recognized his kit as already being healthy and iconic.\n\nThe fact that you've enjoyed the stories as standalone stories really doesn't have anything to do with what I'm talking about. The story meshes poorly with the gameplay, the story is disloyal to people who were already fans of the character, the actual quality of it is irrelevant. The Varus rework was a failure.\n\nAatrox is getting a VGU because his gameplay is garbage and has been since he went live. It didn't feel unique or fun, it didn't mesh with his lore, and it wasn't healthy for the game.
