The champion is playing you.\r\n\r\nFor context, here is what happened:\r\n\r\nPlayer:\r\n&quot;I was wondering if your team had considered removing Akali&#039;s stealth from towers so that she would be able to get compensation buffs somewhere instead of constantly being nerfed.\r\nA lot of Akali players seem to at least be interested in discussing something like that. Would be cool if you guys had any thoughts on her shroud.\r\nEdit: She would still retain her obscurity from champions while under turret, but turrets would be able to target and damage her while obscured for example.&quot;\r\n\r\nRiot Meddler: \r\n&quot;That&#039;s an ongoing discussion internally right now covering whether this is the sort of unique strength we should be preserving despite its costs or something we should remove because of its downsides, thereby as you say freeing us up to put some power elsewhere. Will update once we&#039;ve got a conclusion.&quot;\r\n\r\nPlayer:\r\n&quot;Is this something you could possibly explore with Yasuo as well (considering he&#039;s the bane of low elo regardless if he&#039;s strong or not)? Sorry to be piggybacking on something about Akali, but both champs share the same situation.&quot;\r\n\r\nRiot Meddler:\r\n&quot;We&#039;ve had that discussion regarding Yasuo and believe his unique strengths (I&#039;m guessing you&#039;re thinking Windwall and/or the E CD?) are worth preserving.&quot;\r\n\r\n\r\nI understand that you want to make Champions unique to play as. Pyke has an execute ulti that gives gold to the last assisting champion. Lulu has polymorph and her ult that makes people huge. Draven is Draaaaaaaaaaaaaaaven.\r\n\r\nBut. When you give a champion a mechanic that is unique to that champion alone, things can go south really badly if it&#039;s done poorly. The biggest example here being Yasuo. \r\nNow, I&#039;m not going to go into depth about why Yasuo is a complete failure in champion design. (I can write a 10 page essay on that) I want to go into detail about why it&#039;s a bad idea to give champions mechanics that are unique to them. \r\n\r\nBack then, in old League, programming for the game was a bit different. The champions had much simpler abilities. Usually they just did damage and had a little upside. For example: Annie&#039;s Q did damage, and refunded mana on kill. Pantheon&#039;s Q just did damage. Singed&#039;s Q led a poison trail. Teemo&#039;s Q dealt damage and applied a blind.\r\nThey were simple. Easy to balance. Easy to maintain. Easy to understand.\r\n\r\nThen things started to pick up. \r\nFizz&#039;s Q was a dash that applied on hit effects. Varus&#039; Q gave him a lot of range and poke. Lulu&#039;s Q was fired from both her and Pix, it also slowed. Riven&#039;s Q was cast 3 times. Each cast did damage, dashed a little, and the last dash was a knockup too. \r\n\r\nAt this point, this didn&#039;t get too crazy. They were more complex yes, but not by a large margin.\r\n\r\n\r\nThen came Yasuo. (I&#039;m using him as an example again, because, well, he&#039;s a **really good example**)\r\nYasuo&#039;s Q was treated as a basic attack, it&#039;s CD scaled with attack speed, it could crit, it could also knock up on 3rd cast with long range, and it also applies on hit effects. \r\n\r\nI know I&#039;m only mentioning Q abilities, but you can compare the overall kits as well.\r\n\r\nAnnie had the following:\r\nA passive that counted up to 5 abilities, the 5th stunning the target.\r\nA Q that refunded it&#039;s mana cost on kill\r\nA W that increased her armor/MR, and had a pseudo thornmail\r\nAn E that was literally an AoE damage\r\nAnd a summon that had sunfire and would help her fight. It also was an AoE stun if timed.\r\n\r\nPantheon has the following:\r\nA passive that blocks a single basic attack or turret shot after he attacks a certain number of times\r\nA Q that just does damage\r\nA W that deals damage over time, and allows him to crit low HP targets\r\nAn E that stuns and deals low damage\r\nAnd an R that makes him teleport to a location a ways away\r\n\r\nSinged has the following:\r\nA passive that converts mana to HP\r\nA Q that makes a poison train\r\nA W that makes an AoE slow (Or root if used correctly)\r\nAn E that flung people behind him\r\nAnd an R, which was a flat stat booster\r\n\r\nTeemo has the following:\r\nA passive that let&#039;s him turn invisible if he&#039;s still\r\nA Q that damages and blinds\r\nA W that gives him a small speed boost\r\nAn E that makes his auto attacks a bit more damage\r\nAnd an R that creates a trap that deals a decent amount of damage over time\r\n\r\nNow let&#039;s see a some more advanced examples\r\n\r\nFizz had* the following: (I&#039;m using his old kit)\r\nA passive that let him walk through minions and take reduced damage from them\r\nA Q that was a dash, on hit effects, and also did damage\r\nA W that empowered his basic attacks\r\nAn E that made him untargetable, and could go either a short distance, or a long distance\r\nAnd an R that slowed the target, knocked it up after a delay, damaged it, and could stick to champions if cast right.\r\n\r\nRiven has the following\r\nA passive that increases her damage on her auto attacks when casting abilities\r\nA Q that can be cast 3 times, each being a dash, dealing damage, and the last being a knock up \r\nA W that was an AoE stun\r\nAn E that was a dash and gave her a shield\r\nAnd and R that increased her AD, and could function as an execute as well.\r\n\r\nNow let&#039;s take that to a champion like Yasuo and Irelia\r\n\r\nYasuo has:\r\nA passive that gives him double crit, and a shield whenever he takes a substantial amount of damage\r\nA Q that behaves like an auto attack, applies on hit effects, can crit, CD scales with attack speed, and can knock people up on the 3rd cast, with additional range\r\nA W that can block projectiles and makes his shield refresh faster\r\nAn E that can be cast in rapid succession, with the each enemy you hit with it being an illegal target for a longer amount of time\r\nAnd an R that teleported him to a knocked up champion, increasing the knock up by a second, and gave him 50% armor penetration\r\n\r\nIrelia has:\r\nA passive that increases her damage as she fights, increases her attack speed, and does bonus damage to shields\r\nA Q that heals her, applies on hit effects, and refreshes on kill or mark hit\r\nA W that reduces damage, gives her a passive stack, and cannot be interrupted\r\nAn E that creates a blade, and can be cast a second time to create another blade, which makes a line that deals damage and stuns everyone between them\r\nAnd an R that creates a pseudo arena that marks any enemy champion in it so she can dash to them again, deals damage, and if you cross the arena wall you can&#039;t auto attack and are slowed.\r\n\r\nNotice how overloaded these kits are. There&#039;s so many things going on that balancing these champions would a god awful nightmare. (Just look at Jhin!)\r\n\r\nRiot, you need to stop one upping each champion in the mechanics department. Just give each champion a unique feel to them. Anivia can be reborn. Annie has an AoE stun with Tibbers, Pantheon can jump around the map and hit people. Enough with these convoluted kits, and even more convoluted &quot;exceptions&quot; for some champions. Yasuo can block projectiles, and becomes invulnerable if he&#039;s standing in the wall. Akali has invisibility to TOWERS.\r\n\r\nYou play champions because you like their play style. Not because they have a &quot;unique strength&quot;\r\n\r\nUnique strengths should come from the player, not the champion.","replies":[{"poster":"IP Masquerena","date":"2018-11-30T13:21:57.615+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":24,"body":"I'm sorry, but I'd rather have more complex champion than simple ones.\n\nLook at Garen or IAmASonicWannaBeThatWillKillYouWithNoCounterPlayIfIGetCloseToYou aka Udyr.\n\nGaren Q's hits you, spins, W's out and ban, he won the trade, you got no counterplay to that, and also, if you do get more damage on him than he did on you but you don't kill him, he just lets you push while his passive heals him and you're like \"wait, what? I won that trade, you're not allowed to change the winner by just afking in xp range\"\n\nThen there's Udyr. No skillshots for you to dodge, movespeed that unless you're Talon with 3 available walls, he still gets you and if you can't burst him down before he reaches you, you're dead. You can't outrun him when chasing or running away, you can't duel him unless he's 0-10 and you're 100-0 and all he does is auto you with stuns.\n\nThere are many more simple champs that you have nothing you can do against them (Yi, Tryndamere, Jax) and you can't properly nerf them. Why? All they do is damage, you take that away, they're useless, there is no inbetween. You can't say that \"just increase the cooldown on Yi's Q/Trynd's W and they will be balanced, as if they can't reach you as easily, they can't kill you\" then you realize that they don't need to cast that more than once. You can remove all the resets on their mobility, all they need to do is cast it once for them to kill you, as once they reach you, you're dead. No matter how much utility you remove from them, it doesn't matter, as that utility is trash as it is, all they need is to reach you once and you're dead, so the only nerf you can give them is take away damage, but since that's all they do is damage, then if you take damage away from them, what will they do?\n\nOn the other hand, for more complex champions you have room to take away from their power budget to and still allow them to do stuff. Look at Yasuo, you can take away from him W or from his Q via cooldowns, hitboxes, etc, you can reduce from the power of his ult, you have room to take away from his power or utility.\n\nThat's why more complex champions are better than simpler ones, because for complex ones, you have more many avenues from which you can take power away, compared to the easy ones where you either take away from the single thing they do, or you do nothing.","replies":[{"poster":"HÔPÊ","date":"2018-11-30T16:58:58.129+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":5,"body":"Garen is simple, but there is a counterplay and he has low outplay potential.

His Q isn't a good ability to chase, because you can basically just walk away. His w is strong. His e is doing good dmg, but many garen players go too agressive with it and lose trades. His R is point and click = too strong. Basically, if you can sustain through early game, you can pick up an executioner blade or something else and he cannot do shit about that. He cannot do anything against poke champions as well. He has counterplay, but his playstyle is garbage and he is overbuffed.

You can count Viktor there as well, but meh. \n\nBad match-up for Garen =/= counter play. That's like saying Draven - Leo lane is counter play for Vayne - Soraka\n\nYou can out run his Q? If you're 2 miles away, sure, otherwise, especially with the new Celerity, you can't.\n\nGaren has a movespeed of 340 base, 365 with Brown Boots. his Q adds 30%, another 109.5, but since Celerity makes it be a 32.5% boost, that will be 118.6 for a grand total of 483.6 for 3.5 sec. Ok, go out ran that with something that's not Udyr.

The passive activates AFTER 9-4 seconds (based on level) from the last time you got damage on him. Ignite lasts 5, then the passive starts, so all you do unless the Ignite kills him is slow his passive down by 5 sec, assuming the last thing you throw as damage on him is Ignite, otherwise, by even less. GW effects last either 3 sec if coming from Executioner's Calling or Morellonomicon and 1 sec if coming from Bramble Vest/Thorn Mail, which is, 1-6 seconds (depending when you get the GW and from what it comes) too short.

Now it is rarely a case, because of how ridiculous his W is and how overbuffed he is. And of course GW was helping in the past. If you had a champion that could poke him that is. \n\nNow it doesn't work that way, but it doesn't matter that those days won't come back (they won't). \n\nI am not protecting Garen.

If you weaken the passive, he still doesn't care as he cares to oneshot you. No matter what you take power from, he doesn't care, because his main aspect now is the damage, so if you want to nerf him the right way and not with placebo nerfs is to take away from his damage, but if you do that, he'll be trash. He can tank....ok, others can do it better, and all his utility is a meh cd single target melee range silence.\n\nThat's the problem with simple champs, you can only nerf the one thing they do, but if you do that, they are trash.\n\nIn Irelia's case, you have room to take away from her power, shifting and changing until you get to a good result. You can lower the the duration of the marks, reduce E throw range, increase costs, decrease that, you have room to change her while also keeping her playable, but you can't do the same with Garen or other simple champs.\n\nThat's why more complex champs are actually healthier for the game than simpler ones. Yes, there is a level of simplicity that should be kept in the game and I believe TF is one of the best \"simple kit\" champs in the game.\n\nCan there be simple champs in the game? Yes\nShould there be simple champs in the game? Yes, they are needed for the game\nHow simple should they be?

No one wants to be frustrated this badly playing against a champion\nZoe - Free Summoners hurt, empowered auto's, Hard CC that can be a trap or direct skill shot while also being able to go through any length of wall, 1 shot capability, and more\nYasuo - not only does he have his abilities, but he has stupid additional mechanics such as taking him out of tower aggro range when ulting (WHY), full shield when ulting (WHY). and so on\nIrelia - There is no need for her to be bouncing around lane as much as she does, they need to nerf her ability to run hop from minion to minion and people would feel so much better about her.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SSW Talon","date":"2018-12-01T00:56:57.393+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Irelia isn't remotely simple to play, but you're right in that her counterplay is pretty low.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Dynikus","date":"2018-11-30T07:06:54.311+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":27,"body":"Your \"tl;dr\" is incredibly disingenuous, and this whole post just comes off as another of the hundreds/thousands of threads of people that just hate Yasuo. \n\nFor an actual tl;dr:\nA player asked about a reasonable nerf to Akali's W.

The Developer's work ethic has yet to change and they know this. Instead of actually working on mistakes they made, champions that really need it, and older champions . . . .the Developers take abilities from older champions, don't rework older champions, don't rework problem champions, and actually make new champions with older champion themes and abilities. No matter how you look at this, it all boils down to Developers not giving two craps about their mistakes and older champions. Ryze was prioritized for 7/8 reworks and VGU, Ezreal was prioritized for a mini-VGU, Ahria and Lux received 4 to 5 months worth of work to rework their kits. No other champion that these Developers have ruined has received the type of work ethic these Developers give new champions and popular ones.\n\nThere is 75% of the champion pool that is outdated with art, their kits, themes, and identities. It's kind of annoying when you see a walking tree with a Shield Bomb that belonged on another champion, but was removed for no reason on the original champion and the replacement is something that already exists in the game as an item active. It's really annoying to see a certain new champion have the identity of another champion that isa trickster, but the original champion with that identity is ignored.\n\nLet's just all come to the conclusion that instead of actually improving and working on updating all things in this game, Developers are more worried about adding new champions and new mechanics that break the game. Look at all the change they tried to do this year and it back fired on them . . . when all these Developers had to do was listen to the community and actually give us a stable game. Look at how many players are upset that their champions are constantly being ignored for substantial work, but Developers are talking about a new champion or a popular one that is being prioritized for everything. The Developers care too much about keeping the game fresh and adding new content instead of revitalizing things that are already beloved about the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Meritas","date":"2018-12-02T03:56:45.384+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think that ideally all champions would allow for a high _micro_ play/outplay cap.
