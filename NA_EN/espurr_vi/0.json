Specifically, the [Xbox Game Bar](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html) was auto-enabled and causing fps and freezing issues.  Try disabling that for a fix!  If you continue to have issues, check out our [FPS issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting) guide in case of other issues like bad game files.

It would be nice if they could I don't know put out a server update, letting us know they're aware of the problem and trying to fix it, but according to them, a bunch of computer's just magically got slower around the same time that patch 6.20 came out. I'm supposed to be running at 350 fps, I'm getting 60 along with 60 ping opposed to 31. \"Oh maybe its your internet\" No, stfu cause I still run Counterstrike at 31 ping.","replies":[]}]}
