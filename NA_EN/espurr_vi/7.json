She was supposed to be a battlemage. Riot turned her into what you described.  The moron in charge of her rework stripped almost everything the champion and now Riot Games is saying they didn't have the technology to do what they wanted to do. No, you just made an imbecile who didn't care about her Karma in charge of a rework that didn't need that much changing. Great job Riot Games. It's ok. The community is used to your incompetence at this point.","replies":[{"poster":"IxtaliKing","date":"2016-11-01T02:00:39.070+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tbh the rework itself was salvageable, the major fk ups came with 5.10 and 6.6 when they doubled down on making her a generalist support instead of the battle mage she should have been.

Just like Morde and Shen, I feel like her treatment since her \"relaunch\" has been terrible. They removed everything for a theme that doesn't make sense for her and a visual update that cannot be bothered to be finished. I am tired of their excuses and tired of their laziness. At this point it is too late to do anything drastic to her kit because, their laziness, it is too long. New Karma players are accustomed to her new kit. The least these Red Name Donald Trump ingrates can do is finish her visual update.","replies":[{"poster":"IxtaliKing","date":"2016-11-01T02:59:51.388+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"All Karma needs is a change of direction as far her gameplay is concerned. Riot have taken her in the direction of a generic Enchanter, and as we've seen she has nothing interesting or unique to add in that space. Everything Karma does, other supports do, and she's only good when the other supports aren't. As a battle mage Karma has a lot more to offer, with her Enchanter elements making her distinct from the other battle mages.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"SilverSquid","date":"2016-11-01T17:11:11.549+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"She feels lackluster as a utility mage, because **she wasn't supposed to be one**.\nShe used to bring utility&damage in every spell, making her a utility battle mage.\nWhen they forgot about that idea and removed half the damage in her kit, she was left with lackluster utility, that has become increasingly bland with all the better and more interesting utility mages introduced since. \n\nShe undeniably offers _some_ utility and _some_ damage, but it doesn't feel coherent anymore, as those things are **exclusive** in her kit. Like, it's either her OP shield/MS-boost OR her damage. A utility mage shouldn't deal damage, so it's essentially a utility mage with a dead ability. A utility mage shouldn't heal herself, so her RW is arguably a dead ability most of the time too. Especially since it fades compared to the power of RE.\n\nSo her utility is:\n\n* Weak, avoidable and short slow\n* Brief, risky  and unreliable root\n* Overbuffed AoE shield and MS-Boost. \n\nCompare this to the skillset of any other utility mage and she really doesn't look like one anymore. She is as _\"utility-y\"_ as a Syndra with Locket/Talisman combo.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MisterShameless","date":"2016-11-01T06:09:22.960+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your last match, you lost to a Karma mid who went 7-3-11.
