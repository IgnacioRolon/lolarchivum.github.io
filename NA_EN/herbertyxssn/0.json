But jungler and ADC players do this in like 70% of my games.\r\n\r\nNot counting for the role but if there's someone who resembles a bot programmed to give away kills without fear of consequence in the mid-late game, it's either the ADC or jungler. They don't care. Playing in silver feels like I'm playing with pre-programmed bots these days except these two roles have always been the most extreme case of ignorant players who won't listen to your pings and continue to make poor decisions.","replies":[{"poster":"Modnar Erom","date":"2019-11-26T21:11:02.655+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I doubt they really do.  Why they likely appear to is the xp disparity.   For junglers, you can only be ganking 1 of 3 possible lanes on the map at any given time.  In season 9 if they didn't want to fall too far behind xp wise they basically had to perma-gank.  Now, a little more xp is there but it is so spread out that you really have to hard farm and even then you will fall behind solo lanes.\n\nADC is basically a squeek toy living in constant fear of getting blown up by the assassin midlaner with a 2+ level advantage.   They can try to get solo xp away from their support, but that just makes them even more of a juicy target.  And the support is in the same boat, just without the gold income.   So a great deal of what is considered \"bad macro\" is likely just the ADC and jungler trying to find ways to get enough xp and gold to stay relevant to the game.   Also, when you have a level and gold advantage like mid and top do, you can run around the map and \"bad macro\" can turn into catching someone out since if you run into the enemy jg, adc, or support you win the 1v1 100% or at least blow summoners and their ult as they run for their lives.\n\nAnd one might think, well group and get XP through kills, but this really doesn't work.  I was spectating a buddy's game the other day and he was playing mid.  The tristana bot was something like 11/0/4, while he was ~ 2/1/4, and their top GP was ~ 1/0/3.  The tristana was a level down to my friend mid, and 2 levels behind the GP, and never really closed the gap.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KVbqbFsC8e","date":"2019-11-26T21:29:23.579+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=HerbertyXsSn,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=kR0cmxHn,comment-id=,timestamp=2019-11-26T20:43:15.960+0000)\n\n> Not counting for the role but if there's someone who resembles a bot programmed to give away kills \n\nHow are you going to say this when you are playing on a botted account?","replies":[]},{"poster":"ˉˆˉˆˉ","date":"2019-11-26T20:50:35.799+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because you're playing in low silver and everyone makes those same mistakes in every game in that elo.","replies":[{"poster":"HerbertyXsSn","date":"2019-11-26T20:52:53.546+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Top and mid literally don't make those mistakes as often ans jungle or bot.

Even high level streamers seem to be done with this game at this point and I will be too as soon as my gaming PC parts arrive. Then I'll be probably play Doom 2016 for a week and hopefully find something else to binge on.","replies":[]}]}]}
