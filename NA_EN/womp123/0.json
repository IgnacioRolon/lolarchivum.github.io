Is this due to the shorter cd on Elise and Nidalee, or is this because Gnar is a newer champion and they hadn&#039;t thought of it? Or perhaps another reason? Should they change this?","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2016-02-19T19:47:40.700+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"Gnar's locked into his forms for significantly longer periods of time, so we felt communicating the difference on the minimap was appropriate. With Jayce, Nidalee, Elise and Quinn by contrast there's so little commitment to a form that we concluded the cost of the minimap spam created (something constantly changing, need to recognize additional icons) outweighed the extremely small benefits.","replies":[{"poster":"Sahn Uzal","date":"2016-02-19T20:37:23.704+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Me when I read the question:\nYeah, http://www.reactiongifs.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/doesnt_make_any_sense_anchorman.gif\nMe when I read your responses\nhttp://s2.quickmeme.com/img/ee/ee3180f46254a68ea246d553f9a783b60087f190c738222f4e61870da2d337d8.jpg\n\nSeriously though, you seem to have an explanation for everything, and it always seems to make sense >_>\n{{summoner:31}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Photos of Ghosts","date":"2016-02-19T20:46:07.952+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The benefits it had was that I didn't cancel my homeguards ult as Quinn after noticing I'm still Quinn on the minimap >:\\","replies":[]},{"poster":"Womp123","date":"2016-02-19T20:04:57.346+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the response, I understand now :]","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Abyssphere","date":"2016-02-19T19:51:25.827+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think it's not even just that they change more often but also because it's not really very important to know what form Nid and Elise are in becuase it doesn't really make much difference regarding fighting them. It's worth trying to catch out a mini Gnar but not a mega Gnar, so it's good to know which form he's in. If you catch out a Nidalee/Elise you're not gonna decide if you can engage on them based on what form they're in.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-02-19T19:14:01.819+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That would be kind of awkward since they change so much. It would just be an annoying visual change on screen that gives no information. Showing that Gnar went Mega is actually useful.","replies":[]}]}
