They replaced her autas with stronger durations.\n\nSona still is an early to mid game threat. She still is a pain in bot lane with her 0 skill q aa proc to deal quite a bit of damage for free. That is her design, and she fulfils it with deaignated weaknesses.","replies":[{"poster":"Emmy Cha0s","date":"2015-10-01T14:10:12.555+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"> so they weren't oppressive.\n\nExcept there's a MAJOR flaw in your statement.

She has so much early game harass and protection that it is hard not to see why she is there. \nHer ult is by far one of the best initiations on par with a flash {{champion:1}} R when done correctly. \n\nIf she was so horribly gimped, why is she sitting at the 12th most popular champion on lolking charts, with a winrate above 50% consistently, and a ban/pick of ~10%.\n\nShe does not need buffs, she is fine how she is. She is A SUPPORT, she shouldn't be able to carry games, she has a role of buffs and brief auras, not to 100-0 people in an instant.","replies":[{"poster":"Pika310","date":"2015-10-01T15:32:10.164+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"> she has a role of buffs and brief auras,\n\nBy definition, an aura is permanent.

DOESN't matter what rank, what division, it is an average, that is higher that 90+ champions, it even states she is 24th in win-rates of the champions ON AN AVERAGE SCALE.\n\nIf you understood math classes, and realize that mean and average % are actually one of the best ways to weigh data, the more data, the closer they actually are in how they truly are in game. So all that bull about winrate not being useful is freaking hogwash, anything above 50 is amazing, anything below 43ish is lacking. She did hit one point on SEPT. 15, 2015, which was a few weeks ago, but LOOK, its right back up. \n\nand if you would realize that lane sona was a thing, the reason her AA damage is shit is because of her q +{{item:3100}} took way too much out of people for FREE. \nso don't go calling out low damages without ACTUALLY DISSECTING HOW SHE PLAYS\n \nhttps://themidnightalliance.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/sit-in-the-corner.gif","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
