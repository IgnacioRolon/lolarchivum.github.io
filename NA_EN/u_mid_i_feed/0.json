Hexakill, especially, shows no efforts were put in whatsoever. \n\nPlease design a mode / map where players can actually have FUN. People want a 10v1 warcraft style boss co-op, people want a Hide and Seek mode, there are tons of ideas out there yet Riot has failed to acknowledge and manifest them into reality. This is rather disappointing and discouraging.","replies":[{"poster":"SeCKS Egai","date":"2014-12-24T22:32:59.052+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Considering the state of dominion, I'm not surprised we aren't seeing major investments into fresh modes.","replies":[{"poster":"FFirebrandd","date":"2014-12-24T23:09:20.034+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"And TT, though that may be a little better off than dominion.","replies":[{"poster":"Sachabot","date":"2014-12-25T01:58:56.261+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"TT at least has a decent-sized playerbase for it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BLU Medic","date":"2014-12-27T10:28:46.827+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be fair, neglect of the gamemode, as well as allowing bots to run rampant on Dominion for months, really didn't help the game mode develop a pre-30 playerbase, which is important.","replies":[{"poster":"SeCKS Egai","date":"2014-12-29T06:41:25.393+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=BLU Medic,realm=NA,application-id=LFfTlAky,discussion-id=GrnyUl4A,comment-id=00010002,timestamp=2014-12-27T10:28:46.827+0000)\n>\n> To be fair, neglect of the gamemode, as well as allowing bots to run rampant on Dominion for months, really didn't help the game mode develop a pre-30 playerbase, which is important.\n\nIt depends on how you define neglect - I saw updates quite a bit when I was actively playing dom.  However, it didn't take long for the botting to take over, so I would consider that neglect for sure.\n\nFrom what I've experienced of the new player experience pre-30, it's been horrid in general with all the modes plagued by afk autoleveling bots.","replies":[{"poster":"BLU Medic","date":"2014-12-29T19:07:45.601+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not the same sort of thing that SR/TT/HA all get.
