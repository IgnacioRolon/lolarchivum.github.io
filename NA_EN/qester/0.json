Once I had my account back and logged in, It had my in a game which I could not connect to. Whoever took my account had started a ranked game, rewatched the replay afterwords. It looks like the person tried (?) until the end when they sold all their items and went afk in base. I don&#039;t know if the person flamed or was toxic or anything. \r\n\r\nOnce the game was done I got the honor screen, apologized to everyone in the chat and tried to explain what happened. Of course it sounds far fetched that someone else was playing on the account, and was told I was being reported regardless. I apologized again.\r\n\r\nMy question is, how are reports like this handled? Recently grinded a lot to finally get to Gold for end of season rewards and now I&#039;m concerned I will get a punishment / lose out of end of season rewards. (Random tidbits, Honor 4, have had the account for many many years without any punishments).\r\n\r\nThanks for your insight","replies":[{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2017-10-19T03:04:13.374+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"depends on what was done.\n\nFirstly, if you didn't get punished instantly after that game, you are safe from immediate punishments.\n\nSo to the second point, it depends on what the person did. Keep in mind that the system has the ability to filter out false reports.\n\nIf they were toxic, then it would leave a mark on your account. That mark can be \"diluted\" with many neutral/positive games played. On the flip side, if you are toxic in your games, it would \"increase the concentration\" and lead you closer towards punishment.\n\nIf they weren't toxic, then the system throws out the report.","replies":[{"poster":"Qester","date":"2017-10-19T03:48:10.273+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well its been about 2.5 hours since the game with no punishment so I guess I am safe? (Like I said, never been punished before and not sure how it works).\n\nAll I know is that through the replay it looked like he tried, top cs / damage on the team, however as his team was losing he sold all his items and went afk in base, beyond that I don't know what if anything he said in chat. \n\nSo essentially I am \"safe\" for now, and just make sure to keep playing like I have for years and whatever he did will eventually go away?","replies":[{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2017-10-19T14:27:08.333+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Technically speaking, it never leaves your account.\n\nThink of it as a drip of red paint in a bottomless tank, you can keep adding white paint and diluting the red, eventually the red won't be visible to the eye, but still exists in that tank.\n\nBut would that drip affect the account? doubt it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chermorg","date":"2017-10-19T11:41:20.995+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"AFKs like that are punished by LeaverBuster which doesn't punish based on only one game.
