Normally I get between 40-50ms, but every few games I get a 300+ solid ping for the entire game. Nothing is changing on my side, and when I have a game with 300+ latency, pinging the league servers gives me 40ms, and speedtest.net to LA from Seattle gives me the same and shows 40mbps.\r\n\r\nHas anyone else had this happen? Sometimes I can play 20 games without seeing the issue, but the game is virtually unplayable with 300-400ms and is constantly losing me games.","replies":[{"poster":"Son Golin","date":"2016-02-28T11:52:52.260+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Lockers,\n\nIf you're noticing extremely high latency when the Server Status Page says everything is fine, there might be something else going on that we want to investigate. The next time you run into a match where the latency is abnormally high (300+ ms latency when you normally get 40-50 ms), can you produce a tracert? Details on how to do this can be found here:\n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752674-Network-System-and-League-of-Legends-Logs#wq2\n\nAlso, please produce another tracert when you're experiencing normal 40-50ms ping. This will allow us to make a comparison regarding your internet route when you're having issues and not having issues.\n\nPlease contact my colleagues through the Support Site with both tracerts, Network Analysis (when you're having issues), and Network Info log (both the latter logs can be obtained in the page I linked you to previously):\n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/requests/new","replies":[]},{"poster":"zarakisempai","date":"2016-02-28T05:14:52.036+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes. Since a month ago. I always get a 90 ms, which is fine for me; but nowadays, I get an infernal lag, which is virtually unplayable as you said.\nI don't know what the cause may be, but I can tell you the s: I'm seriously thinking to quit league.","replies":[]}]}
