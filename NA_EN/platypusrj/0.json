Things that make them kind of obvious to spot:\r\n\r\n1) Below level 30...and no keystone mastery.\r\n2) Random summoner spells that don't match their roles (smite on Janna).\r\n3) Always play free champions.\r\n4) Obvious inability to evade attacks.\r\n5) Obvious indifference to getting hit by and then killed by turrets.\r\n6) Only move forward with a minion lane.\r\n7) They never chat in any form.\r\n\r\nThey also tend to disconnect randomly, though lately it's pre-minion spawning.  They also now sometimes randomly go down other lanes.\r\n\r\nI've noticed if there's two in a game then one stays at base for a while before also moving down mid with a future minion wave.\r\n\r\nThe biggest thing I've noticed recently (i.e. today) is that when you get into champion select, in the chat window where it shows people joining, the bots never show up there!  So in my last game, only 3 of us were shown joining the lobby, even though there were 5 of us and the  2 that didn't show up were bots.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how you can play without ever joining the lobby, but this seems like a potential giveaway that they're bots.\r\n\r\nAnyone else got anything?","replies":[{"poster":"Eetheart","date":"2017-07-17T17:43:29.096+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You pretty much covered it all.\n\nI would suggest a captcha for the first 10 games or so that a new player is about to join. And maybe more captchas if you get reported for being a bot -- which by the way, there should be a category in the report menu for bots/scripters.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-17T03:33:02.941+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"We're always working to help rid the community of botted accounts, and the best way you can help is by reporting those you suspect of botting.
