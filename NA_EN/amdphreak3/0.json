Some idiot thought he could go Udyr Jungle with no smite and grab Teleport, and the second I pointed out how stupid it is to go teleport on that map, the other idiot (duo queued) grabbed teleport just to be a bitch. I had to dodge this, because I'm not going to knowingly enter a game with two clearly idiotic people, who I KNOW are just going to gang up on me, troll me the whole game, and report me afterward. I should not be punished for dodging their complete idiocy. Prove me wrong!\n\nSee this is why League of Legends sucks. RIOT punishes the wrong people for the wrong shit and rewards the jackasses for being assholes.","replies":[{"poster":"zPOOPz","date":"2019-08-24T06:13:46.997+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"I guess they are the lucky ones who didn't have to play with you lol","replies":[]},{"poster":"GatekeeperTDS","date":"2019-08-24T05:35:58.985+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"> and the second I pointed out how stupid it is to go teleport on that map\n\nDude, you didn't get punished. You got a low priority queue as a deterrent for dodging. Keep up with the toxic chat though, and you'll get punished for real. You are not in charge. Nobody is required to listen to you tell them how to play, what to pick, what to do. Keep your mouth shut and worry about yourself.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-08-24T06:50:17.816+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The trick is to convince someone else to dodge.\n\nAs you saw.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Candoodle","date":"2019-08-24T07:57:04.174+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"have you considered maybe the second guy took tp to try and get you to dodge for being a toxic POS in champ lobby?","replies":[]},{"poster":"BigBellBrute","date":"2019-08-24T06:31:16.668+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dodging should be an automatic loss in ranked and should be 15 minutes in the sin bin in all un ranked games.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Inkling Commando","date":"2019-08-24T08:33:01.244+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"may i ask why you are talking about yourself?","replies":[]}]}
