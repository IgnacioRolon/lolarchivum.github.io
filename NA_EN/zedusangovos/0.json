{"poster":"ZedUsanGovos","date":"2017-11-28T17:17:09.339+0000","title":"Zed's New Lore","subforum":"Story, Art, & Sound","up_votes":25,"down_votes":3,"body":"~~Alright. This is uh... Well. Everyone knows Zed&#039;s old lore. Zed and Shen were rivals and the top of their class, Zed sought a way to beat Shen, used the shadows, was kicked out, yadda yadda came back, something happened in the temple, Zed killed his and Shen&#039;s master, Zed&#039;s order slaughters most of the students. It has a very specific timeline. According to this, Zed initially unlocked the shadows at a younger age. Now, here&#039;s the new lore.~~\n\n~~&quot;Utterly ruthless and without mercy, Zed is the leader of the Order of Shadow, an organization he created with the intent of militarizing Ionia&#039;s martial arts traditions to drive out Noxian invaders. During the war, desperation led him to unlock the secret shadow form&mdash;a malevolent spirit magic as dangerous and corrupting as it is powerful. Zed has mastered all of these forbidden techniques to destroy anything he sees as a threat to his nation, or his new order.&quot;~~\n\n~~I have no qualms about him being a badass malevolent ninja. But I do take issue with the timeline.~~\n\n~~Zed established the Order while exiled, and made the Kinkou Temple his base of operations. This new lore suggests he established it DURING the Noxus/Ionia war. Also, the establishment of the Order itself in the old lore would have to be before or after the Noxian Invasion, as the Kinkou would be too busy to deal with Zed&#039;s return. Which also means that the events of Jhin/Zed/Shen/Kusho would have to also take place before or after the Invasion.~~\n\n~~Zed named it the Order of Shadow because he already unlocked MOST of the shadow power and needed to return to the temple to get the box and reach his full potential. This new lore suggests he unlocked the shadows AFTER the establishment of the Order, and DURING the war.~~ \n\n~~_&quot;Zed has mastered all of these forbidden techniques **to** destroy anything he sees as a threat to his nation, **or** his new order.&quot;_ This syntax insinuates that he unlocked the shadows as a last resort to protect his already established Order of Shadow.~~\n\n~~Now, this also conflicts with Jhin&#039;s lore, as he plays a HUGE fucking role in Zed&#039;s transformation from straight A student to the dude he was in his lore. Jhin&#039;s &quot;art&quot; is what traumatizes Zed in the first place, leading him down a dark path, eventually to the Shadows. How does this fit in now? The new lore insinuates that Zed unwillingly unlocked the shadows, considering the use of &quot;desperation&quot;, which is usually used as a way to describe a last resort. This further insinuates that Zed shares the sentiments of Kusho, not wanting to use forbidden power. Whereas he initially had some doubts about it, as it was forbidden, but went ahead with it because he wanted Kusho&#039;s approval. So how does this work now? Zed seems to be his own entity here, not connected to Jhin or Shen. Why would he not be a part of the Kinkou here? What event took place that removed him from the scene? The original lore had him exiled because of the Shadows, but he now gains the shadows long after he branches off from the Kinkou.~~\n\n~~How would Kusho be impacted as well? Did Zed still kill Kusho? If so, why? Or if Kusho is actually alive here, then will Zed have a VO Update? Because his taunt towards Shen about being an orphan would be completely out of place.~~\n\n~~I understand that most of this may be explained in time, but as of what I&#039;ve seen, I&#039;m not a big fan of this new lore. His connection to the Kinkou was probably what made me relate to him, like, a lot. I related to his fall from a straight A to barely passing, I related to his angsty want for approval from a father figure, I felt for him when I read about his exile. And I understood why he&#039;d be as edgy as he is now. As well as why he and Syndra as well as he and Kayn would get along together. They all felt that they weren&#039;t who they could be because of the restrictions imposed upon them by their superiors. This new lore paints him as the Ra&#039;s al Ghul of League instead of the Red Hood he was.~~\n\n~~If Riot retains SOME level of consistency in the timeline in the full story, then I&#039;ll be fine with this, but so far, everything looks fucked.~~\n\n~~But what do you guys think of the lore in the context of continuity? D&#039;ya like the new approach or do you share my sentiments about retaining the initial timeline? Or do you simply just hate Zed and his old/new lore as a whole?~~\n\nEdit: I HAVE NEW INFORMATION. According to Rioter WAAARGHbobo, here's some new information. You may find it near the bottom. I suggest upvoting him like an ideal citizen should.\n\n>So as the guy who did this, and Jhin’s lore...\nThe character you love hasn’t changed.\nThis simply expands the timeline and shows how Zed’s descent can be understood from his own perspective.\nThis was timeline was actually done during Jhin, and the goal was to give Zed’s fall a slower, more human, less arch, trajectory.\nTimeline (rough from my phone):\nShen and Zed are students together and bros.\nZed is clearly the better, more talented student.\nKusho takes the two young teenagers undercover chasing “the golden demon”\nJhin crime scenes traumatized zed.

Ignore EVERYTHING else I'd said before. This pretty much explains most of the issues I had with the initial bio update. The wording really threw me off, and made me think it was a complete rewrite. It explains how exactly Zed was separated from the Kinkou, something that wasn't very well explained, as well as some other things. It even brings up something new! The Harrowing approaches Ionia, which does not bode well. Perhaps another Zed/Shen teamup? While searching for Jhin, who is now on his way to Zaun of all places (hm... perhaps he seeks out Urgot? Maybe Viktor?), they come upon the Mists.","replies":[{"poster":"WAAARGHbobo","date":"2017-11-28T18:07:55.288+0000","up_votes":68,"down_votes":2,"body":"So as the guy who did this, and Jhin’s lore...  \n\nThe character you love hasn’t changed. \n\nThis simply expands the timeline and shows how Zed’s descent can be understood from his own perspective.\n\nThis timeline was actually done during Jhin, and the goal was to give Zed’s fall a slower, more human, less arch, trajectory.\n\n\n Timeline (rough from my phone):\n\nShen and Zed are students together and bros. \nZed is clearly the better, more talented student. \n\nKusho takes the two young teenagers undercover chasing “the golden demon”\n\n Jhin crime scenes traumatized zed.

Like, he flat out REFUSED to use it during the war, and only did so out of pure desperation. It gave me a very faint tone reminding me of Varus' old lore, just without the vengeance, which I'm sorta 50/50 about. But it wasn't even the Varus tone that made me initially tilted, it was because it looked (to me, at least) as if you guys were gonna redo the Zed/Shen/Jhin story which I'd grown to love over my short year of playing this game, which worried me because that story, as well as Shurima's are my top two FAVORITE lores in the game.\n\nBut now that I have this knowledge... I'm starting to understand exactly what you guys meant in the short bio that was released. And I FUCKING LOVE IT. I kept telling some good friends of mine: \"Holy shit they turned Zed into Ra's Al Ghul instead of Red Hood I want to fucking die\", and now I have some amazing news to tell them.

He almost seems forgotten as everyone discusses about the Kinkou, Zed and Jhin - bit sad to see. :(\n\nHe's a prankster and said to be very energetic, perhaps he can represent the more light-hearted nature of the Kinkou better.

The new lore blurb seems to mention Kennen's association with the Spirit realm - curious to see what role Kennen plays here - perhaps interact with the Vastayans as a messenger from the Kinkou?\n\n{{champion:85}} ","replies":[]},{"poster":"SgtGenColKled","date":"2017-11-30T02:33:12.687+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=WAAARGHbobo,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=JjQEuhgJ,comment-id=00050000,timestamp=2017-11-29T06:54:14.667+0000)\n>\n> Yes on Akali.   She is important to the story.\n> \n> Kennen is a little up in the air. As an old kit and champ model, this makes reworking his place in this stiry/lore difficult— until he gets a reup slated.  He will get a new story and lore revamp from someone— but “I” avoided him because I didn’t want to risk major plot points changing if he changes. (Esp back when workingnon Jhin)\n\nThanks for the information on that.\n\nI hope you are sort of implying that Akali VGU might be coming up with this.  I would love to see more of her, especially as a potential student to both Shen and Zed.  I mean someone has to teach her while Shen is off doing Spirit World things and she probably has the violent drive to learn Shadow arts.","replies":[]},{"poster":"laststanding6","date":"2017-11-30T02:16:30.838+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you guys got any plans on updating lord jaximus' lore at some stage?
