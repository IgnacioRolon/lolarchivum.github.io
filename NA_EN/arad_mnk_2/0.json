I think the only way to deal with it is patience, it should do.\nHowever I have the same issue right now, again.\n\n@Targon I've been through that link also. Never submitted a ticket though.\nI'll try using the hextech repair tool to disable firewall and turn off ESET manually. Will tell the results.\n(A FEW MINUTES LATER)\nDoesn't work at all. Same issue.\n\nOne thing: it was supposed to crash, but now it doesn't even show the logo, it's now the same ol' RADS error.\n\nI've tried changing my DNS to 8.8.8.8 and Alternative DNS to 8.8.4.4, tried flushing my DNS, reseting winsock again, restarting 5 times, used a VPN, disabling ESET and my firewall and most importantly, waited a long time. No changes at all.\n\nAny ideas now? :3 Answered late because couldn't find my thread :/ I'm not used to these board system.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-14T18:48:22.897+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There could be a number of configurations that may be causing the problem. First, I'd recommend disabling ESET completely to see if it's blocking League entirely, even if exceptions for League are added. If that quick change doesn't resolve the issue, I suggest ensuring your local network settings are all compatible with League by working through our [connection troubleshooting guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues).\n\nLet me know if those steps caused any change.","replies":[]}]}
