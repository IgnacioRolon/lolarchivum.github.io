And while I was ok with her R2 being a reliable execute that, however, puts her in danger with no dashes left, the nerf is not that hard on it.\n\n> But if they do that, she'll require much more skill to play\n\nIf they do that, she will turn into a normal assassin: using full combo to kill someone and leave. Again, I would be ok with that, but Riot want her to be a \"sustained damage assassin\" that can kill people without using any huge cooldowns and uses those cooldowns mostly to survive/dodge/chase/finish rather than for just damage. Which is understandable(even if I don't agree with that), because a) thats how old Akali worked and b) there are no other champions that do it.\n\n> look at so many other changes such as Sylas or A-Sol or Ryze\n\nI didn't really play Sylas or Ryze, but Sol's mini-rework added some(well, maybe too much) counterplay to his push-roam strategy, decreased his best-case damage, and compensated it with better tools to survive/outplay/burst and made players no longer feel bad at maxing Q second.

E-R1, R1-E, R1-E shuriken, all that combined with W movespeed. If she is already close, she can use R1 to dodge things, to follow the flash over the wall or just to turn around and escape if things are not in her favor. Ult nerf kills most of these options, leaving her with either \"ult from 600 range to get close\" or \"get close with E and use ult to chase after flash/dash\". Not really a perfect nerf in my opinion, but its better than having none.\n\n> her R2 post nerf is slower than Amumu's Q\n\nThe skillshot or the Amumu himself? Either way, its not really too slow. She will have more trouble with mobile champions, and Im not sure if that's ok.\n\nAnyway, its just a first iteration of nerfs.
