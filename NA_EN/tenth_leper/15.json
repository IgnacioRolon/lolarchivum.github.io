Bilgewater is surprisingly ... handsome, Tyrant is nice and sinister, Northern front is really tough and determined, and the base has plenty of crows and the hand is neatly done.\r\n\r\nI don&#039;t miss the cane as much as I thought I would since you still conveyed age fairly well.\r\n\r\nI am concerned about the in game appearance of his ultimate though. I have only seen the base skin, but the look was way too understated and a bit off balance. Looked like he would fall over backward. I miss the hunched bird demon.\r\n\r\nAlso, I like the idea of the Eye for W, but please try to make his spells look as unlike vlad&#039;s as possible.\r\n\r\nAnyway, thanks for all the hard work. You are really talented people.","replies":[]}
