Why do summons give gold?","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Trying to avoid my usual verbosity, I was simply curious as to the reason champion placed destructibles give gold the the destroyer.\n\nI thought at first it might be because they zone people for a long period of time and needed to offset the cs loss of the opponent. Then I considered Orriana and Azir, who zone for similarly lengthy periods and provide the victim no such compensation.\n\nThen I thought it might be because many of them can block skillshots, causing people to waste mana killing them, so they needed money to buy more regeneration to overcome that or something. Then I realized baum and yasuo are things. Also, if the waste of resources were the main culprit then mobility spells and invulnerability/untargetability spells would be giving the opponent gold too when they prevented damage, cc, or whatever from having an effect despite being paid for.\n\nThen I thought it might be a holdover from dota, but with how recently Yorick was reworked and how many other ways league has diverged from those roots it seems unlikely.\n\nSo I gave up trying to figure out why summoning Champs give their opponents gold and thought I would simply ask. I am always enlightened and usually entertained by your responses anyway.\n\nThank you for reading.","replies":[{"poster":"Ryuyah","date":"2016-10-27T14:11:15.560+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"probably because you need an incentive other than not getting raped by malz voidlings to kill them\n\n/s","replies":[]},{"poster":"5000000000000000","date":"2016-10-27T01:03:31.953+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's coded as minions?","replies":[{"poster":"hhaavviikk","date":"2016-10-27T05:19:08.754+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"pretty sure zrot portal minons don't give gold though","replies":[]}]}]}
