I am curious as to whether people think a Lulu skin in the vein of nunu bot would be fun.\n\nI think lulu&#039;s whimsical personality coming from an inorganic metalic-voiced being would be delightful. Not dissimilar in tone from Grr of Zim fame.\n\nAs far as appearences, a ball cap is essential. Bigger and creepier eyes are better. Pix should be a helidrone with a screen at the front with a pixelated emoji face which changes when lulu is struck and when lulu&#039;s abilities are used, eg an angry face when offensive E is used or a trolling face when ult is used.\n\nI think the Q would need electrical effects, and the defensive use of E should have the Pix drone detach pieces of itself to different locations around the target and project a forcefield between those pieces. The polymorph could either be some sort of puppy Droid or perhaps a little remote controlled car.\n\nAny ideas or drawings?\n{{sticker:katarina-love}} ","replies":[]}
