Like Riven or Garren melee minions, Vlad or Urgot siege minions, Tristana or Veiger caster minions, Cho&#039;gath or Nautilus super minions etc.\r\n\r\nMinion stats would be standardized of course, the difference of riven and garren or whatever would be purely aesthetic.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of aesthetics, it is absolutely essential that the champ minions have helium style high pitched voices (they should make their usual sounds and lines when damaged or killed or such)\r\n\r\nThe players (as giant minions) I am not sure yet what their abilities would be (or if you should simply select a champion kit you want and this is also only aesthetic), but I do want them to appear to be upgraded by banner of command somehow, most likely by baron buff.\r\n\r\nThe main game play hook of the mode would be similar to black market brawlers, but instead of replacing minions in a lane you would be buying items for a specific minion type in a specific lane. For example you could give all mid lane Tristanas infinity edges.\r\n\r\nThat&#039;s about as far as I have taken the idea so far, but I wondered if anyone thought it sounded fun","replies":[]}
