The story manages to perfectly describe the Void from the point of view of someone who was directly effected by it: an all consuming abyss whose very essence defies the world it seeks to devour. Kassadin comes off as tired, the kind of tired that only terrible loss and never-ending struggle can bring. And yet he keeps going, defying the Void.

It's hinted enough, but it's not really confirmed. It matters because Kassadin actually has the same problem that old Varus had... He isn't really connected to anyone. \n\nLike, how is he connected to other champions? Whats does he want after he beats the void? I feel like he needs some kind of connection to someone otherwise he feels more like a side character...

Two huge growths stood on its shoulders, each with a mouth of crackling purple energy.  It was humanoid and, as its awful mask peeled back, indeed human.\n\n“Who... are you?” he whispered.\n\n“The Void Hunter,” the young woman behind the mask answered, “Who are you?”\n\n“Whom the desert knows,” he said.\n\nThe hunter’s eyes opened wide for a moment, and she trailed off, reciting the Shuriman words,“Kas sai a dyn.”\n\nKassadin slowly floated toward her, gesturing with a gloved hand, “It is a meaning I have kept by my side for years, even in this place.”\n\nShe asked, stepping up to him, “Who were you, before you came here?”\n\n“A merchant.  A tomb-robber.  A husband.  A father.”\n\nThey were only feet apart, now.  He could see her face clearly, and she could glimpse the eyes that lurked behind his goggles.  She extended her hand.  He took it.  \n\nAs a memory tugged at his mind, one came from her lips, “_My_ father.”\n\n“It...” Kassadin stared at her.\n\n“My name is Kai’Sa.  You are my father: Kassadin.”\n\nAs in the stories he had once told her as the fire crackled low by her bedside, their arms were around each other before they knew it.  For a moment that felt like an hour, father and daughter held one another, reunited.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"The DrBonjigollo","date":"2018-10-06T05:50:17.245+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Doctor Dyment,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=rv0QUomN,comment-id=00000001,timestamp=2018-10-06T03:49:40.432+0000)\n>\n> It really is fantastic.
