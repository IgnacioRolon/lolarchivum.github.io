Kayle may actually deserve the nerf,  however seriously it will disturb her damage. But I do not believe kallista does.\r\n\r\nAssuming there is no intention of removing Kallista&#039;s auto ad ratio penalty, could we buff BoRK for the sake of the people who  still build it, as they are predominantly attack speed fervor users? Alternatively a buff to Rage blade for those who _would_   use it if it were just a little bit better or less awkward would be appreciated.","replies":[]}
