Every time FB makes a change to the layout or features, people complain a ton, threaten to leave, etc. And then they stick around because there's really no other option. It's going to happen here, too. People blindly hate on the boards changes while refusing to actually learn the features. They threaten that it'll kill the forums entirely. Everybody will leave. But that's pretty much impossible, because if you want to feel like there's a chance that Riot will hear your voice, this will still be the best place to try.\n\nBut what gets me even more is that many of the new features that were added here are ones that people have clamored for a long time to have added to the forums. Not to mention that there's been a lot of interaction between Riot and the community (at least those who were wiling to give it a chance early on) in developing the thing. There are some features on here solely because they were asked for by the early testers. And there's still more in development.","replies":[{"poster":"MasterOfTheOrder","date":"2014-10-06T22:51:12.022+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just because there's no other option doesn't mean it's acceptable.\n\nThat's the most counter productive argument in existence.\n\nIt's basically translated to \"deal with it, we don't care if you don't like it.\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"PieCake","date":"2014-10-05T20:28:25.288+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"> because if you want to feel like there's a chance that Riot will hear your voice, this will still be the best place to try.\n\nHave you been on reddit? riot employees live there because the majority of the people there worship any red name.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MasterOfTheOrder","date":"2014-10-06T22:49:37.499+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's about the only widespread complaint that involves the complainer being ignorant and lazy.\n\nHow about we talk about crappy color schemes, the annoying side bar, the lack of ranked icons under a summers name, annoying reddit comment style, and the un-needed forced switch to these forums in the first place?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"AbodyHUN666","date":"2014-10-05T11:55:19.549+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"you can switch to the new posts too.
