It's tough sometimes to not fight back and defend yourself, but we're always in control of our own actions and you're able to simply mute others and report them in post-game if needed. Saying something in defense of yourself doesn't make those things okay, and calling the enemy team or your own teammates \"tarded\" is just something that cool. \n\nThis account has been through the normal escalation process with chat restrictions and then this 2 week ban. This isn't a perma, so you'll be back in the game before too long. Just remember to report these people who lash out at you in post game, and try your best not to fight back. It's a lot more satisfying to report and see that they were banned rather than get yourself punished along with them =(.","replies":[]}]}
