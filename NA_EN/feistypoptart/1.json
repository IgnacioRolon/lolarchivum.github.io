Most of the matchups that favor him are mages, which can easily deal with him if you don't mind a boring first 10-15 mins. Though it might seem shitty all you really have to do is just give up almost all of your lane dominance. Once he hits 6 you sit back and farm with abilities or wait for the wave to get to your tower. Deny his ability to make good roams by making sure to prioritize vision, ping whenever he goes missing even if you aren't sure he actually left, and hard push the wave every time he leaves. You are essentially starving him of a snowball by making sure he doesn't get any kills. Plus, at lower elos at least, the zed will probably get bored/annoyed because he cant fight you and he might try to dive you which can result as an easy kill if you play it right. Do this until you have enough for a zhonyas then try to roam and use your utility as a mage to peel for allies and get picks. That's just for mages, but most assassins have a pretty easy time against him. Champs like yasuo, Kat, and ekko can beat him with relative ease unless the zed is playing better than them.\n\n\nEdit: Im pretty sure most people aren't even reading the post, they just see someone that SLIGHTLY sides with zed not being gutted and they just have to downvote it and move on. :/","replies":[{"poster":"Madsin25","date":"2018-08-10T04:26:17.002+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can counterpick him easily and make his life hell.\n\nHowever counterpicking is not counterplay.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yenn","date":"2018-08-10T08:52:17.244+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=FeistyPoptart,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=myuWckgY,comment-id=,timestamp=2018-08-10T04:11:09.249+0000)\n>\n> Though it might seem shitty all you really have to do is just give up almost all of your lane dominance.

Let's assume it's a shitty Zed who can't kill you under your turret (spoiler: there are many immobile casters who can be safely dived 1v1 by a skilled Zed with no possible counter play, and even more who become diveable if he ever lands a double Q).\n\n> [{quoted}](name=FeistyPoptart,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=myuWckgY,comment-id=,timestamp=2018-08-10T04:11:09.249+0000)\n>\n> Deny his ability to make good roams by making sure to prioritize vision, ping whenever he goes missing even if you aren't sure he actually left, and hard push the wave every time he leaves.\n\nEvery time you go to ward, you're potentially walking into Zed. You can spend all of your gold on pinks, but you can't defend them, making it impossible to maintain vision. You can't push the wave unless you **know** he's gone; if he's not gone, he'll pop Ghostblade and kill you for leaving your turret. If he is roaming, you don't know until it's too late. If you ping on every wave, your team becomes desensitized to it and stops caring.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=FeistyPoptart,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=myuWckgY,comment-id=,timestamp=2018-08-10T04:11:09.249+0000)\n>\n> Do this until you have enough for a zhonyas then try to roam and use your utility as a mage to peel for allies and get picks.\n\nIf you rush Zhonya, you can't wave clear. You'll have to recall for mana often, and he'll just take your turret and/or roam while you're gone. Virtually no mage can fight Zed 1v1 even with Zhonya, so every time you roam, you're praying that he doesn't catch you in the river.\n\nThe rest of your post is irrelevant because the initial premise that you can maintain vision control and farm safely as long as you don't leave your turret are both completely wrong, and only apply to unskilled players.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ahpe","date":"2018-08-10T04:20:54.084+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/mobile/000/018/489/nick-young-confused-face-300x256-nqlyaa.jpg","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-08-10T04:34:09.400+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"The only counterplay to zed is avoiding him.\n\nThis is most easily achieved by banning him in champ select.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lethal Zedstér","date":"2018-08-10T05:28:19.588+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I agree, you just need to play passive rush tabi and zhonyas and he will not be able to kill you cuz armor is too op against him.

Sudden Impact, along with Serrated Dirk pretty much negates all of the armor on Ninja Tabi. Once he has Duskblade and Youmuu's, along with aforementioned Sudden Impact, the armor on Ninja Tabi and Zhonya's is almost completely useless. This is not to mention the fact that his passive damage benefits from the magic pen on Sudden Impact as well.\n\n3. His Ignite deals 50 - 505 TRUE damage.\n\nBy no means is armor \"too op against him\".","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Titanium70","date":"2019-10-11T17:14:51.422+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, from what you wrote:\n\nZed gets lane dominance by existing.
