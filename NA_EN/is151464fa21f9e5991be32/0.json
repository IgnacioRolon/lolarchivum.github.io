I mainly ask this because I would like to change the email from my NA account to my LAN account since the email on the NA lol account i never use is my \"main\" email and the email on my LAN account is not and id like to stop using this email its much easier not having more than one email. But the friend I moved in with seems to think ill get banned, he says hes seen people banned for moving and logging on from different locations, and he says if i were to move and change the email that would look super strange to Riot.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-21T03:46:25.020+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You definitely won't get banned for simply logging in from another location. At the very worst, if it looks super suspicious (as if you're being hacked) your account might be locked for protective reasons but only until you write in to verify yourself as the account creator. You should be free to change that email, and if you're having problems just reach out to us in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) for help.","replies":[{"poster":"IS151464fa21f9e5991be32","date":"2017-12-21T04:28:41.832+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cool, just wanted to make sure because ive had the account for a very long time and didnt want anything to happen to it over something like that.
