Or as your main. Or that it should be compulsory. But I think everyone, for their own good, should play 5-10 games as support, and 5-10 games as jungle a season, at least. Not mandatory, just by choice they should go and do it. And not as a troll pick, as a normal, meta support/jungler. These roles teach you so much about team play, objective play and reliance on your allies. On top of that, you will understand these roles better, be able to play with them better, rage at them less, and learn useful skills. You will probably get better at warding, playing safe and general map awareness.\r\n\r\nReal talk though. Autofill, like it or hate it, you will get support and jungle sometimes. I am a jungle main, but I picked up playing support a lot in normals, so that if I get autofilled to support, it&#039;s cool. Everyone, everyone should know how to support. It is a cornerstone role, you will be forced to play it sometimes, and it teaches you more about map awareness and warding than arguably any other role. Most people should know how to jungle, it is crucial to objectives and swaying lane balance. More importantly, you will know what a jungler must do, and how they function, so in your primary role in ranked, you can know what to expect from them, and how to work with them better.\r\n\r\nThis isn&#039;t to thrash anybody, or say any role is bad. It&#039;s just saying, autofill and good teamwork, demand that we all get better at support and jungle, because these are huge roles that function totally different from top carry, mid carry, adc carry last hitters. And if you don&#039;t know how to jungle or support, you can&#039;t just fudge it. It&#039;s not like a mid main getting top and still knowing the basics of laning and last hitting, picking somebody like swain, vlad or cass top to get by. It is a totally different aspect of the game. Learn it, for your good, your team&#039;s good, and your ELO.","replies":[{"poster":"TyrekGoldenspear","date":"2016-10-07T17:56:14.759+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"True that, I learned every role to a competent level, and now I dont even notice when I get autofilled.\n\nBecause of my time playing jungle, when I mid I instinctively know where the enemy jungler is going after a gank, and the general farm paths so I save on warding sides on the river I know they aren't.\n\nAfter playing support I have a much better consciousness of my ward cooldowns and general map awareness.\n\n+1 for another excellent post Dragon Lady.\n\nEDIT:\nBTW, have you had any luck with AP Shyvana?

Often times, unless you are in very high elo, you won't be getting punished or invaded because the enemy jungler doesn't really know what to do with jungle. Jungle isn't the role of \"farming things that aren't in lanes and ganking lanes\". Junglers aren't the laner's whores. Junglers are there to mainly secure objectives, provide vision that laner's can't because they have to keep their lanes in check, they are there to apply pressure to laners, even by not being visible to the enemy minimap. In general, jungle is a game of strategy much like chess and requires a lot of thought into how the lanes will play out, when is the optimal time to gank a lane (usually you look in lanes to see which way they are pushing) and where & when the enemy jungler will show up, as well as, which skirmishes you can win. It's really a role that isn't made by the player's individual mechanics as much as it is made by how experienced and smart the jungler is.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dolasaur","date":"2016-10-07T23:43:10.979+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1) Pick two junglers that are not super popular (i.e. Zac has a 50% ban rate now, so not a good choice). They should be different roles. A couple \"easier\" junglers from various roles: Amumu and Sejuani (tank), Skarner and Udyr (off-tank), Jarvan IV and Wukong (AD bruiser/initiator), Fiddlesticks (AP).\n\n2) Find a guide for your champ that gives you a reasonable idea of your jungle route, runes, masteries, and early buys. You don't need to buy runes to match up perfectly, but good runes can make the difference between a full clear and dying on your second camp.\n\n3) Start out in custom games- no pvp, no bots, no other people. Go through until you can clear as much of the jungle as is reasonable for your champ. If you die early or have to back super early in a pvp game, you won't learn as much as you should. So make sure you can do a \"normal\" clear for your champ without help.\n\nAnd you're ready for pvp! If you do do bot games, I'd avoid getting used to ganking them. The bad habits you can pick up from getting used to bot reactions to getting ganked are more severe than for laners, in my opinion.\n\nLast comment: There's a great guide on MOBAFire for general jungling. The specific details about the champions are 3.5 years old, but the general analysis style is great. If you enjoy reading, check out http://www.mobafire.com/league-of-legends/build/who-is-your-jungler-and-what-does-he-do-114118. Think about the points that are used to analyze different junglers (i.e. clear speed, pre-6 and post-6 ganks, etc.). Think about how you can capitalize on those strengths in your games as a jungler. And when you return to your primary roles, keep that information in mind too when deciding how to play. (\"My bot lane partner and I are super aggressive champs!

Not because I wanna steal his cs, but because I don't want them to give up a random kill into the enemy jungler and I want to deny the enemy top the wave. \n\nSo yeah, everyone should play jungle for a change, no matter how bad they are at it. Jungle forces you to have some game sense and is so much more about your strategy going into the game, rather than your mechanics on x champion.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Imperial Japan","date":"2016-10-08T14:52:39.095+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mained jungle for a while and I play support occasionally","replies":[]},{"poster":"FishOfHonor","date":"2016-10-08T09:53:33.655+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Great post indeed .

I'm just now getting more comfortable in mid. I used to loathe that position because I could never find a champion that fit my playstyle there. \n\nPicked up Zyra mid and now I'm in love <3 \n\nBut I agree with your post. Everyone should try out every position.
