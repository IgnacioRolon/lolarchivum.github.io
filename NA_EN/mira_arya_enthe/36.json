Damn... it&#039;s almost like they&#039;re utilizing the champion&#039;s strengths, weaknesses, design and mechanics better. To strategize against their enemies better.\n\nHate to tell you, but until you have literally maxed out the potential of the game&#039;s engine on how your champion can be refined with a perfectly calculated build and absolutely omniscience over what is happening in the game with perfect decision making. Then you haven&#039;t reached the peak of potential for your champion.\n\nAs long as a Diamond Garen player is better than a Silver Garen player, then he isn&#039;t a skilless champion.\n\nLeague is very easy to pick up, hard to master in general. And only a few select individuals have mastered a couple specific champions to nearly their peak potential.

I feel if players were more rooted in decision making rather than mechanics there would be far less \"league of throws\". Cause one downside of when you have all these mechanics down you go towards \"What can I do\" instead of \"What will my opponent do\".

You going to ward in the enemy jungle, but you have no wards in the area, information about the enemy jg's wherabouts, or flash. This is probably a bad idea. You get caught in 1 v 3. \n\n* If you are playing Leblanc and have the mechanical skill then there is a chance you can still get away by double dashing over a wall or juking. \n* If you are playing Ashe, you're probably dead.\n\nYou can replace Leblanc with Zed, Yasuo, Lee, most champions that are considered mechanically intense; and you can replace Ashe as well. The former group will often times have windows of opportunity granted by their kits if they have the mechanical skills to execute it, while the latter probably will not (as much). This adds to the weight of the decision making for the latter group in that their fundamental decision making matters more.\n\nEDIT: A better example might be Blitz vs Thresh. Thresh's kit allows him a lot more usefulness if messes up his hook. He still has flay, lantern, and his ult. His power is spread throughout his kit, but he requires some degree of mechanics to access all of that power (Using QW to pull you over one wall and your ally over two, flaying the minion wave for a surprise pull, etc). Blitz doesn't exactly have that. An enormous part of his kit's power in invested in a single, simple ability and whether or not and/or how he uses it can make or break it for him (and his team!)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TheBigfoot","date":"2016-11-06T16:20:53.473+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"An example would be Annie vs. Yasuo.
