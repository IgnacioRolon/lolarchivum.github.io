Junglers with hard CC (stuns, knockups) and good damage are usually great early game gankers like Jax, Zac, Vi, Ivern, and Elise, especially when they have a laner who also has some form of CC or hard CC that can cause a stun lock or keep the enemy from being able to escape. Other jungle champs like Yi, Shaco, Evelyne, and Kha, have a much harder time getting early ganks (taking out the skill of the summoner) unless a good opportunity is created by your team or bad plays by the enemy team. These assassin's require the laner to possess more of the CC so that their high damage can assist in a gank. Setup is definitely key to any early game gank or ganks in general.\n\nTechnically all junglers are \"good\" at ganking as long as the opportunity is available however damage output and CC are the usual deciding factor for a successful gank. Early game is difficult for some junglers like Sej, Maoaki, and Nunu due to their general tankiness over damage. Although they may posses good CC they don't add as much to the overall kill potential. These champs tend to clear camps and farm up for their ults to help in a gank. Before WW rework he was the poster child for this statement as it was gank at 6 or bust for him (nocturne is similar however his fear and damage make him still a solid early ganker).\n\nTL:DR - Setup, CC, and good damage output are the recipe for success for a gank early or in general.\n\nI hope this helped answer your question/thought.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Mira Arya Enthe","date":"2017-03-13T03:23:59.428+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Understandable, this simply means the jungler is not playing well.

The issue with this is that some people seek to become offended and report at the drop of a hat, and others don't. The issue is that the ban bot (and btw, not a single ban is reviewed by a person, I can prove this, so if you are curious feel free to ask) doesn't discriminate between these two. A person who spam reports is considered just as much as a person who reports only the most toxic players. When humans actually reviewed cases in the Tribunal, Riot would punish players for spam reporting by diminishing the impact of those reports, and even BANNING players who were found to systemically submit false reports (happened to a friend of mine).\n\n>Firstly, citation?

Next.\n\n>Afaik the feedback only occurs when a player receives a permanent ban. \n\nWrong. Look at all the false bans that have come out on these forums (usually for cheating, but the system works the same way) and how horribly players are treated when they try to protest. It takes them literally weeks if not months to get their accounts back for offenses that they provably did not commit, and some of these cases were the results of actual account hacking.\n\n>Also, just show your reform card. If you want to use personal experience then do it properly without leaving anything out.\n\nI have seen what happens when people's reform cards hit this forum. They are subject to the absolute worst kind of ad hominem arguments the world has ever seen, and raked over the coals without so much as an ounce of context. I will not be doing this, as I believe that the context of my words are equally important to my words themselves. I was confrontational, I do not deny this, but I was confrontational in the face of extreme adversity, and for Riot to actually claim that \"context doesn't matter\" even in the face of all the shit that happened to PewDiePie is just fucking frightening.\n\n>What do you expect? Should Riot hook people up with therapists for mommy issues if they punish them for saying \"i fckd ur mom\"? What exactly do you think would reasonable and practical at the same time?\n\nYES, THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I WANT. How many reports do you think are lodged for legitimately toxic offenses? I would bet less than half, and that's a fairly liberal estimate. The rest are filed because one person simply didn't like the other, and they happened to say something like \"fuck you\" in chat. TECHNICALLY, this is bannable, but this is NOT what actually caused the offense. Riot is, in effect, banning players like me on a technicality, not on real offenses. People do not generally like me, as I come off as very abrasive and confrontational, and I have 0 tolerance for bullshit.

The ban was temporary and has long since expired. But I'll tell you exactly the line that got me banned:\n\n>/all: please report my team, they are harassing me and accusing me of trolling\n\nThe joke being that I was playing support pantheon AFTER I ACTUALLY ASKED THEM IF THEY WERE COOL WITH IT.\n\nThe fact that I even spoke in all chat to try for some small amount of catharsis triggered a 2 week ban. That's logical. The game was already lost, and had long since devolved into a toxic mess due to the rampant accusations of trolling by my teammates and me telling our jungler that if he was going to levy such accusations that he should at least know how to gank.\n\nAnd the proof that they don't review punishments is that I received my ban at ~12:30am, which was MINUTES (3-5) after the final game on my reform ticket ended. First, no one is even reviewing at that time. Second, 3-5minutes is simply NOT enough time for even a shit review of chat logs, hence, it was done entirely by an automated system. This is fact. Fact with which you simply cannot argue. And if you don't believe me, just sit back and try to remember the last time you got a notification about a player you reported getting banned. It probably was probably only a couple of minutes after the game in which you reported said player. Fact is, Riot does NOT review ANY of their bans. And based on the number of false permabans I see contested on the forums and ultimately overturned after a lengthy and frankly unacceptable process, I have a strong feeling that these are largely handled by the banbot, as well.\n\nLiterally all of the problems with the system would be solved by bringing back the Tribunal. As it stands, players (like me) who show enough competitive drive to criticize teammates' performances and not be willing to deal with bullshit and trolling are being utterly purged from this game, resulting in an ever increasing cesspool of casual shit players. I played for a couple years with the Tribunal, and they were simply not as strict, despite what Riot Games claims. Also, the Tribunal could clearly see the context and rule based on the ENTIRE case, not just the evidence that showed guilt. The only \"problem\" with the Tribunal is that it did take quite some time to hand out the ban, but if time is the only price for true and rational justice, then I have absolutely no problem with that. \n\nA system that punishes 1 innocent person is infinitely worse than one that lets 10 guilty ones go free, and that is the basis of virtually every first world justice system in the fucking world, except for this bullshit that Riot has given us.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gregor Gysi","date":"2017-03-18T09:58:44.643+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MonkeyMadness,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Yiq01Rbs,comment-id=000d000100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2017-03-18T08:54:26.340+0000)\n>\n> It&#x27;s pretty bad, Riot is incredibly unclear on the types of behavior that even qualify as a ban, short of saying &quot;negativity&quot;. The issue with this is that some people seek to become offended and report at the drop of a hat, and others don&#x27;t. The issue is that the ban bot (and btw, not a single ban is reviewed by a person, I can prove this, so if you are curious feel free to ask) doesn&#x27;t discriminate between these two. A person who spam reports is considered just as much as a person who reports only the most toxic players. When humans actually reviewed cases in the Tribunal, Riot would punish players for spam reporting by diminishing the impact of those reports, and even BANNING players who were found to systemically submit false reports (happened to a friend of mine).\n\nI was talking about the amount of logs that they provide when banning someone - and that amount is alright imo.\n\nGo ahead and post proof seeing how all perm bans are supposedly reviewed.\n\nAnd that is wrong. Reports are weighted based on accuracy. That's why I get so many feedbacks, my reports are challenger level ( ;) ).\n\n> I&#x27;ve never gotten one after Lyte and his automations took over. Next.\n\nQuite a few people who complained have quoted those emails. Do you have a problem with your email?\n\n> Wrong. Look at all the false bans that have come out on these forums (usually for cheating, but the system works the same way) and how horribly players are treated when they try to protest. It takes them literally weeks if not months to get their accounts back for offenses that they provably did not commit, and some of these cases were the results of actual account hacking.\n\nNo, cheating and toxicity work entirely differently and claiming otherwise doesn't make sense. The proof for toxicity (logs) is much more accessible and easier to process than proof for cheating. \nWrong bans are always for cheating/sharing and never for toxicity. The issue you are talking about is completely different from our topic.\n\n> I have seen what happens when people&#x27;s reform cards hit this forum. They are subject to the absolute worst kind of ad hominem arguments the world has ever seen, and raked over the coals without so much as an ounce of context. I will not be doing this, as I believe that the context of my words are equally important to my words themselves. I was confrontational, I do not deny this, but I was confrontational in the face of extreme adversity, and for Riot to actually claim that &quot;context doesn&#x27;t matter&quot; even in the face of all the shit that happened to PewDiePie is just fucking frightening.\n\nJust do it. I can't take you seriously otherwise.\nThe PDP comparison doesn't make sense at all, this is not a media problem, this is not about anyone calling you a racist/fascist, this is simply about whether you (as an example for a supposedly unrighteous ban) deserved the ban or not.\n\n> YES, THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I WANT. \n\nWhew\n\n> How many reports do you think are lodged for legitimately toxic offenses? I would bet less than half, and that&#x27;s a fairly liberal estimate. The rest are filed because one person simply didn&#x27;t like the other, and they happened to say something like &quot;fuck you&quot; in chat.\n\nAgain, it seems that you are not aware of the fact that reports are actually weighted and people who report based on sympathy won't have valuable reports. I highly doubt that 1 \"fuck you\" get's you banned because I've never gotten banned/restricted even once despite bantering quite a bit.\n\n > TECHNICALLY, this is bannable, but this is NOT what actually caused the offense. Riot is, in effect, banning players like me on a technicality, not on real offenses. People do not generally like me, as I come off as very abrasive and confrontational, and I have 0 tolerance for bullshit. \n\nMost people do not like you? Jesus, mute yourself and you will not only stop getting banned but also rise elo. People play so much worse when you stress them out.\n\n> This puts me at odds with many people that don&#x27;t actually take the time to get to know me (which is not possible during a 30 minute game), but this is NOT toxic.

Also, it seems like you are pretty aware of why you are such a negative influence in your games, I don't see how that would fix it.\nAnd just show your logs, I really want to know how that \"technicality\" looks like.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Troll for Trump","date":"2017-03-12T22:04:53.943+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"*goes to help*\n*loses xp and gold because wave is constantly pushed to their turret and jg isn't helping*\n*turret loses more hp*\nIf you're behind, then what you do is farm under turret, correct?
