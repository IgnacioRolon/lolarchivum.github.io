In the past, if the enemy got Baron, had a large lead or things were going bad, I remember people spamming &quot;Just defend!&quot; in chat, the strategy was to attempt to defend your base until Baron wore off or the enemies made some mistake of you could fight on advantageous grounds, etc.\n\nThat doesn&#039;t exist anymore. Toxic bullshit like Zz&#039;Rot, and the fact that Baron/Dragon(s) are so strong, plus the increased value of jungle camps, makes a defensive turtle worthless. Even if your team has good waveclear and poke, and good counter engagement, if you defend the enemy will just multiple their lead by a thousand percent off of the absurd jungle camps, grab free Inferno/Elder drakes, Barons, bar you in with Zz&#039;Rots that do a billion damage to your turret if you miss one minion, that you cannot counterplay without first fighting them. But even if you do fight them the Zz&#039;Rot keeps pumping out minions during that fight.\n\nOverall, defense is no longer possible in this game. Stalling tactics are no less strategic than team fighting or split pushing. It is another aspect of the game that has vanished. This in my opinion is more responsible for snowball than damage creep, lack of tanks, first tower blood or even Dragons(by themselves). \n\nI remember clearly how before, if your team was behind, you could turtle up. Let three carries soak off of three lanes exp, keep your tank/support around for counter engage and just wait out the bad situation. Which forced the enemy to siege you down. If they engaged it was a high risk for them with the reward of a win, but you had plenty of opportunity to win that engagement with counter engagement and turret advantage. \n\nNow no interaction is even needed from them. If you DARE focus on defense, Baron is now so strong, Elemental/Elder drakes now exist, Zz&#039;Rot now exists and jungle farm is so valuable, that they can make their small victory/lead into a game ending victory/lead with minimal interaction and almost no counterplay. \n\nWhat do you all think? Do neutral objectives + Zz&#039;Rot make defense too ineffective and non-interactive lead increasing too effective?\n\nBecause in my opinion, no other factor contributes to the snowball meta more than removing the primary strategy for when you are behind. Yes, contributes more than even damage creep.","replies":[{"poster":"dunder kill","date":"2017-02-22T08:55:11.360+0000","up_votes":37,"down_votes":9,"body":"Because there was a time where \"just defend\" was the meta.

This in my opinion is more responsible for snowball than damage creep, lack of tanks, first tower blood or even Dragons(by themselves). \n> \n> I remember clearly how before, if your team was behind, you could turtle up. Let three carries soak off of three lanes exp, keep your tank/support around for counter engage and just wait out the bad situation. Which forced the enemy to siege you down. If they engaged it was a high risk for them with the reward of a win, but you had plenty of opportunity to win that engagement with counter engagement and turret advantage. \n> \n> Now no interaction is even needed from them. If you DARE focus on defense, Baron is now so strong, Elemental/Elder drakes now exist, Zz&amp;#039;Rot now exists and jungle farm is so valuable, that they can make their small victory/lead into a game ending victory/lead with minimal interaction and almost no counterplay. \n> \n> What do you all think? Do neutral objectives + Zz&amp;#039;Rot make defense too ineffective and non-interactive lead increasing too effective?\n> \n> Because in my opinion, no other factor contributes to the snowball meta more than removing the primary strategy for when you are behind. Yes, contributes more than even damage creep.\n\ndefending is still possible just a lot harder to pull off and requires a lot more game knowledge than it used to","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ahristocats","date":"2017-02-22T08:54:13.235+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"congrat friend, you realised that the game is shit now","replies":[{"poster":"Mira Arya Enthe","date":"2017-02-22T09:13:52.465+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I made the \"League, then vs now\" post that reached 350+ upvotes.
