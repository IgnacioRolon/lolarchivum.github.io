I immediately picked up Xerath, Malz and Leona because they looked like badasses. Anyway, I played Leona AD mid like an idiot thinking I needed to buy a sword, shield, armor, boots, necklace and sunfire cap *facepalm*. I played MMOs before LoL forgive me. Anyway, once I learned she was a support I moved to bottom lane with her, I also bought Soraka and Taric. I grew to love support, so much that when I bought two ADCs it was the ones who were high utility, one secondary labeled as a support, Ashe and Sivir.\n\nNow mostly I liked mid, because Xerath and Malz were badasses. But being the accommodating gal I am, I have always played a ton of support and ADC as I was always willing to fill, and still am. I have to say, some of my favorite games in LoL have been playing as a support or ADC, the feeling of mutual benefit, cooperation and team play. Both of these classes count on their teams, and if their teams protect them(in the case of ADC and squishy supports) or bring the hurting for them(in the case of peel/tank support), they return a lot of value to their team.\n\nTo date, my favorite bot laners are Ashe, Leona, Sivir, Soraka, Nami, Morgana and Nautilus. \n\nThat said, during S6 I played almost no bot lane, because I was trying to do some stuff in ranked and earn my mastery points on Shyvana I missed out on due to a 1 year break from LoL during late S5 and early S6. Now returning to bot lane I am utterly miserable. Here are the things I have found frustrating.\n\n1. Jhin has been excessively meta since post release buffs, we went through this with Lucian, only Jhin hasn&#039;t been gutted. I am glad for that because I dislike champion gutting, but for the love of Urf he wins 25% of all LoL matches, he is present in 50%+ of all League games and wins 50%+ of those. Thankfully this appears to be being addressed, I sure hope it does enough considering most lanes right now are Jhin/Brand, Jhin/MF, Jhin/Malz, Jhin/Vel&#039;Koz, Jhin/Zyra, Varus/Janna(Except when I have a ban as I always ban Jhin or Varus). Which brings me to the next reason I hate playing bot lane anymore.\n\n2. Mage supports. So I love niche things and off meta, I was all for defending that Singed support guy even though I&#039;d never want to play with him. I tried silly crud like AP Shyvana and I have played 4 games as Ashe mid recently, winning 3 of them. But the mage support thing bugs me, here is why. Mage supports trivialize real supports while also adding to damage bloat. Real supports, with the exception of some niche off meta picks, don&#039;t do well in other lanes. Even when they do, Riot nerfs that gameplay style(Lulu top, Janna mid, Sona mid, Bruiser Soraka etc). Supports are mutually beneficial with ADCs as they do well sharing lane, covering one another&#039;s weaknesses and while one is the most gold hungry class in the game the other needs almost none. Mages however, go mid, top, jungle(lol). No mention of Ziggs ADC because that is a specific niche. These mages should be balanced around scaling instead of base damage so they can go in their intended lane, instead of pushing supports out of bot lane. Because why pick Soraka who can keep her ADC topped off, has a nice teamfight heal ult and a decent poke. When you can pick Vel&#039;Koz and still have peel, harass so hard the enemies practically cannot farm, get free kills post 6 with your ult because many ADCs are too slow to get out of it(god forbid you buy a Rylai&#039;s) and be super relevant carry late game without even having to farm and risk solo laning. Supports deserve a place in this game, if Riot isn&#039;t going to remove mages from bot lane, they better plan on letting Lulu go top again.\n\n3. Absurd Snowball. This was always a thing in bot lane, but with damage creep and issues such as mage supports above, plus the Caitlyn. Playing safely at your tower to farm is harder than ever. In the old days if I was behind in bot lane as ADC or Support we could retreat to our tower and neatly farm up, now the enemies could dive us but it was high risk, they could poke us but as strong as Sona and old Caitlyn&#039;s power was it doesn&#039;t compare to dancing around 5 traps while trying to dodge flame pillars and stuns from Brand. So at this point the high snowball in botlane has become absurdly high, especially when jungle has so much influence over bot lane and can dive those towers at 1/2 the risk it use to be. Previously we could also sacrifice our T1 tower(a normal strat if you gave a few kills and could not sustain your lane back then) so we could farm at T2 and partake in team objectives. Due to FTB and the overall snowball in League sacrificing a tower is now just as suicidal as defending it when behind has always been.\n\n4. Lack of Agency as a traditional ADC until 30+ minutes. This use to not be a problem, as the average game was 35-45 minutes and fewer early game champions existed, ADCs also powerspiked on an IE alone. Now with most games being shorter, I either need an earlier but milder power window or I am useless. This made me resort to playing ranged duelist bruiser Ashe mid(counters the hell out of AD assassins if you rush Tabi, PD and DD lel), just so I feel I have some laning agency. Enemy ADC/Support combo counters you or is a bully? 10 deaths by 10 minutes. Enemy jungler decides to properly gank your lane? 10 deaths by 10 minutes. Enemy playing a Lethality or early powerspike ADC/Mage support? 10 deaths by 10 minutes. Meanwhile if luck favors you or champion picks, the opposite happens. I feel like I have no worth on a traditional DPS ADC until I have completed a minimum of 3 items, which only ever happens if my team snowballs. But if my team snowballs they end by 25-30 minutes anyways so I never get to use said items...\n\n5. Lack of ability to ward. This mostly affects support, and while some supports have a little more early game agency they do not have the ability to properly ward. This is largely responsible for jungle ganks being so strong. As a jungle main I can literally just walk into lane on Shyvana 50% of the time because their wards don&#039;t have enough up time. Why even take sweeper? Oh yeh, because if I have sweeper I can basically deny their entire team vision until the support gets a sightstone(which thankfully some supports do). This affects more than just bot lane, but it feels especially bad on support, where I remember games of placing 60-70 wards in S2. Granted, Supports back then were in a worse design state and were basically ward mules mid-late game. That said it is too far the opposite now. Warding trinkets need to be looked at. Control wards are not the answer either, Control wards are a snowball mechanic, the team who is ahead can protect and destroy them, the team who is behind would literally just be being baited if they tried. I buy them, but they are only ever useful in lanes where my team is ahead.\n\n6. I don&#039;t feel like I can protect my ADC as *most* traditional supports. As a support I always use to feel powerful at protecting my ADC early game. Now, supports are propped up by a crutch set of items anybody can buy. Mage &#039;supports&#039; with low scalings and high base damage can buy the same items as a support, often earlier due to having more gold from harass and kills, and keep their ADC alive just as good as many supports could. Instead of propping supports up with Redemption, Locket and other support items, why don&#039;t we baseline buff traditional supports who are weak, they deserve it. In exchange these items could see their actives toned down just a little. Currently however, before the purchase of these items, I feel helpless on Soraka, Leona and many other traditional supports to save my ADC from the 4 man ganks coming bot lane all the time, thank heavens for the teleport nerf or it would be 5 man. I can only do so much pre-six with a single target stun, my E and exhaust on Leona. I feel helpless to do that which is literally my job.\n\n7. ~~Ranged top laners ruining the game~~ Bot also has the same problem as top lane, except instead of short range vs melee, it is long range vs short range. You can be denied out of huge amounts of farm and lane positioning just through the endless basic attacks from an ADC who is longer range than you. I don&#039;t blame the players however, the people playing Ashe into shorter ranged ADCs and Caitlyn into Ashe are just doing what they find effective. This is a game balance issue where range isn&#039;t counterable enough and/or isn&#039;t accounted for enough in power budgeting. It isn&#039;t as bad as top lane(because you can still use your range to farm under your tower without minion blocking and some shorter ranged ADCs have high reward mechanics for success) and has always been an issue in bot lane, but I felt it worth noting. Even on Ashe who use to be considered long range, and especially on Sivir or early game Kog&#039;Maw, facing a champion like Caitlyn or Jhin(effective range) or Varus(effective range) is just very frustrating. At least Jinx has to expend mana and power push the lane to use her full range. Again, this isn&#039;t a major issue, and would probably go back to being okay if things like snowball, mage supports and junglers tower diving weren&#039;t so toxic at this time. But I just threw it in here because I like 7 more than 6.\n\nOverall I am really saddened and disheartened trying to play bot lane right now. Between Jhin(and Varus) in every single game, mage supports, snowball, jungler power, lack of wards, extremely slow scaling and lack of agency. The lane is just miserable, unless you are a meta sheep or somebody who happened to main Jhin, Varus, MF or a mage support prior to this period, you are assured to have a lot of frustrating games.\n\nI really hope Riot looks at bot lane in the near future, between the problems with jungle, top lane still being an island of ~~hard counter wins~~ minimal value and the state of bot lane at this time, I might just return to being a mid laner. It seems to be the only safe place to play the game, as a mid mage with sufficient range to stay safe.\n\nThis isn&#039;t to say I don&#039;t think Riot is trying, or that I feel the situation is hopeless. It is merely outlining some of my complaints about playing bot lane, and why I don&#039;t enjoy it anymore.\n\nI just want to see more traditional ADCs and supports again.","replies":[{"poster":"Speeedy","date":"2017-03-01T17:47:15.768+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"as a bot lane main, if you dont play lethality you are putting yourself at a disadvantage automatically since you cannot outscale the {{item:3142}} with an IE. the buff to LW helped but still traditional ADC as I like to play in ranked is just not good anymore due to tanks and how effective leathlity is. \n\nYou forgot 1 major point of people dont know how to play support so the lane is hope your autofill isn't worse than their autofill (especially in low elo). I like to play adc/mid but when I am autofilled support i tend to get my adc 3-4 kills within the first 10 min but then they dont know how to farm and usually have like 30 cs. Bot lane is by far the least influential role in the game right now especially if you are behind. I have yet to figure out what to do to make a comeback because you die so fast and deal no damage. Then you get heavily flamed all game and get called terrible. I had a mid yesterday who died 8 times in 10 min and somehow i got blamed for not roaming by top mid and jungle. When we had a consistent 2v2 lane in the bot the entire time minus backs to buy (everyone bot lane was 0/0/0 @ 10 min)","replies":[{"poster":"DeusVult","date":"2017-03-02T03:38:23.759+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"IE does outscale lethality, it just takes 3-4 items to do so, whereas every lethality item is effective immediately, but still becomes even more powerful when stacked on top of each other","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2017-03-01T16:35:41.210+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"I can't really see Jhin being nerfed more than he has since there was a point where Cait and Vayne had high winrate and playrates (like near 30% playrate) and didn't get nerfed at all.","replies":[{"poster":"Mira Arya Enthe","date":"2017-03-01T16:52:55.199+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"Vayne was nerfed, her Q damage was reduced and there was something else I cannot quite remember.

When she could stack with her W and R, it was obvious her new identity was a more focused DPS slow ADC, just like she was pre-rework. Now I can't decide if I am suppose to poke to death with the mediocre-damage W, try to stack some Qs (and die, of course) or ult and pretty much not participate in a fight beyond that.\n\nWe need to decide if we want games to be back to longer amounts of time, or if we want adcs to be more relevant earlier. And to be honest, relevant for what? I think we should have them be more relevant for tank killing and tower pushing, so that adc isn't the oppressive role. I feel like lethality is honestly the intermediary for what would be a game without crit. You have to have some way of dealing enough damage, and lethality would possibly give poke adcs and the dps adcs relevancy in most metas.\n\nBut of course, Riot likes to sit in a retirement home all day instead of actually trying to make this game pleasurable to play.

Jhin has been excessively meta since post release buffs, we went through this with Lucian, only Jhin hasn&amp;#039;t been gutted. I am glad for that because I dislike champion gutting, but for the love of Urf he wins 25% of all LoL matches, he is present in 50%+ of all League games and wins 50%+ of those. Thankfully this appears to be being addressed, I sure hope it does enough considering most lanes right now are Jhin/Brand, Jhin/MF, Jhin/Malz, Jhin/Vel&amp;#039;Koz, Jhin/Zyra, Varus/Janna (Except when I have a ban as I always ban Jhin or Varus). Which brings me to the next reason I hate playing bot lane anymore.\n> \n\nYea, it kinda goes with the problem that the only way to fight range is with more range (like fighting fire with fire) which is why {{champion:110}} and {{champion:115}} bot lane are so popular because they can outrange these 2 assholes {{champion:51}} and {{champion:202}}.\n\n\n> 2. Mage supports. So I love niche things and off meta, I was all for defending that Singed support guy even though I&amp;#039;d never want to play with him. I tried silly crud like AP Shyvana and I have played 4 games as Ashe mid recently, winning 3 of them. But the mage support thing bugs me, here is why. Mage supports trivialize real supports while also adding to damage bloat. Real supports, with the exception of some niche off meta picks, don&amp;#039;t do well in other lanes. Even when they do, Riot nerfs that gameplay style(Lulu top, Janna mid, Sona mid, Bruiser Soraka etc). Supports are mutually beneficial with ADCs as they do well sharing lane, covering one another&amp;#039;s weaknesses and while one is the most gold hungry class in the game the other needs almost none. Mages however, go mid, top, jungle(lol). No mention of Ziggs ADC because that is a specific niche. These mages should be balanced around scaling instead of base damage so they can go in their intended lane, instead of pushing supports out of bot lane. Because why pick Soraka who can keep her ADC topped off, has a nice teamfight heal ult and a decent poke. When you can pick Vel&amp;#039;Koz and still have peel, harass so hard the enemies practically cannot farm, get free kills post 6 with your ult because many ADCs are too slow to get out of it(god forbid you buy a Rylai&amp;#039;s) and be super relevant carry late game without even having to farm and risk solo laning. Supports deserve a place in this game, if Riot isn&amp;#039;t going to remove mages from bot lane, they better plan on letting Lulu go top again.\n> \n\nHoly fucking shit, yes, this is a fucking problem and Riot doesn't do shit (except balancing those mage at bot lane despite being mid laners).\n\nI mean, this is no longer an off meta pick, they became the best support and are fucking aggravating to play against. They can fuck up in lane but they just need to ult and suddently, you lost the fight. And you know what Riot should also do? Increase the price of both {{item:3151}} and {{item:3116}} (around the same price as {{item:3165}}) but also increase the dmg. This means that unless they get really fed, they won't be able to get their cores items and will be useless for a long time if behind. And you wouldn't need to nerf them like they did with Malz.\n\n> 3. Absurd Snowball. This was always a thing in bot lane, but with damage creep and issues such as mage supports above, plus the Caitlyn. Playing safely at your tower to farm is harder than ever. In the old days if I was behind in bot lane as ADC or Support we could retreat to our tower and neatly farm up, now the enemies could dive us but it was high risk, they could poke us but as strong as Sona and old Caitlyn&amp;#039;s power was it doesn&amp;#039;t compare to dancing around 5 traps while trying to dodge flame pillars and stuns from Brand. So at this point the high snowball in botlane has become absurdly high, especially when jungle has so much influence over bot lane and can dive those towers at 1/2 the risk it use to be. Previously we could also sacrifice our T1 tower(a normal strat if you gave a few kills and could not sustain your lane back then) so we could farm at T2 and partake in team objectives. Due to FTB and the overall snowball in League sacrificing a tower is now just as suicidal as defending it when behind has always been.\n> \n\nYea, the towers area a fucking joke, 4 man ganks happens wayyy too often. And of course, not being able to farm proprely because look, fucking Caitlyn put 5 traps under our tower and we can't do shit about it.\n\n> 5. Lack of ability to ward. This mostly affects support, and while some supports have a little more early game agency they do not have the ability to properly ward. This is largely responsible for jungle ganks being so strong. As a jungle main I can literally just walk into lane on Shyvana 50% of the time because their wards don&amp;#039;t have enough up time. Why even take sweeper? Oh yeh, because if I have sweeper I can basically deny their entire team vision until the support gets a sightstone(which thankfully some supports do). This affects more than just bot lane, but it feels especially bad on support, where I remember games of placing 60-70 wards in S2. Granted, Supports back then were in a worse design state and were basically ward mules mid-late game. That said it is too far the opposite now. Warding trinkets need to be looked at. Control wards are not the answer either, Control wards are a snowball mechanic, the team who is ahead can protect and destroy them, the team who is behind would literally just be being baited if they tried. I buy them, but they are only ever useful in lanes where my team is ahead.\n> \n\nThe thing is, sightstone needs a buff: cheaper or another upgrate or actual good stats or recharge itself without the need of backing AND more range.\n\n\n> 6. I don&amp;#039;t feel like I can protect my ADC as *most* traditional supports. As a support I always use to feel powerful at protecting my ADC early game. Now, supports are propped up by a crutch set of items anybody can buy. Mage &amp;#039;supports&amp;#039; with low scalings and high base damage can buy the same items as a support, often earlier due to having more gold from harass and kills, and keep their ADC alive just as good as many supports could. Instead of propping supports up with Redemption, Locket and other support items, why don&amp;#039;t we baseline buff traditional supports who are weak, they deserve it. In exchange these items could see their actives toned down just a little. Currently however, before the purchase of these items, I feel helpless on Soraka, Leona and many other traditional supports to save my ADC from the 4 man ganks coming bot lane all the time, thank heavens for the teleport nerf or it would be 5 man. I can only do so much pre-six with a single target stun, my E and exhaust on Leona. I feel helpless to do that which is literally my job.\n> \n\nAs I discussed a little bit with Rubick in another thread, Riot needs to give a support update like they did with the mage and assasin update or the future tank one. Because their ''reworks'' for the supports are all a big failure except for Taric. Sona is still a lane bully and not an aura mage, Leona is only a very rare niche pick, Soraka and Janna are annoying to play against, Blizcrank is too dependant of only one ability and he was designed to be a top laner. Lulu needs a buff too. Most of them need a Kata level of rework while Blitzcrank needs a Poppy level of rework.\n\n> Overall I am really saddened and disheartened trying to play bot lane right now. Between Jhin(and Varus) in every single game, mage supports, snowball, jungler power, lack of wards, extremely slow scaling and lack of agency. The lane is just miserable, unless you are a meta sheep or somebody who happened to main Jhin, Varus, MF or a mage support prior to this period, you are assured to have a lot of frustrating games.\n> \n> I really hope Riot looks at bot lane in the near future, between the problems with jungle, top lane still being an island of ~~hard counter wins~~ minimal value and the state of bot lane at this time, I might just return to being a mid laner. It seems to be the only safe place to play the game, as a mid mage with sufficient range to stay safe.\n> \n> This isn&amp;#039;t to say I don&amp;#039;t think Riot is trying, or that I feel the situation is hopeless. It is merely outlining some of my complaints about playing bot lane, and why I don&amp;#039;t enjoy it anymore.\n> \n> I just want to see more traditional ADCs and supports again.\n\nThey won't, because they think they can keep giving up  the short end of the stick but at one point, people are going to be tired of being autofill in bot lane and people will start to troll in ranked and then Riot will realize that they have an issue.","replies":[{"poster":"GuesstheName132","date":"2017-03-01T20:51:08.056+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=TheFrench Yordle,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=zYNsrZxm,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2017-03-01T17:10:24.345+0000)\n> The thing is, sightstone needs a buff: cheaper or another upgrate or actual good stats or _**recharge itself without the need of backing**_ AND more range.\n\n\n\nThis. Right here.  The fact that supports need to back every two minutes because they used all their wards as soon as they got to lane is quite annoying.  I've always thought it should recharge like the Yellow trinket (which I normally keep until after laning because of this), that way it will be useful for the support and not a time waster.  If they did add this buff, and a stat buff, you may actually see top laners/junglers buy it.  I would love to see that because then more vision will be available, since people can only place three wards at a time (or infinite, easy to remove, blue wards).  The support role overall needs a buff/rework. Not mage supports, but tank and traditional supports.  I want to be able to play Janna, Braum, Taric, and that lot and not be outpushed and out damage by a Malz, Zyra, and even Karma.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"The Yetii Rider","date":"2017-03-02T05:36:37.369+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"You can't balance mages around scaling over base damage.
