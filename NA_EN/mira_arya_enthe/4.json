(Interview/Survey)","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":43,"down_votes":1,"body":"After a comment on a recent post I was watching. I began to realize, I really like this community. Even the people who hate me, and disagree with every post I make. I still like you. Because it&#039;s like a family, and there are the people you deal with because you love them, and those you deal with because you must. As such, I want to get to know everyone a little better with this brief interview/survey about your gameplay. Just a couple questions, I will answer them myself as well :)\n\nQ: Who do you main, and why?\n\nA: Shyvana. I love her as a character, but also in gameplay. I&#039;ve never been the fastest with my fingers nor the most talented at combos. But I am pretty strategic. I love focusing on meta-play, objectives and macroplay in games. Shyvana is perfect for this, she is a stat stick with a lot of strategic potential, where her key aspects are map awareness and decision making rather than twitch and skill. On top of this, I just absolutely adore her, she is a half dragon, and can turn into a dragon. She is a tough brutal girl, and honestly she makes me a bit bi.\n\nQ: Do you prefer one trick or diversity?\n\nA: One trick. I use to be incredibly diverse. In S2-S5 I played multiple roles, all of them in fact. I had a primary champion for each and two backups for each. For a while I called myself a &#039;Teemo main&#039; but it was more just, I played him the most often. He is cute and fuzzy and again... strategic. But after a while I realized jungle was my favorite role. I&#039;d rather be wandering the map, getting objectives, helping everyone, engaging in counter jungling. Than last hitting, trading and waiting for ganks. Jungling is both easier and harder. I always played Shyvana as a top laner and one of my junglers, slowly she became my primary champion.\n\nQ: Do you play ranked? When did you start? What did you achieve each season? What are your goals?\n\nA: I played exclusively normals(and later ARAM) from early S2 through S5 postseason. I only started ranked two months ago. I like the new champion selection system, honestly that was the only reason I never played ranked. I hated the old system for it, so I played blind and later team builder. In two months I have climbed from B4 to S3 and am still climbing, despite not much time to actually play. My goal is gold before the season closes, but may not make it. Honestly I commit more time to studying the game and talking on the forums than playing, which is my main fault in climbing. But I will try my best. Next season the goal is Platinum 5 minimum. And good luck to all of you in your climbing as well!\n\nQ: When did you start playing League, and who was your first champion?\n\nA: Season 2. My first champion played was Xerath, he was on free week. I played him all week until I bought Leona. I was dumb at the time and thought along silly terms. So I was like &quot;Leona is a warrior, she needs a sword, shield, armor, gloves, boots and a locket.&quot; So my build was Infinity Edge, Runic Bulwark, Thormail, Iceborn Gauntlet, Berserker Greaves and Banshee&#039;s Veil. And went mid... It took me about 3 games before I started to figure things out. My second purchased champion was Kassadin, but after a single game I refunded him for Lux so I could use her as an alternate support now that I knew Leona was a support.\n\nQ: What are your favorite things about League?\n\nA: Living out character fantasies through the gameplay. This is why absolute balance and rank take a back seat for me. The fun of League is BEING Shyvana, it is BEING Teemo, it is exploring what you can do, not as that champion, but as that character.\n\nQ: Have you made friends through playing League?\n\nA: Several in fact, some of my closest friends were met through the game. I have even met a few in real life.\n\nQ: What does your summoner name mean and why did you pick it?\n\nA: It is magical, it has no meaning tho ;D\n\nQ: Lastly, do you think you will still be playing in five years?\n\nA: Absolutely, as long as Riot keeps up the quality and keeps innovating, I will always give them the opportunity to provide a fun game. I love this game quite a bit, for me it is the new Star Craft, the new WoW, the new Grand Chase or the new Sonic The Hedgehog. All games I&#039;ve loved throughout my youth. I will keep playing it as long as it remains fun, and at the moment, I am still having plenty.\n\nNow it is your turn, answer these few questions about yourself, and share your gameplay experience with the community.","replies":[{"poster":"RocketRelm","date":"2016-10-14T16:50:43.456+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"Template post for anybody who wants to CP the questions into their own post to answer, but doesn't want to go through the effort going back and forth sorting it out.\n\nQ: Who do you main, and why?\n\nQ: Do you prefer one trick or diversity?\n\nQ: Do you play ranked?

His passive is nice, he has good initiation, ranged poke/slow, and lifesteal works really well on him. I like playing champs who are good at pushing, and enjoy being able to dive into teamfights and kill carries. \n\nQ: Do you prefer one trick or diversity?\n\nA: I don’t one-trick, but I’m not very diverse. I can play top, jg, and support, but I’m a terrible mid or adc. With the roles I can play I have several options to pick from, but I’m always looking forward to getting new champs, and trying new things. \n\nQ: Do you play ranked? When did you start? What did you achieve each season? What are your goals?\n\nA: Yes, then I sit in a corner and cry. I only started playing ranked this year, and quite liked it. I’m currently Silver V, but I’m aiming for Gold, eventually.\n\nQ: When did you start playing League, and who was your first champion?\n\nA: I started playing League around the Preseason to Season 5. I picked up Aatrox first, simply because I thought he looked cool. At that time, I didn’t realize there was an attack speed cap, so I just built as many damage and attack speed items as I could. \n\nQ: What are your favorite things about League?\n\nA: The personality of the champions. Also, game mechanic wise, the laning phase.\n\nQ: Have you made friends through playing League?\n\nA: Sure, I’m currently in college, and League is something that’s enabled me to meet new people and make some friends. \n\nQ: What does your summoner name mean and why did you pick it?\n\nA: “Life’s a laugh, and Death’s a joke it’s true” When I was younger, my Dad showed me a Monty Python movie featuring that quote. Hence the name, Happy Reaper. I added the The because I'm pretentious :)\n\nQ: Lastly, do you think you will still be playing in five years?\n\nA: Yes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Arcus Diabolus","date":"2016-10-15T01:33:36.206+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Mira Arya Enthe,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=eucPGlAp,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-10-14T00:50:11.023+0000)\n>\n> Q: Who do you main, and why?\n\nA: I primarily main Riven. This is mostly because I come from a fighting game background and Riven just so happens to be the closest thing to home as I can get. Her offensive pressure combo oriented play style just kinda clicks. I would argue that I never would have even started playing league if it were not for Riven, in fact. She also has the same VO as my fighting game main, Noel Vermillion, so that also kinda drew me in to Riven in particular. \n\n> Q: Do you prefer one trick or diversity?\n\n A: If I can at all help it, one trick. I pretty much only play this game to play Riven, and only to relax after burning a few hours in training mode on some fighting game. However, I will play whoever I happen to feel like or need to play, as I have a bunch of go-to Subs if picking Riven isn't an option.\n\n> Q: Do you play ranked? When did you start? What did you achieve each season? What are your goals?\n \n A: Hell no. This game has waaaay too many flaws for me to even look at it competitively, the foremost being the emphasis on stats over skill. How people can claim this game is about skill when terms like \"freelo\" or \"FOTM\" exist is beyond me.  Nah, its a casual's life for me. If I can't win without someone even thinking about blaming the champ I'm playing, this game cannot be considered to be about skill more than about stats. IMO, it should never matter if my opponent can two shot me and I have to hit him 100 times, if I'm skilled enough, I should be able to block, dodge or counter anything he throws at me and win, and vice versa. Sure, its harder to win that way, but it should ALWAYS be POSSIBLE, but it isn't and thats shitty. \n\n> Q: When did you start playing League, and who was your first champion?\n\nA: The very end of Season 2. My first champ, as in the first one that I bought and consistently played, was Riven. Sadly, I didn't understand how the Championship skins worked and missed CS Riven when it came out, so that said, I'm VERY happy CS Riven got re-released. \n\n> Q: What are your favorite things about League?\n \n A: Probably winning hard matchups. I actually prefer fighting against someone who gives me a run for my money rather than just flat out sweeping the lane, although I very much will if my opponent gives me the opportunity. I'm walking into lane every time with a full expectation and desire that my opponent has learned to counter me, so I can find a way to counter his counter. (This is how anyone who plays fighting games thinks, btw.)\n\n> Q: Have you made friends through playing League?\n\n A: None that I wouldn't have met IRL playing MTG or something. I played fighting games with them a lot, perhaps more than I do playing league. I sould reconnect with those nerds. Its been a while...\n\n> Q: What does your summoner name mean and why did you pick it?\n\n A: My main in Blazblue is Noel Vermilion. Noel's weapons are two powerful, magical guns called Arcus Diabolus: Bolverk. Since the full name is too long and Bolverk was taken, I went with Arcus Diabolus and it stuck. It then became my global tag. You can find me on PSN, Xbox, Dustloop and other places under this name. (Arcus Diabolus is Latin for roughly \"Bow of the Devil\" but BB uses it in the context \"Demon Guns\". The more you know)\n\n> Q: Lastly, do you think you will still be playing in five years?\n\n A: Ehhhhhhh, not likely. Its certainly possible, but nothing is holding me here besides Riven. If Riven gets a rework and her playstyle stops being similar to what it is, that being that of a fighting game stuck into a moba, OR Riven simply gets nerfed into the ground, then I really don't think I'd continue unless they release someone better. \n\nHope this was what you were looking for! I'd be happy to answer any other questions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ruin Lance","date":"2016-10-14T18:47:53.565+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Q: Who do you main, and why?\n\nA: For me it's {{champion:157}}. \n Back in mid-season 5 my friends kept complaining about how he was overpowered and annoying and I got sick of hearing it every game there was a Yasuo on the enemy team. So, I tried picking him up but did miserably bad for 4 games in a row. I had decided that he wasn't the champion for me and moved on to play {{champion:90}}, {{champion:103}}, and {{champion:102}}. \n\n Eventually after trying ranked I just couldn't win nearly as much as I could in normals and got really frustrated. So I asked my friend who introduced me to League, \"who is a fun champion that can carry?\" and he told me Yasuo instantly. I told him that I wasn't very good with him so he told me to try playing him again but read a guide or something. I went to look for a guide and found one on lolking, but I didn't read much into it. All I saw was the maxing order, and that the guide's author maxed E first (though I'm not sure that's the reason I randomly started doing good.) So I started a game as Yasuo and did okay, I won my lane and the enemy surrendered at 20. I went on to play Yasuo in ranked, with only a month of ranked remaining. I hit Gold V on the day that pre-season started.  \n\nQ: Do you prefer one trick or diversity?\n\nA: One trick. I like to be known for certain things, so that people think of something specific when they think of me. But also because \n\nQ: Do you play ranked? When did you start? What did you achieve each season? What are your goals?\n\nA: Yes. I'll continue where I left off on my first answer.\n\nA little later, into season 6, I tried ranked again and got placed in silver 5. I made it to silver 4 pretty fast playing Yasuo, but stopped because I couldn't get mid lane enough and this was when Yasuo top was not meta. I played normals for a while until after a game playing with a 5 man premade, while I was playing Yasuo ADC/bot lane, one of them asked asked me, \"why are you only silver?\" I thought I was just slightly above average for a silver player at the time, despite most of my games I would usually stomp my lane and carry the game. But that's when I seriously considered ranked. If I could do the same as I did in normals in ranked, then I felt that I'd have no problem getting to Gold. I played a few games but only got mid once (my secondary role was ADC, which I seemed to get a lot.) I had a thought, suddenly. I had a lot of success with playing Yasuo ADC in normals and rarely would I ever lose lane, and since I got stuck with ADC so much I decided to try it in ranked. I found out quickly that hovering Yasuo ADC will get Yasuo banned VERY quickly by my team. So I would always just not hover it, and lock in when it came around to be my turn to pick. I had a few trolls along the way, but most people would just go, \"yasuo adc???\" and only complain afterwards if I did bad, which usually I didn't, or if we ended up losing. I was really surprised, though. I managed to climb from Silver 4 to Gold 5 in the matter of a week or so. I met a lot of people that came to be my friends along the way, too. I got Gold 4 the next day. In one of my games, however, I met someone that was pretty impressed with my pick, and asked to duo and that they would support. Usually they picked Janna, but also Nautilus and Alistar if we were in need of a tank or if Janna was picked/banned. I usually ended up dodging if Yasuo was banned, but since this was earlier into Season 6 it didn't happen nearly as much. I got out of Gold 4 pretty quickly duoing with this guy, who also played Kayle if he was assigned a role besides support. \n\n I went from Gold 4 to Gold 2 in about a week. I actually skipped over Gold 3 completely due to my MMR being so high. I had around a 70% winrate and hadn't failed a single promotional series or gotten demoted yet, it's probably worth noting. I hit Gold 1 in about a day and every time I played ranked at this point, I had a really nervous feeling in my stomach, and I'm sure most people can relate to that feeling. \n\n Once I got to my promos, my duo partner suddenly disappeared. He hasn't been online since. I decided to duo with someone else on my friend list who also mained support, and was Plat V. I quickly got to 2-2 in my promos, and I was a nervous wreck. I was assigned top lane, since for some reason I decided to queue for top lane as my secondary role instead of mid lane. I hovered Yasuo and the mid laner on my team took him from me. As much as I wanted to dodge, I couldn't or I would lose my series. I panic picked Kennen since he was one of the only other champions I had played recently. This game would be the first one that I play him AP, and I'm honestly really glad that my teammate took Yasuo from me that game, since Kennen is now one of my mid/top picks when my team is in need of AP. I dumpstered my lane HARD and I was blown away by Kennen's damage output. I underestimated this champion for so long, but my view on him changed after this game. Our team won extremely hard. I was able to pull off so many good ultimates that game and I'd like to think that's what won us the game. Our Yasuo ended up doing decent, although his build was beyond stupid. He had a {{item:3087}} {{item:3046}} {{item:3031}} all built at the same time. I got Platinum 5 that game and I was so happy. \n\n A lot of my friends congratulated me and I thought I would stop playing ranked then, but I went on to test my luck and see if I could climb further in Platinum, which I did. I played a few duo games with the same support main that got me through my promos, but he also disappeared after a few games. Both support mains haven't been online at all since the last time I played with them. Pretty weird. But that's kind of besides the point. I got Platinum 4 pretty quickly, and then got into Platinum 2 a few days after, completely skipping over Platinum 3. I had climbed from Gold 5 to Plat 2 in the matter of 3-4 weeks playing almost exclusively Yasuo ADC (If you don't believe me, I have a screenshot of my op.gg's tier graph: [http://i.imgur.com/FU5qbhW.png](http://i.imgur.com/FU5qbhW.png). A lot of my friends said things like, \"weren't you silver just like a week ago?\" My rank plateaued (plat-two'd :^)) at Platinum 2 for a while. I lost a lot of the success that I had with Yasuo ADC that I did previously. I went on to also learn Vladimir, and start playing mid and top lane instead of ADC. I was doing better than I was before, but I still couldn't climb from Platinum 2.\n\n Eventually I finally got to my promos, but failed. I tried again next month and finally got into Platinum 1, only to be demoted a day later. After months, I finally got into Platinum 1 and stayed there. I got to my Diamond 5 promos recently, but failed 1-3. I plan to get there by the end of this season, but instead of playing Yasuo, since he's nearly permabanned, and Vladimir, since he's trash-tier on solo queue, I'm going to play {{champion:104}}, {{champion:24}}, {{champion:85}}, {{champion:39}}, and {{champion:420}}. Wow that was a long write. \n\nQ: When did you start playing League, and who was your first champion?\n\nA: I first played like 2 games in season 4 and I hated the game. It didn't make sense at all to me. My first champion that I played was Taric, and I had one of the strangest builds. It was something like Trinity Force, Deathfire grasp, Warmog's, and I don't remember what else. I thought that ability power meant literally that it would determine your ability damage, even if you were someone like Talon. I thought attack damage meant literally that it would determine the damage of your basic attacks and nothing else. My friend got me into League again right after Bard's release. I played Riven, Jax, Pantheon, and Heimerdinger.\n\nQ: What are your favorite things about League?\n\nA: Seeing my rank improve and playing with friends.\n\nQ: Have you made friends through playing League?\n\nA: Yeah, my best friends I met in League.\n\nQ: What does your summoner name mean and why did you pick it?\n\nA: I used to have a clan on Xbox live called Ruin, and my name before that was LancexGunner, a name that I came up with when I was 9 lol. I renamed myself to Ruin Lance on Xbox live, and it's been my name on everything ever since.\n\nQ: Lastly, do you think you will still be playing in five years?\n\nA: I might not quit, but I'll probably play a lot less. I don't get very much enjoyment from destroying every normal game with Yasuo, and I'm not the best with a lot of other champions so I do get frustrated that I'm unable to carry sometimes. I'm also not confident enough to play ranked as much. Plus I'm going into college in a few years so I'm sure that will also stop me from playing.\n\nMan I really should save this post because that was like an essay's worth of writing.","replies":[{"poster":"Mira Arya Enthe","date":"2016-10-14T19:07:26.858+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I read it all :3 and thanks for sharing.

Originally, I mostly mained her because she was, like me, a lady who liked spiders. However, I soon feel in love with her kit, her early ganking possibilities, her build paths, her little spiderlings, and her healthy clears. When I play Elise I feel in control of the game a lot of the time, and I find it's very easy to adapt. I can be a damage carry if I have to be, especially in the earlygame. I can build tanky easily and be a tanky brawler, or I can build more damage and be an assassin, depending on what the game calls for. Her buildpath is incredibly diverse.\n\nQ: Do you prefer one trick or diversity?\n\nA: I really enjoy people who enjoy their mains. I don't necessarily think everyone has to onetrick, but I loooove meeting people who are mains and clearly love a specific champion, and I love hearing how they came to main those champions. If not enjoying pure onetrick, I certainly enjoy pocket picks.\n\nQ: Do you play ranked? When did you start? What did you achieve each season? What are your goals?\n\nA: I play ranked. Technically I started at the end of season 5, but I had no idea what I was doing, got placed in bronze 2 and tanked myself down to bronze 4. This season, I've played it on and off, and currently sit at Silver 3 with a 54% winrate on Elise (it was higher but I learned the hard way to never ever ever play when tilted.) over about 102 games overall on her this season.\n\nQ: When did you start playing League, and who was your first champion?\n\nA: Season 1-ish? Just as a casual thing. I mean, I didn't hit 30 until last year, haha. I think the first champions I remember myself playing a lot of and liking were Warwick (I think mostly because he was the only champ I could clear jungle with, pre runes and masteries), Cho'gath (because he looked like a big alien t-rex.), and Cassiopeia (because, like me, she was a lady that enjoyed snakes).\n\nQ: What are your favorite things about League?\n\nA: The diverse gameplay experiences that can be brought on purely from which characters are in a game. I think it's pretty awesome how teamcomps and such play out. I also uhh... I like oneshotting people on Elise. Human Q + W + Protobelt. I call it \"The shotgun\"\n\nQ: Have you made friends through playing League?\n\nA: Quite a few! I even have a few discord servers for a lot of them :D\n\nQ: What does your summoner name mean and why did you pick it?\n\nA: My summoner name is literally just after Lolth, the Spider Goddess in DnD. I barely even play DnD, but I really love Lolth's lore and I wanted something that represented me being a Spider Queen. \n\nQ: Lastly, do you think you will still be playing in five years?\nI sure hope so!","replies":[{"poster":"Mira Arya Enthe","date":"2016-10-14T16:42:19.793+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have a secret(not anymore) crush on Elise.

There aren't really a lack of female junglers (Nidalee, Rek'sai, Elise in pro-play, but also things like Sejuani, Vi, Evelynn, Kindred) so I kinda wonder why all of us like Shyvana so much.

But I love questionnaires, so I will post on this thread.\n\n**Q: Who do you main, and why?**\n\nLulu support exclusively. Originally I wanted to main midlane or ADC because I used to play ranged carries in almost every other game, ever, but those were and have been in high demand back in the days of season 3. Not a chance for me. At that very same time, my internet have been jack *shit*, to the point where trying to learn to last hit is extremely difficult. No, I can't even call my role because of how slow my client used to be, so I'm pretty much left with support. Since that time I'm still a noob at the game, might as well take support, and learn things from behind as a backline support. Sona was my first support, and she did serve her job well as \"baby's first support\".\n\nHowever, I never liked playing as *the* healer. I asked a friend about who else to try out, and Lulu came to mind. I picked her up instantly, and quickly learned the dark ways of supporting arts. Of course, I used to be *really* bad at playing her and not knowing how to manage buffs and debuffs like almost every bad Lulu support player ever, but over the years I theorycrafted my own ways to play, and climbed my way through, even if Lulu support was \"outclassed\", \"overnerfed\", and \"a shittier version of solo lane\". Had to do them on my own because of how unreliable and ineffective guides and even some people's advice are. Though right now it actually feels like an accomplishment; make your own build and achieve success with it.\n\nOther champs, by then, now look boring. I gave up trying to learn other roles because you can say you want support, and get it 98% of the time, no contest. I do believe I'm pretty good at supporting and that it is obviously something many people can't and refuse to do. I mean, why waste more effort learning something you will not get to do (and that you will probably suck at it), when you can improve on whatever you are already quite good at, and that you can get to do so almost guaranteed?\n\n**Q: Do you prefer one trick or diversity?**\n\nOne trick. Easier to improve and specialization often has more effective results. Almost everyone else bores me, unfortunately, but then that's just me.\n\n**Q: Do you play ranked? When did you start? What did you achieve each season? What are your goals?**\n\nI play ranked most of the time because I'm pretty much a one-trick. I can make a use of my \"skills\" by playing ranked, instead of wasting such \"skills\" in normals which will not really leave much record.\n\nStarted ranked in season 3. That time, I bullcrapped my way through placements and got a silver 3. As a noob who have been garbage in a lot of video games, silver 3 is an accomplishment to me. In season 4 I started taking ranked more seriously. Got placed in bronze 2, ended the season with gold 5. Season 5, placed in silver 4, climbed all the way to gold 1 100 LP, mega-tilted back to gold 5 0 LP, then finally back to gold 2 on the very last day. MOST of such games by exclusively Lulu support.\n\nThis season I'm hoping to get plat so my dedication as a Lulu support main... is actually worth something. I'm kinda tired of people consistently telling me Lulu support \"sucks\", even by higher elo players because they actually don't know how Lulu works as support. Yeah, I guess plat isn't *that* impressive because hehe xd dynamicq, but it's still something. Even if I duo almost all the time now. It's still something to me.\n\n**Q: When did you start playing League, and who was your first champion?**\n\nPreseason 3. If anyone remembers the tutorial where Ashe was the *first* thing people play, then there's that.\n\n**Q: What are your favorite things about League?**\n\nYou don't have to have the quickest reflexes just to do well. You don't even have to kill and still do something, which isn't too common in gaming in general. Best of all, you get to win because you know how to quickly use your brains, not just scripting yourself and expect results. Of course, League actually has *plenty* of room for mistakes, and you can make it up if you are smart enough.\n\n**Q: Have you made friends through playing League?**\n\nI have met a few buddies IRL, dated, and broke up with players. Though in the end, I just duo with my IRL friend that I've known long before I started playing this game.\n\n**Q: What does your summoner name mean and why did you pick it?**\n\nMy very first IGN was uh..... based on a meme back in 2008, rage comics and shit. Was basically that female protagonist. We all know what happens when people have \"girly\" names, they get *lots* of shit. Changed that a year later, to something Dunkey related because that sounded cool. Though I had absolutely no idea on who the hell Dunkey was. Bad idea.\n\nAfter knowing this one friend, I decided to change to Sadistic Lulu, in hopes of trolling him because he one-tricks something else. Another year later, he made a smurf called Cancerous Lulu, and I thought to myself, \"hey, that's actually a good idea!\"\n\nI really wanted Wicked Lulu but unfortunately, that's taken by some ARAM account. Phooey. But honestly, I like my current IGN because it's quite fitting to what I main, and how I act sometimes in games. Nah, being toxic is too much work, but creating a really weird sense of humor with my duo is already uh... I guess, *cancerous* enough.\n\n**Q: Lastly, do you think you will still be playing in five years?**\n\nDepends on what happens in my post-college life. Or something like that.\n\nAs long as I can play Lulu support, I will continue to play this game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"NineTailedMystic","date":"2016-10-14T08:23:30.695+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Q: Who do you main, and why?\n\nA: Ahri. Ki-tsu-ne. I adore fox girls, kitsune, and nine-tailed foxes. I'd play her no matter her kit or strength, but she has a fun kit that isn't braindead, but still simple and isn't terrible to face either.\n\nQ: Do you prefer one trick or diversity?\n\nA: One trick. If Ahri were to be disabled/removed/never existed I probably wouldn't play the game.\n\nQ: Do you play ranked? When did you start? What did you achieve each season? What are your goals?\n\nA: I started in preseason 5, late December 2014. Didn't touch Ranked until a month before S5 ended, then spammed promo games place Silver 3, got up to like 60 LP. Then they announced Victorious Sivir then I stopped playing Ranked because I no longer cared. Come S6 I took promo games in like July and got placed S2 and climbed to S1 70 LP. Stopped playing for a while, and recently got on a bad losing streak and back to S2. I want the Gold border, but ew Victorious Maokai. To be frank, I hate Ranked. I feel inadequate when I do poorly in such a low ELO despite being a one trick, yet I feel I'm inadequate in Normals because it's not Ranked. I get more stressed in Ranked and feel more inclined to fault my teammates, but I feel like I take Normals too serious. My end goal is Platinum.\n\nQ: When did you start playing League, and who was your first champion?\n\nA: Early Preseason 5. Nami support. She was free week, and my friends taught me how to play while I saved IP for Ahri.\n\nQ: What are your favorite things about League?\n\nA: Ahri. Playing with friends. Playing a game of moderate skill.\n\nQ: Have you made friends through playing League?\n\nA: Yea, a few Internet friends.\n\nQ: What does your summoner name mean and why did you pick it?\n\nA: In Pathfinder, there's a Sorcerer class archetype for the Kitsune race called the \"Nine-Tailed Mystic\", that allows the character to trade Bloodline spells for Magical Tail feats, giving your character more tails and some alternate magical abilities. I figured it'd be a good name for an Ahri one trick. RIP 16 Character limit so no spaces.\n\nQ: Lastly, do you think you will still be playing in five years?\n\nA: As long as Ahri stays, and they don't make changes to the game that I find so revolting they make me leave the game, sure.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Akali is SO HOT","date":"2016-10-14T01:21:16.918+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"**Q: Who do you main, and why?**\n\nAkali.

Using my shroud to outplay my opponents and dashing around all over the place and then going insane pentakill mode with resets if I can survive long enough.  Making picks on carries that are out of position feels really good.  Akali is sorta like the AP version of Master Yi where she does a ton of single target damage like he does and then if he gets a kill he can go off and pentakill the entire team if he plays it right.  Akali can do the same thing, but it's usually much harder for her to do so because of her low DPS.

When I started the game a friend of mine recommended him to me out of his thematic and character, since I love basically anything and everything vampire. As time went on, I found that his personality and gameplay gelled with mine so well that I couldnt let him go, and have mained him ever since I started.\n\nQ: Do you prefer one trick or diversity?\n\nDiversity. I love Vladimir and would never give him up, but I also love other characters, like Jhin, Gangplank, Sion, Yorick, Kled, Aurelion Sol, Swain, Master Yi, Elise, and many more.\n\nQ: Do you play ranked? When did you start? What did you achieve each season? What are your goals?\n\nI started in my first season (S4) and placed Silver V, staying there due to a lack of interest. In S5 I banded together with some friends and made Gold V in pursuit of the Victorious skin. This season I peaked at Plat III (decayed down due to a few months abroad) and will probably end the season Plat V. I generally don't care for ranked beyond Victorious skin, so whether I place Gold V or Diamond I is irrelevant to me.\n\nQ: When did you start playing League, and who was your first champion?\n\nAgain, Vladimir. Seeing his classic splash in the loading screen - even now - brings an indescribable feeling to me. The feeling of finally being able to play my favourite character whenever I want. Although I distinctly remember Fiddlesticks being the first champ I actually bought, though I may be wrong.\n\nQ: What are your favorite things about League?\n\nThe lore, slowly developing as it is. I also love the thrill of change (though will admit that sometimes change _isnt_ good), and the idea of always competing against myself as much as others. I also love being able to play video games with my friends, and I've made more than a fair few through this game alone.\n\nQ: Have you made friends through playing League?\n\nAs the above stated, yes, I have. Some of them are some of the best friends I've ever made and I would give up the world for them.\n\nQ: What does your summoner name mean and why did you pick it?\n\nOriginally my summoner name was TheUntitledKing, as a reference to my novel. When I wanted to be recognized as a Vladimir main, a friend and I simultaneously changed our names to something that reflected our mains; and thus Tides of Blood was born. Notably, his summoner name is eerily similar.\n\nQ: Lastly, do you think you will still be playing in five years?\n\nIf League lives, so does my account.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SanKakU","date":"2016-10-15T00:53:31.315+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Q: Who do you main, and why?\n\nA: I don't believe in mains. But if I did, I might main Sejuani. She seems like one of the safest champs to play, her kit all around is so good. I think the only weakness she has is her Q can be blocked by the enemy if they're smart enough to protect their allies or to cut off your escape that way.\n\nQ: Do you prefer one trick or diversity?\n\nA: Definitely diversity. I can jungle with practically anyone, and I can play pretty much any role. I am not afraid to play APC or Assassin at bottom lane for example, or to play a Tank in pretty much any team slot. I think finding something OP is great, but sometimes to do that you have to try something outside the box.\n\nQ: Do you play ranked? When did you start? What did you achieve each season? What are your goals?\n\nA: Not really. Have given it a try sometimes, but I just get massive losing streaks for no good reason. Lots of toxicity from the other players, they don't want to win. I didn't take LoL seriously at all when I first started playing it. Played off and on for years. Eventually a few years before now I played and got Silver 3 while losing like 3-7(don't really remember) of my first ten games. Then I dropped down to Silver 5 pretty quickly because of massive amounts of game ruining from teammates and couldn't even get close to Silver 4 and gave up on ranked ever since. Game ruining teammates completely destroy the ranked experience for me. Even if it's just a couple of games in a row, it's extremely unpleasant. I just want to be able to play the damn thing without people constantly going AFK, disconnecting, feeding intentionally, doing everything they can to make sure their team loses, and constantly flooding the chat.\n\nQ: When did you start playing League, and who was your first champion?\n\nA: In the beginning. I just played like I don't know, 1 or 3 or 4 games or something? Once for each of the maps. Then I got Rammus for free, and Kayle shortly afterwards.\n\nQ: What are your favorite things about League?\n\nI suppose one thing I like about it is that a lot of the champions feel very complete. I don't feel like they're missing a ton of stuff that would make them really good. Now there are of course, exceptions...like Galio for example...but these champions have reworks planned or at least are soon to be planned anyways.\n\nQ: Have you made friends through playing League?\n\nA: Not really. Sure, I have a friend list, but I hardly ever bother to access it. I habitually realize that I forgot to add players that I played with yesterday.\n\nQ: Lastly, do you think you will still be playing in five years?\n\nA: I suppose so. I like the direction they're taking the game. They seem to be taking the development a lot more seriously than Blizzard or Valve with their games. I don't know if I'll really feel like it's as amazing as it could be, time will tell. Some people, I just don't get why they get so excited over the game. The biggest feeling I get from these games is frustration. That feeling of powerlessness when you know you're going to lose and there's nothing you can do about it. It sucks. And it's why I quit these games again and again, when I feel it way too often.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Keepe","date":"2016-10-14T20:06:00.831+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Q: Who do you main, and why?\n\nOnce upon a time, from season two to this season, I would have answered immediately. “Swain.” But with the Mage Update… I don’t feel the love I once felt for him.

They also hold very long grudges… Can’t even begin to tell you how many trees get angry at someone only to drop a limb on them a mere fifty years later!” He just seems… so happy.\n\n\nQ: Do you prefer one trick or diversity?\n\nI diversify. There was once not even a question of whether or not you were a one trick.

For top lane, I used to try to be a nice guy who played tanks to fit my team's needs, but either due to my team being brain-dead monkeys or due to me just not being good at playing tanks I realized I needed to play carry top laners. My first carry top laner's were Tryndamere and Garen, and later Darius, who I still do play in normals, but I realized how team-reliant all of them were. Tryndamere and Garen can't team fight, and while Darius can he's reliant on his team supporting him to enable him to get off his damage. Tryndamere also had a big problem of being too narrow in focus. He could splitpush and duel, but that was all. He couldn't team fight. So I needed top laners who could feasibly duel, win lane, splitpush, and be big presences in team fights. Versatile carry top laners. I saw Wukong was consistently doing well, and tried him out, and loved him. I tried Yasuo out in normals (as a mid laner at first), and eventually got good enough to play him in ranked (a relatively recent development), and he is bar none one of the most fun champions in the game. \n\nAs for Yi, I've always loved Yi. Sion taught me how to jungle, but Yi made it my secondary role. There's nothing more fun than running up on bot lane and breaking the sound barrier, before Q'ing the Morgana Q and killing her carry. \n\nIn general, I prefer champions who can get fed early but still scale well, which these champions are.\n\nI also want to practice Fiora and make her one of my main top laners, both because she is super fun and also mai waifu, one of my favorite characters in League.\n\nQ: Do you prefer one trick or diversity?\n\nDiversity. Despite me having mains, I can play most top laners and junglers fairly well. In the jungle if Yi is banned or if it would otherwise be a bad idea to play him I usually default to Volibear or occasionally Jax. Top lane if we are otherwise all AD I go Dr. Mundo, and I will also play Garen, Mordekaiser, Graves, and Fiora in ranked.\n\nIn normals I will play just about anything, my champion pool is considerably more vast.\n\nQ: Do you play ranked? When did you start? What did you achieve each season? What are your goals?\n\nI do play ranked, I have a little over 100 games this season.

I love everything about him, from his background to his playstyle. I find his Q very interesting and satisfying to utilize well, especially in side lanes (which is one reason I play him both mid and support). I tend to prefer a tankier build rather than burst mage in most games but love playing him either way. It also helps that he's a void creature and I cannot get enough of them (original main was Kog'Maw, who was my first love from the time I joined the league--RIP Madreds/Serkers/Wits/Malady/FoN/Randuin Kog, my favorite build back then). I own every skin for void creatures except for Death Blossom Kha and Pool Party Rek. Just waiting for sales on those.

Also I love the skins for all the champions too :D.\n\nQ: Have you made friends through league?\n\nA: Yeah some but most end up not talking to me after a while. I have some irl friends I play with but they aren't on late at night when I play but I'm on during the day when they play so that's good. The ranked 5s team we're doing is fun rn though so that's good. I feel really special because I'm platinum and they're all bronze and silver and having the highest kills participation and damage is nice and it feels really rewarding :D. Just need to set up proper times for us all to be on.\n\nQ: What does your summoner name mean and why did you pick it?\n\nA: My old summoner name that I had was First Time Sona which I thought was clever since I played Sona like every game. I picked Queen Of Plants because when I play Zyra I feel like the Queen Of Plants :D. Thought it was appropriate.\n\nQ: Lasty, do you think you'll be playing in 5 years?\n\nA: Definitely, I love this game so much, even if Riot does some questionable things, This game has brought me thousands of hours of enjoyment and thousands more to come  :D. My life is at a turning point though but I really hope I can keep playing, not as much of course but still play a lot. I'll have to see though. I definitely won't stop all together though","replies":[]},{"poster":"SteveKareha","date":"2016-10-14T18:50:09.667+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Q: Who do you main, and why?\n\nA: I currently main Sona. I used to play the old Karma a lot before she was reworked back in season 2, she had an amazing baiting potential, and as she was underplayed back then, many people didn't know how to deal with her, I started maining Sona when I stopped playing Karma when she got reworked, and found her incredibly easy to use and steamroll with her, I tend to do so good with her I even got gifted her DJ Skin. \n\nQ: Do you prefer one trick or diversity?\n\nA: I like to be like a Mixture of both, like focusing at least on one champion per role so I don't really get stomped when someone bans my pick or someone steals my role in champ select.\n\nQ: Do you play ranked? When did you start? What did you achieve each season? What are your goals?\n\nA: Recently I don't have time or a good internet to focus on rankeds, but I feel like I have improved a lot, and when I eventually can play ranked again I'm sure I'll be at least gold haha. As of past seasons I didnt achieve much, I was bronze on Season 3 and stayed as Silver in seasons 4 and 5, currently I'm unranked, My goals are not ambitious like become a pro or something, I just wanna get to gold :P\n\nQ: When did you start playing League, and who was your first champion?\n\nA: I started playing back when Hecarim was realeased, Season 2 I think. I started playing because at the time I was a Brony and Hecarim having references to the series made me interested, I started playing and had fun, my very first champion was Master Yi, as i found him incredibly easy to play in lower levels, then moved on from champion to champion, eventually setting on Karma and the Sona.\n\nQ: What are your favorite things about League?\n\nA: Lore! And the art and music is also amazing, I also love the fact that the game is always changing, it never gets stale.\n\nQ: Have you made friends through playing League?\n\nA: Not really, but I have gotten some of my friends to play it and they liked it. I gotten some family to play it too, even my mom played with me once!\n\nQ: What does your summoner name mean and why did you pick it?\n\nA: It's from a character from the game Yume Nikki, on the year I played on the LATAM server, I used to go by John Egbert, as I love homestuck and I kinda resemble the character, when I moved back to NA I got SteveKareha again as John Egbert was already occupied\n\nQ: Lastly, do you think you will still be playing in five years?\n\nA: Of course, LoL is one those games that just becomes a staple in your life, something that you look forward to in your day, I just hope Riot keeps innovating and adding to this game.\n\nP.D: @OP Man!

Why i main him? My friends it's actually quite the tale. Late 2013, a young man (me) opens the league of legends client for the first time (damn now I miss the old client) and i see it: Yasuo, the Unforgiven, now available (or something like that), I look at the image, and I see this badass looking samurai, It immediately gets my attention, I click launch, and then I watch, as Yasuo gives his monologue in his cool VO, slightly unsheathes his sword, creates a whirlwind around him, and returns to his sitting position, with his attackers dead behind him. I know I have to play this champion, I do the tutorial (#thornmailAsheftw) and search for him in the store, I click on him, I see his abilities, I read his lore, I found everything related to him basically (champion spotlight, A Sword without a Sheath, A road to ruin) his short story ,I even checked the tips section because I knew I was going to play this champion the most.\n Now almost 3 years later, knowing perfectly that Yasuo is one of the most hated champions in league, that many people, even teammates, hate me for playing this champion, I still main him, and idgaf about your hate.\n\nQ: Do you prefer one-trick or diversity?\n\nA: One-trick, I find playing many champions and learning them to exhausting.\n\nQ: Do you play ranked? When did you start? What did you achieve each season? What are your goals?\n\nA: Yes, I started when I reached lvl30 (a mistake, I know). In season 4 I finished silver II, in season 5 I climbed to gold II, currently I'm on plat IV with 82. My goals are to keep improving my rank, and to test my Yasuo play against the most competitive players.\n\nQ: When did you start playing league, and who was your first champion?\n\nA: Preseason 4 (Late 2013). Yasuo.\n\nQ: What your favourite things about league?\n\nA: Yasuo, Blood Moon Yasuo, Shen, Karthus, URF, Ascension, competitivety\n\nQ: Have you made friends through playing League?\n\nA: Nah, I either play alone or with IRL friends.\n\nQ: What does your summoner name mean and why did you pick it?\n\nA: I wanted to pick something related to League, and at the same time something terrifying, I think a tyrant is very terrifying. :D\n\nQ: Lastly, do you think you will still be playing in five years?\n\nA: Dunno, I will enter university next year, so I will probably have less time to play, but I don't think I will quit.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sahn Uzal","date":"2016-10-14T17:44:58.917+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Q: Who do you main, and why?\n\nA: Gangplank, I'm a toplane main, I love Gangplanks thematic, his voice over (Praise the badass torture quotes), I love his barrel combos, his sound effects, his animations.

However I stopped Naut jungle because he's so team dependent and I stopped playing support so I suppose I \"main\" the champ I have most fun with. The champ in question being the Mad Bastard/Chemist Singed! I love playing him top lane because it's so entertaining watching Tank Ekko, AD/Tank Yas, Riven, and even Darius dye from choking on my poison. The fact that I have to play around Singed's limited options in his kit and his terrible passive makes it more satisfying to succeed in lane.

I love Thresh's play-making ability, and I play support most of the time with friends. A friend of mine and I duo bot a lot because we have really good chemistry and have played together since we both started. Ekko has been a comfort pick since his release. I absolutely loved his kit because I am fond of the assassin play style and skirmishing.\n\nQ: Do you prefer one trick or diversity?\n\nA: I like diversity, although I am trying to force myself to be a little pickier. I always thought that having a really deep champion pool would enable me to get better at the game because I would know everyone's strengths and weaknesses. That way, I can complement my teammates picks and round out our comp, or I can counter the enemy team by knowing how to beat those champions. \n\nQ: Do you play ranked? When did you start? What did you achieve each season? What are your goals?\n\nA: Never really gotten into ranked. I have trouble convincing myself to try. I always believe I can improve my mechanics and my gameplay so I want to get better before being measured competitively. However, I did complete my 10 game placements for season 5. Got Bronze 2 but didn't play after that. I think next season I will be able to focus on ranked more. I would like to reach gold and hopefully keep climbing from there.\n\nQ: When did you start playing League, and who was your first champion?\n\nA: I started playing towards the end of season 4. I can't quite remember my very first champ because I got Malphite and Morgana around the same time. I played both of them as support because one of the people who got me into League was an AD Carry main. So he kinda taught me as we went.\n\nQ: What are your favorite things about League?\n\nA: I love the depth it has to offer. From lore, to gameplay, to the math behind stats, to the artwork, to esports and the fanbase. There is so much creativity and fun involved with League.\n\nQ: Have you made friends through playing League?\n\nA: Yes. A couple friends of mine on campus had convinced me to play League. I was a support main at the time. I had several classes with a buddy on my Quidditch team, and his roommate was an ADC main. So we added each other and duoed bot lane on several occasions before actually meeting in person. I would say that he is my best League pal to this day. We always play together and have a blast doing it. Also have met people in the game from just having friendly conversations and keeping in touch.\n\nQ: What does your summoner name mean and why did you pick it?\n\nA: My name, Quannari, is kinda two fold. It's my accidental take on a blend of two names. Durnehviir (dragon in the Soul Cairn from Skyrim) calls the you (the protagonist) \"Qahnaarin\" meaning \"Vanquisher\". I thought that name sounds pretty cool. That was part one. The other part was from a game my dad and I used to play called \"Gauntlet: Seven Sorrows.\" My dad created a character and named him \"Quantis\", just something he came up with on the spot. Have lots of good memories playing that with my dad. So my name is a mixture of Qahnarrin and Quantis with my own flair. Quannari.\n\nQ: Lastly, do you think you will still be playing in five years?\n\nA: I'm sure I will.

Missed out on UFO Corki, RIP. My first champion was Heimerdinger. I just found him hilarious and pretty fun to play. Moved on to mostly supports like Janna after that. Then a ton of Ashe.\n\nQ: What are your favorite things about League?\n\nA: I like multitasking so keeping tracks of my resources and my opponents, the map, when to trade and how, and so on is fun to me.

You actually really need to consider what's going on with each set of bullets rather than just hammer down the creeps like you would normally. Since he doesn't have a way to add a bullet or build to reload faster like Graves, you constantly have to play around his reload and try to minimize how vulnerable you are during it.\n\nThe biggest skill to learn for Jhin is when you should proceed forward in a fight and auto and when you need to just ult. Sometimes you're better off using your ult at the start of a fight then joining afterwards when you see how it is going.

Kayle has been a champ that I've always gone to as a comfort pick, because I could play her anywhere, but never really decided to \"main\" until the end of last season. Viktor has been one of my go-to's since I first played him (just before he dropped to 4800) and his E is quite simply one of the most fun abilities in the game. Morgana is probably the safest matchup neutral champ in the game, and it's fun to play someone you know you win or lose with based on your own actions.\n\n Q: Do you prefer one trick or diversity?\n \n A: Shallow diversity :p. Have more than one champ, but not too many. Let's you avoid matchups you don't like, and makes sure you're very familiar with your champs. \n\n Q: Do you play ranked? When did you start? What did you achieve each season? What are your goals?\n\n A: Yes. S4. Silver, Bronze last season. Goal is to be able to think the same way I do when I watch a game as when I play a game. I tunnel too hard when I play and have little awareness, so I do things like pushing when the jungle is obviously there, but when I'm freed up when watching replays, I'm quite good at knowing where people are and what they're going to do. Just need to work on my in-game focus, which is currently terrible.\n\n Q: When did you start playing League, and who was your first champion?\n \n A: S3 - Sona. RIP Sona\n \n Q: What are your favorite things about League?\n \n A: It's one of the few games that has both decision based (stat sticks) and action based (outplay) competitive gameplay. The last game that I can remember that managed to balance both was Halo 2.\n \n Q: Have you made friends through playing League?\n \n A: Not really\n \n Q: What does your summoner name mean and why did you pick it?\n \n A: Mortal Kombat reference.\n \n Q: Lastly, do you think you will still be playing in five years?\n \n A: Depends on development.

Sona and Nami were actually among the first champions I played in League. Back in Season 4, when one of my friends got me into the game, I was a Support OTP. At the time, my go-tos were Janna and Leona. One week, Sona was on the F2P rotation and I asked my friend \"She looks interesting. Is she any good?\" He laughed and said \"She is so fucking bad it's not even funny. She's not even fun, all of her abilities are BORING.\" I thought about it and said \"Imma play her. She looks fun.\" And it was a match made in heaven. Outrageous burst damage, obnoxious healing, movespeed, auto-attack modifiers, AND a \"Press R to win\" button. Sona was my dream champion...\n\nThen a month later, Nami went on F2P rotation. I didn't really have any friends at the time (Most of us just parted ways due to waning interests), so I just took her into normals and fell in love again. Nami's fun abilities, utility, and charming personality all sealed her as one of my favorite champions in League.\n\nQ: Do you prefer one trick or diversity?\n\nA: Depends: Normals or Ranked? In Ranked/serious play, I keep myself diverse. My logic is: If you can play everything, nobody can ban you out. I may not be as good as an OTP at any one role, but I'm at least competent. In Normals, I'm an off-meta OTP. I love doing off-meta shit like Ashe Jungle or Sona Mid. Nobody EVER expects it and doesn't know how to play against it. It never ceases to be hilarious to pick something ridiculously off-meta, beat your foes into the dirt, and watch them writhe in agony trying to figure out \"How the hell did we lose to ASHE JUNGLE?\" Answer: You didn't invade her. :)\n\nQ: Do you play ranked? When did you start? What did you achieve each season? What are your goals?\n\nA: I play Ranked occasionally, but after almost strictly bad experiences in previous Seasons, I've never really felt any motivation to climb the ladder. I started Ranked in Season 4 close to the end of it and managed Silver 2, but couldn't advance. Season 5 came, I got to Silver 1, but lost any real motivation to play. Currently, I'm in Placements for S6 and aiming for at least Gold, though I think I could do Plat with enough time.\n\nQ: When did you start playing League, and who was your first champion?\n\nA: Season 4. My first champion was Leona. As a Support OTP at the time, my friend (who had recruited me) told me to get Leona ASAP because she was ridiculous. He was right, but Leona was also boring after a while.\n\nQ: What are your favorite things about League?\n\nA: Hmm...The champions themselves is an easy one. They all have defined personalities, for the most part, and feel like CHARACTERS, not pixels on a screen. The fast-paced and keyboard-mashingly good gameplay is also another one, but that's not really a League-exclusive because most MOBAs are actually like that. This is gonna sound dumb, but the name was also a really good catch for me. \"League of Legends\" is the kind of name that lets you know exactly what you're getting into: Your characters are all legends that formed a league to LEGALLY beat the shit out of each other in.\n\nQ: Have you made friends through playing League?\n\nA: Absolutely. Several. But I've ended up parting ways with almost all of them for various reasons. (They were a prick, we didn't talk, they never played, etc etc)\n\nQ: What does your summoner name mean and why did you pick it?\n\nA: Simple: I have an Eevee obsession and I always pick the female character when playing Pokemon. Plus, my name is Alex (which is also what I name my character), so...Yeah.\n\nQ: Lastly, do you think you will still be playing in five years?\n\nA: 5 years? Hard to say. It entirely depends on the direction LoL goes in. 2 or even 3 years is likely, but I'm not sure about 5. Riot's really shaken up my confidence in them, and not in a good way. Season 5 was...New, especially with the games being much longer than normal. (Easily an average of 10 minutes longer per match) Season 6 wasn't new, it was just the overbuffing of a class that was already a staple on every team. (Marksman) I honestly can't say \"yea\" or \"nay\" as my answer, only \"...maybe?\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"aqours fanboy","date":"2016-10-14T17:21:48.943+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Q: Who do you main, and why?\n\nA: AP {{champion:245}} Mid and Jungle. I am an assassin man and playing Ekko full AP feels the most satisfying when landing kills. Can't wait for him to get some lore love.\n\nQ: Do you prefer one trick or diversity?\n\nA: A bit of both. I am perfectly content one tricking throughout ranked but I'll always know at least 3 champs for my roles so I'm not screwed if I can't play my main.\n\nQ: Do you play ranked? When did you start? What did you achieve each season? What are your goals?\n\nA: I played ranked so much and I started at S5 before getting demoted all the way to B4. I stopped for awhile but I've picked it up again and I hope to reach Silver again before the season end. This is also my first full season of League.\n\nQ: When did you start playing League, and who was your first champion?\n\nA: Season 6. My first champion was {{champion:102}} and I played her basically everywhere I could, I had no IDEA about jungle until I unlocked smite, and from there I started learning about that as well. The first champion I bought was Ekko, obviously.\n\nQ: What are your favorite things about League?\n\nA: Best part for me is how I'm always learning something new about this game. It surprises me every time how I believe I know enough but I actually never scrapped the surface. Also reading up on lore. SO INTERESTING :D\n\nQ: Have you made friends through playing League?\n\nA: Several in fact, I've met quite a few who I'm friends with and play with irl frequently.\n\nQ: What does your summoner name mean and why did you pick it?\n\nA: This name sucks and I cannot WAIT to change it.\n\nQ: Lastly, do you think you will still be playing in five years?\n\nA: Unless Rito dumpsters this shit, I'll be here for a good while.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RocketRelm","date":"2016-10-14T17:12:32.048+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"**Q: Who do you main, and why?**\nMorgana. Mid Lane, specifically. Because you can ram people for about as much damage as other midlaners, while being safe, providing obnoxious amounts of cc, never needing to interact with the lane past lvl 5. Your build is flexible, you can go DPS or Frontline from game to game. Your Q DDoS's the enemy from the game, and having a kindred lvl 3 flash tower dive and kill you, only to die from full hp  literally from just snare + 2  tower shots is 'soul crushing'. Your W provides obscene amounts of damage and clear, people seriously underestimate this. Your E is what Morgana is famous for now-a-days, and is Shenanigans Incarnate. Your R provides lots of peel, is Amumu level game warping in team fights, and actually allows you to 100-0 any  immobile midlaner (like syndra) at lvl 6.\n\n**Q: Do you prefer one trick or diversity?**\nI prefer some diversity, I play other champions, try them out, like Zyra and Zac, and in alternate game modes Trundle is hilarious. Morgana will always hold especial place in my heart though, even if most people have no idea how the bloody hell to play her, and try to say 'she has no damage', and 'morg so useless', when I'm the mvp of a team. Or my current favorite that happened not an hour ago, \"why don't you have more cs? Are you not maxing w?\" When I have more cs than literally everyone else except the other mid laner.\n\nSeriously, every time I see somebody building Morgana \"Morellos-Ludens-Rylais\" I fucking die a little inside.\n\n**Q: When did you start playing League, and who was your first champion?**\nI started in Season 2, Zyra Release patch. Back then zyra was a lot less fun and I never bothered. Morgana was actually at a height about that time in Mid Lane. A friend introduced me to the game, and described a few champions and their play styles, and even from the descriptions I knew Morgana was the one for me.\n\n**Q: Do you play ranked? When did you start? What did you achieve each season? What are your goals?**\nI played brief amount of ranked in season 3, swore it off until season 5 where I  placed in gold 5 and said fuck it this is fine. Only really 'tried' ranked this season and flipping between Plat 3 and Plat 2. I said I'd change my name to dDOSsnare if I made it to diamond, but I may revise that goal to 'get the last 5 wins to qualify for my Solo Ranked Badge'.\n\n\n**Q: What are your favorite things about League?**\nThere's so much, the changes, the environment, the ability to improve and the competition. I can't pick one, so I'll pick two. One; the feeling of self accomplishment, and  of innovating builds and making  Morgana work DESPITE the haters. Two; the salt. Your salt  'empowers' me. Give me every fucking 'drop' of it. \"wtf I flashed out of R\" is my favorite recurring one right now, though.\n\n… seriously, one day I shall collect **all** the salt, and feed it to summon the teemo in my cauldron. It shall be glorious.\n\n\n**Q: Have you made friends through playing League?**\nYes, I've made couple friends. None that do much with me outside of it, but there's some nice gaming groups. I'm hoping to meet more people, honestly. Been playing way too much solo lately.\n\n(especially  when a hidden passion of mine is listening to my friends get   angry, it's so fun, but I never 'try' to tilt my team. I'm a 'nice' person. I just revel in it).\n\n**Q: Lastly, do you think you will still be playing in five years?**\nIdk, probably. If the game's still here, I'll probably still be here. Enjoying whatever change happens around me.","replies":[{"poster":"Mira Arya Enthe","date":"2016-10-14T17:19:52.565+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love Morgana on my team.

In all games i have played, the support as always been the most appealing for me. The fact that you are the reason a teammate live because of you heal, shield or cc as always been more satisfying then killing something with a 1000 damage crit. Also, I always liked the support that have diversity in their kit. For example, I won't like a support that only heal {{champion:16}}  or a support that can only engages fights {{champion:89}} . So when Nami was out and I saw that she had two buffs, a stun, a heal and a tsunami, I knew she'd be one of my favorite supports. Being able to do some double hit bubbles is one of the most satisfying feeling in this game for me. Not to mention that I even once got 4 people with a single bubble (and yes, we won that fight lmao). She's an aggresive support with the option of being passive and with alot of of tools that can make her flexible enough to be good in each situations wich is why I like her alot..... also fish bewbs.\n\n**Q: Do you prefer one trick or diversity?**\n\nAs much as I know diversity is better for competitive games and all, I prefer on trick. Mastering a champion to it's full potential is something magical to achieve. Being able to be perfect with that champion and make everyone in your team wet/hard is really fun to do. Being called a god at the champion you play is also something I enjoy.\n\n**Q: Do you play ranked? When did you start? What did you achieve each season? What are your goals?**\n\nI started playing this game back in season 1 and started ranking with vladiqueer in season 2 in wich I only reached bronze. I really started playing rank more often in season 3 to get that victorious elise skin, in wich I failed by being silver 2 (started at bronze 4 and reached gold in pre season). In  season 4-5 I just played to get gold for those victorious skin. however this season is the season of my ascendance to Diamond (silver to diamond) and its the season I became a Nami OTP ( thought I played her since her release). \n\n**Q: What are you favorite things about league?**\n\nNami and lolhentai\n\n**Q: When did you start playing league, and who was your first champion?**\n\nMid season 1 and the first champion I have played was lmaokai. The first one I mained was vladimir in wich I stayed with him until season 4.\n\n**Q: Have you made friend through playing league?**\n\nDon't we all?\n\n**Q: Lastly, do you think you will still be playing league in five years**\n \nSadly, I dont think so. The support role is so dull that it makes me sad that I can't do much after the early game as a support. However, I am looking foward to the new supports item of this pre season.\n\n**Q: What does your summoner mean and why did you pick it?**\n\nGo on lolhentai and look at those nami pics. Also im a nami otp so I felt forced to put nami in my name.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tychusfindlay919","date":"2016-10-14T17:01:12.716+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Q1: I main {{champion:122}} because he represents noxian might. His ideals for a greater noxus and intellectual capabilities/political know-how are masked to those dumb enough to call him simply a brute. That being said, he is still powerful, and nothing feels better than dunking people. Dunks are great. The update made him incredibly enjoyable. The best part about him for me isn't really the dunk or any part of his kit. Ironically, it's a small visual/audio effect. Whenever you achieve noxian might, the screen flashes a particular color depending on the skin you're using and a loud sound (of which I cannot differentiate as coming from anything in particular) goes off. Another amazing small sound effect is that when noxian guillotine kills an enemy champion, there's a thundering sound of some sort.\n\nQ2: One trick all the way.\n\nQ3: I do play ranked, although I technically started on the back end of season 5, the vast majority of my league experience lies in Season 6. I started at bronze 3 and with relative ease, climbed up to platinum 1. I've been considering going for the D5 for the border next year but I lack motivation and college looms over my head. Many have accused me of boosting due to the speedy nature of my climb. What people fail to understand (and this could be gather from my username) is that I came to league from a now dead esport called starcraft. One thing to note about starcraft, if you think the pro gamers in league are impressive, you outta see what the starcraft bois pull out in terms of macromanagement and micromanagement. Starcraft has you controlling up to 200 units at once as well as numerous special structures with different abilities and production capabilities instead of one champion. It has the same viewing angle as league and relatively the same controls (right click to move/attack, a move commands, hotkeys for special abilities) but is slightly more complex with hotkeys not only for abilities but for groups of units. TL;DR I came from a game way more intense than league, and my speedy climb reflects that.\n\nQ4: Tail end of season 5. I mained support originally. I first mained blitzcrank. Then I mained thresh, and then for a long time I mained nasus. After nasus I decided to try out the Hand of Noxus and since have played him more than I have played any other champion combined, and I don't plan on maining anything else anytime soon.\n\nQ5: Its relative simplicity (which is somewhat under barrage as the game continues). It's more relaxing to play than starcraft (which honest to god is actually stressful, not sure how I or hundreds of thousands got into it before) and undeniably much easier to play.\n\nQ6: Yes I have. Some online only and some in real life.\n\nQ7: Tychus Findlay is a character from starcraft known for his badassery and incredibly large frame. He's a terminator-esque kind of guy but with some questionable things that loomed over his head before he was killed by his best friend in Starcraft 2 Wings of Liberty. I picked it because at the time I started league, I still had my biggest affinity for starcraft, and even now I still reminisce on the days of that once great esport, now long gone.\n\nQ8: If not league, then its successor, if league dies and there is no successor, it would pain me but I'd probably move on to a different game.","replies":[]}]}
