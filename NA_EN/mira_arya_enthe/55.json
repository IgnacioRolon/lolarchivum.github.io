Crownsguard declares Honor Duel to the death against Fiora's father, the head of House Laurent. \n\nLord Laurent, knowing he doesn't stand a chance, attempts and is caught trying to use a strength sapping poison against Crownsguard's champion, and issentenced for execution. To save their house, Fiora and her father enact an ancient Trial by Combat law against her father, with her and him fighting against one another. Fiora strikes the killing blow and \"wins\", becomes head of House Laurent and preventing the house from being exiled.  \n\nLux, being a daughter of Crownsguard, is why Fiora considers Lux a rival. Lux, having not paid attention to much to the matter due to having been away in training after being forced into army conscription by her parents at a young age, doesn't realize this and tries being friendly, and is rejected by Fiora.","replies":[{"poster":"Mira Arya Enthe","date":"2017-03-02T20:39:53.648+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for a real answer.

I just like thinking that Fiora sees so much of what she could of been in Lux and is hostile towards it because of how much she hated that possible life.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Tattersall","date":"2017-03-02T21:11:30.599+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think Ralanr has the correct answer.  Fiora looks down on Lux's life choices.  Fiora values independence, freedom, and the strength to be your own person.  She views Lux as a naive, weak-willed puppet of House Crownguard, always doing things just to please the family.  How much of this is true remains to be seen.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Melledoneus","date":"2017-03-02T14:07:55.251+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Two rich women competing to be the freatest.
