She takes FOREVER to kill once she has a couple tank items.\n\nAnybody in the game can build tank items. Her only tanking steroid is her passive, and it's not huge. She also has 0 lockdown and only mildly good initiation. Her abilities are an AA reset double hit that reduces cooldown with Attack Speed. An AoE burn and movement speed that increases duration with Attack Speed and does on hit flat damage with basic attacks. A Fireball that marks enemies to take bonus %HP damage from basic attacks. An ult that leaps and makes her damage AoE. None of these are tank. Not even Darius or Garen are tanks, they are Juggernauts, they take a while to kill and dish out damage while they soak some up. That would be like calling a fury warrior from WoW a tank.\n\nTanks need initiation and CC, that is why all the primary tanks in the game have it. Go to the champion roster and type in \"Tank\" to see everything Riot considers a tank. There are more than Riot considers a tank, like Hecarim who is played as a tank. But again, he has initiation and lockdown.","replies":[{"poster":"Lugg","date":"2016-09-19T14:47:09.730+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When a champion takes longer to kill than the actual so called tanks, they are a tank.

Doesn&#x27;t matter if they have CC or not. If you can soak up a ton of damage, you are a tank. End of story.\n\nUhm... They don't take longer than the actual tanks to kill. Shyvana's 20 bonus Armor and Magic Resist doesn't even compare to Leona's 60+20% Armor and Magic resist. Or Sion's immense max HP shield. Or Poppy's 20% max HP shield and +15% Armor and Magic Resist. Plus without Lockdown she doesn't live as long, because lockdown prevents the enemy from attacking. The enemy cannot dash into/away from Poppy, gets knocked up, pinned to a wall and slowed. Meaning they cannot deal as much damage to her OR HER TEAM! Which is the important part about a tank. When Leona jumps in with 290MR and 350Armor and 4000HP(More than Shyvana builds or can get as Leona's W is stronger) she is also rooting 1 person, stunning 1 person, stunning/slowing 1-5 people, then stunning somebody again in 5 seconds or less. Meaning during those windows she is reducing the damage dealt to herself AND HER TEAM. When Rammus activates his 120 bonus armor and magic resist(a lot more than 20) he also deals damage based on people attacking him, taunts 1 person and can knock up usually 1-3 people, providing CC for his team and reducing how much damage enemies deal to himself and HIS TEAM. When Sejauni gets her 25 armor and her kit deals damage based on HP meaning you build much tankier than Shyvana, she also knocks up 1-3 enemies does a long lasting stun on 1-5 enemies and slows 1-5 enemies, reducing their ability to damage her and HER TEAM. Noticing a trend? Tanks, real tanks, not only have stronger steroids, stronger base tanking stats, more encouragement to build tank and don't scale amazing with damage stats, but real tanks also lock down the enemies, reducing the damage said enemies do to them and THEIR TEAM. Also preventing the enemy from moving, coordinating and using abilities to disengage or engage themselves.\n\nShyvana jumps into a fight with 20 bonus armor and MR, does damage... that's it. Her Q is damage, her W is damage, her E is damage, her ult has a tiny and wonky knock back. Her entire kit scales off of attack speed and... that is it. She isn't even a 'drain tank' like Olaf or Attrox use to be considered. That isn't a tank. A tank has to be able to soak damage AND provide peel AND lockdown for their team.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"MunchCrunchLunch","date":"2016-09-19T08:03:00.643+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bot lanes that die 24 times + .","replies":[]},{"poster":"Michael702","date":"2016-09-19T07:18:48.470+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Before the game even starts.
