He's super fun to play!\n{{champion:72}} - While I hate his passive, he is still super fun to play. Been playing him before his rework and I still play him despite it <3\n\n**Visuals:**\n{{champion:28}} - I've always liked her, but her new splash gives me a ton of hope for her update\n{{champion:203}} - Probably one of my favorites. Love the Yin-Yang feel\n{{champion:157}} - I really like his visuals since he stands out from the others fairly well. The blue and silver are a great touch to his dark hair and rough appearance. He's pretty attractive not to mention ;o\n\n**Theme:**\n{{champion:57}} - One of my favorite ents. His design is pretty good since his update.\n{{champion:19}} - I'm still waiting on his update, but his current werewolf theme is pretty awesome!\n{{champion:3}} - He's a pretty unique take on being a gargoyle. Obviously he'll be getting an update, but I still like it nonetheless!\n\n**Personality:**\n{{champion:161}} - Knowledge is power! And I really like his VO~\n{{champion:202}} - His VO gives me shivers down my spine when playing him. Too good to keep the game quiet when playing as him. \n{{champion:420}} - I think she's pretty awesome. Also her accent is pretty nice on the ears~\n\n**Lore:**\n{{champion:131}} /{{champion:89}} - I prefer their old lore actually. At least their old personalities. I loved how before Leona was more patient and kind, whereas Diana was more about vengeance and wrath. It gave more depth to them instead of being the typical Sun = Fiery Passion and Moon = Calm and tranquil. Now they're kind of stereotypical, but still cool.\n{{champion:268}} - His was one of my favorite to read when he came out. I loved how they revamped Shurima around him and made is super in depth and even awe-inspiring.\n{{champion:157}} - I actually really enjoy his lore. There is still a veil of mystery around him, and I like how with {{champion:163}} 's release we got to see more into his past, and saw more of his personality!","replies":[{"poster":"Mira Arya Enthe","date":"2016-10-24T16:00:38.354+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"I certainly agree on Leona/Diana.
