A clever Thresh outplays them with mechanics. This is foreign to them. Why is this champion able to have all of these moves, abilities, stats and potential plays! Must not be fair. Because their stats were spot on and their strategy correct, so why could he nullify that by pushing buttons better? \r\n\r\nSome people are playing League of Fighting. The game is about RPG attributes and Fighting. They are likely VERY good with their champions. As they practice mechanics, know how to outplay and they understand what stats to what, how to work builds and who they can and cannot beat. But... despite winning their lane and having great KDAs they keep losing matches... they eventually assume it MUST be their teammates, because they have no idea how the game&#039;s strategy, teamwork, objectives, gold distribution and map awareness work. So all they see is themselves winning the fighting RPG, and their teammates somehow losing the match.\r\n\r\nSome people are playing a mechanically challenging strategy game. They are working wonders with their kit, they are amazing with their champion. They know where all the right objectives are. They coordinate well with their team and never get ganked... then Darius kills them. They feel powerless, they used all their skills, but he just walked up and beat them to death despite them having better positioning, teamwork and mechanics... why is Darius so OP? They likely ask themselves.\r\n\r\nSome people may mix and match attributes of each.  But generally people make the mistake of playing LoL as a Strategy game, a Fighting game, an RPG stat game, or some mix of two of these. But the best/happiest players I see, who enjoy the game the most and complain the least. Seem to be the ones that understand, League of Legends is ALL of these. It is a strategy game that is won through superior understanding of the map, objectives, teamwork, meta, stats, better mechanical prowess and overall greater grasp of how the game functions, knowing how to optimize your champions stats, advantages and play them around other champion&#039;s kits, knowing what team comps are and how they affect you, and who you should pick based on that.\r\n\r\nSo yes. League can be a... mostly balanced, and fun home for players of {{champion:92}} AND {{champion:86}} AND {{champion:16}}. Not just one play style, ALL playstyles. You just have to understand, it is not a {{item:3044}} or {{item:3101}} or {{item:3057}} but it is a {{item:3078}}","replies":[{"poster":"Schàdenfreude","date":"2017-01-02T05:04:29.034+0000","up_votes":35,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why does two blue swords and a hammer turn into two yellow swords and a blue sword?","replies":[{"poster":"Rebonack","date":"2017-01-02T05:11:14.034+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=HackRawESOMe,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=g4qJBcQq,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-01-02T05:04:29.034+0000)\n>\n> Why does two blue swords and a hammer turn into two yellow swords and a blue sword?\n\nBecause it used to build out of Zeal and Sheen.

You need to optimize your stats to get the best chance of winning, and different characters have different stats and thus different strengths and weaknesses to play around.  The only downside is that some champions have better numbers at a given time than others, and simply cause a worse player to beat a better player.  If this ever got to a perfectly balanced state, and all champions were updated where necessary, I think the game could be a lot better.
