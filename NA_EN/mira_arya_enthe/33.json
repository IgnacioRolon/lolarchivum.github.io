So now ADCs don&#x27;t touch them.\n\nHonestly, the reason why ADC's get those items nerfed, (or nerfed for them) is they never seem to give up enough for those extra defenses. Realistically they should be forfeiting damage, since ADC's pretty much rely on stacking AD, AS, and Crit chance at the same time. Yet those items gave them enough damage while offering those tanky stats. \n\nArguably because of their High DPS, their Tank(ish) option should be Life steal, even though it doesn't help much against burst. And people just complain about ADC's having no dueling power. But realistically, they need to forgo that power in exchange for the objective taking power, afforded to them for being the glass cannon.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"junglerboy16","date":"2017-03-13T00:42:55.751+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mainly because they provide nothing to their team if they don't deal damage (with a few odd exceptions like Ashe and co.)\n\nThe fundamental reason for picking an ADC is to deal damage, and if you aren't getting more damage, you fall further behind because an extra tiny bit of durability (unless it has damage attached to it like Merc scimitar) means nothing if you still can't kill the enemy before they kill you.\n\nThis has only become more of an issue recently because of damage creep, but ADCs are and should always be looking to get lucky kills in a fight to pull themselves back in, otherwise they are dead weight on their team.","replies":[{"poster":"Skins Project","date":"2017-03-13T01:46:35.037+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Remember me...\n-{{item:3022}}","replies":[{"poster":"junglerboy16","date":"2017-03-13T02:06:17.490+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Too situational really, and it's not nearly as strong as you'd expect outside one-on-one interactions ever since they nerfed slows to not stack.
