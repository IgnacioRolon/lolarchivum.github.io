And I noticed the best feeling DoTs in games are like Heroes of the Storm. Where the dot is a smooth, easy to read drain. Not a: 100... 100... 100... but instead: 10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10... etc.\r\n\r\nI don&#039;t even play Singed, and the change to his poison made me soooooo happy. Like even playing against him it is so much easier to read and feels better to both beat and be beaten by.\r\n\r\nCan we just... do this for all DoT effects? smooth them out to be more of a consistent drain or at least more rapid, smaller ticks? I think that would be amazing.","replies":[{"poster":"Keira Helsh","date":"2016-10-08T23:24:14.378+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh definitely, I totally see where you're coming from.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Anonagon","date":"2016-10-08T23:33:27.839+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"I had to do it for Malicious Metal and his Rylais threads, so I'll do it for you too\n\nDon't make so many threads on similar topics.

First of all are you a moderator?\n\nSecond of all. I made a post about buffing Shyvana, where adjusting her W tick rate was mentioned in it as ONE change. This post is about the DoT design of the entire game. Now maybe you are a moderator in disguise. But I do not see any moderation tag so I don't know why you are going around telling people what to do with their posts.","replies":[{"poster":"Anonagon","date":"2016-10-08T23:49:36.290+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"It's a friendly suggestion, not an order.

If I felt the topics were similar enough I would have bumped it, as it is already popular. But this topic is about the overall design of League, not the one champion I onetrick on. I was a mod on 3 different forums and an admin on one. Sure they were just fan sites, but I know the basics of moderation. My post had to be separate because the topics were. \n\nIt wasn't \nMorde will be dumpstered\nIf Rylai's morde will die\nMorde will be bad\nHow to fix more if Rylai's dumpsters him\n\nAnd while he is right on his topic, he shouldn't spam that so much.\n\nMy posts were\nShyvana's DoT should be adjusted for quality of life purposes\nShyvana buff ideas in general, which included the DoT concept just because I already had it in mind\nDoTs in the game should be smoothed out in general\n\nI feel these are plenty different enough, or I simply would have bumped the first one as it already is 34+ likes so bumping it would have been more in my favor if I was trying to prove a point. I do all my forum dumping in a big tangent, then get off to game or work. So all my posts will be clustered most of the time.","replies":[{"poster":"Anonagon","date":"2016-10-09T01:32:07.604+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I wasn't trying to actually make a direct comparison between your posts and MM's, but if we're doing it then I have to say that your posts are a lot more similar to his than you make it out to be\n\nYou first thread brought two major topics: \"Shyvana could use changes\" and \"Higher tickrates on DoTs feel nice\"\nYour second thread is an elaboration on the first topic, and this thread is an elaboration on the second\nJust like how all of MM's threads were related to the general topic of \"Morde and Rylais\", even when he didn't directly mention Morde, your posts are all related to the topic of \"Shyvana and her DoT\", even when you don't mention her (like in this thread).\nIt's not a huge problem or anything, its just that there's really very little reason that the discussions caused by this thread and the one before couldn't also exist in the first thread.\n\nI have also been a moderator on a fan forum before, but I didn't come here to talk from that perspective.
