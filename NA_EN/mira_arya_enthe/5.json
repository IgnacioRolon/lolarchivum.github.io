I have a bunch of games on Karma, I moderate the [KarmaMains subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/karmamains/), [I have written a guide on Mobafire](http://www.mobafire.com/league-of-legends/build/the-twin-dragons-of-ionia-460281), I have crafted at least 5 renditions of a Karma rework (and many balance changes)...hell I've even wrote an essay for high school English on the ideology of Karma.\n\n\nHowever, I am not afraid to say that if Karma's popularity rose to the point where I was not able to play her with certainty that she would be picked or banned nearly every game, my love for her would remain, but I don't think I would play her as much. \n\nNevertheless, the sheer amount of games, posts, essays, guides, and builds that I have played/wrote in honor of the preservation and improvement of Karma could never be devalued or used to devalue another person's dedication to her. She. Is. My. Favorite. Champion. One can also be a dedicated OTP / main without doing any of that. \n\n\nThe self-given title of OTPing / Maining a champion isn't _just_ something that you gain through thousands of games or doing stuff related to the champion. It's about the love, dedication, and fun that you get out of playing a champion. Your above disqualifiers are incredibly unfair to players when put in certain scenarios. Being an OTP / Main is letting the champion affect your IRL self whether it be emotions, ideals, or simply the desire to play them constantly.\n\nFor example: Person A might have seen Karma in LCS recently and loved her and started playing her as much as they could. If you're playing a champion because you find them fun, why is that something bad? If you want to claim them as your main champion, why can't you? It's almost as if you're trying to make OTPing / Maining a champion seem like an elitist thing. I used to think the same way and it **REALLY** is not.\n\nI started playing Ivern a bunch yesterday because I like him (not as much as Karma). However, that doesn't make me not a Karma one trick. My dedication is still with Karma and I play her in every single ranked game that is possible. As for normals, since I dread them and only use them for practice, I try not to play her as much. I don't....want to go in a normal game, play my main, and destroy their mid laner who is practicing a foreign champion. As cocky as that sounds, it often happens and I don't really find it entertaining or something that I want on my conscience. \n\nAt the end of the day, I welcome anyone to use my favorite champion in any way and while I say that \"If Karma becomes FOTM...blah blah blah\" to my friends, she will forever be my favorite champion.\n\nhttp://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/6/6d/Karma_Render.png/revision/latest?cb=20140402061159\n\n>#Sae Eleisa Tera Vi of _truly_ being an OTP","replies":[{"poster":"Mira Arya Enthe","date":"2016-10-22T02:11:57.899+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":6,"body":"Not even close.

I unashamedly say I main the new Yorick.  No more than 50% of my games are with him though, and he's pretty new, so I can't cite 2000 ranked games as ethos, but right now he's one of my favorites, even if they find a reason to nerf him to shit.  I simply like his gameplay and his lore.  One day I may stop maining him, and main a different champ in my pool of about 20, but that doesn't mean I don't main him right now.\n\nWhat I wouldn't call a main is a champ that you picked up for 2 days after a rework made them broken.  You have to like the feel of the champ, not just the winrate.\n\nNow a one-trick is very strict.  You play that champ, and that champ only.  If you main Zed mid and demand that you get mid every time the game assigns you top.  Now that doesn't mean you can't have a toplaner for if you don't get to switch, but over 90% of your games are with that champ.\n\nAn expert on one champ is someone who not only plays enough games to call them a main, but has enough experience, skill, and knowledge to write a good guide on them.  Not everyone can claim to be an expert on even their most dedicated main.\n\nWhy you have to prove that you're being an expert with (possibly one-tricking) Shyvana is superior to other peoples' maining champs only makes you look like an idiot.
