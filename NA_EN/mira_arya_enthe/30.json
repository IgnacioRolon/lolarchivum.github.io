Mages are a varied class and contain lots of different archetypes. It would be nice if the item choices for each type were more pronounced. Right now it's either morello's, roa, or tear first item, then either a defensive ap item (rylai's,zhonya's, abyssal) then void then luden's/ dcap or skip those for more ap defensive items because you don't want to get blown up instantly. \nWould be nice if each item played more to its intended niche( liandry's to tank shredding, luden's to AoE and mobility, abyssal for close range mages). Right now an ap item is either great or bad, there seems to be no in between.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Sexualsaurus","date":"2017-04-11T19:24:56.195+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"Next thing you'll know is that they'll probably want {{item:3047}} to be buffed to 15% auto attack reduction...","replies":[{"poster":"Lauchmelder","date":"2017-04-11T19:36:46.128+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":5,"body":"I wouldn't call it balanced.\n\nBut I also wouldn't mind to have it just as a big FU to some AD mains on the boards.","replies":[{"poster":"Sexualsaurus","date":"2017-04-11T19:41:43.506+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":3,"body":"I hate ninja tabi with passion, it sucks when the entire enemy team has it as well because of how gold efficient it is x(","replies":[{"poster":"Lauchmelder","date":"2017-04-11T19:42:43.113+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":6,"body":"Well I also think that it's too strong right now.

But if tanks get forced out of lane that much more easily by bruisers, they will fall further behind in items and thus the change is less gold efficient even if 10 armor = 75 hp. Very simple math there sir/ma'am. Although now that I've learned there are updates to ad items as well - with less overall armor pen, the changes don't sound nearly so bad. Less armor pen means not as much of the extra armor gets negated by simply buying a last whisper item or black cleaver - meaning the lost hp doesn't matter AS MUCH at least in mid-late game when you have multiple items.

But the other changes you bring up are scary, especially the runnans change. Botrk and runnans will be mandatory on adcs.\n\nedit: Riot are buffing last whisper vs tanks BUT MAKING IT LOOK LIKE A NERF! With those 3 example armour items you gain 29 armour compared to this patch but lose 225 hp! With the 5% extra damage vs high hp it is even stronger vs tanks than before","replies":[{"poster":"WiegrafOfValor","date":"2017-04-11T20:50:06.285+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"> edit: Riot are buffing last whisper vs tanks BUT MAKING IT LOOK LIKE A NERF!

Another MR item is just a nerf to every AP champ and a buff to tanks who already take 0 damage from burst mages. I love playing Nasus, building only {{item:3065}} and laugh as AP champs can't even dent my HP. Meanwhile I'm still getting shredded to pieces with 300 armor by AD champs.","replies":[]}]}
