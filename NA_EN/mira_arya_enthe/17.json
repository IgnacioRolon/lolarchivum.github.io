Also, like with Riven, I knew zero about Yasuo when I set out to make this post. I had to go and spend a lot of time, my time, watching videos, reading guides and losing ten games as him before I understood what it was like to play him on a shallow and generic level. So Yasuo mains may not approve of everything in this post. I do please ask that both Yasuo players, and haters, keep an open mind when reading this. Please read the entire post and then comment constructively if you feel the need to. I would rather have a discussion on the matter than a rage fest of angry, bias and hateful players. Oddly enough I am more worried about haters than mains... probably past experience trying to post about Riven. Also I am a silver player, I don&#039;t really try to climb, I am more interested in game design and characters than I am in having a badge to show off.\n\n#My Findings\n**Skillcap**\nOh fuck is Yasuo hard. People who hate him would like to claim otherwise but he is very hard to play well as *consistently* across many games unless you were born with an Otaku, Bleach watching, &quot;Ninja sword&quot; wielding, correcting people when they call Japanese animations &quot;cartoons&quot; beast inside you who has been yearning to come out all your life. Yasuo is quite hard to play well as. Not just because I lost most my games as him either. Statistically it is backed up, logically it is backed up and anybody who plays him for their first 15 games as him will understand. That said, Skillcap, like skillshots, counterplay, winrates and the like, doesn&#039;t always mean a design is healthy. We will talk more on that later.\n\n**Fun**\nYas Yasuo is fun, even losing on him he is incredibly fun to play. Mind you, I am neither a fan of Anime nor the champion, but he is still very fun to play. &quot;But fun is subjective!&quot; Playrates are not, neither are skin releases. Playrates and the champions Riot most often release skins for are a huge indication of which champions people most enjoy playing, whether it be for aesthetics, lore, voice acting, gameplay or so forth. Something about that character is liked. Despite his high ban rate, like Ahri, Riven or Lucian he always maintains a decently high playrate. He is fun to play for a larger number of people than otherwise.\n\n**Statistics and balance**\nYasuo is not imbalanced. I know a great number of his detractors would stop reading here out of close mindedness. But the fact is, he is not &#039;the most OP thing in the history of DOTA!&#039; Because so many people hate fighting him and ban him so often it is hard to get a true read on his statistics. Even if a tad over or under tuned however Yasuo isn&#039;t &#039;unfair&#039; from a balance standpoint. But don&#039;t worry, there will be some negative talk shortly.\n\n**A good concept**\nYasuo is a very good champion *concept* I just think the execution was a tad off but. I mean nothing is perfect. The idea is he can dash to multiple targets like Yi but is exposed while doing so, he also controls the dashes making it less Luck/Statcheck and more controlled and skill based. He has empowered AAs like Yi but instead of just making his AAs better half of them are skillshots which can be dodged, a bad Yasuo will miss more but bad players will dodge fewer, good players will dodge more and good Yasuo&#039;s will hit more. Scaling with skill is always good because it keeps a champion as relevant in Bronze as they are in challenger unlike stat champions who either are just tuned too high for Bronze or too low for Challenger. His wind wall gives him the tools to solo lane vs mages so we can have a melee fighter go mid. His double crit allows for build flexibility and earlier powerspikes to make up for being a melee ADC. His ult gives him a lot of power but makes it team synergistic and skill based rather than just R to win like some champions have. That said, while it is great on paper it does have issues.\n\n#So what is &#039;wrong&#039; with Yasuo\nWhen I set out to make this post, I intended to defend him like I have done with Riven, Marksmen and Darius in the past. But the truth is, I cannot... but no, this isn&#039;t just a circlejerk saying &quot;I couldn&#039;t because he is total bullshit and should be removed #cancer!&quot;. There are two very specific parts of his kit I just thing do not work, and a few others I feel could use some minor editing. But I like to think positively so let&#039;s talk about the good first.\n\n**The Good Stuff**\nPassive: \nI think Yasuo&#039;s shield is fine and 100% should stay. Yasuo&#039;s shield gives him trading power that otherwise would hardly exist, and it lets him lane vs ranged enemies who otherwise would stomp a squishy melee who doesn&#039;t have the HP regen and tank stats to deal with ranged poke. Almost all Skirmishers, Divers and Juggernauts have a defensive ability on a short CD(Riven&#039;s E, Fiora&#039;s Parry, Darius Q), and most of them who don&#039;t have some sort of passive sustain/steroid(Nasus Passive, Garen&#039;s W) or steroid that is always active or a long CD but powerful steroid(Garen&#039;s W). Yasuo&#039;s passive is plenty in line with the design of your A-Typical Skirmisher, and while I know a lot of people hate it, I think it would be fine to have if other things in his kit changed. It shows it&#039;s fullness, it has down time, it can be removed with a love tap, doesn&#039;t help him vs turret or minions and overall seems fair outside the context of certain other assets.\n\nQ:\nI think Yasuo&#039;s Q is perfectly fine. I might lower how long he can hold onto his third Q so he cannot just zone you for a full 10 seconds like Jhin does with his 4th shot. Or perhaps narrow the Tornado. But otherwise I am fine with this ability. It is no different than any other melee carries AA boost except that it can be missed and in return gets to be a tiny AoE. It gives him the DPS steroid melee carries are suppose to have but is skill based, it scales well with the skill of the Yasuo player and his enemies. \n\nE:\nAfter a couple nerfs I think his E is actually fine. The dashes are annoying and resource-less but it is a conditional dash that requires planning and skill to use. I might consider making it so enemies and allies can see the CD of his dash on targets to make counterplay and strategies regarding it more apparent, I highly doubt this would &#039;gut&#039; him as some extremist mains might try to say, as high level players already track his dash targets mentally, it would simply make counterplay vs him in lower tiers more apparent. \n\nR:\nAfter adjustments to the armor pen mechanic this ability is mostly fine. It is a conditional ult that cannot just be pushed at any time like most others in the game. It doesn&#039;t actually do a lot of damage on it&#039;s own the suspension, lifesteal, shield and armor pen are the most important things that come from it.\n\n**The Bad stuff**\nDouble Crit Chance:\nIn my very unprofessional opinion this feature of his kit can never be healthy. While it can be &#039;balanced&#039; from a win/play rate point of view, it has severe design problems. The problem with granting double crit chance is that it assures Yasuo can reach 100% damage efficiency with only 2 crit items. Now I choose my words carefully, mains who are about to say &quot;But Yasuo needs to build!&quot; Yes, Yasuo can and usually will build other damage items. But the thing is, the weakness of Crit as a mechanic is that it amplifies overall damage with each % that you get. You reach 100% damage efficiency with 100% crit. That also comes with reliability, when crit is designed to be unreliable. Riot&#039;s crit mechanic making it reliable on Ashe resulted in nerf after nerf after nerf to her overall DPS output and the fact that she gets 0 burst, even then she still has to get 100% to get 100% out of her passive. Giving this kind of reliability and free power spiking in Yasuo&#039;s kit has allowed toxic things like tank Yasuo as well as Yasuo getting &#039;shut down&#039; but unlike Riven he becomes relevant the second laning ends anyway and gets a quadra shortly after. I feel this mechanic is a problem.\n\nWindwall:\nFrom a balance point of view this ability is 100% A-O-K. But this is probably the biggest &#039;anti-fun&#039; middle finger in LoL alongside Tahm stealing an ADC right before you kill them or Lulu&#039;s point and click Polymorph. They are abilities that aren&#039;t even all that fun for the user. But they make the enemies utterly miserable. The thing is, in most games people would tell you to suck it up and git gud. But Riot caters a lot to the whiners and crybabies. The thing is, that is fine. While whiners are annoying it is nice to see one game care about fun alongside balance. So this ability goes against their policy that something should provide a healthy equilibrium of fun and upset when successfully used. Wind wall has the unfortunate design of Yasuo just throwing it out haphazardly in mid game and without any skill or effort deletes 2 incoming ults in a team fight and completely removes the fun out of the game for your mage, enchanter and marksman as well as shutting your Sej out of the fight because her ult was swallowed up. Meanwhile the amount of fun it provides to be used is... eh. it feels okay sometimes but most the time the fun of Yasuo is just running in and killing shit or using your skills to 1v1 like a true weeblord. Windwall takes minimal skill to use in lower tiers. It can just be tossed out and removed fun from the game. I think it is a huge problem.\n\n#What would I change about Yasuo?\nHere is the segment you should take with a grain of salt, or in the case of some players a fucking dumptruck of salt. Because the thing is I don&#039;t know Yasuo&#039;s design extremely well, I studied it the best I could but suck at him. But despite that I don&#039;t believe in complaining without offering resolutions, so here are a Silver Shyvana one trick&#039;s suggestions on how to &#039;fix&#039; Yasuo.\n\n**Nerfed**\n&bull; Gathering Storm duration reduced to 5 seconds.\n\n&bull; Sweeping Blade now displays CD indicators for enemies and allies as well.\n\n**Buffed**\n&bull; Resolve shield increased to 110 - 600 based on level.\n\n&bull; Base HP, AD, Armor and Magic resist increased by noticeable amounts.\n\n&bull; Steal Tempest base damage increased to 30/60/90/120/150.\n\n**Reworked**\nIntent: No longer grants double critical strike chance. Instead Yasuo&#039;s basic attacks will now strike for bonus damage based on his critical strike chance and increased by critical strike damage like Ashe&#039;s passive, except no bonus 10% to start with as currently he starts with no benefit from the double crit without crit chance anyway. Instead he will scale slightly harder with the crit. Yasuo&#039;s Q will also benefit including the base damage. \n\nWindwall: Yasuo will create a blast of air in a 180&deg; half circle knocking enemies in melee range back a short distance(does not count as Airborne for his ultimate) dealing 15/30/45/60/75 damage increased by 2% for every 1% of critical strike chance Yasuo has and blocking ALL attacks against him for .75 seconds. After that it will expand out into a wall that will slow projectiles that pass through it by 20/25/30/35/40% and reduce their damage, debuffs and crowd control effects by an equal amount. \n\n**Reasoning**\nMy *goal* was to place more power into being skilled at Yasuo and less into stat checking with 100% crit chance and tanky itemization options. Nerfs to Gathering Storm and Sweeping Blade are to reduce frustration laning vs Yasuo, but aren&#039;t big enough to completely destroy him. \n\nBuffs to Resolve, HP, Armor and MR make up some survivability lost in laning and team fighting from the change to windwall as well as lost lifesteal from the removal of double crit. \n\nThe Buffs to base AD and Steal Tempest base damage was to try to offset SOME of the lost damage from double crit. All these changes to damage would actually be a slight buff to a 0% crit chance Yasuo in fact. \n\nReworked intent will force Yasuo to actually build damage if he wants damage. It will keep the reliability of 100% crit so he doesn&#039;t feel crappy(I hate RNG too, I play Ashe for a reason), but he would have to buy 100% crit to get 100% benefit. I'd like the numbers to be edited in a way that allows Yasuo to scale up to just a tad higher than the current when accounting for loss of double crit itemization and the crit damage reduction being removed. But not too much as the goal is to force him out of building 2 damage items and making up for going 0/10/0 in laning. This should give him less of a power spike with each crit item purchased, compensated for in other abilities above, but a stronger final result when nearing full build on a damage build.\n\nWindwall change will make Yasuo even higher skillcap. He will gain some damage on it to compensate the lost damage of double crit chance, the damage will scale with his crit chance as well, the damage is minor and only melee range however. The change to the wall itself means he only gets to fully eat projectiles for the first .75 seconds, more like a spellshield, but it eats ALL attacks now not just ranged, timing it perfectly would be a skill to make Yasuo very lethal. Now once beyond that .75 seconds the wall will only nerf projectiles speed and effectiveness by a % scaling with level. I feel this would be far less toxic. Yasuo could no longer invalidate half a team with a haphazardly button press, but still has the overall utility of the wall and during that initial burst it has gained power. Why? Because again, Yasuo is balanced mostly fine right now, he is just frustrating to fight. So all nerfs must come with compensation. His wall got a little better when used as a timed block, but the overall brainless anti-fun part has been toned down ~~plus seeing 40% slowed global ults in some Vandiril video would be fun~~.\n\n#Again, take the rework suggestion with a grain of salt!\nI am no Yasuo expert, I simply believe in providing suggestions when complaining. If you have a better suggestion, or feel you could fine tune this one to be better. Feel free to post below.\n\nAnyway! That is my Yasuo post. I hope it wasn&#039;t too ignorant or silly. My goal was simply to convey this, Yasuo is a fun champion, a good design concept, from a *balance* standpoint he is &#039;fair&#039; and he takes a lot of skill to play well. That said he has some frustrating aspects, and I think I highlighted the right ones in pointing to Windwall, the duration of his third Q and how his double crit chance interacts with itemization and powerspikes. Hope you enjoyed.\n\nWith the best intentions - Mira Arya Enthe.","replies":[{"poster":"AmazoX","date":"2017-04-18T05:56:06.242+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's okay Mira, Though, With these changes, The damage Yasuo would output would be *very much buffed* once he gets the items needed.\n\nThis is a very risky rework though, Good Yasuo's will be even much harder to take down as their damage would be buffed so would their base defensive stats which would make his laning phase much easier IMO.\n\nHe'll basically become Jayce level oppressive in lane after the passive shield & base defensive stats are buffed but with trade offs of course that slows his scaling speed, His weak point would be I suppose mid-game as he wouldn't achieve 100% Critical Chance.\n\n* You nullified *to some extent* his wind wall toxicity but several other parts of his kit are buffed at certain time periods in a match where he would much stronger, I think this rework isn't perfect but it's good enough, Although just mark my words, He'll become much more oppressive if these changes go through due to the defensive base stats & passive shield buff he receives trading off with slowing his scaling speed and nullifying his wind wall's effectiveness.\n\n\n\n\n* Now, Why would he become more oppressive? As people (*Haters*) claim that Yasuo's early game is incredibly strong, IT REALLY ISN'T, Early game is the part where it's risky but also rewarding if you get through it fine and get your core items (Reaching 100% Critical Chance), You would make getting through early game much more easier, and you have suggested removing double critical chance, That's completely fine but once he gets the necessary items to output damage it would be very difficult to deal with him thanks to his base stats being buffed and easy early game, Now why would he deal more damage? While I am sure you guys know that Yasuo has a hidden critical strike penalty in his Way of the Wanderer's double critical chance passive: \n\nSteel Tempest has a hidden critical strike penalty that reduces all critical strikes damage by a further 15% from his 10% reduced critical strike damage off his Auto-Attacks, Which means Steel Tempest critically strikes for 75% of the damage, And only critical strikes on the AD portion (The bonus damage is added on unchanged regardless of whether it crit or not)\n\nTL;DR the bad side of the passive of double critical chance are: \nSteel Tempest has a 25% reduced critical strike damage.\nAuto-Attacks have a 10% reduced critical strike damage.\n55% capped Attack-speed from items.\n\nNow what you have suggested is nerfing his defensive ability that nullifies majority of the abilities in league of legends which *haters* find very toxic, Slowing his scaling speed, Now in return you are buffing base stats and his passive shield which wouldn't make it too difficult for the player to go through the slower scaling speed due to the defensive buffs, Now of course you players wouldn't mind this because the Yasuo player is scaling slower thus you don't have to deal with his 100% Critical Chance damage with just two items, But the thing is (IMO FLAW) is that once he gets the item's needed, He'll pump out much more damage due to the removal of the hidden reduced critical strike damage which also has a cap on 55% AS from items, You guys see what the situation would become, Yes? \n\n\nThis overall reduces the toxicity his wind wall brought to the haters & slowers his scaling speed but it doesn't make it any harder for the Yasuo player but in fact his going to be more oppressive in lane which would result in LOW ELO players to give into tilt very easily & also the HIGH ELO players specifically those who are impatient and also give into tilt easily when facing Jayce level of oppressiveness. This is overall a huge buff to his damage but slowers the time it takes for Yasuo to get his damage going but his toughness is going to get buffed with the trade-off to nullifying wind wall's effectiveness to some extent. Now how are the players going to deal with a tougher Yasuo early-game who doesn't do as much damage and is harder to kill but also who becomes an unstoppable force at 28th-30th minute mark, His double critical chance passive is what balancing him right now, Without the passive which has the *penalties*, The combination of his kit with the proper items is devastating, And IMO, He would be changed from Skirmisher into a Bruiser with this strong rework, Just like how Rengar was changed from an Assassin to his best build ever since the rework was playable: Bruiser\n\nIt's a very notable rework.\n\nPlease, Comment your opinions fellow players, Applause for Mira taking the time to type all that down, I appreciate the none-biased opinion on the boards from a fellow player where the circlejerk with Yasuo is strong. {{sticker:zombie-brand-clap}} \n\n\nWhat is your perfect goal that you have for Yasuo in your mind Mira, How do you want to see him?","replies":[{"poster":"Mira Arya Enthe","date":"2017-04-18T06:19:09.911+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"You know. I actually forgot the crit reduction despite reminding myself to account for it like 4 times while researching this. But I think that could be solved simply through the number tuning of the passive itself, by tuning the numbers in a manner that his end game is about equal or slightly higher than it is now instead of massively stronger. Thank you for reminding me.\n\nI'd like to see him as somebody who is strong early game if played well but not too oppressive. With an average mid game if he has played well thus far, and a strong late game. If he plays badly I would like to see an average early game, bad mid game and below average late game. \n\nMy desire is to see him as a viable, powerful, but fair high skillcap champion who rewards effort and teamwork with a fun and impactful gameplay pattern.

In my (also unprofessional) opinion, it screws with the balancing of every other champion.  It suddenly adds another aspect of strength or weakness to abilities; whether they act as projectiles or not.\n\nThat means that there is an entirely different, additional realm of balance every time Yasuo is in a game.  This is also an aspect of champion abilities that cannot really be rebalanced.  You also cannot balance champions over the abilities being projectile or not because other they will be overpowered or underpowered when Yasuo (and Braum) are not in the game.\n\nBasically as far as I can tell, it impacts the strength of champions in a way that cannot (without massive effort) be balanced around.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KoKoboto","date":"2017-04-18T18:02:54.823+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Pretty much 2x crit chance makes the champion BS.

People think that is broken and OP, but in reality, it is what keeps him squshy.\n\nLet me explain.\n\nYes, he gets two items for 100% crit chance. If you don't build damage, YOU WON'T DO DAMAGE. Luckly for him he has the capacity for a tank item. if he ends up getting so fed that he can get more than one tank item, you fucked up. Hard. That was entirely your fault and you should feel bad about it. In regards to your changes to his crit...\n\nNo, just No.\n\nIf you want Tanksuo (){{item:3078}}{{item:3111}}{{item:3022}}{{item:3748}}{{item:3026}}{{item:3065}}) Then by all means. His crit makes him build damage. If you were to remove his crit passive then you have to do one of two things: make another 20% crit item that does not give Mana or CDR, or remove the crit requirement on his ulti, either way, you just fucked yourself, he is going to go tanksuo from now on.\n\nYasuo's windwall is a beautiful ability. It is not AT ALL worth the cool-down to block one ranged ability or auto. But when the entire team shoots everything at you, it is magnificent. It is a massive middle finger, but you could say the same thing about Shen's W. The cool-down is massive, and it takes a good player to re-position around him. That is why he is busted down in Bronze ELO. They can't do shit to work together or counter him and Yasuo can rub it in their faces.\n\nYour ideas have promise, and I wouldn't hate to see his W changed a bit, but not in that way. His crit is a CORE part of his cit, taking that away would ruin him. In total your ideas would bring back Tanksuo, and no one wants that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Catastrop","date":"2017-04-18T12:39:35.586+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Oh Mira, there was no need for the disclaimer, we know that unlike 90% of the Boards' population you're actually a reasonable person.

In terms of League I'd like to consider myself fairly unbiased as I have played every role to nearly the same amounts and every champion at least a couple times except Olaf(You'll notice I post very few views on him).\n\nI also just enjoy the characters, game overall strategy and the ever shifting gameplay that is League of Legends. So I don't have a lot of investment in hating any champion. And the ones I hate like say, Darius, I even then make myself accept that he is probably the best designed Juggernaut.

One is sound, the other is \"self air-born ing\"\n\nPersonally I'd be making yasuo's Q \"hasagi\" only heard on yasuo's side. Once yas had a PD that sound is popping up every few seconds and turning down any of yasuo means turning down everyone.\nPlayers still hear the spells winding up sound as the duration ticks down and he displays a clear visual indication of having the tornado Q. Thus the absence of \"hasagi\" will in no way shape or form affect his viability.\n\nAnd his E sound. I've seen many a player get tilted from the non stop \"swoosh\" spam in lane and rush in to try and remove the source of this sound from the map. While I rarely have to vs yasuo, the few times I have is up top and if I'm an immobile jug like illaoi or yorick, it feels pretty demoralising having this yasuo swooshing all around me while I can't do anything to stop him with my sluggish move speed and telegraphed spells.\nWhile good players tilt less in general and I doubt good yasuo's spend their time spamming E, I feel removing the possibility of \"swoosh\" spam would be an overall health buff to everyone if it's sound affect is toned down (less volume, lower pitch ect).\n\n\nAs for the second part, {{champion:154}} {{champion:133}} {{champion:121}} can all make themselves air born and yasuo can ult off of them.

While it can be &amp;#039;balanced&amp;#039; from a win/play rate point of view, it has severe design problems. The problem with granting double crit chance is that it assures Yasuo can reach 100% damage efficiency with only 2 crit items. Now I choose my words carefully, mains who are about to say &amp;quot;But Yasuo needs to build!&amp;quot; Yes, Yasuo can and usually will build other damage items. But the thing is, the weakness of Crit as a mechanic is that it amplifies overall damage with each % that you get. You reach 100% damage efficiency with 100% crit.\n\nWhy is this a problem lass? I'm not sure I follow.\n\n> That also comes with reliability, when crit is designed to be unreliable.\n\nIt isn't on Yasuo. His kit is built around factoring in that at some point he is getting 100% crit.\n\n> Riot&amp;#039;s crit mechanic making it reliable on Ashe resulted in nerf after nerf after nerf to her overall DPS output and the fact that she gets 0 burst, even then she still has to get 100% to get 100% out of her passive.\n\nAshe's kit is such that she dominates professional play when she is meta, and is even a prominent pick when garbage in solo queue. The same is not true of Yasuo. Ashe also has incredibly utility for an ADC, more than Yasuo has anyway, and when she was meta her DPS was one of the highest in her class despite her incredible utility. By contrast, Yasuo's DPS is lower than skirmishers like Tryndamere (who also arguably has higher burst), Master Yi (ditto), and perhaps Fiora. His DPS is fairly middling compared to others in his class.\n\n> Giving this kind of reliability and free power spiking in Yasuo&amp;#039;s kit has allowed toxic things like tank Yasuo\n\nWhoa whoa whoa whoa HOLD ON, Yasuo's crit passive had NOTHING to do with tank Yasuo.\n\n{{item:3078}} {{item:3022}} {{item:1001}} {{item:3026}} {{item:3068}} {{item:3053}} \n\nThis was his tank build. He did not build a single crit item. It was strong because of two reasons primarily: fervor of battle's flat on-hit damage being incredibly strong at the time, and his ult granting bonus penetration on everything. The build was effectively killed by making his bonus armour penetration apply only to crits, which are what you claim is what caused the build. There's no argument here. You're simply wrong.\n\nHis crit passive forces him to build damage to do damage, not the opposite.\n\n> as well as Yasuo getting &amp;#039;shut down&amp;#039; but unlike Riven he becomes relevant the second laning ends anyway and gets a quadra shortly after. \n\nThis frankly does not happen against good opponents. Against bad opponents Riven can do the same thing, so I'm honestly not sure why you're differentiating between the two here.\n\nYasuo's two item power spike is the most overrated in the game. Sure, he has strong damage due to his PD and IE (a Tryndamere has better damage though ayoooooo). But see, here's the thing: those items combined give a cloth armour in damage reduction. Even with defensive boots you're still very squishy in skirmishes and team fights, so good lockdown and focus still easily kills him. And if Yasuo is actually \"shut down\" he's going to have level disadvantage and be getting those two items when his opponents have like three+ items, and a Yasuo with two items can't get a quadrakill against a team that's ahead of him unless they play very badly. I really don't know where this meme came from. Yasuo is one of the worst champions to play while behind.\n\n> Windwall:\n> From a balance point of view this ability is 100% A-O-K. But this is probably the biggest &amp;#039;anti-fun&amp;#039; middle finger in LoL alongside Tahm stealing an ADC right before you kill them or Lulu&amp;#039;s point and click Polymorph. They are abilities that aren&amp;#039;t even all that fun for the user. \n\nI think it's fun.\n\n>But they make the enemies utterly miserable.\n\nYeah losing isn't very fun.\n\n> The thing is, in most games people would tell you to suck it up and git gud. But Riot caters a lot to the whiners and crybabies. The thing is, that is fine.\n\nI'd strongly disagree tbh. Catering to crybabies who refuse to play around an ability isn't a point in Rito's favor IMO.\n\n>Wind wall has the unfortunate design of Yasuo just throwing it out haphazardly in mid game and without any skill or effort deletes 2 incoming ults in a team fight\n\nThis is still a \"get good\" issue though. Good players don't throw everything at WW. A good Yasuo has to use his WW well against good players. A bad Yasuo doesn't really have to against bad players. I don't see the issue.\n\n> #What would I change about Yasuo?\n> **Nerfed**\n> &amp;bull; Gathering Storm duration reduced to 5 seconds.\n\nMight be too big a nerf but could live with.\n\n> &amp;bull; Sweeping Blade now displays CD indicators for enemies and allies as well.\n\nTbh I used to assume this was the case. I don't know why it isn't.\n\n> **Buffed**\n> &amp;bull; Resolve shield increased to 110 - 600 based on level.\n\nK.\n\n> &amp;bull; Base HP, AD, Armor and Magic resist increased by noticeable amounts.\n\nHorrible idea. None of the reworked changes you proposed weakened his laning phase significantly. This is just a straight buff to his laning power on a champion people already whine about being unfun to lane against, which you apparently think is important. Now he can actually just stat-check people top lane.\n\n> &amp;bull; Steal Tempest base damage increased to 30/60/90/120/150.\n\nDitto.\n\n> **Reworked**\n> Intent: No longer grants double critical strike chance. Instead Yasuo&amp;#039;s basic attacks will now strike for bonus damage based on his critical strike chance and increased by critical strike damage like Ashe&amp;#039;s passive, except no bonus 10% to start with as currently he starts with no benefit from the double crit without crit chance anyway. Instead he will scale slightly harder with the crit. Yasuo&amp;#039;s Q will also benefit including the base damage. \n\nSo you want Yasuo to be forced to build more crit, is that it?\n\nThat would completely gut his scaling, and I'll tell you why.\n\nYou seem to think that Yasuo should build more like ADCs like Ashe or Jinx. But you're not taking into account an important fact: Yasuo is melee.\n\nThis alone makes a HUGE difference. What do you expect Yasuo to be building after PD and IE with your changes?\n\n{{item:3085}} {{item:3094}} Useless on melee.\n\n{{item:3508}} While required for max efficiency, what Yasuo wants to build this? The mana passive is worthless, the CDR is mostly wasted, so you're paying a huge sum of gold for the AD and crit. Awful.\n\n{{item:3087}} Hey this one is actually still kind of usable, but it's still pretty bad. Yas already has okay waveclear, so in all other respects this is just an inferior PD, which you already have. \n\nNone of these items provide any survivability either, and once again, Yasuo is melee. So what, he spends four item slots on almost pure offensive power to get a bit above the damage he used to have, at the expense of the ability to survive team fights at all? Or does he do comparable damage with just two crit items? If so, what was the point of the change?\n\nHere is what Yasuo tends to build these days: {{item:3046}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3047}} {{item:3072}} {{item:3022}} {{item:3026}} \n\nThis is not a particularly tanky build, and it's about to get even squishier with the GA changes (which are frankly a nerf). He still builds mostly damage, but he has to dip into hybrid defense items with one pure tank item to be effective, since he's essentially an ADC that is melee. He can't afford to go YOLO full damage with over two crit items like Caitlyn can, because if he does he is going to die.\n\n> Windwall: Yasuo will create a blast of air in a 180&amp;deg; half circle knocking enemies in melee range back a short distance(does not count as Airborne for his ultimate) dealing 15/30/45/60/75 damage increased by 2% for every 1% of critical strike chance Yasuo has and blocking ALL attacks against him for .75 seconds. After that it will expand out into a wall that will slow projectiles that pass through it by 20/25/30/35/40% and reduce their damage, debuffs and crowd control effects by an equal amount. \n\nWait hold on, so you want this ability to deal damage, knock enemies off of you, block all attacks (like a Darius dunk) briefly, and then still make projectiles mostly useless?\n\n... sure, sounds great, I see no problem with this change at all. {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}} \n\n> Buffs to Resolve, HP, Armor and MR make up some survivability lost in laning and team fighting from the change to windwall as well as lost lifesteal from the removal of double crit. \n\nYour change to wind wall hasn't lowered his survivability at all, especially not top lane, where it can now block melee abilities. \n\n> The Buffs to base AD and Steal Tempest base damage was to try to offset SOME of the lost damage from double crit. All these changes to damage would actually be a slight buff to a 0% crit chance Yasuo in fact. \n\nWhy would you want to buff Yasuo before he's meant to scale...?\n\n> Reworked intent will force Yasuo to actually build damage if he wants damage. \n\nHe already has to build damage if he wants damage though. You're fighting a battle that doesn't exist. Tank Yasuo is dead, you're factually ignorant about his crit being its cause, and short of a big shift in meta, masteries, and itemization it won't be coming back. I appreciate the sincere effort on tackling Yasuo's design, but frankly I think you missed the mark.","replies":[{"poster":"IronwallJackson","date":"2017-04-19T12:59:22.442+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"From one guy who's spent a lot of time thinking about the stuff that makes Yasuo's kit tick to another, well hat's off man, this is a fantastic post.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ChaddyFantome","date":"2017-04-18T23:00:22.982+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"hmmm, interesting.\nI also really like the windwall change.
