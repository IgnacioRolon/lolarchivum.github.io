The LCS is nothing but a precursor to the SoloQ to follow. People bitch when Graves ends up OP for a patch or two but don&#039;t realize that Riot nerfing around the LCS is to prevent just that. Nerfing Support Malz before it becomes too much oppressive cancer, nerfing Vlad before he dominated SoloQ for free last year.\r\n\r\nYes the Malz nerfs were warranted. This is from somebody with 80k mastery on him and 450 Malz games before mastery existed. The rework was a failure and like Azir, Aatrox or Kalista he has to be guttered until fixed. Does it make me sad? Yes. Is it unreasonable? No.\r\n\r\nNow are there special immunity cases of bias? Maybe, but believe it or not Riven is not used in the LCS other than a situational pick in S3-4 and I am pretty sure Yasuo never has been(may be wrong). Lee might see some favoritism we have that one quote people take out of context where they don&#039;t like nerfing him out of meta because he makes for good show. But I ain&#039;t gettin&#039; into that.\r\n\r\nBut no sorry. Riot should always balance around the best players playing the champions in the ideal way with good team cordination, with adjustments for Bronze-Plat only if champions get way out of hand(See Yi last time he was viable). Because no other form of balancing makes sense.\r\n\r\nIf a champion pubstomps low tier soloQ because they are strong in LCS it is fine for a brief period to see if people learn how to beat them. Otherwise it is most likely they are a binary design that is too easy to succeed with when strong in low tier, but require being that strong for high tier. In otherwords rework material.\r\n\r\nFunny how the OP champs from LCS end up plaguing SoloQ a month later and people bitch &quot;It&#039;s been OP for AGES how did you not see when Bergfakerdoublehai picked it!&quot; But then when Riot does the appropriate thing and nips it in the bud before the sheep catch on &quot;OMFG nurf muh champ fur ur money make lcs!?!?!&quot;\r\n\r\nSorry. If something as binary as Malzahar is being oppressively dull in LCS to too large of a success. It will find a way to be oppressive in SoloQ within a month. Deserves nerfs.\r\n\r\nIf you&#039;d rather balance for Bronze-Plat however, brace for the Riven buffs as she performs badly below Diamond.","replies":[{"poster":"Sahn Uzal","date":"2017-04-06T12:57:07.476+0000","up_votes":98,"down_votes":7,"body":"Riot has openly admitted that they do balance around LCS.

But the issue really comes into play when there is a nerf to the portion of a champs kit that is NOT the issue. I think that is the biggest issue that happens when it comes to balance. Riot is on top of whos too strong, albeit sometimes it takes them too long to do something about it. \n\nDon't forget Riot trashing champs and not touching them, destroying the playerbase of a champ for X amount of time (just look at Yorick and Mord). Yes, people will bring up that they did get updates and whatnot, but there are still so many issues with them. If Riot actually followed up with these champs, then I think we would get much fewer salty threads.\n\nI for one wish Riot would actually do something for the _literal hundreds_ of bugs that Mord has but they just continue side stepping him like he doesn't exist. It's extremely upsetting as a player to have the devs not caring about parts of their game that is evolving like it is. \n\nI guess I have to wait another 3+ years for Riot to even touch those two champs and maybe place them in a better spot.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rozzeta","date":"2017-04-06T22:35:40.900+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Half the thing they do in LCS does not work in teams with lack of coordination, like standard Solo Q.\n\nAlso, things like Malz support are not a problem itself, but a symptom of a bigger issue.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Matthew Mathers","date":"2017-04-06T19:34:49.475+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The strength of a champion is very superficial in solo queue especially on western servers.  General mechanics and decision making can enable a \"one trick\" of any champion to reach rank 1.
