And she has always been reliant on actually scaling with items and gold to do her job, meaning she can be shut down.\nI think the reasons are obvious.\n\n**Shitty base damages for somebody dedicated to doing damage.**\nThis means she has to build damage to do damage.\n\n**Extremely high scalings make building AD required.**\nRewarded for building primary damage stat.\n\n**No true damage, %HP or built in pen.**\nMeaning she *must* build pen in order to have pen, consuming another item slot on damaging items.\n\n**Only defensive steroid scales on AD.**\nShe is again rewarded with survivability by building AD discouraging building tank as the shield is worthless otherwise.\n\n**No natural sustain.**\nSo she cannot survive extended fights without AD for her shield and lifesteal.\n\n**Requires a lot of items.**\nUnlike people specifically designed to reach their maximum potential with 1-2 items Riven scales smoothly higher the more items she buys but also requires constantly more damage items or she falls behind.\n\n**Only utility is brief melee range CC.**\nNo massive team heals, no massive AoE CCs. Just a melee range .75s stun and a fairly decent knockup. Unlike some Skirmishers/Assassins she doesn&#039;t have the team utilities to be good as an off tank.\n\nIgnoring the things people dislike about Riven, these things seem like they would be healthy to carry over into other Skirmisher and Assassin designs. There are other design factors to consider as well, but these are the big ones I noticed. She must build AD to have sustain and shielding, she must build AD to do damage, she must build pen to deal with GA/Zonya/Tabi as well as tanks, she doesn&#039;t get %HP pen or true damage tacked onto her kit as &#039;free&#039; extra damage she must build for damage, she has no team utilities, her CC is very mild and melee range, her defensive steroid scales with damage.\n\nRiven has NEVER had a *META* tank build, there is a reason for that. She can actually be shut down and there is a reason for that as well.","replies":[{"poster":"Malicious Metal","date":"2017-05-25T02:18:18.221+0000","up_votes":35,"down_votes":2,"body":"Tl;DR:\n\nRiot, don't give champions you intend to build purely offensive tools that let them get away with building durable as balls.","replies":[{"poster":"Mira Arya Enthe","date":"2017-05-25T02:21:04.120+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":1,"body":"~~Fuck Fiora and Fizz~~\n\nAhem.
