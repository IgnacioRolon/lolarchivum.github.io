Please, before you make stupid comments, please look at your build. I destroy tanks, between healing reduction on every auto, 45%+7% armor pen, bonus damage against high HP targets. Tanks only survive if they get about 4000+HP and at least 250 of each defense. Even then they still die to the ADC or APC or Fighter within about 5 seconds if 1v1.

League of tanks means only tanks are good and everyone else is useless. Supports, assassins and ADCs start to vanish, and mid mages lose their purpose. League of assassins makes ADCs and supports worthless. And only bruisers can stand up to them, even then it's frustrating. League of supports results in these frustrating 'carry bot lane' Annie's. League of Bruisers is okay, but it makes assassins worthless and tanks become second class citizens as bruisers end up just better.\n\nAn ADC focused meta, even if occasionally annoying with tank melting, is the healthiest meta for the most classes.","replies":[{"poster":"Critmaster Garen","date":"2016-08-08T18:41:22.979+0000","up_votes":25,"down_votes":4,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Mira Arya Enthe,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=2VzeXGMJ,comment-id=0000000000010000,timestamp=2016-08-08T18:34:13.719+0000)\n>\n> &quot;League of ADCs&quot; is considered the healthiest meta.\n\nby you and other adc mains.\n\ngenerally ive seen more people favouring towards a tank meta. the game was actually in its most balanced state in years at the end of season 5 when there was no single carry class, but you could carry from every lane as long as you did well early.","replies":[{"poster":"Mira Arya Enthe","date":"2016-08-08T18:49:22.414+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":11,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Critmaster Garen,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=2VzeXGMJ,comment-id=00000000000100000000,timestamp=2016-08-08T18:41:22.979+0000)\n>\n> by you and other adc mains.\n> \n> generally ive seen more people favouring towards a tank meta. the game was actually in its most balanced state in years at the end of season 5 when there was no single carry class, but you could carry from every lane as long as you did well early.\n\nTry checking my mastery dude...

I did like S5 immensely however.\n\nAt the moment: Bruiser/Tank Ekko, Bruiser Akali, AP Sona, Tank Malfite (bursting, tanking and killing is understandable -- but an ult like that  enabling to 100-0 with near 0 counterplay even if you have vision is triggering), tank Vi, and tank Xin (even when a Xin was afk for 7 minutes and 3 levels behind with 2 items less bursted down an ADC quickly while initiating beyond ADC's range -- however Xin is not an inherent problem, just a toxicity issue of damage curve all around). \n\nIt's a little frustrating and the role [marksmen] feels nearly useless this season unless you have good CC/Utility in your kit to provide something to the team because otherwise you sit and twiddle your thumbs to hope to just clear minions and take turrets and not get one/two shot. (i.e. Ashe ult and vision, Jhin W, traps and Ult, Caitlyn traps and safety range, and Sivirs ult + high waveclear.) There's so much damage going around, that ADC is just for the AD siege habit at this point. You don't need to be a late game monster, but there should be some room for outplays on either side during all phases of the game in some individual way to prevent snowballing from being overwhelming and late game from being overly oppressive. Even at S5 when ADC's late game wasn't melting everything in sight, there were mechanics that made you out to be more useful -- kiting, orbwalking, positioning, casting when and who, etc. that changed the flow. It's healthier when they aren't melting everything imo.\n\nPerhaps it's good ADC's are taking a more team oriented role now, even if the state of such is crude at the moment and needs refinement to become less poisonous; however it is certainly not at a point this season where it is healthy or acceptable -- or even to assume that it just a problem for ADC's, but for pure tanks as well who feel nearly useless unless they have incredible teamfight like Maokai and Gnar (technically bruiser, but even full tank is very useful), or are named Rammus.\n\n\n//end rant","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"NineTailedMystic","date":"2016-08-09T00:16:28.615+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">I am not an ADC main\n\n>I main Ashe but I never get to play her because the rework made her so OP.\n\nwot","replies":[{"poster":"Mira Arya Enthe","date":"2016-08-09T15:35:08.850+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=NineTailedMystic,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=2VzeXGMJ,comment-id=0000000000010000000000000001,timestamp=2016-08-09T00:16:28.615+0000)\n>\n> wot\n\nShe is my main, and only ADC.

This is a very very silly thing.\n\nYeah, builds are often too static. For example, the other day I was Leona. Noticed with a corkie ADC doing magic damage, an APC mid, a fid jungle and Garen top. We did not have enough physical damage. So after I got my base support and tank items I bought a titanic hydra. We won and I ended up being a large amount of my team's damage because the enemies built tones of MR and locket. My Titanic Hydra late game was doing 130 bonus to main target, like 200 to secondary targets and the active was around 550.\n\nBuilds should change based on situation.","replies":[{"poster":"Tobias Brackner","date":"2016-08-08T20:03:59.389+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Building dmg on Supports is extremely underrated, especially ones with natural tankiness tools like Leona and Alistar.\n\nBlack Cleaver, Wit's End, Abyssal Scepter, Frozen Mallet, and Iceborn Gauntlet are awesome potential dmg sources for Supports.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"łnśane","date":"2016-08-08T21:06:32.993+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's quite funny seeing people moan and cry over tanks, when you have the items to melt them please people get magic pen or armor pen. {{item:3135}}  < great  item, {{item:3151}}  < gives health and magic pen. {{item:3036}}  {{item:3033}} !!!
