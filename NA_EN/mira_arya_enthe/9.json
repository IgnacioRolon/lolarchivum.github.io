I have no interest in hearing it, using it, having it used or knowing it exists. I&#039;d rather immerse myself in the game and music, and have fun. Playing competitive games with voicecom before it is pure cancer and is NEVER used right. The only people who think it is good at either delusional ones who think anybody was paying attention to the orders they barked or genuinely ignorant people who have never played games with voicecoms. It is all the immaturity of the Internet and shitty personalities pounded into your ear with a 1/100 game benefit that will split communication ruining teamplay further.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/ewmg0uXU2cM\n\n#For those saying what has already been addressed\n\"Mute\" doesn't fix what happens to the now divided communication system voice chat would create. The options are:\n\nA: Deal with cancer.\n\nB: Turn it off and deal with reduced communication as people forget what pings and chat is.\n\nC: Selectively mute 99% of people encountered.\n\nWhereas no voice chat everyone is on an even playing field for communication with pings and chatbar. Things far less toxic where the worst you get is \"?\" Ping or some easily ignored text without breaking game immersion.","replies":[{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2017-03-31T13:37:13.769+0000","up_votes":89,"down_votes":1,"body":"You forgot to include guys who fap or make noises like they are. \n\nIt's happened more than I like to admit.","replies":[{"poster":"Mira Arya Enthe","date":"2017-03-31T13:41:49.968+0000","up_votes":28,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ah yeh...

Because people like me will not use this, and the people who will will completely ignore chat and will rarely use pings and expect us to follow their lead because they're expecting everyone to be in voice coms.
