Also, when I've got 2400 HP as a tank and Garen does 1800+ true damage to me, I wasn't low HP, I got hit by maybe 2 autos from another enemy champ, and maybe took some AoE damage, now I'm dead from a point and click ability that inflicts nearly my entire HP bar in damage. My champion is supposed to sustain through damage in long fights, and I know that burst is a huge counter to sustain, but when there's no way I can itemize against that damage except by building my champion incorrectly (meaning I'm now less effective vs the other 4 enemy champions), or I just have to play a different champion, (which isn't always a choice if I picked before Garen was picked)... \n\nI just want a way to play against it. As a tanky champion with low mobility, I can't kite Garen, and even if I had a champion that is strong at kiting, Garen does have his Q, and his ult has a bit of range. \n\nI don't think these things are overpowered, but it just makes it more or less impossible to build defensively against. I can't pick up a warmog's just because they have a Garen, when two other champs on their team inflict %HP damage, and now I can't build resistances, because one of those %HP damage champions does true damage on top of the true damage that Garen has. \n\nI understand that the point of true damage is for it to be \"true\" damage, but there's rarely effective counterplay besides just killing or cc'ing the other person. Like I said, lifesteal is probably the only true counter to a %hp and true damage mix. You can go with a low HP pool and maybe build an item like Tmail or Banshee's to protect against the %hp damage, and then at the same time you'll sustain through their true damage. (their non true damage isn't effective against you, and you're healing for hopefully more than their true damage). \n\nAlthough, like I said before, when Garen can 80-0 me with the click of a button...
