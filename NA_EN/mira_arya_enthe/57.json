Multiple game mechanic changes, drastically more objective changes, and frequent roster updates make the game so different that it's no surprise there's a lot of issues with this season.\n\nNot only that but this season has been an absolute nightmare up until now, and the fact that it's in a decent spot right now doesn't excuse this.

Comparatively, I don't think we hit that much when you take into account Seasons 3-6. _A majority of league's post launch champions came out in the span of two seasons._\n\nThus, Riot put off the issue of character similarity because who cares, smol company scrambling to get those dollars in quick. Except now, all that has come around to bite them in the ass. The secondary issue is that these were delayed for so long that people grew attached to things, even if they weren't healthy (Much like I am with soda. Honest to god I'm trying to cut back.)\n\nAlmost every problem currently facing League, from champion similarity to items being stat sticks (Thank god we're getting more actives) to code and client, originated from Season 1/2. We only see them now because Riot put it off until it hit the breaking point, much like their grip on the pro scene and concerns with casters.","replies":[{"poster":"Earl Eulrich","date":"2016-10-27T13:26:47.610+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"i really disagree here. the most troubling issues stem from the s5&6 chances, mainly to the vision system and to the massive increase in dmg and snowballing over time. also the addition of way too much mobility and many new problematic mechanics for the sake of uniqueness.

Yeah, there could be a debate on pink wards not revealing stealth, but that's beside the point.\n\nBefore trinkets came around, SO MUCH GOLD would be sunk into just vision. This would slow games down by a fairly drastic amount. Today, however, the only ward you ever spend gold on is the pink ward. All other vision and vision denial is essentially (unless you count buying sightstone). Also, we have vision wars. Before trinkets, you could light up the entire map, and the only thing the other team could do to counter it were to buy pink wards, which only added to overall vision in the field. Now, vision is more like a game of chess, with both teams trying to keep control over vision around big objectives. Could there be a bit more vision (like lowering the CD on yellow trinket)? Possibly. But, it's undeniable that vision is in a very good state right now.\n\nAs for damage, it might be due to the class updates. We've had Juggernauts (which were more of an experiment on Riots end.......some of them ending badly), Marksman, Mages, and now Assassins. Damage may very well stay at an all time high until Riot visits one of the tank classes (I've seen a lot of talk around Vangaurds (tanks with a hell of a lot cc), chances are they'll be next). The new Kings Vow item is just a taste of what's to come. This item alone is sparking speculation on duo bot lane bruisers, and once the Vanfaurd update comes around, chances are we'll see a somewhat dramatic change in how tankiness works.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"AMYS GRAVE","date":"2016-10-27T04:55:05.536+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":5,"body":"> I believe Season 5 was much better handled balance-wise and it was great that it didn't seek to change the game's formula every three weeks.\n\nThis ^ They don't need two full class updates a year.

Most were quickly fixed anyway.\n\nYeah, some games are alright, but the majority of them now are praying that your bot lane doesn't open up a buffet or that your jungle Nidalee or Graves actually knows how to jungle. \n\nYeah, those both had related factors in previous seasons, but they impact the game WAY more than they ever have this season. \n\nNot only that, but almost every champion played now has significant disengage. There's little to no risk on a good portion of new/reworked champions for overextending. This leads to them literally being at your tower harassing you without fear of being punished in a lot of cases. This makes a lot of games infuriatingly one-sided unless your jungler is actually a good player, which doesn't happen nearly often enough. \n\nThrow in the absurd amount of damage in the game now, and it just leads to a completely one-sided experience in the majority of games. \n\nOne-sided games aren't all that fun, whether you're on the winning side or losing side.","replies":[]},{"poster":"jaymc1130","date":"2016-10-27T02:06:32.703+0000","up_votes":38,"down_votes":11,"body":"League has been in the worst state its ever been in this season.\n\nThe amount of diversity in terms of strategy is simply nonexistent. The only viable strategy this entire season has been \"snowball hard in the first 10 and auto win\". Nothing else has been viable competitively on the ladder. 1-3-1's died with the TP nerfs and the rise of Ghost being taken by midlaners, stall comps and turtle comps cant compete, the average game time decreased by more than 10% this season, competitive integrity on the ladder was completely done away with, the quality of ranked matches has been awful all season thanks in large part to DQ allowing a more than tripled rate of the average MMR distance between highest and lowest ranked player on a team going from an average separation of 100 MMR (about 2 divisions) to over 300 MMR (an entire tier), the client is finally SOOO buggy that it HAS to be redone because every 5th lobby causes the client to crash, the hextech crafting tab always causes the client to crash, every champion has the ability to lead his team in dmg dealt to enemy champs because of the Keystone additions which has partly helped lead to the snowball meta and the brief overly strong tank meta where {{item:3025}} {{item:3068}} basically made you unkillable really early in games while simultaneously giving you fighter-assassin level damage as a tank, nearly 20 % of the playerbase has decided to quit the game which has lead to longer queue times even for normal blind pick matches and can be easily seen in the fact that the total number of players to play ranked this season on most servers is down by about 20% (less than 2 million on the NA server for the first time since season 3 I think? A bit over half a million players less than last season), but the number of players in d5 and up has increased by more than 50% (about 25,000 total last season, about 22,000 the prior season, over 36,000 to date this season) confirming that boosting has been more prevalent than ever.\n\nThe game's in pretty bad shape mate.","replies":[{"poster":"Sevixys","date":"2016-10-27T07:22:16.608+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Where do you get these numbers?

They are not public information\n\nVarious websites, not all of it is easy to find or access and I've got a boat load of data stored in my memory so some things I'm pulling straight from prior seasons of data that was available then and may not be available now without some real digging.\n\nAbout the only thing you can't use is any of Riot's data since its all manipulated to spin things. Like that 100 million player bullshit they posted a while back. Lol, yeah right. I'm 16 players by myself because I play 16 accounts regularly, we all know that number is massively inflated by smurfs. Most of the usable information you can find with just google searches if you feel the need to dig through things.\n\nSome things you will simply have to extrapolate based on other data, for example, the length of my average normal blind pick queue time. It's increased roughly 20-25% this season compared to what it was in last December. I've regularly had 20 minute blind pick waits on some smurfs because of their normal MMR being well over 2000. Even in those circumstances a year ago I never had to wait more than about 5 minutes on average for a match.\n\nNormal blind pick wait times can only increase because of one thing: less players playing the mode. Now if we knew that there were more players playing ranked we could surmise that because they are playing ranked (or any other game mode really) there are less players playing blind pick. But we know some of these things aren't the case, for example we know there are LESS players playing ranked this season than in prior seasons (this being data you can acquire in a straightforward way) and there are less playing in other game modes as well because some of them have been removed, or other various reasons. Naturally this should mean we see an influx of players for blind pick normals and queue times would decrease over the season. Instead they have progressively gotten longer on average each month for the past 10 and a half months to the point where they are now roughly 20-25% longer on average. From this we can extrapolate that there are less players in total playing the game mode, and since this is the most played game mode we can also assume this means there are less players playing in general. Probably by about 20%.\n\nSo some of this info is directly pulled, some of it is archived data, and some of it is just common sense extrapolation.","replies":[{"poster":"Glory ln Death","date":"2016-10-27T18:58:19.933+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would argue that you are leaving out the implementation of the new champion select in the Normal Draft mode.

I know you are the \"oh everythings not that bad man\" average player but from a hardcore player perspective the game has been shit for a very long time and def going down hill. There have been so many players being boosted so that they dont have to play this season.

They are snowball-y to the point where there is almost no coming back from an early disadvantage, and even though you know the outcome at 10 min, there's still another 30 min of boredom before the inevitable winner can end it. The game has never had so little back and forth..it's all one way traffic.  Teamwork has never mattered so little..the game is starting to feel like a bad version of DoTA.\n\nAlso, I seriously think the math for AD is broken as most phys. damage characters can 100% you in one combo and knock down turrets in 5 seconds, while building armor doesn't seem to mitigate the damage at all.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Critmaster Garen","date":"2016-10-27T05:09:57.338+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"its also not in the best state ever.\n\nthe best state was at the end of season 5, after juggernauts were balanced out and the initial overtuned releases were nerfed into a state were they were decent, but not weak. the only class that was generally lacking a bit at the time were mages. but even then, certain mages were played effectively. every class was equally relevant.\n\nat worst it was a couple individual champions being slightly too weak or in need of reworks.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KVbqbFsC8e","date":"2016-10-27T03:17:50.186+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"Dynamic que was the worst thing to ever happen to League.
