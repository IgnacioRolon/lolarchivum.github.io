(Which they hit this thematic perfectly in the rework) but other than that Poppy really struggled to have a feel other than that. Her kit was too lop-sided( dis-arranged, is that the word?) kinda like a puzzle but with nothing but pieces that dont fit together.

She could just pick \"Innocent Squishy 1\", nullify the rest of their team, and slam them into a wall and kill them instantly. Her passive was also quite interesting in how it worked but still was confusing to me at least. Her kit lacked power, which made her pretty weak and nearly impossible to get through laning phase with. It was obvious she was just too weak until given time to use her ult. Her lore was great too as it set up another champion connection + her VA wasnt too bad for an old champ, but it was just she didnt work. Her new Q is way better, her new passive makes her actually able to do something in lane + have some sort of survivability, her e didnt change but overall works more cohesively with her new kit, and her new ult can either be used in solo targeting or saving your team (or the rare \"kill secure\")\n\nEdit: WHOOPS MISSED THE POINT\nIn the end, I feel her rework actually established who she is as a character, and delivered a better feel of who she was in gameplay, without making her feel drastically different from old poppy.

They tried to hard and in the end created a new champion.\n\nRight now he is balanced around his best case scenario - a possibility to 5-man ult, 5-man stun, 5-man heal - that makes him feel extremally dull and boring. \nHe lost his theme - look at his splash and tell me you see a paladin there - he is one big mess of stars, beauty, protector, mountain, demigod, gems, cleric and Fabio, bc wandering gem knight was not unique enough.\nHe lost the warmth in his voice - now is all about \"Me\" and \"I\":\n\"That glimmer of hope you see, that's me.\"\n\"I climbed Mount Targon. You suck.\"\n\"The stars were the question. I was the answer.\"\nWhy is he even scaling with armor if he wears none?\n\nAll in all i have to agree with him - \"Im no longer the man i once was.\" :(","replies":[{"poster":"Shadragon","date":"2016-10-16T15:49:31.932+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The new Taric could be a pretty solid champion if they just removed his heal and gave him a real Q.\nHe'd be even better if they removed his stupid ult and gave him something actually fun to use. Even his old ult was more interesting than this garbage.\n\nHonestly though he would be better served if they just reverted him to before he got gutted in pre-season 3, which only happened because his pick rate was unusually high in the pro play meta more than 6 months prior. He wasn't even a meta pick anymore when the nerfs hit, and he was only meta in the first place because he was the only thing that could compete with Sona at the time. Taric received the singlemost crippling nerf in any patch in the history of the game, just because. He was strong, but not overpowered, he saw his fair share of play but wasn't overpopular. He was as close to perfectly balanced as any single champion could get, and the item changes were already weakening him while buffing some of his competition.\nPeople always bring up Olaf or Evelynn when talking about overzealous nerfs that permanently ruin a champion, but in a single patch nobody has ever received numerical nerfs harsher than Taric has, no one has ever received as many nerfs to different parts of their kit as Taric has, and nobody has ever been nerfed with less justification than Taric has. And the most frustrating part is that nobody even remembers it. Nobody raised a fuss about the change. Nobody noticed that Taric suddenly just stopped existing. The whole event was just ignored and forgotten.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SwiftKitten88","date":"2016-10-15T02:29:14.220+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"then we have{{champion:76}}  who riot managed to gut for every elos below plat and yet still have her stupid OP in diamond+.\n\nat least of you {{champion:268}}  and {{champion:429}}  mains, people feel bad for you..\n\nmy main {{champion:76}} has been gutted in my elo and people still hate it and cry for nerfs because it somehow manages to still be crazy strong in higher elo.\n\nand completely ignore the fact that that the only reason i can even PLAY nidalee viably in my elo is the fact that since the day i start playing in season 3 she has been my main.","replies":[{"poster":"Mira Arya Enthe","date":"2016-10-15T02:30:43.872+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nononono!
