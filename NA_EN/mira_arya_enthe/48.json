But what kind of epic feeling and gameplay are Juggernauts, Tanks, ADCs, Supports, etc going to have in comparison to all this epic parkour stuff, intricate blinking finesse and crud? I mean, most Juggernauts don&#039;t even feel &#039;powerful&#039; in exchange, most tanks don&#039;t feel like a &#039;steel wall&#039;, most marksman don't really feel like high skilled, finesse filled ranged fighters or blasting cannons in the way they should.\n\nPerhaps this can be fixed merely with visual and sound updates. But to me, it feels like most of the reworked assassins will really be living up to their fantasy now. While other class/champion updates have been okay... but mostly were just some mild gameplay updates and balance. They didn&#039;t really make their fantasy feel more epic and impactful like with the assassin update.\n\nLike, we need Juggernauts to actually feel like somebody who is coming to march up to you in an intimidating manner and wipe the floor with foes through mighty blows.\n\nWe need tanks to feel like they are going to crash into you and tie you all down.\n\nAshe needs to feel like fucking ice Legolas! Not a slow moving machine gun with a stun who serves the role of DPS for her team.\n\nOnly some of these champions feel kinda like this. While the assassins, especially Kat and Talon, are amazing now.\n\nAll the other updates? They feel like they were done merely for balance and gameplay sake. Very few of them really expanded on champion fantasies.

Wtf?\n\nAs for Poppy, yeah, there wasn't much counterplay to her ult, but there are a LOT of things that are poorly designed by Riot. Even now. Also, they made her more of a tank than a fighter, and I'm pretty sure she was supposed to be fighter.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2016-10-20T11:03:29.052+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But they became great tanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Wind Whistler","date":"2016-10-21T04:34:57.043+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ralanr,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Ek9Eet0j,comment-id=00000000000000000000,timestamp=2016-10-20T11:03:29.052+0000)\n>\n> But they became great tanks.\n\nI suppose...
