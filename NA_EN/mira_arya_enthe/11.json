For the love of god us bruisers, skirmishers, assassins, tanks, supports and so forth typically have almost no wave-clear or have to be in melee range for it. If it is 5v5 mid and one slip-up = enemy team diving and blasting our team to high heavens. The last thing I want is for our Sejauni or Riven to be trying to walk out into the enemy minions and clear them from melee range, when you can do so from 500-1100 range.
