It is not okay to go around using terms like cancer, kys, or even &quot;you are retarded&quot;\r\n\r\nBut as long as it is the community, especially if they play support, targeting players of a certain class or champion. Oh then it is fine.\r\n\r\nLike why is it okay to selectively insult ADC players and create presumptive nearly &#039;racist&#039; style stereotypes out of everyone who plays them often quite insulting, in serious none joke threads. Or why is it not bannable to say things like &quot;Why every Yasuo player is a fucking asshole&quot; in a serious tone? Mind you I hate playing against Yas. But as if every person who picks up that champion deserves that treatment wow.\r\n\r\nThere can be threads talking down anybody who likes carry champions like they are some sort of second coming of hitler. That is ridiculous.\r\n\r\nLike I get it. Certain champions annoy you or a certain class you may not like fighting or playing with. But sorry, this game isn&#039;t yours. It is everyone&#039;s, mostly Riot&#039;s. And treating people who like other characters or classes like trash should be completely unacceptable. Yes, even if you main support.","replies":[{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-01-08T03:14:02.114+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Stereotypes are hollow, but they don't come out of nowhere. From my experience Yasuo players are the most likely to do assholeish stuff like spamming mastery emotes after collapsing 5v1 on a Soraka. After a while it's hard not to associate the champion with that kind of behavior.","replies":[{"poster":"Mira Arya Enthe","date":"2017-01-08T04:53:10.920+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"There are also such things as selective bias and confirmation bias. Because I see more than enough Vlad's, Lux's and Nami's spamming mastery emotes in assholeish ways. I see more than enough raging Fiora's and Leona's. Because I am not specifically, mentally filtering for the exact thing I am looking for. I have also seen plenty of humble, apologetic and polite people on ADC, Yasuo, Riven or Assassins.","replies":[{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-01-08T05:39:59.643+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Like I said, they don't come out of nowhere. There's a reason the players of those champions are targets of that kind of stereotyping, and the very fact that they are (and not Nami's or Leona's) is proof that there are more people that fit the stereotype playing them than playing Nami etc. It doesn't rely on selective bias, if Nami players were as often assholes as Yasuo players than the stereotype would be on Nami in the first place, not Yasuo.","replies":[{"poster":"Mira Arya Enthe","date":"2017-01-08T05:42:06.883+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias","replies":[{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-01-08T05:51:03.753+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/special:random","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"dominusx","date":"2017-01-07T23:57:15.219+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"i trash talk adc players all the time i havent actually told anyone to kys since september but if i didnt care about my acc i would.all adc players are toxic assholes who think they are tje best reality check bud all you do is rightclick","replies":[{"poster":"Mira Arya Enthe","date":"2017-01-08T01:17:19.593+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"I can oversimplify too!\n\nAll juggernauts do is walk at you cycling buttons.\nAll supports do is spam heal.\nAll assassins do is mash buttons and hope they kill.\nAll skirmishers do is memorize combos.\n\nAnyway.

If I get an Asshole Demoralizing Carry (adc) who starts telling me \"I am too good, I dont need any support\" after they flame ME for THEM running in and getting themselves killed, I am happy to walk off and \"support\" the rest of the team. \nOften Immediately after I let the \"super pro\" adc have the lane to themselves, not weighed down by a \"trash/useless\" adc, I watch them die instantly and spam \"report my support for leaving lane, trolling\"\n\nand I laugh. I thought they said they were pro, that they didnt need any useless support. And now they want to report me after i give them what they want?. \n\nAs for the \"brainless soraka/janna\" I am actually Mastery 6 with Soraka, I land most of my skillshots with her (Q/E).
