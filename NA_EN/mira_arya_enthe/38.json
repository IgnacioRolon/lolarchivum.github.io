Singed mains play by very different rules.  Make sure you understand what those rules are before you blame us for things.  Our job is to distract the enemy team and waste as much of their time as is possible.  Your job while a singed is on your team is to pretend top lane doesn't exist and to take something every time 4 people spend a minute chasing us.\n\nSome examples of things people should do while their singed is being chased in circles top:\n\n-Eat the entire bot side jungle\n-push minions into the tower so that the enemy laner who roams loses more gold in minions than they get for using their ult to kill an 0/5 singed.  (It just takes one wave.  Seriously.  Not hard.)\n-take towers of enemy laners who roam.\n-take a dragon every time the enemy jungler has to recall because they chased singed.  Whether or not they get the kill they will be recalling.\n-junglers can gank mid and not with no fear of counter ganks when the enemy jungler is chasing singed.\n\nWhat do people on my team usually do while 4 people on the enemy team chase me and waste all their ults and summoners for a worthless kill?\n\n-flame me in chat while standing still and wasting time.\n-say, \"gg s@20\"\n-freeze the enemy minion wave in fromt of their tower and CS poorly.\n-spam pings on top of me and not CS at all.\n-roam top to try and, \"help,\" me and feed kills that are actually worth gold.\n-junglers take their own wraiths and pretend nothing is happening.\n\nHope this helps you understand how to play (and win) with us on your team.","replies":[{"poster":"Raiku Kawisa","date":"2016-10-26T21:49:47.561+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am a jungler who puts a high priority on dragon.
