Still, he's the oldest champion without a new skin since his release and his long delayed Upgrade is the reason why.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Teddie","date":"2014-09-15T17:21:00.318+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love the splash art for under-taker, but it looks nothing like it in game!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Blue3345","date":"2014-09-15T11:21:18.140+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why is Yorick's ult so buggy?
