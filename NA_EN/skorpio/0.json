Originally she had league on it but couldn't patch. When she tried to reinstall she continuously gets a \"dll error unable to run\". One of the DLLs cannot be run. We have tried running as administrator, uninstalling and removing all league files, and updated her DirectX. Can anyone think of anything to help get league installed? I'm running out of ideas.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-21T00:48:28.862+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll need a screenshot of the error to specifically know what's going on.
