It&#039;ll stay on one person choosing until it counts down to 0 and then it will never update. It basically forces me to dodge despite the fact that I can still write in the chat.\n\nI&#039;ve recently lost 15 lp from dodges just because the client doesn&#039;t update to let me choose my champion. It&#039;s very annoying and I will be rolling back to the legacy client until this is addressed or fixed. I don&#039;t want to queue into a game with a 50% chance of dodging because the client decides to freeze before I can select my champion.","replies":[{"poster":"FiFaOwnage","date":"2017-03-23T14:42:28.885+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had this 6times in 24hours, that's a 60LP loss and each time 30min waiting, I'm so fcking tiled","replies":[{"poster":"FiFaOwnage","date":"2017-03-23T14:43:51.755+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=FiFaOwnage,realm=EUW,application-id=2E4zVIwd,discussion-id=hnWxxdNi,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2017-03-23T14:42:28.885+0000)\n>\n> I had this 6times in 24hours, that&#x27;s a 60LP loss and each time 30min waiting, I&#x27;m so fcking tiled\n\nYou ask to try \"enable it\", to lose another 10LP?

Was very frustrated and didn't help with my mentality for the upcoming game. I understand it's a new client and bugs and all, blah blah... but I shouldn't be punished with dodge times and LP loss for trying to help make your new client better instead of just using the old one like everyone else.  Sorry about the 15 LP lose, bro, I feel your pain.","replies":[]}]}
