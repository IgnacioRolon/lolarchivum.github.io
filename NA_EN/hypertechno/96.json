Riots Hearthstone inspired OCG (Online Card Game) will perform better than Riots FPS. To the simple reason, Riot advertised the FPS too quick. This hype will subside before the beta release, a much-needed hype required if Riot wishes to have a chance with the current FPS's that are popular. \r\n\r\nRiots FPS is competing against an FPS similar to Blizzards Overwatch. Blizzard will see Riot and take the challenge, and mockingly, thanks to the early advertising. Riot is new to the FPS market, the marketing team not taking advantage of that lost Riot any competition. Players will look at Riots market history and make FPS comparisons, all avoided if there was hype. If Riot released a good FPS almost ready for a full release, then advertised it, and encourages streamers to playtest it, they would have created massive hype that would drown competition because it was out of nowhere.\r\n\r\nBecause we all know the game is coming, and Blizzard or any FPS companies most certainly do. Riots FPS will be drowned out of existence unless they get dummy lucky. The FPS is doomed to fail, because of terrible market choices.\r\n\r\nEverything in this Discussion is made from speculation, take what you read as you see fit. If you disbelieve and believe it would be a success, please, comment on details on how, and why, it would succeed.","replies":[]}
