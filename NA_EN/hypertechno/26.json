Or part of the Baccai, rather.\n\nAatrox is beast-like. He's not human. He's a Darkin. He's far larger than the average human, and has (aside from a clear otherwordly face) more strength, speed, and faster reflexes than the best soldier.","replies":[{"poster":"Stars Shaper","date":"2018-02-01T17:14:06.141+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Xerath isn't a Baccai, his Ascension wasn't deserved but he completed that.\n\nDarkins are humanoids, not beast-humans like Vastaya.","replies":[{"poster":"ZedUsanGovos","date":"2018-02-01T20:56:49.425+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Stars Shaper,realm=EUW,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=MpKxlb6o,comment-id=000100000000000000000000,timestamp=2018-02-01T17:14:06.141+0000)\n>\n> Xerath isn&#x27;t a Baccai, his Ascension wasn&#x27;t deserved but he completed that.\n> \n> Darkins are humanoids, not beast-humans like Vastaya.\n\nFair point on Xerath. I was misinformed. But that doesn't change the fact that he doesn't fit into any of the other branches except Program, which was created AFTER he got BCast.\n\nThe Darkin themselves have another form we have yet to see. Rhaast, Aatrox, and Varus all have humanoid bodies because they've inhabited them. Well, Rhaast might inhabit Kayn's. Who knows. Aside from him, we don't know what their true forms are, and even in these humanoid bodies, the fact of the matter is that he has enhanced that body beyond any form eligible for any other tech-skinline at the time. Match the swolest person you could find against Aatrox and Aatrox would tower over that guy.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Sukishoo","date":"2018-02-01T15:38:17.843+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Battlecast is exclusive to Void-based or other kinds of beasts.\n\nSorry but Xerath, Urgot and soon Illaoi say otherwise.\n\n> Mecha is exclusive to beast-like creatures\n\nAatrox is not a Beast-like creature _-_","replies":[{"poster":"ZedUsanGovos","date":"2018-02-01T16:52:15.643+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Sukishoo,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=MpKxlb6o,comment-id=0001000000000001,timestamp=2018-02-01T15:38:17.843+0000)\n>\n> Sorry but Xerath, Urgot and soon Illaoi say otherwise.\n> \n> Aatrox is not a Beast-like creature _-_\n\nLet me rephrase. By other kinds of beasts, I mean other kinds of creatures in general. Illaoi herself isn't a full Battlecast. She's a partial Battlecast, and doesn't count. She's part of the same line, just not an actual Battlecast-- very much like Creator Viktor. Xerath isn't a human, and would even fit perfectly in Program, but he is another creature-- the Baccai. I think that's how it's spelled.\n\nAatrox is a beast-like creature. His stature stands well over the average human, not to mention his appearance. He's a Darkin, and Darkins are not human or Void-related (as far as we know-- this could change in the future).","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Rester","date":"2018-02-01T00:05:27.640+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Considering Quinn has a lack of creative skins (Except for Phoenix) I love this one.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Storn Saroe","date":"2018-02-03T11:29:50.407+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am a big fan of Quinn, and I do think it would be nice for her to get a 1350+ skin. Changing Valor to a Dragon is a decent idea that is thrown around a lot but my major qualm is the name. Please do not call it 'Dragon Trainer', maybe use Dragon Rider or something similar instead. Quinn does not train Valor, Valor saved Quinn and since then they have always been equals. It is a little nitpicky but it is a pet peeve of mine how much Valor gets ignored. Beyond that the idea is solid.","replies":[]}]}
