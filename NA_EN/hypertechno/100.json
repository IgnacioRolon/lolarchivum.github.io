I understand that Zoe is frustrating to play against, but beating her with a huge cooldown increase and slow nerf on her E is way much. Never the less confusing, she barely one-shots, and is countered rather hard at the moment. Honestly, I was thinking of a nerf that would not decimate her, but could not find any real solution.\r\n\r\nI was also looking around the Board and Reddit to find any fuss about Zoe. None, most are from two years ago and some are from early Season 8.\r\n\r\nIt comes to me as rather odd, since her WR is 47% while having a Pr of 7%. While only sitting at a low 15% Br, not even a 20% with how her kit work.\r\n\r\nWhile champions like Zed, Vladimir, Ahri, Fizz, and Malzahar have nice numbers on their Wr and Pr, some with high Brâ€™s. Trumping Zoe in most numbers.\r\n\r\nEven in my elo, Zoe is not a problem, she has a 46% Wr, a 4% Pr, and with a low Br of 4%.\r\n\r\nIf this nerf should go through you must buff other places of her kit.\r\n\r\nBeat me on the head that I am a Zoe main, but I will rather have her playable that strong. This will make her unplayable to even the most experienced Zoe player.\r\n\r\nThe only places she is mighty is EUW, barely scraping the 50% mark. Will KR and NA of all places have her at a low under the 50% mark. Her pick rate and Wr is not even strong in the LCS with only 6% Pr and 48% Wr.\r\n\r\nThere is no reason or good justification for Zoe's nerf. Who is doing this? Leave this poor girl alone Riot, for just one... damn... season. There is no fuzz, no limited counterplay, no low skill ceiling, no perma-one-shot combos, no strong wave clear, and no super high numbers. WHY, Zoe? Out every champion, that has more fuzz and better numbers, Zoe for some odd reason should be given a red light for some OP reason. WHAT THE FUCK, IS THIS REASON?\r\n\r\nI understand that she is frustrating to play against, but since her Br is still this low, people must be ok with her.\r\n\r\nGod I love this company.","replies":[]}
