U.S. EEOC says so.","subforum":"General Discussion","up_votes":7,"down_votes":8,"body":"Bye Riot, no not as I&#039;m leaving the game, I already did that. Here: https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/general-discussion/MOzEdnVJ-my-biased-farewell\n\nI&#039;m not going to sue, but Riot, I&#039;m bringing it up to tell you. No matter if it was for good intentions or not, you did something illegal, and people have the right to sue you and can win with ease.\n\nHere&#039;s the thing, I will make this as reasonable and simple as possible. I never wanted LoL to die, nor make matters worse. But Riot, the way your behaving, and dealing with the situation is not acceptable. What you did, and how your employees handle it, was indeed illegal, according to the U.S. Code Title 42, Chapter 21 - Civil Rights.\n\nThe official, U.S. EEOC can prove it to:\nhttps://www.eeoc.gov/laws/practices/index.cfm\n\nIf a player wanted to sue you and win, this is how they will present it. Since you are a company, that has its HQ in the U.S. Your contract with Tencent won&#039;t be able to save you either, since Politicians in China think that Social Justice is irrelevant. So if it does go to China, it&#039;s still a loss. Riot&#039;s poor decision making, advertisement, and actions have not only included in reputation damage but illegal practice. If people don&#039;t sue now, the future will still have this Pax Convention as a weak spot if it ever happens again.\n\nPlz, Riot, I know you had good intentions. I stayed silent and posted only two funny memes. But come on, Riot is in deep shit right now. It&#039;s only an apology, swallow your pride, get DZK fired, and other people who acted under illegal practice too. It will fix your reputation, by quite a lot, I have never seen such a loyal fan base before. They all knew the Pax convention was intended to be good, but again poor advertising. Swallow your pride, and get out there.","replies":[]}
