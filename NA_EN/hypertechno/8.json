His shield negates all damage and spells. His Ult stuns and hurts like a bitch, his Q can silence, and he has a way to strong of a wave clear with his two other abilities. Even Kat, Ryse, Quinn, Kar, Syndar, Ziggs, and Kas has a hard time defeating this mage. I am most surprised by Kas and Quinn having a hard time against him. \r\nLowering his numbers would do him some good because I have had too many Mal mains BMing because they can dominate my team, even when I am fed and tryharding.\r\nI have only won my games because I was completely tryharding the shit out of the games. I want to have fun in draft games and not have to try hard to make the game fair for me and my team. I am also seeing Mal players to frequently because of SSG winning in the worlds. Plz Riot, just nerf him to the ground for a while so he can drop in popularity, then give him a small buff to get him back in meta so he is somewhat reliable again. Right now I am seeing him too often and he always does the most damage even when far behind.","replies":[{"poster":"Rainfall","date":"2017-11-12T18:55:01.316+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"its not that malzahar is that strong its just that most mages right now are garbage,even ahri and leblanc who were once solid picks are now rushing gunblade.","replies":[{"poster":"Eedat","date":"2017-11-12T19:38:35.368+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mages are actually 100% fine.
