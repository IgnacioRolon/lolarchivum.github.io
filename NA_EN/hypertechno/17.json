I love playing a 30 minute League of Legends game. What I don&#039;t like is how hard it is to make a comeback now. Back in season 7, where I was improving, I could fuck a little bit around in Lol with a full damage Quinn top, in a ranked game without causing too much trouble for the team.\r\nNow, I can&#039;t do that. If I don&#039;t play like the pro players, I will lose the game. I hate the fact that I can&#039;t go full damage Zoe anymore to blow up a moron or two because I will be too squishy to do so. I have to build a banshee or an hourglass.\r\nThe thing that hits me the most, the domino effect League now has. If one of my teammates lost to there opponent, everything is lost, I can&#039;t save the game. I don&#039;t like to hard stump, nor do I like to be the hard stomped. I want the best possible balance between the teams to win, no matter if they are winning or losing.\r\nLeague can be a slow game, but it can&#039;t come with the fast game style gameplay, like Battlerite. Make it so that if one teammate strategies well he can solo win the game.\r\n\r\nStop this ridiculous domino effect. It&#039;s League of Legends, not Battlerite. League should be a slow paced, but, an extremely fun experience for everyone. Make normal League feel like URF, but slow paced.\r\n\r\nBricky kinda feels the same.\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7fXceg5F2I\r\n\r\nMake the game fun and competitive.","replies":[{"poster":"ZaneShadow","date":"2018-03-29T04:17:14.966+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I watch bricky a lot.  \"1 man can lose you the game, 1 man cannot win the game\"  is his main issue, and mixes of short laning phases, excessive jungle ganks, and general burnout he's experiencing with a couple of games right now.  also night blu3 posted on his 1 youtube video a week scheduel and I still see him streaming league when I'm on twitch, so....\n\nIf your leaving league, I wish you a sweet fairwell.  But please dont think that the success of Fortnite means league is dying.  It just means streamers/youtubers looking after their carrears are going to a game that isn't as competitive at the moment for views (so long as ninjas not on) and has a large, easy to access viewership.  It's a money thing far more than it is a gameplay thing.  There may be a few legitimate issues like short laning phases that many high elo players point out, but thats a far cry (5, lol) from a game suddenly dying.","replies":[{"poster":"KnightsKemplar","date":"2018-03-29T15:40:28.136+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good, thoughtful response.\n\nIt's not the first time League has had some pretty big issues, and it won't be the last, I'd wager.

My title was meant to be an overaction, but my main post was to give up the issues **\"I think\"** League has. Right now.\n\nI have some ideas to fix this problem.\n\nMake URF available as a permanent game mode, for those who love fast-paced games. With Blind, Draft, and Ranked.\n\n(I will not be the person playing that game mode, I hate URF.) I really think this would be the way to go. There is a game mode for everyone. If they went that way. Casual League the game mode that lasts for 30 to 45 min and is strategy based game mode. Then Fast League that last for 15 to 30 min and is more of a chaotic game mode. Both game modes can be played for fun and for competitive.\n\nLeague is at the stage where they are turning a slow game into to fast game. Casual League is meant to be, slow and strategic. While URF is supposed to be, fast and a cluster fuck of \"Just keep going in\".\n\nI took two YouTubers with two different ideas. Bricky is the long game style player, while the other being the fast game style player. My intention was to say, \"Hey Riot, make slow League, and fast League. It will solve a lot.\"","replies":[{"poster":"KnightsKemplar","date":"2018-03-29T17:04:55.116+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Many, many people have suggested this before, and there's a very good reason Riot hasn't done it. \n\nBalance in URF is a nightmare. You cannot have a seriously competitive ladder with a system like URF. It's intentionally unbalanced. \n\nEven if you tone it back and have the hallmarks of the URF game mode, you're still dealing with balancing what will become basically two different games. That's simply not a good option, for several reasons, but the biggest is that champs need to be recognizable across modes for that to be effective. They wouldn't be able to balance most champs across multiple game modes effectively; that's why dominion is gone. I don't look at stats for TT, but there's a reason that it's basically a smaller scale Summoner's Rift.\n\nRiot doesn't need the *same* people to stick around to keep this game afloat. People will get tired of it and cycle out, others will see it for the first time and cycle in.\n\nThe biggest thing about this conversation is that *one person quitting isn't even a problem from Riot's perspective.* Their entire business model, from the beginning, was that they didn't want to compromise on quality standards for the sake of mass appeal. If they ever started doing *that*, I think it would be a much bigger problem and the game would actually start dying. The ability of Riot to thoughtfully consider feedback, on a slow timescale, is actually their biggest strength. When they start making kneejerk reactions to perceived problems, *then* I'll know that there's a deeper issue. While they are still confident that they have the right direction and are making logical steps to improve the game, I'm not the least bit worried.","replies":[{"poster":"HyperTechno","date":"2018-03-29T18:12:18.326+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=KempyreanPirate,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ibhnY2rO,comment-id=0003000000000000,timestamp=2018-03-29T17:04:55.116+0000)\n>\n> Many, many people have suggested this before, and there&#x27;s a very good reason Riot hasn&#x27;t done it. \n> \n> Balance in URF is a nightmare.

The URF idea is good in short term, but won't work thanks to all the unnecessary problems they could face in the future. \n\nI know, but it's not much about them when I wrote this post, as it is for the fun aspect of the game. If there is any LolTuber I agree with, it would be Bricky. He strictly goes into what made him unattached to the game. He doesn't think the game is dying, he doesn't think Riot is doing bad, he thinks Riot is improving but is forgetting the part that made Lol fun. Bricky and I are quite alike when it comes to what we think is fun. Riot is not required to change just because of me and Bricky, thinks the game is getting unattractive.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"DNFVixen","date":"2018-03-29T05:27:36.585+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I quit league due to the snowball bullshit, season 6 onward has gotten worse every season, games are fucking way to quick, leathality was a fucking mistake, the new runes where a mistake, BE was a mistake.
