They could team up with Relic Entertainment, who already has experience making such games. (or not.)\r\nBut given how much people want to see the world of Runeterra, the cultures, the people, and maybe even their favorite champions in war. This is a perfect game style.\r\n\r\nSorry, but I do not know what those types of games are called, I know it is not a MOBA.","replies":[]}
