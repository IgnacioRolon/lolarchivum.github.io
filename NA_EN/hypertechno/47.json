The game has gotten better, but they should focus on the fun aspect of the game a little more often. Understandable and I&#039;m pretty sure, Riot is seeing peoples wishes and is on their workbench to figure something out.\nBut they can&#039;t develop if you do not come with reasons and helpful criticism. How do you expect them to fix it if you don&#039;t give them something to fix?\nAll in all, you should not be taken seriously. You can stop playing the game, and you have full right to do so. But don&#039;t go out your way to try to smear a company who is trying their best.\nRiot is not EA, Ubisoft, Blizard, or any other company other than Riot games. Their game is free to play and there are no monthly subscriptions, like, World of WarCraft. Total rip off your money if you ask me. Riot is not like steam trying to make you pay 5 dollars to get access to all there features. Riot is not like Ubisoft, PlayStation, and X-box who wants you to pay a monthly fee for their subscription, to get access to multiplayer. Riot is the most honest, free, and understanding company, out of all of the others I have listed.\nI do not know where NB is getting this attitude from but it needs to stop.\nDon&#039;t get me wrong NB, your probably a nice guy. But you need to shut the fuck up about shit you know little to no shit about. \n\nAnyway, thanks for your time and eyes, I hope, this didn&#039;t tricker too many NB fans.

League of Legends has improved significantly, however, is forgetting the fun aspect of the game.\nOut of most MOBA games, Riot is probably the most honest, free, and understanding company.
