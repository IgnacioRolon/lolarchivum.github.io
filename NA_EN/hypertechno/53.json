I have had many games, where I or another player got our wanted picks ban by a teammate just because they do not like the champion or they just want to be a, you know what I mean.\r\n\r\nThis is mostly annoying, but it can become a problem when the game start. Luckily I can stand it to a small degree. So I would not tilt in the game. But there are people who will tilt.\r\n\r\nSo I was just wondering if Riot is noticing this and would fix it because I am beginning to get tired of this type of Bs. And they never really have a good reason to ban the champion, they usually come up with the excuse.\r\n\r\n&quot;You will never get the champion.&quot; - There is a 10 out of all the champions of me not getting my champion.\r\n&quot;They will pick it before you.&quot; - Yeah, they could. But since I play this champion I know how to counter the champion.\r\n&quot;I just do not think this champion is good.&quot; - That is your problem, not mine. You may not be good at the champion, however I can probably play the champ better than you.\r\n&quot;I do not think you are good at the champion.&quot; - How the F*** do you know? We in champ select. Have you even checked my account on Lolking, Na.Op.GG?\r\n&quot;They will ban the champ anyway.&quot; - This is a massive lie, 5 out of 50 games have I had my actual champion banned by the enemy team.\r\n\r\nThose are just few excuse. If they really do not want me to play my champion, then let the enemy ban my champion or dodge. Those two are better than you banning my champion with no actual reason.\r\n\r\nSincerely, HyperTechno.","replies":[{"poster":"General Esdeath ","date":"2017-12-18T05:33:51.369+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"\" Yeah, they could.

Never flame but I can be tilted. What tilts me? Riven or Zed on the enemy team. I will always auto ban one of these two, hover or not. If someone is hovering them, I apologize and say sorry, but if on the off chance the enemy team picks it first, I'm probably going to be immediately tilted and have a worse match because of it. You may know how to counter Riven, but after 5 years I still don't get that shit.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Coopa123","date":"2017-12-17T18:21:20.081+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"People will still find ways to troll.\n\nPre-picking a very strong champion to prevent your team from banning it and then letting the enemy team play that champion is just as douchy as banning pre-picked champions.\n\nWhen I think back to when Kassadin was so ridiculously broken that he was banned in 93% of all ranked games I get the shivers","replies":[]},{"poster":"sleepysithlord","date":"2017-12-18T14:33:27.266+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem is sometimes its totally reasonable to ban a teamates champion. If my last pick adc is hovering ezreal, and he does nothing to communicate with our first pick top laner to grab him ezreal, I am banning ezreal. Why? Because Ezreal is op right now, and there is no way he will make it to pick number 9 0r 10.","replies":[{"poster":"HyperTechno","date":"2017-12-18T15:09:48.752+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You just have to accept that, their is a higher chance of the guy wanting to troll or flame. I understand that Ez is strong right now and you want the lowest chance of the enemy picking him, but there are champions that can still counter him. \n\nEven if your Mid, Top, Jungle, Support, or ADC.\n\nEz has 3 skill shots and one dash. That just mean you either have to learn how to dodge skill shots or pick a champions with CC that can deny him to activate his abilities. \n\nBliz would be a good champion. The CC Bliz possess can deny Ez to cast his abilities or could bait out his dash. \n\nThresh just like blitz.\n\nSona is not only a healer, but also a fantastic damage dealer. The combinde damage between Sona and the ADC could keep Ez at bay. Because if he goes in there is a likelihood the traid will go to Sona's ADC's faivor. Or if he is unlucky the Sona will pop her ult on him and he can do nothing.\n\nMalz may not be a support, but he has the abilities to destroy almost any champion.\n\nFind a way to beat the champion you hate. Keep banning Ez wont make you better against him. I did not learn how to counter Teemo, Garen, Malz, Kat, Kas, Quinn, Zoe, Fiora, and Riven by banning them. I faced the challenge head on and lost many games, until I could beat them.\n\nAlso, if I want to beat an Ez, I just go Quinn mid, Kat mid, or Zoe mid, and find good roaming chances. However I am in bronze so the likelihood of me finding that is almost Zero.","replies":[{"poster":"sleepysithlord","date":"2017-12-18T15:26:10.580+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't \"hate\" any champion.

But people should have their on freewhile. I just do not ban champions depenting on their win rate. But we have our diffrences there.\n\nI have played Camille, or I main her, and I have found good success with her even though she has a 40% win rate. Ez just has a larger win rate becasue of his damage output on his Q, dodgeing it will cost him mana and lots of damage. While Camille has massive damage for her Q, and W. However, Camille is all about getting into peoples face, while Ez is all about safe play and as we \"in your face\" players call it, \"Pussy game play.\" Making him easy to play.\n\nAlso, sorry for saying you hate the champions.","replies":[{"poster":"sleepysithlord","date":"2017-12-18T16:04:29.993+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey no worries, no offense taken.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"DarthNocturnis","date":"2017-12-18T00:32:32.061+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Two people want the same champ.\nBan that champ to avoid arguments.\n\nYeah, I need to be able to ban my teammates' champ declarations.","replies":[]},{"poster":"sAyCo","date":"2017-12-17T17:54:54.370+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You reasons are ok, but there is another reason, for we should ban any champion we want.\nAnd sometimes they do that because your lonely champion, wont be useful for the team fights, compared to other team countering champions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Magical Player","date":"2017-12-17T18:22:27.921+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"I do love seeing the Op Bard In my game\nOr the shaco support\nOr the Adc Sona\nI can't imagine the amount of games it took those players to get good at those heros\nbut man when I look them up\nand see 50+% win rate jinx\nand 33% sona\nI can't help but think If i ban sona they'll play jinx \n\nBut hey\nMeta is meta,you do what you want\nOff meta is great","replies":[]}]}
