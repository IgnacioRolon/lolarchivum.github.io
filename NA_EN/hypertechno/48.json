{"poster":"HyperTechno","date":"2018-02-28T16:57:15.411+0000","title":"Insight for my next champion concept.","subforum":"General Discussion","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have been working on my next champion concept for a while now, now I can give some insight on what I&#039;m doing.\n\nSo I wanted to use my username for this next champion concept, but it is a maybe because I have made so many concepts where I used HyperTechno and changed it to something different.\n\nThe plan is: Make him this lying spoiled kid who ran from his hometown after he lost everything, then settles down at an ignorant village where he gets known as this &quot;void killer&quot; but is then wanted by the village when the void destroys a major amount of the village and captures the girl he had faith and trust in. Learning from his past mistakes he returns to his hometown, where he is taught to create hextech armor and weapons. At the age of 21, he becomes the real void hunter he claimed to be and the warrior the void fears. The story of HyperTechno goes from him losing everything at the age of 8, then becoming known around Runetera at the age of 10. Then at the age of 11, because everything he had told the world was untrue, he lost everything again because of one little incident. (Just a small spoiler: Kai&#039;sa and HyperTechno does have a relationship with each other. Not because I think they should, but because it is there to increases his will to survive and fight for the world later on in the story. Yes, I am giving him voice lines when he is with or against Kai&#039;sa but he doesn&#039;t know it is her.)\nSo Hyper returns to his hometown, where he is not really welcomed. The rest you can read in his lore when I release him.\n\nSo I wanted to be careful about his kit. Since I like the idea of a champion being able to one-shot somebody with one ability I wanted to give him one. But as we all know people do not like that, Zoe can be taken as a good example. I started out by looking at Zoe&#039;s kit and peoples critics since his Ult is almost like Zoes Q, but majorly different. To find ways to balance such an ability out, I think I did a good job, but you all will be the judge of that.\n\nI will be posting HyperTechno&#039;s kit soon, so I can see what others think and what could be changed. Since HyperTechno is a man who has studied the void for a long time and gotten knowledge from the resurrected creatures, that was once attacked by the void. (He befriends a Darkin, I will not tell you who, it will be in the lore.) His kit is going to be surrounded by ways to kill void creatures. Take Malzahar&#039;s Passive, HyperTechno&#039;s Ult will be able to penetrate that shield and any passive like it. (Yasuo, Pantheon, etc.) Cho, who is tanky, Hyper will adapt to his opponent thanks to his many settings his armor possesses. \n\nI tried to make Hyper into this Marksman/Marksman, Tank.\n\nHis W and E are two utility abilities, his W being his ability making him a tank and his E making him a high damage, but easy to kill, marksman. His Q and ult are his only damage abilities. He has no point and clicks, all is skill shot related. I tried to make him this easy to understand but hard to master champion. His passive was the hardest to create because I wanted to relate his passive with his story, so I named it &quot;Nothing to Fear&quot; but the name may be changed to &quot;Fearless Rage.&quot;\n\nWhen I saw Riot saying &quot;We want to make a champion like Vayne.&quot; I thought through storytelling, not by the kit. So I was kinda disappointed by Kai&#039;sa, but she is still fun to play. GJ Riot. But then I wanted to take the opportunity to read Vayne&#039;s lore and base HyperTechno kinda in the same way. Vayne lost everything to darkness, Hyper lost everything to the Void. Their stories are massively different, but I took the &quot;I lost everything to this, now I want to prevent the same thing from happening to others.&quot; plot. Kinda like Batmans plot.\n\nBut this is a little insight of what I&#039;m planning. The kit will be out soon so I can get your critics on it.","replies":[]}
