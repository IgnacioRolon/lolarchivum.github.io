Now, Riot that isn&#039;t to say you did a fantastic job. This post is all about the bugs, and things I hate about the new Aatrox.\n\nThe passive is new, (Unlike the max health damage.) else I like the idea.\n\nThe Q too slow. Seriously, WTF is with this Q. Anybody could dodge this shit. Even his Basic Attack animation cancels itself out at times, and he attacks way too slow. Fucking annoying. Find a way to fix that. \n\nI think the W is, fine. It has some good synergy with his abilities, and it gives some good CC. But the puling effect should be shortened, it takes far to long for it to be any good if you don&#039;t hit your first or second Q within the sweet spot.\n\nThe cooldown is way too long and only has two uses, really defeats the synergy. It&#039;s also way too short for any real use. Yeah, it gives nice reposition tactics, where you can get your enemy into the sweet spot, but what is it worth when the Q is so slow, and they can reposition. The damage increase is meh, same with his healing. \n\nThe ult does look like Swain. But honestly, I don&#039;t care. As long as it&#039;s cool and it isn&#039;t a health sucker, burst attack, then I&#039;m ok with the Ult. However, the healing is mediocre, and the slow is not needed. \n\nOut of all the champion reworks, I have seen, this one sucks. Too many bugs, and stuff. CertanT would have been a better person for the Aatrox&#039;s Rework. Since he worked on Warwick, and his Warwick rework was called the best Rework. \nIf you&#039;re going to rework a sensitive champion, people do play and love. Pick the people who did the best reworks, even ask Aatrox main&#039;s to test out your prototype. Like you did with Irelia.\n\nI have heard nothing else but negative words from Aatrox mains and lovers. Negative words deserved, to a badly reworked champion.\n\nAnyway, hope you all have a fantastic day. GL HF.\n\n{{sticker:vlad-salute}}","replies":[]}
