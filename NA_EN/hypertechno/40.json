I have made so many versions, looks like most of my fellow Quinn main's and friends agree on this version, so this is the version that's going to be release.\n\n**(Passive) Heightened Senses:** Valor reveals the area around Quinn.\n\nRange: 2300 \n\n**(Q) Swoosh - Active:** Quinn commands Valor to attack, covering 1025 units down the target path. Valor's path is determined where Quinn stands but can fly down form anywhere.\n\nDamage: 25 - 130 (80% - 120% AD)\nRange: Global\nCooldown: 20 - 11\nCost: 50 - 80\n\n(Q) Passive: If Valor hit an enemy and Quinn is within 550 units from the enemy, they are marked Vulnerable. (Vulnerable; Quinn's next auto attack towards the Vulnerable enemy is a triple shot, dealing 45 - 100 (+ 80 - 120% AD) bonus physical damage.\n\n**(When Behind Enemy Lines is Active; Q) Hurricane:** Quinn orders Valor to drop her and swirl around her 4 times, dealing physical damage to all enemies hit.\n\nDamage: 25 - 130 (80% - 120% AD) per hit.\nRange: 1025\nCooldown: 20 - 11\nCost: 50 - 80\n\n**(W) Tactical Blind - Active:** Quinn collects dirt and throws it at the target location in a cone. Blinding and disarming the first enemy hit for 2 seconds.\n\nDamage: 0\nRange: 550\nCooldown: 15 - 10\nCost: 0\n\n**(When Behind Enemy Lines is Active; W) Gust:** Quinn orders Valor to drop her, then to blow a dust cloud towards a target location in a cone. Blinding and disarming all enemies hit for 2 seconds.\n\nDamage: 0\nRange: 600\nCooldown: Follows Tactical Blind's cooldown.\nCost: 0\n\n**(E) Vault - Active:** Quinn dashes to the target unit, knocking them back, dealing them physical damage, and slowing them by 50% which decays over 1.5 seconds, before leaping back and landing 525 units away from them.\n\nDamage: 40 - 160 (+ 60%)\nRange: 675\nCooldown: 12 - 8\nCost: 50 mana\n\n(E) Passive: Grants Quinn bonus attack speed and bonus movement speed for 2 seconds.\n\nBonus (AS): 40% - 120%\nBonus (MS): 20% - 40%\n\n**(When Behind Enemy Lines is Active; E) Passive:** When Quinn dashes to the target enemy Valor attacks doing Striking Assult and marking them Vulnerable. (Striking Assult: The enemy is stunned instead of slowed for 2 seconds, dealing 40 - 160 (+ 40 - 80% AD) bonus physical damage.) (Vulnerable; Quinn's next auto attack towards the Vulnerable enemy is a triple shot, dealing 45 - 100 (+ 80 - 120% AD) bonus physical damage.\n\n**(R) Behind Enemy Lines - First Active:** Quinn channels for 2 seconds. Upon completing it successfully, Valor picks her up and they unite, increasing her total movement speed and gaining the ability to use Skystrike.\n\nSuffering immobilizing crowd control effects while Behind Enemy Lines is channeling cancels it. Taking damage from champions, monsters, or turrets while Behind Enemy Lines is active removes the bonus movement speed for 3 seconds.\n\nIf you have a least one point in Behind Enemy Lines, respawning or returning to the summoning platform will spawn Valor.\n\n**(R) Skystrike - Second Active:** Quinn detaches from Valor, ending Behind Enemy Lines' effects, and deals 40% AD physical damage to all units around her.\n\nLaunching a basic attack, Hurricane, Gust, or Vault during Behind Enemy Lines automatically activates Skystrike.\n\nLet me know what you think? But I'm not going back to the work table, this one here to stay. I have too many projects. My next champion concept is named Leria.","replies":[]}
