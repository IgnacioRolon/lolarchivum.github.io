My last two games today, I did well. Until my team decided to feed their fucking heads off and play like actual idiots. \r\n\r\nI do not know what my fucking MMR is, but I can tell you that the people I am teamed up with do not know what the fuck they are doing. No warding, texting their ass off, giving up objectives even if we are ahead, no map awareness, no MACRO, nothing but their heads up their ass.\r\nOh, we are two kills ahead, let us turret 2v4 dive them and give them two free kills. Then flame everyone for my mistake except me, because I am a diamond player. Riot, I know my placement is in bronze, but holy shit. I need pure luck if I want to get a team as good as me or better.\r\nI am not saying I am deserving of Plat or higher. But I am definitely not at the bronze level anymore, but no matter how hard I try, no matter how hard carrying I am in a game, I cannot win in bronze unless if I have luck on my side. \r\nMy last Quinn game, my Cs was ok, my KDA was good. But then at Mid to the Late game, follow up's were non-existent at that point. I died so many, god damn times, because they lacked the positioning, ward placement, and non-existent follow up. I even tried to ping and text \"ward\" to them, nothing. WHY AM I GETTING STUPID PEOPLE FOR TEAMMATES RIOT. WE SHOULD BE AT THE POINT WHERE MOST PEOPLE ARE DONE WITH THEIR GOD DAME PLACEMENT GAMES. THIS SHOULD NOT BE AS BIG OF AN ISSUE, AS IT SHOULD BE.\r\n\r\nThe thing that really pisses me off is the fact that I won 10 out of 8 games in my placement, and I am still in bronze. Why am I still in bronze, I crawled from the depts of B5 to B2 at the last part of last season, I kinda deserve some credit guys. \r\n\r\nI am in B2 got into B1, but then the cycle of dumbasses came into the game again and I am almost back in B3. For FUCK SAKE, why?\r\n\r\nRiot, I do not know how to increase my MMR and I'm kinda giving less than two shits right now, but I am tired of relying on luck to win games.","replies":[{"poster":"WebWeaver","date":"2018-02-05T01:34:52.382+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"im in the middle of gold and its absolute trash. its a coin flip as to what team gets the players who are either smurfing and boosting accounts or its people who have zero idea what to do and feed beyond belief.

This was one loss after a 10 game win streak by the way, how is it that after a 10 game win streak the players on my team are literally in bronze in stead of high silver/low gold. Like make the que times longer and give me players in my own fucking elo riot.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ZephyrDrake","date":"2018-02-05T00:16:50.153+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"bronze player complaining about bronze teammates being bad... ok","replies":[]}]}
