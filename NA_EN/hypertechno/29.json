When 10% of enemies health is infected, they lose 5% of their defensive stats permanently until the stacks are removed. When 75% of an enemies health is infected, Liali can execute that enemy.\n\n(Q) Wolf Claw - First Cast: After a .5 second-delay, Liali slashes with her sword to deal Attack damage physical damage to all enemies in the target direction, applying on-hit effects to the first target hit.\n\n(Q) Wolfs Anger - Second Cast: Liali casts Wolfs Anger. If it hits an enemy, Liali can gain another Wolfs Anger stack to which she can cast Wolf Howl.\n\n(Q) Wolf Howl - Third Cast: Liali unleashes a dark slash that travels an increased distance in the target direction, dealing bonus damage.\n\n(W) Shadow Dance - Active: Liali summons a shadow wolf in a target direction, that clone will run for 3 seconds until recast and Liali switches places with that clone.\n(W) Passive: When switching with a clone, Liali gains bonus attack speed and movement speed.\n\n(E) Inner Torture - Active: Liali throws a shadow ball. If the shadow ball hits an enemy target, the target loses health depending on how much of enemies health is infected with Bane. If it misses, it creates a zone that damage enemies passing it, dealing magic damage every .5 seconds.\n\n(R) Shadow Master - Active: Liali enters True Stealth for 2 (+ .5 seconds per 100 AD) seconds, and will not break the stealth if she attacks. Enemies near Liali will be infected with Bane every .5 seconds.\n(R) Balancing: Liali is limited to basic attacking only, executing an enemy will break the stealth.","replies":[{"poster":"Genghis Khat","date":"2018-11-27T13:43:16.719+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thicc waifu. i like. :)\n\nhaving :true stealth: plz dont put her in game.","replies":[{"poster":"HyperTechno","date":"2018-11-28T21:16:32.473+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IKR, I was hesitant about the Ult though, because Akali and people hate her. If you have an idea for how I can change it then plz tell me, it may not be as you suggested, but I will gladly change a thing or two.

I don't know, how often those stacks need to be refreshed, but it would take a long time to proc her passive and even then it wouldn't have so much influence on the game... what i dont understand is, if they loose that defense stats permanently or only for some time?\nI would rework that passive, but i do like the idea of stacking hits on enemy champions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Attysu The Poro","date":"2018-11-27T03:51:53.285+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Was that actually drawn by you? Cause wow she is so pretty.\n\nI'm not super good with the whole stats/ability thing, but I do think that her r being only a stealth move is a bit odd. It's a good escape but doesn't have much affect in terms of a fight. It kind of reminds me of Eve stealth but on her R instead? Maybe have it so that if R is active, a third of your bane you have on someone is added on top of any enemies marked, so when you get out of stealth you have a better chance at killing them? If I'm not wrong she reminds me of an assassin.","replies":[{"poster":"HyperTechno","date":"2018-11-27T04:20:57.013+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I did not draw her.\n\nMy intention was not to make an Assassin, but she turned out like one. I was going for a more Yasuo style fighter. But in the end, I am happy with the result and I will not be doing much more to her kit.\n\nLiali is able to attack during her stealth, which will be game breaking. Then I saw what you wrote and I added a little more to it, not in the way you suggested, but just so it does not look underwhelming.\n\nThanks for the comment.\n\nGL HF\n\n{{sticker:vlad-salute}}","replies":[]}]}]}
