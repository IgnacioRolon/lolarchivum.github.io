Honestly, I like most of them. But.\r\n\r\nDianna didn&#039;t need a new skin, Vlad does. Seriously Riot, you have such a massive collection of champions with almost no skins, and Dianna gets a new skin, again. The same feeling came when you released the Project: Vayne, and Jhin. They are not bad, but I&#039;m just thinking, &quot;Why Vayne? She already has a massive skin collection, and why Jhin, again.&quot; \r\n\r\nI know that I say this a lot, but where is Quinn&#039;s skin? Concepts everywhere, not even one was picked up. It&#039;s not just Quinn, but I think, Quinn needs a new beautiful skin. It has been 5 to 6 years now, and more people are playing her. So if it&#039;s for the money, this might be a good time. But I don&#039;t know, that&#039;s up to you. I  think that you&#039;re wasting good ideas for Quinn skins.\r\n\r\nTeemo didn&#039;t need a skin, but it&#039;s so cute I can&#039;t say it&#039;s not ok. You win this time.\r\n\r\nRiot&#039;s skins have improved significantly, and I am not trying to tell you they are doing a bad job. Far from it. However, most of their champion choices annoy the hell out of me. Dianna, Riven, Miss Fortune, Vayne, Jhin, Ezreal (The SG one, I don&#039;t know why I hate it.).\r\nI have seen many begging for a Project: Riven skin, and I do like how they took the idea, but change the name to Pulsfire. So I&#039;m not going to complain, it&#039;s well designed and all, but I won&#039;t buy it. I already have her best skins.\r\n\r\nHere are some of my thoughts, and I know some will agree and disagree. But, I really, need this off my chest. Thanks for reading.\r\n\r\nHave success in all your games. GL HF &lt;3\r\n{{sticker:vlad-salute}}","replies":[]}
