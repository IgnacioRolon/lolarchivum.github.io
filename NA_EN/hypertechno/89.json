I need them solved.","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Before I start, the subject is about the matchmaking system. Not that it&#039;s bad, but because I found something, I think, is odd.\r\n\r\nIn my last TF game. \r\nhttps://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/2803466699/233682355?tab=overview\r\nhttp://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=HyperTechno\r\n\r\nI found out that the enemy team had the better win rates overall. (The win rates listed are from Mobalytics)\r\n\r\nEnemy team:\r\nS4 - Aatrox: 54% 7/2/1\r\nS1 - Mundo: 64% 4/6/7\r\nB4 - Taliyah: 49% 4/2/9\r\nS4 - Jinx: 47% 7/4/6\r\nS4 - Malzahar: 47% 4/3/6\r\n\r\nMy team:\r\nS5 - Irelia: 36% 0/7/6\r\nS4 - Yi: 47% 3/5/2\r\nS5 - TF (Me): 49% 3/4/2\r\nS5 - MF: 46% 9/5/3\r\nS4 - Tahm: 41% 1/5/9\r\n\r\nWhy is it, the enemy team has much higher win rates vs my team. That has me, as the only one, with a decent win rate. I know the Taliyah is in Bronze, where I now question, why the fuck is a B4 player playing in a Silver match in the first place? I can understand B1&#039;s and 2&#039;s, but 4&#039;s. Next question, why isn&#039;t the matchmaking system evolved around WR and MMR together? My team got stomped and titled their minds off, and I couldn&#039;t do anything because the enemy team was already really fed. My teams Win rate tells me everything, there is a reason they scored a low percentage.\r\n\r\nI find it odd, that their system doesn&#039;t account for both WR and MMR together. But I will leave that to you guys. Do you think its a problem?","replies":[{"poster":"Aptest","date":"2018-06-11T21:10:28.698+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1 Win rates reflect your previous success with the champion this season. Therefore they represent not your current strength as a player, but your strength relative to past matches. If these past matches were against stronger players (you have been placed higher than your true skill at beginning of season) than your win rate <50%. if you were miss-matched low and had to climb, than rates high. \n\nThis is why WR is not useful in _this type _of matchmaking system.\n\n2 Because WR is a useless stat that isn't used, the difference in WR is just a fluke. A chance happening.\n\n3 B4 is duo with S1. This is the reason for the crazy skill spread in OPFOR team and for both being in am otherwise S4 game. \n\n4 Not a problem. WR can be used as a core for a matchmaking system (in a truly tiered system), or MMR can be used. Both can not be used together.","replies":[]}]}
