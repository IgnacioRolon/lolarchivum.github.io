What is your opinion?","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"To keep the post short, I will not go into too many personal details and experiences. I want Riot to find a way to buff Zoe without making her OP on people who have mastered her. In terms of balance, she is on the more weaker side compared to most mages. It is hard to buff her, Zoe's identity is a one-shot combo burst mage, and people are not fond of the idea of being one-shot. I understand, but right now it almost impossible unless if you are fed or got plenty of DH stacks. \n\nI do have some ideas:\n\n> Revert the damage nerfs on her Passive. In all honesty, Neeko does more damage with her W, which is a three-hit passive that does more than TF's E. Letting Zoe get her Passive poke potential back, should not be a problem.\n\nOr\n\n> Decrease the mana cost on Q. This is a helpful buff without giving her damage, her farming would be less punishing. Her E should be the most punishing, not her Q. Most mages right now will beat Zoe in mana, because Zoe's only way to farm is by using her Q through the entirety of the game. This a helpful buff without increasing her one-shot potential.\n\nOr\n\n> Let Zoe's Q have an infinite AP scaling the further it travels. This is the buff suggestion I will get the most hate from, I already know. This buff is mostly personal, I find it odd that Zoe's Q does not scale infinitely. Sometimes, I want to make a smake play, with a Q-R-Q-F combo and expect to do tons of damage since I may have sacrificed my Flash in the process.\n\nLet me know what you all think. If you disagree, feel free to write it down. If you agree but feel that some of my suggestions are bad, please give me your thoughts.","replies":[{"poster":"chipndip1","date":"2018-12-29T19:24:05.188+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"She's honestly fine as she is.

I want a buff that is helpful for those in lower elo without making people in high elo or masters like myself OP with her. As someone who does play Zoe a lot, and fought from counters to none counters, I find that her all-around power balanced. But her farming is vastly lagging, and I mean overall burst mage wise. Champions like Neeko, Ahri, Brand, and LeBlanc have superior farming although being burst mages.\nHer power overall is fine where it stands, but her farming should get a touchup. \n\nThe state you show is only slightly off, according to U.GG, Zoe's Wr stands at a 49% and a Pr of 7% worldwide. You are looking at the Korean server, which is still valid of course. With that in mind, that means Korea is the only server with the better, success.\n\nThen we have champions like Cass (W), Ahri (W), Kass (W), Neeko (W), Galio (KR), Zed (W) who have either similar or better Wr and Pr. Letting Zoe reach a 50 or 51% Wr should not be a problem, especially if it only targeted on her farming. My second suggestion would be by far the best option since it does not influence how strong she is, other than she would be able to stay in lane longer earlier in the game.\n\nTrust me, I have a solution if she gets too strong.\n\n> Second Suggestion:\nPaddle Star mana cost lowered from ~~50 / 55 / 60 / 65 / 70~~ to 40 / 45 / 55 / 65 / 70 \n\nThis is a big buff to the early game in mana. A 10 mana decrease during early, but will equal out to her old mana cost during the mid-game. It will make her stronger for less experienced players, but be a nice little pat on the back for us who are pros with her. No damage added or needed, lowering the cooldown would make her a monster. The only thing that could possibly make her stronger in lower levels of play without making her an empress in high, would be to buff her mana cost. \n\nBut I could be wrong so let me know what you think.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Psyrix","date":"2018-12-29T20:40:14.542+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Zoe is actually quite fine rn, she really needs not buffs nor nerfs atm.   If she does get a passive buff, it’d have to be like 10-20 dmg because the way it can be comboed with her other abilities is what warrants the way it is rn.   Q scaling infinitely is a hard no imo, sure it heavily rewards predictive play style (as u’d have to do Q Q ult flash to leverage that change) but it ultimately makes her unfun to play against in that if a stray q does hit u it does legit have the chance to kill u with no E to have been needed....  a nice buff (imo) would probs be to her ult, giving it back the vision over walls... but unlikely tbh","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zoe Fatone","date":"2019-02-18T19:58:54.498+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She needs to go back to her PBE pre launch status.","replies":[]}]}
