In the invasion of his home by the Void, Uukahaa was forced to find a new home for him and his people. Runetera, a world filled with magic, magic stronger than their own. This magic introduced unknown powers within him. Power so strong it could be felt miles away. However, this power let to the Darkin War. Uukahaa stood almost victor until they found a way to turn the tables, they sealed his four best soldiers and used them against him. The Darkins where almost wiped out. Even with Uukahaa&rsquo;s power to decimate an army with ease, his last men fell, the Darkins were no more. Unable to kill Uukahaa they took the option to seal him, sealing him into his crown.\nUpon Uukahaa&rsquo;s release, a sudden chain reaction between his blood magic and the magic surrounding the Isles combine together, creating an explosion that turned the Isles into the Shadow Isles. In his waking, Uukahaa felt a new power swirling within him, a power unique to him, Shadow Magic.\n(I do not know what happened first, the king turning the Isles into the shadow Isles or Zed getting his shadow powers. Because I want to link Zeds power to Uukahaa. If you do not like the idea, you may dislike it, but please do comment on it so I can change his lore and intro.)\n\n\nTHEME\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBjHPqMz0q0\n\nLORE\nComing Soon\n\nVOICE LINCE\nComing Soon\n\nABILITIES\n\nPassive - Shadow Quintessence:\nWhenever an enemy is hit by Uukahaa a small part of their health is turned black; 3% per ability and 1% per basic attacks.\n \nIf that enemy is not damaged after 5 seconds, it will then damage the enemies over time for 2% of the enemies max health for every 10% of Shadow Quintessence removed.
