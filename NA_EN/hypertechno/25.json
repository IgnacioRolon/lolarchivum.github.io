Enemies with Shadows Torture have their adaptive damage and attack speed decreased to a max of 20/30/40/50/60% (depending on level) depending on distorted health going from 2/3/4/5/6% (depending on level) per 7.5% of enemies max health distorted. If an enemy with Shadows Torture it not damaged by Liali within 4 seconds, 50/62.5/75/87.5/100% (depending on level) of distorted health becomes TD overtime of 12 seconds. Enemies above 85% of distorted max health, will unpreventably die overtime of 6 seconds by Liali's basic attack.\n\n(BaR) Q - Strike [Range: Melee, Mana: 15, Cooldown: 10]: Liali strikes out with her Katana dealing 15/30/45/60/75 (+ 120% AD) Physical Damage. Trickers on-hit effects.\n\n(Active) W - Darkness Dance [Range: None, Mana: 45, Cooldown: 55/54/52/50/45]: Liali turns to a shadow for 2/2.25/2.50/2.75/3 seconds, enabling her to walk past minions, and none basic attack based abilities go past her. She is unable to attack during Darkness Dance. Recasting the ability will turn her back to normal.\n\n(SS) E - Torture Within [Range: 650, Mana: 80/78/75/73/70, Cooldown: 25]: Liali throws a ball of darkness towards the target direction. Hitting an enemy champion will chain them to Liali, slowing Liali for 20%. If an enemy is within 800 units for 4 seconds, Liali slows the enemy by 60% for 2 seconds and doubling Shadows Torture's damage conversion. \n\n(Cone) R - Shadowsphere [Cone Range: 800/1000/1200, Mana: 80, Cooldown: 60]: Liali slashed out towards the target direction, creating a fog traveling with her slash. Enemies hit by her slash are dealt 50/75/100 (+ 40% AP) Magic Damage, then enemies caught are under Shadow Imprisonment unable to leave for 6 seconds. Shadow Imprisonment develops into a spere equal to her slash range. Enemies caught under Shadow Imprisonment are hidden to the outer world and are inflicted with Shadows Torture distorting 2/2.5/3% of their max health each second. If Liali enters Shadow Imprisonment, she will be under True Stealth to turrets, enemies in and out of Shadow Imprisonment, and cannot break stealth within it. However, Liali can only see and attack imprisoned enemies. Enemies and allies entering Shadow Imprisonment will become nearsighted, and enemies are inflicted with Shadows Torture distorting .5/.75/1% of their max health each second.\n\nNote: Art and Music is NOT mine.","replies":[]}
