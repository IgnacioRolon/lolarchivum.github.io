So that got me thinking how do I practice this, and how can I get good at it. And what is it I am doing wrong. \r\n\r\nI am in B3 and I am nowhere near as good as a Diamond and over. But I have found out that many Plats, play almost the same way as a bronze player would with some minor differences. So I came to a question. From Bronze 5 to Plat 1, is it just luck that determines your rank or is it the actual understanding of the game that determines your rank in those elos?\r\n\r\nMost post, on this topic, has not been useful. So I am not going to ask, how do I get better. But how can I improve my Macro, Micro, and Mechanics while I play the games, and how can I find my mistakes.","replies":[{"poster":"Quepha","date":"2017-12-06T05:40:35.596+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I learned a ton from watching Neace's coaching videos. There are a lot of mistakes common in most of the people he coaches so you probably make a bunch of the same ones.\n\nA big mistake a lot of players make is roaming without pushing their lane first. They see high elo or pro players roaming a lot to help other lanes, but they don't notice that those high elo players ALWAYS push their lane into a good position before doing this. Letting a wave of minions die to your turret while you're out of your lane is DEVASTATING to your gold and xp totals in addition to causing major damage to your turret.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ironfield","date":"2017-12-06T05:29:47.119+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Watching streams/youtube videos really helped me with macro play. If you play top lane solorenektononly is really nice to watch, during gameplay he explains his rotations and decision making throughout the game. Leaguecraft 101 has some nice videos explains board topics of league too. \n\nBig difference between bronze and play is game knowledge, you can outplay your enemy as much as you want but if you dont know how to use that advantage then theres no point of ouplaying them in the first place.\n\nHope you find what youre looking for.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Feeding Lesbian","date":"2017-12-06T02:07:58.268+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think everything that's been said so far is pretty good advice.\n\nMy add is to also look for the mistakes others make. A big part of macro play is knowing where your enemy is and what they can and can't do, and how to make trades that end in your advantage. Ex: Enemy team is chasing a Tryn bot lane your team has 4 top to their 4 or 5 bot. That's an easy baron call or a good group push down top or mid.\n\nThere are many ways to use macro to your advantage. It starts with good map awareness and knowing how to manage your minion wave based on how well you're doing vs your opponent and how likely it is you will be ganked. It progresses into roams, grouping, or splitting to take objectives around the map depending on which lane you might be in and then ends in a stage that's either about grouping, fast rotations or good splitting/sieging. All of which takes practice, good reflection and game knowledge to excel at.\n\nGood luck out there!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kai Guy","date":"2017-12-06T01:59:48.728+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Watch your replays, check your numbers in post game, actively look for where you make mistakes.  There are some champions whos kits require macro mechanics to thrive. {{champion:4}} for example is good person to play to improve your map awareness. Some are good for micro as well,  {{champion:101}} is good for skillshots and anticipating movement, {{champion:115}}  is a lot like Xerath but a good bit easier to play. \n\nWhen looking at replays try to find parts of the game where momentum shifted.","replies":[]},{"poster":"nm1010","date":"2017-12-06T01:28:01.779+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Macro is really hard to improve in game, I would highly suggest getting a free coach from various league coaching websites to go over replays with you. They can really help explain what you should be doing differently at any point in the game and WHY you should be doing it.\n\nMicro is just playing a lot of games to get familiar with your champion. I would recommend watching a higher level player play the champion to get an idea of what you should be doing.\n\nMechanics are the things that you can learn through shear practice. Go into a custom game (or practice tool) and just try to get perfect cs, if you can't hit 45 @ 5 minutes or 200 @ 20 minutes start over and do it again. For harder mechanical exercises google some youtube videos and you should find plenty of exercises you can do.","replies":[]},{"poster":"oOBestEveNAOo","date":"2017-12-06T01:26:00.485+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Watch professional play.\n\nTry to work on anticipating the things the casters will discuss.\n\nWhen you get it down and you think along the exact same lines as they do when they do then you've become more adept at analyzing the macro state of the game. All that remains is to utilize this skill in game and then communicate effectively with your team.\n\nIt really is this easy.","replies":[]}]}
