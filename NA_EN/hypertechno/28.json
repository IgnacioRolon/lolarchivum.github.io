I have two rules when I make a concept or buff or nerf concept, maintain or compensation. \r\n\r\nWhen maintaining:\r\nNerf or buff one specific ability that would otherwise make them OP or extremely weak. You maintain a champion when a champion is actually broken or weak, never in a stable area. If we look at the planned Nautilus buffs and Morgana nerfs, they would be what I call a change of maintaining. Nautilus is in the dump so its good to see him getting some love, and Morgana is quite strong at the current moment. \r\n\r\nWhen compensating:\r\nThese are the types of changes I do not see many off but are the most needed. Sylas, Zoe, Neeko, Jayce, Kayle, and Rek'Sai are the champions in need of a compensation change, not maintaining because there it is one thing that makes them strong, therefore making them useless if removed. I would have agreed to the Zoe nerfs if they gave her something somewhere else. Sylas' heal is strong, but taking it away would devastation him as a champion, he needs something somewhere else. Same for Neeko and Rek'Sai, those nerfs will kill the champion off completely.\r\n\r\nTheir biggest flaw overall is no moderation. It is either too much or too little. Vayne, Kai, Sylas, Zoe, Akali, Neeko, and many more have become useless or broken because of this mindset. \r\n\r\nI think many people would get the wrong idea when I criticize a nerf or buff. Because Ranked somehow makes you biased or unbiased, when all ranks have their own bias. Yes, I am biased when it comes to Zoe, beat me on the head with it, but again, I still want her to be fair while useful. I try my best not to be biased because not everyone thinks like me. \r\nI can see how people would find Zoe frustrating to play against, but should she be punished for that? No. Same for Neeko, Fizz, Vlad, Ahri, Zed, and any champion people may find frustrating to play against. So yeah. \r\n\r\nHope people like my post, and the rules I use. Please, tell me what you think, that is why I write these.","replies":[]}
