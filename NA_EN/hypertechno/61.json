Everone is entitled to their opinion. So be nice to everyone.)\r\n\r\nSo I have had my fun with the new and updated items, and now I&#039;m here to ruin it for me and others. Here is the list of champs, that I think, is guaranteed to be overpowered in 8.10 and 8.11. \r\n\r\nYi:\r\nRiot if you read this, give him some type of nerf because with the new IE, maybe patch 8.10, he is going to be a monster. 40% True Damage with Conquer and IE alone, plus his E, that gives him 18-50 (+ 35% AD) extra True Damage. \r\nLet&#039;s take the new IE&#039;s damage and see the True damage. \r\n\r\nNew IE AD: 80 \r\nYi&#039;s basic AD (Level 7): 79\r\nThat&#039;s 159 AD together.\r\nThat&#039;s 63 AD as True Damage.\r\nLevel 2 E: 81 True Damage.\r\nYou get a total of 144 true damage per hit.\r\n\r\nBut he has to build crit, yeah, but the funny thing is now IE doubles his Crit chance, fun right. Get an SS and a PD you good, it fits his build path, and he isn&#039;t going to give a fuck about you or anyone at that point. He is going to be this super mobile true damage dealing Yasuo who can crit forever. If my team does not give me 3 heavy CC champs and I see Yi on the enemy team, fuck that shit I&#039;m out. Did I mention, the new Essence Reaver lets him Q for eternity when his Ult is active? It does, good luck hitting the motherfucker.\r\n\r\nOn the topic of Yasuo, yes, Yasuo:\r\nOh man, is he going to enjoy this the most? Yes, he will. His crit may not be as strong, but he is going to get 100% crit chance on the second item PD or how you want to order it first. True Damage with the new item, woohoo, is he going to be strong.\r\n\r\nSadly, my lovely Quinn:\r\nQuinn is probably the champion most benefiting from Stormrazor and the new IE. One of my game&#039;s I dealt 45,000 True Damage. As much as I like my favorite girl to be strong, there are limits. No nerfs needed for Quinn, but Stormrazor and new IE are just way too strong.\r\n\r\nFucking Hell Riot as if he isn&#039;t strong enough, ZED:\r\nOh my fucking lord riot. He does way to much damage, and the new item doesn&#039;t make it better. Crit and Duskblade, I&#039;m just going somewhere else to die, maybe to Minion Sticks.\r\n\r\nVayne, huh, why Vayne:\r\nSeriously Riot, she was a massive problem a year ago, why are we going back to that. She is going to be, pick or ban again.\r\n\r\nKAI&#039;SA:\r\nKai&#039;sa is already overwhelming as hell, especially if she&#039;s ahead, now it&#039;s going to be even more fun. I just love, to get more than 75% of my health cut off by an auto attack (Auto Attack, not an ability, a fucking Auto Attack. Unblockable, unless if your Teemo, your a peach of shit.), not two abilities like Zoe that only does 50%, no, four fucking auto attacks can do the trick. People say&#039;s Zoe is brain dead, yeah right, dodge Zoe&#039;s abilities and you will find yourself on top of her.\r\n\r\nThere are probably other champion&#039;s, like, Talon and so on. However, this is my list, and champion I have been playing or played against. But Riot, calm the hell down. Tanks are annoying as hell but don&#039;t make them unpickable. Too much True Damage and one champion that was a huge problem a year ago, is going to be a huge problem again, and an already overturned champion, is going to be massively overturned. But, oh well, it&#039;s not my game.\r\n\r\nLet me know what you think.","replies":[{"poster":"KZ Engel","date":"2018-05-09T03:08:21.655+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"yi 👏 does 👏 not 👏 build 👏 crit 👏\n\n{{item:1419}} {{item:3124}} gives him everything he needs, and more. a 3 item yi can solo baron with guinsoo's.","replies":[{"poster":"Sad Tyrant","date":"2018-05-09T08:04:42.278+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yi  👏 CAN👏 BUILD 👏 CRIT👏","replies":[{"poster":"Killer of Night9","date":"2018-05-09T08:32:32.874+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Sad Tyrant,realm=OCE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=xePGOOxz,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2018-05-09T08:04:42.278+0000)\n>\n> Yi  👏 CAN👏 BUILD 👏 CRIT👏\n\nIE used to cost 3800..\nGetting IE+zeal upgrade it's too expensive when he can get the less but enough power from {{item:3153}} {{item:3077}}{{item:1419}} _{{item:3124}} ","replies":[{"poster":"HyperTechno","date":"2018-05-09T13:57:23.815+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Killer of Night9,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=xePGOOxz,comment-id=000200000000,timestamp=2018-05-09T08:32:32.874+0000)\n>\n> IE used to cost 3800..\n> Getting IE+zeal upgrade it&#x27;s too expensive when he can get the less but enough power from {{item:3153}} {{item:3077}}{{item:1419}} _{{item:3124}}\n\nA good Crit path for Yi is {{item:1419}} {{item:3153}} {{item:3046}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3006}} {{item:3508}} that's the usual now Yi crit build.\n\nThe new build is going to be build like this, {{item:1419}}{{item:3153}} {{item:3046}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3508}} {{item:3006}} however, the change is he get's 60% CSC from PD, and he can Q forever thanks to ER. He not only does 12% of your max health as damage, if he crits on you, 40% of his damage is turned to True Damage. The old version is brutal, but this new updated version is not just better, there is going to be no counter play. Tanks will be taken down like butter and squishy champs won't be able to apply their damage because of his constant Q. I did it in a game, and got a penta without taking damage. You think he is bad now, just wait till this change, he will be pick or ban.\n\nThe build your suggesting is a normal hybrid Yi build, it's good, but the new build is going to sweep this under the rock. Tbh, I won't be playing Yi if this change comes through, I'm an asshole, but this is just way too strong and I will hate myself to put other people through this shit.\n\nYi is too easy too play and can scale way too hard, and this build will just make him even more of a brain dead champion, I can't stress it enough. I hate this build and I hate that Riot is doing this shit to people. \n\nYi's main weakness is CC, but because of his Q and the new ER, that won't be a problem. Alpha Strike, and don't get hit by anything, ever, while applying, what was the number I dealt, hum, 5,000 True Damage per hit, that's without the total. I did a total of 250,000 damage, that's not ok.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sad Tyrant","date":"2018-05-09T10:20:25.756+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yi 👏 CAN👏 BUILD 👏 CRIT👏\n\n# Can\n## Can \n###Can\n**Can**\nCan\n*Can*","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"GrReaper96","date":"2018-05-09T03:00:24.071+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dont forget\n{{champion:23}} {{champion:107}} {{champion:35}} \nSome of the best abusers of the IE + Storm combo","replies":[{"poster":"KZ Engel","date":"2018-05-09T03:11:46.578+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"rengar's not gonna be taking ie. huge waste. better spent on dusk","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Wild Geese","date":"2018-05-09T10:17:07.227+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Quinn is going to be so strong!
