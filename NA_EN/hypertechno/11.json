But whatever, Riot had it coming to them. The backlash is very much deserved, you know.\n\nListen, I'm not saying it's right, but right now it's not women being abused by men, it's now men being abused by men and women. Especially, if you're a white male, who doesn't fit the SJW, FN, or Riot's perspective. Holy.\nSee I'm ok with women's right, I think they are lovely creatures, oh wait, human beings. Same with men we also useful creatures, oh wait, human beings. Wait? Both women and men are human? Huh, why does it sound like that Riot is splitting people apart? Because they are.\n\nNo matter your race, whatever gender, we are all human. What Riot is doing is splitting us, as a species, and the same is the SJWs and FN. I understand it's frustrating, but we as a species need to unite again, not as a man, not as a woman, but as a humankind. We all need each other, Gods Kindom is not in one person, but all. Together, we created extraordinary things.\nDiversity is good. But must be created within reason. Here there is no reason, only hate, who see you as nothing more as a cattle. This what they want you to write, this is how they want you to think, they want you to hate. Don't give yourself to those brutes. They only lie and hate.\n\nThe male community is not mad because they lost the \"privilege\", as they call it, but they are treated as different. You telling us to shut up, makes the problem worse, making you the problem as well.","replies":[{"poster":"afmghost","date":"2018-09-03T12:30:13.170+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=HyperTechno,realm=NA,application-id=Ir7ZrJjF,discussion-id=b3JwRLAw,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2018-09-02T22:09:30.812+0000)\n>\n> Honestly, I just posted it to be funny.
