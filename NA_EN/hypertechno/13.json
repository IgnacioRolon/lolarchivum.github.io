The fun thing was, I had a discussion with a few people about the new Swain rework, then someone mentions that Swain now looks like the priest from Bells of Notre Dame. \r\nI am not the best person when it comes to drawing and making lyrics. So I just wanted to throw out the idea and see if anyone thought that it would be funny to do.\r\nIt would be even better if it was Riot that created the parody.","replies":[{"poster":"Zechmeister","date":"2018-01-30T00:48:54.690+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ha i imagined swain while watching that.\nI could probably come up with lyrics and stuff but i'm not a clean singer only deep screamer.\nLove that idea though would like to see it done.","replies":[]}]}
