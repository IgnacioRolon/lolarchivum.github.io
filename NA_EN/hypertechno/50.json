I&#039;m not here to offend or attack the Aatrox fan base. This is mostly opinion, and I will get a bit heated towards the end.)\r\n\r\nAs a past Riven main, hell he isn&#039;t close. Riven is animation canceling, Aatrox can&#039;t animation cancel. Making them thematically different.\r\n\r\nIs the new Aatrox, bad? No, not really. Could it have been better? Yes. (But, for fuck sack, any rework could be better.)\r\n\r\nNow, with the questions aside, time for the main point. \r\n\r\nComparing the old to the new, I prefer the newer. My five games with old Aatrox is enough to say, &quot;His kit was fucking everywhere, and very confusing.&quot; The knock up circle was too small although provided good diving potential. But, you will be a squishy fuck and die with ease, until you hit into the mid-game. His W were two passives, and, only, one used for 70% of the game. His E was the only ability I liked about his old kit. It provided a slow, and nice amount of damage. His R, super anti-climatic and boring. Unless if you got fed, you were useless. The only reason he was a top pick was the items. \r\n\r\nThen to his new kit, &quot;OMG, his kit has nothing from his old kit!&quot; Wait, have you read his abilities, and tried them out? His old W is his passive and E. His old Q is on his first Q and ThirdQ-E combo, and the effects of his old E has been altered, into his W.\r\n\r\nHis Ult is like Swains. Ok, who cares? Also, no. Swain&#039;s ult is a health sucker, that does burst damage. Aatrox&#039;s new ult is a much better version of his old crapy passive, that worked only 40% of the time. &quot;But, they took the skill base, out of it.&quot; After a few games with the new Aatrox, I can assure you. His ult is not as brain dead as it sounds and looks, too early you could risk losing your healing and die, and vice versa. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, is the new Aatrox bad, or a failed attempt?\r\nHonestly, they took a champion reliant on items, like Master Yi and Trynd. But not quite, like Yi and Trynd. Turning him into an understandable, and a functional, champ to play.\r\nHis Q is a three-hit active that does extra damage on the next Q, and more damage and a knock up if you hit the enemy in the sweet spot. (Riven&#039;s Q, doesn&#039;t do that, and Aatrox doesn&#039;t spin his sword. Unless if you count her last Q, then hurray. No point arguing with you because you can&#039;t seem to get the difference.) \r\nHis W is a skill shot, (Ahm, Riven&#039;s W is not a skill shot.) that slows and pulls the enemy into the center, and doesn&#039;t stun. (Wow, sound so much like Riven already. My GOSH.)\r\nHis E is a dash that gives him more damage and interacts with his Q and heals him. (Wow, if you count this, then you don&#039;t play Riven. She shields herself with her E, doesn&#039;t even add more damage that&#039;s her passive. Her E also don&#039;t interact with her Q.)\r\nHis Ult is, literally, his old passive. But better. It adds movement speed, increase damage, and revives himself, if he dies in that form. (Where is the burst, where is the execute, where the fuck is the similarities. You all only took one look at his Q and said: &quot;Riven 2.0&quot;.  I have played both, nothing, feels the same. What is it, people are crying about?)\r\nNo, Aatrox is a well-designed champion and has a kit that is very much his. The Q sounds like Riven, though so vastly different.\r\n\r\nAnyway, don&#039;t be offended Aatrox players. I understand the frustration. It&#039;s a champion you loved. However, making up the silly excuse like: &quot;It&#039;s Riven 2.0&quot; and &quot;It&#039;s Swain and Riven&#039;s child.&quot; is childish. Sorry.\r\n\r\nThe only similarities I could find between Aatrox and Riven was his Q being a three-hit active ability, and it pisses me off that the first thing you do is being straight out toxic towards Riot, shame.\r\n\r\nThe only thing I do agree on is his lines. He sounds like, a 5-year-old Rusian brat. I do like the Rusian voice idea, but change the lines to something more Aatrox.\r\n\r\nHope you have a wonderful day and GL HF.\r\n\r\n{{sticker:vlad-salute}}","replies":[]}
