Quinn probably has the best design&#039;s for some quite awesome skins, even the community came up with many designs and concepts. \r\nWe even know Riot isn&#039;t doing it for the money completely, Fiora, Yi, and Singed weren&#039;t as popular and they got new skins. They do have the technical strength to produce fantastic skins, so I won&#039;t buy that Bs that they do not have the technology to do it. They even have plenty of reasons to create a Quinn skin, fan art, and concepts from the community in a good amount.\r\nI just hate to see the concepts go to waist, and it really bothers me to see how they constantly ignore the Quinn community completely. See I do not hate the skins Riot has come out with, but I would really wish they would give the Quinn community something in return or the artist that made all the concepts.\r\n\r\nThis is what I hate about Riot, just because not many people play one champion it doesn&#039;t mean they aren&#039;t deserved of a beautiful skin. Just, come on Riot. I&#039;m not a part of the Quinn community as much anymore, but for fuck sake, give her a god damn skin. I&#039;m kinda tired of you giving zero shit about a champion that kinda needs some love.\r\nYou are literally, the assholes from her lore that underestimated her. Give her a chance and see if she amazes you.","replies":[]}
