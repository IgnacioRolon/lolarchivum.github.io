You can&#039;t even take an army of Voidlings.&quot;\nI smiled.\n&quot;Since I&#039;m probably going to die, I guess I will be the only one to end it all. I will fix all my wrongdoings of the past and probably meet my parents. I will seal the void but remember. The seal can&#039;t make it disappear, it will still stay in the lands. But won&#039;t be able to destroy... What are you thick headed clowns still here for? Get going, I got this! If anyone should die today, it should be me.&quot;\n\n**Passive - Undying Will:**\n When Einar reach under 10% of his health he forms a shield that blocks out 100 - 150 (+ 5% AP) ( + 10% Armor) ( + 10% Magic resist) damage for 6 to 10 seconds.\n\nExtra effects:\nWhen Undying Will activate, a mini shockwave is sent out knocking enemies within 100 units back by 50 units and stunning them for 2 seconds. Dealing 10 to 50 (+ 40% AP). Einar also goes to melee automatically and can&rsquo;t switch back to ranged, until the shield has decayed or used. If Einar reaches under 10%, all current CC on him will lose effect on him. His AS is increased by 20% to 100% (Depending on level) for the shield&#039;s duration. Einar&rsquo;s MS is also increased by 90% for the shield&rsquo;s duration. \n Cooldown: 1 minute\n\n**Q - Swirling Slash / Energy Projectile.**\nSwirling Slash:\nEinar sends an energy slash that goes straight and all nearby hit enemies will be dealt extra damage, the slash will then flatten. The ability can also be channeled increasing the range on the straight slash.\n\nSwirling Slash&rsquo;s Power:\nFrom 0 to 150 units the energy slash is straight dealing 50 to 200 damage as true damage through all enemies hit, at 150 to 500 units it is curved into a flat disc that does 200 to 600 (+ 60% AD) (+ 20% AP). At 150 units, Swirling Slash will lose 20% of its damage for every enemy champion hit and 2.5% for each minion hit. \n\nChannel Ability:\nIf the Q wasn&rsquo;t immediately cast after 1.5 seconds, a channel will begin. The ability can be channeled for up to 5 seconds, increasing the straight slash range. The range is increased by 150 units for every second. Going from 150 to 900 units. However, the ability will not go flat and travel any farther than 900 units.\n\nIf hit by the channel ability:\nSwirling Slash will deal 150 to 300 (+ 40% AD) true damage and 0% (+ 3% per 100 AP) of targets max health as true damage.\n\nThe extra effect when in channel:\nEinar becomes mobile under the channel. Not losing any mobility.\n\nEnergy Projectile:\nEinar charges up two shots. If the second shot hits the same target, it deals extra damage.\n\nEinar shotes two powerful energy projectiles both dealing 100 (+ 60% to 120% AD). The second shot has a 2-second delay after the first shot, if the second shot hits the same target is does 5% (+ 2.5% per 100 AP) more damage and 0% (+ 1.5% per 100 AP) of the damage as True damage.\n\nThe cooldown on both abilities are 15 seconds and cost 80 to 60 mana.\n\n**W - Weapon Switch:**\nWeapon Switch can be level up to 6 times and has one point already put into it.\n\nMelee:\nEinar deactivates his Marksman form, then activates his shield and hextech-sword. Decreasing his AA range to 150 units.\n\nPassive:\n45% to 75% of Einar&rsquo;s AD and AP is turned into Armor and Magic resist. Einar is also granted 20 health per 10 AD used to give armor. (Can&rsquo;t go under 65 AD and AP, if Einar can&rsquo;t reach 45% or 75% Einar just gain 40 to 160 spilled armor and magic resist.)\n\nSecondary Passive:\nOn the third basic attack, Einar smashes his shield against the enemy stunning them for 2 seconds. On his next basic attack on a stunned enemy, Einar punches the stunned target knocking them back for 450 units, but also applies a secondary stun that lasts for 2 seconds. If the knockback target hits an opponent, the enemies are dealt 20 to 50 (+ 10% AD) and slow them for 50% for 1 second. (Decays at 2 seconds, when out of combat.)\n\nMarksman:\nEinar deactivates his Melee form, then activates his dual hextech-guns. Increasing his AA range to 375 units.\n\nMain Effect:\n45% to 75% of Einar&rsquo;s Armor and Magic resist is turned into AD and AP. (Can&rsquo;t go under 65 Armor and 55 Magic resist if Einar can&rsquo;t reach 45% or 75% Einar just gain 5 to 40 adaptive damage.)\n\nExtra Effects:\nEinar&rsquo;s next basic attack does increase 10% extra damage.\n\nThe cooldown on both abilities are 30 to 10 seconds and cost 80 to 0 mana.\n\n**E - Leap / Grappling Hook:**\nLeap: \nJump to a target location. Einar smashes his shield at the ground, knocking up all enemies near the location. Dealing 60 - 120 (+ 25% AD).\n\nRange: 475 \nExtra Effects:\nIf an enemy champion was hit, Weapon Switches: Melee, second passive, activates and gives him the ability to stun an enemy regardless if it is his third basic attack. If Einar is under the Swirling Slash channel, he can still activate Leap.\n\nGrappling Hook:\nEinar fires a hook, if the hook hit a wall he pulls himself towards that wall. If the hook hits an enemy, he pulls the enemy towards him for half of their distance, slowing them for 40% to 90% for 1.5 seconds. Dealing 20 to 40 (+ 10% AD).\n\nRange: 575 units.\n\nExtra effects:\nEinar can throw himself further by 300 units if reactivating his Grappling Hook. Can go over walls. But can&rsquo;t damage enemies.\n\nSecond effect if an enemy was hit:\nWhen an enemy was grasped by Grappling Hook, Einar can activate energy projectile pulling the enemy all the way towards him. Then shotes two shots directly at the enemy, applying knockback on the enemy champion for 300 units, slowing them for 20% for 2 seconds, dealing 200 (+ 60% to 120% AD [Depending on Energy Projectiles Level]) damage. \n(Energy Projectile goes on cooldown.) You have 1 seconds to cast Energy Projectile. Energy Projectile can be activated mid-flight. If the hook misses energy projectile doesn&rsquo;t go on cooldown or uses mana.\n\nThird effect if an enemy was hit:\nEinar can recast Grappling Hook, if Grappling Hook hits another enemy they are pulled together and stunned for 1 seconds. If the Hook hits a wall, the enemy is flung back to the hooked wall and stunned for 1 second. You have 1 seconds to connect the hooks. You can reactivate Grappling Hook mid-flight. \n\nThe cooldown on both abilities are 15 to 10 seconds and cost 55 mana.\n\n**R - Star Buster:**\nEinar takes his energy rifle from his back and charges it up. He can channel it for 5 seconds to make the energy bullet stronger. It takes Einar 1 second to aim and shot it, the energy shot will reach its target location in 3 seconds. Star Buster will send out a massive cone of shockwaves, that does decreased damage.\n\nStar Buster power:\nDeals 500 to 1000 damage. Under channel, the AD or AP % scaling is increased by every second going from a ( + 150% to 200% AD) to ( + 450% to 600% AD) or (+ 20% to 40% AP) to ( + 60% to 120% AP) depending on how long the ability was channeled. When hitting a champion or minion the projectile will send a massive cone blast of decreased damage up to an 80% reduced damage to enemy champions, and 40% damage decrease on enemy units.\n\nExtra effects:\nIf Einar was stunned, the channel is not canceled. All enemies hit behind the blast are stunned for 1 second. When Star Buster has reached 2000 units, minions or monsters cannot be hit by the ability. If an enemy is below 20% of their max health, the damage will triple and is true damage. If the Star Buster is fully charged, a champion hit with a shield passive has their passive shield negated. (Item shields are not affected and can negate 50% to 20% of the damage.)\n\nWeakness:\nThe ability can be interrupted by knock ups, knockbacks, or silences. Einar can hold the energy charge for a max 10 seconds. The radius of the ability is 20 units. Einar is not mobile under the channel. If an enemy has an item shield 50% to 20% of that damage is negated by the shield. It can only scale from one source, if you own more AD it will scale with its AD and reversed. While Einar is 3 seconds into the channeling, he is visible to the enemy.\n\nRange: \nWhen shot it has the range of a unit of 75% the map.\n\nSound effects:\nWhen the Star Buster Projectile has been shot the boom from the shockwave can be heard and if it hits a target. (This sound effect is only heard on a 3 second or over Ult)\n\nMana and cooldown:\nThe ability cost 100 mana at all ranks. The cooldown is 1 minute and 40 seconds at all ranks, this cooldown is not affected by cooldown reduction.\n\nHey guys, thanks for reading. I&#039;m still working on the lore, but I want it as clean and edited as possible. So the full lore may not be out for some time, but this lore is coming out for reals. I have already spent half of my spring break coming up with ideas, I also got some good editors as well, so this should be good.","replies":[]}
