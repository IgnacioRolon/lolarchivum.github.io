I tried it, it awful, don&#039;t do it. \r\n\r\nThe movement speed buff is good, but I would rather have it as a part of her Passive: Harrier. Instead of her W, also so I don&#039;t have to max the W, for so, little. It&#039;s even ineffective mid to late, unless if you max it first and sacrifice important, damage.\r\nThe attack speed buff is hardly noticeable and is useless for a champion that&#039;s built and built like an assassin. Her Harrier is already doing the fast combo thing for Quinn, so there is no way to utilize the attack speed. \r\n\r\nQuinn&#039;s kit, isn&#039;t, badly designed, it&#039;s because she has an ADC ability in an assassin kit. If Quinn&#039;s W worked like a stealth ability and a vision ability, it would be much better. \r\n\r\nQuinn doesn&#039;t need a major, rework, maybe a visual update. But, that&#039;s personal opinion. The W is the only thing in her kit I would like to see changed. I still want the vision though.\r\n\r\nMy idea for the W change: \r\n\r\n(W) Heightened Senses - Active: Quinn orders valor, to reveal the area around her for 2 seconds.\r\nHiden Senses - Passive: If an enemy, was revealed, Quinn cloaks herself and gains 30-60% Movement Speed for 4 seconds.","replies":[{"poster":"RÃ¼digersKapriole","date":"2018-07-26T18:08:35.421+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"1) w max first is actually part of a certain build and pretty good vs tanks (mains community agrees on this)  \n  \n2) please stop with the cloaking spells.. even more invisibility is more toxic than healthy for the game  \n  \n3) the AS is pretty important tbh, and it (+e) is part of why she doesnt get shit on by every single melee in toplane","replies":[]},{"poster":"Beatrice falls","date":"2018-07-26T20:49:51.501+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Her W makes sense thematically, she's a roamer.
