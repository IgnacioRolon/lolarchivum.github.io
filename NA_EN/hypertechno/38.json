Now its all over from 20 - 140 FPS.\r\n\r\nI just wanted to ask the community and RIoters if it is my computer or if there is something up with the client. Because this just recently starting to happen, and my computer has been able to keep that quality from season 5 till recently.\r\n\r\nPlz, help.\r\n\r\nGL HF\r\n\r\n{{sticker:vlad-salute}}","replies":[{"poster":"Nullstar","date":"2018-12-11T22:58:17.118+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you tried capping your FPS?
