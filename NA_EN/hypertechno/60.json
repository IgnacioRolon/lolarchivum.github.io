In that sense, I expect Quinn to be a jungle/ADC ambusher. Her original and current kit hits the point, to an extent. (R) Quinn's, Skystrike, comes off to me as odd, both as in gameplay, style, and story. This is a game, nothing is intended to be realistic, you have a mountain that moves, talks, and has a charge Ult. Yet, it makes more sense than seeing arrows seemingly out nowhere coming raining down from the sky, when neither Quinn or Valor is above the sky. In my previous Quinn concept, I foolishly renamed Skystrike to Vault, as my past remake of Vault replaced the old Skystrike. Behind Enemy Lines remains the same, though Skystrike is changed to something that resembles the \"throw me behind enemy lines\" attitude. Quinn can now be thrown behind an enemy or line. (E) I should never have tried to replace Vault, it is a great ability, it lines well with her gameplay, style, and story. What has been done is an expansion to Quinn's E. Ready Aim is the expansion to her E and is not entirely new, but is unique to Quinn. Ready Aim comes from her lore, \"With her father's help, she crafted a new weapon from the horns of the tuskvore, a finely-wrought repeater crossbow capable of firing multiple bolts with a single pull of the trigger.\" Taking the amount current Harrier would fire (three bolts). This alines with her ADC core some people want Quinn to have. This gives room for her Vault though as in, when I chase you, under Behind Enemy Lines, I want to catch you. Imagine a horse rider catching an animal, but a person flying, hold up by a huge bird. Some will see this as a removal of Quinn's Vault, in that case, I added something fun to Quinn's passive. (Passive) This one has undergone many changes during many of my concepts, some favorable, some not so much. Like my, Quinn switching places with Valor, when Quinn dies. A hated idea. Yet this time, I may have found a balance in my expectations and the community expectation. Harrier, in my previous concept post, was changed to Valor's Preying Eye, misunderstanding the meaning Harrier. Harrier acts much like the current Harrier, except, it empowers her abilities with their own unique effect when used on them, or at them. Riot originally intended to make Quinn an ADC/melee fighter. When Quinn was first released Tag Team (2013 Quinn Ult) made Quinn switch with Valor, who was melee. I expanded on the idea, and instead of reverting Behind Enemy Lines back in my concept, I added a melee function to Quinn's passive. This is Crossbow/Demacian Sword, under this passive Quinn has ammo. What is unique to Quinn, unlike Graves and Jhin, when she runs out, Quinn can choose to fight but as a melee range champion, or run to reload. When melee, Quinn has access to all of her abilities but Ready Aim. Because of that, players get access to the Vault. (W) Quinn, as a hunter, might prefer to scan an area, yet not just around her but out father away. Quinn's, Heightened Senses, do justice to the idea but yet at the same time not. Many ideas from me have been laid out when it comes to Heightened Senses, but most fail to reach satisfactory, in the case, I stuck to the old idea but loosened it up. As I keep making it overpowered. (Q) When it comes to her Q, this variation has stuck out as the most popular, I have nothing much to say about it other than it follows the same principle, but functions like a Victor E.\n\nhttps://images-wixmp-ed30a86b8c4ca887773594c2.wixmp.com/f/166c17bf-746a-459d-8c47-727ccdf5daf3/d71bw54-037e466c-3976-45d7-a490-72142e3166ec.png/v1/fill/w_1024,h_576,q_80,strp/quinn_and_valor_wallpaper_by_prodigioushd_d71bw54-fullview.jpg?token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJ1cm46YXBwOjdlMGQxODg5ODIyNjQzNzNhNWYwZDQxNWVhMGQyNmUwIiwiaXNzIjoidXJuOmFwcDo3ZTBkMTg4OTgyMjY0MzczYTVmMGQ0MTVlYTBkMjZlMCIsIm9iaiI6W1t7ImhlaWdodCI6Ijw9NTc2IiwicGF0aCI6IlwvZlwvMTY2YzE3YmYtNzQ2YS00NTlkLThjNDctNzI3Y2NkZjVkYWYzXC9kNzFidzU0LTAzN2U0NjZjLTM5NzYtNDVkNy1hNDkwLTcyMTQyZTMxNjZlYy5wbmciLCJ3aWR0aCI6Ijw9MTAyNCJ9XV0sImF1ZCI6WyJ1cm46c2VydmljZTppbWFnZS5vcGVyYXRpb25zIl19.wvFBatHTArBSPcj646041uJh1rd-KBaDCG7PeIyCddY\n\nTheme:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2b1NGqPa2q0\n \n> (Automatic) Passive - Harrier [Range: 2000; nearest to Quinn, Mana: 0, Cooldown: 45]: Valor in the air selects the lowest health visible enemy unit as vulnerable, or the first target hit by Diving Assault, revealing them for 4 seconds. Minions or monsters outside a radius of 1000 cannot be targeted by Harrier. Heightened Senses, Ready Aim/Vault, Behind Enemy Lines/Skystrike can consume the mark empowering them.\n>\n> (Automatic) Passive - Crossbow/Demacian Sword [Range: 525, Mana: 0, Cooldown: 0]: Quinn's basic attack has 15 loaded arrows. When out of ammo, Quinn reloads her crossbow 2 seconds after not taking damage by an enemy champion (6-second reload delay, decreasing with attack speed [Max: 0.5 seconds]). When out ammo but fights an enemy champion or monster, Quinn switches to her melee weapon, increasing her Attack Speed by 10-80% (Depending on Level), and gains 6-20 Attack Damage (Depending on Level).\n\n|\n\n> (Active) Q - Diving Assault [Range: 1000 within 2000, Mana: 50-80, Cooldown: 20 (8 seconds)]: Quinn signals Valor to dive and fly 1000 units down the target path. Valor stops at the first target hit dealing 15/30/50/80/160 (+ 70/75/80/90/100% AD) physical damage, applying nearsighted for 1.5 seconds. Valor can dive in any direction from any point within range, and he does not interrupt Quinn's previous orders. Quinn can catch Valor mid-flight. If grabbed, Quinn launches Valor in a straight line of 1200, stopping at the first target hit, dealing 20% bonus damage, slowing the enemy by 40% for 1 second. If Valor hits a unit, Diving Assault's cooldown is reduced by 60%. \n>\n> If Diving Assault is used when Behind Enemy Lines is active, Valor drops Quinn and flies in a straight line of 1200, stopping at the first target hit dealing 15/30/50/80/160 (+ 50/55/60/70/80% AD) physical damage.\n>\n> Non-champion targets are disarmed instead of the duration.\n\n|\n\n> (Active) W - Heightened Senses [Range: 1000, Mana: 0, Cooldown: 50-30]: Quinn signals Valor to reveal target area of 1800-2400 within the range of 2000 for 1 second.\n>\n> Using Heightened Senses during Behind Enemy Lines reveals the area around Quinn.\n>\n> Empowered Heightened Senses [Within Range: 675]: Valor shrieks if Heightened Senses is used near a vulnerable target, slowing that unit by 20% for 1.5 seconds. \n>\n> Revealing an unseen champion will mark them vulnerable.\n> \n> Non-champion targets are feared for the duration\n\n|\n\n> (First Active) E - Ready Aim [Range: 525, Mana: 40, Cooldown: 12-8]: Quinn channels for 0.5 seconds. For 2 seconds, Quinn slows down for 30%-0%, auto fires 3 shots per 1 second [Max: 6-12] (decreasing with attack speed [Max: 0.5 seconds]) locked on target. All three arrows equal the amount of damage, three basic attacks would. If Quinn runs out of ammo, she instantly reloads (0.5-second delay).\n\n> Empowered Ready Aim: Quinn increases her movement speed by 50% when using Ready Aim on a vulnerable unit. \n\n> Ready Aim becomes Vault when Quinn is in melee or has Behind Enemy Lines active. \n\n> (Second Active) E - Vault [Range: 675, Mana: 40, Cooldown: 12-8]: Quinn dashes to the target unit,  knocking them back, dealing 40/70/100/130/ 160 (+ 20% AD) physical damage, and slowing them by 50% which decays over 1.5 seconds, before leaping back and landing 525 units away from them.\n\n> Empowered Vault: Increases slow strength from 50% to 80% when using Vault on a vulnerable unit.\n\n> Using Vault will when Behind Enemy Lines will detach Quinn from Valor.\n\n|\n\n> (First Active) R - Behind Enemy Lines [Range: 0, Mana: 100-25, Cooldown: 0]: Quinn channels for 2 seconds. Upon completing it successfully, Valor picks Quinn up. Quinn gains a burst of movement speed by 200% for 0.5 seconds, then increasing her total movement speed by 70%/130% and gaining the ability to activate Skystrike.\n>\n> Suffering immobilizing crowd control effects while Behind Enemy Lines is channeling cancels it. Taking damage from champions, monsters, or turrets while Behind Enemy Lines is active removes the bonus movement speed for 3 seconds.\n>\n> If you have at least one point in Behind Enemy Lines, respawning or returning to the summoning platform will spawn Valor.\n>\n> Empowered Behind Enemy Lines: Moving towards a Vulnerable target will increase Quinn's movement speed by 40%.\n\n> (Second Active) R - Skystrike [Range: 750, Mana: 0, Cooldown: 0]: Quinn dashes in the target direction, dealing 20-155((+ 20% AD) increased by 10%-15%(Max: 60%-100%) per 100 movement speed) physical damage, and slowing all enemy hit by 40% for 1.5 seconds. Quinn will not lose her bonus movement speed from Behind Enemy Lines but will exit Behind Enemy Lines, and keep the bonus movement speed for 0.5 seconds after the dash.\n\n> Empowered Skystrike: Hitting a vulnerable unit will fear it for 0.5 seconds.","replies":[]}
