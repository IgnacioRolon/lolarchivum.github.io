He was tasked to be the protector of the Sun Disk, and share its power, only, to the once the disk saw worthy. Ramesh started with the person he trusted the most, his brother. The Sun Disk saw a worthy man, a man of strong will, and a heart of gold. Ramesh&#039;s brother became the second Ascendant, his task was to rule Shurima and form the greatest empire. As the years went by, Ramesh wasn&#039;t any older, but his brother was wasting away. However, was the ruler of a powerful empire. Ramesh knew it was almost the time for his brother to go. \nThen one night, Ramesh asked the Sun Disk about his powers, and it began to teach Ramesh about his powers. In shock, he ran to his brother, but it was too late. His brother was poisoned by a snake bite and died minutes before Ramesh could arrive. If Ramesh hadn&#039;t left his brothers side, he would have been saved and turned young as he once was. \nRamesh is the ascendents of health and youth.\nIn shame, he put his brother&#039;s death on himself. He thought that if he had asked the Sun Disk about his powers, in the beginning, this would never have happened. As a punishment, he hanged himself alone far out from the city. There he was hanging, for years. \nAs Azir, again rose from his long sleep. So did Ramesh. As Azir rebuilds his father&#039;s city, the sand that covered Ramesh was blown away, losing him from the rope around his neck. Awaking from his long sleep, he now understood that he couldn&#039;t be killed. Still ashamed, he returned to the empire.\nWhen he neared the city, he could feel the Sun Disk, and it could feel him.\nAs he was walking the long road, the Sun Disk told him everything that had happened through the years of his immortal sleep. He wasn&#039;t pleased with the news and blamed himself for all the wrong that had happened. The Sun Disk then started to get pissed off by it's protector, and began to tell him that all the wrong could be fixed if he tried to fix it, and stopped crying. Ramesh finally lets his failures go, and learned from them. This time, he wasn&#039;t going to save Shurima, he was going to save the world.","replies":[{"poster":"Daedeye","date":"2018-07-07T20:10:36.036+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a support champion, he won't have much gold, so he will be a squishy melee fighter without an escape ability, other than his ultimate.\nMaybe you can give him either some mobility or another ability, that he can use from behind the lines?\nAlthough a constant movement speed buff with his ultimate seems interesting, he can still easily be locked down.\n\nQ:\nWhen allies are dead, your team will have to play more passively, than with living allies.

But, then you mentioned his gold problem as a support, so I'll fix that. I will also think of item builds, and for my next champion concepts to come.\n\nYeah, Hook is, very, ham. I will look into that.\n\nThe E scaling is quite easy to understand, if your the writer. His E is meant to be powerful, when alone, to help wave clear or solo if the ADC left or died. But weak with strong CC, when with the team. The passive \"Stay Down!\" is a reward passive. If you are able to stay with your full team, and do a E-BA combo you're rewarded with high damage and CC.\nThe E rewards you, and your team, for playing as a team. I'm thinking about giving it a gold bonus, nothing too much, around 50 gold.\n\nThe R can quickly be fixed. But, I want to keep the blind. I can see what I can do.","replies":[{"poster":"Daedeye","date":"2018-07-07T22:28:09.575+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thresh and even Nautilus have a long range hook. And most squishy supports are ranged champions, while most tanky supports are good at initiating.\n\nIf keeping the blind, I would also add a silence.\n\nI think, the champion is a good idea overall and his abilities scaling with nearby allies fit him well. He just has to find a specific purpose to have for his team.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ACupForTea","date":"2018-07-07T12:22:33.657+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pretty interesting, a melee damage support that's not an assassin like Pyke. I feel like he's very lvl 6 oriented with an ult like that. But the early cheese potential if the enemy step out of line is also quite good! And lore wise he's interesting, though idk much about Shuriman lore to say if it fits or not, but its seems to xD. Also his special passive is cool, may make Azir botlane viable (sorta)!\n\n(Also if you wanna you can check out my support champ concept on the other end of the damage spectrum https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/q4oOEUEh-support-champion-concept-aleira-guardian-of-the-weak-ioniannoxian-support.
