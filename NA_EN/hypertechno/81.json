Dianna Vader - Basically how it sounds like.\r\n2. Chewbaccakong (Wukong)\r\n3. Boba Vayne\r\n4. Yasuo Dooku\r\n5. Fiora Kenobi\r\n6. Trooper Jhin\r\n7. Yoda Gnar\r\n8. Skywalker Riven\r\n\r\nWeird skins ideas:\r\nThis one is just for some really confusing concepts I came up with.\r\n1. Hana Quinn - Completly stupid, but why not. Valor is the millennium falcon and Quinn basically a female version of Han Solo.\r\n2. Jabba Ornn - Hehe, I would love that.\r\n3. Kylo Kassadin - Just because his void sword looks like his. Meh.\r\n4. Leia Caitlyn - Hm, would be odd.\r\n\r\nLET ME HEAR YOU! GIVE ME YOU FUNNIEST STAR WARS SKIN IDEA!
