{"poster":"HyperTechno","date":"2019-09-12T22:03:37.365+0000","title":"What happened to the Demacian lore?","subforum":"General Discussion","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have a problem with the new additions to the Demacian lore, mainly all of the Lux comic and Sylas' lore. Both bring giant plot holes or even contradiction to its original origin.  \n\nLux's comic is flawed. It is off-putting on Riot's original Demacian lore by making a big mess with the story's entirety, including some Demacian champions. Jarvan IV went rampant on mages, which makes no sense when comparing his lore. He is a general who has faced numerous battles, trained with a diverse group of people, seen hell, meet a dragon - which saved him, mind you -, etc. Jarvan is one of the many examples of the writer taking no time in fact-checking his work, and messing up the timelines. \n\nSylas would be the origin of this Demacain lore mess. According to Riot's Demacian lore, and how petricite function, Sylas' magic should not be functional. We know that his chamber is covert in petricite from top to bottom, and the walls are cramped. Even if we say the bark weakened because they removed it from the tree, it makes a slim change to the outcome. I can understand the citizens; the walls are made by the same material, and if we say the bark does not weaken when separated from the tree, we have to take account that the people walking around the city do not have the walls cramped against them from all directions and on their arms. I would rather say it fatigue them - like Ryze in the petricite forest  - when exposed to it, for long periods - suggesting that mages may prefer living out on the felts as farmers.\n\n> Before you say, \"If Ryze can withstand it, why can't Sylas.\" Because their power scale is far from each other, and I mean extensively. Ryze has lived, studied, and trained for a greater length, not to mention hold the world runes. Do not compare the two, Ryze is the only mage, I would name, that could successfully destroy Demacia with magic - if he so wanted too. \n\nLux should also be incapable of using magic, when close to Sylas' chamber. Next up, there a better way to explain Sylas' buff appearance. \"As Sylas was freed, Lux hide him from the mageseekers, careful about his fragile body as they went through the secret tunnels, carved out by the mages of the military to keep themselves from the mageseekers in the past. At the edge of the forest, Lux left him, returning to her post... As Sylas retuned to Demacia, he was now ready, for three months he has prepared his body, mind, and soul for the day of judgment on the wrongs of Demacia.\" or something like it.\n\nThis probably does not matter, Riot, nor the community, cares. But if Riot does care, and the community agrees, here are two options I will give.\n\n1. Rewrite Sylas lore, and remake Lux's comic.\n\nor\n\n2. Completly change the Demacian lore, which means a change in, Galio's, Lucian's, Jarvan's, Shyvanna's, Garen's, Lux's, Xin's, Sona's, Quinn's, Ryze's, etc's. lore. To fit the new narrative.\n\nI want to say there is a grey option, but it is simply imposable with how everything is written. I will not guarantee it, but I may work on a Sylas lore, as my hobby is writing, fixing the problems, I see, in his lore. The Lux comic can only be trashed, sorry to say it, but everything does not hold up to the current lore. Sylas has some few mistakes that are easy to tweak and fix, while the comic is just a mistake on its own. I hate to be this, \"I think this is trash.\" Because there is always value in something, but the comic is just out of order with the timeline and is not fact-checked by Riots storytellers. It is a shame, I like the art and the story they want to tell.\n\nHope no one is offended, this post is not about offending others who enjoy them. But, I wanted to give feedback as a creator myself. Thanks for reading. Oh, and if you read something wrong about anything I wrote, inform me, and I will make an edit or even take the post down. \n\nBye.\n\n{{sticker:vlad-salute}}","replies":[]}
