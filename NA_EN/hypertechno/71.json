No, Riot should not stop supporting Pros or Asian, that will be as counterintuitive as the other. However, this game is not all Asians and Pros, there is an average player base, but Riot continues to refuse a middle ground. Especially during LCS season. This does not only lead to terrible business decisions, but it can also ruin otherwise balance champions that needed compensation changes over maintaining changes, like Ryze, Sylas, Zoe, Akali, Irelia, Azir, Galio, Kayle, Jayce, Neeko, and Ezreal. (To learn about my Maintain or Compensation Rules, here is a link to the post: https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/general-discussion/7RuhsTTu-my-two-balancing-rules-maintain-or-compensation )\r\nNot only is Riot limiting its support, but they will not fix a problem with the community or solve it. Instead of asking harmless questions as why-and-how or answer it like here-and-why, they say \"F off\" or \"Your opinion sucks\". Which has been evident with how they act on Twitter, instead of coming to a solution they are making it worse.\r\n\r\n2) Lazy Balancing Team:\r\nThe second most important position in an ever-changing game, but also the most logic-based position. A balancing team member must value facts and numbers over their second-hand unimportant opinions and feelings. As harsh as I may sound, because of their importance, their pay should be the lowest of all positions if a meta lost players, but increased by the success rate of metas or increase of players.\r\nAt the moment, most changes to champions are unimportant or could be fixed with Compensation, instead of maintaining changes. They do look at numbers, but they do not value a logic-based position. They have to evaluate a valuable approach that benefits both the lower and top end, never one or the other. Change proposals like those can take weeks and will take a month or so to polish, test, and to be accepted. Instead, we get willy-nilly kinda silly changes, that are unhealthy and unneeded or unimportant.\r\n\r\n3) Politics Became Too Important:\r\nAs much I would want to dodge this, this is important, but I want to make it short and keep my opinions out. Entertainment is there to entertain, not to force political opinions or hatred towards the audience. Sadly, it has spread like a virus throughout, not just Riot, but lots of other entertainment companies. It is also bad for business because no one gives a flying bird about political ideas during the entertainment.\r\n\r\n4) Toxic Community:\r\nYes, I am a part of it too, do not get on your high horse there buddy. Twitter, Reddit, and Board, though the Board has gotten way better, encourage too much of unneeded behavior like example number 2: Lazy Balancing Team and 3: Politics Became Too Important. First off, many people fight over rather dumb things like the V on Kai'Sa's chest, and so and so is broken with no true argument or support other than they got beaten by the champion. \r\n\r\n5) No Dare Devils:\r\nAs much as people will hate me for saying this, there is a need for people like CT, even if a design is broken or not. Designers have become too afraid of public hatred, and would rather copy and have few tweaks here and there. Where are the champions like Taliyah, Yoric, Galio, Zoe, Irelia, Riven, Yasuo, Anivia, Ziggs, Zed, and Akali? Reworks or champions like Kayle, Neeko, Sylas, and Akali are good but needed more oomph and should be broken on release, to find the optimal balance decisions.\r\n\r\n6) Overcompetitive:\r\nI am a competitive person, but I like to have fun and troll around at times. But because of the competitive scene, the overall encouragement from Riot about having fun is almost dead. Riot is not encouraging fun games for the average player or Pros. Confirmed by my College League buddy. \"Yes, you are paid, the overall experience sucks though. I would rather work as a garbageman than being a College League pro...\"\r\nThat is a bold statement, even for a person who loves playing League of Legends and in the Pro scene.\r\n\r\nHere are my six reasons not to play league. You may agree or disagree. If there is anything violating the rules, please, let me know and I will fix it or change it. This post is here to address frustration, flaws, and some solutions for Riot to make them improve.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nGL HF\r\n\r\n{{sticker:vlad-salute}}","replies":[]}
