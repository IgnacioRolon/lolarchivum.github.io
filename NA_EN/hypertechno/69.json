But damn is Riot good at making me want to play champions I hate. The skin looks beautiful, I would suggest some better lighting and coloring here and there though but that&#039;s up to RIot.\r\nOverall, I think it looks great. Is it a skin I would buy? No. Is it something an Illaoi main should buy, you will get what you deserve from the skin. So yes.\r\nI cannot wait until its live on the PBE server, so I can give some more feedback. I really think that Riot took the right direction when they involved the community in the skin development. The community gets what they want, and Riot makes more money off it.\r\nA job well is done. Looking forward to what you have in store for the next skins you involve the community in.","replies":[]}
