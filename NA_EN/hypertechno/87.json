I hate League, and I will never play it again - unless satisfied. But that does not mean ideas are irrelevant any less.\n\nHere is the fun, but somewhat fitting addition to Sion's ultimate, written in words. Yay, reading, no visuals or any of that boring stuff; aren't you lucky.\n\nI imagined Sion, running, but as he hits an enemy champion he grabs them by the throat to either slam them to the ground doing a small amount of damage while slowing them; or ram them into a wall doing a larger amount of damage while stunning them. I find it quite fitting for Sion, and may even give him more options or viability without giving him F load of damage. But the rest is up to you, what you think. \n\nFrom your raging troll, \nHyperTechno\n\n{{sticker:vlad-salute}}","replies":[{"poster":"The Ecdysiast","date":"2019-08-07T18:01:06.609+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They would need to do a separate animation for every single interaction, AND reduce it from an AoE to a single target. No way.","replies":[{"poster":"HyperTechno","date":"2019-08-07T18:20:02.583+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They would not be required to make it into a single target if Sion slams them to the ground, maybe if it is towards the wall, of course, it may be better there. Even then, I do not see it as a requirement to remove his AoE. If they have to, may I ask why?\n\nBut if they were to do my idea, there will be a need for separate animations, however, that would be a minor problem for Riot.\n\nAnyways, thanks for the comment.","replies":[{"poster":"The Ecdysiast","date":"2019-08-07T22:25:10.704+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But that's what he does already. He slams the ground at the end of the run. \n\nAs for why they'd need to remove the AoE if they add a choke and slam, it'd just be too powerful an ability if it could still pop people AoE but also plays a choking animation that's long enough to see.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
