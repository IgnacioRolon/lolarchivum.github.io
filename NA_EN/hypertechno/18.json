Be fair to everyone.)\r\n\r\n8.11 is a big patch, probably, out of all this year&#039;s changes. I like the idea of making ADC&#039;s stronger against tanks, but they are doing it wrong. \r\n\r\nInfinity Edge should not be doing True Damage, for each critical strike. It will be too powerful of an item to be considered fair. Champions like Yi, Yasuo, Trynd, and champions alike will become godly op. My suggestion is, make that part of the Infinity Edge only available for ADC&#039;s. Conquer but for ADC&#039;s, but as an item.\r\n\r\nEssence Reaver will be way too good on Yi. Pop ult and never get hit by anything when you head smash your Q button. Honestly, change Essences Reaver completely.\r\n\r\nEssence Reaver:\r\n+70 AD to +80 AD\r\n+10% CDR\r\n+20% CSC to 0% CSC\r\nNew: 10% LS\r\n\r\nUNIQUE Passive - Merciless (Marksman Only): Killing a champion or 10 minions will stack this item. Each stack, will grand 1 AD and the next basic attack, every 15 seconds, will deal 20 (+5 for each stack) True Damage.\r\nStack to a max of 20.\r\n\r\nUNIQUE Passive: 5% of Life Steal also restores your mana or energy.\r\n\r\nB. F. Sword + Caulfield&#039;s Warhammer + Vampiric Scepter + 300 Gold \r\nTotal Cost: 3,600\r\n\r\nI do not want Cloak of Agility to go, so, I made these two items.\r\n\r\nFirst Item:\r\nSuchos Cloak:\r\n20% Critical Strike Chance\r\n250 Mana\r\n\r\nUNIQUE Passive - Awe: Grants bonus Critical Strick Chance equal to 2% of maximum Mana. Refunds 15% of Mana spent.\r\nUNIQUE Passive - Mana Charge: Grants +5 maximum Mana (max +750 Mana) for each basic attack or Mana expenditure (occurs up to 3 times every 12 seconds).\r\n\r\nTransforms into Suchos War Cloak at +750 Mana.\r\n\r\nTires of a Goddess + Cloak of Agility + 1050 Gold\r\nTotal Cost: 2,700\r\n|\r\nSuchos War Cloak:\r\n+20% Critical Strike Chance\r\n1000 Mana\r\n\r\nUNIQUE Passive - Awe: Grants bonus Critical Strick Chance equal to 2% of maximum Mana. Refunds 15% of Mana spent.\r\nUNIQUE Passive - Cruelty: Critical hits against champions consume 3% current mana to deal 6% current mana bonus True Damage. This effect only activates while you have greater than 20% maximum mana.\r\n\r\nSecond Item: \r\nBerserker&#039;s Armor:\r\n+20% Critical Strike Chance\r\n+400 Health\r\n+60 Armor\r\n\r\nUNIQUE Passive - Barbaric Essence: Gain 40% Movement Speed towards champions.\r\nUNIQUE Active - Barbaric Strenght: Gain 5% (+5% per 20% of Critical Strick Chance) damage reduction for 3 seconds.\r\n\r\nChain Vest + Giant&#039;s Belt + Cloak of Agility + 1020 Gold\r\nTotal Cost: 3,000\r\n\r\nThat&#039;s my thought and ideas, what do you think.\r\n\r\nGL HF \r\n{{sticker:vlad-salute}}","replies":[{"poster":"ankoanko19","date":"2018-05-12T23:04:14.148+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so what will they compensate yi, yas or trynd then?","replies":[{"poster":"HyperTechno","date":"2018-05-12T23:37:50.470+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"None of the champions requires a change.

It might be due to my playstyle but I believe crit should be less and less of a common thing. I think that is exactly what Riot is aiming with their changes while these changes seem to encourage crit if any (especially on champs like quinn or jayce).\n\nYou misunderstood what i meant, since IEs passive wont work on melee, what exactly should they do with these 2 melee champions that rely on that item?","replies":[{"poster":"HyperTechno","date":"2018-05-13T02:13:25.030+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That does make sense. So I got an idea, why not just make a True Damage passive be for Marksman only, and one more passive for the melee champions.\n\nInfinity Edge\nLike this:\n+80 AD\n\nUNIQUE Passive - Doubles your Critical Strike Chance.\n(Marksman Only) UNIQUE Passive - Sharpened Edge: 20% of Critical Strike Damage dealt, to champions, is converted to True Damage.\n(Melee Only) UNIQUE Passive - Infinite Power: Gain 10% Critical Strike Chance, and your Critical Strike Damage is increased, by 20%.\n\nThat would be my proposal.\n\nI also took the time to make a melee only for Essence Reaver as well.\n\nEssence Reaver: \n+80 AD\n+10% CDR\n+10% Life Steal\n\nUNIQUE Passive - Merciless (Marksman Only): Killing a champion, a large monster, or 15 minions will stack this item. Each stack, will grand 1 AD and the next basic attack, every 15 seconds, will deal 20 (+5 for each stack) True Damage.\nStack to a max of 20.\nUNIQUE Passive - Reaping (Melee Only): First attack on champions will deal an extra 1% - 5% (Depending on Level) of their missing health as damage. Healing for 30% of damage dealt.\n30-second cooldown.\n\nUNIQUE Passive: 5% of Life Steal also restores your mana or energy.\n\nI also made a change to Berserker's Armor.\n\nBerserker's Armor:\n+15 AD\n+600 Health\n+60 Armor\n\nUNIQUE Passive - Barbaric Essence: Gain 40% Movement Speed towards champions.\nUNIQUE Active - Barbaric Strenght: Gain 5% (+5% per 100 Armor or Magic Resist, whichever has more) damage reduction for 3 seconds.\n\nChain Vest + Giant's Belt + Phage + 50 Gold\nTotal Cost: 3,100\n\nI hope I got it right. But, tell me what you think.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
