Supports would pick it up, and I love using it with Leona, Rakan, or Sona. However, would love to use it more on other roles. As in, pick it for a mid tank lane champion. Galio, Vlad, Swain, or any champion top or mid, that could make use of it, to improve their teamwork ability.\r\nBut, I was not sure if everyone felt the same, so want to ask you all. What is your opinion on Font Of Life?","replies":[]}
