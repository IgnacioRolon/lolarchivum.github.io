(Champion Concept)","subforum":"Concepts & Creations","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Anymilia, Demacias Blaze.\nType: Fighter, Mage\nDifficulty: Very Hard (This champion, if made, will take many games to play.)\n\nAnymilia&#039;s look: https://i.redditmedia.com/1Gh-Encz_vAhVoORUnNqBVvZMxOEZ72NnnK4NgryzIs.jpg?s=3a855357fe9e5840df1ee35ee2b69f46\n\nI&#039;m getting inspiration on her kit from Erza, and Natsu (Fairy Tail), Brand, Riven, and Udyr. Anymilia will have four transformations. Each transformation has its own four unique techniques.\n\nAnymilia is an orphan, who is hot-headed, but warm-hearted. She was trained by a mage named Ambert who lives on the far outside of Demacias&#039; Walls to hide from Demacia and Noxus. There she learned to control and expand her fire magic.\n\nAnymilia likes to show off. She always wants to look beautiful in battle. \n\nThough she wasn&#039;t well respected in the Demacian kingdom, Queen Quinn (It&#039;s connected to my storyline, Quinn does not become Queen, in Riot&#039;s lore) made her acceptable to the people of Demacia. (Anymilia is the only Mage allowed through Demacias walls, and though Quinn want&#039;s to make Lux&#039;s magic acceptable, she is afraid Garen will take it the wrong way. Lux has to tell her family by herself.) Anymilia had become a royal name in Demacia, and her acceptability as a mage has grown. Soon Lux&#039;s name can be freed from hatred of magic and she can show her country the beauty of magic.\n\nPersonality:\nAnymilia can only control her fire magic by staying calm, and positive. Thanks to her training, she has learned to be optimistic and calm. However, Ambert was afraid of her losing her brain and become ditzy, so he made her study everything she needed to know about everything (Yes, he went overboard, she had to learn everything from a young age, with no break). As she grew up, so did her intelligence and creativity. She could read a map without one, she could calculate the hardest equations within seconds, and she knew everything from the political views of Demacia, Noxius, and so on. It was like he made her into the perfect being. Nothing could be further from the truth, though she was the most intelligent and calmest person, an anger issue formed under the perfect image.\n(This isn&#039;t her lore, her lore will explain more about her. However, her lore has to wait until I release, No Hero Lives Forever; Quinn&#039;s Tale.)\n\nPower:\nAnymilia&#039;s power is called Dragon Magic. Dragon Magic is born with, if perfected, can destroy whoever dares to come in their way. Humans, Dragons, Demons, Gods, Voidlings, and even the powerful Darkins. Only two in history manage to control or tame their magical powers. \nThe rules to perfect their powers is to accept their imperfections and anger. Else, the power will consume them and turn them into a beast of uncontrollable rage, and they will be human no longer. \nHowever, before the consumption of their soul, they will be sent into a trance of power, called the Dragon Rage. Under Dragon Rage the soul of the body can still fight, to take back full control. They are the biggest threat, if they are in battle, they will charge with no mercy.\nThere three scenarios that can happen under Dragon Rage. \n1. The soul wins and gains full control of their Dragon Magic.\n2. The soul wins, but won&#039;t gain control of their Dragon Magic.\n3. The soul is overwhelmed, and they transform into a raging Dragon.\n\nEven if the mage doesn&#039;t have full control, they are powerful beings and can do things other fire mages can&#039;t. For example, manipulating flames to create iron and other forms of metallic elements to any shape, for a short period if the mage isn&#039;t in contact with the metallic element. There more advanced techniques are the art of flame sculpting, any fire mage can learn it, but will never master it, unlike the Dragon Mages. Flame sculpting was an agent technique, formed during the Drakin War, by the Sun Tribe that almost died off during a brutal attack from an unstoppable Darkin. In their place, Demacia now stands.\n\nAnymilia&#039;s Theme:\nhttps://soundcloud.com/hypertechno/anymilias-theme\n\n(Transformation Rule: Anymilia is still mobile under transformation, and gains a 40% movement speed increase for 2 seconds when transforming back to her basic form, but can&#039;t attack.
