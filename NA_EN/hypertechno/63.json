Please do not ridicule or shame anyone for liking a designer. You may disagree with a person, that is fine.\r\n\r\nMy favorite designer would most likely be CertainlyT. Why? Most of his designs are game-changing, fun, and creative. I like the &quot;I do not care for what others say.&quot; attitude. Zoe, Yasuo, Akali, Warwick and most of his creations are unique. I have not seen a champion like Zoe, Yasuo, or new Akali in other MOBA games other than League of Legends.\r\nSadly, I do not see much of the credit he deserves, but he still makes champions that fits a unique style. I like him, and I think he does his job well.\r\n\r\nKeep up with the amazing work.\r\n\r\nI do not mind if you all dislike CT, not all of his designs are for everyone.\r\n\r\nWho is your favorite champion designer?","replies":[]}
