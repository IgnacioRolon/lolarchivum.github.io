Except splitting each other apart as a community. I am tired of seeing all the hate from the board, and I am tired of Riots constant dodging of others problems or questions by not responding or responding with excuses instead of answers.\r\n\r\n**Full version:**\r\nFrankly, this is a mixture of both the board and Riot Games Inc.\r\n\r\nWhat I do not like at the moment is when, the board complains about damage, but want ADC/APC that are damage carries, to be stronger earlier. Witch, in turn, will hurt Top and MId because now the ADC/APC can kill the champions that they counter and their counters a lot easier. Then Riot goes in and thinks it would be a good idea to buff ADC/APC which will bump up damage, which will then make tanks, bruisers, assassins, and mages useless. Then Riot has no choice but to buff those champions. If you cannot see where I am getting at, I will make it easy. \r\n\r\nWhen ADC/APC are strong, other roles must be stronger, which thereby increasing damage within the game. However, that is the least of my problems.\r\n\r\nAll the dumb point-click ranged champions. Oh boy, am I tired of being &quot;outplayed&quot; by a champion with a point-click ability. I stopped playing Dota for a reason you know. Tbh, League is not as unbalanced as many people want others to believe. It has its ups and downs, but never something crazy like the Galio buff from way back. But when it comes to champions like Vayne, Kai&#039;sa, Malzahar, MF, Ryze, Lucian, many more, it is a quick turnoff when playing the game, and when you have played against that shit, Irellia, Akali, Zoe, Neeko, and Yi look balanced and well designed. \r\n\r\n&quot;Kai&#039;sa is not a point-click champion.&quot; Really? \r\nQ - guided missiles. P-C\r\nW - skill shot\r\nE - fast and invisible as fuck, boy. P-C\r\nR - Hi, I came to kill you, FYI. P-C\r\n\r\nYeah, nice meme there. Thankfully Riot took action and gave her a proper nerf to her problematic Passive, which should no be doing Missing fucking Health Damage in the first place, which is somehow still there. Who the fuck made this shit? My sister could do better, and she does not make champion concepts like me.\r\n\r\nRiot, I do not give a shit which champion wants to smash who. What did it change in the game and in the story of Runeterra? Zero, same old nothing new. Let the fucking fan base do the sexual preference for you, instead of confirming someones smash preference. Then the champion can be, gay or straight, with no fight breaking out between sexist and some dumb trigger happy LGBTQ. I would much rather have quality over political correctness, even though I happen to agree that people should have the right to love whoever, but do not force the believe on others just because some LGBTQ person or group said so or vise versa. The same said about Feminism. Let politicians and the government handle that. Riot is a company, not a political party.\r\n\r\nStaying quiet can work, at times, but you must at some point talk to your community. Question and problem dodging at the moment are the worst you can do, people are desperate and need answers Riot. Giving them a straight, no, but with a reason can solve lots of problems, maybe even ask for solution or ideas. You may be professional designers, but as {{champion:11}}  puts it, &quot;A true master is an eternal student.&quot; and &quot;Do not let your pride blind you.&quot; and &quot;Anger gives motivation without purpose.&quot; \r\n\r\nI respect each and everyone who dislike, like, read, or did not read it at all. This post was made because of the hardship I face, all personal. It has become harder to stay respectful towards players, board OP&#039;s, and Rioters themselves. As much as I want to leave, there is no real way for me to leave. So instead of emerging with all the hatred, I want to fix it. But, even as am trying to fix it, I become toxic, opinionated, and rude. Just because, I know the board is not going to change, nor will RIot. We are stuck in this loop of anger, and I know we are just going to run into it again.\r\n\r\nI know I will be given many dislikes, from the community and Rioters. I know it is none of my business, but I am tired of seeing everyone and myself pointing fingers at each other and call fault instead of trying to be better or fix our problems. \r\n\r\nIf you have read til now, thank you, and sorry for wasting your time.\r\n\r\nGL HF","replies":[]}
