I understand the idea behind it. &quot;Hey, do not be a troll or you will lose more LP than normal.&quot; However, I would suggest increasing the LP loss per loss, rather than every game. Pre-season is almost over, so this I am sure will change, but it is an idea for pre-season 10. \r\n\r\nMy experience:\r\nGoing from a 61 LP to a 97 LP after two wins, all the way back to a 75 LP for one loss feels frustrating Riot. Because if I lose the next game, I could end up going down to 55 or 53 LP, losing 2 and a quarter of my LP gain progress.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I wanted it off my chest, nothing against Riot. You can hit the dislike, because not everyone agrees, which is understandable. If you have any thoughts please do not be afraid to write it, however, be friendly.","replies":[]}
