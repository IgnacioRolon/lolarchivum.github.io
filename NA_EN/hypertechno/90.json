I was about to pick her up, but she is now unplayable, and I mean unplayable.\n\nI would love to get old Taliyah back when she was a stable champion. Then keep an eye out for the person who suggested the changed, and take his words with a grain of salt. He clearly, messed her up more than fixed her. \n\nThere are already posts explaining the concern in better detail, I just want to confirm that I am onboard with reverting Taliyah&#039;s 8.11 changes.\n\nYou can agree or disagree.
