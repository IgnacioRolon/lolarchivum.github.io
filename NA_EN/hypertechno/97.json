{"poster":"HyperTechno","date":"2018-08-31T03:35:35.539+0000","title":"Queltra, the Reincarnated","subforum":"Concepts & Creations","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Name: Queltra, the Reincarnated\nSex: Female\nAge: 11\nRegion: Born by Targonianse, Orphinached in Noxus.\nType: Burst Control Mage\nStrength: High damage, immune to burst, versatile, sticky, and strong Ult.\nWeaknesses: Constant damage, CC (Without the ult), handicapped, tanks, and other sticky champions.\n\nCharacter inspired by Saga of Tanya the Evil, the story will be quite the same. However, her name is Queltra, and it&#039;s the League of Legends universe. (Honestly, read the book and manga. It&#039;s good.)\n\nhttps://d3ieicw58ybon5.cloudfront.net/full/u/3908886869f3481a992a39d8bef1f18a.jpg\n\nQueltra&#039;s Theme and Dance (Dance at 1:03, ends 1:26):\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxqjsXjSKPk\n\nThe login picture:\nhttp://www.bunnygo.net/images/20170208/20170208223200138.jpg\nLooking down at Queltra should be Zoe laughing joyously, with Queltra with a smile however with the same evil looking grin in the picture, and Queltra is trying to aim her gun at Zoe&#039;s head. They are both flying in the air at high speed, hence why Queltra has a hard chance at aiming her gun.\n\nAbility Theme:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROoalSB2DOM&amp;index=19&amp;list=RD_8BwHHEopec\n\n**(Passive) Blest Rune **- Passive: If Queltra was to be dealt more than 200-1000 (Depending on level) Physical or Magic damage, 20-35% (Depending on level) (+ 10% per 100 AP) of the damage dealt is, negated.\n|\nProblem: I do not, have a good estimate of what a normal burst, or assassin champion deals early on, the early damage is a guess. A better number may be in the comments.\n\n**(Q) Bang Bang Bang** - Active: Queltra&#039;s next three Basic Attacks for 6 seconds will deal 10-35% (+ 5% per 100 AP) bonus magical damage.\n(Q) Passive: If all three Basic Attacks hits the same target, that target is stunned for 1 second.\nCost: 40-80\nCooldown: 25-10\n\n**(W) Rune Enchantment** - Actives:\nActive 1 - Aggressive: Queltra increases her AP by 12-60%, but decreases all defensive stats, and healing by 8-40%.\nActive 2 - Neutral: Queltra doesn&#039;t change her stats.\nActive 3 - Defensive: Queltra increases her defensive stats by 4-20% and increases her healing by 8-40%, but decreases her AP by 16-80%.\nCost: 0\nCooldown: 2\n\n**(E) Hunter **- Passive: If an enemy champion is below 30% health and Queltra had damage that enemy, Queltra increases her movement speed by 30-80% for 6 seconds.\nCost: 0\nCooldown: 60-30\n\n**(R) Underpower** - Active: Queltra activates Blest Runes full power, creates a no magical zone for 6 seconds. All enemy abilities and active abilities are disabled in the zone, and everyone in the territory will not regen mana. Underpower won&#039;t move with Queltra.\n|\nReason: The downside for all is the no mana regen, but the ability would be too overpowered if, that wasn&#039;t the downside.\nCost: 80\nCooldown: 90\n\nIt&#039;s so hard to create an original ranged champion, the most unique thing about her is her Ult, W, and Passive. But that&#039;s mostly it. Still, hope you guys like her.\n\nFun little sample quotes:\n\nQuote, picked:\n&quot;What a pain, let us finish this quick.
