Minions or monsters outside a radius of 3000 cannot be targeted by Valor's Preying Eye. Units marked as vulnerable empowers Quinn's abilities consuming the mark.\n>\n> (Automatic) Passive - Crossbow/Demacian Sword [Range: 525, Mana: 0, Cooldown: 0]: Quinn's basic attack has 30 loaded arrows and is automatic, and will keep firing at the select target when moving. When out of ammo, Quinn reloads her crossbow 4 seconds after not taking damage (1-second reload delay). When out ammo but in combat, Quinn switches to her melee weapon, increasing her movement speed by 2%-8% (Depending on Level), AS by 4%-14% (Depending on Level), and gains 4-30 AD (Depending on Level).\n\nNew Passive Description:\nHarrier was a good idea, but the flaw was, it was hard to balance, either broken or weak. Valor's Preying Eye is there to replicate her old Harrier mechanic, but instead of a damage boost, it empowers Quinn's abilities with their own unique effect, all involving Valor. (Most Quinn players, including me, complain how little involvement Valor actually has. This was the best way to include Valor more.) For those worried for her three-shot basic attack, it is still there, but as her new E - Rapid Fire.\nThose who have seen my Quinn rework concepts, you know, I want Quinn to have some form of melee function. I like to think that Quinn would have a combat blade for a worst-case scenario, but prefers to use her semi-automatic crossbow. It would also fit with the scout/hunter theme. I had many ideas to implement it, but this, in my opinion, is by far the best. With Quinn's crossbow needing ammo, like Graves, Aphel, and Jhin, I could implement it but as a worst-case scenario, including that its unique to Quinn.\nThis new passive tries to make Quinn a little more flashy without making her overloaded. It also attempts to handle the balancing issue Harrier had.\n\n> (Active) Q - Diving Assault [Range: 500 within 1600, Mana: 45, Cooldown: 30 (9 seconds)]: Quinn signals Valor to dive and fly 500 units down the target path. Valor stops at the first target hit, dealing 15/30/50/80/160 (+ 70/75/80/90/100% AD) physical damage, applying nearsighted for 1.5 seconds to that target. Valor can dive in any direction from any point within range, and he does not interrupt Quinn's previous orders. Quinn can catch Valor mid-flight. If grabbed, Quinn launches Valor in a straight line of 1200, stopping at the first target hit, dealing 5%-40% bonus damage, stunning the enemy for 1 second. If Valor damages a unit, Diving Assault's cooldown is reduced by 70%. \n>\n> If Diving Assault is used when Behind Enemy Lines is active, Valor drops Quinn and flies in a straight line of 1200, stopping at the first target hit, dealing 15/30/50/80/160 (+ 70/75/80/90/100% AD) physical damage, applying nearsighted for 1.5 seconds to that target.\n>\n> Non-champion targets are disarmed instead of the duration.\n>\n> Empowered Diving Assault: Diving Assault can be locked on the vulnerable unit. Valor will still stop at the first target hit.\n\nNew Q Description: \nDiving Assault is very much the same as Blinding Assault, except it works like a Victor E. The Blinding Assault mechanic is still present, yet you either have to grab Valor or have Behind Enemy Lines active. Diving Assault is punishing, with the intent to make Quinn less anti-fun. It justified with the flexibility Quinn gains.\n\n> (3 Lvl Ability) W - Heightened Senses {Active}[Range: 1000, Mana: 0, Cooldown: 50-30]\n> Lvl 1 - Active: Quinn signals Valor to reveal the target radius of 1000 within the range of 2000 for 2 seconds.\n> Second: 2000 to 2500.\n> Lvl 2 - Passive: Quinn's range of vision is increased by 250.\n> Forth: 250 to 500.\n> Lvl 3: Everything within Quinn's range of vision is revealed, unless under stealth. Valor's revealed area shows in stealth enemies.\n>\n> Using Heightened Senses will detach Quinn from Valor during Behind Enemy Lines.\n>\n> Empowered Heightened Senses: Using Heightened Senses near the Vulnerable unit makes Valor fly down near, fearing it for 1 second.\n\nNew W Description:\nSorry, but the current Heightened Senses is garbage, even with the added effects. She is a scout with a bird, wtf is the point of Quinn having a bird if she cannot signal Valor to scout a target area. To the point, Heightened Senses is now a level ability that functions like Kayle's Passive, with the exception that you choose how fast you want the W to progress. It is as such for the extreme vision power Quinn gains, by dividing the power in slow progression.\n\n> (Active) E - Rapid Fire [Range: 525, Mana: 40, Cooldown: 12-8\n> ]: Quinn channels for 0.5 seconds. For 5 seconds, Quinn slows down for 50%-0%, but auto fires 3 shots per second. If Quinn runs out of ammo, she instantly reloads (0.5-second delay).\n>\n> Rapid Fire becomes Detach when Behind Enemy Lines is active. Detach releases Quinn from Valor.\n\n> Empowered Rapid Fire: When attacking a vulnerable unit under X% health, Valor will dip down to execute. (For minions and monsters, X is 60% below max health; For champions, X is 90% below max health.)\n\nNew E Description:\nSimple, but fitting and flashy. Yes, Vault is gone from the E but is part of the Ult. I may get some fire for this, but. Vault as good of an ability it is, Vault would function better as Quinn's Second Active Ult, replacing Skystrike. Rapid Fire would keep Quinn's three semi-automatics feel her Passive would give, but better and on command.\nThe execute is because I ran out of ideas.\n\n> (First Active) R - Behind Enemy Lines [Range: 0, Mana: 100-25, Cooldown: 0]: Quinn channels for 0.5 seconds. Upon completing it successfully, and Valor picks her up, Quinn gains a burst of movement speed by 200% for 0.5 seconds, then increasing her total movement speed by 70%/130% and gaining the ability to activate Vault.\n>\n> Suffering immobilizing crowd control effects while Behind Enemy Lines is channeling cancels it. Taking damage from champions, monsters, or turrets while Behind Enemy Lines is active removes the bonus movement speed for 3 seconds.\n>\n> If you have a least one point in Behind Enemy Lines, respawning or returning to the summoning platform will spawn Valor.\n>\n> Empowered Behind Enemy Lines: If Quinn chases marked vulnerable champion, Behind Enemy Lines does not channel and is instant.\n\n> (Second Active) R - Vault [Range: 750, Mana: 0, Cooldown: 0]: Quinn dashes in the target direction, dealing 20-155((+ 20% AD) increased by 10%-20%(Max: 60%-120%) per 100 movement speed) physical damage, and slowing all enemy hit by 40% for 1.5 seconds. Quinn will not lose her bonus movement speed from Behind Enemy Lines but will exit Behind Enemy Lines, and keep the bonus movement speed for 0.5 seconds after the dash.\n\nNew R Description:\nThe ultimate is much the same, but Skystrike is replaced by Vault. Skystrike is gameplay and thematically useless, and I was unable to make any fit for it, unless if I made MF 2.0. Therefore, I removed it, with Vault taking its place. If you guys do not like it, I will go back to the drawing board.","replies":[{"poster":"FlameHalbrdOkido","date":"2019-12-18T05:43:49.751+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like this rework, its pretty gud work, we can tell ur passionate\nAs a marksman tho Quinn shouldnt have access to such a strong cc as a fear, it also doesn't really seem to fit their theme, maybe for a minion yeah, but against a champion it doesn't make as much sense, a simple slow however could work. Besides that i like how the W works thematically and how it can work with the passive it makes a lot of sense for Quinn to use Valor to scout a target area like blue ward, but if Valor see's a low health enemy then he goes in to harass them\n\nthe new E i think is also a solid ability, tho i wonder if a Nunu E styled - 3 targeted bolts in a line wouldn't have worked here too. I get that ur trying to work the old passive in, but what if the old passive were the empowered version if all three skillshot bolts hit?\n\nand i think many and even Riot will agree that E is the most likely ability to get cut in a future rework, its cool sure but its on of their biggest pain points. Bringing a squishy marksman in close b4 making them dash back just doesn't make much sense, it pretty much only works if ur ahead.\n\nin terms of the R, i'd rather have the channel duration scale dwn with ranks, it should be 2 intially bc it offers alot.\nthe empowered version is too strong, this is why the channel should start at 2, and scale down to say, 1, and with the empowered version then it can be 0.5, i don't think u want to deal with someone who can basically cast their ult 2x, bc thats just too much chasing or escape power.\n\nIn any case i think u did the right move with R and E overall.","replies":[]}]}
