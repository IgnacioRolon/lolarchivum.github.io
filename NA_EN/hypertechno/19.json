Because everyone, somehow in Riots eyes, does not want to try or try to get better. Nothing is equal Riot, there is, only balance. \n\nThis type of system works when you have a small group of people playing League of Legends, this is perfect for diamond and over because they know the game the best, but even there it fails. You have a player base of 100 million now, there won&#039;t be any 50/50 +/- 1 games. I would suggest basing teams the way Mobalytics is basing players on aggression, fighting, vision, toughness, teamplay, consistency, and versatility. Base teams on skills and what lacks, so it&#039;s balanced that way. If I lag at farming, put me against a person who knows how to farm but lags another aspect, that I&#039;m good at. This will not be everyone, but most players, when they see him or her doing better at that skill they lag, they will think &quot;I need to get better at that.&quot;\n\nI do not consider myself a pro, I can&#039;t win every game. But there will be many games, where players played really well, won&#039;t be able to carry at all. There is a large chance of us getting a team that can&#039;t communicate with us, ward, don&#039;t know follow up, or a team that just plain out fed the enemy team.\n\nSometimes we get lucky. However, I hate the fact that we can&#039;t depend on our skill, but have to depend on luck. This game is not something you can put a 50/50 system on anymore, that&#039;s not how the world works it&#039;s not a casino. Everyone is not at the same equal skill stat, they are either worse or better at one or more things to balance out.\n\nI&#039;m not a pro, many of my games were my fault. But because it doesn&#039;t matter if I&#039;m skilled, fed, place relevant wards, getting better. It won&#039;t matter because it isn't 50/50 and it&#039;s about luck. \n\nPlayers who put too much time into this game to get better, won&#039;t be rewarded for their hard work. Please, understand Riot.","replies":[{"poster":"Subdue","date":"2018-03-05T04:21:47.185+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"If the majority of your games feel \"like a casino\" it's because the system has accurately placed you and you no longer have a significant skill advantage over the people you're playing with to control the outcome of games.","replies":[{"poster":"HyperTechno","date":"2018-03-05T15:01:53.097+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Subdue,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=FyKsgptU,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-03-05T04:21:47.185+0000)\n>\n> If the majority of your games feel &quot;like a casino&quot; it&#x27;s because the system has accurately placed you and you no longer have a significant skill advantage over the people you&#x27;re playing with to control the outcome of games.\n\nI see what you are getting at, I can't really disagree with your statement because its true.

It works but is very limited. I found a player with 0% win rate. If one person can reach that number, many other players can as well. Proving that the 50/50 system is kinda unbalanced. No one should be this low on the scale.\n\nThe 50/50 system only favors one or the other side, this should not be a true statement. It should be based on peoples overall knowledge of the game, skills, communication, warding, and strategy. I do not see that happening in Leauge of Legends, it is about, what team comb is better and who just got lucky.\n\nYou can make a successful Baron b8, but it can't help a team turn things around a lot of the time. That's the problem, there is not enough in the game, that could turn it around if the enemy is ahead. If they are ahead that is it, end of the line.

The system selects 10 players of relatively similar skill, skill being measured by MMR, which is directly based on each player's /past/ ability to win relative to the player base.  This means that going into the game, both teams should have a 50/50 chance to win.  It does not mean that you have a 50/50 chance to win after you've been heavily outpicked in champ select.  It does not mean you have a 50/50 chance to win after you give up first blood in a pre-minion invade.  It does not mean you have a 50/50 chance to win after you've given up 3 towers.","replies":[{"poster":"HyperTechno","date":"2018-03-07T15:15:34.824+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Subdue,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=FyKsgptU,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2018-03-05T16:29:35.288+0000)\n>\n> This sounds like a misunderstanding of what Riot meant by 50/50.

Smurfs playing in lower elo, they just lose two or three games even though they hammered the low elo players, they stay in that elo level because they purposefully lost the game. Making the 50/50 system inaccurate and won't make any fair match ups. Team games should be measured the same way Mobalytics is basing people because if Riot does this instead of this MMR BS, the 50/50 system would be more accurate, would make the game a lot more fun, and maybe even more competitive and develop new good players.

Okay let's see:\n\n1.  Regarding Hibeki: If playing the game a long time is all the cred you need to talk about the ranked system, I've been playing Season 1, been Gold + in every Season I've played in, was Platinum last season, and am Platinum this season.  \n\n2.  Regarding the casino comment: It has been beaten to death man.  Platinum+ is full of smurfs.  That means people who are good at the game rise to the top, and they do so _quickly and consistently,_ while cutting right through Bronze, Silver, and Gold.  In fact, back when dodging champ select affected your rating, several people would document literally dodging champ select over and over again to dunk their ratings into Bronze, so they could stomp their way back up.  Hell, there are Elo Boosters _making money_ off of being able to carry accounts from Bronze to Diamond.  The only rating where people have grounds to complain about matchmaking are way up there in Diamond 1+, where there are so few people that you might end up with Challengers in a game otherwise filled with Diamonds, or people autofilled into roles that aren't their mains.  But there's no way around that short of hour+ long queue times.  That issue does not apply to Bronze.\n\n3.  Regarding 10 random players: If you take any 10 people with 100 games played in Bronze 4 and match them in various combinations over and over again,  they'll all end up close to 50%.  This is because they're all about equally skilled.  There's no one with 100 games in Bronze 4 that's 10X better better than someone else with 100 games in Bronze 4.  If he were 10X better, he wouldn't be in Bronze 4.  That's how that works.  Yes, if an unknown player is introduced to the system, it takes a few games to sort them out.  And if you're lucky/unlucky enough to be in a game with that unknown player, well they may or may not have more agency over the game than you do.  No system can accurately sort unknowns right off the bat.  Riot's matchmaker is extremely good at moving them quickly though.  When Diamond players smurf, they end up in Gold or even Platinum within 20-30 ranked games.  Again, there's no shortage of empirical evidence on this.\n\n4.  Regarding shit talking: Yes, shit talking loses games.  I never do it, and I immediately mute people who do, so they don't throw off my concentration or tilt me.  Shit talking happens all over, no matter how good or bad the players are.  But I think you think that if someone does poorly in your game, that makes them a bad player.  However, that player objective speaking is likely about as good as you are, and wins about as consistently as you do against the same players you play against.  I'll use myself as an example.  In my match history you'll find a game where I went 6-5-2 as Rammus.  In that same game, I had a Kat on my team that went 3-10-2.  But at one point in the game she was 0-8-0.  She had fed 6 kills to the enemy Fizz within 15 minutes.  Was she a bad player?  No, she was just having a bad game.  And if you check her match history, prior to that game, she had won 8 of her last 10 games as Kat, and in multiple games had double digit kills.  People like you however would look at that score in the one game she played with you and say \"Fucking matchmaker, why do you stick me with these bads.\"\n\n5.  Regarding the stuff you quoted from Zileas's post: There is no shortage of players in Bronze 4.  You aren't ending up in a scenario where games are \"Less ideal\" in Bronze 4.  That only applies at the very top of the ladder, where there are very few players.  When I say very top, I mean like Challenger level.  Challenger players get matched fairly frequently with Diamond players because there aren't always Challenger players playing, and otherwise they'd have to wait for hours in queue.  Again, this does not apply to Bronze 4 players like you.\n\n6.  Regarding your impersonation: Yes, I am right.  But no, I never claimed the system is never wrong.  In fact, I specifically provided several circumstances where the system can get things wrong - but these are circumstances where there is no system that would always get them right.  Examples of such circumstances include 1) A smurf that has played too few games to be decently matched - fewer than 30 games, 2) People intentionally losing a match, which no system can ever predict, 3) People playing on accounts they don't own.\n\n7.  Regarding your list of questions: all of those are answered in the above.  Google \"Elo Booster\" and see how many people are making money off of proving you wrong.  Look through the ladder and count all the people in Platinum and Diamond  with less than 100 games played.  Comb through your friends list and see if you can find even one person who has played more than 50 games this season and is still more than 1 tier away from their previous tier.

People who take time and dedication should be at the top while the people who don't fall. You really don't get what a rank system is.

And that means stomping your lane, getting massively fed, and then hard pressuring the map until you win.\n\nAnd another:\n\n> [{quoted}](name=ShatoSummoner,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=n3f5kn7V,comment-id=002f,timestamp=2015-11-04T14:13:47.594+0000)\n>\n> Idk. I climbed from bronze IV to silver 1 in less than 100 games. Almost gold 5 now (currently at 84 LP). Its not hard for me, and I&#x27;m actually a player using his main account. I also currently have a 65% win rate in ranked overall. Tbh, silver is pretty easy, and thats coming from someone who isn&#x27;t a smurf. I will agree that teammates can really be a dice roll on how lucky you get sometimes, but I can carry well enough regardless depending on my role (Support and jungle can be harder, but I play both regardless).\n\nAnd another:\n\n> [{quoted}](name=ChoGathsSon,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=n3f5kn7V,comment-id=003f,timestamp=2015-11-04T15:00:52.337+0000)\n>\n> Dunno, went 8-2 on placements on this account and I&#x27;m about to have it Diamond. One of my losses was because I duo&#x27;d with a friend and his internet died. The other was just one of those games I couldn&#x27;t carry because everyone fed so hard. I was placed G4 and got plat in like 2-3 days. \n> \n> I don&#x27;t find anything below plat 2 to be difficult but I&#x27;ll say I hate the current elo I&#x27;m at because of all the d5 0lp lifers and the 1,000+ games played plat grinders because you can gain elo with a 51% winrate as long as you play enough games and these players are typically the worse.\n\nAnd another:\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Sozan5,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=n3f5kn7V,comment-id=003a,timestamp=2015-11-04T14:50:55.609+0000)\n>\n> This is only partially true though.\n> \n> Silver elo is difficult if you try playing it as you do on much higher ranks, simply because your teammates play completely different. That said however, it gets much easier once you use other strategies, like the simple ones that are way less effective on higher elos.\n\nI could keep going but I hope you get the point.  Just like the Hibeki thread, this is just one high elo player whining that it took him a bit longer than he expected to climb back out of silver on a smurf, and a whole bunch of silver players jumping on the band wagon to call Elo hell.\n\nAs for lying about when I started, I did no such thing lol.  Please see the screenshot of my account icons, Gold in Season 1 and Season 2: \n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/sUdeTrM.jpg\n\nBut actually, I told you where you could find the proof.  You conveniently ignored it.  Explain this to me: If, as you say, Silver is super difficult to get through because of xyz excuse, how is it that players can run a business off of taking a low elo account and rapidly winning games to raise that account's rank?\n\nhttp://lmgtfy.com/?q=League+of+Legends+Elo+Boost\n\nSome of their businesses are so successful they can afford to buy adspace on Google!","replies":[{"poster":"HyperTechno","date":"2018-03-11T00:11:33.162+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"-_- I got the point without the extra quotes.\n\nWell, the picture tells us everything, so I can't really counter that.

True for the reason that it's quite hard to match people up fair and square when 100 million people are playing the game. Since most of those millions are at the bottom. It's even harder to separate pros or just good players from lower elo games. That's why we see so many bronze or silver players and so few challenges. Most of the good people didn't get the chance to start in the early seasons when there where only a few people. I would probably be some around Gold or your level if I started in season 3. Right now many people do not get the chance to climb high, I could almost get out of Bronze in season 7 but failed to do so because I was hit by a massive losing streak or I could not get my promos finished.\n\nIt's easier said than done. You can give all bronze players the tools, tips, and tricks. 95% of those people won't make it anywhere, and 4% will just be stuck in another elo.

Sorry.\n\nRegarding Promos: Honestly, I don't really care one way or the other.  In a macro sense, they don't really matter.  MMR is what matters.  If your MMR keeps rising, eventually you're forced into promo after promo until you symbolicly win one.  So there's no point sweating about it.  However, promos were added so that forgiveness could also be added.  Right now, let's say that you just barely claw your way from Silver to Gold.  Right now, you have to win a series, but after you do, your MMR can fall all the way down to Silver 4 before you are in risk of dropping back into silver.  In Season 1, there weren't any promos.  If you won a game at 1490 MMR, you'd cross 1500 and you'd be Gold.  Lose the next game and poof, you're back in Silver.  This caused people to get to a target tier and then just stop, for fear of losing it.\n\nRegarding Boosting: I don't agree with boosting in the slightest, nor was I suggesting that you go get yourself boosted.  My point was merely that the existence of boosters is clear evidence that good players can climb out of low Elo.\n\nRegarding tying LP or MMR to anything other than killing the Nexus: There is only one decision you can make in LoL which is absolutely correct 100% of the time.  Everything else, there is some degree of ambiguity.  For example, taking Cloud Drake.  In general, it's a good a idea.  Is it a good idea to be at Cloud Drake when the enemy is at Baron?  Probably not.  Dying, usually a bad idea right?  Well what if you're the 0/5/15 Alistar at 1/4 HP and you're diving into 3 enemies to Headbutt/Pulverize them so that your 8/0/12 Vayne can get away?  When you start tying LP or MMR to things which aren't always conducive to winning, you start creating incentive for less than optimal play.\n\nRegarding Honors:  Honor was introduced to reward good behavior, not skilled play.  Skilled play is rewarded by progression.  I think it's important to keep the two separated.  Also, in general I think the IFS is more forgiving than I'd like.\n\nRegard Platinum and how many players are in there: I think we should add a Wood Tier underneath Bronze, and a Styrofoam Tier under that, just to give visibility.  Players enter at Silver, which is why that's basically the middle of the rankings, as most people are average and rarely stray far from the center.  If we added additional Tiers below Bronze, you'd be able to see the full spread, and it would look like a bell curve.\n\nLastly, I just want to add I don't consider myself mechanically skilled.  I like to play simple champions, and I like to have as few skillshots as possible, because I'm bad at them.  God awful.  Last hitting, not great at that either.  My primary role is jungler, and I've played probably 95% of all my ranked games from the last two seasons as a jungler.  My advice to you, from someone who's mechanically terrible at this game, is that you can get to Platinum while being mechanically terrible.  What you need is game knowledge.  What I mean by that is that you can win in Bronze, in Silver, and even in Gold by simple being at the right place at the right time, and getting your team there too.  There are free kills, free towers, free Dragons, and free Barons all strewn over the lower elos, waiting to be picked.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Subdue","date":"2018-03-10T04:36:38.373+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=HyperTechno,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=FyKsgptU,comment-id=0000000000000000000000000000000100000000,timestamp=2018-03-09T22:55:43.222+0000)\n>\n> I have been able to beat Diamond players before, so stop using that pathetic meme.

If Riot actually took the time to make the game fair for everyone, you would see a dramatic change in ranking. You will see many more challenges and a few bronze players. Gold should be the rank where most players should be because then there is space for the worst of the worst, who are at the bottom. Giving others the chance to be the best of the best up on the top. People who take time and dedication should be at the top while the people who don&#x27;t fall. You really don&#x27;t get what a rank system is. It&#x27;s kinda like a civilization, we have the people who won&#x27;t try what-so-ever even if you give them the chance, they are at the bottom for a reason. While people who just want to live comfortably live in a comfortable lifestyle with a comfortable job. Then there are the people who take a lot of time and dedication and rise to the top because they want to be the best. They never come late, they always work, they never take a break, and they want the best of the best. It should be easy to climb out of Bronze, but hard to get out of Gold because you need to be willing to put the time and effort into the game. With the system Riot has right now, it&#x27;s easier the higher you climb. Even if your good and have taken time and dedication and you are low elo, you are not rewarded at all. Plain and simple, the old system is garbage and need change.\n> \n> Here, this guy explains exactly what I&#x27;m going through.\n> https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/n3f5kn7V-as-a-diamond-silver-elo-is-surprisingly-hard\n> \n> It really just seems to me you don&#x27;t get it.

You even had the audacity to lie to someone who checks his shit and reads before he talks.

You do even give me any sources for anything you wrote. Same goes for Magewick, full of shit and no evidence.\n\nOkay, I'll bite.  Quotes from the very thread that you referenced.

You definitely have to play differently and get fed as hell and get the objectives early. I main jungle so I have to kill the turrets whenever I get a kill or the games will stall out too long. Most games on my smurf I have at least 20 kills and have to have a full build by 30 mins.

I was kept in silver 1 because I was perma stuck at 0 LP. Some people blame afk&#x27;s for their losses, but I managed to go 11 games in a row with an afk, only managing to win 2 of those games. player skill was incredibly inconsistent as you said already. The second I got out of silver, I shot up to plat in about 2 weeks. the play style changed so much in plat that i had no idea what to do for the first few weeks other than play my mains and hope for the best. It seems in plat games are decided in the first 10 minutes, and every lane has an early game champion. I see the same pool of about 25 champions every single game.

Instead, stroke the hell out of their ego. \"Damn I saw that so lucky\" or \"You're fine she just got a lucky play\". U blame things on things other than that player and just watch the magic. That ally is instantly healed. Boom.\n\n> Know why positive players win more games? Cuz we all circle jerk each other so much we just win through a lack of negativity. But it's not because we're positive--it's because the enemy is negative! 9 times out of 10 the enemy team has some kind of internal conflict going on. The best ones are when they /all chat it. That's basically instant victory. Read the situation and chime in with some juicy provocation. Enemy: \"GG my jungler never ganks\" -> You: \"Lmao right\" OR \"Try warding? Stop blaming your jungler\". The butthurt you have instilled into the target player will cause a rectal implosion so devastating it can crash their connection. Always aim for the most vulnerable link. Is it verbal abuse? Idk, is \"Lmao right?\" or \"Stop blaming your teammates\" verbally abusive? I wouldn't think so ;) Also people like to work with friends. When the team is positive, you become their temporary (or permanent) friend and they will more than likely listen to calls.\n\nHe actually described me in season 6, oh I was such a stupid player. It wasn't until I had played a quarter of season 7. I changed from a flaming idiot to an actually more calm person, this doesn't mean I don't get tilted, but I have gotten better at keeping it to myself and calming down and admit to my mistakes.\n\nHe basically summons up my ranked games, except I'm a mid lane main and I never really got anywhere. So, unfortunately, I have given up on trying to climb. \n\n> Yeah, I've gotten my smurf to high plat and it took about 70 games with like 50 games won. You definitely have to play differently and get fed as hell and get the objectives early. I main jungle so I have to kill the turrets whenever I get a kill or the games will stall out too long. Most games on my smurf I have at least 20 kills and have to have a full build in 30 mins. If I don't, the chances of victory basically boil down to who gets caught 40 mins in the game.\n\nYou are completely right:\n\n> The OP there says he had a hard time, but he doesn't say he couldn't do it.\n\nBut no seriously if you do want to just fuck around and play some champs in a 1v1 I'm down for it. Because make an enemy a friend.\n\nI think we have both hated each other a little too much, so what you say. Let's us put our differences aside and agree that we are both idiots. Your right in certain areas and I'm right in others.\n\n{{sticker:vlad-salute}} \nFuck I hate Vlad, such cancer. But its a smile and he looks friendly.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Lord of Math","date":"2018-03-08T04:35:56.389+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Chances are that you are better than your teammates at certain aspects of the game, but they are probably better than you at other things.
