I hate Garens Silence, I hate the Teemo Q, and so on. \r\nBut I do not hate Wukongs W, I think its a great skill that can give some great ways to get away. But a question has always struck me, why can Wukong activate this ability in combat or why does he not take any small amout of damage when the decoy is hit or deploide. Kida like Vlad&#039;s W, where he becomes untargetable, but with a price of his health. \r\n\r\nI also looked at his mana cost on his W ability, 50 to 70 mana and his cooldown form 18 to 10 seconds. This ability is too spamable for such a strong ability. I do not feel like he is punished enough for spaming this ability. \r\n\r\nI know you Wukong mains out there would say, but you have to play him a ceartain way. Sure, I will try him. He looks however quit easy to play, he reminds me kinda like Quinn and Fiora. But easier and safer.\r\n\r\n But to be all out honest, I think his W is still quit broken and to spamable, with little to no punishment. \r\n\r\nBut you guys may differ, plz, do share.","replies":[]}
