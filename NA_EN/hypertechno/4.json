Now, during his last breath, regret and shame filled his head, as he slowly scanned his body that was, filled with arrows. With the knowledge of who his killer was, his fear of death was made clear.\r\n&quot;H-ha ha, what a shame, never knew my own child. (Cough!) Would be the one assassinating me.&quot;\r\n&quot;It was only destiny when you spared my mother, your death was inevitable.&quot;\r\n&quot;Yes, but how can you kill a person you hold dear when you know they did nothing wrong. I wanted to protect you and my wife.&quot;\r\n&quot;Lier, you don&#039;t care who you kill, your legacy shows it.&quot;\r\n&quot;Yes, I have killed but isn&#039;t it enough for Noxus to stay strong? One nation, united and free. No rules, and no war. Isn&#039;t it what you Demacians seek?&quot;\r\n&quot;Yes, but why concern yourself with others differences? We can live together differently, without forcing a unity. Let them be, who they want to be, Noxian, Demacian, or anything weird.&quot;\r\n&quot;H-ha, you are a clever girl, you earned you old mans brain. Maybe even better.&quot;\r\n&quot;Do not worry, I will fix, what you created. You still have my respect, mom never forgot you, she always told me stories of what a kind-hearted man you were, even though your vision for the future was blackened. She always told me that you never liked to kill. It must have pained you.&quot;\r\n&quot;I&#039;m no good man, I have killed too many. My last wish is for you to end this, and to give you this. It may not replace your friend, but it will help you and give you an image of who I once was. (Cough!) Take it and pull.&quot;\r\nSwain reached out with his left hand and the mysterious girl, with no hesitation, reached out and pulled. She pulls off his demon hand, and it began to glow.\r\n&quot;What the hell!&quot;\r\n&quot;Don&#039;t be afraid, its power will grant you the ability to end this war,  and hopefully, it will change your people&#039;s useless fear.&quot;\r\n&quot;I don&#039;t want magic, I have no, need for it! Tell it to stop!&quot;\r\n&quot;Sorry dear, I can&#039;t, the deal has been sealed. But, I have trained it to be obedient, it will follow your every command.&quot;\r\n&quot;You... AHHHHHH&quot;\r\nShe fell to the floor.\r\n&quot;Sleep well, this is my farewell. Wake up stronger, and a better view of who I was, and free this world. (Cough)&quot;\r\nSwain then fell to the floor and then began his endless sleep.","replies":[{"poster":"Shmeeve","date":"2018-08-28T02:50:23.301+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why did you make this skin look like me but with brown hair?\n\nam I swain?","replies":[{"poster":"AbiwonKenabi","date":"2018-08-28T02:55:51.492+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Mom...how do I say this...I'm Swain.\"\n\n\"Have you tried...NOT being Swain?\"\n\n\"It's not a lifestyle choice Mom!\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fullmetallic","date":"2018-08-28T13:09:44.202+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> am I swain?\n\nOn this blessed day, we are ALL swain.","replies":[{"poster":"nyakasgoods","date":"2018-08-29T02:54:32.291+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=CÃ ptain Bone,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=nAF6HFxm,comment-id=00000001,timestamp=2018-08-28T13:09:44.202+0000)\n>\n> On this blessed day, we are ALL swain.\n\nSpeak for yourself","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Arcade Lulu","date":"2018-08-28T14:30:10.018+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That picture looks so pretty :o","replies":[]}]}
