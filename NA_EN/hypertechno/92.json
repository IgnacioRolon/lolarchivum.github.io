(From a Zoe one trick main.)","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"(The beginning is a little troll towards haters, but still, have information that can make you better against her. I will also explain why pulling the, &quot;She is like Azir and Ryze&quot; card is irrelevant. So read everything, if you have any questions, I will answer as nicely as I can. If I also confused you about anything, plz let me know.)\n\nOk, now this is going to be fun. Haters are going to say I will go to easy on her. No fucking way I will. I want to play her, and I want Riot to stop nerfing her shit all the GOD DAMN TIME. \n\nHere is whatcha, gonna to do. First, change Galios W, so if it&#039;s a burst ability he will take much less damage from it, suppose to constant damage. Now we got another counter pick champion against her. Hurray. \n\nLet me also give you, a champion pool that ALREADY counters her. Just, so you children can finally STFU about the no counter pick BS.\nZed, Quinn, Zilian, Katarina, or basically, any mobility, burst, or long-range champion will do, to simplify things for you.\n\nTime for the hard part, hope you guys can handle it. It&#039;s DODGING SKILLS SHOTS, it&#039;s hard, as hell. I know it&#039;s scary to think, but you must learn this secret technique to beat Zoe. I mean, some Bronze players can do it. But I believe in you.\n\nIt&#039;s also not as if Yasuo and Zed were treated the same way, without nerfing them all the damn time, now look at them, most people now give ZERO shit. How the fuck is Zoe any fucking different. Zed is as strong as he always was, same with Yasuo. Zoe is, like Azir and Ryse, except. Zoe can&#039;t build a tower, doesn&#039;t have a dash, doesn&#039;t have a point and click stun, can&#039;t summon soldiers, doesn&#039;t have an escape, doesn&#039;t have an ult that can save her ass, every skill-shot can be blocked by creeps or by standing far away or on the upside side of Zoe. Ryse is all point and clicks, except the Q that can do loads of damage and he can clear a wave like it was nothing, hence, the reason why he is broken if buffed. Azir can do almost everything if it a good one, the reason why he is unhealthy.\n\nTo define an unhealthy champion is to see the number of mistakes that can be made or counters it has. \n\nCountering can also mean, utilize her weaknesses against her. Sadly most players out of Challenger or LCS don&#039;t know or don&#039;t do this. Even some Challengers and LCS players don&#039;t do this. It&#039;s so simple, and effective, but never utilized, no wonder Zoe is strong.\n\nWith Zoe, you have plenty of counters, however, if a good Zoe player you can&#039;t make as many, mistakes. So instead of babbling about Zoe being strong, learn her, counters. Zed and Yasuo fit in the same category, many counters, but good players, make virtually no mistakes. \n\nAzir, Ryze, Yi, Trynd, and Malzahar have almost no counters, which is fine, but a good player will again, almost never make a mistake. That&#039;s how they are, unhealthy broken, if too, strong. They are nerfed so far down, where if you make a mistake you can&#039;t play them. Period. But can&#039;t buff them, because it will make them OP.\n\nEven so, you can still make many mistakes with Zoe, even as a good player. So she is even harder than Zed and Yasuo. What Riot is doing is nerfing her like Ryze and Azir, except it&#039;s not healthy for her, because that&#039;s not her fault. Her fault is, not being countered enough. Riot needs to make it so, that the champions that can counter her are strong enough to counter her, and be viable in-game, without risking there team comp. Right now they are just pulling the Azir/Ryze Bs, stop it. She is nothing like Ryze or Azir.","replies":[{"poster":"Khristophoros","date":"2018-08-17T02:47:43.812+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">Zed and Yasuo\n\nso you're saying if you can't beat the cancer, join it?","replies":[{"poster":"HyperTechno","date":"2018-08-17T03:44:48.908+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Khristophoros,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=A1c0nP8H,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2018-08-17T02:47:43.812+0000)\n>\n> so you&#x27;re saying if you can&#x27;t beat the cancer, join it?\n\nWell, you can if you like, but I have no answer to it. My opinion on cancer champions is different, while yours is as well. Anything I say would be wrong or excluding others opinion.\n\nThe post is only here to inform, and I merely stated that. If comparing the best to Zoe, it would be Yasuo and Zed. Because they are all tree insanely strong when mastered, but you can still beat them if you learn how to counteract their abilities or counter pick against them.\n\nWhile Azir and Ryze, can't really be counter picked against, if strong. If they are mastered, no matter what you pick or play, they can beat you one way or another. Unlike, Zoe, Zed, and Yasuo.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ahpe","date":"2018-08-17T02:42:51.968+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"TL;DR Please","replies":[{"poster":"HyperTechno","date":"2018-08-17T03:27:02.388+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's a little hard to make a good explanation on a small informal note.
