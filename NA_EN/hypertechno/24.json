Expecaly in Bronze.","subforum":"General Discussion","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Riot, I am not going to put up with this. Certain games are meant to be dodged, especially if you are in bronze. The team comps in bronze have let many lost games form me. I do not want my LP to suffer because I get team members who cannot decide to play the role or just pick a champion while blindfolded. \r\n\r\nRiot cut me some slack, I am in bronze and I will get team comps that are out of this world. I can understand if it is Gold and up because they should have a good idea of what they are doing. But, punishing me for dodging a game that is simply unwinnable because of the team comp irritates me, because now I lost points for a game I know I would not win and I dodge to keep my LP safe, but no. Thank you, Riot.","replies":[]}
