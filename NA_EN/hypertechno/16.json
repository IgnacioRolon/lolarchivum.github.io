In the invasion of his home by the Void, Uukahaa was forced to find a new home for him and his people. Runetera, a world filled with magic, magic stronger than their own. This magic introduced unknown powers within him and his people. Power so strong it could be felt miles away. However, this power let to the Darkin War. Uukahaa stood almost victor until they found a way to turn the tables, they sealed his four best soldiers and used them against him. The Darkins where almost wiped out. Even with Uukahaa&rsquo;s power to decimate an army with ease, his last men fell, the Darkins were no more. Unable to kill Uukahaa they took the option to seal him, sealing him into his crown.\n\tUukahaa&rsquo;s abnormal magical power gives him the ability to manipulate his own blood magic to its fullest potential and beyond. Blood Burst and Shadownova are abilities fused with blood magic and the drained magical powers of The Shadow Isles. \nShadownova was also the ability that turned the Isles into the Shadow Isles. However, it is not the full reason why the Isles turned into the Shadow Isles. It was the unstable power of his blood magic when he was released that created the mist that turns living beings into walking shadowy figures filled with hate.\n\nTHEME\nHow I want it to sound like.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBjHPqMz0q0\n\nLORE\nComing Soon\n\nABILITIES\nMana: 70 to 20\tCooldown: 2 seconds, to 0 seconds at max\t\t\t\t\t\n\nRange: 300  Splash Range: 200\nQ - Blood Burst (Skill Shot): \nCan channel for 8 seconds. Doing the channel, Uukahaa creates a blood magic sphere. Upon release Uukahaa throws the sphere, exploding in a cone at the nears enemy or wall.\n\nDealing 20 - 50 (+ 15% AP), to 40 - 100 (+ 30% AP) at max charge.\n\nDeals 25% less damage to all enemies hit by the splash damage.\n\nThis Ability goes on cooldown when the Sphere has been thrown.\n\nFull charge is every 5 seconds.\n\nUukahaa can still move under the channel.\n\nW - Deny:\nAll Cc is negated, then a blood magic curse is thrown at the caster with the same effect as the Cc negated. If the caster dealt damage to Uukahaa while under the Cc, the caster takes 20% of that damage, and a 30% of Uukahaa&rsquo;s AD.\n\n(It can stop all Cc and can be activated even if silenced.)\n\nMana: 30\tCooldown: 20 seconds\tRange: 500\nE - Leap:\nLeaps to nearby enemy or ally. He is still targetable. \nIf leaping to an enemy, leap will deal 20-40 (+ 60% AD) damage.\n\nIf Shadownova is active:\nLeaps to target champion with Shadownova hitting the champion directly. Dealing an extra 10-50% AP damage to that champion, plus the leap damage.\n\nThe Shadownova effect is not changed and will still send the burst of flames around.\n\nIf that champion is lower than 40% of there max health when hit, the champion is executed.\n\nIf E was used on a target champion, the damage cannot be negated no matter what.\n\nMana: 100\tCooldown: 1 min to 45 seconds\tRange: 1000-1500 \nR - Shadownova:\nCan channel for 8 seconds. Doing the channel, Uukahaa creates a ball of unstable blood magic. Upon release, Uukahaa smashes the ball onto the ground sending a burst of flames around him for 500 units to 1500 units depending on how long he channeled. \n\nDealing 200 - 300 (+ 50% AP), to 300 - 400 (+ 100% AP) at full charge.\n\nFull charge is every 5 seconds.\n\nAt full charge, Uukahaa can execute champions 250 units away who are lower than 40% of there max health.","replies":[{"poster":"JarodDempsey","date":"2018-01-04T23:17:29.445+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"P: the passive is questionable at best. a much cooler one might be that uukahaa's abilities fill his targets with darkness (fill their hp bars in reverse with black) effectively lowering their max hp by a percent of the damage dealt to them by his abilities.

In addition to all of that it could cause them to progressively lose vision that starts when their health reaches 50% darkness and reach 100% vision loss at 100% darkness, they would literally be consumed by shadows.\n\noverall: the main problem with this is the inclusion of blood magic it really makes q and r repetitive and too similar to vlad, instead just go pure shadow magic in which case it would make his kit fit much better thematically and change q name to shadow burst. Also, get rid of any of those ad damages, the only one that is arguable ad is leap but if you change its name to fit better with shadow magic then it can do magic damage scaling off of your ap which would be better for his kit anyways.","replies":[{"poster":"HyperTechno","date":"2018-01-05T04:06:23.300+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JarodDempsey,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=gqrZiH3G,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-01-04T23:17:29.445+0000)\n>\n> P: the passive is questionable at best. a much cooler one might be that uukahaa&#x27;s abilities fill his targets with darkness (fill their hp bars in reverse with black) effectively lowering their max hp by a percent of the damage dealt to them by his abilities.

You will see the changes when I reupload Uukahaa.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"WolframWolf","date":"2018-01-05T23:19:51.540+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cool idea but the ultimate is a little too OP.
