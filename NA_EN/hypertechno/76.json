Please, if someone does state their political opinion, please do not ridicule or shame anyone. People are different with different views of the world. But, you have the right to explain why they are wrong, however, if they will not agree, agree to disagree.\r\n\r\nA lot of the time, especially now, I see lots of this with things, should be called this or that. Else I hear, it should be censored, because of this or that.\r\n\r\nOpinion:\r\nIn all honesty, I do not mind what a game call its products. Games are mostly fiction, and unreal. So as League of Legends. Where I flip, is when it is historically based or closely related with historical facts added with fiction. Such as; Assassin Creed, some Call of Duty and Battlefield games, The Sims, or games close related, with history or reality. I get nit-picky.\r\nBut when it comes to Games, like League, it should not matter. Content should not be based on what is happening in the world, but in the natural fantasy of the designer. If that is a perverted fantasy, I will find it weird, but I will not care. Video Games, like League, should not be held accountable for their content, but their actions on the subject outside of the game.\r\n\r\nI know this is a very edged post, and I will get views from both sides. I will not call any moderator an idiot for closing this post, or delete it. I will respect the choice.\r\n\r\nAgain, please be nice to each other.","replies":[]}
