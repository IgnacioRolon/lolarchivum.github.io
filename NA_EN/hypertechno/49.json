As someone who is trying their hardest to get better at the game, the two champions just really makes it hard to do anything. I can farm, pressure, roam, and the rarest of them all ward in bronze. That is the reasons I am almost out of Bronze. But seemingly I have seen many Veigar players and Nasus players in my games and because I am still in bronze, I have a good chance of getting someone on my team that will feed them if I am not against them. However, I do get good teammates at times when facing a Nasus or Veigar. \r\n\r\nAlso, Skooch kinda sums it up.\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ko6_F8FuPRM","replies":[{"poster":"FOR JUSTICE","date":"2018-01-21T05:14:11.269+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ayyy mah boi skooch.\n\n\nbut people who stack like {{champion:45}} {{champion:31}} {{champion:14}} {{champion:75}} are just kind of supposed to do this by design. if you can manage to get them to late game, they are great at exploding 3/5 members of a team. so even if you nerf them, all it does is delay the inevitable tbh, because they just... stack.\n\njust hardcore pew-pew farm until 20 minuets","replies":[{"poster":"HyperTechno","date":"2018-01-21T05:29:27.337+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Snapp2Kill,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=eINp5Zus,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-01-21T05:14:11.269+0000)\n>\n> ayyy mah boi skooch.\n> \n> \n> but people who stack like {{champion:45}} {{champion:31}} {{champion:14}} {{champion:75}} are just kind of supposed to do this by design. if you can manage to get them to late game, they are great at exploding 3/5 members of a team. so even if you nerf them, all it does is delay the inevitable tbh, because they just... stack.\n\nI would love to see them get the delay then, right now, in this meta, with no extra armor, mp, mr, or lethality. They are two monsters that need to be set on a holt. In 2017 with the old rune system, they had to make it to the late. Now it is getting through early and dominate mid game.\n\nVeigar is by far the strongest out of the two, at least Nasus... Nop. They are both painfully stupid right now.\n\nThe biggest hope I have right now is that Riot won't come out with anymore stacking champions like Veigar and Nausus. Because if that happens I am just out of the game, I do not want to deal with a champion that can be uncountable in the fucking mid-early and beyond if the player isn't an idiot.","replies":[{"poster":"KVbqbFsC8e","date":"2018-01-21T07:26:16.216+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nasus has always been more powerful in the midgame compared to late.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ScaryWaffleMan","date":"2018-01-21T05:27:18.690+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"they should do like they do with thresh\nafter like 100 stacks on nasus the stakcs should be worth less like .45 or .5 then less an less","replies":[{"poster":"ZephyrDrake","date":"2018-01-21T09:29:22.736+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ScaryWaffleMan,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=eINp5Zus,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2018-01-21T05:27:18.690+0000)\n>\n> they should do like they do with thresh\n> after like 100 stacks on nasus the stakcs should be worth less like .45 or .5 then less an less\n\nexcept that they removed that a long time ago and now he always gets the same amount of AP and bonus armor no matter how many stacks he gets","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hydra Headhunter","date":"2018-01-21T09:26:59.526+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"If the problem existed (and I'm not saying it does), this method would be a little too harsh. It would be better to decrease the number of stacks nasus gets per Q-kill, to 2/4 around 20 stacks/min and 1/2 around 25 s/min (and maybe, adding a after ten minutes, if below 10 stacks/min the stacks per Q-kills goes up to 4/8)\n\nThis way, it becomes harder to stack him when he's stacked high relative to the game state and if he falls behind it becomes easier for him to catch up. I suggest this because an underfed Nasus is useless so flat nerfs to his ability to stack Q  (or the worth of stacks as you suggest) would make laning against any bully impossible rather than hard.\n\nAlso, who want's to do the math to figure out if how much damage 375 stacks is worth if 175 stacks are above the 100 limit, when it would be better to just make it 292.5 stacks do 293 damage: simple.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Yes Daddy PIease","date":"2018-01-21T07:24:48.468+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yess. you sum up the totality of the bronze and silver players (me) feelings very well skooch","replies":[]}]}
