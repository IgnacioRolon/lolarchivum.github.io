The king rose, then the silence was broken with one beautiful voice starting to sing. A coffin of beauty was board into the room. The king then moved with small slow steps toward it, no tears fell, only a sad smile. He then sat a crown on the coffin. Then the crowd bowed with the king, except for the orchestra. \nAs they all rose, the son of the king put his hand on his father&#039;s shoulder and said.\n&quot;Dad, mom died, protecting Demacia, she will be remembered for generations. You chose a brave woman.&quot;\nThen the tears fell, still smiling.\n&quot;Yes, I did. Goodbye, my Queen.&quot;\nThen the screams of eagles could be heard. Up high 550 azurite eagles flew, landing near the coffin bowing in honor.\n\n\n\n25 years have passed since the Demacian and Noxian War ended with peace following between nation, but that was all in the Noxian plan. Noxus, now ready to fight again, but with a secret and forbidden weapon. A weapon used by the Darkins, known from the Darkin War, but was said to be a myth. A mythical longbow (Not Varus) said, to be able to pieces through the toughest of armors. 25 years after their loss against Demacia, the Noxian&#039;s have finally found a way to recreate a myth to reality, with the result they wanted. It could peace through the power of petricite. Now the time has come, for the second Demacian and Noxian War.\nHowever, Demacia knows, and are waiting. But, as the old generation dies the new take their place, despite the chance, the new generation is naive and believes there will be peace for eternity between the nations. Lowering their military power, though Jarvan IV and Garen still encourage the people to join the military and stand ready for anything. Though Jarvan tries to keep the military up, he has his family to worry about as well.\nWhen the war between Demacia and Noxus ended, Jarvan finally made up his mind and tried to marry Shyvanna the Half-Dragon. However, she refused. Though she did love him, as a father, not her partner. She knew well, that if she married Jarvan and got a child, she had to eat him to feed the child that will be born. However, one human isn&#039;t enough to sustain a dragon child, and she was never really interested in marrying a human. With a broken heart, Jarvan took to the forest. To the spot where his mom regularly took him as a child, the Diamond Waterfall. It was named after his mother, Sierra Sofia Diamond after she died, of an unknown origin when Jarvan IV returned from the Noxian attack on the Demacian farmland. In grief, Jarvan III ordered his men to bury her at the place she loved the most, the Diamond Waterfall. As a gift of respect, Jarvan bought a bouquet of flowers in remembrance of his mother. When he reached the Waterfall, a woman was standing by his mothers grave pay her respect. She then quickly ran off, out of curiosity he followed the woman up through the mountains. They reached a cliffside, trying not to be spotted, he hid behind a tree nearby her. She then sat down next to a dagger, taking her hoodie and helmet off revealing her beautiful purple hair. A large blue bird then dove from the sky, landing on her shoulder petting it and she began to talk. \nhttps://pre00.deviantart.net/f7f4/th/pre/i/2014/170/4/f/quinn_and_valor___reminiscence_by_ptcrow-d7n23sv.jpg\nHe then quickly realized who she was. Quinn, the first woman to ever reach General of the Intel Operative Team, the most secretive and dangerous behind enemy lines team. Only 0 or 1 of 1000 well train soldiers, never picked again, are hired by that team. Though Quinn was a woman, she fought hard in the Demacian and Noxian War. It has been said she assassinated five very important Noxian generals and fought five hundred men alone, however, she was never alone. \nWith slow steps Jarvan reveals himself moving slowly towards her, with no hesitation Quinn turn around with her crossbow aimed right at his head. Then lowered her aim and began to laugh at Jarvan.\n&quot;You should have seen your face.&quot;\nWith a serious face, trying not to laugh, he said.\n&quot;You scared the living Demacia, out of me. You know who I am?&quot;\n&quot;Of course I do, you&#039;re Jarvan IV. You followed me from your mom&#039;s grave through the forest, to here.&quot;\n&quot;What were you doing at my mom&#039;s grave?&quot;\n&quot;Today is my brothers birthday. Normally, I pass by the Waterfall to get here. So today I just thought that I should pay my respect.&quot;\n&quot;So where is your brother, are you suppose to meet here?&quot;\n&quot;Oh, you don&#039;t know either. Huh, guess no one didn&#039;t care, except the nobles. Typical.&quot;\n&quot;What happened to your brother?&quot;\n&quot;He died, as we were saving the nobles from a Tuskvore. It was a pretty sight.&quot;\nThe brightness of her expression two seconds ago quickly turned into a face of affliction and regret. Reminding Jarvan of him when he lost his mother. He then reached out for Quinn, pulling her towards his chest.\n&quot;I&#039;m sorry, I asked too many questions. I know the pain of losing someone you hold dear.&quot;\nThough Quinn didn&#039;t shet a tear and the armor was cold, she knew he wasn&#039;t joking, and a smile formed. Knowing, that one person cared. Valor confused in the air joined.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W8X5ibxYWk","replies":[]}
