Fuck off. It&#039;s also, almost, the same combo, Q-E-R Lux one shot combo. Zoe: E-Q-Q-R-W one shot combo.

I know she can, I won't deny that. But, I'm also making the point that Lux can and many others can.\n\nLux can, one shot earlier, and easier than Zoe. I know that as well cause I play both.","replies":[]}]}]}
