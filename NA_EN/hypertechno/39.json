Shen&#039;s Q didn&#039;t need a nerf. &quot;He is strong in pro play.&quot; Every video I have watched, Shen in pro play have never relied that much on their 30% slow, but there taunt. If Shen&#039;s Q was this big of a problem, I would have reduced his damage, but even that is stupid. Since he is all the way down at a, 48% win rate. I wouldn&#039;t even touch him. A small buff may actually, serve both interests. It&#039;s like Riot is doing a brinkmanship but, as a company. At some point, Riot will piss everyone off, and no one will care if Riot dies. Riot you got to get a systematic grip on your changes and stop doing all these questions and dangerous, changes. Right now, they are all random.\r\n\r\nPro&#039;s can&#039;t adapt, nor can I. You&#039;re changing everything, way too much with unrealistic speed and without a second thought. Some of the changes, I see no point in doing so, because what will it change in the future? When it comes to balancing a constant changing game, the hardest part is to look out for the future, but also to keep it in the now. You too focused on the now, that the future, sometimes. Thankfully, you still have the vision to look forward. The new Season 9 rank update, a nice touch-up. It&#039;s wanted, and you&#039;re taking your time so it will satisfy everyone.\r\n\r\nThe most frustrating changes for me personally, are all the Zoe nerfs. Why? Take a look at mages, where the fuck is all the mages? Zoe is the only God Damn mage that&#039;s in the top ten, unless if we count TF, Orianna, and Mal. Six of the top ten are Assassin. Talon, Ahri, Fizz, Zed, Ekko, and LeBlanc. But in all honesty, Zoe and TF are probably the last two good mages in this fucking game. Just you wait, they will nerf TF at one point and still sniff the assassin main&#039;s ass to satisfaction. It&#039;s fucking embracing.\r\n\r\nHonestly, if your idea is to become Fortnite, then I&#039;m out. For reals. I&#039;m ok, with the new game mode that&#039;s in testing. Because it&#039;s separate from what Summoners Rift is, a strategic, slow pace, game. You got to slow Summoners Rift down, or all you old players will leave. This fast pace bullshit is repetitive, anti-fun, and anti-strategic. I didn&#039;t play LoL, because it was fast, I played because it was strategic and fun. A modern version of chess, playing as a five-man team.\r\n\r\nI know, I sound like a know it all. But for fuck sack, that love for the game I ones had, is gone. I only play because I can still get some fun moments. But Riot changes too often, with little to almost no concern for what will happen in the future. Gosh, Darn it Riot.\r\n\r\nEver since you let that trash talker, anti-team, rage quitting baby YouTuber into you balancing team it has gone downhill. Seriously Riot, if you where are a real-life person, not a company, then look yourself in the mirror and ask yourself, who the hell are you? You make all the mistakes Fortnite is making, I wash my hands, and I&#039;m leaving it be. This will be the last complaint, hope it can at least have some agrees.\r\n\r\nI will just, stick to my storytelling, and champion concepts. If I was right, don&#039;t come crying to me Riot, I really don&#039;t care or have the energy to give a shit. You put it on yourself, and I won&#039;t clean it up for you. Idiots have to learn the hard way.","replies":[]}
