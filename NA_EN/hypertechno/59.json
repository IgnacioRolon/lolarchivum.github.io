(Story is Satire)","subforum":"General Discussion","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Disclaimer: It was written under boredom, and the story is satire.\r\n\r\nPew, so much to write. I don&#039;t care about this Pax convention, I know, you had good intention in mind. This is written for fun, boredom, and maybe as a prediction. The other one with the illegal stuff is there as a true statement that Riot did do something illegal, however, I filled the wrong Laws. I will be posting the exact cases Riot could be filed, at the end of this post.\r\n\r\nSince, China&#039;s businessmen and women, are more concerned about how to make money and doesn&#039;t care about Civil Justice as much, I wouldn&#039;t be too happy. I would have issued a call to Riot and told them to stop being immature. But Tencent wouldn&#039;t take action toward Riot, even if Tencent saw the angry peoples messages or got their calls.\r\n\r\n&quot;Good morning/Good afternoon, I&#039;m **** from Tencent, I&#039;m here to talk about an issue a small group of people announced. From what I have read, this Pax convention became indisputably controversial, something about gender equality. We have also been, noted. That an incident about a sexual assault towards a woman was done, by one of your, employees. Though we do not care much about the incident, the player base did, resulting in people leaving or losing trust in your company. There is no room for immaturity and this gender privilege nonsense. At the moment, I have checked you community report, and I&#039;m not happy about what I&#039;m seeing. Do you have any idea, what such childish behavior could lead too? It could lead to a decline in sales and ruined business. Fortunate for you, I still see a decent amount of players playing, and buying your game product. No action will be, taken. But, if I ever see this behavior again, and this lackluster of maturity and unprofessionalism, we will take the matter into our own hands.&quot;\r\n\r\nLaws, broken:\r\nTitle IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972.\r\nThe law states: &quot;No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.&quot;\r\nThey educated people, how to work in the gaming industry. As one person stated: &quot;If this was announced way earlier, that it was a special event created for women.&quot; This law would not effect. But DZK and other Rioters already approved that it was there to deny a gender, who bought tickets. Which, is looked upon, as stealing.\r\n|\r\nUnder federal anti-discrimination laws, businesses can refuse service to any person for any reason, unless the business is discriminating against a protected class.\r\n\r\nAt the national level, protected classes include:\r\nRace or color\r\nNational origin or citizenship status\r\nReligion or creed\r\nSex\r\nAge\r\nDisability, pregnancy, or genetic information\r\nVeteran status\r\n\r\nAgain, would not effect. If DZK and other Rioters shut their, mouth.\r\n\r\nWhich is, enough reason, for Riot to fire them. If a person or group wanted to sue, and they, aren&#039;t fired. It&#039;s an easy win.\r\nDZK and those Rioters, are the reason people can sue. In fact, Riot did nothing wrong, but their staff did. Which could, result in a horrible lawsuit for Riot, over something they didn&#039;t do. \r\n\r\nHence, why its always, personal opinion last in a company. DZK and those Rioters, have put Riot in a bad position, and not firing them will lead to undefendable bad consequences.\r\n\r\nAgain, my opinion is clear, I don&#039;t care. I know it was for a good cause, but firing DZK and those Rioters is in Riots, best interest. Not mine.","replies":[]}
