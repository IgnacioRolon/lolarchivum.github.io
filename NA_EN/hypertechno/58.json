I can be garbage or a god I do not mind either, just playing the game mostly for fun.\r\nI have now been playing the game for 2 years, and I see the same problem with the MMR system not rewarding players who did good on their own. Trust me Riot, not all teams are perfect and one or more players can be the result of the loss. My idea here is to decrease the number of trolling and actual good peoples downfall because he or she has no real way to carry them. \r\nNot only will this idea help decrease the number of trolls, but it will also increase peoples will in trying to get better at the game.\r\n\r\nMy thought was to give players with full honor or a grade of -S and higher Zero Lp loss if they lose the game. Does it sound fair for other players, no, but why should it be fair for the people who did not try? To make a team game fair you have to give the best player the reward of doing good and do not drag them down. This is the problem I see in Lol right now, good players not being rewarded for being good. I always feel terrible for losing a game where I had a person gaining a -S or higher and still losing Lp because I or my team could not get it together to win the damn game.\r\nThis could probably also help reduce tilts in the game, for certain people like me who hate letting a good teammate down.\r\n\r\nI also think this is what Lol needs right now, just winning a game is not enough of a reward. Knowing that you did good should be taken account.\r\n\r\nThe argument for this would be, but what if the champion they play is busted as F and they do good, why should they get a reward? See, my definition of busted in this game is massively different. Some think the champion is busted because they hate the champion, like Zoe, Yasuo, Riven, Quinn or any champion they just don&#039;t like for an example. Others look at their kit and their win rate and pick rate, to determine if the champion is busted. I&#039;m in the second category, on certain champions. Some I just hate and think is broken.\r\nBut as someone who is more in the second category, I have to break it to you. No, not every single champion is busted. Zoe is annoying because she can one-shot people, but she has plenty of counters to deal with her. Fizz is annoying because of his E, but you can bait his E to do a phenomenal gank or play. Garen can build almost everything, but you need massive game knowledge to play him correctly, though I do think his healing from his passive is a little stupid, but that&#039;s just me. \r\nOverall, most champion no matter if its Dota, Lol, Overwatch, or any game with characters with abilities. Most champions are going to be broken one way or another.\r\n\r\nBut I really do think Riot should reward players for doing good and punish people a lot more for doing bad or trolling. For example, if I end a game 1/7/1 then it is not just a bad day, it is me probably getting tilted and feeding my ass off, I should get punished for that. But if I end a game like this 1/7/12, I should not be punished. Why? Because look at the assist score, I may not have done a good job of staying alive and gaining kills, but I have been able to assist my team in getting kills. This means I still did good and tried to do something good for the team even though I lost my lane.\r\nBad players losing a game should lose more than the people who did well but still lost. This will increase the number of people trying to be a team player instead of them either AFK farm in jungle or lane. You can have a perfect Cs score, but what the fuck is that worth if you do not utilize it with your team.\r\nThis will limit people with poor MACRO play or mechanics being put into games with good players. It will also limit the need for smurfs boosting peoples account because if their client can&#039;t play the game for shit, the boosted person will drop really quickly back to where they belong.\r\n\r\nBut thats just my though, let me know what you think. \r\n\r\nHave a nice day.

My original thought was if your team honers you and get all four honers, you will get zero LP taken off your score. Making the 100% LP loss extremely rare, but your LP loss will only decrease by 2% for two honers, increasing it to 10% LP loss decrease if you get three. As a reward for playing frendly or as a leader.\nBut after some time I think that getting a 100% decrease will be too nice. Instead it should be 50% if you get all four honers.\nIf your LP loss or gain would depend on your honor level, then damn, that would be an extremely broken system then.\nThanks for you thought, it's good to see other people comment like this, it gave me a clarification on what I wrote wrong. \nTy, cheers. ;)","replies":[{"poster":"Echostormxx","date":"2018-02-21T01:24:35.152+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Haha, it's alright. I do the same sort of thing. The thing is you'll probably never get all 4 honors, especially if you're on a losing team. I guess that could make it somewhat balanced considering it would hardly ever happen, although it still might not fix the problem that you are presenting.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
