But this was genius. I was talking to my friends the other day, and we play Lol, of course. Then we came to the topic of skins, and how fun it would be if Riot created a custom skin creator software that would allow gamers to create there own skins.\r\nWe were all quite skeptical of the idea, but then I thought, &quot;That could be something Riot had a chance to expand on.&quot; People creating custom skins and people getting free access to all the skins, but with a weekly limit. For example, if I saw a Quinn skin I liked and wanted to try, I can, but only for a week. \r\nThis could lead to some creative skin concepts. Riot could make competitions, and get peoples creative side out, and the best skin concept made wins RP and will have their skin be designed at a professional level if it isn&#039;t already.\r\n\r\nRiot and skin creators alike could benefit from this. Think about the opportunities.\r\n\r\nLet me know what you all think. I would love to hear your thoughts about this idea.\r\n\r\nGLHF\r\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[{"poster":"Jesus is Savior","date":"2018-04-10T20:55:32.879+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot is actually doing the opposite, and killing the custom skins community (mapskins/wooxy/etc) through a security patch that is encrypting the League exe soon.","replies":[]},{"poster":"C9 Squeeky ","date":"2018-04-14T18:21:21.467+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Skins is how Riot makes most of their money.

I also think you may underestimate how costly it is to develop graphic arts software. So on top of having to make a department to filter through skin designs all day, they'd have to put in a large investment into a programming team. Also being able to try on skins in any mode that is multiplayer would see a decrease in skins sales, since people would more likely jump to the next free trial skin.

It can always be improved and get new features added or removed. When building a system, like the one I mentioned, you never want to rush. The system will cost more, and many unfixable bugs could occur.\n\nIf their program team were, inadequate. Then, your statement is true. \n\nHowever, for what I have observed their team has built many phenomenal games, and have kept the game from bugging quite well. I dought there would be a problem. When; it comes to development.\n\nRegulating the skins are a lot harder, but be honest. How many players do you see picking a nude or dick skin? Matter of fact, even creating or wanting those skins? You will probably be reported or banned on the spot.\n\nSkin sales would most likely stay the same since Riot would focus on taking already made skins down. A business growth; comes from competition. Creating their own will force them to do better.\n\nhttp://boardofwisdom.com/cachetogo/images/quotes/5924.png\n\nIt sounds counterintuitive, but that how we as humans learn, create, expand, and improve. Competition and the determination to do better than others and becoming better than others is what made us humans climb the food chain in the first place. Nowadays we are greedy, not competitive.\n\nThanks for you reply.
