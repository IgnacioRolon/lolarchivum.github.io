No for real, if you really have nothing good to say then why are you even playing the game?\r\n\r\nWhat I love.\r\nBut I do like how they try to improve the game and keep it fresh. This is what makes Lol diffrent from so many other games and also keeps Riot from making a Lol2, keep an old game an improve it over time instead of making the game completly new.\r\nThey make champion reworks.\r\nThey do map updates. They came out with the jungle update here in 2016.\r\nThey made the new runes. And actualy I want more than just the five. This new rune system is so great, because now they can add, fix, or delete runes much easier than before.\r\nJust love how they improve.\r\n\r\nThe new champions are actualy fun and creative. Give them a break the new champions they have releast are fenominal, Illovi (Fuck Illovi, I still want her deleted, but when you play her its just so much fun seeing people tilt just because you hit them with your E, I am so sorry.) Camille, Kled, Xayha and Rakan. And Zoe, oh my, people hate her so much, but truth be tolled, I main her. She is everything I wanted in a champion, massive burst that can one-shot squshy champions, and infuriating E that can do double damage, and is not as safe as the retared ass fish Fizz. Fuck Fizz and the people who say he is balanced. No champions is balanced when they can do triple damage and almost one shot a tank, Zoe can only half health a tank. If you really want to say Zoe is broken then try to play her, I will say with {{champion:86}} tee, you will feed most of your games if you do not play her as a bitch. She has no real escape unless if you are really lucky. Her early game damage sucks, and her power %%%%% only hits when you build your void staff or deathcap as your third item.\r\n\r\nWhat I hate the most.\r\nFor fuck sake, just balance some of those mage champions. If I have to be real I have never had an issue with mages like Zoe, Syndra, Karthus, and Azir. Because it takes good time to get good at the champions. Mages like, Malz, Hime are a diffrente story. Hime is safe like Azir. Except, Azir is not overtuned and super ranged like Hime. A Hime with somewhat of a brain can just place three turret at the correct place and wola, almost unkillable. Because if you go aggro, half health and Hime full. You are littraly forced to play safe, loss a massives amout of CS and be weak for almost the intire game because you can not collect the gold to get items you need to be usefull. \r\nMalz is just fucking annoying. Hey, want to never be able to play and want to be a usless peace of shit all game? Then call the Malzhar service, {{champion:86}}teed to make you suffer and give me a great laught, like the actual little depresst son of a bitch I am. Fuck everything Malz can do, fuck that he is even a fucking champion, he is the littral largest cock blocker I have ever seen, even with the little nerf he got on his ult. He is still massively overloaded, and can take any champion on with out breaking a sweet. Marksman with range, puff, squshi killed with an R, tank kill with a E,W,Q,R combo, other mages, puff, killed with R, teamfight, puff, got my team will R your carry probably die in the progress, but now your team is dead. \r\nYou want to know witch champion can do everything better than everysingle champion, its Malz. He laugths at Fioras W, laughts at Garens Q, laughts at fucking every champion with his R. He is this fucking busted I either dodge or ban the living shit of this champion. There may be a magical way to beat a Malz, but I am sure it only works with a spesific champion combo.\r\nHuh, I need to stop complaining about champions, but plz, that nerf did not make Malz any less annoying, He is a dumb as fuck champion that needs a fix.","replies":[]}
