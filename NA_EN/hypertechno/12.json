I do not, dislike Hashinshin, he is an entertainer and does have some valid points. However, he talked about Fortnite and compared it to League. \r\nThere is a lot of things he is getting wrong. After, a couple of Fortnite players complains and issues. I can tell you. League, is doing a much better job, than Fortnite at the moment. As a player who hasn&#039;t played Fortnite, the things I see in the trailers are, you build, and you fight to win. But from what I can understand from the Fortnite players are, you only need to fight, nevermind building because it will get nerfed. Why not call it PUBG 2.0 then? Every gun except, semi-auto or automatic, are getting nerfed to the ground. How the fuck is that suppose to be fun? I can&#039;t even use a sniper rifle to fuck over unknowing players. A rifle is, suppose to one-shot. Nevermind, I won&#039;t be playing a game that rejects fun.\r\n\r\nWhat almost got me into playing Fortnite was the building option. But, after all the complaints about it being constantly nerfed drow me away. It was such an original idea in a Battle Royal game, but guess the creators though otherwise.\r\n\r\nWhat Hashinshin is suggesting is that League should take the same risks. Why? I have heard nothing but complaints about the changes they made in Fortnite. Fortnite doesn&#039;t know what the fuck they are doing, from what I can understand. So the suggestion is quite stupid, and not well thought out. \r\nThen there is the fact that Fortnite is a, very, easy genre of games. How they manage to piss off, this many people is unbelievable. League is a harder genre of games and the fact they have kept it alive and still very popular, more so than Doda and Doda II, is impressive. So don&#039;t come and tell me, a recently popular game that has been successful since early 2018 and now almost dying, knows better than a game that has been popular since 2011 and still is till this day.\r\n\r\nIF ANYTHING, Fortnite should take notes from League.","replies":[]}
