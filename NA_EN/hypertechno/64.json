(There is too much in this event idea, it may not even be available long after the Swain update has been released.) \n\nBecause of the Swain update, this idea struck me, why not make an event that is themed around the neighboring rivalry. Riot could even make a beautiful map for it to. One side represents Demacia and the other Noxus. I was thinking Demacia on the Dragon pit side and Noxus on the Baron pit side. But I do not have a clear picture of how the map would look like. They can also do those event maps they usually make, for example, the Star Guardian and Project event maps. They could make one for this event too.\n\nFor this event, every Demacian and Noxian champion with a rival form Demacia or Noxus gets a skin. \n\nSwain and Jarvan IV\nGaren and Darius\nGalio and Sion\nQuinn and Talon\n\nThe champion listed here do not really have a rival form Demacia or Noxus (Do write in the comments, if I am wrong.):\nKatarina\nLux\nDraven\nPoppy\nFiora #\nShyvana #\nSona #\nLucian #\nVayne\nXin Zhao\nKled (Kled just hates everyone.) #\nCassiopeia #\nLeblanc\nRiven #\nVladamir\n\nBut here are some champion rivals I made if they were rivals:\nLux and Draven\nKatarina and Poppy\nLeblanc and Xin Zhao\nVladamir and Vayne\n\nThe champions with &quot;#&quot; on the side either did not work or has an existing rival that would make them unable to have a Demacian or Noxian rival.\n\nThis, however, I do not think is enough. Small short stories on how they meet and became rivals should also be added to the event. Just to make people who love reading their champions lore could get a kick out of reading it. (This is just an option that could be added to the event if Riot thought it was a good idea. Stories can take time to build and making this many is huge.)\n\nI hade many more ideas for the event, but I can forget quite quick so there are a lot of things that are not added in or not finished. So if you guys have any good ideas to add, plz do share.","replies":[{"poster":"zrWQMdGHtY","date":"2018-01-21T11:32:35.796+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Casual reminder that we need a Noxian Civil war event before a Noxus vs Demacia.

As Noxus has more issues inside than outside the boarders atm.\n\nTruth to that. The problem I see with this is just, why make it focused on one group of people? But I do see lots of potential in this idea, it would also fit the Swain rework a lot more. Because Swain did come to power thanks to the civil war, so yeah, I would love to see that first before the Demacia Vs Noxus.\n\nI knew that Katarina and Garen were rivals, it just so happens I did not want to piss off people. But it seems like that idea has died off.\n\nIn certain areas they are similar, both will kill anybody who is in their way, they both like to stape, and they are both from honored families. The difference lies in they are both from rival countries, one seeks for honor and the other seeks the enjoyment of killing. In terms of culture and believes they are completely different, but I am sure that Fiora would be like Kat if she was from Noxus, and Kat would be like Fiora if she was from Demacia. \n\nBut that just comes down to people, I am a Fiora and Kat main, well for situational cases. So I should know some stuff about my champions, but I know more about Quinn, Camille, Galio, Poppy, and Zoe. Because they are my actual mains. Sorry, I am an asshole I main Quinn and Zoe, but they are just so much fun, not for the enemy of course, but I enjoy damage. Damage and damage, pure burst and damage.","replies":[{"poster":"zrWQMdGHtY","date":"2018-01-21T16:59:41.775+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Katarina is arrogant, but not cruel to her people, not to her enemy. While Fiora is cruel to anyone who's poor. Katarina kills, because it's her duty, even if she enjoys it. But she still withstands of doing it. While Fiora would challenge you to death only for spilling some wine on her cape.\nThey may looks similar but in truth they are way too different. Kat wouldn't like a bigger arrogant B than her. And as it's mentioned Kat is a whinny B, like me. So she's not fit to even have friends, while the nobles love Fiora, cause... I mean she likes rich people... Idk why, but that's pissing me off xD\n\nAnd dw. Yi mains act as they know the lore perfectly and speak about Kat's feelings as if they are not just casual Yi mains and we know what Yi mains are in truth...","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"zrWQMdGHtY","date":"2018-01-21T01:15:18.074+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Katarina is rival with Garen...

But yes, they are rivals.\n\nThe reason exactly why I thought Fiora would not work was the reason you commented about, but as one comment suggested Fiora could be the rival of Katarina because their personalities are similar. \n\nWhen I added Leblanc in I asked myself if she would be a good idea, because of your exact reason. But because she is allied with Swain I thought that she would still fight alongside Swain.\n\nCassiopeia, in my opinion, now belongs more towards the Shuriman lore than the Noxian lore.\n\nRiven already had an event with Yasuo. But she could work, however, I would not add her.","replies":[{"poster":"zrWQMdGHtY","date":"2018-01-21T09:49:24.343+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kat and Fio are nothing alike.

I like your idea though, except, I would save Fiora for a Fiora vs Jax event and get two mindblowing skins for both Fiora and Jax. \n\nThe main reasons I left Shyvana out is almost the same as your idea of Poppy. The difference between the two is; Poppy was found and trained by a Demacian soldier, where she even learned the Demacian way of thinking, fighting, and honer. Poppy has also been gifted the hammer that symbolizes The Hero of Demacia when her teacher died. While Shyvana just popped up because she had a mother problem, saved the king from the Noxians, and then was counted as a Demacian. :P\n\nThe reason of Xin Zhao is to prof his worth as a Demacian, by fighting LeBlanc one of the strongest mages in Noxus. While Shyvana would just take any command Jarvan would give her and fuck LeBlanc up in no time.\n\nI do not know what it is with me and Shyvana, I just for some stupid reason hate her and I do not want her to a part of it. Forgive me. But I like your ideas and I would consider the Fiora and Katarina over the Poppy and Katarina.","replies":[{"poster":"GhaelWinds","date":"2018-01-21T04:31:47.856+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I get that reasoning but I feel you're shortcoming the Shyvana lore. Poppy does have more significance than I gave her but idk Poppy is weird to include because she doesn't give anything to the Demacian State. \n\nJarvan was saved by Shyvana and then he subsequently saved her. She is fiercely loyal to him because he gave her a place to live against his people's customs and beliefs. To me having Shyvana fight LeBlanc is almost the difference between loyalty gained through trust and loyalty gained through mutual benefits. The themes are interesting to expand on in that regard.\n\nI do think Poppy would definitely belong in it though I'm just at a loss of who to rival her with.
