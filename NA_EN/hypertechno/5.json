I can see Vladimir and Soraka. But why now? They would have been perfect for the next upcoming Dawnbringer vs Nightbringer skin line. It was a cool skin line, but that just destroyed it for me.\n\nLee Sin makes no sense and would fit the Dawnbringer line, with maybe a former rival or Noxian evildoer. Nidalee should be pared against some other evildoer. \n\nWhy are these even here? This out left flank and unwanted. These should have been saved for a later date for hype, to sell more. Have everyone at Riot forgotten how to run a business? I love Riots skin team, they can be the most creative, but come on. A waste of time, creativity, and money. \n\nJust my opinion, what you guys think?","replies":[{"poster":"Arakadia","date":"2019-11-29T03:11:49.783+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Random boards user thinks he knows business better than a billion dollar international company's professional marketing team. Whats new?\n\nA lot of your points are rather silly. Nidalee doesn't need to be paired against an evil doer, because the whole point of Nightbringer is to make them an \"evil doer\". The whole point of skins is to change the character into something they aren't, and occasionally that means making them a \"bad guy\". Lee Sin doesn't have to be a Dawnbringer just because he's a \"good guy\" in the lore. In fact Nightbringer makes more sense and is a direct reference to his Runeterra lore, where he naively sought power, became overly arrogant, and struggles to control the fierceness of the dragon spirit. \n\nBeyond that misunderstanding, you aren't really clear what you don't like about the skins. WDYM when you ask why the skins were picked? They were picked for the same reason nearly all skins are picked, to varying degrees, because Riot thought they were cool and would sell money.","replies":[{"poster":"HyperTechno","date":"2019-11-29T05:42:38.434+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have no problem with the skins, in fact, I love them. However, too many skins are made for a skin line considered a pair. One representing the side of order and the other destruction. Suddenly, 6 champions for a skin line considered a pair, with high quality are advertised.\n\nThe sugar rush skins look pleasing, for the simple reason, it is new and is not a pair. Meaning it will sell better, because they can do quantities instead of quality. Skins are a main income, and function like a patron, therefore must keep players interested. This means quality for a fair price, and players to buy, which mean satisfying all their players - to the best of their ability - or they won’t pay. \n\nI am no business genius, but I know the fundamental parts, while known how not drive customers away. Riot almost screwed themselves on Twitter, tell pros that they need League to be anything, yet League needs them to exist. Telling people (primarily men) to F off in their convention. Sexism scandals, etc. I look like a business guru compared to their business decisions. Luckily, for Riot, the fan base is sorta forgiving, and Riot is quite large. If this was any other game, owned by a single game company, it would be out of business. The player base loyalty is powerful, the convention tested those waters. The fact, that people did not sue Riot after their stupidity and clear US violation off denial of paid service, and # Amendment, should show the player loyalty, even with all the toxic BS. At some point people will legitimately leave, which is happening already slowly but steady. This is not all because of their poor business practices, it’s natural, but it did speed it up. Their new games are not going to cut it either, maybe for the Hearthstone inspired game, but the FPS is competing with COD, Fort, BF, CS Go, and Overwatch. Other damming factors could be Riots terrible record with League at the moment, so yea, best of luck to Riot.\n\nFor Lee it is more of a personal take on the champion. I happen to be on the side of Lee representing order. His golden skin is f*ing dumb, God Lee exist. I would rather have Vladimir or Karma.","replies":[]}]}]}
