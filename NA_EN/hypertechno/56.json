Mundo, I would love buffed, however, you have to take into account that he will become a monster if, buffed in the wrong places.\r\n\r\nThe other champions I can agree on, and I would love seeing Jarvan again. \r\n\r\nNerf wise, Galio should just be turned back to what he was before all this nonsense. A few tweaks here and there and he would be perfect for Solo and Pro play without being OP as a tank.\r\n\r\nAs for {{item:3916}} I do not see a reason for it being nerfed. But whatever reason you have I will go with it. \r\n\r\nHonestly, Akali was an easy fix how you guys manage to fuck it up is beyond me. Keep the True Stealth, but keep it as a defensive option only, and buff some of her sustain or damage.\r\n\r\nDisagreement:\r\nRenekton; For his already clear presents and stable win rate. He is in no need for a buff or nerf.\r\n\r\nSplit Opinion:\r\n{{item:3916}}; I do not see a reason to. It helps but does not make Mages OP. It may also be me being biased for being a mage main, but I do not see a reason to since one MR item is enough to negate all that MP and Damage. Honestly, I say go for it, but be careful about the change.\r\n\r\nAgreement:\r\nEverything else really, nothing looks silly. I understand where they want to go with it, and I would love to see what they give.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading, if there is anything you agree with or disagree with, let me know.\r\n\r\nGL HF\r\n\r\n{{sticker:vlad-salute}}","replies":[]}
