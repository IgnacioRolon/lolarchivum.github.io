(Single and Multiplayer)","subforum":"Concepts & Creations","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean, they have maps of the states, pictures of the states, and a story base for all the states so why not utilize that to make the player see all of it as a champion you can create and develop. Completing missions and all of that, it could also be a great Offline thing for people who want to play Lol but have no available internet. \n\nThis could also give Riot more of a challenge and maybe even open up new ideas for upcoming updates, patches, or even new maps for Lol. It could also put the Art and 3D facility to the test, and the people who create the stories will be put to a test, tell us the story of Runetera and all its states with MPC&#039;s in the streets, missions, and shops.\n\nI know, not everyone is into story game modes. That is completely understandable. But a story mode could give a little more light to what is Runetara and peoples culture is. Also, seeing how someones favorite champion lived. The culture, the environment, and lifestyle (Poor or Rich). Yes, there are pictures that illustrate the places, but I do not get the complete feel for how it is. It could just be me.\n\nHowever, this type of projects does not come cheap. This does not only takes time but also takes a good amount of money to create. So this type of game mode may not be free to play. But, if the community really wants it, it could happen if the community donates for the funding to make the game mode free to play. But it also comes down to, if Riot wants to put time and effort into it.\n\nI think the game mode would be great, but if no one thinks it fits or Riot do not feel like putting time into it then that is fine. This idea just came to me as a, what if, after playing a game of ARAM and seeing the video for the new Varus Bio. \n\nPlz, do share your opinion. And Riot, if you think this could be a good project and you want me to share some ideas for you, I will gladly help. \n\nThank you for reading and hope you have a wonderful day. \n\nGL HF\n\nHyperTechno.","replies":[{"poster":"SamBunzly","date":"2017-12-01T19:49:50.511+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like the idea, honestly love it. There's a big issue with it though. Multiple champions have very extensive backstories, often times including places that are unique and special to them. Champions from the void, for example, would require maps located in the void, and therefore take away from the player's imagination of what the void is like. Likewise, this kinda guts every players ideas of what specific places look like. \n\nAnother issue, as you stated, would be the money. The funding needed to give every champion his/her own story mode would be phenomenal. This includes its own issue as well. Growth. In this game mode, how would you grow? You likely wouldn't be able to effectively, as RPG games play much differently than MOBA's, and leveling within would just cause too great of a headache to outweigh the rewards that you MAY get from making this.\n\nWhile I love the idea, I can very nearly guarantee that Riot won't be adding a story mode to League of Legends.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sk√øy","date":"2017-12-01T17:26:03.773+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Interesting idea but I don't think riot would ever go for it!","replies":[]}]}
