I would fit Quinns Assassin type of playstyle a lot more. I would make her bit more viable mid as well.\r\nIf it becomes too powerful, they could remove the damage from her E, and she will only damage an enemy if marked. \r\n\r\nWishes, not part of the questions:\r\n(I know she is quite strong, no need to explain, you can leave your thought on the ideas, I would love to hear what you think.)\r\n\r\n* I would love her W to loss the Attack Speed, but an increase to her Movement Speed bonus, and when Behind Enemy Lines is Active an enemy can still be marked and increase her movement speed towards that enemy.\r\n\r\n* Make the E a stun instead of a slow, or at least increase the length and strength of it.\r\n\r\n* Turn down the damage on her Passive, but increase her AD scaling. Her farming is laughable, or make her Q and R mark all minions hit. \r\n\r\n* Make her Ult movement speed and damage scale by AP max health damage, with the W bonuses having AP scalings if you do not want to remove Quinns Attack Speed bonus. (It will make On-hit Quinn an option for the ADC Quinn mains, I think it would be great. Because then they have to focus on getting on-hit items, making it less focused on the passive.)\r\n\r\nIf a Quinn main wants to build Assassin Quinn, let the Passive and ability combos do the main damage.\r\nOr\r\nIf a Quinn main wants to build ADC Quinn, let the AA, Ult, and W help do the damage. You may have to nerf the Q AP scaling though.\r\nOr\r\nIf a Quinn main wants to build AP Quinn, everything but her passive and E will do the damage.","replies":[{"poster":"MarkedOfKane","date":"2018-11-15T01:38:42.768+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please no.","replies":[]}]}
