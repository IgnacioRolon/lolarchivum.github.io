This event made up for the Project event. Even though I hate Nasus and WW, the skins make them look really cool and makes me want to play them, even if I think they are cancer as hell.\r\nI have talked a lot about how Riot picks champions that already have too many skins or has a skin that is already too good to make the new one fantastic. I was worried about the Lux skin, mostly because of the elemental skin. The new Lux skin was just like what I worried about, I do not like it as much, but the storyline behind it and with the two amazing looking Nasus and WW skins, it made up for is lag of hype. So I would still buy the skin, not because of how it looks, but because of the amazing hype you gave me with the Nasus and WW skins. \r\n\r\nI like the new border system. Instead of people being able to buy it right off the bat, they have to work for it. Making the border way more valuable to the person who unlocked it, by playing the game and finishing missions. So I am all in on that.\r\n\r\nRiot, you still amaze me. Even though I have some questions for you balancing team, ignoring my champion Quinn, and some of your skins choices. You fix your mistakes and try to do your best.\r\n\r\nGood thinks I love about Riot:\r\nThe art, stories, new or reworked champions (Camille, Galio, Xayah, Rakan, Urgot, Swain, and my new favorite champion and one trick Zoe.), the constant changing meta, when missions came into the game I was happy, many of the past events you had (Specifically the Riven and Yasuo event), still caring about the community, and most of all the new Runes.\r\n\r\nNo matter how much dumb shit Riot do sometimes, Riot makes up for with a lot of good. It may not be the game it once was but it sure as hell is still a fun game to play with your friends.\r\n\r\nSo I say to you Riot after all my complaints and all my negative shit, thank you for still making the game enjoyable. Thank you for actually trying and caring about your community. Thank you for all the fantastic stories I have read, and most of all thank you for giving me a game I can play to have some fun with, \r\nand with my friends. \r\n\r\nAgain thank you.","replies":[]}
