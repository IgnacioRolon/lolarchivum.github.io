The meta and the changes are coming in random directions. Creating a big frustration bobble that drives the lust for playing the game down. Tho the pace has been slowed down, the changes are still incredibly random, or right out pointless. None the less it&#039;s easier to adapt, but there is still, no systematic sense in the chances. How will this affect the game, what is the purpose, does it make sense, and who will it effect. These questions are the fundamentally important questions you have to ask yourself, before doing any change. No matter if it&#039;s a person, company, or government. You are responsible for what will happen to the game, and if the people will come back and play the game. If you can&#039;t understand even that simple reality, you are not qualified to do the changes of a game. If Riot fails, you are to blame. Not the designers, not the artists, not the community, or the CEO. The CEO hired you, to keep the game under control. He has put his trust under you, and if the game fails it&#039;s on you and he loses the game and his money.\r\n\r\n- I love LoL, but the balance team makes it hard:\r\n        Champions are given random nerfs and buffs. Shen&#039;s Q was, apparently, nerfed from 30% to 15%-30% (Depending on level) for no reason at all. He wasn&#039;t strong, a pain to deal with, or anything for that matter. But, nerfed him none the less. Yi now got buffed, despite the backlash. Braum is getting nerfed, and Ryze, well they hate Ryze. The ADC change became pointless, the Runes are either useless or overpowered, and are never buffed or nerfed reasonably. There are only item order and no versatility, and they are like the runes useless or overpowered. The runes and items need significant change, it isn&#039;t fun to run an already working build over and over again on the same champions or different. There is a need for versatility in runes and items, right now, so players can go with more than one item build. People even stress that extensively, how this keeps flying by is a surprise. Oh, wait, Reddit. Sigh.\r\n\r\n- They focus too much on the LCS and Reddit for balancing:\r\n        LCS and Reddit are not always right, from time to time it is, but as a proper way to balance champions and a game is a misunderstanding. There are articles that, talk about this and think the same way, no matter if it&#039;s Overwatch, Hearthstone, Street Fighter, and so on. People have regularly, encountered rejecting changes if a game is too focused on Pro play or a biased website with, very one-sided opinions. That&#039;s why I suggest that players from all ranks are part of the balancing team, and not just Pro&#039;s, and you focus on the board more so than Reddit. Because then every ranked player gets a say and no one is left out, and you have access to more versatile opinions or even ideas. The **BOARDS** is also a lot easier to access than Reddit.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, am I right about everything? No. Do I want my voice to be heard? Yes. \r\nI don&#039;t like the direction of the game, and I&#039;m afraid I won&#039;t be coming back. Even after all the comebacks, the game has done. I&#039;m tired, and I feel left out. I can&#039;t get myself to play one single game, a game I found fun, only kills me now. It&#039;s a phenomenal game, but you in balance team can&#039;t seem to agree.\r\n\r\nSorry, if I wasted your time. If you agree, tell us why, same if you disagree.\r\n\r\nGL HF, keep playing the game if you love the game. I&#039;m not going to stop you. This my choice and mine alone, I don&#039;t like where Riot is going, if you do, fine by me.\r\n\r\n{{sticker:vlad-salute}}","replies":[]}
