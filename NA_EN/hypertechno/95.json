Warring Kindoms Quinn.","subforum":"Concepts & Creations","up_votes":19,"down_votes":3,"body":"I did not make this image, but this looks like Quinn too much. It could make an idea for how a Warring Kindoms Quinn could look like.\nhttps://i.redd.it/sp1cm3bkm4dy.jpg\n\nThis concept was for a Smite champion, nerver played Smite. But could be used to make an idea for how the skin could be created.\n\nLooks to much like Phoenix Quinn? Well, here is some small diffrences. \n\nPhoenix: fire and rebirth. Warring Kindoms: glory and strength.\nPhoenix: turns to ash when she dies. Warring Kindoms: Valor flys down picks Quinn up and flys her back to the kindom to be healed and back to the fountan where she will continue her fight.\nPhoenix: Quinn is picked up by Valor. Warring Kindoms: Valor flys down, but transform into Quinn's wings.\nPhoenix: She does not look like a Goddess. Warring Kindoms: Quinn is a demi-goddess.\n\nSince Valor is not part of the concept, because its a Smite concept, here is an image of how he could look like if this where to happen. LOL, like it would.\nhttps://cgimg.s3.amazonaws.com/t/g84/563184/1256706_83618_large.jpg\n\nAnyway, hope you have a lovely day, and GG and GL HF in every game.","replies":[{"poster":"Sexy Jack Rabbit","date":"2017-12-29T08:11:05.846+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's Jing Wei from smite.

Heartseeker was a fail because of her default hunched back of notre dame stance.\n\nThat can be easily reanimated with the skin. With the way Riot makes skins right now, this issue should not be a problem. They did a few animation changes to the Dawnbringer and Nightbringer skins. However, they are small.\n\nBut, this is not to say they would not do it to the Warring Kindoms skin. Because if the hunched back ruins the skin, then they should come up with a solution.\n\nOr, they could reanimate Quinns walking animation completly, but that would be a waist of time, so why not add it to the skin only.\n\nBut, I like how you stated a problem that could ruin the skin. Because, yeah, the hunched back could be a problem. I just think Riot would reanimte her walk with the skin to solve the problem and to make the skin beautiful.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SalamencÄ™","date":"2017-12-29T22:59:15.035+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Who?","replies":[]},{"poster":"HalcyonDweller","date":"2017-12-29T19:57:05.681+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hot damn I haven't heard about smite in a while, better go try it out this weekend!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Potato Doc","date":"2017-12-29T16:37:53.737+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She looks a lot like pyrrha from RWBY","replies":[]}]}
