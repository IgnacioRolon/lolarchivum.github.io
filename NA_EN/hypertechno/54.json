But I think it could work. (If there are any, pro players who are willing to test it for fun on a draft game and give me feedback that would be great. I will be testing it too.)\r\n\r\nThe build is kinda late game-ish, and I found on the PBE that a full combo, R-W-Q-E-Ignite-AAx4 dealt about 3800 Magic damage with a full build. While still remaining tanky, thanks to the armor, Mr, and her W.\r\n\r\nBut essentially, your three important items are:\r\n{{item:3089}} {{item:3115}} {{item:3091}}.\r\n\r\nStart:\r\n{{item:1056}} {{item:2003}} \r\n\r\nBoots:\r\n{{item:3047}} {{item:3020}} {{item:3111}} \r\n\r\nOffensive items:\r\n{{item:3151}} {{item:3056}} {{item:3285}} \r\n\r\nDefensive Items:\r\n{{item:3068}} {{item:3193}} {{item:3143}} \r\n\r\nEnforcer items:\r\n{{item:3100}} {{item:3124}} \r\n\r\nTell me in the comments if you think its troll or viable.","replies":[{"poster":"Tegash","date":"2018-11-08T01:33:18.741+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"See my other comment [below](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/qnPtdP7M-champion-builds-mid-ap-on-hit-bruiser-leona?comment=00010000).\n\nRabadon's and Nashor's are definitely great items, but I think the build can be tweaked. Other than that, this build is _definitely_ viable. AP toplane Leo has been played for a long time and they ain't about to stop lol.\nSo first things first, if you're against an AP lane, you're gonna wanna rush {{item:3001}} . It'll keep you alive against their poke and give you some tank stats/survivability.\nIf you're against an AD heavy lane, you want {{item:3157}} . It'll help get you through early. If you need to spam cast your abilities, just get the {{item:3191}} and then start on {{item:3802}} .\nFinally, if you're against a tank, feel free to rush either {{item:3285}} or {{item:3003}} , whichever you prefer or think will help you more against the enemy team.\nYou're going to want {{item:3001}} regardless, but you don't have to rush it if you don't need to. Zhonya's on the other hand is completely optional.\n\nAfter that, your build varies. If you're going sustain AP bruiser, as you prefer in your initial statement, your build will look something like this:\n\n{{item:3001}} {{item:3091}} {{item:3100}} {{item:3151}} {{item:3115}} , {{item:3111}} / {{item:3047}} \n\nIf you're going burst AP assassin, it will look more like this:\n\n{{item:3285}} {{item:3100}} {{item:3089}} {{item:3135}} {{item:3165}} , {{item:3020}} \n\nThese are the two extremes, and your build can be either or anywhere in between. But these are good places to start.\n\nHappy hunting. :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ahpe","date":"2018-11-08T00:04:53.665+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"It's troll because her passive is useless unless you get ganked, she deals absolutely no damage early game and she has bad AP ratios.","replies":[{"poster":"Tegash","date":"2018-11-08T01:15:49.257+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm... not sure where you're getting the \"bad AP ratios\" from.\n\nHer ratio on Q is 30%, yes. But since she's a Lich Bane builder, because her Q is an AA empower, Lich Bane effectively increases her Q AP ratio to 80%, which is huge. You get close to 1000 AP on her with that, that's 800 scaling damage and 110 base.\n\nHer W and E have 40% AP ratios respectively, but they both have 220 base damage, which is respectable. Even with a smallish AP amount, like 400,  that's still almost 400 magic damage per hit of each ability.\n\nHer R has an 80% AP scaling in an AoE and a base damage of 250. With Luden's that's basically a one-shot to any squishy in the game, and if not you can instantly follow up for a kill. In _addition_ to that, her ult empowers her next 3/4/5 autos, essentially giving her a whopping _95% AP scaling_ on Q with Lich Bane pop, and an extra 50 magic damage on top per hit.","replies":[{"poster":"Ahpe","date":"2018-11-08T03:08:47.945+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"1.

Yeah, it doesn't give her anything in lane. Great for ganks but otherwise pbbththth.

Nobody... said this was in the midlane. I specifically made recommendations for Leona _top._ And besides, 90% of her matchups in bot are ranged too, and she does just fine.\n\n3. Building AP you're going to be hitting 40% CDR optimally. That 6 second Q will become 3.5, letting her proc Lich Bane on it multiple times in a fight very easily. Her W will go from 10 to 6, meaning she can use it twice in a fight (which she won't need to if she bursts them down hard enough and theyre not a tank). Her E will go down to 5 seconds, meaning you can never get away from her unless you're a champ like Camille or Kai'Sa. And her R will be at an unholy 35 second cooldown. It will be up every fight, every pick, and every kill.","replies":[{"poster":"Ahpe","date":"2018-11-08T21:44:37.055+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Tegash,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=qnPtdP7M,comment-id=0001000000000000,timestamp=2018-11-08T04:35:03.943+0000)\n>\n> 1.

It's not optimal to play her kit solo so if you're already with ally why not just build tank and offer more to your team?\n> \n> 2. Nobody... said this was in the midlane.
