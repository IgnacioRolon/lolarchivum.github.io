Akali is not OP, but people are annoyed about her W, and Riot has noticed it. They are looking for ways to change her W. As a Champion Concept Creator, this is a great opportunity. So I will share my ideas.\n\nIn all honesty, I think Akali having True Stealth would be a good part of her kit. But, making that the case, I must look for ways to balance it out.\n\n****Shroud:****\nAkali pops a smoke screen and is in True Stealth for 6 seconds. If Akali should be revealed and return into stealth, she will no longer return into True Stealth for the rest of Shrouds duration.\n\n* Energy Regeneration: Removed - (Balancing)\n\n* Bonus Movement Speed: Increased - (Escape)\n\n* New: Enemies who entered the smoke, are slowed - (Escape)\n\n* New: Akali takes 10% less damage when in the shroud - (Make up for the loss of permanent True Stealth)\n\n****Reason:****\nHer W&#039;s strength comes from her being able to return into True Stealth, regardless of her, being revealed. Letting her enter True Stealth once a shroud, will increase the risk factor. Turret diving an enemy would be far riskier if Akali were to use her shroud incorrectly. You dive, you try to kill, and then you shroud. Increasing the counterplay methods if she were to fail. Same in the lane, if she pops her shroud and attacks you, placing a control ward would reveal her placement, and make her targetable.\n\nThis means, however, that her damage or sustain must be buffed. Akali is a turret diver, rewarding her for making a successful turret dive should be the case. But that, I will let Riot decide, I wrote this to give a W change idea.\n\nIf you want me to give a full fletched change, tell me down below, and I will give everything I have in mind for an Akali change and ways to make her strong, but balanced.","replies":[{"poster":"3TWarrior","date":"2018-12-08T03:56:48.592+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"actually, someone else posted a rather brilliant idea that instead of her shroud just making her immune to turrets, she would still be invisible (keeping her uniqueness) but the turret would target and damage her, giving away her location and still keeping her in line with the fundamentals of the game\n\nnot sure of other things which show stealth though, but true stealth is a ridiculously powerful mechanic","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mr Elessar","date":"2018-12-07T22:14:19.035+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"I'd remove true stealth and bring back true sight.","replies":[{"poster":"nfzeta","date":"2018-12-07T22:18:59.353+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"I think the true stealth should stay.

It’s not very fun not being able to play the champ you like. \n\nI don’t play Akali but I definitely understand what it’s like not being able to play who you like.","replies":[{"poster":"nfzeta","date":"2018-12-07T22:38:01.966+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem would be you then remove what a lot of people like about the champion.
