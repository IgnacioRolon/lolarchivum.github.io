No wonder the community gets mad, Riot hasnt done anything they asked.\n\ntbh, treat others the way you want to be treated. Riot may have treated us like shit, but we should be the better side. If we treat them fairly, respectfully, and kindly it will give them the only option to treat us the same way. It will also make our future complaints look legitimate, because 75% of the stuff I see are from players who do not play, or right out trolls for click bait. I am also sure that we agree with the same things.\n\nBruisers do not oneshot, but they sure as hell do way too much for so little risk. Jax, Urgot, you know what I mean.\n\nThe Yasuo buff thing was Riot trolling during April. They never wanted that buff, it never even hit PBE and was even write as a troll by Riot. I just found it funny, how people reacted towards it.\n\nJanna is garbage at the moment, I rarely see her, but when I do, its usual a win for me. The 25% of your health is even a massive stretch, maybe 10% but that is when your ahead. The only time, I see a Janna doing damge, is when I play ARAM.\n\nRiot Games is not defined by its staff, but its community. The way there community acts, is the way they act. Trust me, Riot does respond on the Deve, they just do not want to talk directly on the board for the fear of being shamed by the whole community over a small thing. I will bet you 100$, if they try to tell you why Akali's shroud is actually balanced and how to counter it, a shit storm of anger will fly towards them with disagreement and disappointment. Riot is filled with good people, who want to help, but the community is too aggressive. I told a Rioter once, that his effort will not solve anything other than creating more hatred. I believe he had good intentions, but the community will fight it with smears. \n\nEpic Games, forgot the game wtf, only step on it because the game is still young and they sure as hell have not keep the petal down for 9 years. Riot is over working, season 7, 8, and probably season 9 will prove it. At this time, yes, they need all the sympathy we can give them, because they have been working none stop for 9 years to reach expectations.\n\nBasically, you want better change?

Whatever made you come to that conclusion, you need to find out why. I merely stated that many people say, Riot does not listen, when in fact, they do. But when they make that change people wanted, people get pissed anyway. You see what I mean?\n\nThey have nerfed Akali countless times as of this moment and planning another one for the next patch, which concludes that Riot does, in fact, listen. But people will again complain that she will be too strong regardless and will post about how Riot still did not listen. Because CT and people do not want to use brain power to figure out how to counter his champions other than gutting them, because it is definitely not easier to learn to play against them than to get them nerfed. It stupid Hasinsin logic, get Riot to nerf everything that kills you because you are never at fault.\n\nGoes 0/17/4 with a \"broken\" champion named Viktor, who is a counter champion to Riven.

That's where I got that from.\n\nI would wager that the people who ask for a change are not the ones getting pissed when that change happens. It is more likely another subset of individuals who were against that change in the first place, and as such, not complaining about it in the first place.\n\nThey have nerfed Akali exactly twice. Not \"countless times.\" Once in 8.18, which was a worthless change in the form of a small damage reduction to her ultimate. Then again in 8.22, a full SEVEN patches after her rework debuted in 8.15.\n\nI'm not even going to argue about CT. I can see both sides of the argument here. On one hand, there are surely ways to deal with his champions. On the other, they tend to be extremely toxic to play against, even when you have the proper circumstances to go against them. If you don't, then you're just straight up fucked.\n\nThe real problem, at least for me, is that Riot's philosophy is in direct contradiction with a lot of the playerbase, and a massive number of people have quit this game because of this. They even acknowledged that they understand damage is too high...but have done NOTHING about it. Sure, they sometimes will pay attention with individual champions, or items...but they don't seem to grasp the bigger picture here. That is a huge problem.

Neeko is beyond terrible in design. Zoe right now is at a balanced state, I have even proven it and debunked several posts against Zoe. Zoe or should I say, all of CT's champions, depends on the player putting time and effort into the kit. The funny thing is, Ryse is almost the same, but his W is point-click which sets his balancing off the road. Changing Ryze's W would make him so much easier to balance, else his kit is well designed.\n\nNeeko will be like Azir, too much to offer with minimal risk. Neeko will be doing burst with her Q, E, and Ultimate while being slippier than Zoe. Neeko also has an unfair amount of CC that is too strong for her already bursty kit. She has a strong wave clear with her Q, W, and E. Nothing about Neeko is well designed, or well thought out. She will go through the same treatment as Azir, Riot will be gutting her till she is pointless to use.\nI can, however, see a way out of this.\nTake off the burst damage from Neekos ultimate and E (her E should still do some damage, but not overwhelming.), and add it to her Q which will do more damage per tick. This will, justify her W and her, unreal amount of CC. \nNeeko is an unfinished product, I see what they want, but they can do so much better. And, I am confident that Neeko will take Akalis place as the most banned champion when she is released. Neeko is absurd, how some people think she is balanced is surprising to me.\n\n\nAkali is a fucking free win, why is she still a problem? The only thing needed is to increase her CD on her W and increase her execute damage.
