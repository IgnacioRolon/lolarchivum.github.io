(Janna Damage Buff)","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I&#039;m sorry, I don&#039;t want to be a pain. But just, why? What&#039;s the purpose? I can&#039;t see why this is even helpful for Janna, let alone reasonable. I&#039;m just telling you, that your &quot;balancing team&quot; has lost their mind. Are they seriously trying to make her mid lane viable? It could just be me, but I can&#039;t see her ever being played mid if that&#039;s the aim.\nTruth, be told. I don&#039;t care, I don&#039;t play anymore. But really, damage buff for Janna? If it how you keep the game interesting I will stay quiet.\n\n**Tailwind (Passive)** Bonus movement speed conversion to damage changed from [15/25/35% at levels 1/7/13] to [25/35% at levels 1/10]\n\nI didn&#039;t even want to write this but, come on, that&#039;s ridiculous. Out of everything so far, that&#039;s the most eye-rolling suggestion of a buff I have ever seen. I&#039;m just about calling the team a joke of all balancing in the gaming industry, at this point. If you don&#039;t mind, I will call them B team. Because they are far from being anything that could be certified as a, &quot;balancing team&quot;.\n\nDefinition of balancing:\n\n(It&#039;s just a joke, hopefully. There is no way they are mentally imbalanced.)\n5: mental and emotional steadiness\n\n(This is the definitions.)\n1a: to poise or arrange in or as if in balance\nbalancing a book on her head\nThe legislature hasn&#039;t balanced the budget in years.\nb: to bring into harmony or proportion\nI struggled to balance my career and family life.\na balanced diet\nc: to bring to a state or position of balance\nbalanced the scales by adding a little more on one side\n\nhttps://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/balance","replies":[{"poster":"im still toxic","date":"2018-09-22T04:14:14.903+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"With mobility boots that's like an extra 20 damage.
