Everyone has different views.)\n\nFirst off. Musicians like Beethoven and Mozart would singe in happiness. Her music is fantastic, beautiful, powerful, and illustrates her character extremely well. The music is well crafted, simple, but sounds complex. As a music creator and someone who studies a lot about music, I think this is your best peace by far, topping Quinn&#039;s fantastic login theme. I have heard a great deal of classical music, but this... this blew me away.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GC3XzERhxU\n\nAs for how she looks in-game. Nothing much to say, I&#039;m really happy the way she turned out. Ever since season 7 when I first tried her, she has been by far, one of my favorite champions underneath Quinn. However, I didn&#039;t play Irelia much. Her new abilities look smooth, well combined, and fitting for her lore.\nhttps://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/champion-reveal-irelia\n\nThe splash art, I believe you could do a little better. Looking at her art, I see a housewife with floating knives, not much of a warrior. Nightblade Irelia is more the style I would have taken, she looks beautiful but vicious, someone you do not want as your enemy. \nhttps://lolstatic-a.akamaihd.net/frontpage/apps/prod/rg-irelia-reveal/en_US/799921fe5991a64214c73a22b7df421f4230b6be/assets/downloads/wallpapers/irelia-1920x1080.jpg\nhttps://lolstatic-a.akamaihd.net/frontpage/apps/prod/rg-irelia-reveal/en_US/799921fe5991a64214c73a22b7df421f4230b6be/assets/downloads/wallpapers/nightblade-1920x1080.jpg\n\nSo what do you all think of the new Irelia?\n\nI think she gets a 9 out of 10 for in-game looks, a 7.5 out of 10 for her art, and a 10 out of 10 for her music.","replies":[]}
