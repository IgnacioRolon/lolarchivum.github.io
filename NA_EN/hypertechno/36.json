She is a niece champion, good in certain situations, but never really useful. Some will disagree, I understand, it might just be me who lost the skills to play her right. Yet, I cannot help feeling bad for the champion.\r\n\r\nI am not saying buff or rework her, I just wanted to talk about her. Let you all know that she exist in the game.\r\n\r\nThank you for reading.","replies":[]}
