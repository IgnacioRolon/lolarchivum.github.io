With little hesitation, she stood up and tried to scan where she was. Somehow, no one had seemed to notice her and her father&#039;s dead body with arrows sticking out of him. He was laying near the window in the room.\n&quot;How long have I been sleeping here?&quot;\n&quot;For about two days, it also seems like you took on a new hair, and clothing style as well,&quot; said a heavy voice, as he revealed himself.\n&quot;Caleb?!&quot;\n&quot;Yes, but not alive. I&#039;m only visible to you as a guardian spirit. I have followed you through our journey and helped you along the way.&quot;\n&quot;How?&quot;\n&quot;You know your feathery friend?&quot;\n&quot;Valor? Now that you mention it, where is he?&quot;\n&quot;It was me, Quinn, I was...&quot;\n&quot;Yes, I get that but where are you? Did you really die back there?&quot;\n&quot;Yes, and this guardian body, it&#039;s my short-term replacement. I&#039;m surprised I could stay for a day. But I can feel these are my last minutes, so I can only say goodbye now.&quot;\n&quot;You&#039;re lying. You&#039;re coming back as a different animal, I&#039;m sure. Right?&quot;\n&quot;As I said, this is my farewell. We, spirits, only get one more chance if we die. I choose my opportunity to help you, as Valor. This time, you will be alone.&quot;\nShe wasn&#039;t thrilled with the answer. She began breathing harshly, but she tried to keep her cool.\n&quot;It&#039;s not fair, but life has never been fair. I have lost everyone: you, mom, my step-father, and my real father. I have no place to go, I have no one to lean on, even Demacia will never accept me for what I am now. I have only myself...&quot;\n&quot;Quinn...&quot;\n&quot;But I will never, never again be beaten. I&#039;m the daughter of Swain and his dying wish I shall fulfill, by saving everyone. That was my promise.&quot;\nFootsteps could be heard outside the room. An army of Noxians was closing in.\n&quot;Quinn, run, get out of there.&quot;\n&quot;No, I am not running. Thanks to the story my dad told me, I have learned to use my magic.&quot;\nHowever, she was lying. She only knew the basic, but it was better to know something rather than nothing at all.\n\nThis story is connected to my Young Master Swain Skin Concept. That story wasn&#039;t looked over, so you will find some mistakes in Young Master Swains, Skin Lore.","replies":[{"poster":"Shmeeve","date":"2018-09-14T05:29:05.525+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No burd No buy","replies":[{"poster":"HyperTechno","date":"2018-09-14T14:10:29.435+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lord Apex,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=cM81Kvnd,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-09-14T05:29:05.525+0000)\n>\n> No burd No buy\n\nI know it was a long shot concept. Even calling the skin Mage Master was on the very bridge of confusion, since Quinn is a marksman, not a mage. The whole purpose is to inspire some wild ideas, for champions, such as giving a marksman a mage like skin. \nHer partner, Valor, would be hard to include into the skin, since, Quinn will be relying on magic. Again, it's just a concept, the likelihood of it happening is at a 0.01%. So don't worry.","replies":[]}]}]}
