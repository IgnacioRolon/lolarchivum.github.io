With a win rate of 55%, this should be a no-brainer to guess that this champion is broken right now and should be abused to get up in rank.\r\n\r\nI mean he has 110% MP scaling on his ult which also does max health damage for 4% on max with a (0.5% per 100 AP) that deals all that for 2 seconds. Not to mention it can suppress and has a knockdown. I mean Riot almost said, &quot;How can we make the most brain dead and most disable person use a champion.&quot; Not to be rude to anyone with a disability. \r\n\r\nHis Q has an 80% scaling that also silence, well is that fun. You take a ton of damage and being punished with a silence. That reminds me of an abusive mom spanking her child just because she had a bad day.\r\n\r\nOh my, here comes the bully, literally. He summons his small little weak friends to deal with you, but they are too weak to do anything to you. Poor little fellas, Voidligs you better than him, stop letting him control you like garbage.\r\n\r\nHis E, well is that not rude to the community with cancer, come on Riot. Not only does the description tell you it will make you see your endless painful demise, but also damage you. Wow, no better ability to define cancer with. And it also scales by 80%, damaging you for 4 seconds. If you get hit by this ability, just run and scream REEEEEEEEE, cause that Mal is coming to Q and Ult you. \r\n\r\nAnd then we have Fioras W in a passive, well is that not interesting. Pantheon gets a shield for every 3 ability but can be stunned. Yasuo gets a shield by walking but can be stunned. Then Mal has an auto working Fiora W, he cannot be stunned or CC&#039;ed like Fiora&quot;s W, but he also takes no damage from any source. It works like a Garen passive, but what does that matter when you can never ever get close enough to damage him the slightest. This ability is probably the strongest Passive I have seen in this game.\r\n\r\nI think I may just put my skills aside and play Mal until I hit Plat. This champion is so fucking stupid right now, oh wait, he always has been.\r\n\r\nBut if you want my opinion on the easiest champion to play and want to face roll and solo carry without a care. Then I really do think Mal takes the cake, he does so much damage, can zone like it was a walk in the park, and if he is behind, ha ha ha, come again kid he is going to come back like your angry abusive Mother.","replies":[]}
