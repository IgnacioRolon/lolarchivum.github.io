What I did differently; instead of adding a Passive Energy bar, I added an Active Energy bar. (Active Energy meaning collecting energy by fighting or with abilities that allows energy gain, but never out of combat.) However, I am no game designer so I cannot guarantee that this idea works. What may sound good on paper is not always good.\r\n\r\nBut as I see it, it would add a new set rule for characters like Zed, Akali, or whomever you want to name call. Simply put; you want to use your abilities, fight for them. \r\n\r\nI believe if Riot prioritized Active Energy over Passive Energy, we can see new classes of ideas for energy champions. Maybe some needed balance changes.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I will leave the idea to fly here. Take it or leave it.","replies":[{"poster":"Pxerkza","date":"2019-07-08T13:22:16.341+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"rengar?reksai?gnar?Rumble?Tryndamere?Vladimir?\nyes they are not called energy\nbut they are the exact same thing you describe","replies":[{"poster":"Saint Le√∏nidas","date":"2019-07-09T03:14:45.942+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Vladimir..?

I wouldn't mind if some characters who can already spam abilities had to manage a resource other than just health. Personally playing against trydamere is one of the more frustrating elements for me since when I'm out of Mana I have to leave lane all the while trynd can sit there with a tiamat and farm the wave eventually out leveling you. If he only gained rage from striking champions his heal sustain wouldn't be as strong and he would have to occasionally leave lane. Might be nice.","replies":[]}]}
