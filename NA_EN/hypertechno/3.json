Somehow and somewhere in Riot games, they think Zoe needed a nerf. Honestly, I didn&#039;t think it was going to hurt her, but, oh my, was I wrong. Keep your [removed by moderation] Zed, TF, and Talon up for months. With high pick rate and win rate. YEAH, Zoe unbalanced, Zoe OP. Why the fuck is Zed, TF, and Talon not nerfed yet then? They have had a consistent win rate, and pick rate. WTF is the difference with Zoe? &quot;She can one-shot.&quot; Sorry, Mr. I think I know it all. So can Zed, and Talon. Your point?\n\nThe worst part. Zoe, Zed, Talon, and TF had the same win rate and pick rates before she got nerfed. Else I could have cared less.\n\nZoe takes just as much skill as Zed, maybe more. Yeah, it&#039;s fucking annoying to get one shot by her, but it&#039;s the same God damn feeling you get when you get one-shot by Talon early, who is easier than Zoe, and Zed. With Zoe, you have to position constantly to hit Q&#039;s, and E&#039;s. With Zed and Talon, you don&#039;t have to cause their brain-dead &quot;skill shots&quot; can go through minions. \n\nIf Zoe needs a nerf so does Zed, Talon, and TF. Else you&#039;re biased. There is no way a champ with the same win rate, and pick rate as the other top tear champions are, broken.\n\nYou can&#039;t tell me, oh her win rate will go up when her pick rate falls. Sure, her win rate is still falling, with her pick rate. \n\nKarma, Azir, and Galio are the only champions she hits the hardest, three of them are out of meta and aren&#039;t viable picks right now. You can&#039;t make this up, the information is, right there, most mid champions win against Zoe. Hating her or not, she isn&#039;t overpowered. People are crying, for miss positioning themselves, and getting there ass blown apart from a Zoe combo one-shot, they deserved. You have to miss position extensively to get one-shot.\n\nStop crying, give her a mini buff, and stop touching her. I honestly, fucking hate Riot for even considering nerfing her. Good company, that listens to the wrong part, of the community. \n\nI&#039;m sorry if I offended any asshole out there, but your not the only person who should have fun. I as much deserve to have fun as everyone who plays this god damn game. The fact that Riot is making all the dumbest mistakes is because they listen to the wrong part of the community. Leauge isn&#039;t going to fail because of Riot, they are a great company, with the right mindset, it&#039;s going to fail because of its fucking community. They support virulent people, who play toxic champions. Who are those people? Honestly, I don&#039;t know. I could be one of them, but I know myself the best, and I know I want the best for League and it&#039;s community.\n\nI live by these Rules: &quot;First accept sadness. Realize that without losing, winning isn&#039;t so great.&quot;, &quot;An eye for an eye and the whole world goes blind.&quot; and &quot;Whoever is trying to bring you down, is already below you.&quot;\n\nA lot of people have already broken the third, from the beginning of her release.\n\nNo more to say, hope you have a great day.
