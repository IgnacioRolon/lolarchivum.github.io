Be nice, and respectful.\n\n* Reddie and the Board both have flaws: Anybody claiming one is better than the other should receive downvotes, no matter if they agree or not. They both do not belong in this conversation and does not solve the problem.\n\n* Do not be biased about your champion: I or anybody, may not discourage or degrade anybody who dislike our favorite champions.\n\n* Rank in this conversation should not matter: This post is here in everyone&#039;s opinion, rank should not matter; unless if it is not discouraging or degrading a champion, player, or Rioter. (Examples of Not: Yi is braindead. This player is Bronze. This Rioter is Bronze.)\n\n* Rioters, if you want a say: You must state your case with fair and respectful statements. I am not afraid, and I encourage others to call anything you say BS if anyone finds any good reason to do so and report it to the heads if you: 1) disrespect any player, 2) giving unprovable claims or statements, 3) not observe or empathize with players, 4) not supporting other peoples opinion without a reason. Else I will defend your comment no matter if you agree or disagree.\n\nMy argument:\n\nChampions are given random nerfs and buffs, for questionable reasons. There are numerous failures: 1) The ADC change became pointless; 2) Runes are either useless or overpowered, never buffed or nerfed reasonably; 3) there are only item order and no versatility, as the runes, useless or overpowered; 4) lag of empathy from the balancing team to the player; 5) not making a reasonable meta.","replies":[]}
