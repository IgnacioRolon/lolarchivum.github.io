But that is it, however, Riot bringing back AP Rengar back is quite stupid if I have to be real. I remember clearly how it was when AP Rengar was still a thing, it was dumb. Plz do not bring AP Rengar back, plz, give him his Q back, but not the AP.\r\n\r\nAlso, tune down on his damage a bit. After some games in the PBE, I think he does a little too much, his combo is not punished enough if he messes it up. He can take tanks down a little too easily, I will agree with being able to one-shot a squishy, but not one-shot a tank. \r\n\r\nI love him, but at the same time, I want others to be able to play the game without being completely butt fucked by Rengar.\r\n\r\nLet me make an example here:\r\nRengar can one-shot one to three people with the full AP build thanks to his W. While it takes one long Q from Zoe (Not including her E) to one-shot somebody, but she has to get it in range and dodge the minions.\r\n\r\nRengar can surprise or scare some people who have never played against a Rengar, making them an easy kill. While Zoe just pops up with a surprise E or Q (Lol, like it is a surprise Q anymore, the nerf on her literally made the Q too easy to dodge, you seriously need to be a monkey not dodge her Q).\r\n\r\nRengar also has a good escape ability (R). While Zoe ain&#039;t got time for that pussy play, she wanted a kit that does damage and has no escape tools, unless your enemy is stupid and gives her a free flash.","replies":[]}
