Again. 8th time, Riot.","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Ok, either remover the shit entirely or fix it, so it can understand if it's an accidental leave or not. This has gotten out of hand, this is the 8th time, I have gotten a Leaver Buster punishment, for shit I cannot control. I can't control if YOUR server has a connection problem, nor can I control YOUR client. I want my 19 LP back, from YOUR server, that can't connect me. This has gotten uprightly tiring, the Leaver Buster can't seem to get the difference between an unwanted AFK and a wanted AFK. I also do not know how many times I have to write to your poor support team. They have to deal with me writing to them about the issue, even showing them the evidence every time.\r\n \r\nSecondly, why do people who actually, quit with no excuse, get no Leaver Buster? I tested this out on my secondary account, and I got no punishment even after 5 leaves. Like, WTF Riot.\r\n\r\nSeriously, I have been patient with Riot, this is, the last straw for me. On the 7th one, I thought they got the hint, and I stayed quiet. But now that it's not, just me, but several people. I think I need to change the tone a bit.\r\n\r\nI want Riot, no, demand a change in the system. So it can punish people that deserve it, and not the unfortunate people who got kicked out of the game because they couldn't connect for some reason. \r\n\r\nIt's either that or nothing.  If you think it's justice, to punish people who have nothing to do with it, who didn't want to be disconnected, or have a bug, and hurt the team. If you think it's fair to let toxic people who do disconnect to either troll or rage quit, who wants to do harm to the team. Then why make it a team game, if you don't support a team-oriented game, what's the point.\r\n\r\nI also know for a fact that it isn't my computer or my internet, they have been able to play since season 6 till now with no problem, until season 8 started. So the fact that I'm getting problems now, is beyond me.","replies":[{"poster":"Ragnaveil","date":"2018-06-16T03:23:26.478+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Leaverbuster is a SYSTEM, not a PERSON.

Firstly, really sorry you had to deal with a player like that, I'll look into it and make sure they're appropriately actioned on. As for your penalty, the LeaverBuster system targets players who have a tendency of leaving or AFKing in games, whether it was intentional or not. Because of that we will typically not lighten a leaverbuster punishment on an account. Keep in mind, a leaver or AFKer can have dramatic impact on the game; even leaving for a short duration and coming back to complete the game results in a period where a team has to play 4v5.\n\nSince you brought up your connection issues, I'll go ahead and transfer you to our Tech team so they can try to troubleshoot it with you. Would definitely not want you to get placed in LPQ again due to something out of your control :(\n\n♯1 Fuzzy Pilot\nRiot Games Player Support\n\n\nLUDUSBONUS\nMay 12th 2018, 1:47:18 pm\nHey there HyperTechno,\n\nI am LudusBonus from Riot Technical Player Support, and I'll be jumping on this issue for you!\n\nGetting a leaver buster on top of a technical issue indeed sucks. However, leaver buster only applies after it notices a pattern of leaves on your account :/ Even though those leaves weren't on purpose, they still effected alot of team members every game and forced them to play a 4v5 or matchmake again. Realize the leaver buster is there to help you realize that your actions, even if unintentional, are negatively effecting other players. Let's focus on your technical issue and I can take a look at your LB after we fix it (If I removed it now and your tech issue came up again, you'd just get another LB that I couldn't remove).\n\nI know this seems out of your control and like a client bug, if you're getting bugsplats that is generally a sign of file corruption, third party program, or bad drivers. We'll need to find which one and fix it so this stops happening :)\n\nKeep in mind, as you try these steps, I recommend you only try to duplicate the error in custom games. This way you will not affect other player's games.\n\n1) It is common for other programs to interfere with League of Legends connections. To eliminate the possibility of that happening, let's turn off your unnecessary start up processes. This has the added benefit of making your PC boot up faster :)\n\nGo to your start menu and type in the search area, \"Command Prompt\"\nOpen Command Prompt and type msconfig and then hit enter\nA window shall open, select Selective Startup and uncheck Load Startup items.\nClick Apply, OK and then restart your PC.\n2) Do a repair of your client. Click the gear in the top right of your client after logging in. Then select 'Initiate Full Repair'. This should fix weird bugs or corrupted/missing files.\n\nIf your issue persists, I would like you to gather some logs for me to look at. Please download and install our hextech repair tool. When you download it, make sure to run it as admin. You can go ahead and run it with default settings and click start. When it finishes, please send me the lol logszip the hextech repair tool puts on your desktop so I can dig deeper into your issue. I look forward to being able to help you more!\n\nLudusBonus\nJax Main\nRiot Games Player Support\n\n\nHYPERTECHNO\nMay 12th 2018, 6:21:40 pm\nOk, thank you. I understand the terms. \nI haven't played a game yet, but I will still send you the Zip, just, in case. Plz, do notify me of anything that could be affecting my game, so I can find a way to prevent it.\n\nI want to be the most sport-like player in League. So I want to do everything I can to stay in the game, even if it means I have to play with a bad teammate. The last one was my fault, and I should have kept my cool and reported him after the game.\n\nTy, very much, \nHyperTechno\n\n\nLoL Logs.zip (1423555 Bytes)\nLUDUSBONUS\nMay 12th 2018, 6:39:15 pm\nThanks for those logs, I didn't realize you were on a mac :P I am glad you're so devoted to becoming a better sportsman in game :) Its not always easy but it takes persistence. For making sure your tech issue doesn't happen again, here is what I suggest:\n\n1) Run a SOFTWARE UPDATE as League is designed to run on the latest OS versions. This fixes many bugs for Macs. Also, ensure League of Legends has correct PERMISSIONS as League may not be able to run properly without this.\n\n2) Switching to public DNS servers may resolve the issue you are experiencing: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664#mq4 & making sure to flush it\n\n3) Let's try an uninstall and then reinstall. Follow this link for instructions on how to do so on a mac: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202539040#section-mac\n\nIf your issue persists, please send me updated HRT logs so I can continue to investigate the issue.\n\nLudusBonus\nJax Main\nRiot Games Player Support\n\n\nHYPERTECHNO\nMay 13th 2018, 12:12:05 pm\nOk, the client is working well again. However, I now have an in-game problem. My game starts lagging out of control at times, and I don't know why. I can't see my FPS or Ping. \nThis has never been a problem in the past, I have a good internet connection, and my computer can normally handle the game. \nSo the game starting to constantly lag at random is quite annoying. \nIf you have any tips on how I can fix it, plz, tell me.\n\n\nCORNDOG\nMay 14th 2018, 1:09:02 pm\nHowdy HyperTechno,\n\nCorndog here to serve up some fresh answers on the situation, and I'll reply for LudusBonus.\n\nRunning into spots of lag would be a big ol' feelsbad and it sucks to hear it's been causing you problems while playing D:\n\nIf you can't see your FPS or ping when this happens, it's possible you've either disabled the counter option, or there could be a corrupt game setting file preventing it from coming up. I also have a few tricks for testing your routing path to the NA server, which I'd like to see if that will tell us where these lag spikes are you coming from:\n\nHeads up: You will want to test the changes we make in Custom games only!\n\n1) I'd like you unplug your router/modem from it's power source for 30 seconds before plugging it back in.\n\n2) I'd like to run a test from where you live, to the NA server, and to do so I would like you to use a program called Ping Plotter. After you've downloaded this program, please enter the following IP Addresses (one at a time) of the server you primarily use and on the right side of the Ping Plotter, set your test parameters to a 1 Second Trace Interval and a 5 Minute Focus Time.\n\nNA Test Addresses: 192.64.170.252 and 104.160.131.1\n\nOnce the target field and the parameters are properly filled out, press the Play button on the left side to start the traceroute.\nOnly after the test runs for the allotted 5 minutes, please take a screenshot of the results in their entirety.\nRepeat the above steps for the 2nd IP Address on your respective server.\nAfter you are done, please attach both screenshots in your next reply, along with your LoL Logs, Network Analysis, and a System Report.\n\nCorndog\nRiot Games Player Support\nThresh Main\n\n\nHYPERTECHNO\nMay 14th 2018, 4:54:44 pm\nI could take the screenshots, but the Repair Tool didn't want to analyze and got stuck. I have none of the old versions. Except for the one I gave LudusBonus if it can help, else I will try again. \nWith the NA and SP, can you live with out? It will take me days to find the SR, and my computer will bug me about the Network Analysis.\n\nTell me, if you need anything though.\n\n\nScreen Shot 2018-05-14 at 3.56.59 PM.png (122405 Bytes)\nScreen Shot 2018-05-14 at 4.06.25 PM.png (144898 Bytes)\nScreen Shot 2018-05-14 at 4.05.19 PM.png (138243 Bytes)\nCORNDOG\nMay 14th 2018, 8:22:06 pm\nThank you for the test results, and don't worry about the HRT not wanting to work. These tests tell me all I need to know at the moment.\n\nFrom what it looks like, there is something going on between Texas and Chicago, as your connection path seems to do just fine until it hits a certain spot. Past that spot, there are ping spikes between 800 - 2300+ which would make for a highly unstable situation. I have a few other suggestions we could try out to help with this, but there might be a problem with the ISP to cause this:\n\n1) Look up the model of your router/modem on the manufacturer's website and see if you can find the \"reset\" button on it. It is likely small, and will require you to press it with a pen or the end of a paperclip. Hold the reset button down for 10 seconds to flush the device's settings back to default. This may clear out a bad setting that is causing the issue to happen.\n\n2) If that doesn't help, you may need to call your ISP and ask them to check your connection from their end. I would request a spare router/modem to test if your problem suddenly clears up with replacing your current model, as there may be something wrong with it. If nothing else, I would ask to email a Level 2 Technician your Winmtr test results and see what they think about them.\n\n3) You can try the following VPN services and see if they work as a temporary fix while a permanen","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-06-16T04:18:38.253+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So they told you what the problem is, and it is neither your system or theirs.\n\nWhy are you then bitching about the client when it is a third party network issue?","replies":[{"poster":"HyperTechno","date":"2018-06-16T04:35:16.348+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MagicFlyingLlama,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=oF1APipF,comment-id=0000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2018-06-16T04:18:38.253+0000)\n>\n> So they told you what the problem is, and it is neither your system or theirs.\n> \n> Why are you then bitching about the client when it is a third party network issue?\n\nOk, let me tell you what I'm 100% after. It does its job, but not in the way they tell you how it should work. After the 5th intentional leave, on my secondary account, I still didn't get an LB. When I clearly should have. \n\nIt took only three failing attempts on my connection on my regular account, to get an LB.\n\nIt's about fairness. People who did nothing wrong, get punished harder than the one who intentionally leaves. That isn't fair for anyone, especially for the one who can't do anything about it. I want justice to be served against the people who rightfully deserve it. \n\nThe LB shouldn't stop being given to me, because I have a bug or a connection failure, it should be nicer, towards the people who couldn't do carp about it.
