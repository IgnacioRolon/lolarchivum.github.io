Maple Nectar here, Producer on the Live Team (aka Balance team).\r\n\r\nIT&rsquo;S HAPPENING!!! As you&rsquo;ve almost certainly noticed, Runes Reforged is finally here! I can&rsquo;t even begin to express how fun and exciting it is to get to be a part of the journey as we usher in the largest gameplay update to League ever! We&rsquo;re super stoked to see how the new system changes how you look at the game, how they impact the decisions you make, and how your path to victory is forged with the new runes. They&#039;ve been live for 2 full days now (1 if you&rsquo;re not from OCE), and we&#039;re starting to get a clearer picture of what the &ldquo;balance&rdquo; landscape looks like in this new world. We&rsquo;re seeing tons of experimentation (Klepto support GP, Glacial Augment Jhin) which we&rsquo;re super happy to see, as those creative decisions are something we were really hoping to get out of Runes. With that in mind, I&#039;d like to take a moment to briefly discuss how we&#039;ll be approaching balance in the next few days/weeks in this post, and make sure everyone get an idea of what at a high level we&#039;re going to try to accomplish over the course of pre-season. This is likely the first of a number of posts over the next while \r\n\r\nFirstly, our goal is not going to be &ldquo;get every champion to 50% winrate as fast as possible&rdquo;. That wasn&#039;t our goal before pre-season, and that doesn&rsquo;t change with everything out in the wild now. With Runes we expect to see a lot more creative decision making than before, choices that vary based on the champion you&rsquo;re taking, your team comp, and who you&rsquo;re facing. There&rsquo;s sure to end up being some level of optimization between champions and the new runes system, but when a player gets creative and comes up with a really smart combination of champion and runes, we expect them to also be rewarded with a greater chance to succeed. That being said, there are always edge cases, and if we see something that warps gameplay in a way we&rsquo;re not happy with we&rsquo;ll step in and intervene even if winrates look within reason. We&#039;re also likely to step in if it appears that some champions are struggling to find success in the new system, as we want you to be able to take any champion, make cool choices, and have a chance to win.\r\n\r\nWe&rsquo;re starting to get an idea of how things are shaking out, though for a change so huge it&rsquo;s going to take quite some time until dust settles and we have a clear picture of how everything looks both as individual pieces, and in the larger picture. We&#039;re going to try to solve the right issue, so if we see a champion succeeding disproportionately with a specific set of Runes compared to other champions in it&rsquo;s class, we&rsquo;re likely to take a good hard look at that individual champion and the things that changed around it (base stats, keystones etc). If an entire class moves disproportionately, that&rsquo;s a signal of systemic changes being the culprit, so we&rsquo;ll look to solve that as opposed to changing each individual champion. We don&rsquo;t want to make the mistake of over correcting anything (champions/runes/items etc), since preseason is supposed to be a time of experimentation and creative decision making, but you can expect us to start acting proactively on things we&rsquo;re not quite comfortable with. Tomorrow we&rsquo;re likely to start talking about what we intend to micropatch and work on before Patch 7.23 lands.\r\n\r\nWe&#039;re super pumped to see the crazy shit you&rsquo;re trying, so keep it coming and [Preseason responsibly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FUrZX54jw8).","replies":[{"poster":"Risk of Fate","date":"2017-11-09T23:32:22.677+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":6,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Riot MapleNectar","date":"2017-11-09T23:37:20.601+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"We're likely to need to make different systemic changes to allow non adcs to function in the botlane alongside a support.

In theory, it's to help us bodyblock for teammates, yes? But in practice, being bigger causes me to eat unnecessary damage and CC more often than it gives me that extra size needed to take a Nidalee spear for an ally.

For example: Miss Fortune can rush Duskblade and if you make it to get an empowered Q on the enemies they are like from 100% to 20% (i'm serious i'm playing her myself and that is way too much damage). Same thing goes with all AD-Junglers. Kha'Zix, Rengar, Hecarim, Jarvan, Kayn and many more. I was actually extremely confused when i saw that you buffed Duskblade at the start of the new rune system. \n\nLong story short: New rune system = awesome!!! Duskblade = super duper mega MEH!!!","replies":[]},{"poster":"HaytG","date":"2017-11-21T10:11:45.253+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You definitely have to do something with system of earning BE, getting one champion from Capsule at 16 lvl which you can disenchant for 210BE is a joke, and in very bad taste. Removing way to earn PZ (now BE) from every played game was a terrible idea. In my opinion you shouldn’t have removed it, as you did it you should have for example decreased cost of every champion for at least 25% up to 50% or disenchanting champion shard should give you 100% of champion cost.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RRektK","date":"2017-11-20T13:08:19.636+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi!\n\n Why u guys dont let us do infinity rune pages, some of the champs need other keystone runes, but cant cause slots are full, with mastery pages in season 7 i had 20 mastery pages.. you guys should increase that. :D\n\nThank you for your time!","replies":[]},{"poster":"lućas","date":"2017-11-10T20:01:18.803+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Draven is quite horrid with Press the Attack and the precision tree, but with sorcery and summon aery he is very good.

As a  6 year LoL player, I really like this approach you all are taking. The advantages of certain combinations isn't just spelled out for everyone to see...it's possible to specifically tailor runes to fit your playstyle (whether that playstyle varies based on champ or versus a certain champ). I know there will be adjustment along the way, but i'm dialed in. I know you all are receiving a ton of hate for these changes, but most of it is a LARGE overreaction.

Outside of the keystones, your decisions don’t seem particularly impactful, nor do they seem particularly diverse.\n\nAs an example, other than the one rune in sorcery, I see no runes that offer temporary shields outside of Guardian, which is honestly made for supports. While I get that shield stacking was a problem last season, having active survivability tools in the top lane in runes might help make full tank picks more appealing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yordleassault","date":"2017-11-12T20:09:20.837+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah, I'd also love to experiment around with runes... shame it feels impossible and discouraged :(\nI only have 2 rune pages and already had to squeeze 3 playstyles into them. With the mastery system I could get away with buying 0 pages cause they were only stats and the mastery pages were free. Now, I'll have to grind half a year and spend exclusively on rune pages in that time to make the system comfortable (at least 1 page for each playstyle/favorite champ) and THEN I will be able to start actual experimentation... Shame, I was so hyped and I still feel hyped for the possibility, but my enthusiasm is just killed off completely as I feel like I'm forced to grind exclusively with the 3 playstyles (2 champions) that I was able to fit into my 2 rune pages, and avoid playing with anyone else (as they can't yet have their proper rune pages)...\nFeels bad, man{{sticker:cass-cry}}","replies":[]}]}
