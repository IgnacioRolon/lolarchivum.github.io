{"poster":"Riot MapleNectar","date":"2017-10-02T20:40:00.640+0000","title":"General Philosophy on Balance Hotfixing","subforum":"Dev Corner","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey folks!\n\nAs you&rsquo;ve likely seen, we pushed out a second balance hotfix for Janna at the end of last week, and saw that it caused some confusion with players (rightfully so) and I wanted to jump in and provide some context! Earlier this year we got some fancy dancy new tech (&ldquo;micropatching&rdquo;) which allows us to create a change (bug fix, balance change etc), bundle them up, and ship them within the very short time frame of an hour or two depending on the changes in question. This was a huge improvement over how that process used to work, but we never really talked about that, so I&rsquo;ll take a second to run through that as well.\n\nIn the past, changing the live environment for something like a balance hotfix was quite time intensive. We&#039;d first make the change, which then required a sweep of testing from QA for several hours to a day, and then members of our release team would take up to a day to ship it out to all of our severs around the world. It was a super unwieldy process and hampered our ability to react to things as quickly as we would like. It also incurred more risk as shipping a change meant we needed to be 100% confident it wouldn&rsquo;t break anything, since we couldn&rsquo;t just &ldquo;roll it back&rdquo; without another run-through of the process mentioned above. This also meant that we couldn&#039;t do these on Friday, since breaking a champion/item on the weekend meant we&#039;d have to leave them disabled until Monday, which was something we ALWAYS strive to avoid. Micropatching lets us bypass all that and get changes to you in a fraction of the time, with a fraction of the risk.\n\nOne thing we have to remember though is:\n\n[With great power comes great responsibility](http://i0.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/facebook/000/017/572/uncleben.jpg) (man this meme is weaker when image embedding doesn't work)\n\nBalance hotfixing is incredibly powerful, but it&rsquo;s also dangerous. Hotfix too much and it looks like we don&rsquo;t have our shit together, hotfix too little (when it&rsquo;s necessary), and players may have to deal with a shitty situation longer than they&rsquo;re happy with. When it comes to newly released content, be it a new champion, new item, or an update, our stance is that we&rsquo;re going to be more than happy to pull the hotfix trigger if we feel the situation necessitates it. When their power ends up being stronger/weaker than we&rsquo;re happy with, we believe it&rsquo;s overall better to quickly hotfix out some numbers changes before everyone settles into the update, versus waiting two weeks and then making everyone do more re-learning in the next full patch.\nI&rsquo;ll use the changes we made to Janna last week as an example since they&#039;re recent, though we&rsquo;ve applied this thinking to smaller updates like what we did with Singed as well:\n\n[(Screenshot from Wednesday morning after patch 7.19&rsquo;s release)](http://i.imgur.com/vw0YGcI.png)\n\nIn the chart above, the green bar indicates that Janna&rsquo;s WR had increased 2.7% from the patch before, up to a total of 58.8% as shown with the red bar. We&rsquo;d had some inclination that she would release strong and would require follow up some suspicion on as alluded to in the patch notes, (and even talked  about it a bit [here](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/pt/c/developer-corner/gikJEw03-janna-hotfix-context), so we decided to react quickly and get our first change out in the wild before her power would continue to sway the results of the games she was in. We underestimated how quickly Janna players would adapt to the more aggro playstyle, and overestimated how quickly players would figure out how to play around Janna in the lane phase. This is borne out in her initial performance stats, which were on the high side, so we reacted.\n\n[(Screenshot from Thursday morning after our first hotfix)](http://i.imgur.com/4xdbMSc.png)\n\n\nThe numbers above show that our hotfix from Wednesday brought Janna slightly back down to earth, with the red bar indicating that Janna&rsquo;s win-rate at all MMR (56.4%), and High MMR (56.1%). The smaller numbers on the left&mdash;0.3%, and 0.0%&mdash;represent the change in her winrate from the patch before. Note that our the driver for these types of changes are almost NEVER based on WR alone, but in the early stages of a new release more nuanced things like frustration, counterplay and abuse cases are far harder to pinpoint with certainty, so WR is often the only concrete thing we have to go off of.\n\nGetting back to Janna, we knew that Wednesday&rsquo;s changes were getting back on the right track based on the data represented above. At this point, with her performance back in line with 7.18 levels (which was also certainly on the high side), we could have left followup until the 7.20 patch given that, in 7.18, that same WR wasn&rsquo;t something we were considering hotfixing Janna for. That&rsquo;s where the previously-mentioned efficiency of micropatching comes into play.\n\nWe had just worked on Janna, players were clearly figuring her out but weren&rsquo;t &ldquo;used&rdquo; to her new changes, and she was still stronger than we wanted long term. Rather than wait for next patch we chose to respond a second time since we could with relative ease and it felt like the correct thing to do. Fast forward to today and Janna is sitting at around 53.8% at both High and all MMR which is getitng much closer to what we would expect from her. We&rsquo;ve been testing some additional changes to her on the PBE which could end up shipping in few patches, but current thinking is that we may just wait until after Runes Reforged ships to give us the time to see where everyone lands. It&#039;s going to be a hot mess for a little bit which is honestly really exciting, but it makes any attempt to fine tune a champion in the next few patches rather temporal. That doesn&#039;t mean we won&#039;t, just that there&#039;s likely to be fewer changes\n\nBUT ANYWAYS! I want to be clear that this isn&rsquo;t a post about Janna, she was just a good current case study to illustrate our philosophy around hotfixes and why we are likely to pursue them with the same rigor in the future. We won&#039;t go out of our way to find candidates that need this attention, but if we miss the mark we&#039;ll respond quickly. We&#039;re also working on finding some better ways of communicating that they&#039;re happening/happened. Things like using the esports ticker that informs you of an ongoing match, or even a notification in champ select to name a few options. More on that to come.\n\nI&#039;ll try to kick around in the comments to answer a few questions, but let me know what you think of this approach!","replies":[{"poster":" Jar Jar binks l","date":"2017-10-02T21:12:37.997+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":4,"body":"Maybe u can finally hotfix Ardent Censer.

Things like the Dev corner, an increase of technical discussion in patch notes (\"we think this champ does x too\" well instead of \"this champ is too strong so we made them weaker\"), and more detailed previews of big upcoming changes like the rune rework all go miles to understanding what's going on behind the curtain, and it's wonderful. I don't think everyone has been around long enough to understand how much of an improvement it is.\n\nOne thing that would be awesome would be to have a 1-page running tally of all current and upcoming balance changes _as they currently stand_. Things that would go there would be PBE changes (maybe even with context!), upcoming patch possibilities, Dev blog announcements, hotfixes, and other changes that might otherwise fall under the radar.\n\nRight now while the Dev blog does a great job of showing us the process, the current status of any given change is entirely up in the air unless you can corner a rioter - which could happen in game, on the boards, on Reddit, on Twitter...things like \"Press the Attack\" being changed to also offer AP are a huge deal to players like me, but can easily slip under the cracks if you don't have PBE access.\n\nAnd yeah, I know all these changes are very tentative and won't necessarily last, but it's still nice to get a sense of where things are as they develop. Just a single feed with like \"PBE, PBE Upcoming, Future Ideas, Hotfixes, etc...\" Would be awesome.\n\n\nJust something I've been thinking about recently.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot MapleNectar","date":"2017-10-03T01:05:01.284+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> One thing that would be awesome would be to have a 1-page running tally of all current and upcoming balance changes as they currently stand.

Not sure about an active running list with all current changes, but we're considering things like throwing up a post on the dev corner at the start of one of our patches with the things we're going to be working on with rough context for them.

Micropatching tends to have a far lesser risk than traditional hotfixing (redeploys) because it only requires that we ship the individual change in isolation rather than the entirety of the code to include one small change. It also tends to be a different type of change that incurs far less risk. I'll elaborate a bit more about what a micropatch actually is.\n\nPretend that all of our assets (champs, items, monsters, minions, etc), are bundled together into a big stack, this is what makes up a game version which is what we ultimately ship to players. In the redeploy approach (which we still have to do with some of our more complex code fixes), we'd have to make a change to one of those pieces of content, and then reship the entire bundle out to players so that the hotfix could be applied. For Micropatching, we're able to treat a balance change/some bug fixes as a unique layer that sits on top of the specific piece of content it's addressing. In Janna's case, we made changes to her base stats and shipped that as Janna 2.0, and then made the changes to her shield values and passive damage scaling as Janna 3.0. Those are called layers, in that they essentially lay on top of whatever the Janna 1.0 in the stack was. When you boot up a game and there's a Janna select, the client then looks at the game server and asks \"k gimme the Janna stuff\" and the server sends whatever the most recent version of the champion is. \n\nMicropatches tend to be simpler fixes like hp numbers, damage, cd etc - these are called .json values and are quite easy to swap in and out. There's also some scripting stuff we're able to handle like the Janna passive work we did in the second micropatch.\n\nRedeploys tend to be used for more complex bug fixes that actually require a code change to resolve. Things like the Jax bug that's causing disconnects, that will repaired via a redeploy vs a micropatch since it's far riskier, requires far more testing, and touches way more things in the game.\n\nThat ended up being a pretty detailed response, let me know if that answered your question!","replies":[{"poster":"TheFoxLord","date":"2017-10-03T06:41:16.116+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Based on that, does that mean that this \"Janna 3.0\" will get reset to \"Janna 1.0\" at the start of the next full patch?

This is exemplified most often with new champions; they generally start at a notably low win rate and climb as players master them. That would be one reason we may be resist to immediate buffs. Additionally, for power deficiencies, often the best changes on the outset are \"quality of life\" feeling mechanical adjustments that become apparent after lots of players dig into a new champ or change. Unfortunately these changes end up not being the best hotfix candidates.

Balance is also their job.","replies":[{"poster":"Chromatic Eagle","date":"2017-10-03T20:08:18.507+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I mean, some releases are better than others, but mistakes do happen.

Because some aspects of this post kind of confused me. For example: \n\n> Getting back to Janna, we knew that Wednesday’s changes were getting back on the right track based on the data represented above. At this point, with her performance back in line with 7.18 levels (which was also certainly on the high side), we could have left followup until the 7.20 patch given that, in 7.18, that same WR wasn’t something we were considering hotfixing Janna for.\n\nIf the champions I played had a 56.4% winrate, they would be nerfed within the hour that the patch went live. I'm not exaggerating. I understand that there are more factors to balancing a champion than win rate, but 56%+ is such an egregious outlier that it seems totally bizarre to me that you guys would even consider leaving her in that state, even in the previous 6 patches where she had that winrate. Ultimately, I suppose you didn't choose to do that, so maybe I'm overreacting, but it's kind of frustrating to hear that.","replies":[{"poster":"Hekaladi","date":"2017-10-03T06:35:45.513+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think that they use a statistical mindset to do that, like a gaussian curve with standard deviations. For example, that 52% could be + 1 SD, 54% + 2 SD, 48% - 1 SD etc. From my experience, normally is usually \"defined\" in range of (- 2 , + 2) (95% confidence interval) or (- 3, + 3) (99% CI). Balance team have some good reason to keep Janna on high rates even for mid or long term: mainly she cant snowball games like ap mages or assassins; she has a moderate to high learn curve (even higher after minirework); she deals one of lowest dps in game, etc. Like a main Janna (in G5 ELO), I have constant 65 - 70% win rate with her (around some hundred matches) and I think that her new tools are hideous powerful in hands of expert with the expense of early game (laning most of time). However, she was always a scaling support who shines in protecting a carry in mid/late game, after rework that aspect got more proeminent and this is a healty thing overall.","replies":[]}]}]}
