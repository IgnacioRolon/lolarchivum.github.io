The fuck? Calling someone a noob is bannable? Honestly, at this point I'm done with these adults who are so overly sensitive at everything you say to them. This game is not worth the time and effort if  I can't  even havea  little fun with harmless words. Why would anybody online get offended for being called a noob? Or if he's  told \"Fuck you\"? Banning for toxicity should not be a thing.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Summoner SpeII","date":"2020-01-14T01:28:13.629+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"don't type anything negative, not even a tiny bit, don't ask for reports, don't say u will mute others, shorten curse words, proceed to get honor 5 profit?","replies":[{"poster":"Modi","date":"2020-01-14T01:58:17.087+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Summoner SpeII,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=035l8sIc,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2020-01-14T01:28:13.629+0000)\n>\n> don't type anything negative, not even a tiny bit, don't ask for reports, don't say u will mute others, shorten curse words, proceed to get honor 5 profit?\n\nYou can use swear words all you want, as long as they are not 1) a zero-tolerance word or 2) directed at someone.
