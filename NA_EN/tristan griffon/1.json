My account is level 7, but it says it's level 6 on here, preventing me from posting in most threads.\r\n\r\nAnd problem 2 is the big one. A few games I've tried to join now have bugged out when I click \"Accept\". The client thinks I hit declined, and everyone is put back in the queue. I actually got a warning that I will be punished for it if it kept happening, which has made me afraid to even play Co-op Vs. AI at this point!\r\n\r\nI'm hoping there's some solutions to these two problems. I don't much mind the former one, although it IS annoying, but the second one is kinda a deal breaker, isn't it? x.x","replies":[{"poster":"Tristan Griffon","date":"2017-05-20T07:03:35.170+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hm... Well, looking/thinking on it... Our internet speed, even when we HAVE data, seems to want to sit on 600 ms, ping-wise. Since we live a bit out of typical service range, but not so far that they can't give service. Without the data, though, my ping fluctuates from between 600, to 1000, and occasionally skyrockets to 2000 or, once when I was in a game, 5000!\n\nIt might have done that when the ping skyrocketed...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-20T04:19:58.139+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like a man that doesn't waste his time! \n\nSometimes those boards levels have a couple issues getting synced up with your Summoner level. Once you posted here it forced them to sync up and you're showing as level 7 for me now!\n\nAs for that weird queue malfunction, it almost sounds like when you click accept that data is never sent to our servers so the click never actually goes through. I want to make sure we cover all of our bases, so let's make sure to check up on some of your [**network settings**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) really quickly.
