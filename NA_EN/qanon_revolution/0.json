They'll be able to take a look at your account and make any adjustments - in this case, it looks like granting the Rising Dawn ward.\n\n**EDIT:** Looks like the ward was granted, and it is in your store inventory. Would you mind taking another look and letting me know if it's there? Thanks! :D \n\nAlso, 0 amount in the store purchase history is how all items from Hextech Crafting look until store fixes it. (So this is a bug on its own.)","replies":[]}]}
