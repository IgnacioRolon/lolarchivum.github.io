I apologize for not having any concrete proof or example but I suck at computer stuff.  All game i was able to devour my teamates except my caitlin.  I was unable to target caitlin with devour the entire game I would just click around her and walk to her instead.  I could devour enemies, minions, and the other members of my team.  Idk if that was a bug or if Im just bad.  Has anyone else seen this before?","replies":[]}
