I haven't received anything as much as a warning but I haven't gotten hextech loot in about 4 games of S+ rank.","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-03-26T00:14:22.813+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you haven't received any punishments and aren't receiving chests, it's probably because you already earned a chest for that champion.

For players that are punished by the Instant Feedback system and work off the punishment, they will still be restricted from earning Hextech chests or keys for a period while the system ensures that they have reformed their behavior. **There is no fixed interval here** - if you continue to play with sportsmanlike behavior, you'll eventually get back into good standing. We're looking into making a player's status more clear/visible to help avoid this kind of confusion.\n\nNo fixed interval but not forever either.","replies":[]}]}
