So you'll get keys for just playing games. As it pertains to punishments (say you just got off a 14-day ban) I don't think it resets that your punishment account standings, but it didn't say anything about that.","replies":[{"poster":"Laughs in Binary","date":"2017-06-28T22:03:25.013+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, that's why I made this discussion to see if any Rioters or well-informed people could tell me. But if I'm being fair, (maybe Riot didn't intend this) the people that did really well with the old honor system receive no benefit so maybe those that did below average with the old honor system will receive a clean slate as well. That does contradict itself though because that would mean chat-restrictions and temporary bans would be lifted if this is a clean slate idea.","replies":[{"poster":"DuckCurry","date":"2017-07-11T15:57:54.926+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"People will still need to ride out any existing punishments, but from a honor rewards eligibility perspective you'll have a fresh start.\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[{"poster":"SirTeemoMushroom","date":"2017-09-26T12:17:23.617+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"what do you mean? if you get banned but you are honor 5 .. you wont get  perm banned? you will just get chat  ban??","replies":[{"poster":"DuckCurry","date":"2017-12-01T16:06:42.644+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SirTeemoMushroom,realm=EUNE,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=hjTaYlBK,comment-id=0001000000000000,timestamp=2017-09-26T12:17:23.617+0000)\n>\n> what do you mean? if you get banned but you are honor 5 .. you wont get  perm banned? you will just get chat  ban??\n\nThat response was only regarding what happens when Honor launches for the very first time where someone had a suspension or chat restriction beforehand.
