Afterwards I've won 3 games straight giving me +13 +12 and +13. Then my first loss was -22 I don't understand.\nIs there a reason why the LP gains are so low? I'm playing against all people who are the same rank if not higher.\nI'm just concerned if this is a bug and I should stop playing for now or if this is the case for everyone thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-08T17:35:12.070+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"LP adjustments haven't changed, so the information in the [matchmaking guide](http://matchm) still applies.

I've been playing since season 3 and I've never had garbage LP gains and losses like this after a new season started. I am 11-3  ranked and I just lost 19 LP while my previous match, a win, was +16 LP.\n\nThe best part about the ranked season is the very beginning when we all have awesome LP gains for awhile and can climb well. This feel's like an absolute slap in the face.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Its Yuu and Mi","date":"2016-12-08T20:38:17.788+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Porocles,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=YUGXM5j1,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-12-08T17:35:12.070+0000)\n>\n> LP adjustments haven&#x27;t changed, so the information in the [matchmaking guide](http://matchm) still applies.

It's faster to fall to where the system wants you and to climb back out than it is to tread water doing what you're doing. As far as I can tell from my own experience, if the system wants you to go lower, it will force you there long before it moves your MMR to match your tier.","replies":[]}]}
