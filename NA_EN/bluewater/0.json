However, whenever I try to uninstall League, i receive the message that there was an \"Error getting file security\", GetLastError: 5. I've tried everything I could think of. I deleted all files which contained \"riot\" and \"league\" from my pc, downloaded the hextech repair tool, scanned the computers registry, and tried uninstalling through the control panel and other applications. However, none of these worked. Can you help me with a solution? Thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-01T21:09:45.856+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your OS needs to essentially be given permission to alter certain files on your pc.
