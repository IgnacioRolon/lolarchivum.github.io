Also, never underestimate Cho'Gath mid. {{champion:31}} \n\n\n\nWhat I do best: I am a relatively strong laner, my cs decent, I tend to main champs that can farm safe in a bad matchup, I am also a decent shotcaller, I can ping with decent accuracy and I am versed in reading the enemy team (we're low elo after all). I've studied LeagueCraft and know the basics. I have really good reaction timing, mid-fight wards, reaction trades. I usually know how a fight is supposed to go for my team to win it. I always buy pinks and let my team where where the enemy jungler is.\n\n\nWhat to you do worst: I get nervous, I am a cautious player who sometimes spends a little too much time deliberating actions and consequences, other times I can make mistakes and end up getting 1v1ed by the enemy jungler, but I love invading and stomping early to push for that early dragon. Oh and I HATE playing against shaco xD\n\n\nTime Zone: ADT (eastern Canada)\n\nmost nights after 6-7pm.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Trufflie","date":"2016-03-16T20:52:17.750+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"who is calling for you guys and how much experience do they have","replies":[{"poster":"Karuka","date":"2016-03-16T21:33:37.553+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Trufflie,realm=NA,application-id=K6EGEal2,discussion-id=exf2Jgbh,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-03-16T20:52:17.750+0000)\n>\n> who is calling for you guys and how much experience do they have\n\nWell me for now and I shot called last season for a gold 1 team so I have an alright amount of experience in doing so","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MÃ­rthless","date":"2016-03-16T20:15:55.253+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Role: ad\nChampion pool: All ad's\nwhat do you do best: Farming,positioning, outplaying all that good ad stuff \nWhat to you do worst: lane wise i do my worst at top. playing wise i can greed\ntime zone: central\nwhen are you available: earlier than 2pm would be perfect but i know not everyone can do that. my scheduled if flexable\n{{sticker:zombie-nunu-bummed}} {{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}  <theses are so cool lol","replies":[{"poster":"Karuka","date":"2016-03-16T21:33:08.595+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=lmGrim,realm=NA,application-id=K6EGEal2,discussion-id=exf2Jgbh,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-03-16T20:15:55.253+0000)\n>\n> Role: ad\n> Champion pool: All ad's\n> what do you do best: Farming,positioning, outplaying all that good ad stuff \n> What to you do worst: lane wise i do my worst at top. playing wise i can greed\n> time zone: central\n> when are you available: earlier than 2pm would be perfect but i know not everyone can do that. my scheduled if flexable\n> {{sticker:zombie-nunu-bummed}} {{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}  <theses are so cool lol\n\nWe already have an ADC in me, if you play any other roles I'll be glad to try you out","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"im amplify","date":"2016-03-16T21:18:44.105+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Role: Mid\nChampion pool: Zed, Diana, LB, Kat, Viktor, Fizz, Annie, Ahri\nwhat do you do best:Farming, Roaming, teamfights, map awareness\nWhat to you do worst: Unconfident when behind, Laning phase against certain champs\ntime zone: ESt\nwhen are you available: all the time","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shangdi","date":"2016-03-16T21:03:41.015+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Role: Mid\nChampion Pool: {{champion:103}} {{champion:34}} {{champion:268}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:38}} {{champion:7}} {{champion:127}} {{champion:61}}{{champion:99}} {{champion:117}}  {{champion:161}} {{champion:112}} {{champion:101}} {{champion:238}} {{champion:26}} \nWhat do you do best: Laning, teamfighting, csing, positioning, wave control, almost everything.\nWhat to you do worst: Roaming, shotcalling.\nTime Zone: CST\nAvailability: 3pm-12pm","replies":[]}]}
