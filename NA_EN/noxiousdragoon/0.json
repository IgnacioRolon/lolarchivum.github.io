My internet is running fine and dandy. \r\nHowever, when I enter the champion select, the screen suddenly freezes. \r\n\r\nI couldn't do anything except close the client. After reopening it, I had to wait 30 mins and lost 10 LP (even though it was my first \r\nqueue dodge, as far as I remember). I was kind of pissed since the client simply froze and I had to deal with this penalty. Don't know if this\r\nis just me.\r\n\r\nYea it sounds like I'm whining but that just means I need to win one more game to get to where I wanted to get to now.","replies":[{"poster":"RiotBok","date":"2016-05-23T21:35:46.806+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I checked out your account and I'm seeing that you had another queue dodge a few hours beforehand as well, which is why it deducted 10 LP instead of 3. \n\nUsually when I hear \"client freeze\" in champ select, it's either a result of an actual game crash or the player getting disconnected from the server.  If you're consistently running into these kinds of freezes I'd check out our [Bug Splat/Game Crash](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes) article or our [Connection Troubleshooting ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues)article which have solutions to the most common causes we see.  Based on how you described the issue, I'd check out the Game Crash article first, but wanted to link both just in case!","replies":[{"poster":"Boobs are hot","date":"2016-05-25T01:56:57.440+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riotbok, this isn't just him or his internet. please please please!
