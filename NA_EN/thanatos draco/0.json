Since you're getting those unspecified errors now, I'd suggest grabbing the [**Hextech Repair Tool**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367-Automated-Troubleshooting-Hextech-Repair-Tool) and running a **reinstall and clean uninstall** while running the HRT as admin. After that, make sure to setup your [**permissions**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) again, and let me know if that helps or not.","replies":[{"poster":"Thanatos Draco","date":"2017-11-03T00:05:39.048+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ran it once and it failed for reasons unknown to me, I fiddled with some settings and am now rerunning it, it's made it to the reinstall segment this time, which I'm taking as a hopeful sign.
