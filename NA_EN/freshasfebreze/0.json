I just don't understand why people hated the 45 minute games. Those seemed the most tense and rewarding if you made a good play or stole an objective. Now, objectives don't even mean shit. Get one person fed as fuck and good luck stopping them.

Mechanics and reaction > macro play.  You don't need to to think to micro your way to diamond with Yasuo and its why he'll never be changed, Riot wants the game to be like this.  They want you to get a massive boner every time you use yet another moblity creeped ability, they want you to make a montage of every champ that can jump 90 thousand times in the span of 15 seconds, they want you to scream at the top of your lungs DID U SE DAT OUTPLAY OMGUR when you play this game.
