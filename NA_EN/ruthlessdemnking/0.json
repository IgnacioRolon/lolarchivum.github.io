I'm doing really well and who doesn't want to in the least bit show off their recent games with the champions they've been playing with? And for that not to be shown is quite pestering but figure if you go 13/0/9 with Lucian or Pantheon 20/6/4 you would want those Victories to show especially with the way it looks, I can take defeat but it's saddening when you scroll down and see reds and none of your recent good games show. Is there a bit of a glitch or current fix that's on it's way? Or at least let me know if I'm the only one having this issue. Thanks again for reading! Have a great rest of day!\r\n\r\n- Darion","replies":[{"poster":"Son Golin","date":"2016-03-29T20:07:34.636+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello RuthlessPhenom,\n\nI totally get where you're coming from, I've had times where there's only been a sea of red marks on my Match History and it'd be nice to see some Victorious matches especially since you earned it. I believe you're not seeing your recent matches in Match History due to the maintenance currently going on as indicated on the Server Status page:\n\nhttp://status.leagueoflegends.com/#na\n\nPlease check again once the maintenance is over!","replies":[{"poster":"RuthlessDeMnKiNg","date":"2016-03-29T21:34:02.815+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay, I guess I have good news and semi-bad news! So the semi-bad news is that Match History does not show, HOWEVER there was a exclamation point in League of Legends saying something about Advanced Match History and working on a fix so the good news is that I'm not the only one experiencing this issue. As for now, I just got out a game with Lucian might I add (14/2/10) *cough* anyways I restarted my client and the issue still persists. I checked that specific link you gave me, shows no recent errors as of this date, so somewhere along the lines I think they're still doing work... correct me if I'm wrong? Also when the maintenance is finished will it boot up the recent games that have not yet processed or will it take affect as soon as we play a game? Thanks for your time Son Golin! \n\n-Darion","replies":[{"poster":"RuthlessDeMnKiNg","date":"2016-03-29T21:39:12.025+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay update!
