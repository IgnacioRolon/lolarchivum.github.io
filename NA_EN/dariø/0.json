I never refunded the skin or anything it was just gone. Like a normal player would do, I emailed Riot Games support letting them know about the issue. Then i received an email from the billing team asking me to fill in all this information about my account. Next thing I know is I get another email saying this: Greetings ComicsHero, Actions that have been performed on your account are in violation of the League of Legends Terms of Use.
