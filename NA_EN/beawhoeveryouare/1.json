I&#039;ve found a few bugs of her and one really weird thing that was more funny then weird. The bugs I&#039;ve found:\r\n\r\n1: When Tristana runs her gun is normal, but when she stops instead of her old *gun goes foward and back* it actually glitches and goes on her shoulder. (I don&#039;t main Tristana so I can&#039;t be too sure about this one)\r\n2: Her dancing used to be she puts her gun next to her standing up, then dances like a soldier next to it. Every time I dance with her she glitches and grabs the back of the gun, then dances while holding the gun. The gun goes through her face and it&#039;s just funny.\r\n3: The funny bug I found: So me and my friend Nikeman58 were playing as a Brand and I Tristana, and we were on bottom lane. We were pushing up a Zyra and an Ashe I think (this and the Tristana bugs were a while ago, just never got around to posting it) and we pushed them all the way to the turret but when we were falling back a bit we saw what looked like a half sword half pin thing and it was at a I&#039;ma say 30* (can&#039;t do the dot thing) tilt   in the ground. It was also spinning not too fast but pretty fast and it was just barely off the ground. He and I saw it there and it wouldn&#039;t go. Also it would always go in front of our champs, not behind. Didn&#039;t get a picture of that one either but I badly drew it in paint. \r\n\r\nIf anyone else has noticed these glitches tell me, if there are any Tristana glitches I missed tell me too. I don&#039;t care if you fix these Riot (because they&#039;re pretty funny) just thought you&#039;d like to know about them and stuff so if you want to you can fix them.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-07-28T00:22:06.394+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey MonoTheMighty ,\n\nThanks for the report!
