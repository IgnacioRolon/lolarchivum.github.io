Miss KateyKhaos, I scrunched the numbers and did my research to bring you your one and only perfect mate. I give you, my cousin, ColeChaos. He's only lvl 10 cause he never plays but trust me, you'll love him. Have fun you two. ;) {{champion:53}} \r\n\r\n(P.S. I totally didn't just look at the names and came to the conclusion that you two belong together. This is totally not how my business works, how I just find a common ground and say your meant to be. That's totally not how I have Annie and Brand together or how I have Zyra and Maokai together. Blitzcrank out. *powers down*)","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-10-14T20:54:18.634+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey MonoTheMighty! \n\nOh, I see you've received my request! While only level 10, I think there is certainly room to grow. Are they a quick learner? Where might I find ColeChaos? Your Compatibility Service is giving me a 404 when trying to find my perfect match.

Glad you liked it though. I'd say if he tried he could probably learn pretty well, he doesn't really play it that's why he's lvl 10 but yea if you wanna play with him or something I could just tell him about it and see what he says (I did not get permission from him before doing this, that's how I gather no rust). Just tell me if you want me to tell him to get on LoL and play and I could set up a play date, though pretty sure it won't work out cause he and I are only 15. ;D Have fun Katey!","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-10-19T18:50:55.732+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We should definitely play a game!
