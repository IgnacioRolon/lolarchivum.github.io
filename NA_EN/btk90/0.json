Before the update it was possible to (de)select the option \"Show Owned\" in champions tab and the game would remember it being on-or-off, so the next time it would be the same. Everytime I go to the store now, I have to click the \"Show Owned\" to be able to hide the champions I own. It's not a big deal of course, but I believe the older, permanent choice was a lot easier and more convenient. Is there some possiblity to 'lock' the option I might have overlooked? Or would this perhaps be integrated in any future update?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-31T20:43:44.406+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What you're experiencing is normal behavior with the new shop, as I was able to reproduce it with my own account.
