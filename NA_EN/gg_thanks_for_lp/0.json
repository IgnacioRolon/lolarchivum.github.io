Heres my thoughts.\n\n>So on the one hand you guys cry that you can't carry games anymore and only the worst player in team decides the outcome of the game.\n\nWhich is true. One laner goes 1/9 top/mid/bot/jg, and they screw the game over. This isnt a \"Oh the enemy is good at the game, its just unlucky.\" Its mostly the person who is dying a lot is potentially auto-filled, playing a champion they don't know, or just aren't good in general. In the seasons before season 8, dying 7+ times in laning phase (about the first 15 minutes), would usually mean that person was either facing a smurf, or intentionally feeding. This season, people are dying 7+ every game during laning phase, whether its on your team or the enemy team.\n\n>But on the other hand SOMEHOW the enemy Laner CAN snowball and \"win the entire game\" aka \"CARRY the game\"??? ü§î\n\nYes... Imagine, your autofilled top laner is getting stomped because they can just die within seconds due to the insane damage. Now not only does the top laner get the gold from killing the autofilled top laner, but hes also getting about 1000+ gold from destroying the tower. Literally anyone will win lane against someone who doesnt know their champion, or lane theyre playing in. Most of the time the snowballing is based on luck, and jungler help as well. I cant tell you how many times ive played in Plat 3 elo and had some random Gold 4 player on our team that has a 49% overall wr, and yes, that gold 4 player ends up getting stomped by the plat 3 players.\n\n>So what should Riot do in your opinion??\nIf they rewarding good players for good plays (so they can carry), everyone is screaming \"OMG SO MUCH SNOWBALL\"\n>But if they dont, everyone screams \"OMG YOU CANT CARRY GAMES ANYMORE!!\"\n\nThey're not even making good plays tho, thats the thing. Players arent even going for cs anymore because kills are more worth while. The cs gold isnt even the thing that matters the most, its the Exp you get from the cs, which you dont need to last hit them to require the exp. Everyone is going to burst everyone no matter the gold lead, unless you are stacking health, then you wont get bursted so hard. \n\nIf Riot wants to fix this game, they need to nerf overall starting damage level one, they need to make CSing a major part of ranking up again, get rid of bounties, and lessen the amount of gold received from tower plating. Farming cs used to be a major skill to require in this game, today I am seeing people in Plat 5 that have ranked up to Plat 2 by only getting 5-6 cs/m. Not only that, I watched a few plat players stream, and they will miss tons and tons of abilities, but yet theyre still ranking up. There is 0 reason a plat player should be getting less than 7 cs/m and still be ranking up, absolutely 0.\n\n>I bet everything is ok if YOU are the one who is carrying am i right?\n\nActually carrying today isnt fun like it used to be. Because being the one carrying before season 8 was something you didnt see everyday. I remember thats what first inspired me to want to get better at League. We had a Nocturne Jungler in season 5 or 6 that was going ham all game, completely dominating the game (he was smurfing from plat elo we were in Silver 2). The enemy team was surprised at how good the Nocturne was at the game. Today, someone is carrying every single game. Its not fun, its nothing new, its not impressive, and all honesty its pretty boring when youre the carry. \"Oh im carrying, I can now kill enemies in .46 seconds, how fun.\" Point is, everyone is a carry, seeing someone carry used to be impressive before season 8, carrying is boring today.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2018-11-25T13:39:46.733+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"but I want to use my big brain and walk down top lane 1v5 as a tank while splitpushing and survive every hit long enough for the rest of my team to shove down mid and win the game (ofc getting several kills from people noticing at different times and meeting their push one at a time)\n\nSo at the end of the game I‚Äôll be 0/20 (all 20 deaths are from laning phase and I earned the comeback) but I did that cool 900 IQ Rick and morty big brain play so I can turn around and say ‚Äúlol my team sucks I carried this team stupid adc thinks that simply because he did more dmg and kills and gave less gold and got more towers he‚Äôs better but he doesn‚Äôt understand pressure like I do‚Äù","replies":[]},{"poster":"6KEMBE4ORBA","date":"2018-11-25T10:02:03.084+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not that simple aka black & white.\n\nTower plating is good as an idea, gives way too much gold for nothing.

The one resource that had been completely untouched and ignored in Runes and Masteries, more scarce (and obviously broken) than even MS, was Vision. Then they add a selection of Vision Runes to the game and big surprise... we lost Green Smite and Sightstone, Yellow trinket is nerfed, we need to further limit how many CW can be carried. Who asked for Vision-related Runes?","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Rƒ±ots Bad Client","date":"2018-11-24T10:05:55.821+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":4,"body":"I dunno, I think the balance team is okay. not perfect.

Ha, that would explain A LOT.\n\nAnyway, poster didn't insist that it was one person.

OP.gg or whatever popular stat site at the moment does not account for Normal draft or Blind pick, Or any rankings below platinum. we just finished worlds and are going into a preseason where they go wild with balance changes that built up that needed to be done, they wont fuck up worlds after the shitshow that was the juggernaut rework. \nthey also have to be super fucking careful about nerfing/buffing champions now. Do yall remember Olaf? He got super popular and then riot nerfed every single aspect of his kit, his items, base stats. and anything else about him because he spiked in popularity. So they take longer nerfing champions by doing slight nerfs here and there. Yes there IS some that should've been nerfed harder and quicker than they really were (Zoe) But most of them its better for the 1-2 slight nerfs otherwise a champion will get overnerfed and be in a horrible state. \nI almost feel like some of yall wouldn't even survive the early season 1-3 days when picking Eve was a banable offense, and every 2 weeks a new champion would come out that didnt even work half the time and would suddenly be 1shotting everyone after they got buffed up then their bugs fixed. It was awful, i enjoy the current league atm because i feel more incontrol of my own actions.","replies":[]}]}
