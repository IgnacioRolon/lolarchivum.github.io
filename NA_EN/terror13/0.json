Riot was able to get a lock on the market. They didn't do it by doing anything that original, they did it by copying and piggybacking off others. They are successful because people love gaming. And if you are going to do competitive gaming you want to play where there are the most players. They are successful because we tolerate Riot and their success is based on selling RP, their entire business model depends on getting players to spend money on RP. So they rope people in by playing on their impatience or desire to win, by letting certain champions be OP, or purposely making new champions OP so people want to buy them imediately. This is a company with no integrity. Go research Marc Merill thoughts on eSports. Hes a total moron, which is why it takes the top 7 LOL tournament to equal the pay out of the top DOTA 2 tournament. These people aren't smart or genius. They are just average people who positioned themselves in a market at the right time, and unless they pull their head out of the asses, they are going to go the way of World of Warcraft.

LoL has been on top for what, years? That's not a fluke borne of some \"we got lucky and copied stuff at the right time in gaming history\" crap. \n\nAlso, to bring integrity into the argument means nothing. A lack of integrity does not mean you lack the business acumen or product knowledge to still produce top tier results. They don't go hand in hand. You could look at the tournament payouts, but that's silly. If a tournament is bigger and makes more income, yet pays less out to contestants, how is that dumb from a business perspective? Could you imagine if Jeapordy only had to give out a few hundred dollars to the winner yet retained the same amount of viewers?  It would save money. \n\nYou have some of the worst arguments that I've come across.

No. It was about marketing, and convenience.  \n\nJust because Riot makes money doesn't mean the product is quality or good for a competitive eSport. The quality is shit, and will continue to be shit until they are forced to make changes due to market changes.  For example, they way McDonalds had to add in healthy options like oatmeal and shit to meet the changing demand in the market.  Riot is like McDonalds.

McDonald's sells food which is a necessity. You're forced to buy it and eat it. The motivators that factor in to one's food choices is vastly different than the motivators that factor in to one's entertainment choices. \n\nMcDonald's is known for convenience (quick drive through and an easy menu) and cost efficiency (hello full belly on $4). Those things are important when you're talking about food. Not as much when you're looking at video games. \n\nLoL can't be much more accessible than they are now. I mean, they could launch a platform based thing, or make the game able to be played from a mobile device, but that's not really a feasible solution to increasing convenience. It's not like other games are heavily gated through layers of hoops to jump through and play a game and LoL is able to be double-clicked and you're playing. \n\nAlso, the other big one is affordability. All the big mobas have a slightly different pay structure and LoL is actually one of the harshest from what I've seen. (I've never played DOTA or Overwatxh or anything. I've played a little Smite.) You get a handful of free champions and have to pay to unlock permanently usable champs. You can either farm IP for years, or you can pay some steep RP prices.

A truly balanced game would see greater variety of team comps because the advantage of one champion over another would not be so pronounced as it is now. This would make for more interesting games. And you would see a greater distribution of champions that are banned.  To say that the complaints are just the wanking of the masses takes away any possibility of looking at whether or not Riot is screwing up? \n\nWas it wrong when all the unhappy ones came to boards for a year demanding Solo Que back, after Marc Merrill condescendingly explained to us all why we were wrong? \n\nWas it wrong for us to keep nagging Riot to give us a sandbox mode after they made it clear they didnt want to make one?\n\nShould we have no complained about how strong the reworked Poppy was?\n\nThe list can go on and on. SO many decision that were objectively bad, that Riot later had to correct.Sometimes months or a year later, despite the fact that the customers...ie you and me and the rest of us, knew immediately the decision was bad. \n\nSo don't tell me that Riot knows what they are doing. Just because each individual who works at Riot might be good at their job, it doesn't mean that they are being pulled together with good leadership or that the way teams communicate with each other is good enough.

There is a \"soft cap\" on the amount of people that you will be able to bring in and retain. WoW was in its heyday like a year or so after Ghostcrawler went there. It was a subscriber base that was never going to be sustained. Every game hits a peak and then goes down from there. Regardless of who was at the helm, WoW was not going to retain their 12+ million subscribers. It's the same for LoL. They will not retain their peak numbers. That's why it's a peak. \n\nAlso, people always seem to have this nostalgic memory of things they did in the past. This isn't just with games, but holds especially true with games. Think of it as a relationship. In the beginning you get those \"everything is new\" butterfly feelings and it's oh so sweet. But after years of the same game, that new feeling goes away. Yeah there may be new classes and dungeons or game modes or whatnot, but that's like wearing different makeup or dying your hair. It's still the same thing with a different look. Things are always better when they're new. \n\nNow you point to Ghostcrawler as the reason WoW went downhill but you're missing the fact that it peaked about a year after he went to Blizzard. Now you can try and say that it was his predecessor's projects that lead to the continued growth after he took over as lead there, but then there's the fact that the game got a huge boost in subscriptions about a year after he left to LoL. Those are projects that he would have been involved in and help to cultivate. \n\nOn top of that, while Ghostcrawler was with WoW during its years of initial decline, it was a slow downward trend. After he left and the new expansion quickly fizzled out, subs dropped like crazy. Perhaps if he had been there, the decline would not have been so steep. \n\nAs to LoL and it's numbers, Ghostcrawler took over at the beginning of 2014. By like every metric that I've seen, LoL has done nothing but continue to grow and become the largest game in the world. That's with Ghostcrawler having been in charge for 3 years. \n\nI'm not saying everything he touches is gold, but the guy has a good track record everywhere he's been.
