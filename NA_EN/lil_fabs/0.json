I was in series and had a 1-1 win lose and since the client glitched out I got a loss. I do not think that is fair what so ever since that was out of my control and  I got penalized for it. I had no chance in choosing a champion and it just stayed stuck on the first players champ select. This is ridiculous because this is the second time that has happened to me.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-27T15:50:00.956+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That really sucks, especially since it cost your series.  :(  This could be happening for a few reasons, and it's really important to tackle it so it doesn't keep happening.  Are you using any third party programs running that interact with league?  They have been known to cause issues during champ select so I suggest removing them.  Do you also have [low spec mode](https://i.gyazo.com/a39e12ca76e54359342203c476a0e9c1.png) enabled?  Usually, issues like this are caused by connection problems but I want to rule out possibilities with the client after the recent transition.  Test it in a custom and let me know.","replies":[{"poster":"Lil Fabs","date":"2017-04-28T02:03:56.707+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for getting back to me. I do have the client in low spec mode and also do not have any third party programs that run with league. It sucked the most because it was a series match. Just really wished the client was 100% before it was released but hey it happens","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kittysora","date":"2017-04-27T02:11:07.747+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am having the same issue too.
