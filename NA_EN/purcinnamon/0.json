I know league has added many things or gimmicks to the new health bars but the look of it is very bad and it has a slower healing and damaging. i think they should make options for using the hp bars or not. The gimmicks don't help me either in any way. I might get used to it eventually but pls make a option to go to the old health bar","replies":[{"poster":"CrabDust","date":"2017-12-06T20:05:43.085+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Damage is actually quicker than it used to be and healing is still instantaneous.

Like maybe Red's could be wooden with ferns and hints of red while Blue's would be stone with blue energy coursing through.","replies":[{"poster":"Cant Land Kicks","date":"2017-12-07T11:54:39.719+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really like this idea, give the health bars some flare while you're reworking them. As a jungle otp i'd really appreciate something like this.
