But when the only diamond player on the other team (or in the game) cleans us up 1v5 and has over 80% of the kills, this should be considered a problem.  I mean are there so few mid laners in gold to bronze range now the system needs to go to such a skill gap to fill in the teams?  I am all for a challenge but when 1 player unbalances the teams to this point, why even play the game?  Makes you want to afk for 30 minutes and quite frankly I don't want to queue up to run into this scenario again.\r\n\r\nThis has happened many times and I understand riot wants to make shorter queue times but in my skill range, it should not be hard to find many evenly skilled players.  It's hard enough finding time to get a casual game in and then when you do, you get this.","replies":[{"poster":"Son of Ornn","date":"2017-07-04T03:39:50.936+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's a part of the game, but getting shrekt by 1 player can be really disheartening. Getting matched against somebody in a higher ranked tier than you should be rare. That said, that's only the case in Ranked queues. If you're playing games in Norms or in ARAMs or event modes, then that queue will use an entirely different ladder and MMR to match you guys.\n\nIn short, Ranked Tiers only apply to match making in the queue they're relevant in. If you're getting matched against Diamonds when you're in Silver there, that's a problem, and I'd suggest hitting up Game Support to talk about it [**in a ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). But when playing outside of those queues, you should expect to play with and against a lot of different skill levels since the MMR there is different from Ranked.","replies":[]}]}
