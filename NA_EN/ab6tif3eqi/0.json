Not really, he falls off super hard around the 20 minute mark.\n\nYou can carry by split pushing and taking objectives though.

He plays more mindgames than Teemo when youre trying to recall with less than 200 hp.\nHe is the last thing people want to see when cutting it close on that 2nd buff clear.\n\nAwesome champ once you understand his playstyle, and so many fun plays can be made as you juke them back and forth.\n\n\nPS check out \"shaclone\" he is an awesome shaco player and he played shaco into master/challenger.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/Shaclone/videos","replies":[]},{"poster":"Toothierosprey3","date":"2015-02-22T00:33:26.224+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"He can carry in silver, just gank a lot and get your team snowballing.

He's great pre-6, but once he reaches 11+ he falls flat on his face like a rock.\n\nIf he builds durability he hits like a wet noodle.\nIf he builds damage he's as durable as wet tissue paper.\nIf he has no money at all then he might as well sit in base.","replies":[]}]}
