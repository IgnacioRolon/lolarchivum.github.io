Maybe they could make the pirate buff 3/5, instead of 2/4?  Otherwise it's still very possible and easy to get 4.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"A Goguma","date":"2019-09-15T22:45:55.138+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah pirates are useless...times i get 1 gold each round, times i get boots or fish bones most others....\n\nbuff pirates...\n\nnerf glacial...","replies":[{"poster":"Ariel the Cruel","date":"2019-09-23T22:55:10.993+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My last game I started with pirates and ate a loss streak to try and stack gold early.\nMultiple rounds in a row, got 0 gold chests.\n\nFor 3 pirates with no other synergy (Excluding gunslinger if you live long enough to find a Miss Fortune), I should *at least* get 1 gold per round.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TwitchInMyPants","date":"2019-09-15T22:46:59.490+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wouldn't give Pirates items since that'd be insane but the breakpoints make sense.  Pirates offer nothing in combat so having more rewards for going for less synergies would make Pirates more rewarding.
