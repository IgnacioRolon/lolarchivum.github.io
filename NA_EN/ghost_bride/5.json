Once the PBE changes do land, Runeglaive gains up to +25 base damage on the proc. Mystic Shot's AP scaling *was* taken into account between Lich Bane and Runeglaive, though.\n\nIn the absolute best scenario--which doesn't exist because there isn't a champion with scaling MR and 60 base Armor at level 18--it would take Ezreal ~170 AP for Lich Bane to start dealing more damage. In the opposite best scenario--and I don't know of any champions with 90-ish base Armor and no scaling MR either--it would take 500 AP.\n\nUsing these numbers, it comes down to this; Lich Bane Ezreal gets a tidbit more single-target damage once he passes 300 AP in normal situations. But you have to *get* to that amount of AP for it to matter. Never mind that Runeglaive is AoE, so the moment it hits two targets, it's dealing more total damage *period.*\n\nAt the point of 700 AP, Lich Bane is doing in the neighborhood of 50 more damage to one target, give or take, without taking into account *any* defensive building at all on the target, runes or masteries.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Lugg","date":"2015-07-05T01:36:03.438+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"AP Ezreal was strong before, the problem with runeglaive is that it speeds up his power spikes.
