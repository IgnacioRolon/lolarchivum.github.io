If someone was to upload the game files through another means there's a chance that the files could become corrupted and not work properly, which could cause your game to crash in matches. \n\nSince you've got those data caps at the moment, you could try going to a pc cafe or something similar to get it downloaded or possibly a friend's house if that's an option.","replies":[{"poster":"killzonefury619","date":"2017-05-29T06:41:29.727+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know how to do it properly as i have done it before 2-3 times when i was ganna format my pc and copied the files in a USB.Its not really a developed city so there is no chance to find a internet cafe and people here are more into grocery stores rather than technical stuff. Hence the data plans are also for daily use(eg:1gb per/day for 3 months just for approx 10$). And similar plans like that. If i could pause the downloads i could get it done within 2-3 days and so i need that riot games folder uploaded. The one and only way :(","replies":[]}]}]}
