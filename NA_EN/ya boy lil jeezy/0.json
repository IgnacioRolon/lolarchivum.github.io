A few weeks back I received my first ever ban for 13 days. 13 DAYS WOW! For toxic behavior, which yes I was being toxic but I also had a pantheon following me wherever I went all game and he took all my CS just because he didn&#039;t get mid lane. Now just 2 days after being unbanned I ended a game and everyone reported me because I did bad...it was my 2nd time ever playing mordikaiser, I wasn&#039;t toxic, I even have the chatlog and everyone was being way more toxic to me. Now I am perma banned...like is this serious? The report option is so badly abused if I can&#039;t be unbanned I think this game is a joke, I have NEVER played another game where your first punishment is 13 whole \ndays...only to be followed up with a perma ban, this is just outrageous.
