I had to stop playing because of school but now I want to get back into it. However, the client updated and none of my login information updated and when I recovered my account nothing is there. None of the champions I had, runes, or skill points. and it made me choose a new summoner name even though if I look i can see my old summoner profile. Any Idea how I can recover this stuff or find my old login info?","replies":[{"poster":"Vëë","date":"2017-04-25T11:09:18.700+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Something similar happened to me. I was played league 3 days ago, I ONLY HAVE ONE ACCOUNT. I get the new client today, I log in as I usually do, and it asked me to type in a summoner name, so I entered my summoner name (Yordle Jihadist) and it said the name was taken, so I just typed in a random name so I could play, and it REPLACED Yordle Jihadist with Vëë, Yordle Jihadist was lvl 30 with all champs and alot of skins, this summoner is lvl 1... I have tried everything and cannot find out how to get Yordle Jihadist back... I have never made another account and I have always logged into the NA region... this is really sad I can't do anything, I cant even play!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Blaze275","date":"2017-04-25T04:46:15.315+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"cant recover my account i was level thirty and my account was gone it started me over again when i logged in what to do my other name was Dzzzzzznuts please help me\n","replies":[{"poster":"Kürama","date":"2017-04-25T05:13:22.112+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Communicate with Riot’s[ Account Recovery Centre](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=72416)\n\nThe primary category is already selected.
