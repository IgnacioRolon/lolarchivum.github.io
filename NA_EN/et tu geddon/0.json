Any reason that would be and no im honor 3 so atleast thats not why X). I mean i asume normal games counts as matchmade games too.

It looks like some players did not get the 2017 Worlds Championship icon after completing the mission.  Our devs are aware, and will be sending it out to eligible players.  Hang tight while that gets reviewed and distributed!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Eternal Seeκers","date":"2017-09-21T20:58:08.945+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"+1","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-21T22:54:55.617+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is likely caused by the icon you have equipped.  You'll want to specifically use a Worlds icon from the past or in the [announcement ](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/esports/esports-editorial/worlds-2017-missions-loot)page.  The first mission icon works too!\n\nUnless I'm not understanding the issue correctly.  Did you complete the mission for the 2017 World Championship Icon but not receive it?  I double checked your account, and it doesn't look like the quest was successfully completed.  Will see what's up.\n\n\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"NoMoneyNoDonate","date":"2017-09-26T12:53:33.954+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you can put last years icon..If you dont have it you have problem and the admins must do smth about it","replies":[]},{"poster":"BìO slingrefitte","date":"2017-09-21T21:05:11.673+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ye same problem and im god damn honor level 5 won aram games and ranked games still no icon","replies":[{"poster":"Ziegla","date":"2017-09-24T20:20:27.213+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=BìO Bønna,realm=EUNE,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=eTwJ9o2n,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2017-09-21T21:05:11.673+0000)\n>\n> Ye same problem and im god damn honor level 5 won aram games and ranked games still no icon\n\nLevel 5 honor doesn't matter dude.. :P","replies":[]},{"poster":"shadowlegolas","date":"2017-09-22T08:58:46.030+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have the same problem i played 4 games and won 3 of them and i didnot get the icon and i still have the mission uncompleted what shoud i do ?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BioVisionary","date":"2017-09-22T21:24:10.595+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i didnt get my 2017 Worlds Championship icon also... cant start my other missing because of that :/","replies":[]}]}
