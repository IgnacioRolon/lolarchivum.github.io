I've seen a lot of feeders lately. A ton actually. Actually, for a long period of time I've seen a ton of feeders consistently in games.

You are condescending, and indirectly insulting, and you can go fuck yourself.\n\nQuit wasting my time. Everything you said is ignoring the actual issue. I'm done talking about it with you, as clearly you are attempting to blame me. I do not respect the blue tag, as I've never seen any blue tag say anything worth a shit.
