I&#039;m more or less just a casual player &#039;round Silver MMR, and pretty much just had shower thoughts that resulted in this post, the TL:DR being\r\n\r\nTL:DR: AP Juggernauts. Will we see new ones in the future, or other work on AP Juggernauts like itemization? \r\n\r\nAll the [juggernauts](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/3A5uuBw7-champion-subclass-list) except for {{champion:82}} seem to be AD, or at least not AP (In the case of Voli and Mundo being 100% tank build). And most of the work on Juggernauts seems to be based on the AD side of them. \r\n\r\nMorde seemed to fail more-so because there was so much shit going on at once in his rework with too little development time, rather than the idea of an AP Juggernaut. But with more time you could definitely work out kinks better. For example the time given to {{champion:420}}  resulting in a champ in an ok spot, despite what happened to {{champion:86}} {{champion:122}} and{{champion:72}} when they were reworked.\r\n\r\nThere does seem like a lot of space for neat things you could do with AP Juggernauts too. Due to weaker AAs (From being an AP), you could add more room for windows of power on a new AP Juggernaut (Which would seem to fix some of the issues people had with playing against Juggernauts). You could also try things like say an AP Juggernaut version of {{item:3071}} .\r\n\r\nNot saying you guys need to or should do work on AP Juggernauts, just that there seems to be some interesting factors in that kind of design space.
