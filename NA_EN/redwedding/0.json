I would link it here but I do not want to draw attention to it. OP was saying that they did not deserve bans, as they did not swear and only told people to go kill themselves. Which, according to them, was not that bad.\r\n\r\nYou escalated their ban to permanent, citing death threats, and OP raged and raged, saying that telling someone to kill themselves was in no way a death threat.\r\n\r\nHe was right. It isn't a death threat; it is much, much worse.\r\n\r\nI have been at a point where if someone had told me to go kill myself, I would have done it. Even if they were some faceless stranger across the internet. I know that others I have played with have been in the same spot. I know that many I haven't even seen would feel the same. Depression is real. Telling someone to kill themselves is not a death threat, it is a potentially lethal attack.\r\n\r\nI just wanted to say thank you. I know you get a lot of flak for doing what you do over on the player behavior team, but- at the risk of sounding melodramatic- you may have saved someone's life. So thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n~ RedWedding.","replies":[{"poster":"Crazycatperson","date":"2014-10-01T21:46:20.868+0000","up_votes":56,"down_votes":1,"body":"Just remember that there's another human behind that computer screen, and no one deserves to be treated like that. +1","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2014-10-01T22:01:40.015+0000","up_votes":43,"down_votes":3,"body":"^ Nicely said.","replies":[{"poster":"DustStorm181","date":"2014-10-01T22:43:41.263+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":3,"body":"really said nice","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"RedWedding","date":"2014-10-02T04:00:46.138+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"This.

We don't like toxicity, we don't think it belongs in League, but taking the extra step of standing up to it is a very difficult thing to do--it's just easier to let things slide, and mind our own business ya know? \n\nI think more and more, the goals of the team are to empower players to stand up once in awhile and reject toxicity. To give the silent majority an easy way to have a voice.
