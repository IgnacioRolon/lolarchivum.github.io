If you had 2 before, you have 2 now. I had 10 before, I have 10 now. NOTHING about rune pages has changed except what we put in the rune pages. There is absolutely zero reason to presume you are owed free rune pages. \r\nAlso STOP complaining about the preset rune stuff [you will be able to hide these in a few weeks, its just to ensure you have those basic options if you do not understand rune selection during champ selection]. Bunch of whinny babies I swear. \r\n\r\nSecondly: Blue essence, someone posted you only get 70 essence a level, this is FALSE 100% FALSE. Every level you will get almost the equivalent in ip you would have gained had you gotten ip every one of those games. For example, when I hit level 31 it took about 9 games. I was given a single champion shard that disenchanted into 1157 blue essence. You may be given more then one shard or you may just be given one, the point is you are given a good amount of blue essence PLUS champion shards which are cheap to create champions with.... [Disclaimer: I may be biased because after the update I now own every champion in the game]. \r\n\r\nThirdly: The runes are not over power, they are not unfair, there is nothing not fair about it. You as a player 100% have it within your power to mimic someones build completely and utterly to the tee. The runes are 100% free, you are given 2 free base rune pages. There is no reason to complain, if its op then copy the op. \r\n\r\nFourth: &quot;But T&igrave;na people can kill people at level 1 now&quot;.... Then go kill people at level 1..... Seriously....\r\n\r\nFifth: &quot;League is copying Overwatch and HOTS systems&quot;.... So...? Its a successful and thoroughly tested system, and the system is not not protected by any legal means. Its just a new and different way to advance game-play and rewards. CLEARLY some of you guys [most] did not play league in S1-S4, where you had to utterly GRIND for champions, and you had to PAY for skins. Now you can earn skins [OF COURSE ITS SLOW WHY WOULD IT BE FAST RIOT STILL NEEDS TO MAKE MONEY, so if you want skins fast PAY for them if not EARN them]. But you are given so many avenues to develop your account through this game. Its ridiculous people complain every time they are given more. \r\n\r\n\r\nPost to long to read summarized- stop whining like an entitled baby, stop jumping on the band wagon of complaining users, play for a month or so and then give us your experience, stop using day 1 as an indicator of the value of this game.","replies":[]}
