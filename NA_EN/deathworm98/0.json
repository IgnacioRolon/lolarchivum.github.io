So here is my problem. Casually just playing some league of legends, everyone is locked in for a great ranked game, and boom; my game crashes as soon as I try to load in and the league of legends crash window comes up. I have had this problem for the past month and even gotten a new PC to try out the bug, and it still happens. This isn't even the worst part, as when I can finally fix the issue temporarily, I get an AFK ban for 20 minute, low priority que, for about 10 games. How is this fair? Riot this is your problem and then when I spend my time trying to fix it I am rewarded with a ban.... and I am sure I am not the only one with this problem. Riot, I love your game and your community and everything, so much I have even put in my own money into the game. But after 6 seasons and almost season 7 so this shouldn't be happening. I am not very happy but I would like this ban to be waved off or something because this was out of my control. I have sent many crash reports to Riot and nothing happens.... Thank you.{{champion:112}} \n\nP.S. I love the devil teemo!{{champion:17}}\n\nAnother thing, yes your repair sort of works. But it takes forever and by that time my team has remaked and I am banned. But I have to use the repair every single time this happens and it says my game files are corrupted, would you like us to search through them and fix it or something on those lines. Why are the files not working if nothing is happening to them?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-06T16:24:09.806+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds really strange that you would have to constantly repair to fix these crashes, so I'm curious if there are other culprits here like driver issues.
