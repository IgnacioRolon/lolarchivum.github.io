A civil discussion should be left open to keep the community strong. If the game doesn't suit the players, there is no game. RIP Treeline. If you want the game to suit the players, you let them voice their concerns, and you take their concerns seriously enough to do something. Treeline for example, might have gained more players had Riot listened to the concerns current players were facing. Riot chose to ignore the concerns because of a dwindling player base. The relationship is inherently destructive.\r\n\r\n**2- Moderators are there to encourage open discussion, and keep things civil.**\r\nEnforcing any \"Rules\" that circumvent the essence of an open, civil discussion is an abuse of their position. Anytime a post is made regarding concerns about Mods, then Mods will adhere to crude explanations about how criticising their positions is just creating a platform to harass people. \r\n\r\nEssentially, Mods just can't handle any scrutiny about their positions, and will remove any posts that threaten their authority. \r\nMods are a concern to many players, and this is a platform for all the players to be able to voice their concerns. \r\nMods shouldn't be allowed to interfere with any posts that are trying to have a civil discussion about REASONS Mods are ineffective. \r\n\r\nIf a Mod reads reasons they are damaging to the Boards, no matter how civilly stated these reasons are, Mods will take it as a personal attack. \r\nThis needs to stop. \r\nIf anybody has the authority to monitor these specific discussions, that authority needs to be with Riot employees specifically.\r\n\r\n**STATING REASONS THAT MODS ARE INEFFECTIVE IS NOT DESIGNED AS ATTACKS, BUT SIMPLY OBSERVATIONS OF INEFFECTIVENESS**","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2019-08-27T23:03:23.810+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":1,"body":"We typically don't remove posts protesting mods, as long as it meets two main guidelines:\n\n* It is placed on an appropriate board.\n* It is critical without being insulting.\n\nAs this board (**Discuss the Boards**) itself is testament to, there are a *lot* of critical threads that we leave up, because they're not breaking any rules.\n\nCritique away.

There's nothing rhetorical about people speaking up against certain behavior not being reprimanded. \nSo when a _**part**_ of the community is feeling harassed by the _**parts**_ of the community you favor, nothing is done about it. \n\nFor example: When people feel that chat restrictions are unfair because they allow certain types of harassment that seemingly go unnoticed by Riot and Mods- nobody is making any attempt to make sure these players are able to play the game without feeling harassed. \n\nIt's basic psychology. If the roles were reversed and the \"favorites\" were feeling harassed, and nobody did anything about it, they would be just as \"toxic\". It's an injustice. The system only works for people YOU UNDERSTAND. And frankly, Mods aren't diversified enough to represent us all. And they never will be because there's a clear discrimination factor in who is allowed to have a \"privileged\" Boards account. And that discrimination rests in the hands of Mods. Mods will never be useful because they will never be able to represent fairness for ALL players.\nAnd because you can't or refuse to represent these players- you simply label them as toxic and STEAL everything they worked so hard for. \n\nThe entire report system, in-game and on-Boards is abused. More than 95% of reports are submitted by people that flamed games. More than half of Boards reports are the retaliations from a type of harassment that Mods allow.","replies":[{"poster":"Ulanopo","date":"2019-08-28T01:22:57.733+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Glamorous Rammus,realm=NA,application-id=6heBIhQc,discussion-id=o1j0fg6g,comment-id=0002000000010002,timestamp=2019-08-28T01:06:47.945+0000)\n> \n>More than half of Boards reports are the retaliations from a type of harassment that Mods allow.\n\nI'm curious where you got that statistic.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BlackKnightJack","date":"2019-08-28T00:04:00.729+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":10,"body":">This is inaccurate though.
