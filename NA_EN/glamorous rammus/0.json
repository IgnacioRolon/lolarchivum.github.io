And that's awesome, we all have our own views. I believe we are all one giant brain, separated by an illusion, and truly part of a \"collective consciousness\", but we all have our own observations that are like independent ideas inside a single mind. \r\nKind of a ramble of a disclaimer, but I want you to know when you read this, I actually DO value your opinions- I just hope we can all learn to value each other's and have more forward discussions, I believe we can have a better impact on what Riot needs to do if we can have better conversations with each other. \r\n\r\n**Forward Thinking:**\r\n\r\nSo if you don't recognize my name, I'm pretty outspoken against \"rules\". I've always been labeled as \"insubordinate\", I just see rules as a way to restrict good-intentioned people. \r\nSo when I discuss on Boards about, basically, \"the rules suck\"- I expect people to disagree, and state their opinions. Unfortunately, there is no **discussion**. When someone disagrees, they simply state the stance we already know exists and add nothing to justify the stance given. \r\nThere seems to be a lack of forward thinking in many of these responses. Simply \"copy pasting\" the rule book doesn't add to the conversation. It actually brings the conversation backwards. \r\nLook at it like this-\r\nWhen someone posts about \"X Rule\" should not exist. A proper response is not to go backward and say \"X is a rule\". Saying, \"X Rule should not exist\", has already observed that \"X is a rule\". \r\nBasically, the person is saying, \"X is a rule that exists, and this is why it shouldn't exist.\" Reposnding to that statement with \"X is a rule\" literally does nothing to facilitate a forward discussion, it just repeats what's already been stated.\r\n\r\nPlease, we all need to take the time to read what someone is saying. And not just to form a response. We should read the information a second time if we need to. \"Read that again\". \r\nAnd if we can see that person's perspective, it helps to always acknowledge their points before debating them if we still disagree.

Be proud of your insubordination all you want, but you're fighting a losing fight against Riot's \"rules.\" They are allowed to have their rules.

There really isn't a way to force people to talk and people shouldn't have to be forced to talk.\n\nSecondly, give your OP a sound argument.

Why does honor govern your Elo cap too? \nI mean it doesn't directly, but they basically put people is shit ELOs who have lost honor, and place zero honor people with other zero honor people, which means placing trolls with trolls, and having a bottom of the barrel team building process.... not fair. \n\nBut if you are \"good\" and do what Riot says, then you can advance in rank, because you'll be carried by nice player with honor points....\n\nThis system seems very unfair to me. \n\nIt is one thing for the game to have bans and punishments for being a dick, but a whole other to keep players down by grouping them into a bronze prison they will never escape.","replies":[{"poster":"Prandine","date":"2019-09-01T12:47:47.639+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=DBS Ronovon,realm=NA,application-id=6heBIhQc,discussion-id=byNaeKqg,comment-id=000200010000,timestamp=2019-09-01T11:23:08.073+0000)\n>\n> I like discussing this topic, and you make good points.

Of course I have.\nDo I let it out? You bet I do.\nDo I do so in the chat? No, I just yell and rage at the screen instead. Not only is it faster than typing (at least to me anyways) but it also doesn't compromise my teams chances of success. Plus as a bonus I don't run the risk of being punished for poor behavior.\n\nNone of us are perfect and we all have our limits, and I've certainly gotten an earful when I yell and rage in real life. That said I've noticed that the people who wind up being permabanned are the ones who are often unwilling to seek and/or use other outlets to vent their frustrations at. They are also often the ones who get surprised and mad when they're suddenly permabanned for their consistently poor behavior despite all the warnings they were given about it.\n\nEven if shouting at the screen isn't an option (which depending on where one actually lives may not be) there's still stuff like punching/screaming into a pillow, squeezing a stress ball or even punching on a punching bag and stuff like that.\n\n> I have a lot of money invested but I can't trust that I will get to keep all my champs and skins so I am wallet shy with Riot now. \n\nI personally haven't bought any gift cards myself in years. Between Riot's decision to remove Dominion and now Twisted Treeline (which I still don't fully buy their reasonings for doing so) as well as the Hextech Crafting feature I haven't really had a reason to get another one.\n \n> I mean, I have a valid point here, because I know I am not that bad compared to some of the shit birds that play this game, I am just out spoken and make those technical chat mistakes, but I am not a huge jerk.\n\nConsistently plays a role, and like most companies while one or two slip ups here and there are usually excusable it's when it becomes a recurring theme that it's a problem. You can give all the warnings and mild punishments you want but if they're still acting up despite it all then it's usually best to just cut your losses with them and remove them for good.\n \n> This brings me into the next part of the issue, and that is the low ELO toxicity. \n> \n> Why is the low elo full of shit birds, but the higher elos aren't? \n> Its a known thing.

Mind providing a source for that info?\n \n> But if you are \"good\" and do what Riot says, then you can advance in rank, because you'll be carried by nice player with honor points....\n> \n> This system seems very unfair to me. \n> \n> It is one thing for the game to have bans and punishments for being a dick, but a whole other to keep players down by grouping them into a bronze prison they will never escape.\n\nI don't play ranked (never have) but from what I understand if a player is stuck at X rank then it's usually because that's where their actual skill level is at. Obviously some other factors can contribute to being there but usually it's their overall skill level that's a major determining factor.","replies":[{"poster":"DBS Ronovon","date":"2019-09-01T20:00:59.779+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"The raging thing hasn't happened so far, in over a year for me.

I still haven't bought anything though, but that new God King Garen skin makes me want to buy it, it looks amazing. \n\nSo, about the whole honor level thing, I found that I would be placed with people who also had no honor quite often, which led me to believe the honor system was a way to hold down mean or toxic players. Futhernore, after playing 1 promo game it placed me in Iron rank, then after winning about half of them I was placed in Bronze 4. \n\nI guess my last rank was Bronze when I left the game, because I was totally tilted out of my mind and hated Riot at the time.

I found a better way to play and control the nerd rage. \n\nSince I cannot convince anyone at Riot to listen to me, and implement a fine system in place of perma bans, I think I will just play it safe and try to advise other players on how to stay out of the penalty box, and not give up all their chances to keep their account.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
