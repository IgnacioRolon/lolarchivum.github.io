After the game it said that i got demoted to dia 5. How is this possible yester day I had 2 promos to dia 3 both failed, and now i get demoted with 17lp. I have never lost a game in dia 4 with 0lp so this either is a bug or idk.\r\nSomeone pls explain.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-22T23:02:12.456+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry to hear about the leaver in that match.  :/  I looked into this for you to see what happened exactly, and it just looks like a bad streak.  Upon reaching 0 LP, matchmaking demoted you down a division.  Getting a demotion sucks, but nothing really seems out of the ordinary here.  More info can also be found through our [Ranked Play FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204010760-Ranked-Play-FAQ).

He never saw his account drop to 0 lp.  In other words, he went from 17lp to demotion.  Not from 0lp to demotion.  To verify, even your FAQ specifies you have to play a game at 0lp to be demoted, even just one game:\n\n\"Demotion occurs if you lose enough matches at 0 LP in a division or tier.\"","replies":[{"poster":"Baron Von Bangin","date":"2017-04-23T18:17:39.133+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think Porocles was saying he was at 17lp at the start of the match, but losing that match dropped MaxILok to 0lp and that's what triggered the demotion. \n\nAm I interpreting that wrong?","replies":[{"poster":"MaxIlok","date":"2017-04-23T18:55:34.659+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was at 17lp and in 1 single game went from 17lp to d5 75lp.

The 0lp shield doesnt count then?","replies":[]}]}]}
