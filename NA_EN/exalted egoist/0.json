I've also of course have been trying to run it as admin. Furthermore, I have checked both java and flash player - both are up to date.\nDoes anyone else have this issue, a solution or suggestion? Any and all help will be greatly appreciated.\nThanks for your time :)","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-14T04:40:46.583+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This often happens if your connection drops off before reaching the login servers.
