Anyway I read some stuff watched some stuff and rito seems to wanna improve support and a great idea came up about what to do with sightstone. Should it be an automatic buy? I do believe it should be however I believe it should be viable in other lanes and have an idea as to how. In support I actually enjoy the ordeal of vision control and knowing what&#039;s happening and that I was the the reason we could steal baron or dragon or see lee coming in for a gank. The same way a support feels great for peeling and making that clutch save. The subject of sightstone is trading utility and a little health  for a &quot;laners&quot; item or an item that compliments your character or playstyle. I feel that the idea riot had for the gold income with sightstone was a great idea however they just added utility to more utility and a nudge towards scaling. Why don&#039;t they make a variant of sightstone but with scaling for supports? (Obviously with not as much scaling as another item for the final version) Think of the jungle enchantments but on a sightstone. I&#039;m not certain as to ratios or numbers but as a general idea they could be something like:\r\n sightstone+null mantle+cloth+??= emerald sightstone gives ?? Armor ?? MR give ???? Health (more then 800) \r\nSapphire sightstone=sightstone+ some ap item gives ???? Health ?? Ap ?? Other (CDR move speed something)\r\nRuby sightstone= sightstone+ad+?? Gives ???? Health ?? Ad ?? (Lethality attack speed or other etc.)\r\nNot only would this offer scaling paths for sightstone it would encourage others to take sightstone in lane so it isn&#039;t only the supports &quot;job&quot; to ward but as a trade off laners would have less stats then they would an item of the same cost of the appropriate correspondance. Would love your guys feedback on this.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-11-23T00:17:09.177+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is why the hybrid sightstone items exist already.","replies":[{"poster":"sharkrat","date":"2016-11-23T09:51:42.206+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes but as i stated the hybrid items take away the best part of your support item the actives and it combines a form of utility with another form of utility to offer extremely little to no scaling as i stated. However these new items would be on par with the finalized support income items but as a sightstone enhancement. That way the support items both income and sightstone can scale in favor of your champ or playstyle rather then put your two support items into a very inefficient item that simply frees up a spot.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Escheton","date":"2016-11-23T09:54:06.914+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The ruby sightstone is already viable elsewhere.

I mean akali and kat in the past have built it and they typically have very little to no health items. I just thought it would make other laners take a look twice if they aren't say akali lee sin kat or those you do see build it for their kits purpose. Maybe top laners will start to pick up the tank version to help with tops vision control while only sacrificing a little more  then the sunfire or zzrot or whatever they were building. I know I'd certainly build it on mid TF if there was an ap version because i almost always had wards on both sides in season 5 and 6","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"khorney","date":"2016-11-22T23:45:12.686+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"you cant imrprove supp its boring and useless.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-11-23T00:18:13.325+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"IE, you suck at it, therefor it is useless and boring. \nJust like in every MMO and other strategy games, it is by far the most complex role that is least obviously rewarding (to little cod kids that only care about K/D).","replies":[{"poster":"ChaosReignsDown","date":"2016-11-23T12:36:16.186+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MagicFlyingLlama,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=lOEeXxwf,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2016-11-23T00:18:13.325+0000)\n>\n> IE, you suck at it, therefor it is useless and boring. \n> Just like in every MMO and other strategy games, it is by far the most complex role that is least obviously rewarding (to little cod kids that only care about K/D).\n\nThank you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"khorney","date":"2016-11-23T00:20:47.935+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"umm seeeing i dont .... its hard to win when i give mid and adc several kills easch and i lose . and its boring because thats all i get off of bot and fill and jungle and fill...... 989% of my games in season 6 were supp.........","replies":[{"poster":"sharkrat","date":"2016-11-23T09:47:38.735+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you dont suck at it try someone designed to keep the feeders alive like taric or thresh with bond of stone.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"sharkrat","date":"2016-11-23T09:46:33.176+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not useless because of the utility and extra damage or tankyness they provide and alot of playmaking supports are very similar to mechanically skill inclined champions like yasuo and zed.
