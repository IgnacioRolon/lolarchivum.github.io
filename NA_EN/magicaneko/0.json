Ik the username and the summoner name are different, but ive tried both my original username and the new summoner name just incase. I then tried the forgot password steps, but the email never sent out, and ive tried at first; again and again after every half hour to hour. i made a ticket but it wanted me to be logged in/out(it wouldnt let me make a ticket without logging in but then it asked me to log out when i made that specific ticket???) i've received the email in regards to it, but i hav no idea how to check the ticket, bc when i click on the link or go on this account and check my tickets it claims the link doesnt exist and this account has no tickets. Just incase i had a friend make a ticket for me as well, informing the situation was for me and how to contact me. I'm so very confused and just wanted to play... :(","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-18T20:24:45.984+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry about all that confusion. The agents in your ticket asked you to log out so that they could proceed with the account recovery since it looks like someone might have hacked and changed the info on it. Go ahead and just reply to the email you had about your ticket in your actual email inbox, and you should be able to talk to them that way.","replies":[]}]}
