When using the practice tool, my ping in-game is perfectly fine. This is when I'm using it alone.\r\nWhen I begin a normal/ranked game, however, my ping will spike to over 300-400, making the game unplayable and forcing me to DC. \r\nI've done everything i know to fix this issue, even calling my internet provider (nothing seems wrong on that end)\r\nI'm wondering if this is a patch issue or game issue, because i have no clue what else it could be.","replies":[{"poster":"lmakehersquirtle","date":"2017-10-20T01:43:01.689+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I also have been having the same issue.

I am putting my money on the \"Rare Bug\" and saying it is the patch or server causing the connection problem.\n\nI also noticed that threw all the other posts with the same problem from the current patch, it is not just located in the NA server but also in EUW as well, so it seems a bit more people are sharing the problem over the world to be common coincidence.\n\nBut yeah if you manage to figure it out, do pass on the knowledge ive been having the problem for more the a week now its rough when its the first time you have the problem since you had your ISP for a year.","replies":[]}]}
