What that sounds like to people like me is \"beat your head against this wall long enough and you won't feel the pain any more.\" No thanks.\n\nThis is a game ... so in that sense, RANKED is strictly fun mode.

It's where you try to win but you can try out non-meta champs, new strategies, different build paths, etc.\n\nARAM is just a brawl. It's pure fun mode where you try to get pentas and stuff.

You can actually have fun even if you suck without people raging. In other modes, people have this bizarre belief that the outcome matters (Btw, it doesn't. It's a game. Grow up people.) In ARAM, you can (usually) get a decent group of relatively mature teammates who are actually there to have fun, not get pissy the moment a matchup with completely random players doesn't end perfectly for their team and terribly for the other.\n\nIf you think you should only get to play champs you've bought (under some weird assumption that the set of champs you've bought is equivalent to the ones you're good at, which isn't even true for 99% of players) then you've completely missed the meaning of All RANDOM, All Mid. It's about the surprise, not the \"do what you do in every single other game all the time.\" In fact, I'm more interested in the exact opposite idea some people have proposed: make all champions available in ARAM, not just the ones you've bought and f2p.\n\nWhat you're asking for is basically another game mode.
