He either moves: toward the target until he is right next to them; away from the target until he is unable to attack; or in a random direction. This issue begins when the sand soldier spawns and continues until the sand soldier expires. \r\nThe issue appears tied to a specific sand soldier as when two are spawned, with the first one being bugged, the issue only occurs when a target is attacked with a bugged sand soldier, even if an unbugged soldier is attacking at the same time.\r\n\r\nThis issue has occured in co-op vs AI and custom games modes.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-03-17T19:49:46.951+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey python 159! \n\nThanks for the report! \n\nWe're aware of a lingering bug where Azir can start automatically moving after issuing soldier attack commands. However, because movement is canceled by other inputs and Azir is a high-input champion, we feel it didn't warrant leaving Azir disabled. It'll be fixed next patch!","replies":[{"poster":"Moneymonster7","date":"2016-03-17T22:22:08.924+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't know how much information you guys have on this, but here is a link to my thread on this bug that I made previously.

And I'm saying this 9 hours after playing him, and I'm still struggling to resist uninstalling the game because I literally CRIED over it.","replies":[]}]}]}
