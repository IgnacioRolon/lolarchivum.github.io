It helps immobile champions _much_ more.\n\n> Active that is extremely short ranged.\n> \n> And you really are comparing a small slow to ranged AAs? Seriously?\n\nNo, it has 550 range — the same as most marksman autoattacks. It serves as a gap closer (not strictly \"mobility\" in the general sense) and decent upfront burst. Or did you forget it also chunks their health and heals the user?\n\n\n> The champions that actually buy [Athene's] extremely often need another mana item to be able to have &#x27;&#x27;unlimited mana&#x27;&#x27;.\n> \n> Specially since it scales with maximum mana.\n\nWhat's your point? Mages are supposed to build at least some flat mana anyway. And you don't have to be able to spam every single spell as soon as it's off cooldown. As long as every single time you actually want to cast a spell, you have the mana for it and don't have to worry about not having it later, that is functionally unlimited mana. Athene's currently provides that on its own (depending in part on level). Unless you're spending 100 mana to kill a minion, it gives you unlimited mana. Or you're Sona or Nami, and your team won't stop tanking damage for no reason. -sigh-\n\n> No, it doesnt. It doesnt fit, because the only champions that bother to buy Athenes are the ones designed to spend mana like crazy.

Which is often ridiculous and untrue.\n> {{champion:134}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:61}} {{champion:115}} and more just get rekt by the changes.\n\nNew Morellonomicon gives 400 mana. For Syndra at level 9 (when she finally gets a passive...UGH, she needs work), that's around 3 minutes (175.4s) of base regen, or 1.5 (87.8s) with current Morellonomicon. Current Athene's makes it around a minute, maybe a bit more if you keep your mana pool full. That's Athene's alone. One minute. If you're spending 400 mana every 20 seconds...stop spamming. You don't need to Q that minion unless you're about to B anyway.\n\nAs for high-cadence casters getting rekt by the changes, have you _seen_ the new Catalyst and Tear? Midrange mages like Ori who are exposed to damage should get a lot of mileage out of the Eternity passive (especially given that Ori and Karma have shields), and longer-range ones have their mana pool effectively increased by 1/3 with Tear (3/4 cost = 4/3 resources). Not to mention Karma and Ori being able to actually heal allies (utility always comes at a cost, of course). The Morellonomicon changes mean mages have access to large mana pools without giving up CDR in the early-mid game. And let me remind you that 500 bonus mana (Dark Seal + Morello's) on a mid-level Syndra makes her pool large enough for ten Qs, four Ws, two Es, and an R with _no regeneration._ Tear into Abyssal gives even more than that. Mages will be fine. The sky is not falling.\n\n> And while Gage/Maw have CDs they are often shorter that the cds of MANY ults, which are more that enough to incapacite any mage that cant buy CDR or has a high CD cooldown ult.\n\nSo don't use your blasted ult while the anti-burst items are off cooldown! You don't get to complain if you just let a Maw eat your ult every time. Just..._don't!_ Besides, with the coming changes, _every_ mage can buy CDR. Maw has a 90-second cooldown, which is actually longer than a lot of ults, especially at rank 2+ and/or with a little CDR. Sterak's Gage has a 45-second cooldown, but it only triggers if they have enough health left to lose when you start your combo. Chip off about 25% of a Gage-wielding ADC's max health, and it becomes irrelevant. The problem happens when you assume you should be able to 100-0 burst an ADC just because they're on your screen and you're a mage who's relatively even on gold and levels. That's not how the game is tuned, and if you try, you're going to regret it.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Biff Manly","date":"2016-04-15T01:18:33.327+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"Yeah, imagine if Galio or Annie had some form of mobility {{summoner:4}} so they could nuke your entire team with their ult.

Over 40+ games in your match history I looked at and not one game on either team did an adc have a maw and a steraks, and a very low number (5ish) did I see a maw/hexdrinker bought.\n\nIn reality if you're an adc you are trying to get your core 2 items quickly before you can buy any situational  items or your damage will be gutted. You'll be flashed on, ignited, ganked by that underfed or fed assassin (doesn't matter, if they lost lane they'll use their faceroll damage to try and make up for it by getting fed off you, or if they won lane they'll go for you anyway to get more fed), and ulted/all inned by everybody the second you show your face anywhere.\n\nIf you dare buy maw/steraks before you manage to get your two items their \"tank\" (anybody abusing that tank dlc pack {{item:3068}} {{item:3025}} ) will be impossible to kill, and they'll sit on you and kill you easily anyway. If they are an actual tank then they will towerdive you easily and be completely immortal because you bought defensive instead of buying {{item:3036}} that you need to effectively kill them.\n\nThat's the actual life of an adc, stop acting like all adcs are graves or quinn, because they aren't. Most games I win as adc are by trying to not die to this stack of b.s. so I can be there to take towers rather than running and gunning invincible with supposedly easy to get items out of nowhere.\n\n\n Adcs have the items they need for situations, and I'm not saying they need buffs because they are needed so much to take towers/force end games but holy shit these items they need aren't as easy to get as you think they are, and you haven't even had adcs get these items in your games anyway so what the actual fuck are you talking about?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Only Play Darius","date":"2016-04-14T18:48:26.828+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Hell the same could be said for actual assassins too.\n\nYou think Yi/Fiora/Ekko are building tank items because they want to?","replies":[{"poster":"ProfDrDeath","date":"2016-04-14T19:39:53.849+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Of the three, only Ekko is a dedicated assassin - Yi and Fiora are fighters who need to stay in the fight for full effectiveness instead of going in,  unloading and going out.\n\nAnd even Ekko's kit is more suited towards longer-term combat patterns, between his 3-hit passive, his delayed Q return, his W passive and his low CD, low damage abilities.","replies":[{"poster":"Only Play Darius","date":"2016-04-14T20:04:00.446+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yi is listed as an assassin first, just he isnt really played as one.
