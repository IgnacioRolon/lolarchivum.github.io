Blind Draft is a joke that only makes sense for your first couple of weeks of LoL. Normal Draft is a (staggering) nightmare of missed ready checks, disintegrating lobbies, and power tantrums over champion and lane selection. At least if you queue for Ranked, you actually get to play LoL while you're young enough to still remember how keyboards work. Which is why so many of us casuals are now cluttering up the Ranked lanes.\n\nGet Riot to stop acting like Ranked is the only game mode that matters, or will ever matter, and I bet things go back to the way they were a few years ago, when casual people mostly played on one field, and the serious folks mostly played on the other.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zen Ineth","date":"2016-12-27T21:04:21.075+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You know, this happens in every season.\n\nEvery.
