Now this was sort of a negative thing about league but it showed the general hype when a new champion was released that everyone wanted to play them. now a days no one fucking plays new champions. honestly i'v seen an {{champion:427}}  in game twice, {{champion:240}}  I played him once and have only seen him maybe 30-40 times since his release most of them being played by my friend. \r\nSo I come here with a question. Why does no one play new champions any more? my personal thoughts are because all of the new champions so far have been goofy, except for {{champion:202}} very serious and cool champion( super high play rate), {{champion:136}} high play rate when released very cool champion. {{champion:163}} I can't quite remember but she had a moderate play rate I believe. I honestly think people are more appealed to play a champion due to their cool factor and not just their strength alone. Look at zed for example pretty nerfed still sitting at an 8% play rate. \r\nThoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"Bandle City","date":"2016-10-20T20:03:23.811+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As far as Ivern, I feel quite strongly that this is just a recurrence of the whole Bard release scenario. No on knows how to play him correctly yet and those that do are constantly dealing with teams who don't know how to play with an Ivern on their team. Because of this most people either assume that he sucks or just don't want to deal with a team who can't take advantage of what he does and so people just don't play him. \n\nAs far as Kled goes though I'm not too positive but I think it's more or less that he just doesn't fit the meta as much as other top laners do right now and the same goes for in the jungle. That and every time I've played him my team never takes advantage of my ult which just makes him too frustrating to play. There are some people who main him entirely though and those Kled players are freaking scary if you ever watch any videos or streams of them. lol XD","replies":[{"poster":"reaperteaser","date":"2016-10-20T20:37:41.343+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"people still dont know to click the lantern","replies":[{"poster":"Bandle City","date":"2016-10-20T20:45:03.613+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know, right?

Combined with the fact that new champions have a ramp up time, that means that, after the initial hype wears off, most of them are going to seem super weak for the majority of the player base. \n\nAurelion Sol's playstyle is incredibly different from every other champion I've ever played; I have to have precise champion movement, but my eyes have to be watching 600 units away from where I'm standing, and I have to be able to pivot on a dime to make sure all my orbs hit. I love him, but I suck with him, and so do most people that I've met.\n\nBut when champs have pretty high learning curves, that means more advanced players (such as Riot's balance target of high Plat - low Diamond, as well as their interest in balancing pro play) will be much more skilled with them. That means that they're going to be fairly weak for the other 95% of the player base.\n\nCool factor is certainly important. Even when Urgot had a very high win rate (years ago...), his play rate was never *that* high. Certainly nothing like the consistent 15-20% (or higher) Lee Sin and Thresh have had, even when their win rates were close to 46%.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vistha Kai","date":"2016-10-20T20:16:41.283+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">{{champion:240}}  I played him once and have only seen him maybe **30-40** times since his release\n\nWow.\nI've seen him literally once.\n\n>{{champion:136}} high play rate when released very cool champion. \n\nDurning the first two weeks, then nobody played him.\n\n>Thoughts?\n\nPassives within passives and overly complicated gimmicks otherwise, plus overnerfing.\n\nSome would vouch for, say, Aurelion Sol being \"the most broken champion in the game\" _(The same guy who believes Yasuo's only weakness is that the person playing him.

A lot of people just assume the new champ will be op and if it's not, they drop it.\n\nEkko's release is an example of how much a new champ gets played if they're simply overpowered.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Handy Sandy ","date":"2016-10-20T19:59:03.244+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because everyone wants to stick with the OP/meta picks. \n\nIf you play something like {{champion:110}} mid and you lose your lane it's gotta be because you didn't pick something a lot of people do and not because the other person was better than you which surprisingly I hear people say in a lot of my games.","replies":[]}]}
