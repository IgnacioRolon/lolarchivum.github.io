Obviously the afk person would still get no credit for playing the game unless they came back within a few minutes of the \"bot\" having to play for them.","replies":[{"poster":"Faie","date":"2016-12-30T23:39:28.093+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Absolutely not.

I mean if you can't deal with enemy team 4v4 or 4v3, then you already lost regardless of if the afk sits in base or goes to lane and feeds 1v1.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2016-12-30T23:27:13.967+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Idk, if i seen a bot, i'd snowball off of it so hard.","replies":[{"poster":"FioraWillCarry","date":"2016-12-30T23:36:18.226+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=A Bloo Banana,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=WX0t6eFe,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2016-12-30T23:27:13.967+0000)\n>\n> Idk, if i seen a bot, i&#x27;d snowball off of it so hard.\n\nIntermediate bots could work.
