Miss Fortune is SUPER bad in this meta vs tanks since her sustained damage is total shit. Lucian has been gutted for bot lane to where if you don't snowball the game to shit you are gonna get outscaled and FAST. if you go crit on lucian(so you still scale) you just aren't strong enough early to bully hard enough. lucian has been gutted for bot lane. \n\nIt doesn't help that cc supports just aren't very good right now compared to ardent supps since cc supports can't proc ardent. once ardent is nerfed you can safely pick a champ like thresh/blitz to counter these passive supports without fearing that if you fail to kill them you will be massively outscaled.\n\n\nJhin, Lucian, MF, Draven, and Caitlyn are pretty much the premier lane bullies for the majority of the player base (throw in Kalista at very high elo) but you don't see them nearly as much as you see Kog, Twitch, Xayah, Trist right now. and thats because the scaling hyper carries have no problem surviving lane right now. It doesn't feel risky to pick any of those but maybe twitch. but even twitch can just give up the cs knowing his support can baby sit him later with ardent. \n\n\nI really can't wait for the new runes. some of these runes are super aggressive early and lane bullies have options once the rune system comes out. Some of them synergize really well with bullies and even though lethal tempo is definitely busted, it's not going to be as good in lane as press the attack. Hopefully lane bullies do their job then.\n\n\nBut either way, Twitch needs to be looked at for a mini rework since his kit is SUPER unhealthy.","replies":[{"poster":"Hèntaî ","date":"2017-10-08T00:02:30.204+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> It doesn't help that cc supports just aren't very good right now compared to ardent supps since cc supports can't proc ardent. \n\n{{champion:89}} with stoneborn and {{item:3504}}  is nasty","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Juicy Ðoge","date":"2017-10-24T01:44:08.633+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Twitch jungle is the real problem.

In most fights it's you and your team's fault for not having the right champion to push him out of the fight or hard engage on him.\n\nAlso for you support bros and sisters if you have allies who dash in like nocturne, diana, lee sin, riven, fizz, malphite, please keep in mind of the other enemy players, like prevent them from getting to their twitch this is why when I play support I mostly play alistar the most because he is so insanely tanky, he heals per enemy kill/assist, he actually has good burst for a tank support, he can cleanse out of any cc so veigar wall is nothing or cc out of stun from blitz/thresh hooks (but you still get pulled but you can still attack em), He can push any one out of a team fight making them unable to get to anyone, Also when you get eye of the equinox {{item:2303}} locket {{item:3190}} Ninja tabi {{item:3047}} You can just buy a Ardent Censer on alistar which is absolute BS to the enemy team.\nIn a bunch of my ranked games even ones we got wrecked in lane I came back with ardent censer and the enemy team wasn't aware that everytime someone got killed my team got healed and got the ardent buff so its a scumbag trick you can use on alistar right now.\n\nAlot of people I see who play or think of Alistar never think of maxing the W first when you should because it has good knock back range, his W got buffed for the WQ combo is easier to perform even if you suck, it's also got a shorter cooldown than his Q.\n\nI've recently started playing ranked flex where you get alot of good players and done soloQ ranked where there are worser players.\n\nFlex is harder because everyone knows what to do most of the time while as in soloQ most people get easily angry and will just have no idea how to solve a situation.\n\nAgain I know this is going to be hard to believe and people will downvote this because they think Twitch is god tier and not many people think of ways to get around it but trust me this works also you need to keep in mind that alot of people aren't really good at keeping their cool so if they see a champion having a high win rate and they panic over a champion who just auto attacks then it shows that people are too lazy to think and act on a stragety to stop em and this is a team game and alot of people do hate others in a competitive game.\n\nAlso please tell your team in the game lobby to beware of twitch's engage and be prepared to deal with it.\n\nToo me in league I don't find most champions to be broken except Veigar because if you get cc'd by anyone or himself and you have no clease or unable to get to him to shut him down then you will easily die it doesn't matter if you have 10million warmogs stuffed in your tanky ass you're good as dead.\n\nEveryone else it does come down to that player's skill even high elo players do bad in some games, there are alot of normal and bad lee sin players but there are a small percent of really really good lee sin players (im talking about him as an example) who can predict your jungle position, they can predict player positions before they even show up in vision. that may sound wierd to you but there is a difference between a champion being broken and just you being unable to stop them.\n\nJust git gud and adapt, heck i bitched about veigar so maybe i should git gud against him XD.\n\nOkay now time to raise my anti flame shield to protect myself from the harsh comments and downvotes im going to receive now.\n\n{{sticker:sg-soraka}} Be nice to me pls
