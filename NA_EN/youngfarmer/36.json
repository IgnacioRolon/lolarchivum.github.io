It's still OK for a champion to be broken then even though you both have the same knowledge of the game, you will say with certainty that it's OK for Irelia to be unbalanced simply because the other play may have more experience on a worse champion? I like playing my favorite champions as much as the next guy, but if its a decision between trying to have fun and winning then of course I won't pick some trash champion even if i like them in RANKED.

It is UNFAIR for a champion to be broken like the state that Irelia, Jhin, or Akali are in. You can play well against that champion and beat them, it doesn't change the fact that they are unbalanced.

Since in D+ the match ups and champion knowledge is pretty common, so the only advantage you have is that you played your champion more. Meanwhile their champ can just build up leads and get other advantages on the map because your champ isn't broken.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"10 fps","date":"2018-09-24T22:19:10.377+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is a guy who got challenger by playing Kayle and Jax only.

Its EXTREMELY hard to lose a game if you have them on your team and manage to get them to mid/late at which point they will steamroll through the enemy team one by one. These are basically the DOTA equivalents of hard-rice carries like Anti-Mage,Spectre,Terrorblade PA ect. If you get them to late there is a 90% chance you auto-win UNLESS the enemy team has somebody else on this list to match them. Otherwise the power difference between teams is too massive.\n\nBOTTOM: {{champion:145}} This is not a champion. This is... an abomination.\n {{champion:51}} hard wins lane and hard wins game. \n\nSUPP: {{champion:555}} why play any other Hook support? both Blitz and Thresh have basically been retired by this guy. {{champion:12}}  still one of the best damn tank supports in the game. does decent damage, has great CC and initiation power. realisticallythe tankiest support in the game.\n\nJUNGLE: {{champion:104}}  another 1v3 champ completely immune to the gaze of the balance team for some reason. I guess they feel like whatever champ would fill the void next would be more oppressive or something but eh? (like kha'zix)\n{{champion:11}}  We all know what he is capable of. If you let him finish Rageblade and dont have the CC to lock him down its over. experiences with this champ highly varies on elo but rest assured he is built to hyper-carry.\n\nSPECIAL SHOUTOUTS:\n\n{{champion:84}} <-- dumpsters basically every single melee match up with Q spam and stealth. AUTOWINS all other lane matchups 9/10 times by simply hitting 6 because Execute damage is ridiculous on top of Ignite/Electro nonsense + 3 gap closers\n\n{{champion:7}}  <-- wont really \"carry\" you a game per-say but is more or less a more straight forward X2 more effective braindead version of Ahri. Why pick any other AP assassin mid?\n\n{{champion:86}} also dumpsters a lot of top match ups. Even if you beat him he still wins because of Villain system. so much stats has been dumped into him playing with a brain is completely optional. Incredibly unfun to play against and feels 50/50 even into what used to be his WORSE hard counter matchups like {{champion:114}} or {{champion:122}}. fuck statsticks.
