Cause only after the turrets start falling is when the lanes start breaking up, and the team starts contesting objectives as a unit. Mainly because SR isn't a kill focused game mode, so it becomes stagnent if players arn't able to capitalize off of their opponent's mistakes.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Ariel the Cruel","date":"2016-12-28T00:30:54.326+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:133}} {{summoner:6}} {{summoner:12}} \n{{champion:223}}  {{summoner:6}} {{summoner:12}} \n\nNew bot lane meta.","replies":[{"poster":"KoKoboto","date":"2016-12-28T00:50:10.502+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Lmao I play Quinn bot lane and I rarely get ganked because I'm usually up top or mid and I let my support take farm.","replies":[{"poster":"Stormshadow3503","date":"2016-12-28T01:41:26.636+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Supports can't farm fast.
