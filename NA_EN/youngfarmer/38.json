They also don't have the patience to watch and control their positioning for extra peroids of time. They rather just click cast nukes.\n\nAS does have pretty solid dmg pre 6 though. And later game. The way he works though he feels kinda just like he adds more to a controlling team.\n\nI think part of it too is this champion is advertised to fly. But the first rank of his E kinda feels disappointing. But it has to be to control his ability to reset in lane early game. What I would do is invest an extra point into E middle game before maxing Q. You won't really miss the 70 Q dmg and 0.2 stun as rylias and his stars give him plenty of control/dmg. You're just giving up 35 dmg on Q for a 33% increase of range of his fly zone. Then you actually see the option to engage with a giant star more often.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AwesomeChad","date":"2016-07-31T20:30:15.546+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"his kit is poorly designed for the purpose of balancing.

That is his utter crippling weakness to melee attackers. No other champion has such a weakness; every champion can utilize the rest of their kit to either damage down enemies, CC them, or at least speed themselves away. Aurelion, due to how his kit works, can't really do any of those and has to waste his ultimate or his flash to remove himself from guaranteed death, and neither of those options is favorable to people playing him. \n\nAdditionally, his kit is too passive. It's a massive waiting game for the stars to rotate and kill someone, and for that reason, people prefer other champs. It's a shame too, considering his personality is so much fun.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ProfDrDeath","date":"2016-07-31T21:19:40.666+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://champion.gg/champion/AurelionSol/Middle\n\nThe reason for the low play rate is his high price, combined with his steep learning curve. However, once a player has his mechanics and playstyle down, he is powerful like few others (around 65% winrate for experienced players).","replies":[]},{"poster":"NicolasTr","date":"2016-07-31T21:16:40.474+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"His kit is counter intuitive. He have short ranged spell and a lock down on his Q and his passive doesnt work on melee range, but he is suppose to be fine in melee range ... Remove the lock on his Q or reduce it at least and make it possible to reduce his passive size on W with faster rotations because shorter range arround Sol and he would be perfect.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ZT Xperimentor","date":"2016-07-31T21:06:51.766+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"More like he's inadvertently countered by several popular champions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"YJRBqwXJcS","date":"2016-07-31T21:04:23.112+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"his q is trash","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ast√¥lfo","date":"2016-07-31T21:00:09.335+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Uh no, he's perfectly fine.\nHe's just very hard to play, and most people don't want to learn how to play with his passive.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tobias Brackner","date":"2016-07-31T20:58:15.569+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"His kit's fine.

Adjusting the radius of the orbit on the fly was for me very instrumental to the feel of the champ.\nI'd really prefer the W getting less cd again, but therefor applying rylais as dot(20%) rather than aoe(40%), as the 40% perma slow really is opressive to face and maybe takeing a bit damage of from either the passive or his Q if needed.\nBut the W cd for me just destryed the flow of the champ abd nade him feel really clunky together with how his Q works, though if the Q was working as selfpeel, he would need a MASSIVE compensation nerf, as it would be a night mare for melees to face him past rylais. \n\nAlso, a mostly positioning based playstyle that also puts focus on macro and teamplay rarly is very appealing for the usual lol player, and imo that's fine, not every champ has to be an overloaded multi dash high damage champ like yasuo or lee, which both regardless of performance are rather popular.\nSo i wouldn't neccesarily say his kit isn't right, not from a plying as perspective. It IS really tough to balance though, especially with the stupid rylais it can get opressive really fast.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DropFill","date":"2016-07-31T20:26:49.414+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"His kit has no problems at all.
