If you are higher than you belong, it should be hard to climb.\n\nThe system wants you to prove that you belong where you are first and you do that by winning more than you lose and over time it'll gradually equalize and eventually spike up.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jubbinaut","date":"2015-03-21T08:06:44.091+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not necessarily. MMR gains/losses are stable - you gain the same amount from a win as you lose from a loss.\n\nSo as long as you're winning more than you're losing, your MMR will increase. As your MMR increases, your LP gain/loss will stabilize. Should you increase your MMR *enough*, you'll start to see yourself gaining more LP than you're losing.","replies":[{"poster":"SpongebobIsLife","date":"2015-03-21T13:06:39.813+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is flawed. My d5 friend won 7 games in a row for 5-7 lp each, lost one and he lost 33 lp.

It is hard to climb once you get behind. But it's also hard to get significantly behind.\n\nConsider: Your friend is *placed* in d5, but his MMR isn't at a d5 level. With a differential that high (win 5, lose 30), it's pretty significantly lower. With an MMR significantly below is ranking, it really *shouldn't* be easy for him to climb. After all, the goal is to keep the rank in tune with the hidden MMR.\n\nIf the system were more precise, your friend wouldn't be d5 at all - as it stands, it's simply trying to correct for a perceived mis-placement. Once it's corrected (either his rank drops to roughly where his MMR is, or his MMR raises to roughly where he's ranked), that LP gain/loss will stabilize.\n\nIt's not a perfect system, by any means, but it *is* effective.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"IcyPepper","date":"2015-03-21T08:19:57.845+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Adding to that logic, it prevents winning streaks to take you too far ahead. Once you hit opponents with a much higher mmr than you and you lose, the system lowers your LP a bit so you can handle opponents again. Rinse, wash, repeat until you meet those opponents, with their mmr, and the odds are much more fair.\n\nIt *is* frustrating, but it makes sense.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"EL HAMSTERO","date":"2015-03-21T07:45:59.788+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah it takes forever to change your mmr.  it can be very frustrating","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"DustyBronco","date":"2015-03-21T16:09:41.012+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree.
