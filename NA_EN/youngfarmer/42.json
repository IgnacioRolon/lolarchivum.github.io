A new player can be expected to on average fall into the bottom 30% of players.\n\nGonna have to call you out on an aspect of your first point, sorry.\nPlayers will hit level thirty with half the IP, but they'll have the same amount of Champions as before, and not only that, people might have even more Runes.\nHere's why. First of all, people will still need sixteen Champions to enter ranked. That number hasn't changed, and in fact, it is increasing because of the increasing number of bans. When I hit level thirty, I only had seven Champions. That number would have been lower if I had hit level thirty sooner, but I would have still needed to spend the same amount of time grinding up to the required sixteen Champions.\nSecondly, players could jump into ranked without Tier Three Runes before. They could just hit the required Champion limit and jump into ranked. Since the required Champion limit is still the same (and is going up in the near future), players will still take the same amount of time to get those 16 Champions, and therefore still have the option to jump into Ranked without Tier Three Rune pages.\nThe reason why I say people might have more Runes is because Tier Two Runes were discounted shortly (two months) after the level requirements were changed. People can now easily jump into ranked with full Rune Pages, even though they're not Tier Three. Tier Three Runes don't provide much of an advantage over Tier Two Runes, anyways. Basically, it's easier for people to get the stats they need for ranked while it's still the same difficulty to get Tier Three Runes.","replies":[{"poster":"Fondling Gems","date":"2017-01-15T00:41:33.940+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Really? Only 7 champions at lv 30?  I easily had 13-14 by that point and I just snagged up 2 450 ip Champs to get the 16 champions needed.  I also had a full tier 3 rune page at this point.  I then played like 2 ranked games before realizing I needed to practice more and didn't play ranked for a couple months.\n\nAlso although I didn't make it clear I don't believe owning 16 champions means you play 16 champions or you actually put effort into obtaining 16 champions.  This is due to the existence of 450 ip champions that are very easy to buy to reach 16 champions even if you never plan to play them.  I can personally say I did this. I played Annie, one of my first 16 champions, for the first time last year.  \n\nThe existence of 450 ip champions skews things because I know a ton of people hitting 30 buy them up for ranked because they take 2-4 games to earn.  As such I find players have X number of champions and Y number of fill ins for ranked, where Y is 16-X.  As such most new lv 30 players I meet only have X number of champions they wanted or know how to play, the rest are just for ranked.  450 champions are so cheap in comparison to other champions that they add a flat number of games required after hitting 30 to play ranked.  Changing how quickly one hits 30 changes how many 450 champions they need to buy, but 450 champions are so cheap that it only has a small effect on games needed.\n\nThink of it this way:  Before to hit level 30 I had to play X games, lets say 100 for nice numbers as the actual amount doesn't really matter in this context.  Over that time I got Y ip to spend on champions that I wanted.  Lets call that 20000 ip.  That means I have 20000 ip to spend on champions that I want to learn right?  Well lets just say that gets us 10 champions.  We now need 6 more to play ranked!  Well the cheapest ones are only 200 ip compared to the average 2k ip of the ones I wanted.  Pre 30 I got 200 ip per game with a 2X ip boost.  That means to get 6 champions to play ranked I have to play 12 games.\n\n- In this situation it took the player 112 games to meet ranked requirements. \n\nNew situation, number of games to hit 30 halved.  This means I get to 30 after 50 games and with 10000 ip.  Instead of 10 champions I only got 5.  That means I need 11 champions to play ranked.  1 game still equals 100 ip and the cheapest champions are 200 so I need to play 22 games.\n\n- In this situation it took the player 72 games to meet ranked requirements.  \n\n(Please note that the numbers here are not accurate as they exist to present the math in a simple and easy to comprehend way.  Though actual values differ the results still show that 1/2 ranked time = less ip and less champions.)\n\n--------------------------------------\n\nIt is human nature to want to achieve something as we complete steps towards it.  Getting to lv 30 means we can play ranked: regardless of our number of champions there is a good chance a player will want to try it right away.  They try to play and realize they need 16 champions.  They then take the shortest route towards getting 16 champions even if they aren't going to use the ones they are filling in for ranked.  This means that they would not own or play as many champions as they would if it took longer to hit lv 30.","replies":[{"poster":"Aeszarck","date":"2017-01-15T01:24:54.475+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Fondling Gems,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=aTpbNvVv,comment-id=000200000000000000000000,timestamp=2017-01-15T00:41:33.940+0000)\n>\n> .\n\nThanks for the detailed explanation! Your reasoning makes sense. Now I agree, players will generally try to utilize something that they just unlocked as soon as possible, so they'll generally buy cheaper Champions in order to get to playing Ranked as soon as possible, decreasing the overall experience players get before heading into ranked.\n\nIf you want to know why I had only seven by level thirty, here's a breakdown of my pre-thirty IP purchases.\nBy level 30, I had purchased {{champion:127}} (6300), {{champion:254}} (6300), {{champion:37}} (3150), 9 Greater Seals of Scaling Health (410 x 9 = 3690), 9 Greater Marks of Magic Penetration (410 x 9 = 3690), 9 Greater Glyphs of Scaling Magic Resist (205 x 9 = 1845), 3 Greater Quintessences of Ability Power (1025 x 3 = 3075), 9 Greater Seals of Armor (205 x 9 = 1845), 9 Greater Marks of Attack Damage (205 x 9 = 1845), 9 Greater Glyphs of Cooldown Reduction (820 x 9 = 7380), 3 Greater Quintessences of Attack Speed (1025 x 3 = 3075), and the 2015 MSI Icon (1 IP). \nTogether, this totals 42196 IP.\n\n(The other four Champions I had came from giveaways: {{champion:133}} , {{champion:86}} , {{champion:18}} , and {{champion:12}} .)\n\nAfter I got my last Quintessences, I bought these Champions: {{champion:89}} (4800), {{champion:103}} (4800), {{champion:102}} (3150), {{champion:30}} (3150), {{champion:39}} (4800), {{champion:134}} (6300), {{champion:3}} (4800), {{champion:222}} (6300), and {{champion:6}} (3150). (Around the end before I purchased my final Champion {{champion:6}} , I also purchased a few icons, 2015 Worlds (1 IP), Icy Minion (1500 IP), Snowball Fight (100 IP), Unleashed Penguin (100 IP), Traveler's Penguin (100 IP), and Penguin Toss (100 IP).)\nTogether, these Champions total 41250 IP (43151 with icons), which took quite a while to get. Match History isn't working and neither is the [LoLReader](http://1lann.github.io/lolreader) (I think updating to the new client must have changed my Logs folder to make it unreadable to the tool), so I can't give you the number of wins it took me to finally get Urgot.","replies":[{"poster":"Fondling Gems","date":"2017-01-15T04:23:00.720+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ah, that would do it.

I would have had even less if it weren't for Riot's giveaways.\nI remember my pre-thirty experiences and the order in which I got my Champions pretty well, but the reason why I'm sure of the exact order I got them in is because I scrolled through my Match History a few weeks ago to my first game. Quite nostalgic, and it also allowed me to see the order of my purchased Champions since I'd generally play them shortly after I bought them. You could do that too, if you had the time and something to take notes on. EDIT: [Apparently you did!](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/L9mPocpM-whats-the-dumbest-thing-you-did-when-you-first-started-lol?comment=0062)\n\nAlso, it's funny, I bought a lot of female Champions without even trying to do that. I bought Lissandra because my friend said she was a top tier mage who professionals used, I bought Vi because my friend used her when playing with me, I bought Sona because she was just fun and easy to use, I bought Leona because she was the highest rated support on Twisted Treeline (I wanted to play Twisted Treeline ranked with my friends), I bought Ahri because she was a highly rated middle laner, and so on. I just bought what was strong and/or what seemed fun.\n\nLoLReader was just not working because I had transferred to a new computer and the logs were on the old one, apparently.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"PlanetWarwick","date":"2017-01-14T18:00:49.987+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dude I got b1 first placements then this season I got b4\n First placements will always be nice to you","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lauchmelder","date":"2017-01-14T18:03:23.590+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"He's partially right.

This season I won&#x27;t make the same mistakes, I will be leaving silver behind for good.\n\nlol no.  op champs mean nothing till plat+, just play what you are comfortable with fotm followers dont win in low elo, they dont even know WHY the champs are strong, or how to abuse them.\n\nalso, ahri is and always has been super strong.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Blåbæret","date":"2017-01-14T07:03:28.901+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"I SWEAR, SERIOUSLY.

They won't get as much experience overall but at least they'll have a pool of easy Champions.\n\nAlso, you still never told me the rest of your thoughts on [this](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/aFaWHPZH-real-talk-ryze-will-never-be-balanced-as-long-as-riot-tries-to-preserve-his-identity?comment=000600010000000000000000000000000000).","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"k wìx","date":"2017-01-14T19:34:20.822+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unsolvable problem.
