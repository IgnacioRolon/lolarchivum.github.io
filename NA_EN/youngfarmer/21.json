He takes no punishment in lane, he buys a vamp scepter and that with his Q basically means hes full health all laning faze. If you do manage to get him low he gets free AD for missing health. and then don&#039;t worry even with armour he can face tank 5 turret shots and not die. Sorry most champions can&#039;t take 10 free crits at level 6. All in all fuck trynd poorly designed champion that needs changes bad.","replies":[{"poster":"ZerglingOne","date":"2018-10-26T22:13:42.616+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Man. And I remember when he got 40 AD, 50% crit, and 36% crit damage from his passive and Q.\n\nGood times, good times. Although back then he couldn't be critting you consistently while on high/full HP. He had to get low. So... Yeah. Maybe they need to revert the crit chance to being based off of his missing HP.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LeftyRaydy","date":"2018-10-26T22:13:34.899+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"that is because his right arm is a lot stronger than his left.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FioraMain3","date":"2018-10-26T21:48:04.603+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree. such a stupid retarded fucking dipshit champion. Outlanes any melee ad top laner which i just find fucking ridiculous, scales into late game, a splitpush machine and top of that has a fucking crit multiplier. Just honestly on fucking heroine to make that champion what he is today. and These new runes now make him even more op, on top of that. Such a fucking retarded shitty champion. Tryndamere players don't even have fun because of how broken their champion is.","replies":[]},{"poster":"wishbone25","date":"2017-03-04T05:46:13.619+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"time his ult  is 5 sec GG ez","replies":[]}]}
