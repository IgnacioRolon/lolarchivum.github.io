It feels casual, I don't feel obligated to counterpick my enemies, I don't have to fear being counterpicked (if it happens, I can just say \"well, sometimes it happens that way\" and go on with my life instead of getting angry at my lane opponent for counterpicking me), my Champions will never be banned or simply taken from me by the enemy team, it is quick to get into games, and I can play every role so if someone else calls it/begs for it then I can switch to another role. \nHowever, oddly enough, I have been getting my called role a ton lately. It seems like ~40% of the players in my Blind Pick games are content with filling; they don't call a role and wait until everyone else calls theirs. It's really weird but it makes me really happy because I get my intended role so much.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Darkdemon653","date":"2017-05-13T15:57:14.755+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is only one matchmaking system that all the queues share.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Aeszarck","date":"2017-05-13T15:43:21.283+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did you ask the Lee Sin if he was in a premade?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jebron","date":"2017-05-13T10:10:34.423+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Technically it is fair to the system, because if they have low normal mmr (likely from not playing in the queue) then you are considered to be equal to them skill level wise at least in that queue.\n\nI'm gonna play devils advocate and say that normal mmr is better how it is now than alternative options. You basically want to exclude high elo players from normal games because they're better.\n\nYou see ranked queue times for streamers and high elo players? Go ahead and triple that for normal games if they use their solo queue mmr. \n\n\nTake the opportunity of playing with a much better player to see if you can learn something from them, personally when I play normals I tend to try to help other players correct mistakes or just be friendly with them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Michael702","date":"2017-05-13T05:31:12.703+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"But the MMR...\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"Battlecast Sona","date":"2017-05-13T16:54:34.728+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's likely that the Master Tier player rarely plays normals, and so their MMR in normals is considerably lower than their ranked matchmaking.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ZephyrDrake","date":"2017-05-13T15:52:46.109+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"balanced blind pick matchmaking... i don't think you know what blind pick is about","replies":[]},{"poster":"ShinkoMinori","date":"2017-05-13T04:32:01.877+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":6,"body":"Blind and Draft has the same mmr","replies":[{"poster":"ElfOfTheDesert","date":"2017-05-13T14:10:46.914+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"each Q has it's own MMR.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LunarStrike","date":"2017-05-13T07:11:30.731+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"can u just stop typing. i think i've seen like 7 comments from u so far that make me wanna rip my hair out","replies":[]}]}]}
