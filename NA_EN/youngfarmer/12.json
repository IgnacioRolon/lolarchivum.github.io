It isn't guaranteed to crit on the fifth shot, but it is extremely likely to do so.

That's impossible if you're sitting on a steady gold income. Older dragons made sure that the team who is ahead, stays ahead.

The Water and Wind drakes add more subtle, but just as powerful effects that influence the game in a slower way. \n\nI think that the Infernal and Mountain drakes NEED to have their bonuses modified. If they made Infernal scale in power based on the number of nearby allies, or slowly build to full like the new effect on Liandry, I think this would make it feel on par with Wind and Water. The same goes true with Mountain. I feel like it could use some kind of effect that builds to full potential, instead of always immediately being at full blast. I think something like this would make the RNG of 3 Infernals/Mountains feel just as impactful as the RNG of 3 Wind/Water.","replies":[]}]}
