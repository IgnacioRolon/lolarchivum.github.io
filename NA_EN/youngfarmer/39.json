It's not even a snare, since you can still cast mobility spells like flash and any dash/warp.","replies":[{"poster":"NightKnightSai","date":"2016-04-14T20:15:03.725+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":7,"body":"Seems u are a smartass in school mate lmao","replies":[{"poster":"Axis the Dragon","date":"2016-04-15T04:58:32.529+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, that's just how it works lmao\n\nMultiplicative %'s isn't even something super academic, that shit is basic math bruh","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Evewynn","date":"2016-04-15T01:13:19.990+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think he meant having 2 major slows in his kit, not stacking them to increase the intensity.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Maple Crusader","date":"2016-04-14T19:52:33.567+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gut the Fish!","replies":[{"poster":"YoungFarmer","date":"2016-04-14T19:53:21.660+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=LungDrakkar,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=ZbiYkVUX,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-04-14T19:52:33.567+0000)\n>\n> Gut the Fish!\n\nWould anyone really complain?\n\n**Kappa**\n\nHe just needs a tone down","replies":[{"poster":"Fisherman Fízz","date":"2016-04-14T19:59:19.684+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Senpai Adam,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=ZbiYkVUX,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2016-04-14T19:53:21.660+0000)\n\n> Would anyone really complain?\n> \n\nMaybe","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Fisherman Fízz","date":"2016-04-14T20:01:10.001+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd be ok if they reduced the slow to maybe 30-40% I mean Fizz is a very mobile champion.","replies":[{"poster":"YoungFarmer","date":"2016-04-14T20:02:07.583+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Fisherman Fízz,realm=EUW,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=ZbiYkVUX,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2016-04-14T20:01:10.001+0000)\n>\n> I&#x27;d be ok if they reduced the slow to maybe 30-40% I mean Fizz is a very mobile champion.\n\nLook even a guy named fizz agrees :D","replies":[{"poster":"Fisherman Fízz","date":"2016-04-14T20:04:30.757+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well lets be honest here, with the mobility Fizz has, if I land the ultimate on someone, the target isn't really going anywhere unless he flashes or Qss the ult.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"WinBoat","date":"2016-04-14T19:53:48.611+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Not as worse as a Nasus slow.............
