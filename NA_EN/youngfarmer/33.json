I didn&#039;t  have to pay a dime out of my pocket.\r\nThis past week Riot gave you two free skin shards just for playing league through the quests. \r\nI re rolled those two skin shards plus one I already owned and got arcade ezreal. Riot just gave me $20 worth of content for free. \r\n\r\nJust be grateful you get anything for free.  \r\n\r\nI know the OE changes suck, but still stop being ungrateful.","replies":[]}
