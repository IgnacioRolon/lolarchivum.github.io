Now it at least feels like a build decision. Kinda easy to me: If you are in danger of maxing, forego heavy CDR items like {{item:3071}} {{item:3165}} {{item:3078}} {{item:3025}} {{item:3115}} . Some of those could *maybe* lose some effectiveness, at least setting their primary purpose to being CDR (more akin to Frozen Heart's purpose... I don't think {{item:3071}} {{item:3078}} should be that high, at very least). If you *really* can't find a way to avoid maxing CDR, grab Sorcery as a second tree to get some bite out of the over-balance with Transcendence.\n\nSeparate notes on CDR:\n\nTranscendence needs reworked somehow. It's nice that it's a fully CDR rune, but the two bonuses don't even interact favorably. The 10% CDR is typically used more as a bridge to fill the gap, whereas the AD/AP bonus on overdraw is intended to not only bridge, but exceed your max CDR. Those bonuses should be separate, in my opinion, as they don't tend to work together particularly well, especially since they leave champions reliant on CDR for their builds waiting for any bonus at all until midgame. The inspiration bonus is almost hands-down better, even at such a small chunk, because the bonuses actually work together with CDR dependent champions.\n\nAlso, I feel like Blue Buff could use some endgame love (since it's not even truly that good early, anyways... basically not a kill threat), and boost max CDR on who grabs it, at least by half the bonus. Endless mana is nice, but easy enough to attain regardless, so CDR maxed champs could use a little incentive to prefer it over Red Buff, instead of actually feel bad for soaking up the caster buff with little to gain from it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mos Deadly98","date":"2018-01-05T20:54:46.766+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{item:3056}} you missed this one.
