What is the easiest champion for a newcomer? I'm a FPS gal and rarely venture outside of Halo. I figured it's time to step out of my comfort zone. What's a recommended champion for someone new to PC gaming? Gnar seemed easy enough after going through his abilities but I see some people say he's one of the hardest. Any tips for the game are appreciated. I don't know anyone who plays so I have no one to guide me through! Thanks in advance.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-25T04:03:26.947+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Some good starter champs are Ashe for an attacker and Garen for more of a tanky guy. Their abilities are much more straight forward, whereas Gnar has a little more complicated abilities and playstyle. Overall, I'd suggest trying out the practice tool as a good first step to getting used to champions.\n\nThis isn't quite the best place to get advice like this, but I wanted to at least touch base with you. In the future, you'll probably get a lot more help from others players in the Gameplay board!","replies":[]}]}
