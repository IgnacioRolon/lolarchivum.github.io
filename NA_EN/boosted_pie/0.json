New keystones are garbage for him no matter where you look at, the fact that he is an AoE user with bullseye mechanic makes both Thunderlord's Decree and Deathfire Touch useless and unnoticebale in terms of damage. Any other mage (except Ziggs whose kit is again a long range AoE) can make such a better use of them that it feels like I'm playing with a character 5 levels behind my opponent.","replies":[{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2015-11-24T17:08:30.304+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Perhaps the solution isn't more damage from those masteries, but more utility.\n\nXerath has trouble if someone leaps on his face. He unloads everything he has, but if they're not dead Xerath is in big trouble. Stormraider's Surge is the solution to that, allowing Xerath to get some more distance between him and his assailant. Additionally it lets him adapt an even stronger poke-and-run strategy against enemies at range. The movement speed could also help you chase down someone who's low health, not letting them get out of range.","replies":[{"poster":"Stars Shaper","date":"2015-11-24T17:58:40.424+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Sorry I'm good enough for taking my leave when ppl jump on me.

We both know the reality is that if the enemy is competent they'll get someone to dive you regardless, and that your stun lasts less time at close range.\n\n \n> It gets ridiculus though when a Viktor needs one point&click spell+AA to deal more damage than my full combo with half the mana and on the same range. Xerath is forced so much back that he is the one being sieged.\n\n525 range = 1700 range? Because that's the range of Viktor's auto attack. Xerath's Q + Lich Bane auto exceeds Viktor's Q+Auto damage, so if he really has the same range as Xerath then you should be fine buying Lich Bane on Xerath...","replies":[{"poster":"Stars Shaper","date":"2015-11-24T18:55:04.297+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lichbane on Xerath is like building Spirit Visage on Teemo.","replies":[{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2015-11-24T18:58:09.574+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh, I agree, but you're the one complaining that Lich Bane + Q on Viktor's the same range as Xerath's combo and deals more damage than said combo.

Indeed I have exagerated things about Viktor but still if he ever manages to get in range for his skills he gets a lot more of uncounterable damage out then I can do.\n\nBut this is not the matter, I've never had problems dealing with Viktor pre -pre-season. It's just that he and other mages get far better use of the keystones. Viktor ultimate pops TLD with ease and even DFT is better on him. Xerath Feels left with a really short end of the stick.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"qetzel","date":"2015-11-24T16:03:50.337+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Deathfire touch isn't bad on AOE mages if you hit multiple champions with one ability.","replies":[{"poster":"Stars Shaper","date":"2015-11-24T17:01:01.904+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If the scaling was better, probably.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
