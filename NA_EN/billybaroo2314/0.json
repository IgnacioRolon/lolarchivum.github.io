I love your game, love the idea of it, but your community is trash and you deserve to lose anther player.  I got \"Perma Banned\" because my team said I did nothing to help them in ranked (took 3 dragons, a baron, pushed lanes, got them fed) then wanted to say \"get carried, you suck\" and finally I got pissed when we have an open baron and they want to farm jg after flaming me.  We won game, I just wish we would have lost, still pushed lanes, just wouldn't help them all.  Look, I understand that is not way to go, but your community needs to understand also that flaming someone may piss them off.  Someone who is 7/8/8 and taking objectives does not suck, they are helping team, but no they want to run mouth and piss them off fine.  You want to perma ban me because I hoped we would lose, fine.  Team did not deserve win since wanted to run mouths and not work as a team.  My friends already gave up on game because the community is terrible, I just liked it and tried.  Fine, you perma banned my account because I got pissed off enough to lose 1 game after winning 3 in a row because team wants to flame me, ok.  GIVE ME MY MONEY BACK I SPENT ON SKINS IN THE ACCOUNT. Your EULA says I have to work within team, ok, but team should have to not flame also enough to piss someone off.  I ask for help, I ask for someone to poke, or to watch aa's I rarely tell them \"you suck\" I never say \"Go kill self\" or any version, never tell anyone to \"uninstall\".  May ask to look at some video's to understand the game.  I get flamed told useless so quit helping and I am perma banned.  GIVE ME MY MONEY BACK.  Free game, I don't care but I spent money on skins.  Don't have to refund gifts, just look at account and skins.  I will be deleting your trash community game from my computer as you have requested by the ban.  To bad, love the game, hate the community that flames and thinks it's funny and if you retaliate in any way, I get punished. Ok......I have spent hundreds of dollars on the game.  I am done with it.  I watch LCS, Video's to get better, tried to play within your rules, but no, I get banned as I get trolled over and over, and then get fed up with people saying I suck as I am ahead in kills or just under in kda, but feeding lanes and taking objectives.   Gotcha......This is why you are losing players.  I know you will never see it, but I will look into legal side of this as you do nothing to help those that just want to play game, and not be flamed for playing it.  You created this problem Riot, and you expect people not to get pissed.  Ok.  Good luck, to bad, your game was fun, but I do want my money back as you can not regulate your community and only punish those that get fed up with trying to play and get trolled, or flamed enough that when they fire back they get screwed.","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2020-02-15T09:27:04.685+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":1,"body":"When Riot permabanned you, that was a step towards cleaning up LoL's community.

You didnt used any of these 3 chances , you got banned. \nYou broke the RULES you AGREED with when you made your account. \nRiot giving you the pernament ban says that they no longer wants you in their game, most of the community doesnt want you aswell.\nYou are free to make another account tho. I'm giving you an advice to change your behaviour otherwise you will be banned again.\nGL friend. Nothing personal buddy but thats how the things are. Breaking rules = ban\n\npst.
