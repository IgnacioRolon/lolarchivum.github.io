Just a few suggestions.\r\n\r\n1) MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO GET AN S if you lose the game:  have had to many losses because team is winning, a player is fed, and then they CS to infinity to get the \"S\" numbers and team loses because the fed player won't help.  If your team loses the game (team game after all) then you can not earn an S, S-.\r\n\r\n2)  Make objectives worth more then CS in shorter games:  A team that can push in a lane, win the game in under 15 min should not be punished because they have low CS.  They won lane, took objectives, and most importantly won the game before enemy team could recover.  Maybe make towers, dragon, Rift Harold, count more for entire teams Rating.  That way it goes to team play, away from solo.  \r\n\r\n3)  ANYTHING you can do to get the rating to match team play over solo play would be fantastic.  I love the idea of getting better, having a rating for how you play, but you can be 0/4/10 as an adc and you still had great damage, good cs for the time frame, and say a couple good MF ults, made the team win.  Yes they killed you first because they focused you, but if you die, team kills all 5 of them and you win the game, you still did your job.  \r\n\r\nMy point, Reward TEAM FOCUSED play over Individual play, especially in ranked for Ratings system.  I don't care if your a top Darius who is 20/0/10 with 300cs, if your team loses the game, you don't deserve an S because you were fed and obviously did not help your team win.","replies":[]}
