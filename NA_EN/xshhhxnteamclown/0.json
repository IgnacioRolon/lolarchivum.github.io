Because the fact is that i could have a higher rank, but i don't play ranked at all 'cause i hate it. So rank insults don't really work on me\n\nJust because someone else is breaking the rules doesn't give you the right to break the rules too. \"restore your dignity\" is that a joke? Like seriously? You think flaming someone will restore your dignity? Do you instantly lose your dignity if someone flames you etc? \"put the bully in place\" You flaming them isn't going to put them in their place. It'll just increase the toxicity\n\nIt's not really that shit tho, from what i can see it works pretty damn well. Is you flaming the bully going to give them an instant punishment? Nope, it's not going to. You aren't a vigilante. You flaming them isn't going to do anything positive. What you can do is ignore them and report them at the end of the game and they'll get punished, that way they'll get what they  deserve. You \"putting them in their place\" aka. flaming them will just get you punished too\nIf they don't stop being toxic, eventually they will get perma banned","replies":[{"poster":"DoranShieldOp","date":"2019-09-27T08:14:22.895+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah i am gonna wait for them to get banned one year later after our encounter when i no longer care about the game and totally forgot about the situation, very cool, and yes newsflash unnecessary flaming hurts and annoys people \n\nyou can pretend to not care about it all you want but in reality, you do, spare me the positivity crap i am tired of hearing about it, none is a vigilante everyone deserves a piece of what they are dishing out tho","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Love Anastasia","date":"2019-09-25T13:23:56.215+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":8,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Arcade Lulu,realm=EUNE,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=gbpUmAcQ,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2019-09-25T12:57:33.294+0000)\n>\n> Post logs\n> I seriously doubt that you just \"defended yourself\"\n> \n> You're allowed to defend yourself, feel free, it ain't gonna change anything, but if it makes you feel better we ain't gonna stop you\n> But you aren't allowed to be toxic while \"defending yourself\"\n> \n> How is riot enabling bullies?

You never have a need to talk about someone else when defending yourself. It involves defense of YOU, not offense of another.\n\nAlso, in the real world, where self defense involves actual physical altercations, self defense would be eliminating the threat.

I never mute, because I know I'm bad, so flame doesnt really offend me, its just truth and I laugh that they think that I'd feel bad for being bad at a virtual online video game. If youre offended, then yes, why wouldnt you mute? Theyre obviously not saying anything that improves your experience right?\n\nSo yeah, muting isnt for everyone, but its certainly a helpful tool for some. I'm sure it has saved players from getting their own accounts punished. Its a safe alternative to retaliation. The old saying is \"mute, report, move on\" but I usually just stick to the second two; report, move on. \n\n(I actually do use mute when someone is being extra bitchy in chat complaining about everything as they lose lane, fuck those people, theyre annoying af)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"xSHHHxNteamclown","date":"2019-09-26T11:02:55.199+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I got my post from last game i played but you can't see whats going on or what is being said to me. first 9, 10 was me trying to get them to stop arguing with each other, FYI.\n Here is why i was banned:\nGame 1\nIn-Game\nxSHHHxNteamclown: no pings huh\nxSHHHxNteamclown: pls ff aT 15 IF YAll going to be toxic\nxSHHHxNteamclown: yall argueing blitz been mid 3 times\nxSHHHxNteamclown: morg team game\nxSHHHxNteamclown: pls stop\\\nxSHHHxNteamclown: u are all weird asfuc\nxSHHHxNteamclown: you shouldnt play a team game if u dont realize so player have harder times\nxSHHHxNteamclown: but we were all there\nxSHHHxNteamclown: morg dont ranked\nxSHHHxNteamclown: SUCKY ADC ISNT WHY WE MAY LOSE ITS TOXIC CONVO\nxSHHHxNteamclown: TOXIC CLOWNS IN A TEAM GFAME CLASSIC\nxSHHHxNteamclown: U TOXIC\nxSHHHxNteamclown: she will be reported but all this clown talk\nxSHHHxNteamclown: is why we lost\nxSHHHxNteamclown: no u harrassing them is why we lost\nxSHHHxNteamclown: some champs are late game champs\nxSHHHxNteamclown: like our whole team\nxSHHHxNteamclown: but be toxic and blame\nxSHHHxNteamclown: she is\nxSHHHxNteamclown: y ou dont know all adcs need farm\nxSHHHxNteamclown: and still talking shitt\nxSHHHxNteamclown: kk noob\nxSHHHxNteamclown: why play a team game\nxSHHHxNteamclown: u are clearly going to lose alot of games\nxSHHHxNteamclown: just by convo\nxSHHHxNteamclown: thats who im talking to\nxSHHHxNteamclown: says the person throwing shotss at teammates\nxSHHHxNteamclown: from start\nxSHHHxNteamclown: u dont want to compete when your teammates flames u\nxSHHHxNteamclown: FYI\nxSHHHxNteamclown: everyone went down hill after morg flamed entire team\nxSHHHxNteamclown: that was epic\nPost-Game\nxSHHHxNteamclown: i hope so cause shes a toxic flamer","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jesi Oni","date":"2019-09-26T09:08:08.968+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Defend yourself just like you would defend yourself in real life my hero...
