Was not playing lol during this time, as I left my computer in storage. (I had a laptop with me, that I dabbled in a few Co-op vs AI games with, and bought some limited skins, but played very, very rarely)\r\nAbout mid 2015, I receive emails about changes on my account that I never made. Looking on lolking, I saw my account was being played, so I contacted Riot Account Recovery Team, and got my account back through them (I have emails to prove this). Changed my password on my email and account and all that jazz, and then left it at that. Never touched my account again since.\r\nFast forward to last week, and I receive an email my account has been perma-banned for using \"third party programs\". No idea what that means exactly or what programs they are talking about, but I can only assume it was during when I was hacked. Go figure.\r\n\r\nI try to explain that I have not touched my account in a very long time, but the staff member would not have a go at it.\r\n\r\nThis absolutely p*sses me off because I have spent a very large amount of money on my account ($1k-$3k) with skins and champs, as well as gifting other people. I have been a big supporter of Riot since almost release, and I very much intended to keep supporting the game when I moved back home later this year.\r\n\r\nbut now, my account is going to be taken away because some a**hole stuffed around with it, and Riot makes the assumption that it was all me.\r\n\r\nSo I lose my investment in this game, Riot loses a very good and loyal customer, and the hackers just move on to other accounts and stuffs with them, then those accounts get banned and so forth.\r\n\r\nWhat an absolute sh*tty business strategy that is. You guys are punishing good people, and the freeloaders and hackers just get to keep doing what they are doing and don't lose a thing.\r\n\r\nSorry if this seems rude, and that I sound angry, but god damn, this is f*cked up. Maybe I should have checked up on my account a bit more, but I honestly think this could have been handled alot better on Riot's part, and don't think I deserve to lose thousands of dollars worth of content because the security systems in place are lacking.\r\n\r\nI am no way in hell, going to make another account if this is how I get treated as a long supporting customer.","replies":[{"poster":"Prandine","date":"2019-06-23T11:08:27.077+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"While Necromancy may be handy (and sometimes needed) in video games, it's not the case for old forum threads.

If your account is Banned anyways there is no point in ever paying the balance back. Trust me I know, I have went through the procedure with paypal.  Riot has so many days to reply to a dispute on paypal and they never reply so it's an automatic win case, but the minute you win the case you receive an automated email from Riot saying your account is banned until you pay the balance back.\n\nIf Riot was to come after someone for a Charge back which they can't or wouldn't they would have to explain why they had 30 days to respond to the dispute and ignored it.\n\nAs for Being honest, if someone puts money into a Game and they believe they did not get the allowed time or use of that money because they got banned over unclear rules there is no reason they shouldn't do a charge back, it has nothing to do with being dishonest.. If You payed 100$ and Riot banned you 2 games after because they thought you were toxic and you thought you weren't who determines who is right?\n\nThe rules talk about suspending or even banning your account for toxicity but they don't put in detail what toxicity to them is... Racism? Hate Speech?  Or simply saying something to someone  who might get offended easily or disagree is considered toxic.\n\nIf they are going to make rules and expect people to follow them they need to be clear on those rules.. not just say toxicity because me simply saying \"Why the hell would you build AD Heimer\"  could be considered toxic to the player if he is easily offended or over sensitive when I'm simply asked a question as to why he is doing what he is doing.\n\nOn one of my accounts I disputed a Charge because I payed for a Week boost and was 2 week suspended the next day because someone wanted to troll our game and I called him an idiot. My boost ran out and I never got to use 95% of it, so why wouldn't I dispute it? It's not my fault Riot doesn't have a system that when your account gets suspended that the boost stops and is restarted when your account is unsuspended. They banned that level 6 account because of it but I simply took the money I put on that account and put it into another account.\n\nI've also had my main banned that I spent 800$ on but I didn't dispute it because I feel I had plenty of play time that my money was spent well and I accept that I was toxic enough to get banned.\n\nSo don't sit there and try to tell someone who you have no idea what happened , how it happened or why it happened that they are dishonest for doing a charge back simply because RIOT has one of the stupidest TOS ever.  \"They have the right to ban your account for whatever reason they want or no reason at all\"...  So if you spent 500$ and they banned you and you wanted to know why and they said \" Because we can, we don't need a reason\" you wouldn't dispute it? If so you're an idiot.\n\nThey may have the right to ban your account but I have a right to dispute my transactions if i feel it's not justified and if they have a problem with it they can always dispute the claim within 30 days, if they don't then that's on them.","replies":[{"poster":"SuperLuigiLXIV","date":"2016-02-26T22:34:07.103+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"They ARE dishonest for doing a chargeback.\n\nMaybe not by the legal term, but by the real world, they gave money to get into a theme park, and then threw a fit because they got kicked out for littering five minutes in. You can say until you're blue in the face that if they didn't KNOW, they should get their money back, and maybe by the legal definition they should. But that doesn't magically make it honest by any measuring bar that involves right and wrong in any way.\n\nYou'll note, for the record, that I never said he was doing something ILLEGAL, I was he was WRONG. This is a different measuring bar that both matters more and completely negates your entire post.\n\nAlso, I never told that dude what happened, why, or how. Penguin did. Scroll up. That's the story I went off of, and yes, I AM assuming it's right, because guess what? If two parties dispute toxicity, and one of the parties is Riot, they're generally going to be in the right, since they set the _terms_ of the situation.\n\nBuuuuuuuuuut by all means, come back and give me a bunch of legal jargon that I don't care about and that has no bearing on anything I said.

Civil court and private companies (LIKE RIOT) are completely different and do not use \"innocent until PROVEN guilty\" as the standard of proof.\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Biff Manly","date":"2016-02-26T04:57:28.577+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Look out Repertoir, another Rioter is challenging you for the throne of \"people's champion\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"Xietnin","date":"2016-02-26T02:53:35.869+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=mirageofpenguins,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=y5XtpzpL,comment-id=0009,timestamp=2016-02-26T01:24:48.448+0000)\n>\n> Heya Jus2Gud,\n> \n> Digging into your claim, it actually looks like the scripting occurred in two games during a period of established compromise.

You've been unbanned, and we'll be reaching out in your ticket with further information.\n> \n> For those seeking some of that hot context, I've made this decision due to the low frequency of abuse and the fact that you were quite clearly hacked (as opposed to voluntarily sharing your account).

I don't know the exact amount I have spent, but I have spent over a thousand atleast. LoL has been out for a long time now, and it is quite easy to spend money on the game. I have 1 or 2 skins for every champ in the game almost (save the ones that have come out recently). When I said rarely, I meant rarely played during my time interstate.\n\nThat is not the point though, and I don't think how much I spent on the game needs to be proven. Riot can see that themselves.\n\nMy point is, I was hacked in 2015, got it resolved through riot, then 6 months down the track my account is permanently banned for what I assume was done during it was hacked.\n\nI fully understand they need to maintain a reputation for keeping abusers out of the game, but they aren't punishing a bad person here. They are punishing a legitimate, customer who was hacked, and now loses all their content. Meanwhile, the real scumbags just carry on what they are doing, and ruin other peoples accounts.\n\nI lose, Riot loses, and the hackers and freeloaders win.","replies":[]}]}]}
