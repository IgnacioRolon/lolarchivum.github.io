You can bypass it by hitting **CTRL** + **ENTER** when you see the black screen in place of the loading screen, which will toggle you out of *Full Screen* mode and switch you over to *Windowed* or *Borderless*.

Tried disabling GSYNC to troubleshoot in game, apologized to the people I was playing with and told them my screen isn't stabilizing. I can't adjust options in game, thought I'd try and change display settings and see if that would fix the issue. My guess is that you've enabled some low level hardware controls in the game, and you're bypassing the settings that are controlled in GeForce Experience settings - which can be useful to handle clients that have settings that degrade performance and are unaware of proper setting controls, but you've totally locked me out and possibly others with similar configurations.\n\nEdit: Just to add, I normally play at 2560x1440.\n\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"Quvis","date":"2017-01-11T13:08:53.532+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have the same problem.","replies":[]},{"poster":"i dm other ppl ","date":"2017-01-11T13:32:07.011+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Can we get this fixed it clearly an issue on your end I just want to play the game and now I cant.","replies":[]},{"poster":"i dm other ppl ","date":"2017-01-11T13:31:59.032+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Can we get this fixed it clearly an issue on your end I just want to play the game and now I cant.","replies":[]}]}
