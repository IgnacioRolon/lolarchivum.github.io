Warwick stacks each of them 6 times with no counter play thus basically instakilling anyone.\r\n\r\nI liked the idea of attacking people with on-hit damage by focusing on an attack speed build.\r\n\r\nSo for the sake of other attack speed based champions (yi/adc junglers) can we change WWs ult to do the same damage but over less hits (like 3 instead of 6) so we can buff challenging smite and devourer.\r\n\r\nAlso for devourer it feels so underwhelming to build atm. for all that gold invested u only get 25 magic damage with + 1 per stack. unless your warwick who can get assists just by standing in a fight its almost impractical to stack unless u LIVE in the jungle. And even then you wont stack it enough to be relevant anyway. Can we get like 2x damage vs monsters or + 2 per stack or just 30-35 bast on hit damage (cuz 40 was too high and 25 is too low so something in between?)\r\n\r\nand challenging smites incentive was to be able to fight against armor stacking enemies with true damage and now with the tank meta this can be so much more useful if we can actually utilize the true damage as on hit true damage.\r\n\r\nTL;DR all im saying is i think devourer and challenging smite could use a little love but Warwick is seriously getting in the way change how many hits his ult makes so these items can grow.","replies":[{"poster":"Venowolf","date":"2015-04-19T22:59:39.406+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Warwick need the Zenon rework soon, Devourer and Challenging smite buffs, back the Wolf to the glory, a 30 base damage buff (instead of 25) can be a good initial damage and a good buff to Devourer, but Warwick smile with  that.\n\nBut Warwick was overnerf in the 4.21 patch, actually he needs a rework to put his kit more healthy.","replies":[]},{"poster":"shalec","date":"2015-04-19T21:35:24.378+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll agree that devourer is actually kinda weak now and it probably needs some small buffs, probably just returning some of the base on-hit magic damage that was removed earlier. However, I think Challenging Smite is probably the most broken Smite upgrade. If anything, it needs nerfs. It gives some really good true damage on-hit, even if it's a DoT, and it makes dueling the user much more difficult and near impossible. On champions that can abuse this, it's absolutely insane. Even on tanks like Gragas it's extremely effective.","replies":[]}]}
