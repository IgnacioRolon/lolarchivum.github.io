Since the mage rework, a lot of mages that were rarely or uncommonly played started popping up more frequently.  {{champion:112}}, {{champion:34}}, {{champion:69}}, {{champion:90}}, {{champion:50}}, etc... all became prevalent and have very good CC.  Many of these champions also synergize well with {{item:3116}}.  The item, {{item:3022}}, has become more popular too giving certain top laners some addiitional CC utility.\n\nMeanwhile, {{champion:89}}, {{champion:143}}, (and probably others that I'm forgetting) in the bot lane had some time to shine and both of these supports have tons of CC.  They also recently buffed {{champion:111}}'s CC.\n\nMost of the champions released this year: {{champion:202}}, {{champion:136}}, {{champion:163}}, also have pretty good CC.\n\nAll in all, there's probably a bit more CC in the average game at the moment.  It's definitely a lot harder for assassins without escapes and low mobility champions lacking good self-peel.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-09-03T19:47:22.512+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Go play DOTA, if you want comparison. enjoy the unmissable 5-second stuns.","replies":[{"poster":"Meep Man","date":"2016-09-03T20:11:25.581+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Different game, much more ways to counter CC entirely.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Vesarixx","date":"2016-09-03T19:10:53.239+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In Dota 2 you can literally be CC'ed for an entire minute","replies":[]}]}
