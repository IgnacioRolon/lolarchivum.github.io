Can some one explain this? I would really like to play again!!!! i thought about starting a new account but if i do then i will be playing that one and not working on fixing this log in problem to my account. ANY DEV input will be appreciated as long as it is some thing i have not already tryied! like requesting username or PW- resetting username or PW. Or opening a support ticket. Dig deep DEV's  HEP MEH!! HEP MEH NOW!!!\r\n\r\nPS-  (Typo's came with my keyborde and i cant uninstall them) so plz no grammar nazi's - LOL funny huh!!!!","replies":[{"poster":"RiotBok","date":"2016-03-23T00:52:47.740+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I looked into your account a bit and I'm seeing some unusual activity which may indicate the account was compromised, which is likely why it's asking you to re-log in when you click \"Settings\" on the website.\n\nSince this involves a potentially compromised account, we'd need to do a quick verification of ownership before returning the account.  In the meantime, I placed a temporary suspension on the account to prevent any unauthorized changes.  I know you mentioned some hesitation to do so, but can you go ahead and [submit a ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=38154)? Unfortunately we don't have a way to accept and verify personal information (i.e. e-mails, purchase histories, etc.) outside of our ticketing system.  \n\nIt's a bit long, but just add in what you know and we'll get it sorted out for you :)  Lemme know if you run into any problems with the process","replies":[{"poster":"Zethron Raizz","date":"2016-03-23T16:54:18.624+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have submited a ticket but on just the fact that i cant log in-do i need to do another on the posability of a hacked acount?\nAlso  Even though i am logged in to website and its asking me for login info (witch does not work) to see my support ticket- how do i log in to see my support ticket?
