I transfered my account from NA to BR (WodanMac), it is even the  in the same email as mine) and it is still transfering after a couple days. Can you guys help me?

I can't give that out here on the boards, but you should be able to be reminded of it by requesting a password reset if you can't remember the new username!","replies":[{"poster":"Svindler","date":"2017-05-22T02:43:12.435+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey man, thanks for answering. When I transfered my account, it **didn't** give me any option to change my username, but showed an option to restart League. Still, when I try to login into my account in NA server, it says \"your account is in the process of transfering. Please try again in a few minutes. If the issue persists, contact player support\". When I try the same combination in the brazilian server, it says that it is wrong.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-22T03:46:24.815+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I double checked your account, and the transfer process should be completed already as I can see your account sitting on BR currently. I do also see that the username was changed because it was already taken by someone else on BR, so your original username on NA is not the one you'll need to use on BR. Make sure to check for the new username if you can't remember it, and try hitting up our [**account recovery form**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=72416) if you still need more help!","replies":[{"poster":"Svindler","date":"2017-05-22T03:53:25.910+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for you help, Broporo. I found it with the username that I had before transfering to NA (my acc is from brazil, originally). Sorry to bother again, but I was Silver 5 on my Flex in NA, and now I am Bronze I. Is it normal?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-22T04:30:33.890+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Huzzah! I'm so glad you were able to finally get back in ^_^!\n\nAhhhhh that sucks a bit about your rank =(. When you transfer servers, you may have to play a provisional match in order to get placed again. Since it was so long since you were on that server as well, your MMR might have just depreciated too.","replies":[{"poster":"TheRainbowZebra","date":"2017-05-22T18:52:24.940+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yo, I am having the same problem, I transferred my account from EU to NA but the username was taken. Luckily it gave me the choice to change my username and that's what I did. After I changed it, I went on NA servers and I tried the new username and the password and it gave the message, \"your account is in the process of transferring. Please try again in a few minutes. If the issue persists, contact player support\". I then went back on the EU account and it said my RP is still there. So I did the transfer again and this time it did not tell me to change the username. I went on NA and tried the username that I changed, and it worked. I got into the account and hopped straight into a ranked game. During champ select, my game froze and it said that everyone left. I restarted league, and now when I try to log on with the same username and password that worked before, it tells me I have an incorrect username or password. (I am 100% sure that they are both correct.) I also tried going back to the EU account to see if it's still there, and it gave me the message \"your account is in the process of transferring. Please try again in a few minutes. If the issue persists, contact player support\". Now I have waited almost a day and nothing happened. Please help @Broporo","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
