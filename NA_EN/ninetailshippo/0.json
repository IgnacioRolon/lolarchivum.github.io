After leagues hasn't been responding for 10 minutes i force close, then get timers. the second time my entire team left before me (I could see in the chat logs that everyone left) and i still get a 15 minute ban.  I know 15 minutes isn't bad, i have other stuff i can do for now, but if it keeps happening i don't want to deal with longer bans. \n\nRanked games haven't had this problem so far for me. but I don't want to try new builds or champs in ranked.\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}}","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-18T18:04:06.352+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you are having a connection problem during champion select that's causing some hiccup and getting you left behind.
