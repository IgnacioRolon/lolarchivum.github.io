For instance my last game on Jhin, I was up an item on the bot laners and did lots of damage to everyone, I would sit back with my support during teamfights. As soon as the fight started though everyone would rocket forward and ignore the fact that a hecarim and wukong would dive me, despite me being the strongest member of the team. So what I was wondering is are there any ad carries that don&#039;t have to rely as much on teammates in teamfights? I am just lost on what I should do. It may just be a positional error, I don&#039;t feel that it is, but I would just like some others insight.","replies":[{"poster":"I hate my ADC","date":"2016-11-02T02:34:41.842+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You don't choose your teammates, but you can choose which champion you play. The best you can do when going solo as an ADC is to pick a champion that best fit your team. If your team has no peel for you, play Ezreal. If the enemy team doesn't have any diver and you have somewhat of a frontline, play Jhin. If you have a lot of peel and beef, like a Lulu and Gnar, in your team, play Jinx.\nIf you are first pick, well... play a safe pick like Caitlyn.\n\nObviously, you are gonna get bad games now and then where you can't do jack shit, but that's part of the game. Like I said, you don't choose your teammate. Win some lose some. There is no magic bullet ADC that will make you win all the time.","replies":[{"poster":"reaperteaser","date":"2016-11-02T03:50:32.764+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"tristana and lucian are good adcs for dodging divers aswell","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MrEnder","date":"2016-11-02T03:00:43.936+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your first mistake was picking Jhin in Solo que.\nSolo que means you have to solo the enemy team on your own.\n\nThe best picks for this at the moment would be\nCait (has amazing siege and escape. The best solo que ADC to carry with at the moment)\nLucian (has escape and a good ult more of a caster style)\nMF (Has very high movement speed and her ult is a game changer but a much harder pick to master)\n\nOkay picks\nEz (very good mobility but lacks damage and is weak in the laning phase)\nJinx (fantastic damage. Lacks mobility but has her traps and slow but well worth if you get good at stutter stepping)\nCorki (very hard to master but has great mobility and damage)\nTristana (has awesome mobility and siege but lacks damage compared to cait)\n\nIf you feel your team is somewhat reliable\nSivir (her ult with a good team is a game changer)\n\nIf you have a lulu or janna support. Two tanks with peel and a mid with CC.\nKogmaw (become the juggermaw)\n\nIf you are stuck going mid and you main ADC\nVarus (stay mid lane and push your tower down first use your AA's to harass)\n\nIf you have mad skills with stutter stepping\nAshe(has a stun! will win any 1v1 verse a squishy if she lands her stun)\n\nthe worst SOLO que picks would be\nKalista(lacks damage and range)\nVayne(lacks range and skill cap to high)\nJhin(lacks mobility and attack speed)\nTwitch(requires specific team comp)\nQuinn(doesn't fit the meta)\nUrgot(needs a rework)\nDraven(axes make him to predictable so he becomes useless at higher Elos)\n\nNow some of the champs that are bad at solo que are not bad champs they just require either very high skill or specific team coordination to work which you will not find often enough to be stable in solo que.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Neko Caitlyn","date":"2016-11-02T02:42:39.358+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Whoevers team has more tanks wins.
