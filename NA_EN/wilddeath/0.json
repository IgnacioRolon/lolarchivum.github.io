Also I believe the reason you usually like hearing what I have to say about things is because while being atheist the Egyptian concept of ma'at*( truth, balance, order, harmony, law, morality and justice). is really important to me personally. With that in mind what I wrote about the 1v9 might've come from a place of isfet (the opposite counterpart of ma'at) rather but me saying it in itself was ma'at cuz that's just how I feel about it. But you know since they say Ma'at comes out of Isfet (Order out of Chaos) I'll sometimes switch gears easier then I should lol.","replies":[{"poster":"Trump KAG 2020","date":"2019-12-13T09:40:48.878+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You are a trip bro.

In addition, they are constantly Reported.\n\n- Endgame stats alone don't differentiate bots from actual players. Some results can be very similar. That's not too natural for us to take that into account because we have a gaming culture but we're taking many things for granted, and some aren't that easy to get if you've never played a video game before. You can have players with the level of bots.\n- Reports aren't the norm. Most players encountering bots are beginners or don't care about their level so they don't even see there are bots.\n- The quicker the response, the easier it is for bot designers to find how detection works and how to pass through it.\n\nThat's a dynamic war, every time Riot will do something, bot creators will adjust. The current main policy is using the MMR system to let bots sink out of player's pool and periodically ban them. The only real matter is reducing as much as possible the amount of sold accounts (freshly lvl30 mostly), and the most effective way is waiting for them to reach lvl29 and ban them; this way you waste bot users' ressources as they can't tell until the very end if this account will reach lvl30.\nI've spent quite some time lurking at botted accounts and I can tell some are mixing bots with real players and play different queues when they're about level 25 to deceive the system. So Riot has to react to that, and so on, but eventually there is a threshold where it costs too much money to be more efficient.\n\n**TL;DR You can't stop botting. It can be reduced, and that's what is done. The bots you encounter are a mere fraction of what's going on; sure that's annoying, but you're already protected as much as possible.**","replies":[{"poster":"Trump KAG 2020","date":"2019-12-12T14:05:41.155+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its that simple.","replies":[{"poster":"Kalienor","date":"2019-12-12T15:37:17.863+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let me rephrase it.\n\nIf the only task is getting rid of bots, it's simple.\n\nBut that's not what we have here.
