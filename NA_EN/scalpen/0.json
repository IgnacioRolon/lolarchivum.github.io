Instead, there is a tiny window where a fraction of the screen is being shown in the top right. It won't let me click on anything, so I have to end up going to task manager and closing the game, to actually get it to work again. Any ideas on how to fix this?","replies":[{"poster":"Son of Ornn","date":"2017-07-09T03:42:15.487+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It might be an issue with re-rendering your client after the game!

I think it may have something to do with 4K scaling on windows.  Bug is also persistent through patches.","replies":[{"poster":"Anithais","date":"2018-01-27T20:09:12.217+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for the 4K comment. I just got a new monitor and have had this issue in my games since. Was afraid my client itself was just bugged or that I had messed something up when I changed resolutions inside both the game and client. This is apparently still an issue into the new season. Ctrl+ works, but I haven't been able to honor my teams until I found this thread. {{sticker:sg-soraka}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"anhomaan","date":"2017-12-08T13:40:59.787+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same, although with me I can mess around with some of the window resizing settings to get rid of the black portion on the bottom - however, the black portion on the right of the client remains.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Scalpen","date":"2017-07-09T04:08:26.939+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I made the client the right size, but it added a huge black area around it.
