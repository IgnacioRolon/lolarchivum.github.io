We wanted to talk a bit about how we&rsquo;ve been thinking about game pacing and where we&rsquo;re at right now. \r\n\r\n**Warning**: This is going to get a bit long. We&rsquo;ll have something better&hellip; formatted next year, but we wanted to talk about this earlier than later.\r\n\r\nA major goal of our preseason changes was to make the game have clear and reasonable expectations on teams as to what they need to do to win. For a long time, some of the actions that were most effective at winning (starvation tactics) weren&rsquo;t very intuitive or engaging for either team. Thus began our efforts to cut down on starvation and replace it with more interactive paths to victory.\r\n\r\nStarvation actually has a few different permutations depending on the level of play, but in each case (by definition) it leads to long stalls in game progress. Both teams essentially stop taking meaningful action. Winning teams are happy to build a farm lead, gobble up safe objectives, and elude any risky team fights. Losing teams, on the other hand, have no choice but to slowly starve out, unsure of how to take action or attempt a comeback. We&rsquo;ve been wanting to balance out these situations for a while now, but up until recently we didn&rsquo;t have confidence that we&rsquo;d be able to make the right changes while understanding their impact. \r\n\r\nEnter Insights!\r\n\r\nOver the past couple years, a group of researchers, analysts, and data scientists have been working toward getting a better understanding of **game pacing**, or the general flow and feel of the game. Game pacing, by the way, is a little different from **game length**, which is purely about the number of minutes a game takes to complete. When we say game pacing, we&rsquo;re talking about the progression of a game from laning phase to mid game to late game. \r\n\r\nWe consider game pacing from a variety of perspectives and multiple methods, ranging from game server data, all the way to survey answers that let us understand how players feel. Both sides are important to consider, as a game that *feels* well-paced but is always getting stomped out in ~15 minutes is just as concerning as a game that has meaningful back-and-forths, but all players didn&rsquo;t consider it close at all.\r\n\r\nOn the in-game data side, we&rsquo;ve started to hone in on a way of thinking about pacing that we&rsquo;re pretty happy with, so let&rsquo;s take a look at it: think about your games on Summoner&rsquo;s Rift. At any given time, one team has an advantage of some sort -- whether it&rsquo;s in gold, experience, or CS. Given the size of this lead and how far you are through the game, there can be pretty large differences in how confident you are that one team will win. A team that&rsquo;s up 5.5 k gold 10 minutes into a 20 minute game is almost certain to close it out, while a team that&rsquo;s up a mere 500 gold 45 minutes into a 50 minute game is likely in a head-to-head sprint to the finish.\r\n\r\nWe&rsquo;ve approached pacing by categorizing games into different classes based on: **how early we&rsquo;re (fairly) certain we know the winner**. On one end, games that are decided early are &ldquo;snowbally&rdquo; or &ldquo;stompy,&rdquo; while games that aren&rsquo;t decided until the very end have an &ldquo;overtime&rdquo; feel. Games that fall in the middle, where the outcome of the game becomes consistently more predictable as it progresses, are considered &ldquo;standard.&rdquo; The proportion of games that fall into each pacing bucket tells us quite a bit, and gives us a good sense of what we want to do if too many games are falling into any one category. It&rsquo;s worth noting that having ***only*** standard games isn&rsquo;t a desirable or intended game state. Teams that get super ahead *should* be able to close games out, while overtime nailbiters - where one fight seals the deal - are also awesome to have in moderation. \r\n\r\nAs we started using these tools to understand the current state of game pacing in League (and our ability to impact it), we set out to cut down on starvation tactics. More specifically, we wanted to ensure that the burden of winning a game stays on the winning team. This led us to changes like the biased minions waves that very slightly push into the losing team, doing two things. The winning teams get more chances to siege and meaningfully progress the game toward their victory. The other outcome is that the losing team has more access to minions, meaning that games slowly move toward equilibrium when winning teams get complacent. We layered this groundwork with some complementary tuning to gold income, tower durability, and yes, death timers, and we had a strong first attempt at improving game pacing. \r\n\r\nWhen the first Preseason 2016 patch dropped in 5.22, actively monitoring game pacing (and length) was high on our list. In terms of length, the average game was a bit shorter in 5.22 -- about 1.5 minutes on average. This, in itself, isn&rsquo;t necessarily a bad thing. When we looked at pacing, however, we noticed things were a little out of whack. Compared to 5.21, there were more &ldquo;stompy&rdquo; games. In short, games were being decided earlier than they had been, leading to more game time where the outcome was all but determined. A deeper dive showed us that both XP and gold (to a lesser extent) snowballing were the culprit. Our framework for game pacing allowed us to identify what was mucking up and dive deeper to find the cause. We adjusted the XP rewards from kills and shipped the minion changes, expecting the minions to either end stomps faster (thus removing the long painful wait for them to actually resolve) while helping losing teams access gold on the map.  \r\n\r\nWhen the data started to come back for 5.23, we saw some pretty encouraging things. Stompy games were down across the board while standard and overtime games picked up the slack. Although we&rsquo;re still looking into what exactly is the &ldquo;best&rdquo; distribution of game types, this was definitely much closer. In 5.23, there were less stomps, closer games, and a larger proportion of competitive game time. Not bad.\r\n\r\nThis work isn&rsquo;t done, but we wanted to let you all know where we were at, and how we got here.

We made a number of changes to address this (informed by both player sentiment and our pacing model), and managed to scale it back pretty effectively in 5.23. The work isn't done, but you're certainly not alone in feeling this way.\n\nI think this also brings up a pretty important high-level point: although we focused pretty heavily on the technical/analytical side of how we think about pacing in this post, we also lean heavily on player sentiment to help us make good decisions about pacing. If all of our metrics for pacing are where we want them to be but folks think it feels like doodoo in-game, then we goofed. We're actively measuring player sentiment through a variety of channels to make sure the game feels exciting, rewarding, and competitive. This is another piece of valuable information (in addition to our analytics and our talented designers' expertise) to make the best decisions we can. In short, pacing decisions aren't made in a hard numbers vacuum.","replies":[{"poster":"Earl Eulrich","date":"2015-12-18T02:10:24.491+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":0,"body":">and managed to scale it back pretty effectively in 5.23.

The starvation tactics for predation tactics shift is not a healthy one. \n\n> More specifically, we wanted to ensure that the burden of winning a game stays on the winning team.\n\nBy giving the winning team the control over how a game plays out you are removing the agency of the losing team. This will ALWAYS lead to games feeling stompy because there are no correct moves for the losing team. Before when you were being starved out you could farm and take any uncontested objectives. Now that the minions auto-push it is harder to take the unattended top turret while they are at dragon because you have to push the wave out first, slow pushes are harder to build, and they take too long to reach the objective. The tactics for coming back from losing games have been removed, and as long as that is the case games will feel stopmy.","replies":[{"poster":"ZT Xperimentor","date":"2016-01-07T01:03:32.432+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not to mention turrets are even weaker than last season; which means tower dives at 10 minutes in, are even more consistently possible at 5 minutes in.

Average game length dropped about 1.5-2 minutes in 5.22, and remained relatively stable in 5.23\n\n2. That's a really good question, and the answer is it really depends on what the problem space and our goals are. Normals is valuable as it's the way a huge number of players generally experience the game (myself included). There's also the added bonus of there being a TON of normal games to grab and analyze. Normal games tend to be really good when looking at high-level overall game trends, and things that aren't super deeply rooted in assuming players are all-in on being hardcore competitive. Ranked is basically the flip side of that coin. It's a smaller number of games (but still huge), and there's the assumption that it's more of a competitive proving ground (as folks are generally more willing to experiment with new champions, builds, and comps in normals and TB). For pacing specifically, it's pretty important that all matchmade SR games are in generally the right spot, so we consider both.\n\n3. We've just started taking a deeper dive into surrenders. In 5.22 we saw a small but meaningful increase in 20 minute surrenders (as well as many more games just naturally ending earlier, making a 20 minute surrender more attractive). We're still figuring out the best way to approach analyzing surrenders, and thus far it's leaned heavily on some basic metrics around timing and frequency of surrenders, as well as player perception about surrenders and general competitiveness of games.","replies":[{"poster":"AMYS GRAVE","date":"2015-12-19T03:00:46.119+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":1,"body":"I despise surrenders from both ends.

League of Legends is a game purely about playing offensively. Now we need to be clear, there are two sets of definitions that could come up, and the distinction between the two needs to be made. The first is the pairing of Aggressive vs Defensive. This essentially boils down to just pushing vs farming. The second if Offensive vs Defensive, where we give the word Defensive its second definition. This is the difference between making aggressive moves to elongate the game, vs making aggressive moves to shorten the game.\n\n>There is currently not one system in the game where a team can preemptively make an aggressive move in order elongate a game. Right now the methods for doing so are the same as the methods for closing a game out. Don't lose towers. Get farm. Take neutrals. Ward your flanks. From Bronze 5 to SK Telecom, these are the methods you have in order to not lose.\n\n>Its because of this that Morde's Dragon naturally had to be oppressive, and minion push changes had to favor winning teams. There is not a backbone of infrastructure that would enable any of these on their own to stand alone as a method to protect teams that want to opt into playing defensive. I'm using these two cases as examples not because they are the only ones I can find, but because they are two completely separate cases that have literally no gameplay interaction with each other.\n\n>The natural alternative is that Morde could be rewarded not for winning a dragon fight, but for marking the drag regardless of which team takes the objective. Suddenly, the juggernaut can chose to support a team that wants to scale with him, rather than lose access to his kit because his team's jungler wants to farm. In its current state, Morde's ult only rewards him for being on a team that wants to secure dragons early. This is completely independent of what lane he is in. More importantly, the reward he gets for achieving one global objective is a tool that allows him to secure more objectives. Teams that want to scale are obligated to take bad fights, because if they don't they're conceding much more than just a single dragon. Imagine if Tahm Kench only had access to the bonus damage on his ult after securing dragon. You'd feel neutered if you couldn't take the objective.\n\n>The minion push changes mirror the same issues with Morde's dragon. In order to activate them, you need to have both an XP lead, and a tower advantage. Prior to the changes, in order to capitalize on this, a conscious decision had to be made to prep waves in order to take other objectives. Now, in a move that has curiously been describe by the design team as \"rewarding defensive play\" by having waves naturally push further into the losing team's side of the map, a winning player has easier access to additional objectives such as Towers, Dragons, and Heralds. If you're a losing player who for example gets forced off of a wave, not only are you going to naturally have to try harder to get waves pushed out for you to leave lane, but you have a harder time reaching the rest of your team without risking losing the gold to your own tower.\n\n>With these examples in mind, lets discuss the greater issues at play here, which is that teams do not have a method to put resources into enabling scaling. If you pick a teamcomp that naturally falls behind early, you can't invest your early resources into preventing snowballing. This is different than choosing not to opt into negative situations. As an example of what something that enables this would look like, lets imagine an item called a Ward Trap. It would cost something like 50-75 gold, and would count as a pink ward. If you place it in a bush, and an enemy wards that bush after the trap was set, it would destroy the ward and turn into an untargetable pink ward for 180 seconds. Of course, if you walk into the bush you could see/destroy the trap, but that carries an inherent amount of risk. And if you fail to catch a ward, not only do you lose the gold from buying the trap, but you lose the inventory slot and truevision of the pink ward. Ohmwrecker could function the same way, by having stats that enable someone being pushed in to collect gold as they leave, but of course having to invest into potentially poor early game stats. Systems like this give teams that want to take a proactive defensive step a method of doing so, and force extra risk onto the offensive team, but by delaying their own goals.\n\n>Some of the coolest moments in League come from when teams who made two different, but valid, decisions clash, but right now systems that enable this are being removed, not added.\n\nI'd love to hear your thoughts on this, because I can respect that it may be an intentional design decision not to include these things, even if its something I'm in favor of.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bard Βard Bard","date":"2016-01-06T13:38:59.246+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"I tried to make appear how the game's pace changed since the preseason, from my point of view. I will be referencing to the very early game as the period of the game where no aggressive behavior can be engaged except jungle invades (you don't see 2v2 fights that lead to a kill at level 1 every game on botlane).\n\n**Season V:**\n1.

You don't have to think about what to do in order to really take the advantage over the ennemy team after taking the dragon.\nNow, it is \"Take an advantage. Here is a little bonus for you, and here another one. Now go snowball dem in da face.\".\n\nI am obviously exaggerating a bit, these changes are of a small scale, but they are sufficient to allow a team who's done a 4v2 fight botlane at level 3-4 to push a tower, take the dragon, and now play with the assurance of the minions pushing a bit more in their favor.\nIt could be okay if it was a counterable tactic. But in the current state of the game, you can't even prevent the ennemies from diving 4v2 botlane (even if you kill one of them, they'll still take your tower and/or go drake).\n\nI am sure those changes in making the games more snowball-aimed can be enjoyable, but they won't until a nice - as strong - strategy can counter it.","replies":[{"poster":"19019219_DEL","date":"2016-01-16T11:21:54.445+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> First is: This new mechanic makes everyone wants to end the game earlier.

Around 30 minutes, I cannot even count the number of times I have had 5 seconds to spawn while the enemy polishes off the nexus, and they only have one or two guys left from a brutal but strong teamfight. Why shouldn't defenders get one last chance to defend their base, after getting wiped in a desperate teamfight? A good team on of offense can take 2 inhibs and use that insane pressure to dominate the map into a pure beatdown. I want the overstay to become a thing again. Teams should have to question if they are getting cocky, going in for the killing blow, instead of annihilating the entire base JUST as everybody respawns. 50 minute games are different- killing the nexus while everyone is dead for another 30 seconds feels fine. But it's when you need those 5 extra seconds that you feel so cheated out of a proper defense.\nI feel homeguard is throwing things off. It seems too good, and this potentially gives the winning team (team that needs to get out there and apply pressure) too much ability to get to work. I believe making homeguard a dragon reward, say 3rd drag, would make it much more valuable and interesting as it gives you TIME, as opposed to mediocre stat gains.\nLastly I want to talk about how bad teleport is right now. I main top and mid, but recently I have a huge preference for mid because I feel like I cannot watch my tower and help my team at the same time. Being stuck with a 20-40 second timer on my teleport when I NEED that wave-and-a-half top has become a regular thing. I'm absolutely disgusted with the spell, butt I have to run it because it is entirely essential for life on the tropical island that is top lane. A level advantage in lane has always been a big thing, and right now it is that sort of punishment that a top laner must accept if he wants to assist his team for a dragon or countergank. The worst part is that after running your ass back to lane, the thing comes off cooldown and you have no use for it for the next 2 minutes or so. Please bring back the reduced cooldown for casts on towers, and potentially balance this out by increasing the cooldown to a ward or minion so the late game pressure isn't op. Do it for me, because I main Ryze <3","replies":[{"poster":"51656462DEL1","date":"2016-01-06T18:15:43.887+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Woah, THIS.

Did you guys intend for sandbagging teammates to be harder to solocarrry with these snowballseason changes? Because before if one or two people fed early and I was playing a carry there was a decent chance that we could pull through and turn it around.\n\nNow if one, or heaven forbid two, people feed the game is pretty much decided. If that's intended, then it's a pretty dumb move, and here's why:\n\nLeague is a team game, but for the VAST majority of competitive players in ranked (>95%), they play with people they've never met before and will likely never meet again. In a game where teamwork is the single most important determining factor in victory. Do you see how illogical making snowballing the end-all be-all in a 5v5 meta is? It only takes one person to screw it up for the other four, who may be competent, calm, and collected in their division. \n\nThe fact that one person has so much power to affect others with their negative performance(logically speaking, anything more than 20% is too much) is ludicrous and backwards. If I and the majority of my team do well in lane, teamfights, objectives, duels, and in general show superior skill and performance to all of the other opponents, we should win. Period. That's how competition works, the better competitors advance. \n\nI'm fine with snowball meta if I can get a group of friends together and accomplish competing in it in a cohesive and communicative manner.\n\nYou know, like in the new champ select thing you guys still haven't finished? Can you say cart ahead of the horse?\n\nIf the goal was to run the playerbase horse over with the meta cart, you guys sure did a hell of a good job.","replies":[{"poster":"51656462DEL1","date":"2016-01-06T17:47:19.964+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I totally agree, though don't be so hard on Rito, I think we're all sure they're doing their best.

Even if premades are much less common than solo Q in number, I feel that the BEST part of League is teamplay. I enjoy playing with my friends in a Ranked 5vs5, or just plain 5vs5, or just premades when 5 of us can't make it. Not only that, I also enjoy  being able to watch competitive teamplay, I enjoy high ELO spectating, I enjoy watching streams and youtube League. And I feel that pacing is more of a communication thing than just something inherent to the game state. It's the team that initiates a fight when and where they want it (and then has clear what it wants to take from that fight) that can capitalize.\n\nI know this might not be something you haven't already thought of, but what I mean is: \nIf you're guiding yourselves from the point of view \"we want to take into account the greatest number of games possible and that's why we can't pay as much attention to 5v5 or premades\", I think that low ELO players conform the \"most important community\" (as in, greatest number). Well, **I think that what a winning game should reward is the ability to teamplay, even in soloQ, and that even if you won all 3 lanes, you already have your gold advantage (kills or farm, both equally important) to pressure.**\n**If a team cannot exploit that in teamfights it's probably because they're not making the right decisions, they don't know _how to play on a greater scale_. **I don't wanna support a system where a team who cannot make good decisions to close out a game (such as in low ELO) is patched by the fact that when you win a fight and you get  a 4v2, all your lanes are pushing so badly you can almost certainly get one or two inhibs. Seems like too much of a game breaker, especially when the game was 10-17 in kills or something like that, not something you feel as a stomp. \n\nI dunno,** I feel like this system favors an unnatural snowball in lane in low ELOs that was not always visible in late game for a reason, and that's because they might not be better at teamfighting**.\nSo... give me your thoughts, tried bolding the most important ideas.\"","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"warpenguin555","date":"2015-12-17T22:47:57.033+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":3,"body":"Can the minion pushing turn off when somebody gets baron? when the wining team has both baron and super minions pushing down the enemy, the enemy feels like they cant do anything about it","replies":[]},{"poster":"19019219_DEL","date":"2016-01-16T08:47:46.346+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would like to add my vote to all those who say this season has snowball issues.

None are all that satisfying.
