The TL;DR is that after a long stretch of enriching the decisions around how to win a whole game, we needed more elements that can change how you approach individual fights. \r\n\r\nMany changes we&rsquo;ve made to the map and objectives have focused on strategic depth (the various elements that change how you attempt to win the whole game). Elemental Dragons and Baron buffing minions, for example, were all about making sure that different strategies produce games that are meaningfully different to play, and reward player adaptation over memorization of &ldquo;correct&rdquo; moves. \r\n\r\nAll awesome, but this left us with a clearly stand out issue: we have too few sources on the map for tactical depth (elements that promote different approaches to specific situations). We wanted to find ways to increase adaptation in individual fights, and we quickly found that the jungle, which already had unique terrain layouts and the red buffs serving as valuable skirmish objectives, had ample opportunities to do better. The Rift Scuttler, for example, creates the gameplay we&rsquo;re looking for at the edge of the jungle, with constrained randomization as a core part of her identity. In the first few experiments, plants proved that infrequent but impactful interactions could inject a lot of excitement while reintroducing tactical decision making that had been decreasing as players learn to predict the outcome of more and more fights. Put plainly, plants injected excitement into fights that have trended towards predictability and being solved.  They also were a fruitful way to double down on the feeling that the jungle was a living, wild space.\r\n\r\nLet&rsquo;s flesh out some details. Plants are small, single use neutral objects that activate when attacked by a champion. They spawn in semi-random locations in the jungle (similar to Bard&rsquo;s chimes), and respawn after a window of regrowth. Their spawn points are fairly restricted for early game, making sure they can&rsquo;t have too much impact on early gank routes or invades. We also ensure that plants have extremely strict rules around fairness: teams should have balanced access to each plant that shows up in the game. Plants also telegraph themselves to ensure players have adequate windows to adapt, showing up as a seedling 30 seconds before they can be used. \r\n\r\nOne plant we decided was ripe with opportunity very early was the Blast Cone. Look, a plant!\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVL-zcE5G0I\r\n\r\nImagine it as a universal Ziggs satchel, throwing all units away from the center point when attacked. These can provide some dramatic jukes or be used to throw an enemy where they don&rsquo;t want to be. They are also frequently used to allow champions without dashes to hop over key walls and, yes, they spawn behind dragon and Baron Nashor pits. \r\n\r\nIn development, it also became clear that Plants had a lot of overlap with Smite Rewards, but with much better visibility, mastery and impact across game time. However, We wanted to ensure that Junglers still kept the meaningful difference when it came to jungle routes and being able to optimize the jungle to different goals. The result was changes to the jungle camps themselves to better express the strengths of different types of junglers. That gives us a lever to support a wider range of junglers at the same time, which Smite Rewards struggled with throughout their lifetime. More details about the camps that are changing in the near future.\r\n\r\nWe moved the interesting tactical reactive power of Red Buff smite into Smite itself, as well as the new restorative Honeyfruit that spawn in the river. This one&rsquo;s totally designer art, so don&rsquo;t expect the explosion of oranges when these show up on Summoner&rsquo;s Rift.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYsw0qINN2c\r\n\r\nWe also found ourselves missing the vision tools of Raptor Buff, and brought those into the Scryer&rsquo;s Bloom. \r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TEKWvJjkng\r\n\r\nThink of this plant like a magic dandelion filled with Hawkshots, revealing champions **and wards** in a large cone. So while Smite buffs won&rsquo;t be on our buff bars in Season 2017, I&rsquo;m confident the best moments they provided will still be in our games. \r\n\r\nThat said, we are trying some really new things with plants. We&rsquo;re committed to making sure that they both land well, but also that they have the space to flower into a great addition to the game. We might make significant changes as the plants take root, to things like where they spawn, what they do, and how often you interact with them. \r\n\r\nHope this helps give everyone a better idea of where we&rsquo;re going with plants, but feel free to leaf any comments below if you still have questions!\r\n\r\n-Fearless","replies":[{"poster":"Gromp Hellscream","date":"2016-10-13T03:46:26.980+0000","up_votes":722,"down_votes":28,"body":"This looks extremely gimmicky.

Basically, if they choose a side path that doesn't have a plant in it - the other play attackers can make is to use plants to do a wall-hop flank to cut them off, which has also happened.\n\n> Yawn.

Especially when introduced into something as strategic as the jungle role. It is incredibly infuriating when someone gets a competitive advantage because RNG for that game was on their side. \n\nIf you take something like the Elemental Drakes, for example. I do not think that random drakes is a good system, however it was better than the current dragon system at the time which was a broken system. No one wanted to take dragons, no one would take risks to fight over dragons, there was very little benefit to taking dragons that were not entirely safe. So this needed to be revamped, it was broken. It caused issues.\n\nWhere are the issues in the jungle? Right now the issues in jungle for me personally is how the laners interact with the jungler. Examples of this is bot lane requiring to take a camp majority of games in which players are capable of executing it, mid laners getting mad if you do not give over blue buff, laners taking jungle farm whenever they want because they want extra gold even if it screws over the jungler. I see no attempt at trying to aid these issues.\n\nInstead what we see is trying to fix a system which is currently working fine, you do not and should not do a full clear every game. You should not do the same pathing every game. You should not do the same pathing for every single champion. You should not smite the same camps every time. This is not an issue. Why is it trying to be revamped by a gimmick?\n\nThis feels like if someone at Riot's development team deciding CS is now boring and you have to CS the same every game, so they introduce a new system where minions come out with random HP levels, and some give lesser-red buffs and lesser-blue buffs. That would be really annoying, right? You're laning correctly, you're winning lane and all of a sudden, the enemy gets a random blue buff-minon and can now just start spamming spells on you.\n\nRiot's balance team did well during season 5 and 6 for the jungle finally, making it a role that gives you options to play as a carry, or to play as a supportive champion, or to play as a enabler. Right now, we have champions in the meta that are carries, enablers, supportive champions. It's great, you don't have to be a weird cross-breed of support and top now. Then this proposed change comes along and just messes with it all? I don't support this at all and I think the idea of implementing RNG in the jungle for a issue that does not exist should not be introduced.\n\nChanges like this feels like a negative over a beneficial change. The jungler who gets the good RNG feels great, the jungler who gets unlucky feels hard-done by. Doublelift made a joke about creep block a while ago which fits this relatively well, it's like you're walking in LoL and sometimes your character just trips.

I'm not a fan of the plants. It's adding too much clutter and randomization to the game. Dragon buff does enough of this already. If you insist on having plants spawn, they should only be spawning a couple of times a game and in designated areas (such as how the scuttle crab does). This encourages consistency and allows teams to better plan around them. Their impact should be minimal, but also noticeable (think scuttle crab vision minimal). A  janna ult/ziggs satchel charge are not appropriate for plants and should be restricted to champion kits, not random jungle elements. I am just not sold on the plants as a whole. I see them doing more harm than good. If I was that Karthus from your video I would be pissed Gnar received a bunch of random plant healing, while my ult went on a huge ass cooldown. If you insist on keeping them random all over the map, why not have them grant small amounts of vision like the scuttle crab does? This might be a way to get teams more involved in vision control, rather than that being only the job of the support. \n\nAdding new elements to the game is fine, but I don't think now is the time to add plants, at least not anywhere near on the scale you seem to be suggesting. Season 6 was a perfect example of having too much change with not enough of it being thought out. I'd hate to see season 7 go the same route :/ I think we can all agree season 6 was the worst season for league's integrity both competitively and game-health wise. We need to focus on refining this season, not adding in a bunch of new elements like this. What is the point of plants? What do you want it to accomplish? Change for the sake of change isn't good.

It reminds me more of something you would see in Heroes of the Storm which, while good for some dumb fun, is a game that's struggling for player/viewer base partially due to its poor, shallow map design issues, which is exactly what these plants sound like.\n\nIllusion of depth is not depth.

League needs more rewards for skillfull plays /decision making and less RNG elements to the game. Stop trying to make the game more casual and try to make it require MORE skill not less. Striving to get better at a game that is hard is in itself a big part of enjoying a game. And the game already is easy if you are a new player vs other new players, it doesnt need fixing, it needs an even higher skill cap.\n\nAnd this is a step on the OPPOSITE direction of what the game needs. It needs LESS RNG, a ton more skill based changes. You already messed up trying to force Dynamic Queue despite the feedback and took you a whole season to correct your mistake (should have brought soloq back at the start of the season right after the backlash of DQ) because you were too stubborn to admit you messed up. DONT do the same thing with this thing, scrap the idea while you have time, you already said youll bring soloq back which is a step in the right direction, DO NOT ruin it with this. Season 6 was already the worst season, with dynamic queue and the \"lets all be friends and casuals attitude\".\n\nWhat makes the top games alluring is the high skillcap and striving to get there while enjoying the ride. Dumbing down and randomizing the game is never gonna be the answer.

For the unaware: In the river every few minutes two runes spawn. One is a majorly important rune that does something major while the other is a small rune that's worth about a handful of CS or so. Now, this (like plants) is RNG and can be stupidly powerful or stupidly useless. HOWEVER:\n\n* Runes always spawn in a static location, unlike plants.\n* Runes always spawn at the same time.\n* Runes affect stats more than providing a different effect.\n\nIf I may make some suggestions, from the look of it plants provide too much gimmick power in a short span while also being occasionally useless. Some suggestions include:\n\n* Having the spawn point be static. One at each entrance to the red-buff jungle. (Right by Baron/Dragon)\n* Have the buff spawn be static as well.\n* Add more varied plants. Right now there are three that only do vision/knockback/heal. Of the three, I'd imagine the vision/heal are always best with heal being the most generically good.\n\nOther games have proven such a system can work. However, as it is now, I don't think this is the right implementation.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Human Brick","date":"2016-10-13T03:52:36.794+0000","up_votes":27,"down_votes":1,"body":"idk how I feel about this as a Jungle main, I really liked the intentional situational choices you could make with your smites. While yes this did make it annoying for Junglers with Challenging smite to give up a smite bonus for the risk of needing to fight someone soon; it also felt better picking a smite depending on your situation. i.e. I would smite raptors a bit before dragon/baron was spawning to not need a sweeper or pinks (while they are good) or smite Krugs then go smack a tower for bonus damage and faster seige for first blood turret. It will also be annoying having these situational choices turn into rng for if you get the right one in the right place at he right time (if I am interpreting this right).
