Runes Reforged will be on live in a handful of days! We wanted to do one last communication piece for you all about how Runes Reforged has changed pregame decision making, and how you can expect to change up your runes before a game of League of Legends.\r\n\r\nQuick run down of how Runes Reforged changes pregame power and decision making: \r\n\r\n* There are fewer runes in the new system, but their power is concentrated far more than we saw in previous Runes or Masteries.\r\n* Runes are now free, and can now be changed in champ select\r\n* Players that reactively select certain runes stand to gain substantial power over generic, less optimized builds\r\n\r\nThis last point is one that we haven&rsquo;t talked about directly too much, though it&rsquo;s a core element of the design. In order to ensure that most champions get to make decisions in most of their games, we&rsquo;ve spread the types of decision between options that focus on your own champion and options that care about your allies and opponents. \r\n\r\nLet&rsquo;s go through some examples: \r\nResolve features one slot that asks what defenses you need in the early game, or gives you the greedy option to beef up later, at the cost of nothing in the laning phase. This decision very directly asks who is your lane opponent, and how much of a threat they bring to you. \r\nGathering Storm offer&rsquo;s a similar question. Few runes offer as much power in the late game, but it offers much less if your game ends at twenty or twenty-five minutes. You might chose this on a Veigar or Karthus to live the late game dream, but you might also pick this in a lane where you don&rsquo;t think early aggression will be fruitful. \r\nA few reactions can be very particular. Perfect Timing is a great example of this. Against a Zed or Kayn, or other champions with highly telegraphed damage, this rune can safe your life, and put you up in the race to get a vital legendary item. However, in case where you don&rsquo;t need the stasis, you have a filled inventory slot and full slot&rsquo;s worth of opportunity cost. \r\n\r\nAs an aside, we know this sort of decision making takes time. We&rsquo;ve added time in champion select and will be watching the various queues to make sure each mode has enough time to avoid feeling rushed, especially for the later picks. \r\n\r\nWith runes having a lot more situational power, it&rsquo;s likely that guides and experts will need to adapt to a world where pregame choices don&rsquo;t have simple &ldquo;right&rdquo; answers. We still expect that players will get a lot of benefit from using guides as a starting point, but more than ever, reactive decision making will be very powerful. This means that guides might have to give extra context on some suggestions, accept a level of inaccurate recommendations, or show a wider array of possibilities. We&rsquo;ve worked with a number of the guide sites to give them info right away when the system launches, and give them a heads up about the more contextual nature of the system. \r\n\r\nFinally, I wanted to reiterate one last time that this really is just the beginning for us. We&rsquo;ve done our best to get the system balanced for launch, but a change this big is going to have some bug, and some power imbalances that we just couldn&rsquo;t find or fix fast enough for release. We also ran out of time for some features we&rsquo;re really excited about, like how we show runes in end of game, or providing a really high polish option for runes selection out of champion select. \r\n\r\nWe&rsquo;re also aware that some particular champions have fewer options in the new system. Some champions will never have a multitude of options, but we do want champions to have at least a single Keystone and path that feel suited to their needs. Lastly, we&rsquo;ve also only got the first attempts in for feedback stats for runes. You&rsquo;ll be able to see these in your match history, and eventually we&rsquo;ll get these in end of game. If there are stats you&rsquo;d find valuable to understand the performance of a particular rune choice, we&rsquo;re invested in build the tools for players to understand their choices and evolve their approach to the game.\r\n\r\nThanks everyone!

When we were looking at Runes Reforged we were really taking pieces of both systems - the paths like you mention are very mastery-like, while we have some individual options that feel more rune-like. In fact, we found in testing that a lot of players really associated \"runes\" with stat choices and we ended up including more of those in the system (see: Cosmic Insight etc.) because players asked for them. I think we could've gone either way with the naming and had it work, really. \n\nOne consideration for \"runes\" came from the art side of it. We've always wanted to visually represent choices/customization in the art of the system - as you may have seen we have a representation of your keystone in both the UI and in the art. The versions of these in the art have always looked more symbolic & reduced compared to the UI icons (at one point we explored like literal glyphic carvings for these, for example). \n\nEventually, after we settled on the runes name we did even more on the UI to make them FEEL rune-y there too - chunky slotting in sounds & slotting in animations, etc. \n\nAlso, tbh, one thing I like about the decision for \"runes\" is that there's less verbal overlap with \"champion mastery\"  but that's just a personal thing.","replies":[{"poster":"Naqel","date":"2017-11-04T00:28:02.598+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fair as this is for an explanation, the dissonance could be entirely resolved with more rune-like names.\n\nThe aforementioned Cosmic Insight comes to mind, as it is very easy to imagine \"Rune of Cosmic Insight\", but much harder to do the same for something like \"Press the Attack\".","replies":[{"poster":"Sparkle","date":"2017-11-06T19:07:19.072+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's a fair critique of the naming, for sure","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2017-11-06T19:29:33.255+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot Sparkle,realm=NA,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=Vrr0vTuJ,comment-id=0002000400010000,timestamp=2017-11-06T19:07:19.072+0000)\n>\n> That&#x27;s a fair critique of the naming, for sure\n\n...as someone these somewhat sporadic naming conventions also bothered, I'm hopeful for really silly patch notes in the future like \"**Press the Attack** renamed to **Rune of Ceaseless Aggression.**\" :P","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Nefas","date":"2017-11-03T23:47:12.127+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"It seems a lot like it was done because Runes were the paid system and Masteries were the free one.

It could even possibly turn a tower into your own for a little while. Of course, it would need to have a substantial cooldown, or maybe being only a one time use, perhaps even with a channel time so enemies can get out from under it first. \n\n{{item:3060}} seems like a different version of Minion Dematerializer, but it turned into a smaller rune, could be a good way to assist pushers that seem to want more help. \n\n{{item:3004}} is the least problematic of these.

Also a number of those choices don't feel very impactful regardless of which I take.

I made a post in the EUW forums about that and I would like to hear RIOT's opinion about that.\n\nthere are so many strong runes and synergies in the new system that being forced to give up a full tree just in order to make a champion functional feels really unfair and is going to bring a lot of problems. having to choose between a worse version of meditation and ultimate hat, for example feels really bad since you can't pick both. in my opinion, the mana regeneration nodes should be all clustered together and players should be able to choose between one of them.\n\nplease read my post in order to understand the full context of what I'm talking about.\n\n[https://boards.euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/champions-gameplay-en/25IfApEA-the-new-rune-system-needs-a-mana-regeneration-passive](https://boards.euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/champions-gameplay-en/25IfApEA-the-new-rune-system-needs-a-mana-regeneration-passive)","replies":[]},{"poster":"AFilthyCaitMain","date":"2017-11-04T09:06:04.357+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Would you consider giving Illaoi back her E interaction with Dark Harvest?
