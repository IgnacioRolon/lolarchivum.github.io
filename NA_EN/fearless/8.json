The current one is an old classic, but there are a lot of things we want to improve, so let&rsquo;s talk context.\r\n\r\nA cursor should always be clearly visible and easy to track on your screen. This one seems obvious, but isn&rsquo;t always easy to achieve. League often has moments with a lot of visuals competing for our attention, especially in a big teamfights with dozens of spells flying back and forth. \r\n\r\nThe classic cursor can sometimes get lost against the background, because its brown and yellow colors are pretty close to a lot of parts of Summoner&rsquo;s Rift and its rounded, busier shape can be hard to pick out. We&rsquo;re hoping the new version is brighter and cleaner, making it easier to see throughout the game.\r\n\r\nCursor Comparisons\r\nhttps://i.imgur.com/6vOltoG.png\r\n\r\nhttps://i.imgur.com/bRSu4Jf.png\r\n\r\nTo make it even easier for players to always find the cursor, we&rsquo;ve also added the ability to scale the size up and down - good news for anyone using a 4K monitor!\r\n\r\nA cursor should also give us immediate feedback for our actions. For example, the old cursor changes states (shapes and colors) to acknowledge when we&rsquo;re doing different activities like hovering an enemy or placing a ward. We are still trying a couple different approaches on how to surface this info, and are looking for feedback! \r\n\r\nHover Enemy\r\nhttps://i.imgur.com/pCU38Sm.png\r\n\r\nHover Ally\r\nhttps://i.imgur.com/rpNUiXQ.png\r\n\r\nPlace Ward\r\nhttps://i.imgur.com/Rr5Alew.png\r\n\r\n**Feedback pls!**\r\nThe cursor is a feature that every player uses throughout their games, so we are going to give this a couple PBE cycles to soak and respond to feedback. We definitely want to hear your thoughts, especially in a few areas:\r\nDo you feel like you&rsquo;re getting the feedback on your actions that you&rsquo;re looking for?\r\nIn what situations do you most notice the changes?\r\n\r\nhttps://imgur.com/a/ji1EKYo\r\n\r\n**But My Bronze Gauntlet?**\r\nWe know a lot of people have grown to love the old cursor, so when we ship the update in a few patches, you&rsquo;ll have a &ldquo;Legacy Cursor&rdquo; toggle in the options menu allowing you to switch back to... the legacy cursor. \r\n\r\nWhen 8.12 hits PBE today, the **Legacy Cursor** toggle will be disabled so we can get as much feedback as possible. We&rsquo;ll add the toggle part way through the cycle so we can make sure that works, too. Once 8.12 gets ready for shipping, both the new cursor and the toggle will vanish from PBE. Then they&rsquo;ll reappear for the 8.13 PBE cycle in a few weeks. We&rsquo;ll repeat this process a few times until the new cursor is ready to ship.","replies":[{"poster":"TomiMan7","date":"2018-05-30T21:09:12.744+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":0,"body":"The \"hover enemy\" and \"hover ally\" is waaaaaay more clear and visible with the **legacy cursor**. I really dont like that option with the new one.\nOtherwise it looks good at first glance\n\n_**EDIT:**_\n\nAlso why not go all out? When warding, the cursor could change into a little ward(different color when warding with different wards!!), when warding into a bush it could turn into a bush that has a little ward right next to it. Same goes for \"hover enemy\" and \"hover ally\", make the cursor change. That way its way more visible to everyone,more visual info, also makes it more \"futureproof\". The old cursor is not bad, dont ditch its features. Improve upon them :)\nIf you make something new, that you want to last, go for it. Not just change it cos its old.

(if you're trying to click between and enemy and an ally with a spell that does different things based on target, this would be much more useful I think) How about a mix, where the current color change works for minions and monsters and such, but the entire cursor changes color on high priority targets like champs, towers and drake? (I like the new base cursor.)\n\nI honestly don't like the new ward and spell select icons, they look like someone was trying to come up with a new design for the sake of having a new design. The old ward icon had much more _breath_, much more _free space_ in it, which, for me, is more appealing and more clear (less cluttered design, more simple design, more clarity regarding what is behind the cursor (even if this isn't THAT important, as the cursor itself doesn't take up much space anyway, but it does FEEL like it's a big difference)).\n\nNot sure what to think of the caster cursor yet, except regarding single-target casts: the exact same as about the ward cursor.","replies":[]},{"poster":"aezens","date":"2018-05-30T23:57:15.211+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think it would be more clear if the whole cursor changes the color not just a part of it.

A definitely improvement, although I honestly find the floating square a bit distracting, as the stronger lines around it (due to being straight) take a lot of my visual attention *and* a smaller element is something we're use to seeing as the focus point, whereas in this case it's actually on the opposite side of the focus point. Just a bit weird, and I'd personally look into other options there.\n\nThe ally/enemy hover is similar -- they're visually clear, but I'm getting my information from an element that *isn't* the part I'm hovering right over my target. I'd almost rather see the top half of the two-tone triangle change so my eye isn't looking past 10-12 pixels to take in the color of the square. They're much cleaner than the old cursor, but they lose the immediate \"tell your target instantly by the shape/color of the point of contact\" that the old cursor had.\n\nI feel similarly about the warning cursor. It's clean, but it's also busier, and the larger interior dot (and tighter ring around it) actually make it a little harder for me to tell *precisely* where my ward will go, which is frustrating with some of the precise ward-tricks where you can eek the ward over a wall by positioning the center just right. I'd encourage making the dot smaller and maybe increasing the size (or decreasing the thickness) of the surrounding circle a tiny bit.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Globux","date":"2018-05-30T20:51:31.781+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"I really like the idea and look of the new cursor. It´s really something we needed since the update of the map. My personal opinion on this sorts out like this (some experimental stuff added just in case something of that might give you a solution for an upcoming problem):\n\n**Pro:**\n\n* Looks clean\n* Has a defined shape and colour\n* Easy to see in colourblind mode, but it might get lost over the yellow healthbar\n* Updated 4K-Resolution\n* Nice update on the warding-crosshair, but the cross in the middle might be a litle bit to big for some wall-ward-tricks\n* The \"click\" (hitbox) now is on point and not any longer \"somewhere under the fingertip\"\n\n**Cons:**\n\n* Less defined actions without shapeshifting (I really liked the sword-icon)\n* The colour changing dot at the end is too small (Maybe make the actual cursor head change the colour and keeping the dot yellowish?)*\n* It feels just like \"hovering\" over the map and objectives without \"taking action\"\n* The \"Go-Here-Animation\" is still the same (it´s not cursor relevant, but still outdated in my opinion)\n* Still a bit tiny --> Maybe making people choose their cursor size just like the HUD size\n* The tiny dot on the cursor isn't the active part of it = taking attention away\n\n**Crazy ideas and quality of life enhancements**\n\n* Give the cursor some kind of greenish layout when it´s hovering over a bush (helpful for warding)\n* Make the outline of the cursor change brightness when it´s hovering over dark areas and back when going back on more bright areas\n* Give it a kind of \"loading animation\" while waiting at the loading screen\n* Optimise the colour management based on the map playing on (TT always seemed to work better with the old cursor than SR did; ARAM was just chaotic)\n* Give \"special abilities\", types of spells/casts or even whole champions unique cursors depending on a special ability (e.g. Give Pyke some X-Cursor for his Ult when aiming right at an executable enemy). Maybe also just make it colour shift when right-clicking instead of left-clicking\n* Give it a togglable silent sound (maybe also only in the tutorial) so you can actually hear certain actions\n* Enable TP out of the store window\n* Show a different cursor in the shop depending on buying or selling\n\nAfter all, I´m pretty pleased with the actual design and idea behind the whole thing. It might seem a little bit generic on the first look, but hey, it´s still in testing. I just hope you guys get some of my points and find some ways to enhance the visual \"sparkle\" it somehow still needs at the moment in my opinion. If I could implement something on the go right at this moment it would be an option to choose from different cursor skins, but I think this would be just too much to ask for ;)\n\n\nPS: Would love to hear your thoughts (no flame, but critic or stuff like that) on my ideas. Eventhough some of them might be really stupid and extremely unnecessary or disturbing I would like to get them out here, because sometimes thinking a different can lead to another even better and really good idea!","replies":[]},{"poster":"catnip268","date":"2018-06-05T09:51:59.046+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"i don't like the box at the back that tell you if you are hovering an ally/enemy it is hard to see it its blue/red respectively, especially in combat. if it made the entire cursor change colors i believe it would be better but as of right now i think the legacy cursor is a better cursor than the new one, still need a lot of work guys.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The23rdGamer","date":"2018-05-30T20:32:10.586+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally I've became rather accustomed to the legacy cursor so I'll probably be using it.\n\nThe new cursor certainly stands out better as far as color goes however I do feel like the shape changing that the legacy cursor does conveys meanings much more effectively than the new one.
