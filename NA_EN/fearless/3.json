I failed to ensure that our patch notes reflected the intent of these changes, nor did I give Pwyff and crew nearly enough info to make that possible for them. I'm here to give the full context and also talk about how these changes fit into our strategy around the jungle right now. \r\n\r\nSo, the 5.1 \"Smite with Charges!\" change does a lot of cool stuff for the strategic freedom of the jungler, but we also knew that it would hit some of the same issues the Conservation mechanic had from season 4. Mainly, when you're not 'wasting' a resource with overflow, it creates very clear windows for the jungler to go do something else with a very low cost. In other words, a jungler waiting for Smite to come off cooldown can gank or go kill wards without feeling like they're making a deliberate trade for it. \r\n\r\nCombined with a few junglers that could grab a camp or two and then bring out very potent ganks, this meant that 5.1 created a situation where the optimal strategy for some of our most powerful gankers was to go back to their old habits of deciding lanes before laners had even hit level 2 (in some cases). Worst of all was that failing these ganks didn't really set these junglers behind, because many other junglers didn't have the ability to invade and punish them after the failed gank. \r\n\r\nThe adjustments were made to hit this specifically, so that guys like Jarvan and Lee Sin had a bit more of a risky start if they tried this, as would Shaco, Xin, and Panth, even if they're not currently centered in the spotlight. \r\n\r\nWe are aware that this change hurts some of the junglers with weak clears, leaving them with less gold for pots to stay healthy during their second clear. We know this is really painful when blind monks and dunking princes are taking over games. We know have a lot of work ahead of us. We've been making changes and adjustments to the systems around the jungle at a really high frequency, and that's largely complicated the work that could have been done on the individual items or the champs. We've already been having a lot of internal discussions about what we need to do as the dust settles on the systematic changes. The 5.2 changes happened because we know early gankers needed to be much higher risk, and the extremely cheap jungle items were a main contributor to their reliability. \r\n\r\nWe still need to carve out more space for our tank junglers, and we are still trying to give junglers more reason to invade and counter jungle. These actions are one of the core reactions necessary to keep gankers in check, and currently aren't functioning at the levels necessary for healthier play. Can't say it enough, we have lots of work ahead of us still, and we're committed to making this better. 5.3 is already very tight for changes, so 5.4 is much more likely for the next round of changes.","replies":[{"poster":"DrMarshSwamp","date":"2015-01-29T03:19:51.815+0000","up_votes":47,"down_votes":5,"body":"If you *know* that junglers like Lee Sin and Jarvan are problematic why are you not nerfing them specifically if they are the ones doing or causing these early ganks?\n\nWhy hurt every Jungler for the actions of a few?","replies":[{"poster":"Fearless","date":"2015-01-29T03:27:55.725+0000","up_votes":30,"down_votes":45,"body":"We knew the items enabled a pattern, a pattern that JarvSin ( Lee Vin?) were able to opt into, but it's not just them.

They say it's hard to nerf a champion on an individual level when you consider all the changes going around him. Yet, look at Elise. Riot nerfed her, again and again and again to the point she got butchered (just look at the first match of the split with C9 VS TSM and you will see how weak she is atm).\n\nThey did the same with Evelynn or any tanks junglers as soon as they got just a bit strong (think Skarner or Sejuani).\n\nWhy can't they do that with Lee Sin too? I think it's about time he finally taste the same medicine.\n\nI think consistency is the problem here. This is why many people, including myself, can't help to think that Riot is totally biased with some champions.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Keevalroy","date":"2015-01-29T07:23:04.943+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":3,"body":"I think you know very well what he's insinuating...","replies":[{"poster":"Derpy Mike","date":"2015-01-29T07:33:10.904+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":4,"body":"Don't doubt Riot's ignorance.

But how many changes, how much work can you do to deal with the problems of jungle without dealing with the main cause? And that main cause is trying (and failing) to balance the GAME around a Lee Sin jungle. Trying to balance other junglers around how strong/safe he is, well it's a waste of resources and goodwill. Once he is changed (not nerfed, not buffed, but no longer the safest jungler out there) your ideas to increase the healthy play of the jungle would most likely fall into place. But until then I don't think people really trust Riot to help the jungle.\n\nRiot Phreak said:\n\n\"They played mid Janna **because she was bullshit**. They played mid Soraka **because she was bullshit**. Pros really** like to pick champions that are un-counterable**. Their opponents are, just like them, extremely skilled League of Legends players. If you can find a champion that CANNOT be outplayed, that's a really strong champion to play in top tier play.\"\n\nAnd he then went on to defend Lee Sin, saying he didn't crowd out other junglers because he isn't that good:\n\n\"The following is personal opinion, so feel free to disagree. Lee Sin isn't actually the best jungler, **he's just the most fun** (and the most played across the entire playerbase). Thresh isn't the most powerful support, he's just **the most fun.** Do you really think we should nerf champions because they're more fun than others? You can make your own reasoning and have your own opinions on champion power at the very top tier, but as far as our actual matchmaking gameplay, objectively Lee Sin and Thresh aren't anything close to the most powerful champions in their role. I'd never ban them myself unless I knew I was facing someone who was specifically a \"main\" of that champion, just as I'd ban Urgot from an Urgot main.\"\n\nThis was when talking about pro picks. (So he was saying Meteos picks Lee Sin not because he is good but because he is fun)\n\nCan we really TRUST what a Rioter says when things like this are so clearly wrong?","replies":[{"poster":"DracosKasu","date":"2015-01-30T21:52:09.494+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem with Lee Sin came from the fact that he is too strong during early game and far too save during is gank.

These are the types of things I think the community would love to see, and when we talk about \"no Riot feedback\" these are the posts we LOVE to see.\n\nSecond, what? You know Lee Sin and Jarvan are problems forcing out other champions and limiting champion diversity. Yet your idea after roughly two years of heavy jungle work is to try and change things up. Yet every attempt has seen the same thing. Lee Sin at or near the top. Yes other junglers have had their day in the sun. But I don't know how long you can try to \"fix\" the jungle when one thing stands out in every season (from season 2 on). It's like fixing your breaks when you have a flat tire. \n\nSo if you are trying to hurt Lee Sin, Jarven why are you also hurting the ones that already are having a hard time? \nYou already have a new buff to Jungle Nidalee. You heard that right folks, she now stuns jungle monsters after hitting them with her spear. So we see they don't mind working on other junglers.

Tanks go straight into a fight, have natural survivability, sustained damage patterns, team utility/CC and are usually not attractive targets to try and take down if you've got any better options. Assassins by contrast tend to flank, have extremely high target selection and burst, low team utility, lack constant survivability (instead relying on other tools like mobility, untargetability, stealth etc) and are usually great targets to kill if you can focus them.

You (Riot) are placing so much money/time/goodwill to these jungle changes that you don't need to do if you just man up and deal with the issue at hand. Until that happens can you really blame people coming on the forums and bitching about why you are/are not buffing/nerfing champions/items in the jungle? \n\nHow many times can we see \"we are aware of issues and are working towards champion diversity in the jungle\" when the main issue is not dealt with and think \"oh Riot knows what they are doing we can trust them\".\n\nI know I (and almost everyone on these boards) love the game and Riot as a company. But you can't expect us to really trust any more. Again, thank you for coming to the forums to TRY and give us insights.\n\nLook if Riot just came out and said \"we want Lee Sin to stay at the top of the hill because we believe he brings in more viewers and more players\" okay. I don' think people would be happy, but we would feel we were dealt with honestly. And at this point, we don't. I am not sure there is a more scathing thing to say.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Leaf of the lake","date":"2015-01-29T08:44:39.429+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you considered helping the tank junglers keep a competitive clear by buffing the gromp passive? If it increased in damage dealt the longer a target was affected by it (think toxic in pokemon), either through a time element, or a stacking element per-hit against you, it would help to normalize the clear times between slow clearers and fast clearers. While this would help the fast clearers clear slightly faster, the slow clearers would see more and more of a benefit the slower their baseline clear is. If these effects are too strong against champions, there's nothing wrong with making them only apply to monsters, which is where the poison armor is really needed. \n\nSpeaking of poison armor, the krug buff is currently (and probably always will be) very strong for AA centric junglers, effectively reducing the damage they take during a clear thanks to the stun. Meanwhile, tank junglers, who are often more ability based and have slower clears, tend to start gromp, but don't get the benefit of any damage reduction while clearing. So perhaps another avenue to explore is making the gromp buff reduce damage taken from jungle creeps (like the tough skin mastery), letting the tank junglers stay healthy on their initial clear.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Slushi Simcambi","date":"2015-01-29T23:20:47.398+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like the idea of jungle Nidalee, but really, do we really need new jungle champions when many of the ones that we have are in such a pitiful state?\nWhy shake up the formula when the one we have isn't stable.\n\nUntil you directly nerf Jarvan IV and Lee Sin the problems won't end.

So far from what I have seen from all patches after the new jungle came into play is all of them have been focused on the jungling items and smite and not a single thing about the camps. That has forced people into really just using two of the smite upgrades {{item:3713}} and{{item:3706}} because the other ones were either nerfed because they gave one type of jungler to much power {{item:3715}} , or were just useless to begin with {{item:3711}} .

So I feel as though resources should not be put into the jungle items right now and should instead be put into balancing out the jungle camps for all kinds of junglers and not just the select few who can thrive in there. I still do not know why the jungle needed to be so drastically changed at the end of season 4 when that is when, in my opinion,  I found the jungle to be the most balanced and fun form that I have ever played in all the time that I have played League.","replies":[]},{"poster":"aperson1","date":"2015-01-29T03:26:00.040+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"you're a brave man coming here with this kind of post","replies":[]},{"poster":"Uiru","date":"2015-01-29T03:54:07.399+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":2,"body":"Your jobs regarding the jungle would be a lot easier if you'd address the actual problem.\n\n {{champion:64}} {{champion:64}} {{champion:64}} {{champion:64}} {{champion:64}} {{champion:64}} {{champion:64}} \n ~Uiru","replies":[{"poster":"Seminole Sun","date":"2015-01-30T05:51:34.279+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"You mean the 45% win rate across all ELOs Lee Sin?

Quill Coat.  If there were just a starting item like that for junglers now, they could probably come back without any real problems.  Although the amount of jungle items is already pretty high, simply allowing there to be an offensive and defensive hunter's machete would solve a lot of starting problems.  \nExample:  Hunter's Machete (Offense) - dealing damage to a jungle monster inflicts 10 bonus damage per hit (5 for AOE abilities)\n                Hunter's Machete (Defense) - Taking damage from a jungle monster or minion reflects damage;      from here it could be tuned to either reflect a significant amount of damage or have a decent restoration effect, depending on if this is meant to speed up tank jungle clear or help champions with a harder clear sustain through their troubles.  \n\nI know that the ideal scenario would be for every champion in the game to have a 50% win rate, regardless of their damage or meta position, and that's a great goal.  But the fact is, that will NEVER happen.  The game would die well before that.  And the reason the game would die before it happened, is because it would be boring as all hell.  The game is either imbalanced, or it's bland.  That's how this kind of game works.  The bland ones can have a much looser meta, because everyone is equal.  Everyone has the same types of abilities, and therefore the same effect on the game.  But that makes it boring, because everyone feels the same. \nA good meta allows for some imbalance.   Currently the meta pretty much places the highest carry potential on the highest damage output, which makes sense, it's a team game, some roles are made to carry the team and others are made to assist in that.\n\nI would love to see the day where Nautilus is just as Viable as lee sin, and Mundo is just as good as Riven.  But they're different characters, they fulfill different roles.   I liked Tristana, Sion, Soraka, etc.. Before their reworks.  Apart from Trist's range nerf lategame (would happily sacrifice some damage for it) and Raka's unique ability to restore mana, I like them better overall.  The problem is the idea about balance is that everyone should be on equal levels.  Screw that.  Let assassin's one-shot people, that's what an assassin does.  Let tanks roll over people, that's what tanks do.  Let early game champions be frustrating, and let late game champions be unstoppable.   Stop nerfing or changing everything that's strong, and start bringing the other options up to it's level.  Obviously there needs to be moderation, but come on, it shouldn't be that big of an issue.  \n\nIf you want to hit Lee Sin, give him less scaling damage, or less sustain, or higher energy costs.  Make him HAVE to do it right, or be punished for it, just to put more pressure on the players.  If you want to hit Jarvan, just give him even worse mana problems.  I don't have a problem with either of these champions, I just get tired of seeing them when I watch the game.  \nSo instead of tearing these two down, why not bring Elise, Evelynn, Warwick, whoever, back into light?  Hell, you nerfed the smite that made Warwick broken and then further gutted his ult.  You didn't need to do both.  Elise's damage is so minimal past the incredibly early game in comparison to other AP champions since the nerfs, and her utility is lower as well.  Evelynn can't even clear the new jungle without exhausting her resources, how's she supposed to gank early with no combat stats on hunter's machete AND no early gold from clearing camps or reasonable base stats?  I get that they were too strong at a time, but they got nerfed into being nearly unusable.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Iffem","date":"2015-01-29T05:31:42.751+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"at this point, it feels like Lee and Jarhead need to be {{champion:2}} 'd\nor better yet, {{champion:78}} 'd","replies":[{"poster":"Quepha","date":"2015-01-29T05:39:10.209+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Iffem,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=hqw6bEoR,comment-id=000f,timestamp=2015-01-29T05:31:42.751+0000)\n>\n> at this point, it feels like Lee and Jarhead need to be {{champion:2}} 'd\n> or better yet, {{champion:78}} 'd\n\nyou can't \"poppy\" a champion, the state poppy was in happened because they literally did nothing to her for years.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nublord","date":"2015-01-29T03:40:05.239+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"That's cool and all, but from what I have seen so far - you guys talk a lot about \"knowing\" there is a problem and \"working\" on it, but in the end nothing changes.
