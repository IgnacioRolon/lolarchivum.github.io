So let's talk here. :)\n\nRe-post of the basic questions: \n\nWith the continuing goal of making Support players have more meaningful gameplay and enjoy their choices throughout each game of League of Legends, we’re looking at making sure Sona feels as awesome as possible. \n\nThings that are already pretty awesome: \n\nSona’s role as a buff/enabler support is solid and rewarding.\nSona’s ult is impactful and allows Sona players to make big plays that they and their team can appreciate. \n\nThings that need to be more awesome:\n\nSona’s auras are powerful, but not satisfying to use, and create very little interaction.\nSona’s basic abilities don’t have as much skill expression as many other supports. \n\nThese are my current thoughts, as a dude who has been thinking about Sona gameplay a lot lately. I want you to tell me where I’m on track, where I’m wrong, and where I’m totally missing something. \n\nOther things I want to hear from you: \n\nWhat do you love about playing Sona? \nWhat do you not like about playing Sona? \nWhat decisions are most interesting to you when you play Sona?\nWhat moments of a Sona game make you feel like you’ve made a play for your team?\n\n\nEdit to fix my link.

Thanks for asking us. \n\nI really appreciate her auras, but I think you're absolutely right that they largely go unnoticed. I don't really think my carries are EVER thinking \"okay she's blue right now, so I hit harder\". Honestly, Sona's not thinking that either. She's thinking primarily that she needs to poke, heal, or speed folks up, and the auras are like icing on the cake. \n\nAgain, I love auras, but based on the direction Riot's gameplay philosophy is headed, I can see how they make less sense as a core part of this champion's power. If you'd like to try a small tweak without messing too much with the champion, I think the obvious place to look is at shifting power to her power chords. \n\nI have watched a couple of friends learn Sona after me, and one thing that always shocks me is how undervalued the green and purple power chords are. Blue just always seems like the better choice, especially for newer players. The truth is that green ones saves lives and purple ones secure kills, but they are much, much harder to time and implement than the very obvious, straightforward blue damage. \n\nCould it be possible to make those two choices more attractive? Cycling through chords is an essential aspect of good Sona play. It's delightful that you have players counting \"one two three, one two three, one two three\" on a musical champion - how perfect! So it seems natural to reinforce that element while also creating more variety in plays. It's also possible that slight visual reinforcement could help - the \"Minus DMG\" sign that Arcade Sona throws out with a green powerchord makes it more obvious that she just did something impactful. \n\nAs for what makes Sona so special, I'll refer to what my friends told me once. They said that in times of danger, when they hear Sona coming, they feel like everything is going to be alright. Just the sounds of those soothing chords inspires confidence - that's the fantasy of the bard character after all, isn't it? When they said that, it made my day. \n\nThanks again for reaching out to the community. Sona is a real gem League's cast of characters, and those of us who love her sincerely appreciate you keeping us in mind.","replies":[{"poster":"MakeYouSayYumYum","date":"2014-04-19T17:11:05.314+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"This all the way!! \n\nI'd also add: if/when they decide for a visual upgrade for Sona, they should look into her VFX and try to make them both more interesting and readable. As is, they're pretty meh. \n\nCrescendo, for example, while it's clear that it just went off because it has a large VFX, is really plain for a music character. Something along the lines of Arcade Sona would be cool (that skin really is the ideal for Sona in many regards for VFX). I'd also say that her Auras are so invisible because they only show up visually on Sona. Say if Sona is in Hymn of Valor, nearby teammates who are affected could have small blue notes play around them.\n\nIdeas for power chord readability: Show a slow-moving metronome above the enemy for E, and... not sure for W.

It definitely highlights a lot of the good and bad about Sona currently. One of the reasons this project is coming up is that Sona does have some really awesome parts of her kit, but they are sprinkled in with elements that are some of the most unsatisfying. \n\nYou are not alone in thinking that she does have some cool hooks that play up her being *the* musical champ. That's also something I'd personally love to see more of if we improved her kit. \n\nYou are also right, and it has been something that has been really present in this round of feedback, that many of Sona's problems are issues with what she does, but how we show that to players. We agree that some of Sona's choices in game as she exists now could be pretty solid if players were more aware of them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nintendan","date":"2014-04-19T12:28:59.175+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Oh my Lord this.\nJust this.\n\nReally good post and I never really thought about how rotating your spells for Powerchords in the middle of fights was so similar to counting \"like a metronome\".\nHer Powerchords and Ult are EXTREMELY fun and satisfying to use and I love it when your team capitalizes on these (like you said they're easier with Arcade Sona because of the awesome sprites that pop up) as you rotate through your spells to charge up for a W when Kha'Zix wants to turn on you or your E before Shyvana gets away.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Riot Whist","date":"2014-04-20T05:12:57.078+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"I would love our music champion to have timing based elements in her kit.\n\nI loved the early days of sona when it was okay to grab blue buff, it felt like guitar hero in a way as you wanted to hit the buttons perfectly as each skill went off CD.\n\n\nI feel that having actual timing based gameplay would be extremely unique and rewarding to play. Even something as simple as during her ult's CC tapping R to the correct rhythm would add extra ticks of damage or increase the duration slightly would be fun (but I'd like to go a lot further than that)\n\nThe main problem would be how lag might affect this, and making sure there is noticeable visual queues for hearing impaired players.\n\n\nJust an idea :)","replies":[{"poster":"Hyrum Graff","date":"2014-04-20T16:27:21.129+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":2,"body":"Disclaimer: I don't main sona (but I am a musician).\n\nHere's my idea for a sona rework.\n\n* Remove her auras.\n* Decrease the CD on sona's skills with level\n* Using sona's QWE in tempo (or as they come off cd, etc - something musical is all that's important) builds up stacks (up to a cap). Stacks decay over time.\n* The more stacks built up, the better sona's abilities (or, the stronger her auras).\n* Sona's power chord, instead of only triggering with 3 stacks, triggers no matter how many you have, but is more effective with more stacks. Triggering power chord consumes all stacks and scales with # of stacks consumed.\n* Using Crescendo also consumes all stacks; Crescendo is longer/wider/has a longer stun duration/has a faster travel speed based on number of stacks consumed (not sure which of these we should implement, I'll leave that to you).\n\nFirst, because sona no longer has auras, we can move a little power into her other abilities.\n\nSecond, now Sona has some decision-making to do (sona mains, hear me out - I know sona has decision making now, like which power chord to use). What I mean is that live sona, has no incentive to save her power chord. She wants to use it, then charge another one up so she can use it again. This sona has a decision to make: use my power chord, or keep my stacks so my spells will be more effective? Since there's a tradeoff to using the power chord, we can add a substantial amount of power into her power chords with lots of stacks. This will allow sona to make plays with her power chords.\n\nThird, Crescendo will actually feel like a (musical) crescendo. A crescendo doesn't just happen all at once.\n\n*you start quiet*\n###and build up\n##**until you reach**\n#**FULL VOLUME**\n\nLikewise, Sona shouldn't open with her r, it's something she should build up to.\n\nFinally, it gives some interaction to Sona's kit: Did she just use power chord or crescendo and it wasn't effective? Now she's weak (and squishy). Go kill her. Is she sitting on full stacks? Maybe now's not the time to go all-in (like the way you'd think about an Annie sitting on her stun).\n\nCheers,  \nHyrum Graff","replies":[{"poster":"Fearless","date":"2014-04-20T19:04:21.599+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"This was one of the first thoughts I had for the kit.

I definitely agree that there's this sort of history aspect of performing that this kit really hits on where past successes and mistakes can accumulate throughout the performance.\n\nHowever, I'm hesitant to say it'd be a good fit for Sona. Within the theme of maintaining Sona's skill floor, it might be hard to learn (or re-learn for that matter) \"how many stacks is enough stacks?\". Further, in terms of personality, I think Sona's theme is more a lead role where the focus is the melody rather than the timing. I think the focus should be on *which* ability to use instead of *when* (not to say that's not important).\n\nBut I'd definitely agree on the point that Sona abilities and lines could benefit from more meaningful references and less \"music gibberish\".","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Xelnath","date":"2014-04-19T22:40:26.543+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":4,"body":"Posting a random idea for ya, Fearless:\n\nCrazy idea - what if instead of having auras permanently attached to her, Sona created \"sound zones\".  \n\nE.g. circular areas of musical beats where allies ran faster, did more damage, healed etc?\n\nThen there's movement and counterplay to the effect's area?

While buff 'patches' are better gameplay than static auras, they still hold the problem of 'potentially-teamwide buffs that can all be in effect at once'. I feel that the healing and extra damage patches would be a little hard to appreciate, in particular - since they'd both have to be very subtle to remain balanced. A static movespeed zone, however, would be pretty interesting because it allows very high mobility, but only for the local goals of dodging skillshots, kiting around, and skirmishing.\n\nIf I may say so, Sona's auras have two main problems that force them to have weak effects:\n\n* Sona's cooldowns are very short; she can have literally all three of her auras up at once, and given sufficient mana, can have multiple auras up constantly.\n* Sona's buffs affect every champion in range, potentially affecting 5 champions (plus minions/pets).\n\nThe solution we came up with was this concept:\nWhat if Sona's auras were instead single-target buffs, similar to her W's single-target resistance increase? Furthermore, we could make the auras mutually exclusive, meaning she can have no more than one buff in effect at once. This would give Sona more meaningful choices and focus her power (AKA her buffs could be much stronger than the auras are now). However, it steals Sona's 'I'm helping everyone!' fantasy. To solve /that/, we considered the following change to Sona's ult:\n\n\n* Crescendo becomes Concerto. Sona uses her current ult (nerfed if necessary for power budget), and the next spell she uses within X seconds shares its buff with every champion in range.\n\nIt would be a pretty significant change, and I'd naturally want to prototype it and test it with more hardcore Sona players than myself, but I think it'd help move Sona in the right direction.\n\n(We also had some prototyped skill changes, like changing the active of her E from movespeed to 'Movespeed towards champions' that changes to 'Movespeed away from champions' during the second half of its duration, but that's probably best left to another post.)","replies":[{"poster":"Xelnath","date":"2014-04-20T04:46:49.082+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fascinating - how would you target who recieves the music?

The heal/defensive steroid picks the lowest-health target, the movespeed buff picks the slowest (or furthest-away?) ally, the damage steroid picks whichever one is closest to an enemy champion... This option's got a high potential for confusing allies and enemies who don't play Sona, though.\n\nI personally like the proximity-based choice, because I feel like Sona's positioning relative to her allies is a little irrelevant at present (compared to Thresh, whose positioning is very demanding).

She can just create her musical zones to siege a tower and then rest behind her allies. I imagine you could give her a maximum distance to the zone (like donger and his turrets) but: Make it too short and she would be forced to be really close, meaning that it would still be an aura since Sona is there. Make it too long and she would just create the zones and rest behind, winning assists and gold for doing nothing.\n- Case B is Sona's team is behind. Since she and her team would be forced to move a lot (since a normal TF would not be the best idea), creating a zone where her allies must stay at all times to receive it's benefits would be strange. Sona has a lot of mobility potential with her current E and Ancient Coin right now, but if you limit said mobility to a restricted part of the map, it would be really contradictory. Giving her low CDs could mean that she would create zones anywhere every 2 seconds. Give her high CDs and she will likely lose all mobility potential (unless the music zone is so big she can actually cover a really long distance until her CD reaches 0)\n\nSo, in case A you have: Either a rework of the auras into musical zones but she must be so close to them that they would still feel like her current auras or a Sona who can potentially benefit from just being behind her teammates (at least actual Sona must be with her allies, not far behind).\nIn case B you have a Sona who will probably will be under turrets most of the time, and she would probably lose her mobility potential that she has right now hanks to her current kit, since it would be limited to where she created the musical zone (too small and she loses it, too big and it would be the same as her current E aura).\n___\n\nAs i said at the beginning of my post, creating 'zones' its an interesting idea, but I don't feel like they would mix with Sona well, you could even make a new champion who is a painter and he would 'paint zones', and that would be even far more noticeable that 'music zones'.\n\nJust my thoughts, I know you guys have far more experience and knowledge than me but I feel that this idea is not the optimal solution to Sona and would also kill part of her musician trait. Music comes from the instrument and the player! Not a zone where she decided to make playback","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2014-04-20T04:02:41.559+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Xelnath, your idea makes zero sense on a logical level to me to the point you just broke my suspension of disbelief.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"HigeR","date":"2014-04-20T20:41:24.134+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Based on what you guys have said...

Perhaps this could be like Mantra too since you need power chord to poke in lane, so maybe at lvl 0 it can be activated as well.\n\nHer passive would become: **Ethwal Hero** (hehe) Sona plays a song indefinitely by holding down the key emanating an aura around her and sends out an spell when she releases it.\n\nThis would mean that her lingering auras would be weaker but holding down the key would give powerful buffs, for example for her W you could increase health regen around Sona, the rest remains the same but more powerful if held. When she releases the key, current spells happen, meaning she could just tap to enter into lingering aura mode, in this mode, only one aura can exist but when holding down the keys all 3 can happen at the same time (this would inquire into HUGE mana costs though).\n\nAnd now the cherry on top, at level 6 you can level up Power cord (her ult now) and will adquire: **Crescendo** When Sona presses 4 keys at the same time, she'll enter Crescendo mode, applying her current power chord choice and turning all her skills into Crescendo (kind of like Zyra's passive, when you die, all your skills become 1) when one key is pressed, she'll cast crescendo and go back into regular mode with ALL skills refreshed.\n\nTake in account that you can't cast crescendo mode if you're in CD, so you're better off holding down the keys one by one; Crescendo and Power chord have **no mana cost** though, so if you hold down the keys until almost manaless and then R you can apply a nice buff to your teammates while having a free Crescendo at yous disposal.\n\nSo this is my idea :P I think it would allow Sona players to experience something like Guitar Hero where you have to tap or hold the keys according to the situation. The downside would be the huge mana cost 3 auras would have and I think Sona would require some new particles :S","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nady","date":"2014-04-19T14:12:24.380+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":3,"body":"Posted this on the NA forums.  Gonna repost it here:\n\nMy opinion probably isn't going to be a popular one, but this is my take on it after maining Sona for my entire league career.\n\nI feel like Sona needs to be retuned as a mage support... Her skill set doesn't align her to being a protecting character like Janna and other traditional supports. She should be something along the lines of Orianna, Karma, and Annie instead of being a buff bot. Lulu is a better protector than Sona, and that says a lot considering Lulu is also a support/mage hybrid.\n\nHer auras don't feel rewarding, this is common knowledge. I wouldn't mind if they were taken out completely in return for meaningful AP ratios on her base skills and an increase in what her passive's power. Sona players should be rewarded for using their passive correctly. If her auras were taken out, it could be exchanged for a Q power chord that can poke decently into late game, a W power chord that debuffs an enemy harder, and an E power chord that slows more. Teammates should be able to say \"MAN SONA, if you hadn't hit the W power chord I'd be so dead\". Better visuals when enemies are hit with these chords would also influence the reward that Sona players and her teammates feel.\n\nThings that need to stay are her spammy playstyle and overall focus on positioning over worrying about where your mouse pointer is for use of your base skills. Having skillshots or smartcasted abilities like the new summoner heal would lose the feeling of Sona. She needs to be about perfect timing. The fact that her skill floor is low is ideal, it's that hitting her skill ceiling needs to be rewarded in a more visual way.\n\nTL;DR Take out auras, give AP ratios and buffed passive.

About the temporary Armor and Magic Resist, maybe the bonus should be a percentage and not a flat value (note: E already does this),\n\n* the E speed boost is too damn low at early ranks.\n\nOverall the auras are fine. Maybe the numbers could be tweaked, like less linear curves, but the gameplay around auras is very strong as is. It's simple and efficient and brings placement in the forefront. However the passiveness from auras doesn't feel very rewarding but that's also an issue with Aura-based items and in the end I'd say that's a matter of how you like to play a support character.\n\nTo my mind, the biggest issue with Sona's kit is Power Chord. It's very hard to play with. Not \"hard\" as \"needs skill\", though skill matters with this passive, but \"hard\" as \"painful\". What I'd like to see with this spell is a reaction to which spells were recently cast, not just the last spell. Basically Sona could have a stackable buff that gets one third of the current Power Chord effect and stacks up to 3 times. For instance if Sona casts W and then lands a basic attack, the enemy would receive a 7% damage reduction (1/3 of 20%) and 4 damage (1/3 of 13 at rank 1). If Sona casts W then W and lands a basic attack, the enemy gets 13% damage reduction and 9 damage (2/3 of 20% and 13). And so on. And if Sona mixes spells, the buff could be mixed as well. Then you could end up with combinations like QQQ>AA to be super aggressive or QEE>AA to be a bit aggressive and prevent the enemy from running, etc.. You could also ask yourself \"is it better to E>AA E>AA E>AA for moderate damage and sustained little slow or to EEE>AA for little damage and very strong short slow?\". It brings up interesting choices, granted the numbers are tweaked accordingly. About Q's Power Chord, I'd also prefer a debuff on the target (like Armor/MR reduce) instead of plain damage, it would bring Q's Power Chord useful to the team which is in phase with W's and E's Power Chord. Also a neat addition to this new Passive, a different melody could be played when the Passive hits the target, some sort of \"ta-da-da\" which changes with every combination. And when players will get used to it, they will hear \"dididi\" and say to themselves \"omg she hit me with the 40% speed debuff, I'm gonna be really slow for 2 seconds\".\n\nAs a last note, thank you for all your efforts so far.

Currently they only provide a small flat bonus for everyone, which is somewhat boring.\nExamples I could think of off the top of my hat:\n\nE: Aura movement increase works similar to {{item:3251}}, for everything else you have the active\n\nQ: Only gives an AP OR AD buff. Which one the target gets is determined by whether it has more AP or AD (a lot of AD? you get a´bit more!)\n\nW: Similar to Q but the amount is determined on the lower value of MR or armor (lacking armor? have some!)\n\nIf we use the current numbers, these iterations would be a nerf, freeing up power for more fun stuff.\n\nOr would these things be too complicated?\n\n- Would Powerchords that scale with skill level be an idea to think about? They are an interesting part of the kit, but the current iteration might make it problematic to simply buff them:\neasy to hit (AAs), and available at full strength with only 1 point in the skill. (Potentially frustrating for enemies in lane)\nAs of now they feel strong in the early game and seem weak later on.\n- I think supporting with Sona should feel like giving a concert.

It got me thinking over the last few days \"I really like Sona (Second favorite support!), but how can we make her Auras feel more impactful?\" This made me think of Nami! Remember when Nami was first released, and her E - Tide Caller's Blessing, felt underpowered because it was hard to appreciate it visually? Sona suffers from the same problem. The user and her allies can't appreciate or take advantage of the currently active aura because in the heat of battle no one can see it. If Sona's allies were given a visual indication of being affected by an aura it would feel more impactful. This is why I love Arcade Sona so much, and I think her visual queues could be taken further.\n\nYou will notice in the SonaWBuff1 picture, a giant red circle, along with my crudely drawn particle mock-ups under the allied champions. All of Sona's active abilities on all of her skills should have something like what appears in the Red circle. It's a better visual indicator of \"Hey, I'm getting buffed!\" The crudely drawn particles in on the ground in all the pictures is what should appear for the persistent aura (or something similar) so people can know \"Hey! I have X Sona Aura on me right now!\" This will help curb what we call invisible power, by giving her auras actually visual ques!\nI have more small ideas to help Sona feel more impactful outside of Ult plays, but I thought this was a good place to get the conversation started!

Here's my input.\n\nWhat do you love about playing Sona?\n\n- Juggling spells to get the right power cord off. \n- q + power cord q at lvl 5-9. It hurts quite a bit for a support.\n- Now that adc switched to attack speed quints, sona's lvl 1-2 poke becomes relevant again. Before that, adc would just life steal all the poke back at lvl 1-2.\n- Sona's non-ultimate spells are visually subtle, as I think they should be given her lore. The same point makes arcade sona unappealing to me.\n- The qwe active mechanics. Just need to be in range to cast. It has its unique feel compared to skillshots.\n- q and w,e have different ranges! This makes it more interesting than just getting to x range and spamming all 3 spells. The huge w range makes saving an almost offscreen ally pretty cool too.\n\nWhat do you not like about playing Sona?\n\n- I can't play her much since the advent of leona/thresh/annie near the end of s3. She's way too squishy against those champions.\n- Power cord w feels useless. It's hard to gauge when the 20% damage reduction would save someone. Hell, assassins most often will 1 shot the adc despite the reduction, so I tend to use power cord e instead to eliminate any chase/disengage potential afterward.\n- Crescendo feels slow to cast. I know I've whiffed a few of those. It feels more like a nami ult than a sej/amumu ult to me.\n- e's speed boost is hard to notice until I get >150 ap or lvl 18 (both of which are rare on a support). It's a one-point wonder for the power cord, but the active and aura are quite useless.\n\nWhat decisions are most interesting to you when you play Sona?\n\n- Look at what song am I currently playing and power cord count -> look at my cd's -> decide the order of spells to cast to get the right power cord off.\n\nWhat moments of a Sona game make you feel like you’ve made a play for your team?\n\n- Power cord e to catch or slow someone.\n- Big crescendo, with flash as bonus.\n\nOther\n\n- I'd like to be able to buff single allies with power cords.

Sona and her teammates will have to make many decisions about how clumped together they want to be (with the trade-off being susceptibility to AOE) damage. Also, this gives the opposing team the task of trying to spread Sona's team out so that she cannot be as effective, forcing Sona to choose between a weak aura for two carries or a strong aura for one carry and no aura for the other. The aura probably should grow somewhat exponentially so that it can be more easily \"felt\" by everyone.

The main thing that bugs me is that it's difficult to keep up with where the aura ends. I have to hover over my ability to see the range of it, but my adcs can't see it with me, so it negates any kind of interaction between the two players. Think of it this way: A player knows how to interact with Thresh's lantern because he/she sees that it is clickable. If there was a way to make the range visible to both Sona and nearby allies, sort of like how Morgana's ultimate range is visible to both her and those affected, I think that issue would be resolved.Perhaps not permanently display the range, as that would make positioning a bit too easy in respects to champion zones imo, but maybe once in a while or when she switches auras? It would prompt more awareness of what each aura's utility is. \n\nI also agree with some of the previous posts that it'd be nice if we could visually see the effects of power cord. \n\n**What I do like: **\n\nSona's Q does marvelous damage if you've got the build for it. Even after it was nerfed, the new support items allow for more aggressive rune and mastery builds on her, and it's great poke/harass if you know when the right time to trade is. (Not so much when you're out of position and going too ham, resulting in a massive hp drop)\n\nSona is a great champion to play with someone who isn't particularly comfortable with the adc role. Her bonus damage helps with CSing and trading, her heal allows for recuperation and resistance, and her speed up helps in chases and escapes. I once heard someone refer to Sona as a \"nursing\" champion, who gives a lot of room for mistakes on the adc's behalf. \n\n**\nDecisions to consider: **\n\nOne of Sona's greatest decisions is when she should go in an harass, and which aura is best  suited for this harass. \n\nOther considerations include which mana regen item to buy, because heaven knows she cannot just spam QWE all day long or she'll end up useless. Also, which gold item to buy. If I'm supporting an experienced adc, I will go for the spellthief, because the trades will be good. But if I'm with a passive or more inexperienced adc, I'll take the gold coin, and make sure I nurse them. (coughireallydontlikepassiveadcscough) \n\n\n**Play Making: **\n\nRight now I main Annie support. And I have to say I am in love with the \"FLASH ULT! DANCE MY PUPPETS!\"  approach. My two most fun poke lanes are Annie and Sona for that very reason. \n\nAlso, I love building Iceborn Gauntlet on her. Not sure if it's considered a \"play,\" but it does have a surprise factor (\"wtf a Sona with iceborn gauntlet?\" <-- I get that all the time). Since she has nice cooldowns, by late game I have enough mana regen and cdr from unholy grail to continually spam and slow enemies. \n\n\n\nSo that took me a while to answer, but there's my honest opinion!

I must admit, I'm a big aura player (going Paladin in Diablo 2 just for auras, elf in MU Online for buffing allies, bard in D&D, etc) and, as you can expect, I'm against removing or changing her auras into something else. I feel like that would kill part of what Sona is.\n\nAs I read your first post, I thought it was something like \"hey, let's do some minor changes to Sona, like indicators or something\" but the more I read the more I feel like there will be some big mechanics changes (sound zones, guitar hero mini game, passive rework, etc). Is that right? (I know they are just ideas, but I also saw a lot of interest into that).\n\n___\n\nAnyways, I though of something really simple for Sona (maybe someone posted it already), let's just separate her auras from her actives. \n\n- Keep the actives the same, but they not longer give you any aura at all. Instead of that, you must press R to enter her \"aura mode\", where you can choose wich one do you want to play. This allows Sona to choose between different actives and passives.\n\n- For example: Maybe I want to poke the enemy with Q, but also make sure I still give my ADC the armor and m. resist buff. This change would allow me to use my Hymn of Valor active to do some damage while also preventing some damage to my ADC with my Aria of Perseverance aura.\n\n- Once you select an aura, you go back to your \"active mode\". For not being stuck in \"aura mode\" if you press R accidentally, you can give a 2 or 3 seconds window where if nothing is pressed, it goes back to \"active mode\" automatically.\n\n- As for Crescendo, you just have to press R twice to use it, so there is no need to worry about losing her ultimate with this change.\n\n- Entering the \"aura mode\" would cost 0 mana and have no cooldown since I don't see why it should cost at all, and you could also split her mana cost between actives and auras (actual lvl 2 Q cost 50 mana, with this change it could cost 25 for the active and 25 for the aura, or maybe 40 the active, 10 for the aura, since the active having low cost would be too spameable).\n\n- Since there is the possibility of having separates actives and auras, that could also have different mana cost, would create some interesting choices \"Do I wanto to keep buffing my allies with damage while I use E to go faster? Or maybe it's better to do some damage while going for green aura to mitigate some damage for all?\". I think it can also make balancing easier, since you can tweek actives or auras without affecting the other at all.\n\n- Almost forgot, her \"enter aura mode\" (first R) is available at lvl 1, while Crescendo would still have to be unlocked at 6.\n\n**TL;DR:** Separate actives and auras with R\n\n- Press R once and you access the auras (Press R twice for Crescendo.)\n- You have the possibility to use an active like Q while playing your W aura (you do damage while also preventing damage into an ally).\n- You can balance actives and auras separately, like mana costs, different CDs for actives and auras, etc.\n- The kit would remain the same, but would also add some gameplay decisions to players. Choosing the right active and the right aura both would be more demanding and rewarding.\n- Sona players won't be mad with this (at least I think so).\n\n___\nI think that simple change can give you good results, or at least a good \"first step\" into a new direction for Sona: It's not much effort as a kit or ability rework (well, maybe it is, but at least her abilities are already coded), you shift some power to auras now that you can freely choose wich one you want to play regardless the active you use. All this without upsetting Sona players too much for making a big change to her kit.\n\nJust my idea, thanks for reading!\n\nP.S: If you go for a major change, please give her a different dancing animation.

Auras are generally viewed as boring and tend to be one of the first things to be scrapped. This shows in items as well (ex. the removal of mana-manipulator or WotA). So, if you want to shift power in Sonas kit around, one essential design question is: Do we follow the path of slowly removing all and every auras in our game or can we keep them while making them feel important instead of boring?\n\n\nThat being said, back to Sona.\n\nI like Sona because her voice is calming and pleasant to listen to.\n\nI like Sona because of her Pentakill Skin.\n\nI like Sona because it is a lot of fun to find the most effective way of poking your enemys out of the lane.\n\nI like Sona because of her unexpected kill potential.\n\nI like Sona because she focuses on supporting and enhancing the strengths of her WHOLE team, rather than focusing on a specific ally or beeing a CC machine.\n\nI like Sona because of all the diverse utility she brings to the table (Damage, Heal, Armor/MR bonus, Dmg reduction, speed up, single-target slow, Dance Party!)\nI like Sona because of \"the Plays\"!\n\nI like Sona because she can be easily picked up and played okay, but takes a good judgement of the situation to use her Auras to the best. On the offense? Q. Getting initated on? W. Chasing/Running? E. Laning? Q, for better last-hitting.\n\nI also kinda like Sona because nobody knows if she still has her legs o_O\n\n\nThings I don't like about Sona:\n-When you hit her ultimate and the enemys continue whatever as if nothing happend. This. Sucks. Alot.\n\n-Her W-Heal often doesn't heal who you want to heal. But i always thought of this as one of her drawbacks that you have to handle well in order to master her.\n\n-Since she is an aura support, it can be hard at times to protect a single person (your ADC) from the rest of the world. But also think of that as one of her (necessary) drawbacks.\n\n\nThat should cover the basics. I appreciate your intention of making Sona even more cool to play, but i can hardly imagine how. If you want to make her feel more impactful, maybe up the quality of her VFX?","replies":[]},{"poster":"vasheenomed","date":"2014-04-19T11:57:40.135+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think your right about Sona's auras being bad, but she doesn't have that big of a gap in skill expression, just her skill expression needs to be better defined. instead of skillshots and such, Sona's  skill comes from positioning, timing, and move order. she is fast paced decisions that really change whether people die or live. yes you can just spam spells, but being able to pick the right skill at the right time and place is more important on her than others, so I think that needs to be brought out more but it is there\n\n**What do you love about playing Sona? **\n\nher piano feeling, I always feel like I am playing an instrument and it's such fast paced play. she focuses on positioning, timing, and move order, rather than aiming of skill shots and things other champions require.\n\n**What do you not like about playing Sona?** \n\nher auras really make her feel weak even when ahead and feel completely pointless when behind, and also some of her spells don't have enough decision-making\n\n**What decisions are most interesting to you when you play Sona?**\n\nwhat order to use my spells in, how I can maximize my effectiveness with my next 2 seconds of positioning?

I think it adds timing and decisionmaking to her e which currently has none :/\n\n2. new second part of passive \"consecutive casts of same spell have x% more effect, stacking x times (or don't stack). since it is caused by the spell it can still use the same visuals/sounds, but it creates decisionmaking in \"do I want to use a different spell or do I want to keep my buff up\" and also gets rid of the power taken by her passive, overall keeping her aura sounds/visuals and getting rid of the auras would be best imo\n\nif you read this and have time please tell me what you think, would love a reply so much ;.; I have been thinking about this for so long","replies":[]},{"poster":"Acolon","date":"2014-04-19T08:01:44.193+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I do think she needs more interaction with the auras when certain conditions are met.\nAs for instance you mentioned on the US, her W heal is currently weak when saving someone, making it frustrating to dive with sona into a fight where the low amount of heal wouldn't make any difference. Even more when you see that Sona herself is topped off and still getting half the heals on herself, knowing that could've been more useful elsewhere.\n\nShe could need some sort of healing bonus, boosting the heal on the other champion when her own health is at maximum. Maybe even make the heal choose 2 allied champions instead of one ally and herself.\n\nBecause seeing the green numbers on me when I am topped off instead on someone else who is in need for those does feels like a waste.

This was what first drawn me into Sona. Sona essentially have three aspects: Her active ability, managing her Power Chord; and finally, the Aura component that as many have already said is the least appreciated and interactive. A bit more on specifics later, because first I'd like to explain the reason I first played and still continue to play Sona.\n\nAnother factor that led me to Sona was her lore. I'm a fan of Galio/Alistair/Quinn etc. styles of lore. Though, I do think that Sona's lore can be expanded a bit more, because her current goal to be in the League seems a bit weak. K, think I sidetracked a bit from the main topic here, but in my opinion, I think that a champion's lore actually defines who that champion is. It gives them their identity, their style, and most importantly, their purpose and gameplay. And again, being the silent orphaned child, it kinda makes sense that she would want to inspire hope and valor into people(and other creatures!) around her. But it seems a slight bit lacking. Is she suppose to be the background buffing her allies with her music? Or is she more of the active assertive character who wins the game for her team? As it stands(or float?) right now, I think her background music-buffing fits her silent but graceful personality.\n\nBy now, I think what you've said were spot on and the community have also already pointed out Sona's high and low end points. (Aura not really satisfying, active feeling bland, not quite reaching her potential, etc. etc.)\nAs for most interesting decisions and impactful moments? Good ults win teamfights. Correct Power Chords can also turn a dive around. And as many have said, she's also pretty versatile and works decently with the majority of ADC/marksmen and fits well in most team comps.\n\nFinally, here are some random thoughts:\n\n- Are Sona's all auto-targeting skills(besides ult) too easy to use and therefore are limiting her capabilities? Is it because as her opponent you can only dodge her ult so she needs to be weak and squishy as a form of counterplay?\n\n- Is her heal on a too low cooldown so its effects are weak? (The extra active bonus AR & MR makes it seem like it should be used similarly to Soraka's heal, but the travel time kinda delays it :/ [Maybe a fix could be instead doubles the passive aura resistances for 1~2 secs for everyone with activated?])\n\n- Her aura seems just there. Now I know auras should be \"just there\", but it would be kinda interesting if they were more than just just there.\n\n- Should Sona be super Aura girl, or be more active? Wasn't there this old thread where Riot mentioned Sona should've been the Aura maven or something? XD\n\n- And this is from that comment about positioning... So the closer you are, the louder they hear the music, and the stronger the effect? Meh just a random idea, and I think unclear intents on positioning will create the old Karma's kit issues...\n\n- Is her passive not really standing out visually and under-appreciated by allies? And also hard for opponents to predict which Power Cord she will use because all her basic spells share the same short cooldown? Is she not standing out because (besides being mute) of visual aspects?\n\n- Can Sona play two different songs at once? What happens if she mixes her songs together? What would happen when she finishes her musical performance? Wow, this sorta got me into remembering the \"QTrain\" that Scarizard/Wav3break was talking about in his Rengar rework thread XD\n\nOh! And, \"Sona’s role as a buff/enabler support is solid and rewarding.\"\nEnabler part is rewarding, but her buff numbers seem small... It's more like her debuff(Power Chord) that seems rewarding. It's also more of the active items I tend to buy (Mikael's, Locket, etc.) that seems to save my allies rather than just my basic skills.\n\nSo yeah, here are all of my \"notes\" heheh. Thanks for reading, and hope you guys can make Sona even better!! :)\n\nBy the way...

U don't even need particular timeing as all 3 skills have a very low cd.\n\nThe other problem is that most of her power is invisble, the 3 auras, the insanly strong E skill wich u only notice if u play against Sona, the W-Powercord, all pretty strong but hard to notice.  \nEspecially in clashes, the only real visible impact is ur ult, while ur auras have huge impact in clashes, u simply don't get statisfying feedback from them.\n\n\nHer Ult is great and definitly needs to stay, and her passive also feels pretty great, only W and E powercords need to feel more statisfying.\nWhile i think that both are strong enough and don't need buffs, the sure need more visual impact, s people notice their ass was saved by Sonas dmg reduce or they could catch that guy cause of the powercord slow.\n\nI think the 4 aspects sona should definitly keep is:  \n- strong poke  \n- good sustain  \n- depening on positioning  \n- vulnerable to all-ins  \n\nI think her auras need to go, and i'm not sure if the E spell should stay, as even the active part is a huge chunk of invisible power.\n\nHer Q and W could become skillshots, Q dmging all emeys in a line while buffing the dmg of ally in that aoe, W Healing all allys in a line and reducing the dmg or def-stats of enemys hit, so u get utillity out of hiting allys aswell as hitting enemys with her Q+W, so she can deside wich is more use, or try to position in a way that allows her to hit enemys and allys alike.\n\nwhatever u do, please make her Q+W+E more interesting to use, and also to play against.","replies":[]},{"poster":"arl949","date":"2014-04-19T05:41:39.914+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Whenever I play Sona i feel that the range on her kit is not utilized correctly. You are a super squishy support that unless you have your stun will most likely die if not positioned correctly. While this adds a potential to the champion it can be limiting in team fights and the player is really forced to play on the safer side. Consequently Sona is not often on the front line when she needs to hit her ult. This is where we get many of the flash ults that come into play.\n\nOverall, I think that her kit should maintain the skill for positioning, but as a champion she should utilize the fact that you she is not on the tankier side of the spectrum.\n\nI love the fact that her passive needs to be used with the correct aura for maximum efficiency, and while others complain that her poke is not strong, comboing a hymn of valor with a power chord at lvl 3 is extremely satisfying with the right build. Often I find myself not taking Song of Celerity until I am about to recall for the first time or until close to level 9. It doesn't contribute to her kit that much as a support other than the power chord. The movement speed is nice as it lets her postpone buying boots for longer than other supports, but in general I feel that during trades and engages she is always lacking a 4th ability, while other champions have that last ability to contribute to utility or crowd control.","replies":[]}]}
