Like goddamn I’ve tried everything to make it work even as far as changing cores and what not. Nothing helps. Honestly I want to play this game but if riot doesn’t give a damn about the few, then fuck it.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-07T20:29:59.281+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tech issues are definitely frustrating, I'm sorry it's happening to you.  :(  I really want to help you out, but I could use more info on what actually is happening.  What do you mean by crashing?  When is it happening exactly, and are there any error messages?  Let me know!","replies":[{"poster":"Morgoth Bauglir2","date":"2017-10-09T00:11:01.891+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"sorry for the rage, it's just infuriating to be put on leaver ban because of an app issue. but thank you for looking at this.  So when I start the game, it'll run for something like 3-35 minutes, and then my game freezes.  Shortly thereafter bug splat appears, I can no longer reconnect to the game, my computer says something about my computer's graphics card is no longer connected(which is wrong because other games work during this time), and my computer starts beeping very loudly, the lights begin flashing on my laptop, and then I have to force shut down to make it work. Again thank you for your work. Although I can play Aram, not Summoner's Rift. I'm not sure if this is due to the shorter game times or some other game function, i'm not sure. Thank you.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-10T15:54:03.836+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow that sounds awful.  :(  I'm really concerned for the state of your PC if it's behaving like this, and the beeping might be suggesting significant overheating.  Double check your vents to make sure there's good air flow, then hit us up in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) so our tech team can look into this with you directly.","replies":[{"poster":"Morgoth Bauglir2","date":"2017-10-11T17:15:50.201+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"damn. okay. well thanks again. for like, actually giving me non bs answers.
