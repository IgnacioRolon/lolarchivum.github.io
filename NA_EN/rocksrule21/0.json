Keep in mind you can only have up to 4 slots at any one time, and they unlock once per week. After checking your recent history, it looks like this might be the case. Shoot me a quick screenshot of your profile showing you have a slot open and I can see what I can do.\n\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/e40d8016ef43e10e98e7447eb0ca3689.png","replies":[]}]}
