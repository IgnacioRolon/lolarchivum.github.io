If you just started playing League of Legends today, it will take you 1,916 days (or 5.2 years) if all you do is play  one winning game a a day. And that is to get to the amount of champions we have right now. That&#039;s not even including Tahm Kench. \n\nLet&#039;s say the new player plays 4 games a day with a 50% win rate for 550 IP total. It would take them 870 days, or 2.3  years, to get to where we are now. That&#039;s almost 1800** hours sunk into the game at an exorbitant rate to be 2 years behind. \n\nNew players are starting extremely behind. This game is not new anymore. Riot can still turn a hefty profit while allowing new players to succeed.

Admittedly, my selection mostly included mid-priced (3150 and 4800) champions, with only one 450 and three 6300s, but the total cost of that champion pool is 60,000 IP.  A lot, but only a small slice of the half-a-million to buy all champions.\n\nAs for runes, I'd consider you to need at least these pages: AP mid / mage, AD champion, attack speed / jungler, support.  That's two additional runepages that you need to buy for 12600.\n\nFor essential runes, I'd say you need at least: AD marks, AD quints, flat health seals, scaling MR glyphs, flat AP glyphs, flat AP quints, attack speed marks, attack speed quints, gold-per-10 seals, gold-per-10 quints.\nThat shopping list is 32910 IP.\n(You could get that cheaper by not taking the gold-per-10 and swapping out the flat health for the cheaper flat armour seals.)\n\nThe total for my \"minimum runes\" setup is 45,510 IP, almost as much as my example \"decent champion roster\".\n\nI'd say most players will want more runes and rune pages than that, most likely at least one page dedicated to their main champion, and at least a few of the other rune types, including hybrid damage, mana regen, CDR, and flat MR.\n\nHaving more champions to play is nice.  It lets you try other things, or to swap in draft queues.  Yes, I can understand why this costs so much - it's to encourage players to spend real money to unlock the champions faster, and also to give players a sense of accomplishment when they get to unlock more champions through IP.\n\nHowever, having to sink such a huge amount of IP into just having the necessary runes to play effectively is harsh on new players.  They have to choose between the fun choice of unlocking a new champion, or the necessary choice of buying runes and runepages so that they can play their champions effectively.\nNeeding to buy runes also effectively makes the champions feel even more expensive, since players have less IP to spend on them when they need to buy runes.","replies":[{"poster":"Space Bum","date":"2015-07-05T19:30:21.452+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"My perspective on League has always been, \"you get what you pay for\"\n\nTake a traditional mmo for example.

A: 5.84 games per champ.\n\nThe issue with this line or thinking is that it implies new players have to collect every single champ ever made in order to enjoy the game.  And that's just not true.  If someone is a collector and enjoys getting everything, it doesn't seem unreasonable for that effort to take over 2 years.\n\nBy the way, I'm speaking as someone who starting playing in April.","replies":[{"poster":"disregardable","date":"2015-07-03T22:51:23.380+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"That was a really fair response. Upvote for you.\n\nThe problem, of course, is that it is **true** that players **do** have to spend more than a few games on 90-100% of the champions. Now it could only take 3 games of Renekton to 30 games of Kassadin to figure out that they don't work for me, but finding the champions I think would be fun means accessing them and playing them. \n\nI've been playing for a year now (anniversary was on the 18th last month!), own *just* over half of the champion pool, and right now I still have 10 champs on my wish list to buy (some of whom I haven't even gotten the opportunity to play with). \n{{champion:7}} {{champion:76}} {{champion:254}} {{champion:236}} {{champion:267}} {{champion:59}} {{champion:126}} {{champion:83}} {{champion:113}}  {{champion:35}} \n\nA lot of the fun in this game is experimenting with new champions, and I really do think newbies are being heavily denied that privilege for no reason other than Riot failing to update its unnecessarily costly system.\n\nAlso, by the way, 1800** (I was off on the math) hours is not a reasonable amount of time to collect 125 champions. Just going to flat out disagree with you there.","replies":[{"poster":"MVDuneCats","date":"2015-07-04T00:55:14.288+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=The AFK Farmer,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=mnPu0E77,comment-id=00120000,timestamp=2015-07-03T22:51:23.380+0000)\n>\n> A lot of the fun in this game is experimenting with new champions, and I really do think newbies are being heavily denied that privilege for no reason other than Riot failing to update its unnecessarily costly system.\n\nTo a newbie, every champ is a new champ, whether it's a 7800 IP Tahm Kench that has only been out a week, or a 450 IP Master Yi that has been in existence for over 6 years.","replies":[{"poster":"disregardable","date":"2015-07-04T00:56:22.046+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I said that statement with the context in mind.

Granted, real life gets in the way.  You can't always play when a certain champ is free to play.  And even if you can, sometimes you just want to play what you want to play, rather than be forced into trying out a free champ simply because you might not get the same chance again for 3 or more months.\n\nAn on-demand, try before you buy feature with some low cost (or no cost but really limited opportunity like Heroes of the Storm) would be better than trying to simply reduce IP costs across the board.  Because no matter how much you lower the price, people are still going to complain that it could be even lower.  And at some point, the cost is going to be so low that there's no perceived value in unlocking the champ.  And when that happens, the sense of accomplishment and progress for unlocking champs also diminishes.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Maximum Zilean","date":"2015-07-03T23:17:08.621+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would personally like it if there were champion IP sales, maybe even if they are 25% off their IP cost?

Sure it's possible, but if given a few more rune pages and my choice of runes I'd definitely be happier and might have climbed out of gold. I'm always confused by the league community (or the bit that posts on the forums) they always want every new player / every other player to play some sort of hardcore mode of league. What harm does handing out an extra rune page and a few free runes cause? What a person might try running scaling over flat once a while! \n\nThe horror.\n\nTldr; more runes and rune pages is more fun.","replies":[]}]}
