All quotes will be from your responses in the threads you linked.\n\n>that approach doesn't scale well with hundreds of thousands of posts per week. Let's say that you get 100k posts and 10% are posted in the wrong category. This is 10,000 posts that need to be moved, roughly taking 15-30 seconds to accomplish. Do the math.\n\nI just did the math.  This results in, according to your average time per deletion, 225,000 seconds per day of time spent moving threads. This is 3,750 minutes, which boils down to 62.5 hours per day of work.  Assuming an eight-hour work day, with 88% productivity (one hour per day not productive), that means you need 9 employees to handle the entire bulk of moderation in this regard.\n\nAssuming 1,000 posts per day (a more reasonable comparison to current activity) with the same ratios, a single full-time employee can handle the move requests in less than an hour 37.5 minutes).  How much less time does deletion take for this to be an impossible amount of time to overcome?\n\n---\n\nHere's something even more interesting.  Let's say that in this community there are 80,000 active posters creating this 100,000 post per day number.  Let's also assume that 0.1% of the population (one in a thousand) is a community moderator, and that each community moderator moves 12.5 posts a day (4.7 minutes of dedication) on average.  This means we have 800 community moderators, moving 10,000 posts a day.  \n\nUsing our previous numbers, this means that our slice of community moderators is handling the entire volume of move requests.  For free.\n\n---\n\nHow many posts a day is the Boards platform handling, currently?  Out of those posts, how many of them are removed for being in the wrong section?  Is the platform being advertised to attract more people to make this 100k number realistic?\n\nWhy is it taking 15-30 seconds to move a post, but it takes significantly less time to delete?  Moving should, in theory, be a bit of scrolling and a single extra click.  3 clicks vs 4 shouldn't be such a huge disparity that it's impossible to maintain.\n\nMost importantly, if your community is 100,000 people on a forum, you **need **to have community moderation presence.  This is basically non-negotiable, as it's impossible to pay enough people to handle that sort of volume without going bankrupt.  These community moderators would be well-equipped to move threads, and it's actually *less* risky to have them moving things than deleting them.\n\n> If we went around moving everything that was posted incorrectly, the mods wouldn't have time to do anything else, and it would create a situation where we have lopsided participation with a majority of the traffic on one or two boards. Get onboard!\n\nI'm missing the logical step here.  Your moderators currently go around deleting everything that's posted incorrectly; do they have time to do anything else, and does moving take that much longer?\n\nAlso, why would this result in lopsided participation whereas deletion doesn't?  If topics are accurately and efficiently moved, activity shouldn't be transferring between boards where topics differ.  The reason General Discussion was such a problem was that there was almost no moderation presence with moving threads correctly.  Additionally, almost the entirety of Riot posters used GD at the exclusion of all other boards.  This is not a problem with the concept of moving threads; this is a problem with policy.\n\n>The moderators found your post in Live Gameplay Balance several hours ago. They deemed it to be in the wrong board (which it was) but decided to leave it because it was well written, constructive, and already had a lot of visibility.\n\nI have mentioned this before, but this is very inconsistent.  Why is a thread with visibility treated differently than one without if the goal is to keep the boards separated?\n\n---\n---\n\nWasn't the character limit supposed to be raised?
