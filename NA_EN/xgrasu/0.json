Me and alot of other people included are still having FPS problems. Even people with insane specs are getting the same problem. First you start the game with 200+ fps, the longer the game goes it will drop down to 60 and it cant even stay at 60 because in teamfights it will even drop to 30. This has been going on for the last 4 patches and it really turns off alot of players including me. No dust on my fans, did a clean install, reinstalled drivers, cleaned registry, tried everything from the site. NOTHING seems to work. So I really hope you guys are gonna look into this a bit deeper than saying it could be and individual problem because that would be odd if a shitton of people suddenly have local problems since patch 7.1 till 7.6.","replies":[{"poster":"TrampledByWeed","date":"2017-05-11T18:29:53.991+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"and it's still going on because riot doesn't give a fuck","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Yeongsaber","date":"2017-03-27T10:53:41.797+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes ive also performance issues right now!! gtx 970 and got average 80-140 fps -,-","replies":[{"poster":"Copious Fred","date":"2017-06-30T00:24:23.839+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Still same problem.

During the game (while in loading screen) press ALT+ TAB and open task manager - right click LOL and click on properties - go to compatibility and set to run as Windows 7....assuming you got WIN 8 or 10.\n\nThat fixed it for me!
