For example when you do the animation taunt she would do a backflip and land on her gun, in my case she does the backflip holds the gun in her hand and stands in the air.\r\nI don&#039;t know if the other skins have this problem too, but i do checked with the basic skin and there was no problem, only with the Riot Girl skin.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-07-28T00:14:55.126+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hiya! \n\nThanks for the report!

It's pretty huge, since the gun is like 60% of her, but oh well. I eagerly await this fix. Probably one of my favorite skins in the game.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-07-29T16:21:11.638+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're right, her weapon is a focal point! However, since this isn't gameplay impacting (as it's appearing on her emotes/idle/death), it doesn't need to be disabled/hotfixed.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Maszter","date":"2015-07-28T22:49:31.365+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As long as it gets fixed, the method and the time doesn't really matter.
