Idk what happened to them but I was permanently banned... I&#039;ve been chat restricted once for 10 games earlier this year, and I get permanently banned for my next punishment? There&#039;s people who get tons of warnings, bans, and ranked restrictions, but here I am getting the whole hammer after 1 game of being toxic. I haven&#039;t even gotten an email yet either. Hopefully Riot comes to attention and what I&#039;m hoping for is anything but a perma ban, Ill have to say bye to a lot of friends and money Ive spent on this game.\r\nNote: I was literally banned within 5 minutes of exciting this game and the chat logs I get when I try to relog is only 2 games where one of them I wasn&#039;t even toxic in. The chat restriction had 3 games to justify itself behind.\r\n\r\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"Powderkegg","date":"2016-07-27T01:53:37.315+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Post the logs","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2016-07-27T01:56:08.842+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And explain where you're talking to your friends vs others.","replies":[{"poster":"Trash Trundle","date":"2016-07-27T01:58:14.778+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Game 1\nTrash Trundle: lol may b\nTrash Trundle: guess he knows i jung now\nTrash Trundle: it works for allies too btw\nTrash Trundle: same\nTrash Trundle: grab when u can\nTrash Trundle: just grab ali if u can\nTrash Trundle: pl0x dont steal\nTrash Trundle: hard enough when you are so passive to get gold\nTrash Trundle: i had that skin\nTrash Trundle: go drag\nTrash Trundle: sej bot pls\nTrash Trundle: bout to take ti\nTrash Trundle: good thing you blocked that ult man\nTrash Trundle: cool\nTrash Trundle: love being front line\nTrash Trundle: no wonder my ping was shit\nTrash Trundle: i had netflix and 2 youtubes open\nTrash Trundle: k same\nTrash Trundle: have\nTrash Trundle: *\nTrash Trundle: get it\nTrash Trundle: what\nTrash Trundle: lol\nTrash Trundle: not gonna be front line cuz your to pussy to\nTrash Trundle: remember yoru tank\nTrash Trundle: im adc\nTrash Trundle: because i wouldve gotten 1  shot\nTrash Trundle: like you did\nTrash Trundle: wouldnt have gotten sivir if i didnt do that\nTrash Trundle: dont tp mid fight\nTrash Trundle: come when ur done\nTrash Trundle: end\nTrash Trundle: may b\nTrash Trundle: spawnkill\nTrash Trundle: and end\nTrash Trundle: k walk over my trap\nTrash Trundle: ult out\nTrash Trundle: uh\nTrash Trundle: just tp\nTrash Trundle: dont tp mid fight\nTrash Trundle: best way to throw\nTrash Trundle: come\nTrash Trundle: now\nTrash Trundle: alistar back\nTrash Trundle: fucking retarded malz\nTrash Trundle: can you fucking tp already\nTrash Trundle: like jesus\nTrash Trundle: told you\nTrash Trundle: told you\nTrash Trundle: best way to throw games\nTrash Trundle: you couldve just been there prepared\nTrash Trundle: suck me\nTrash Trundle: this is my build i play vs plats where there arent retards like malz\nTrash Trundle: too bad you didnt give it up because i got it lol\nTrash Trundle: blitz doesnt know how to grab either\nTrash Trundle: see blitz\nTrash Trundle: your too scared to be front\nTrash Trundle: ur tank for reaosn\nTrash Trundle: cuz siv is retarded\nTrash Trundle: funny\nTrash Trundle: free elder\nTrash Trundle: not tank\nTrash Trundle: they gonna get drag\nTrash Trundle: have to force\nTrash Trundle: drag last longer i think\nTrash Trundle: sorry guys im retarded\nTrash Trundle: same\nTrash Trundle: hgurry\nTrash Trundle: gorou\nTrash Trundle: if he gets caught its gg\nTrash Trundle: jesus","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2016-07-27T02:01:59.451+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Just going to repost my comment under this one now...\n\n\nI mean, it looks toxic, but not permaban toxic.
