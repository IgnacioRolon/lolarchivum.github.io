Do we have any supports who really build AD atm? No. \n\nPyke was already revealed as some sort of support. And following some other potential \"leaks\"; Pyke will be the following:\n\nMain Role: Support              Sec. Role: Assassin\n\nPassiv: some sort of bonetooth necklace {{champion:107}} has\n\nUltimate: some sort of execution-spell (&quot;keep your health high&quot;) like {{champion:122}} has. But i will give all teammates who assisted extra {{item:2319}} \n\nThe other abilites will be\n\nsome sort of stealth/burrow like {{champion:421}} \n\nsome sort of  stun-ability - maybe a mix between {{champion:107}}&#039;s net and {{champion:412}}&#039;s hook\n\n\n\nWhat do you think? I know we will know it soon enough, but i am curious and some of these leaks/infos seem to be legit.\n\n-and yeah, i forgot one ability. Maybe some of you know it?","replies":[]}
