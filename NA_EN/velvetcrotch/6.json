God King Darius has the most particles and looks far more superior to be a gem-skin.\r\n\r\nThat&#039;s my honest opinion and i do think many share this too. \r\n\r\nThanks for making this - more fantasy - skins and even give Garen his first more serious skin (beside his lion who looks cool, but his a but cringe) \r\n\r\n{{sticker:sg-ahri-2}}","replies":[]}
