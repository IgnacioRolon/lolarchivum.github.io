I know dudes like Zed counter him. But when i e.g. pick Galio (who has much magic res) or Ziggs and locks Brand in after me - he literally destroys me with his OP passiv.\n\nAnd yes, i even try to sidestep his W.\n\nEdit: And i know Ziggs isnt melee, but has very low mobility (like brand, but with less burst)\n\n> **Edit 2: ** BIG thanks to everyone who answered below! There are some really helpful ideas!!

You can farm/poke from fog with Bouncing Bomb (Q) in this match up and zone him with Minefield (E) if he steps towards you. Always Save your Satchel Charge (W) if he slips past your (E) so you can avoid him.  Your end goal here is to clear the wave as fast as you can, out sustain him, and take the tower. Avoid fighting, you will blow him up, along with his entire team, late game.","replies":[{"poster":"VelvetCrotch","date":"2018-05-25T02:31:08.474+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not a mid-main, but Ziggs is one of my fav midlaners. I just like this char overall, but its like playin just sometimes Zed: you get very rusty.

The Brand will assume you are going for the farm and will try to get free harass. \n\nAt this point, if you are using this method on a front line minion or a minion you have drawn aggro close to your tower, you can abuse the cooldown of his W and then attack.
