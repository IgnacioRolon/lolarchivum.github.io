This one doesn't make any sense.\n\n> - to avoid the problem of going too extreme with the themes by giving her much armour > Morg should be nearly naked than and this could be a problem\n\nWhy in the world would giving Kayle some armor mean that Morg would have to be naked? This one isn't literally nonsense, but it's illogical.\n\n> - to make it visually more appealing > it just looks better when a woman with wings and attacks RANGED doesn’t wear too much armour. Heavy armoured Archers are only a thing in Skyrim as far as I know lol\n\nThis is two in one. First, yes, she is more \"visually appealing\" in that an attractive woman generally has more opportunity to be \"visually appealing\" when you can see more of her, also known as \"sex sells.\" Second, Kayle swats things with a sword, and can only do that from range later in the game.\n\n> to show ppl and enemies that she is a none human being and stronger than normal humans and ordinary heroes.\n\nOf course! How would we know that she's a powerful champion if she was _too clothed_?\n\nOverall, your arguments were disappointing at best and ludicrous at worst. Removing Kayle's armor was a terrible decision.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Glîtchy","date":"2019-02-19T09:46:34.044+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"honestly I don't like how they gave her those tiny af wings, like c'mon riot","replies":[]}]}
