And even its a fictional character i immediately noticed her BIG cleavage.\n\nEven i wouldn&#039;t complain as a straight guy and grown man, i wonder why it&#039;s okay that Vayne has it but Camille not in her latest skin?\n\nand no, i am not alone. others recognized the subtle change too. --&gt; \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/9wtcgq/with_the_pbe_update_they_have_nerfed_coven/\n\nSo my solution to this is:  give either Camille&#039;s skin her cleavage back, or reduce it on Vaynes. Easy as that.\n\n(Btw i would like to know why you even changed it for Camille, ty)\n\ngreetings\n______\n\n**Edit:** Cause some seem to not understand my point i expain it as short as possible cause i didn't thought its that hard to understand (but maybe its cause i am no native speaker):\n\n**i didn't complain about they show too much skin. it's the other way around. its a fictional game with digital champions. and yet Riot removes here and there skin just cause of some loud crying dudes on... reddit or whatever i guess. instead of let the fantasy be.**","replies":[{"poster":"GreenLore","date":"2019-01-13T11:22:03.934+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Phridolin,realm=EUW,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=JRK7kKYr,comment-id=,timestamp=2019-01-10T04:07:04.971+0000)\n>\n\n> So my solution to this is:  give either Camille&amp;#039;s skin her cleavage back, or reduce it on Vaynes.

But I like that not all female champs are full fanservice anymore.","replies":[{"poster":"VelvetCrotch","date":"2019-01-13T22:41:32.337+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But Vayne is a damn serious and badass huntress and no MF. oO Imo it  doesn’t make sense to give her that massive cleavage -  on the other hand... she has a pig in her crossbow...\n\nppl who argue that Camille doesn’t deserve cleavage cause it doesn’t fit her Charakter or cause she is old... I just have to laugh out loud. Lisandra is old zoo yet she has a big cleavage in one of her skins. Why does an old lady not have the opportunity to wear an outfit with massiv cleavage? What’s wrong with that? (Beside she doesn’t look like that) \nAnd it’s just her Chroma Not her base.\n\nI really question the sanity of some ppl.\n\nBut thanks for your comment was polite and thoughtful.
