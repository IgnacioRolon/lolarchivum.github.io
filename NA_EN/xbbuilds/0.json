The quick fix is to hop into your installation folder for League (C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends) and *delete* the **LeagueClient.exe** file before launching League from the **lol.launcher.admin.exe** file in the same folder. Be sure to right-click and launch the application as administrator.\n\nLet me know if this resolved your issue.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sassmast3r","date":"2016-12-24T06:05:37.073+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I would advise sending a ticket to Riot, as this seems serious and imperative that it be fixed.
