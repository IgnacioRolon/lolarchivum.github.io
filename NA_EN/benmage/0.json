I fully accept my responsibility, but would love to see the games. (unless im missing a link somewhere)\n\nI never bitch at anyone for doing poorly.. never racial, I trudge thru the trolls and afkers as we all do.. but when someone does talk trash I have a bad tendency of getting involved.. Probably just because I don't see mute as a viable option in a \"team\" game, but I digress... suspension is what it is... I guess I go troll bronze on alt, lol.(kidding, mostly)\n\nEdit: Thank you keyru, I followed your instructions.  Unfortunately it is what I figured it would be.  The worst getting away with it.  The constant ruining of games by trolls, afkers, racists and immature people who hide behind computer screens takes its toll on the people who follow the summoners code and casually wish to play this game simply for fun.  \n\nLike I said I can delve into.  In this cut that was emailed to me, they only show my dialouge.. WHYs that?  If we're trying to avoid context issues I can't even see.. Oh its the \"don't say anything\" suggestion.  Zzzzzzz.  So thats the basic answer... fine.. better for me to shutup, not try and win a team game and let the trolls ruin the game and have it their way.  A damn shame riot caters to trolls.  \n\nHeres the cut of my dialogue.  It takes me nearly 10 minutes to figure out that Ali, and Kayle were a preformed duo that wanted to go Kayle and Ali botlane.  Never was this mentioned that they were a duo or that Kayle was going botlane in the pregame chat.  So on my pick I picked EZ adc, after talking to everyone else in the que. (and I dont adc I main mid by far 2nd supp... but anywhose)\n-First I think Kayle is trolling, I so try and salvage game by having Ali come top with.\n--Then Im more confused at why Ali is helping troll Kayle...\n---Finally I figure out I'm the dunce and it's a duo troll.\n---Naturally my frustration and confusion of being top to bot adc to all over the place causes me and the team to fall behind.  Kayle I remember being that guy who claims he's smurfing and will carry, but blames me for his failure...zzzzz so Yeah I get sucked in  Enjoy:\n\nGame 1:\n[0:14] Benmage (Ezreal): kaylke u trolling?\n[0:22] Benmage (Ezreal): ali lets go top\n[0:28] Benmage (Ezreal): ali come top\n[0:29] Benmage (Ezreal): ali\n[1:25] Benmage (Ezreal): ali come top\n[1:44] Benmage (Ezreal): ali come on\n[1:46] Benmage (Ezreal): gonna get behind\n[1:51] Benmage (Ezreal): no..\n[2:43] Benmage (Ezreal): ali\n[3:00] Benmage (Ezreal): im coming bot\n[3:11] Benmage (Ezreal): im the adc\n[3:34] Benmage (Ezreal): no\n[3:39] Benmage (Ezreal): kayle can\n[3:59] Benmage (Ezreal): no i cant lol\n[4:19] Benmage (Ezreal): im the adc\n[4:23] Benmage (Ezreal): u tell hiomcome on\n[4:25] Benmage (Ezreal): enuf\n[4:35] [All] Benmage (Ezreal): report kayle\n[4:55] [All] Benmage (Ezreal): kayle wont top\n[6:44] Benmage (Ezreal): ur the troll kayle\n[6:51] Benmage (Ezreal): im adc\n[7:03] Benmage (Ezreal): no i picked before u\n[7:05] Benmage (Ezreal): and said im adc\n[8:03] Benmage (Ezreal): wtf\n[8:08] Benmage (Ezreal): ali why u folowing him..\n[8:10] Benmage (Ezreal): come with me\n[8:17] Benmage (Ezreal): wtfff alui???\n[8:24] Benmage (Ezreal): IM ADC\n[8:30] Benmage (Ezreal): this fucking game...\n[8:31] Benmage (Ezreal): wow\n[9:02] Benmage (Ezreal): this is so fucking dumb this duo reported\n[9:07] Benmage (Ezreal): didnt say shit\n[9:12] Benmage (Ezreal): till forced me adc solo\n[9:13] Benmage (Ezreal): wtf\n[12:11] Benmage (Ezreal): i didnt know u 2 were duo\n[12:34] Benmage (Ezreal): seriously\n[12:38] Benmage (Ezreal): i wulda just picked top\n[12:58] Benmage (Ezreal): no\n[13:28] Benmage (Ezreal): u had kayle a top\n[13:30] Benmage (Ezreal): saying bot\n[13:33] Benmage (Ezreal): i thought uy trolling\n[13:37] Benmage (Ezreal): uy didnt say duo\n[13:38] Benmage (Ezreal): or adc\n[13:48] Benmage (Ezreal): then say aduo\n[15:36] Benmage (Ezreal): ur not carryin much\n[15:48] Benmage (Ezreal): and what makes u the god authority i picked before u\n[15:52] Benmage (Ezreal): say duo nexttime\n[16:44] Benmage (Ezreal): cuz u did much\n[17:02] Benmage (Ezreal): wow\n[22:20] Benmage (Ezreal): this duo is useless\n[22:37] Benmage (Ezreal): u2\n[22:38] Benmage (Ezreal): for being quite\n[22:50] Benmage (Ezreal): lol\n[24:43] Benmage (Ezreal): lol me\n[24:46] Benmage (Ezreal): ur the terrible ones\n[24:51] Benmage (Ezreal): i said mid pref can supp\n[24:56] Benmage (Ezreal): and look whatr happened\n[25:01] Benmage (Ezreal): u force corki mid...\n[25:06] Benmage (Ezreal): and this duo doesnt say shit\n[25:12] Benmage (Ezreal): what u got is their fault\n[25:17] Benmage (Ezreal): or ur own\n[25:20] Benmage (Ezreal): no u didnt\n[26:07] [All] Benmage (Ezreal): fucking duo troll\n[26:16] [All] Benmage (Ezreal): duo didnt say shit\n[26:25] [All] Benmage (Ezreal): alui kaykle\n[27:20] Benmage (Ezreal): u2 too\n[27:22] Benmage (Ezreal): toxick as fuck\n[27:27] Benmage (Ezreal): i didnt do shit\n[27:32] Benmage (Ezreal): lol makin my point\n[27:35] Benmage (Ezreal): lol\n[27:39] Benmage (Ezreal): says the 1-6\n[27:40] Benmage (Ezreal): i main mid\n[27:56] Benmage (Ezreal): kaylke speak up\n[27:57] Benmage (Ezreal): stfu\n[28:16] Benmage (Ezreal): haha\n[28:54] Benmage (Ezreal): moreover u2 never grpo\n[28:57] Benmage (Ezreal): yolo duo\n[29:48] Benmage (Ezreal): its been free with this duo\n[30:01] Benmage (Ezreal): so fucking useless\n[30:04] Benmage (Ezreal): kayle thinks hes a smurf\n[30:06] Benmage (Ezreal): thats fuynnny\n[30:15] Benmage (Ezreal): dude ur terrible\n[30:18] Benmage (Ezreal): what u smarfing\n[30:20] Benmage (Ezreal): for bronze\n[30:33] Benmage (Ezreal): no u arent\n[30:42] Benmage (Ezreal): smurf for bronze i guess","replies":[{"poster":"Keyru","date":"2015-03-31T23:40:11.990+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"We understand that context is key to helping reform behavior and with the Tribunal in extended maintenance, the temporary systems do not have the power to provide chat logs like the Tribunal used to do with reform cards.
