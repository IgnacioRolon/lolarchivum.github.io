I'm hardly surprised it got downvoted, especially when people mistake the downvote button for a disagree button. Given what information OP has given us, it is equally likely that he genuinely believes one or more of the individuals on his team to be mentally sick and if they were treating him poorly enough, that is an adequate response. How exactly is that an insult? Telling someone they could be mentally ill isn't an insult. Oh, so we can't say that because it might hurt their precious little feelings, even if it could be a genuine problem that requires said individual to seek psychiatric help? The audacity of people on this board to think that every single person who posts threads here is some sort of lowlife scumbag makes them just as insufferable as anyone saying the \"R word.\"\n\nTo be honest, I'd be more bothered by that if the very people in this thread didn't immediately try to put words in his mouth and blame him for calling someone the \"R word\" even though he didn't (that's a stupid phrase btw, r%%%%%ed used to be a medi%%%%%erm as well). I also have no idea why we're following Riot's rules for communication when they can't even live up to those rules in their own workplace.\n\nI couldn't care less about downvotes on this board. Their habits not just in this thread, but other threads too speak for themselves well enough.\n\nOh btw, yes I did notice that one person following all my posts and downvoting every single one of them.
