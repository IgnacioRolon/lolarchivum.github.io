Second in terms of top laners, tryndamere can only beat people who are brain dead. Your post is talking about tryndamere operating at maximum efficiency. pulling everything off perfectly, and No ONE stopping him. Many times as tryndamere ive just been cc'd through the entire duration of my ult, in teamfights of course if the enemy undrestands \"hey we shouldnt let this guy just stand on top of us\". Generally in 1v1 scenario's you should try to fight him if he isn't behind because HE IS A DUELYST one of those people who excel in 1v1's. If you do find yourself fighting him it shouldnt be a problem to keep him at arms length because if he E's on you thats a perfect opportunity to cc him. he wont be able to auto you while cc'd and you can then ut enough distance to  stay out of his auto range (its 125 the lowest in the game) If you're a ranged adc like ashe or something then you  should properly know how to kite, so dodging tryndamere's slow by simply turning around isn't hard in itself. ALSO on the topic of his slow which also lowers your ad You will NEVER HAVE TO DEAL WITH IT unless you're getting to late game because Tryndamere maxes W last. and even then 85 late game is just the loss of 1 of your 6 items for 4 seconds. Tryndamere is a squishy champion to compensate for his ult. If they did something like completely gut his ult, he wouldn't even exist on the roster because he'd be such a bad champion, they'd have to give him buffs out the ass to make him worth playing instead of solo carry riven or renekton","replies":[{"poster":"smalppuser","date":"2019-09-04T23:04:47.206+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Aatrox Airlines","date":"2019-09-05T00:09:32.116+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"That doesnt happen unless you make a giga fuckup","replies":[{"poster":"Ragnaveil","date":"2019-09-06T02:06:30.910+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean, he can just make any mistake a giga fuckup tbh.
