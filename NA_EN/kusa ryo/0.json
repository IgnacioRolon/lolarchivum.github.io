For god&#039;s sake, I _accidentally ulted._\nBut they reassured me it was all right.\nNot a single time during that game was a harsh word even directed at me, nor was it directed towards the other solo-er nor towards each other (i had asked previously if they were using a communication system like skype so i would know to follow if only a single one of them pinged).\nI had literally just asked them to flame me.\nI really needed it. I&#039;ve been so used to being flamed by a team that I&#039;ve practically been better at functioning with flamers than functioning with such an angelic premade.\nWe eventually won that game. I was able to soon turn my score around, from a 0-4-0 to a 1-6-16.\nIt may not look much, but the whole point that I was able to turn my score around just _that little much_ was nothing short of a miracle.\nThe best part---They honored me.\nI told them I loved them and i wished them the best of luck their next coming games. But when i exited the post-game lobby, I found this little gem.\nOne honor from each of the premades.\nOne honor from each category.\nKnowing that there are people, let alone premades, like that in this world gives me hope.","replies":[{"poster":"Finally","date":"2016-08-05T00:20:51.907+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":58,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Wind Whistler","date":"2016-08-05T01:37:05.048+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Weave Game,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=eQVzpVU3,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-08-05T00:20:51.907+0000)\n>\n> Who cares, its called being fake nice, they just wanted to win, and only honored you because you turned ur shit around.\n\nI hope you're being fake mean.","replies":[{"poster":"Arakadia","date":"2016-08-05T02:24:15.617+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://cdn.meme.am/instances/400x/60726641.jpg","replies":[]},{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2016-08-05T08:25:42.058+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"While I do agree that there is a lot of fake nice in this game, the honors were clearly genuine (as there's no benefit to being nice _after_ the game).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Zarvanis","date":"2016-08-05T01:01:45.371+0000","up_votes":29,"down_votes":1,"body":"http://gif-finder.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/B.J.-Novak-Does-It-Matter.gif?noredirect\n\nI'll take fake kindness over salty children any day.","replies":[{"poster":"Volcanuz","date":"2016-08-05T13:50:00.605+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thiiiiiiiiiiiiiis son.\n\nEven if it annoys or pisses you off.
