Twisted Fate's life and skills in the lore.\n\nI think TF is a very very great champion and i very like him and to play him :)\nI think there is place for gameplay improvement too.\n\nTF's passive could have to do with the dagger he stole in Bilgewater, maybe it's got a special effect since TF wanted it so much. Edit: or perhaps a bounty hunting for the enemy with the most gold every 5 mins?\nHis Q could be flipping a table over and make rain cards and gold and parchment in an aoe.\nHis W should remain untouched in my opinion mostly cause i have no better idea.\nTobias's E could be a set trap that lets him teleport to it (like a Zed shadow that can't use skills but lasts like 10 seconds). Can use once every 25/22/19/16/13 seconds.\nHis R could be the same, i have nothing better going in my mind now. Edit: His ultimate, instead of teleporting him basically anywhere halfway the map, could be a trigger that deactivates ALL ENEMY IN-BUILT PASSIVES. (Teemo's E and Camouflage, Quinn's Targeting passive and atk speed bonus on W, reset Rengar's stacking bone passive to 0, and so on for all passives). I think it would bring a new and fun mechanic to the game.\nUsable only every 120 seconds at all levels, cannot be reduced by cdr.\n\nNote this is just a suggestion but i think TF would get more viable this way with all those champions with insane mobility.\n\nTF is cool and great, love him. Give it some thoughts please :)\n\n\nFor the people commenting: i don't want to see any hate, didn't create the topic for that. Respect is due here.\n\nHave a nice day everyone.","replies":[{"poster":"DaybreakGenetics","date":"2015-11-26T22:34:27.005+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Edited the post. Please if you don't like my post don't thumb it down, just ignore it. \nIt's adressed to the creation & rework team in Riot anyway.  I'm trying my own way to make the game better. Yes i'm Bronze, yes i'm bad, and yes i have ideas. No hate.","replies":[]}]}
