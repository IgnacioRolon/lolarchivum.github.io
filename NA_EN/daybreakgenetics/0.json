There is a fwe questions i'm asking myself.\r\n1- Is your champion rework/update list long?\r\n2- How come Tristana got \"buffed\" when urgot can barely teamfight?\r\nI know i'm bad at this game, but let's look at the facts, even a bad player like me can see urgot is not that good. All i can do with him is cutom 1v1 a Lee Sin. \r\nYeah i know my post sound like whining, but please answer me. I want to improve if i'm the problem.\r\n\r\nNoticed this after receiving the Giant Enemy Crabgot freely from Riot (wich is highly appreciated by the way) ","replies":[{"poster":"Xethan","date":"2015-01-13T22:25:10.089+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The reason is that Tristana just needed a rework for one spell and some numbers tuning whereas Urgot needs a whole new lore / theme (same as Sion), all spells reworked (apart from maybe one or two) and on top of that a visual rework (for Trist it's more of an update).\n\nEven if it is totally random numbers, Urgot is easily 10 times harder to rework than Trist.","replies":[{"poster":"DaybreakGenetics","date":"2015-01-13T22:47:17.731+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you very much, true. :)","replies":[]}]}]}
