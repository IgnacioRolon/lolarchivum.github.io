You CAN roll back punishment levels with good behavior. :)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"MadMad Sickness","date":"2018-03-22T15:27:09.019+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Understand that this ban system is alot like filling a bucket.  Once you fill the bucket, you receive your punishment.  Additionally, once you fill a bucket you work you way towards filling the next bucket, and the next bucket, and so on.  Working your way up the punishment tiers is the same as fulling multiple buckets.  Some behaviors fill the bucket quickly while others do it slowly.  Some behaviors can even fill a bucket instantly.  And if you are especially careless, some behaviors can fill several buckets.  The punishment tiers are as follows:\n\n* First Offense: 10 Game Chat Restriction\n* Second Offense: 25 Game Chat Restriction\n* Third Offense: Two Week Suspension\n* Fourth Offense: Permanent Suspension\n\nSO, if you've received a 14-day ban then you've filled 3 buckets already and you are working your way towards filling the 4th and final bucket.\n\n[PSA: I JUST GOT A 14-DAY BAN!?!?

The trick is to figure out what Riot considers to be toxic, and don't do that toxic stuff.

The system only notifies one of the people who reports an individual. Also , it's much more difficult for the system to detect intentional feeding than toxic chat.","replies":[]}]}
