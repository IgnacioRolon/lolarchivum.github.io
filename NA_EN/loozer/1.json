My power went out due to a storm and I got leaver buster. its fine I have to wait the 20 minutes because my leave had externalities on other players so that is acceptable; however, the Bug I am discussing not only puts my through the 20 minute Queue, but after the 20 minutes has elapsed I am never put into the match making queue. League of legends says I am in queue but I have been in queue for almost an hour. Does this mean I am never allowed to play league again?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Tantram","date":"2017-11-06T22:50:27.247+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can you post of a video of this so I can see if we can recreate it, or understand what is going on?","replies":[{"poster":"TofuRoll","date":"2018-08-11T03:42:43.309+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"how can you post a video when it is already crashed.
