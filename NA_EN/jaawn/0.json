Heroes of the Storm decided NOT to do this for all of the reasons I do NOT want Riot to do it.  Here is some explanation by Blizzard:\n\n> When we look at the data for parties of three and four players in Hero League, we often see large skill gaps among party members. This is fine for players in a party of four, for example, who have agreed to queue together despite any differences in skill that may exist. However, the matchmaker needs to complete the team by pulling in a fifth player who queued up alone, and did not necessarily want to play with teammates of varying skill levels.\n> \n> This can also create situations in which party members will discuss strategy with each other, but don't end up communicating the game plan to their fifth teammate. On the other end of the spectrum, solo players may disagree with the party's decisions, or show unwillingness to help the team. This can result in a friction for both sides if communication doesn't improve.\n>  \n> What's more, parties of three and four players appear in Hero League queues far less often than solo players and parties of two. As such we feel that large parties represent a small enough portion of Ranked games that we're comfortable removing them from Hero League in order to improve overall match quality.\n\n(from http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/19883523/party-size-changes-for-hero-league-9-2-2015 )\n\nI think Blizzard has it right 100% here.  LoL matchmaking is already very noisy in solo queue (i.e. large skill differences in players matched together), why make it even worse?  Just so a small subset of players can play ranked with extra teammates?  For what purpose?  Normal Draft is a great queue for odd team sizes.  Just leave it there.","replies":[]}
