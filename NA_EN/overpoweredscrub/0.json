Here's the thing. I never jungle. Why? Cuz i feel like it's such a useless role that is easily a noob trap unless you actually know what you are doing as jungle. Most low elo junglers just waste time farming the entire game and never help. It is definitely not useless if the jungler knows what they are doing, but most lower skilled junglers in normals have no idea what they are doing and that's why generally in normals jungling is useless and a noobtrap role.\r\n\r\n-Examples\r\nThey think that them stealing the enemy jungler's raptors has such a huge impact on the game and is gonna make the enemy jungler soooo behind. But in actuality, the enemy jungler just has one less camp to clear and instead spends his time ganking lanes putting pressure by either dealing damage to a random laner or blowing their summoner's if not both. Or better yet, killing the other laner and getting fed.\r\n\r\nI get it, a jungler who is farming is good yes, but only if they actually know how to react. If the enemy jungler is beating the crap out of a lane, getting kills or blowing summoner's and taking tower or dealing lots of damage to towers and your jungler thinks they are ahead cuz they got like 10 cs ahead of the enemy jungler, they are sadly mistaken. 10 cs is not greater than towers, kills, summoner spells. Maybe if you were like yi or udyr who has a very strong late game then probably, but considering there is more gold from towers and kills than a measily 10 cs, it's not like you are that much more ahead because you are a camp or two ahead of the enemy jungler if all you do with your gold is just continue farming while your team and towers are getting beaten up.\r\n\r\nNo matter how strong a jungler gets, if they stay in the jungle all game, they will never win.\r\n\r\n-Purpose\r\nNow why did i write this post? Because I just played a draft game where i was autofilled jungle. I picked zed, and literally did not farm the jungle at all. All I did was go mid and proc my electrocute on the enemy, run away to top, do the same, run away back to mid, run to bot, i was basically roaming all game. I had mobility boots and just ran around to lanes and proc my electrocute to make the enemy laners have a hard time being forced to back early missing lots of cs, blowing summoner's, blowing ults on me etc. I blew summoner's, dealt a ton of damage, got kills, got towers, and i never was behind the enemy jungler in level despite never farming the jungle because i got so much exp soaking from lanes but it was not a huge detriment to my laners considering i blew the enemies summoner's and they were always behind because they were forced to back so often. \r\n\r\nWe stomped the game so hard and it's exactly the same playstyle I see when I lose because the enemy jungler is actually doing something while my jungler is afk farming. Well this game, it was the same thing. The enemy lee sin was never really seen often, always farming jungle and when he does actually do something, he is dead when he ganks despite having over 50 cs or more ahead of me. I literally only had 20 cs that entire game but we won and i was still doing relatively high damage despite not having farm. I think that jungling should not be forced upon players at least in low skilled games because most people don't know how to jungle so just doing stupid stuff like aggressive ganks is much more effective and easier to execute than jungling where most people are trapped in the farming simulator game. I'm tired of people being forced to jungle when it's not that effective in low skill games because a jungler is only effective if they actually know what they are doing.\r\n\r\ngreat jungler > aggressive roamer > lower skill jungler who doesn't know what they are doing but get forced into the role or learning jungling.\r\n\r\n-Reminder\r\nRemember, this is draft normals in a very low skill level with players around unranked-silver. I get that maybe in higher skilled games, it might not be as effective, but in normals, people need to stop being so toxic and blaming all the time or trying to complicate the game thinking that they must jungle and never gank because they are a good player and good players just power farm. Not true at all. Yes, I know it's not the jungler's job to win your lane, but if the enemy jungler is ganking you bot all game and your jungler isn't doing anything about it, then it kinda is their fault considering they could do something about it but choose not to.\r\n\r\nI literally won because unlike the lee who spent most of his time in the jungle, i was actually pressuring lanes and doing something on the map instead of wasting time farming and never doing anything between farming.\r\n\r\n-TLDR\r\nPeople need to stop being toxic to those not wanting to jungle and forcing other's to jungle or overcomplicating jungling in lower skilled games because it's a noob trap. I literally won a draft normal game as zed jungle where i never farmed a jungle camp and literally roamed all game doing big damage, blowing summoner's, and taking down towers. In lower skilled games especially normals, most junglers are a liability because they either are learning how to jungle, or don't know what they are doing but just had to pick up the jungle role because community forces it as a necessity. While i think a roamer or extra laner is more effective and easier to play than a jungler who doesn't know what they are doing.","replies":[{"poster":"GatekeeperTDS","date":"2019-09-25T15:00:50.371+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":">  think that jungling should not be forced upon players\n\nYeah, no.

I'm talking about the role jungle and how it's forced by the community almost always. But the role is very bad if the jungler has no idea what they are doing as a double laner is a lot more effective with less skill required.\n\nIt would be the same as saying, garen is very powerful compared to playing a higher skill champ like ahri for lower skilled players, but an ahri can be more effective than a garen at higher levels. A lower skill player will perform extremely better playing garen than playing ahri. But in this case, community forces you to jungle and if you don't they all flame you despite jungling being worse than just roaming or having an extra person in lane if the player is at a lower skill level.\n\nA jungler who spends all their time in the jungle, never looks at map, never keeps track of the enemy jungler, or doing anything a jungler supposed to be doing at the right time and all they are doing is farming the jungle, that is not a good jungler and that player is better off being double top, double mid, triple bot. Extra laner or roamer is easier to play and has bigger impact when it comes to lower skill games.","replies":[{"poster":"GatekeeperTDS","date":"2019-09-25T15:32:19.287+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":">  But the role is very bad if the jungler has no idea what they are doing as a double laner is a lot more effective with less skill required.\n\nI will say this, and it will be unpopular.

Ranked is not a place to learn really more so than to try your best to win. \n\nI am simply talking about normals like blind/draft where the community will always force a jungler onto someone despite it being a huge set back generally for unskilled or low skilled players. I think if someone wants to jungle then that's fine, but don't force others to because the whole \"we need a jungler or we automatically lose\" line. Yes a good jungler is very effective, but one who doesn't know what they are doing are better off in a lane because that way they will at the very least provide \"presence\". Simply being there can put pressure on a lane. \n\nI think the only things that should be forced is that everyone should be at a lane trying to defend and take down towers/inhibs/nexus as trying to win.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"1 Inch and Proud","date":"2019-09-25T19:01:08.466+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=GatekeeperTDS,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=lbPAeEze,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2019-09-25T15:00:50.371+0000)\n>\n> Yeah, no.

By not having a jungler you give up an income stream, and if the opposing team realizes you're doing this, you end up with an enemy jungler with a gold and level lead on your solo lanes.\n\nThat aside, why would you want to practice something that limits your growth as a player?

Laners killing minions is actually helpful because you actually are pushing lanes. You can kill jungle monsters all game but you will never win the game if all you do is attack jungle monsters.\n\nEven if I give up a player farming the jungle, that player is still useful by what I said earlier. You apply pressure to lanes by dealing damage to enemy laners, blowing summoners, taking towers. Meanwhile a person who jungles who doesnt know what they are doing, will spend time farming a jungle and not actually ganking or taking down objectives when it's most important. I'm not saying someone has to be perfect, but most unskilled players waste too much time in the jungle rather than applying pressure to a lane and i feel it's easier to just double lane.\n\nYou say why would i want to practice something that limits my growth as a player? Well first of all, im not trying to climb like you all hence why i don't play ranked. Second, I never said people should limit their growth as a player, I said jungling should not be forced in normals, especially lower skilled games because bad jungling is worse than extra lane. If I only play normals and im at a lower skill level of players where jungling is more often a liability, id prefer if it wasnt something forced by the community.\n\nIt's basically like how people think you \"HAVE\" to have a marksman adc and whatever is considered a support bot. Yes in higher skill games it's very effective, but in normals and lower skill games it's not necessary. I'm not saying it isn't good but people make it seem like it's the law, it's the rules, it's the only way. But that's not true at all. I've seen many normal games where teemo adc wins bot a lot because no one knows how to deal with teemo in lower elos and teemo is very easy mechanically to play vs an adc who doesnt know how to adc or position. You can easily win in lower skill normal games playing something as dumb as zed wukong bot lane or anything not currently played as adc and support bot. If you want to talk about ranked that's completely different so stop coming at me like im saying this applies to ranked. I will repeat myself because you don't comprehend what I'm saying but I think it shouldn't be required to jungle in lower normal games or be required to play traditional adc or traditional support in a normal game when you have a higher chance of winning doing stuff like no jungle or kill lane bot because mechanically it's easier and wins you games. No i dont care about climbing and dont do this in ranked or play ranked. I am specifically talking about normal games in lower skill games.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"VindicatorOFThey","date":"2019-09-25T15:02:56.057+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":">Why people need to stop being toxic\n\nIf people are aways toxic  they will get punished (dont be toxic > dont get punished)\n\n>and forcing other's to jungle in low skill normal games\n\nPeople cant force  anyone  to play your assined lane . if they steal it then  its reportable .","replies":[{"poster":"overpoweredscrub","date":"2019-09-25T15:07:36.755+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ebonmaw,realm=EUNE,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=lbPAeEze,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2019-09-25T15:02:56.057+0000)\n>\n> If people are aways toxic  they will get punished (dont be toxic > dont get punished)\n> \n> People cant force  anyone  to play your assined lane . if they steal it then  its reportable .\n\nreportable doesnt always mean they get punished.

That game I had smite but just roamed and got kills, summoner spells, towers and we stomped and won. No one complained.\n\nOther games though, in blind and draft not ranked, it is safe to assume everyone thinks jungle is necessary. If no one has smite on the team during champ select, there will always be one person who thinks they are being the bigger person by taking over jungling which in a way is being a bigger person.... But when a person is terrible at jungling but only does it because they think we \"need\" a jungler or we cannot win, that's where I get mad. I get mad because people overcomplicate this game thinking you cannot win without a jungler but this is not true when it comes to blind pick and draft normals in lower skill games where most players don't know how to jungle.\n\nI'm tired of playing with players who jungle not because they want to learn how to jungle or improve it, but because they do it because they feel either forced to by other players, or they feel like they cannot win without a jungler on their team. Yet when they jungle, they spend all their time only farming and never doing anything during crucial times like if 5 enemies are pushing down mid, the jungler is oblivious to it and just keeps farming jungle instead of coming to defend or assist.\n\nYes, farming jungle does do something but there is a huge impact difference between taking raptors vs taking inhib. Clearly the inhib is more important but low skill players will prioritize clearing any camp over taking objectives. This is what makes jungling a liability because people don't know how to prioritize objectives.\n\nWho cares if you deny jungle gold and exp from the enemy if all you do is spend time in the jungle while the enemy is taking your towers, your allies lives, your allies summoners, your allies item cooldowns, your inhibs, your nexus?\n\nYou might not believe me, but there are plenty of lower skill players who don't look at the map, don't listen to pings, and literally afk jungle while the enemy is beating down your nexus towers. And what frustrates me is that people think it's because it's necessary to have a jungle so they afk jungle and forget that there are more important things are specific times and situations than just clearing a camp. Clearing and stealing camps is their biggest priorty and that ruins games. That is not the object of a jungler but lower skill players believe so.\n\nTo add to it, people feel forced to jungle. If no jungle someone will call out in chat \"gg no jg\". If someone takes up jg after not even calling it, if the game goes sour they will yell at the person who \"took\" their lane and say \"you forced me to jungle after stealing my lane\". But this is what I hate. People feeling forced and others forcing others to jungle. Because in the games that I play, blind/normal draft and not ranked, most people can do better by not jungling because most people aren't that good at the game including me. It's a lot easier to win without a jungler in most of the games I play similar to how most games are easier to win when you don't pick an adc as adc. example, if i play zed adc, i tend to stomp bot lane hard because i can easily kill their adc just fine as zed along with whoever is bot lane with me. Their adc dies by me, then after that their support just runs away or dies to me and my partner as well. I know this probably wont work at a higher skill game, but i know the games I play many people are not that good at the game including me so it's just easier to play champs like yi, garen, trynd, nasus and stomp others because they don't know how to coordinate and chain cc onto me.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Imperial Pandaa","date":"2019-09-25T20:30:15.299+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe you should play blinds that don't have assigned roles then.
