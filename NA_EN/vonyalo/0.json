I had 2 afk players last game. Why do I have to wait til 20 minute mark every time I have afk in my team? Why can&#039;t you just let players to leave after someone have been afking for 5+ minutes?","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-05-31T00:35:01.939+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because then you are also afking.\n\nNo loopholes, and riot does not feel a need to waste time passing judgement on every single afker when they can just blanket ban them all for being trash.\n\nThat time can be better spent on important things.","replies":[{"poster":"Vonyalo","date":"2018-05-31T00:52:39.145+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ban them... yeah... nice joke dude.
