He wishes she had. But now, seeing what happened to her, and what it does to him... an endless grieve. He must end her sufferings forever... But he would never find a strength inside himself to do this.\nSenna was imprisoned inside Thresh&#039;s lantern for not too long to lose what was left of her humanity. She changed drastically, from who she&#039;s been as a purifier to what she is now: aerial creature in human body, questioning her existance and her past, and at once serving the will of the etherial world, the light of which Thesh&#039;s lantern emits. She has powers, of which she could not even dream before, but she cannot use them by her own will. Because she has one no more.  Accepting Threshes offer for freedom, she hoped for some way to escape, but the sly and mighty chainwarden never would let such a strong and willing soul to be free. Letting Senna to become a human again, Thresh curbed her souls will and took her memory away, making her forget everything that ever happened before the lantern. A birth of another Lantern's slave has occured. The mightiest of all, but still a slave.\nAs strong as Thresh's bounds are, he still couldn't fully Senna's will. She still remained herself, a strong woman who wants only good for the people around her. But when the light blurs her mind, and the ethereal voices give their orders, Senna serves the will of the lantern, keeping the mortal bodies safe until their souls are ready to be taken away by the Chainwarden. Sometimes she wakes up and wonders, what has brought her to that point, trying to resist the light of the lantern taking over her mind again. But it always returns... \n\n**Long Lore:**\n\n[**PORTRAIT**](http://fc06.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2015/003/7/8/senna_portrait_3_merges_by_james_s_flynn-d8cemvw.jpg)\nhttp://fc06.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2015/003/7/8/senna_portrait_3_merges_by_james_s_flynn-d8cemvw.jpg\n[**SIDEVIEW PORTRAIT SKETCH**]( https://scontent-iad3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpf1/v/t1.0-9/10897743_915639641793546_1568455470220786525_n.jpg?oh=6cd15b08b6fe7134674f23ba45aee317&oe=560B3D8D)\nhttps://scontent-iad3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpf1/v/t1.0-9/10897743_915639641793546_1568455470220786525_n.jpg?oh=6cd15b08b6fe7134674f23ba45aee317&oe=560B3D8D\n\n*\"I do not remember anything about my previous life - what happened before the lantern.  My memory has been wiped away by eternity...\"* - **Senna, the Lantern&#039;s Light**.\n\nThe only thing Senna remembered on the whole is that she was a good woman. Fighting for good, at least, as she was told. But now she wouldn&#039;t even be able to distinguish the good and evil. This doesn&#039;t frighten or amuse her, she just takes it for granted. Without any memory of a life outside the lantern, she feels nearly nothing just because she doesn&#039;t even remember what and how to feel. Thresh is the one who let her out of the lantern, but why? What he sought by doing it, when she had such a great price to pay - her memory? Where is she? Why&#039;s everyone she meets looking at her with... sorrow? Who is that weird man willing to kill her, crying and saying the same words every time: \"You&#039;re not Senna, you can&#039;t be... Senna wouldn&#039;t let to do this to herself. You&#039;re offending her memory! She won&#039;t be at peace until you&#039;re dead!!\"\n\nWhen Thresh has trapped Senna inside the spectral prison, it seemed like there was no way back. She was in despair. Senna still kept to her senses and realised what happened, but this understanding only made it harder for her to get over it. She couldn&#039;t accept the fact, that now Lucian, her beloved, stands alone against this world without her support, her strength and resolve. How would he, kind, warm young man, get over that kind of loss? The last thing Senna could do is to give him a look, look right in his terrified, despaired eyes... when Thresh has pulled away the lantern, taking her away. Her previous life was gone. She didn&#039;t even have a chance to say &#039;goodbye&#039;.\n\nSenna clearly realised what Lucian would exactly do after he pulls himself together. He would seek revenge, massacring the dead and the living on his way to Thresh. Senna realised this as no-one else would realise, because they spent a lifetime together. But what is this lifetime of love comparing to eternity of suffering waiting her ahead?.. She would have wanted a different fate for Lucian. The loss of his beloved would harden him for sure... Senna tried to escape, but she knew there is no way out of this prison, filled with souls claimed by Thresh from the beings he killed. It was a strange thing to watch - some of the souls were already changed by eternity they spent here - their image was blurred, they did not remember where they or who they were. Others were new, sitting and flying around, grieving for their lives they&#039;ve lost, but none of them were making any attepmts to escape.  \n\nThresh was a bit surprised. Senna was stronger than any other soul claimed by him before, and he felt that. She was the only one willing to escape while it seemed everyone else just succumbed to their destiny. Thresh knew that Senna could do nothing to escape the lantern, and at some point her force of will would break down... But he seeked profit from the willpower Sennas soul disposed. As sly and tricky he was ensnaring Senna, as well tricky and insidious he was when offering a deal for freedom.\n\nThe unexpected offer from Thresh surprised her. His mercifullness seemed weird, as well as his sweet speech about letting her out to her beloved, new magic powers and abilities he will gift her. But the only one thing in this offer seemed true for sure - in exchange for freedom Thesh wanted Senna to leave her memory inside the lantern forever, with no returns. Memory was a high cost for freedom, and Senna knew it. But she still believed, that the next time she meets her beloved, Lucian, they may live a new life together. Senna was so much wrong... \n\nAnd now she doesn&#039;t know who will answer these questions for her. Her soul, deprived of feelings, every of them except sorrow and grieve, deprived of body and humanity, wanders around the world seeking for answers. Acting by the lantern&#039;s order, spreading it&#039;s light to attract more souls to imprison. And sometimes, maybe, if the voice of beloved from her past will break through the lantern&#039;s blinding light, Senna will remember.\n\n*\"I can&#039;t believe she did this. I can&#039;t explain how much I hate myself for hating her for what she&#039;s done!\"* - **Lucian, the Purifier**.\n\n*\"Such a pleasant grieve I feel again...\"* - **Thresh, the Chain Warden**.\n\n\n**Quotes:**\n\n*Champion Select:* *\"Let me seek the answers\"*\n\n*Joke:* *\"I love apples! But I don&#039;t remember why...\"\n\"Cookies! Are they a fiend?..\"\n\"I am so excited!

Sorry. What did you say again?\"\n\"Your soul will be imprisoned and doomed for eternal suffering!.. *shakes her head* Ohh... You seem scared, why?\"\n*In the first part she levitates up from the ground, her eyes and hair lights glow stronger, her voice becomes similar to Thresh&#039;s; in the second, after she shakes her head, she is questioning a subject in front of her*\n\n*Movement:* \"So many questions need answers\"\n\"If only I had other feelings than grieve\"\n\"Will I ever find the answers?\"\n\"This route seems familiar...\"\n\"Why would I accept the deal? *lowering tone* Why would I say that?\"\n\"The lantern longs for souls\"\n\"The light guides me...\"\n\"I don&#039;t know if I hurt anyone, but I don&#039;t mean it for sure\"\n\"So many fates - twisted, So many hearts - broken.\"\n\"Lucian!.. Lucian...\"\n\"I can't... resist...\"\n\"I feel so sorry for him, even that I don't remember who he is.\"\n\"What is that feeling when I see him?\"\n\"I feel like... I forgot something very important.\"\n\"I should stay strong.\"\n\"it's difficult.

Enemies anyhow affected by any Senna's abilities or AAs are lit up for 2 seconds. Lighting up affects all units, including stealthed champions and units.\n\n *[NOTE]: Lighting up effect - reveal, which area is slowly fading over duration of the effect. It means that if this particular revealed champion goes into the Fog of War, their clickable hitbox, as the area of vision placed on them, will decrease over the effect duration.*\n\n**Active abilities:**\n\n - **[Q] - Spectral Infuse** - On the first activation, Senna channels for up to 2 seconds to infuse the terror of the Lanterns souls into the targeted area. While in this area, enemies are dealt 13/19/24/28/32(+10% AP) per tick, and after the channel, if the enemies stay inside the area, they are feared from the center of the area for up to 2 seconds, having their further Tenacity reduced by up to 20%. Tenacity reduction amount and Fears legth depend on how long senna has been channeling. If second activation occurs before 2 seconds, Senna interupts the channel - fear and tenacity reduction are still applied to all the enemies in the area, strength amplified depending on how long the channel occured.\n\n *[NOTE]: The channel is managed as the charging of Nunu's ult - as long as ability is not interrupted or reactivated, it is charging up to it's maximum. F.e., 0,5 seconds of channel, interrupted by Senna or enemy CC, will give 1/4 of the fear's length and tenacity reduction effect, applied to the enemies inside the infusion area*\n *[NOTE]: The Spectral Infuses damage has a tickrate of 0,25 seconds. *\n *[NOTE]: Senna's channel can be interrupted by displacement, fear, stun or silence, as well as by Senna moving or canceling the cast herself. *\n\n *Cost:* 64/73/82/91/100 mana\n *Cooldown:* 13/12/11/10/9 seconds\n *Radius:* 550 units\n *Range:* 800 units\n\n - **[W] - Soul Bond** - \n*Passive* - Senna passively collects the soul energy of every unit which dies in 800 units away from her, gaining a stack each time. Champions which die in that range, give Senna 10 stacks. Max 30 stacks.\n Each stack increases:\n  - [Q] Spectral Infuses damage by 2%;\n  - [W] Soul Bond's spellvamp/vampirism by 0,1%;\n  - [E] Spectral Image's maximal connection range by 5 units;\n  - [R] Lantern's Blessing's duration by 0,1 seconds.\n20+ Stacks Give additional effect:\n  - [Q] Spectral Infuse's cast time is reduced by half;\n  - [W] Soul Bond slows the enemy by 20%;\n  - [E] Spectral Image' s cooldown is refreshed if ally succesfully returns to their image;\n  - [R] Lantern's Blessing slow effect is doubled;\n\n On [Q] Spectral Infuse, [E] Spectral Image or [R] Lantern's Blessing, 10 of passive stacks of Soul Bond are consumed.\n\n *Active* - Senna targets an ally champion to connect his soul with enemy champions soul for 5 seconds. When  connected, ally has 5/7/9/11/13%(+3% per 100 AP) additional spellvamp and vampirism against enemy connected to  him. If they back away from each other more than 900 units, the bond breaks.\n\n *[NOTE]: All passive stacks are lost on death.*\n *[NOTE]: If no enemy units die near Senna withing 10 seconds, passive stacks start to fade out, stack per second*\n *[NOTE]: If no second target is chosen within 8 seconds after targeting an ally, the ability is reset.*\n\n *Cast Time:* immediate.\n *Cost:* 100/100/100/100/100 mana\n *Cooldown:* 22/20/18/16/14 seconds\n *Range: *900 units\n\n - **[E] - Spectral Image** - Senna creates a spectral image of an allied champions soul, floating at the place, where ally was targeted. In the next 6/6,5/7/7,5/8 seconds, ally can right-click their image, if they stay within 650 units from it, and teleport back to its position. If ally gets further than 600 units away from the image, it disappears.\nCast Time: immediate.\n*Cooldown:* 25/25/25/25/25 seconds\n*Cost:* 100/120/140/160/180 mana\n*Range: *400 units\n*Images Clickable Hitbox:* 150 units\n\n - **[R] - Lantern&#039;s Blessing **- Senna becomes a clot of light and dashes to the targeted champion, becoming their shield for 6 seconds, staying untargetable. When the ability ends, Senna appears next to her ally. Senna sacrifices 35% of her current HP to power the shield, making the shield amount to be 150/250/350(+35% of Sennas Current HP). If the shield is not broken, Senna has 60% of it&#039;s current amount returned as HP.\nSenna also slows all the enemies in 400 range from the ally targeted by 15/20/25% (+10% per 100 AP), and grants affected ally additional 15% Tenacity.\n\n *[NOTE]: Senna can&#039;t cancel the ability. She also can&#039;t cast anything (including Summoner Spells and Items) while in Ultimate.*\n *[NOTE]: Soul Bonds and Spectral Images casted before Ultimate do not disappear.*\n *[NOTE]: If an ally dies before the cast time ends, Senna just dashes to their last location, giving Lantern&#039;s Blessing 3 seconds cooldown.*\n\n *Dash Speed:* 1000 units/sec\n *Cast Time:* 0,25 seconds. \n *Cost:* 150/150/150 mana + 35% og Senna's current Health.\n *Cooldown: *130/110/90 seconds\n *Range:* 800 units.\n\n \"Your souls time has not come yet.\"\n \"I will protect your flesh prison before your soul is ready.\"\n \"Lantern Blesses you now.\"\n\n**Tips:**\n\n*Playing as Senna:*\n- As an alternative to full fear, you can briefly channel your Spectral Infuse to give you and your allies some extra time.\n- Don't waste Soul Bond stacks, use their effect to precisely ambush the enemies.\n- Passive's effect on wards applies to true vision of vision wards as well.\n\n*Playing against Senna:*\n- When Senna Ults, try to break the shield if possible.\n- When trapped into Soul Bond, try to use all your escapes to get out of range, even if your enemy is very low on HP.\n- Displacing Senna when she is trying to cast Spectral Infuse or Lantern&#039;s Blessing will cancel the casts, but her Ultimate will be able to cast again in 3 seconds.","replies":[{"poster":"Zooreka","date":"2015-05-28T04:30:36.379+0000","up_votes":37,"down_votes":3,"body":"I really hope Riot picks up on this.

These feelings are generally considered irrational in light of the danger or risk endured by the victims, who essentially mistake a lack of abuse from their captors for an act of kindness.The FBI's Hostage Barricade Database System shows that roughly 8 percent of victims show evidence of Stockholm syndrome.\nStockholm syndrome can be seen as a form of traumatic bonding, which does not necessarily require a hostage scenario, but which describes \"strong emotional ties that develop between two persons where one person intermittently harasses, beats, threatens, abuses, or intimidates the other.\"[4] One commonly used hypothesis to explain the effect of Stockholm syndrome is based on Freudian theory. It suggests that the bonding is the individual's response to trauma in becoming a victim. Identifying with the aggressor is one way that the ego defends itself. When a victim believes the same values as the aggressor, they cease to be perceived as a threat_.\n\nMy  point is,you could make much more of her character.A maiden that escaped,a rebbel or a person that has been turned to the darkside becomming what she and Lucian hated the most,has more depth than ˝I serve the lantern!˝\n\nIm getting far into this.Sry for being annoying xd","replies":[{"poster":"Ph2t25fNyX","date":"2015-05-29T14:07:08.491+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're not being annoying at all! :D I love that you want to help me with this concept, and i appreciate it!\n\nAbout a cleansing ability - YOU'VE JUST GAVE ME A NICE IDEA!

Cleansing may be a unique mechanic over here, as well as directed vampirism and spellvamp!\n\nAbout the stockholm syndrome - I don't actually think that it fits the League. I mean, look at most lores - general, magical, nothing even closely explained. I here have already opened most things people would like to know about Senna, leaving nearly no mystery to surround her. I tried to keep it close to \"classy\" league lores, so that's why i avoid any more detail or re-detail.\n\nDon't take it as I don't liek the change!
