Since I started playing, patch note 6.1, I&#039;ve noticed that what&#039;s considered a good support changes a lot. When I first started everybody complained about me not choosing a tank support when I chose Janna or Nami instead, then more around mid season people complained about me not choosing troll support picks like Brand and Vel&#039;Koz. Most recently people have been starting to be ok with me choosing squishy supports like Janna, but still people tell me I should go more AP heavy supports like Zyra or basically anybody else except Janna. So, I&#039;m wondering, what kind of support do you want on your team? \r\n\r\nPlease answer seriously, I&#039;m honestly trying to do a survey and find out what&#039;s the most popular support type. Also, please write in the comments why you chose the type of support you voted for.","replies":[{"poster":"Zach Sandwhich","date":"2016-12-23T21:10:51.949+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a support main, Jannas make me want to commit suicide. Literally one of the most fucking annoying champions in the game. So if you like to play Janna, play Janna, because Janna is honestly one of the best supports in the game right now and is always a solid pick ~~even though she's the reason my local store is out of bleach.~~\n\nAlso Brand and Vel aren't troll picks, simply Mages whos base damage is good enough and they have some sort of CC, sorta like Zyra or Morgana, just less CC and more damage.
