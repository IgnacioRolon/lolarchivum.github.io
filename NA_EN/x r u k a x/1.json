My hardest choice right now is which summoner spell to take, either exhaust or ignite. With exhaust you get an easy way to shut down fed and hard to kill opponents but an issue for me is that I never really know when to use it in lane, it&#039;s either like I never use it at all because I never see the correct time to use it in lane or I just use it to early in fights and make laning phase harder for me. With ignite however you know when to use it and the only supports who can counter it are Janna and Karma, because they shield, both of which barely anybody plays in Bronze, so having ignite almost always guarantees winning lane. \n\nPlease vote and comment why you chose which summoner spell.","replies":[{"poster":"ItsOrval","date":"2017-05-18T18:44:20.347+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If nobody on your team has exhaust, get exhaust. You need it for when someone gets too snowbally so you can shut them down using it.\n\nIf someone has exhaust, determine whether they have too many snowbally champions and get exhaust.\n\nIf they dont have a lot of snowball champions, take ignite.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hub5","date":"2017-05-18T18:40:40.283+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ignite is the wasn't nerfed, exhaust was.

In this situation, it's often a personal preference.\n\nIt's worth pointing out that Ignite on supports is more weighted towards laning phase strength, whereas Exhaust is much more useful in mid- to late-game teamfights.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Elite4Runner","date":"2017-02-23T10:52:22.432+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Exhaust is the more commonly agreed upon support summoner. \n\nIt is generally best to use when you are going all in, or your opponents are going all in. \n\nIt will make it difficult for your opponent to escape if you are trying to secure a kill. \n\nAlso, keep in mind that it slows their attack speed as well. This means it decreases the enemy ADCs DPS, making it more difficult for them to get a kill, potentially allowing you to turn the fight around, or escape.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-02-23T08:58:58.173+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are more supports that can shield than that XD\n\nBut exhaust is much better for a support in most cases.

If you are super agro and want an early lead, take ignite.
