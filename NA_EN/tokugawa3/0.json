It's just a tale, and involves an evil ice witch locking up a poor troll, and some have theorized this is Lissandra and Trundle, who I think have worked together in the lore before. I don't think there's any proof as to what they wanted, maybe it was to get the door off?

Though they have since retconned Watchers to be related to the Void in some way we're yet to understand (at least beyond Vel'Koz, who I don't know is a Watcher, a creation of the Watchers to control the Void implying they're separate entities or that is what he is and The Watchers/Void are the same). \n\nWhich suggests that his lifespan is limited, and isn't necessarily immortal or timeless. That might change when they redo his lore. \n\nWhether he's an unwitting Iceborn that is reincarnating throughout time (and thus wouldn't be Braum, same as Ashe isn't Avarosa) I wouldn't know. I'd prefer not, otherwise you might as well lump in Sylas, Olaf, Tryndamere etc and put any Freljordian with exceptional abilities in that category. And as far as I know, Braum wields a True Ice shield, but doesn't manipulate True Ice. Rather the shield itself creates the projectiles and the ice when he slams it. Same as Trundle can create pillars of ice thanks to his weapon, while Sejuanni creates blizzards and Liss spawns it in independently.
