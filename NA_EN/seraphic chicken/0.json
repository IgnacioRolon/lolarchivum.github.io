I saw the post about the rainbow poro icon and I wanted to thank you and say how much I(and i'm sure many others) appreciate the gesture. As a lesbian it means a lot to see a game developer that's been part of my life for 8 years now doing things like this!\r\n\r\n...In the end, though, the rainbow poro icon is just a small gesture. It's not an empty gesture by any means, and I'm not here to accuse you of homophobia or anything like that. It's pretty clear that Riot tries hard to be an inclusive company. You just donated a whole bunch of money to lgbt charities. I'm dating a Rioter so I know how great you guys are about having a safe and inclusive workplace. Your values come through loud and clear. \r\n\r\nMy question to you is: **how is this philosophy reflected in the work that you produce?** So far we have Varus, who is two half-dead boyfriends trapped in a body controlled by a demon, and some extremely, extremely minor characters in stories that don’t have any impact on the game itself. Better than nothing, I guess? But is “better than nothing” the best we can do? \r\n\r\nThere’s a few other scraps here and there, like Star Guardian Jinx’s obvious jealousy about Lux giving Ezreal any attention in the SG story. There’s also some stuff about Leona and Diana, [like the tweet when gay marriage was finally legalized in the United States](https://twitter.com/leagueoflegends/status/614549024700538881?lang=en), and [the pool party post with Leona swooning over a woman](https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/champions-skins/skin-release/and-pool-party-pentathlon-winners-are). Are they just going to be bread crumbs, none of which are presumably “canon”, with no satisfying payoff? There’s an opportunity here, especially with the way Leona and Diana’s story was never resolved after the Mt. Targon update, and left hanging with Leona urgently needing to tell Diana some big discovery. \r\n\r\nI want to know what your plans for the future are when it comes to gay characters. I’m not asking you to tell me the details of what you’re working on, if anything. I simply want to know that you have plans beyond the occasional joke or plausibly-deniable fragment. I want to be able to see the values that you clearly believe in reflected in the game you make. I want to believe that you are capable of writing gay characters without killing them or making them jokes or background characters, characters whose stories pay off in some way. I don’t feel like this is out of reach for you, and if it is, I would like to understand why. What place do gay characters have in the story of League? Do you feel like you need a \"special reason\" to make a character gay? Writing romance in general doesn't seem to be a problem, with Valmar and Kai, or Xayah and Rakan, or that Darius comic where he's drawn fully nude and having sex with a woman. I would love to know more about the process that goes into creating a character’s story, and how that would look when writing a gay character. \r\n\r\nThank you for taking the time to read this! This is something that’s been on my mind for a long time now, and I saw this as a good opportunity to ask about it and maybe get a response. \r\n\r\nIf you're in this thread to complain about how you're totally not a homophobe but you don't want to see gay characters or whatever please find something better to do with your time. Obviously Varus didn't stop you from playing League. There's plenty of space for a discussion like this as well.","replies":[{"poster":"Arakadia","date":"2018-05-20T20:15:36.701+0000","up_votes":29,"down_votes":22,"body":"Some people argue that there needs to be a reason for a character to be gay.

Random romances with totally unrelated characters who really shouldn't have much interest in one another EVEN IF they somehow had met.

It does serve a purpose, it expresses their dynamic and backstory. Sure it doesn't need to be a crush, but that is actually the easist way to represent their relationship: \"We used to be friends, until you talked to the gun\" doesn't carry near as much weight as his budding love being torn apart by Jinxs developing \"Rules/Buildings/People are meant to be broken\" personality. Note that this would still work if Ekko was a girl or Jinx a boy, so it's not about their gender, but their relationship.\n\nSo yes the fact that Ekko was attracted to Jinx at some point (he could still be bi) does have a reason to be included.\n\nI feel like Zoes crush does add to her childish personality, so while it doesn't add new narrative it helps in characterisation. Same thing for Illaoi who is attracted to people who follow her religion. Didn't Rumbles crush used to add to his story in the older lore?

It comes across a bit like just trying to jump on a bandwagon without the commitment to action. In the game that's going on with 130+ characters, not having any LGBT interactions at all is starting to look deliberate, especially when other diversity is organically built into the champs we play. It'd be nice to have you guys have an open conversation at your HQ about how to fix this, because statistically, some characters should have had some non-straight interactions by now.

You're holding the bar for POC and minority characters higher than straight, \"white\" characters because in games for a long time, \"straight, white, male\" was the default and the assumption. But why do we default to that? We don't bat an eye when a character are those things, but the instant it's something else (a woman, a queer character, etc.) there's infinite scrutiny and complaints that they \"don't make sense.\"\n\n2) The idea that Runeterra (or any fantastical world) defaults to homophobia, or traditional gender roles and dude-led kingdoms and governments, seems awfully limited from an imagination standpoint. We as writers have the privilege and responsibility to build this world from scratch; why can't it be better than our own? Demacia may repress magic, but why must that also mean it is against certain expressions of love? Noxus is a place where merit and strength is more important than anything. Many people have said \"I don't care about a character's sexuality, just their skills and abilities.\" I see no place that's more true than Noxus.","replies":[{"poster":"Lawd Dawg","date":"2018-05-24T21:48:59.320+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well damn, wasn't imagining I of all people would get a response.

Lux afraid that Garen would turn her in, Fiora having to kill her own father out of honor, J4 holding himself to a higher standard. If they aren't repressive to certain expressions of love, why haven't we seen it yet.

As a deeply repressive state, Demacia may qualify, particularly since Fiora comes across as a closeted lesbian, but then Noxus is canonically a place where sexuality is entirely fluid, and frequently used as a tool for self-advancement. In a universe where only one out of a dozen locations has the potential to be homophobic, and where there is strictly no mention of homophobia at all, there isn't really an in-universe obstacle to writing queer characters, particularly since we have some already.\n\nMy point with the above question was also that the response didn't really answer the original comment: there is indeed a widespread problem in media where writers frequently prefer to tread familiar ground, and in an environment dominated by straight writers, we tend to see only straight characters get written, or at least characters very clearly written from the perspective of a straight person. More generally, though, the issue is that queer characters still don't get written that much, in part because of prevailing attitudes and a general dearth of existing characters to draw from. In this respect, a queer writer writing straight characters does nothing to detract from that, as that work merely contributes to the status quo. This isn't to say that queer writers should only write queer characters, but writing a straight character isn't exactly unconventional or revolutionary in and of itself, regardless of their writer's sexuality, and so shouldn't be held as such.","replies":[{"poster":"Lawd Dawg","date":"2018-05-23T01:32:50.298+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Alright fair, but they gotta have a reason to be queer. If they just made a champion, and said \"hey, he's queer btw\", that's just poor writing. But let's take Fiora. If they made Fiora a closeted lesbian, and talked about how her fear of her sexuality being discovered made her push harder to take over House Laurent and focus on fencing, then that's a character design we should get behind and push. And maybe they have worked on a character like that, but once again still has to beat all the other character creation ideas.\n\nAlso the problem with you asking for unique queer characters is that there are ways to make a champion unique without being queer. The void champs, yordles, Ivern, Rammus, Vollibear, and others. They aren't your standard heterosexual male or female human game character. Now, you may say, \"well they can just add that volibear is queer, and problem solved\". Yea, now that's just poor writing. Not saying they can't make a gay thunder bear, but just making voli gay makes no sense. Gotta go from the ground up. Take Fiora. If they said \"Hey, her fear of people discovering her sexuality in a repressive state drove her to take control of House Laurent and helped her focus on refining her fencing skills\", that sounds a whole lot better than just making a queer character queer.\n\nAlso, its a lot easier to write a character in your comfort zone. (Well for me it is). So if I'm straight, its easier to write about a straight character than a queer one. LGBT people can write a queer character far better than I could, because they would know the ins and outs of a queer character.

Moreover, nobody is asking to just slap queerness onto characters for the sake of novelty, people here are asking for actual queer characters, i.e. characters who get to bring in completely new narrative opportunities via their own sexuality or gender identity, narratives that currently underserved players can connect with. Valmar and Kai are one such example, and their own romance is just as valid as that of Xayah and Rakan. Moreover, queerness isn't just something one slaps onto characters for the sole purpose of making them unique, it's an aspect of people's identities that would still have value even if it weren't unconventional in any way at all (which is ultimately a goal of queer representation). The mere act of valuing queerness purely in terms of novelty value is itself an issue here.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Lawd Dawg,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=Apu9NoEs,comment-id=001e00000000000000000000,timestamp=2018-05-23T01:32:50.298+0000)\n>\n> The void champs, yordles, Ivern, Rammus, Vollibear, and others.

Who is asking to make all characters queer, or to ascribe sexuality to all characters in League? For sure, League has some non-human characters, children, fantasy monsters, and so on, so there are definitely going to be plenty of characters with no particularly defined sexuality. However, that does not in any way contradict the value in having at least some queer characters in the roster, just as we already have plenty of champions already portrayed as straight.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Lawd Dawg,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=Apu9NoEs,comment-id=001e00000000000000000000,timestamp=2018-05-23T01:32:50.298+0000)\n> \n> Also, its a lot easier to write a character in your comfort zone.

Second, if there are not enough queer writers around to write even one queer champion in League, then _that is itself a major problem_. What you just pointed out is a need for diversity IRL, as by your own reasoning, a writing team that is itself lacking in diversity will simply not be able to write a universe and character roster as rich as if they had people with different experiences on board. People having comfort zones is not a justification for striking out entire groups of valuable characters, archetypes, experiences, and so on, from the narrative, and merely shifts the blame over to poor diversity among writers. Considering how there are at least two queer Rioters who came to this very thread, one of whom is a writer, one can hope that the latter is not the problem here.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Arakadia","date":"2018-05-23T01:10:17.856+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"> Point is, they can't just create a random queer character, they have to find a place for that character, and a background that makes sense.

Taric, for example, could've been the perfect champion to compliment the appearance of other male characters, particularly since he's generally perceived as queer, yet the sauciest thing we got out of him was him calling Diana beautiful, with strictly no equivalent for male characters. This, I feel, was a cop-out, particularly since Taric's whole story codes him as pansexual, yet stops short of any conclusive evidence. Varus's new story did much better in showing an unambiguously gay couple, but none of that has yet translated to anything in-game.\n\nAs a gay man myself, I feel that representation is both exposure _and_ normalization, and both are necessary in achieving equality: a universe in which there are no queer characters, or no characters of color, is a universe that is making the deliberate choice to exclude those groups from the narrative, a choice we have seen far too often in most media. This is especially bad in a universe that aims to represent people and archetypes from the real world, because while an extremely alien fantasy world may have at least plausible deniability, a world that attempts to mirror at least some parts of ours doesn't. It's definitely progress when LGBT people are no longer attacked in public for being queer, or at least not as much as before, but as long as queer characters continue to be kept hidden from most stories, or have their romantic interests only suggested, rather than properly approached, when no such distinction is made for straight characters, then normalization, let alone equality, has not yet happened.\n\nAdding to this, there's been this phenomenon in recent media called \"queer-baiting\", one that is prevalent on at least several Anglo-Saxon films, TV shows, etc.: essentially, two characters of the same gender are shown having an especially strong bond with each other, are frequently put in either comically or dramatically intimate situations, and otherwise generally show what would normally be called attraction towards each other... yet the story stops short of calling them queer, or doing anything with them that would make them unambiguously LGBT. Supernatural is a TV show that is infamous for this, as is the BBC's Sherlock. Frequently, it comes from a desire by the writers to attract a queer audience with the _promise_ of queer representation, while still wanting to have their cake and eat it too by not delivering on any of it, and thereby not offending whichever conservative or mainstream audience they're also aiming for. In the end, it's a cowardly and manipulative move that exploits a media environment that is still largely deprived of substantial queer characters or relationships.

And they don't think that inclusion or representation or diversity should be achieved by marginalizing or oppressing the normal person.\n\nIt is important you understand, that this sentiment has a reasonable basis, to exist. \n\nPlease be mindful: this statement is nuanced. You can easily stretch it to make me seem bigoted. You can easily miss understand it, if you look at the world through any kind of lens.
