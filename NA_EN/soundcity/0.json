At some point, the internet for every other program stops working, then everything(except for the lol client) stops responding, including windows itself. When this happens, the update progress bar on the client stops downloading and hovering over it shows that the download is stopped with no change to the ETA. Left my PC with this running all day one day, league fully installs, however when i tried to open the client, before even the log in menu, it says there's a problem with the client and tells me to restart it(in an indefinite loop). Tried this both on my laptop and desktop with same results","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-08-16T17:28:00.481+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's hard to tell here, but it sounds like either your PC or connection is really struggling to get those updates, so the patcher failed to install properly.
