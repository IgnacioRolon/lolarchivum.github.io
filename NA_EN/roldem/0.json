We DO NOT troll, we DO NOT LEAVE ON PURPOSE, and we should not get punished for this.\r\nPlease, FIX THIS SYSTEM RIOT.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-07T01:11:27.207+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"While you aren't leaving games on purpose, all of that time spent dealing with bugsplats is most likely making the outcomes of those games slightly different. You aren't necessarily being punished for the time spent out of those games, but look at this as a warning that there's something that needs to be fixed with your client to stop the game from crashing. You should be able to iron out those bugsplats by doing a quick repair through the client options, and I'd suggest testing it in a custom or practice game before queueing back up for PVP matches. We definitely need to fix up those crashes first.","replies":[{"poster":"roldem","date":"2017-07-07T08:22:55.110+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for the reply, and I can see your point, but I think that I should not be placed in a lower priorty queue if my game crashed and the game was a remake.\nIf the game was not a remake and they lose because of me, it is somewhat understandable, but if we didn't lose or win, and they had a remake, I realy should not get the leavebuster.\nPlus, I repair the game way too much and still, bugsplats are accuring way too often.\nI think that the game should at least have a system which detectes corruption and bugsplats prior to the champ select, something like a \"Check you game\" button or a \"The client needs fixing\" message.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-07T20:49:26.888+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you keep having those bugsplats over and over, then you might have ended up in that LPQ because of all the games where you crashed.
