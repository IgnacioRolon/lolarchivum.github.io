So i ask is Kayn Mid/Top (Mid most likely Shadow Assassin and Top Rhaast) really that bad of a choice? \r\n\r\nI mean the way I play it is max W first instead of Q and just poke my way to passive and his early kill potential isn't even bad. Plus once you get your passive done, it's literally like having a Kayn on your team just he doesn't have smite. \r\n\r\nI only ask this since I can go like 4/2/2 on Kayn in mid and bot lane lost so hard they're at our inhib like 13 minutes in and all i hear is\r\n\r\n\"Why Kayn mid?\" as the reasoning behind our loss.\r\n\r\nNow don't get me wrong I only do it in normals but is it really THAT bad of a pick? \r\n\r\n~~Also if you REALLY want to flame me I also go Eve mid too but that's a whole different story~~\r\n\r\nI should give a rundown of what I normally do too.\r\n\r\nMy common pick is Assassin Kayn Mid\r\nEither Electrocute or DH\r\nStart Longsword Pots or Corr. Potion \r\nGhostblade and Mobis early on for roaming\r\n(if I'm really far ahead before transforming i sometimes go Duskblade first but its usually Ghostblade)\r\nand then normal Kayn stuff throughout (Duskblade, DDance, etc.)\r\n\r\nI just really enjoy the pick into squishy comps but I just get this looming fear that maybe one day I might get banned or punished for it since I don't really \"play the meta\" all too often.\r\n\r\nThe only reason I really play stuff like that is because I go by the saying, \"If you can make it work, and it's fun to you, there is nothing wrong with it.\" which is how I always approach it. I know it's a competitive game, even in normals and blind, but is it really so bad for me to pick someone that I really enjoy playing even though it's in a position that they aren't normally seen in?\r\n\r\n~~Sorry for the long rant there....~~\r\n {{sticker:sg-soraka}}","replies":[]}
