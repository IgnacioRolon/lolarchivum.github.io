Nearly missed a ban, and as i was telling my team something quick, the typing took forever to load on to the screen and send, which caused me to miss my pick and it kicked me out of champ select :))))))))))))) i dont suspect its anything wrong with my laptop because i can type this just fine, and my laptop is hardwired with nothing else connected to the wifi or being used. idk where to post this. help?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-03-18T02:36:42.805+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your entire client is freezing up in little bursts.
