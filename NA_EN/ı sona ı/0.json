When u have a profile up... click on solo/duo tab. Otherwise what ur looking at is all ranked games including flex.\n\nAnd what this person is doing every single game, is going no flash top, and praying to god no one camps them. Every game the jungler has the bright idea that if they just keep going top, then there's no chance for enemy team, well then his team just gets an auto lose. This is basically a player who hit G4, and then stopped trying because they knew they couldn't go any higher. Sure some of his games look decent, but that's going to happen in such low tiers because there are so many people like that down there that they can cancel each other out. Does that make griefers any less bad simply because both teams probably have one?\n\nDont believe me? How much do you really think this person thought going blitz top with ignite exhaust, and buying icemail and frozen heart was gonna work? He went 3/11/4, wtf is his team suppose to do about that? Conq BTW. \n\nAlso you never even looked at his account, you looked at his picture he photoshopped at start of post.
