What do you board denizens consider trolling? Just the usual stuff, right?   Those players who run it down lane just to die without even hitting the towers going &quot;just having a bad game?&quot; Those players who follow the jungle all game to steal their farm? The player that afks because he didn&#039;t get the gank he asked for because the jungle was on the other side of the map and the player was pushed to the tower and died from over extension gank? \n\nPersonally,  I think the greatest Trolls are the ones who refuse reasonable communication.  ðŸŒŸ You know what I&#039;m talking about.  When you ask the support to hang back by the turret while you back, or at least stand behind minions,  so they don&#039;t get pulled by Thresh or Blitzcrank and die to the ADC,  but it all happens just like that anyways.  Or when you politely suggest to your mid lane that if they are being camped then perhaps they shouldn&#039;t keep hyper pushing the lane and instead focus on last hit farming even if it&#039;s a little boring,  but they tell you to stfu and continue to hyper push and get killed multiple more times saying &quot;well if my dumb jungle would gank.&quot; Or the top laner who keeps trying to 1 v 1 the other top lane but they clearly can&#039;t, and you suggest that if they calm down and focus on catching up in level and farm for a bit they may later be able to take them and they reply with &quot;say one more thing and I&#039;m afking.&quot; Or you are trying to explain to your ADC/Primary farmer bot lane, who has Flash on cool down,  that you are out of wards so you can&#039;t ward the bushes and if you stay pushed you may get ganked, they say they are muting you,  then you get ganked and you both die and the ADC says &quot;useless trash support. &quot; Or you pick an &quot;off meta&quot; (forgive me for using fake terms)  choice and simply because you are a pick they don&#039;t think is a good/proper pick they use it as a reason to invalidate everything you say even if it&#039;s logical,  reasonable,  or game winning. &quot;stfu your a  X trying to give advice what a dumb pick I hope you get banned stupid noob, etc. &quot;\n\nWhile the vast majority of those scenarios are not all highly or even lowly punishable leave,  they have just as much affect on the game as any running-it-down-the-lane insta-lock-afking-after-first-death role-steal-feeding jungle-chasing farm-stealing-just-because player. In both scenarios the players will do exactly what they want without care or consideration of consequence or how they are affecting the other players around them.  The only difference between them, if any,  is one does it out of malicious intent,  while the other does it out of it ignorance and ego. Those who refuse reasonable communication. \n\n\n{{sticker:sona-playing}}","replies":[{"poster":"Colonel J","date":"2018-11-30T03:47:48.075+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Engaging in negative behavior with the sole intention of bothering others.","replies":[{"poster":"Ada Wong","date":"2018-11-30T09:57:46.310+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Colonel J,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=AE9REci2,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-11-30T03:47:48.075+0000)\n>\n> Engaging in negative behavior with the sole intention of bothering others.\n\nI just reported another player who refused to stop trolling.\n\nTwice they ran into my lane with enemy with LOW HP did not commit to the fight.\n\nThey were asked to stop wouldn't stop, came back and started farming, taking XP and CS.\n\nPretty much threw the entire match intentionally upsetting me and causing 3 other plalyers as well as myself to lose match.\n\n**I hope riot lets this player know this type of griefing / trolling, and intentionally upsetting people trying to bait arguments in chat isn't wanted <3.**","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"FullmuteAll play","date":"2018-11-30T03:54:10.308+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Characterisitcs of troll for me:\n1) moves and communication opposite to each other\n2) clear statement of intended trolling and followed up actions\n3) frequent stupid actions/moves regardless intentional or not\n4) descreasing own effectiveness for ineffective actions/moves (e.g flaming, whining, giving advices with low possibility of positive change)","replies":[{"poster":"TrulyBland","date":"2018-11-30T14:01:18.277+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean, at the end of the day we are by definition arguing semantics hereâ€¦ but following your logic a stupid player would be a troll.\nI'd understand (even though I disagree) if you would **consider** somebody a troll if in doubt, therefore including stupid players as a false positive of sorts.

This game isn't purely based around common sense, but also knowing the strengths of your character and the strengths of your opponents character better than your opponent and applying a tactical counter measure to their efforts. And I find that many players cannot take any form of critique, stern of polite, without being discourteous or angry at the attempt. They take it as a personal attack against them rather than an attempt to help them win the game where their current efforts are doing the opposite.\n\n{{sticker:sona-playing}} ","replies":[{"poster":"TrulyBland","date":"2018-11-30T18:19:04.447+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just so we don't run into further misunderstandings: I wasn't replying to you.\nThe point you make, I admit, is a bit more nuanced than the one I was replying to. If I understand what you are saying correctly, you are not implying ignorant players to be trolls, but those who refuse to take advice and therefore effectively intentionally remain ignorant.\n\nThe tricky thing about advice, though: You have no \"authority\", for the lack of a better word. How do I know whether taking your advice is a good idea? How do **you** know that your advice wasn't actually considered? How do you know that the person failing to execute your advice didn't have some sort of thought process that made their action the most reasonable? Mind you, in this case I'm talking only about the first example you've given:\n\n>When you ask the support to hang back by the turret while you back, or at least stand behind minions, so they don't get pulled by Thresh or Blitzcrank and die to the ADC, but it all happens just like that anyways. \n\nYour other examples, where people become defensive or even aggressive about being critiqued are something else entirely.

How do I know whether taking your advice is a good idea?\n\nAt that point an astute player has to evaluate their current conditions vs the conditions suggested. They can A) continue to do what they are doing even though it continues to prove to lead to a bad ending or B) Do something other than they are doing. \n\nOption A) **proves** to lead to a bad ending, option B) gives you a chance at a different ending. \nBut this is precisely where the ego begins to overshadow judgement. The player becomes emotional after dieing 3 times doing it exactly their way, and all they know to do is double and triple-down on what they are doing thats making them die. I NEED HELP I CANT FIGHT THEM ALONE. Now, a few of us will let them know \"it might be wise to stop trying to fight them then and instead focus on farming\" to which they say they are muting you for toxicity and begin to ping for 5 minutes straight and instead of focusing on farming continue to fight them to theirs and the teams detriment. Whether or not the advice is good or bad or the player \"has the right to give advice\" is immaterial in the face of the ulterior option, the player doing the same over and over and expecting a different result. I think they call that insanity. \n\n{{sticker:sona-playing}}","replies":[{"poster":"TrulyBland","date":"2018-11-30T21:07:18.961+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ä± Sona Ä±,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=AE9REci2,comment-id=00010000000000000000,timestamp=2018-11-30T20:06:17.508+0000)\n>\n> Option A) proves to lead to a bad ending\n\nNot quite. **You** have seen **evidence** that suggests it leads to a bad ending. The player in question could have lots of other games suggesting their approach works out.\n\nLet's use a specific example: When I mained Sivir I at some point was really good at baiting Blitz hooks in order to regenerate mana by blocking it with my spell shield. But regardless of your training, occasionally things can go wrong. And as probability dictates that also means that there were entire games, however rare, where this went wrong constantly.\n\nIn this instance you might see evidence that my tactic fails, even though I know that if I get my act together I can make it work.\n\nEdit: This all basically goes in the same direction as outcome bias.

Just because a decision has created a bad outcome does not necessarily make it a bad decision.\n\nI'm not talking about those _**rare character specific**_ strategy scenarios that don't quite go right but are intended for good purpose. In fact I listed some scenarios very specifically, like the mid laner who keeps hyper pushing over and over and dies over and over because they are being camped for it, or the top laner who keeps trying to 1 v 1 but 5 deaths later has not succeeded. \n\nYou may be misinterpreting things and for that I forgive you. But lets be clear, I only suggested things That Lead To A Bad Ending. like a Miss Fortune without flash but farming right under the enemy turret  with no wards no ally jungle to counter gank and no means of escape should a gank happen (with the assumption that the enemy junglers last location is not known) is indeed showing **_strong evidence_** of a bad ending, primarily to seasoned players. This isn't MY OPINION of the end result, this is the most likely end result, getting ganked and dieing for it by being in a scenario that perfectly sets up for it, with the assumption you are at a tier level where such things are expected to happen as predicated by the average skill level. As a game of chess we might not always know the perfectly best move but those who really play at least learn a series of Optimal choices in the current scenario. \n\nBaiting out the grab to regen mana and failing is not the same as trying to 1 v 1 someone you are unable to 1 v 1 at the time over and over despite the outcome being the same after 5 deaths. Your strategy has a least a reasonably positive outcome and a measured chance of success. While shutdown gold from the person you fed 5 deaths to would be a minimum positive outcome, the experience of the scenario is already weighing against the likeliness of it ever happening in a 1 v 1 scenario unless the enemy totally messes up, which after 5 times succeeding in defeating you seems to suggest the enemy has a better grasp on the scenario. \n\nFeeding and trying to prove how good you are =/= a tactic, nor a viable means to win. Being unable to listen to rational communication advice from teammates =/= a viable tactic to winning.\n\n{{sticker:sona-playing}} ","replies":[{"poster":"TrulyBland","date":"2018-11-30T23:43:58.099+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was merely trying to make clear that not everything that ends badly, and not even everything that in your experience ends badly most of the time, has to necessarily be a bad decision.\nBut I guess with those specific examples your point is more than fair.
