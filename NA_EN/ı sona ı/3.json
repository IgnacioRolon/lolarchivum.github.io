That's the nature of range and the bot lane. You're on one side, the enemy is on the other, and there are these things called \"minions\" in the middle. What happens when you \"poke\" someone? Then the minions attack the champion instead of the enemy, causing counter damage and pushing the lane to your side, where they have to worry about over extension and being ganked. \n\nBeing the nature of a 2 v 2 lane they also are threatened by the counter poke of the support as well. Nami? Fiddle? Brand? Soraka? All of them fine counter pokers and zoners. \n\nNow that the \"poked out of lane\" argument has been made invalid, what else is the issue? I've found no fault in farming with Graves so far, but maybe its because I've taken the time to understand the nature of my own auto attacks to be able to last hit with them more aptly than others would choose to. \n\nThe fun part about being pushed near under turret is how easily you can manage the wave there since you can push back minions with auto attacks.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lhuhz","date":"2019-01-13T10:34:16.028+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Graves cant lane on Botlane due to how his aa work if the enemy botlane has a brain.","replies":[{"poster":"HàrrowR","date":"2019-01-13T19:08:15.979+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It happened to me a couple of times that some bad Graves comes to gank me and i kill him without taking almost any damage by kiting around the minions, the same thing would happen in a normal lane, not to mention longer range bullies would demolish him, Graves going up against Cait/Zyra combo","replies":[{"poster":"Lhuhz","date":"2019-01-13T20:34:06.425+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"You dont need to go to a Caitlyn, hell a Vayne could lane bully Graves","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Hammermancer","date":"2019-01-13T18:19:38.847+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ı Sona ı,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=OnafqYld,comment-id=0007,timestamp=2019-01-13T10:12:45.900+0000)\n>\n> Of all the people saying Lucian is a better ADC than Graves, how many of you have actually done a 1 v 1 between Lucian and Graves? \n> \n> Better yet, how many of you have actually played ADC Graves this season? \n> \n\nIt literally only works with taric against double melee \n\n> If you&#x27;re saying Graves isn&#x27;t a good ADC and haven&#x27;t actually played him ADC to make that determination, you aren&#x27;t making a fair argument. \n> \n\nGraves is a bad adc because his passive makes him miss cs regardless of skill, his autos cant target past minions and can be blocked \n\nAnd his low range makes him terrible for teamfights as the 'consistent reliable damage backline \n\n> Lucian can&#x27;t poke you if he&#x27;s blinded.

Being able to actually CS at a reasonable rate is kind of key. And the rest of your argument there would be equally applicable to assassins. Is Zed a better ADC than Sivir, because as soon as you bait/waste her E you just WRQER and spam laugh?\n\nAre you actually trolling? That's not like you.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-01-13T10:00:25.223+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Highlighting the most egregious errors:\n\n> [{quoted}](name=ı Sona ı,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=OnafqYld,comment-id=,timestamp=2019-01-13T09:19:26.354+0000)\n>\n> Lucian gets a double tap passive, Graves auto attacks 2-3 times in 1 auto attack basically.\n\nThe maximum total damage Graves can do in one auto is 140% of his AD (at level 1) scaling to 200% of his AD (at level 18), and that's if all pellets hit the target, meaning basically melee range.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=ı Sona ı,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=OnafqYld,comment-id=,timestamp=2019-01-13T09:19:26.354+0000)\n>\n> Graves' ult is a giant burst damage while Lucian's is lots of little hits over time which is more easily mitigated with armor.\n\nI'm gonna go ahead and link to a wiki page that explains how armor works.\n\nhttp://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Armor\n\nBasically, it reduces damage by a percentage, not a flat value. Armor mitigates exactly as much damage from one hit for X damage as it does from two hits that each do X/2 damage.\n\nAlso, Graves has an autoattack range of 425 while Lucian's is 500, and Lucian's autos deal full damage at any range and can't be blocked, while Graves' autos will deal anywhere from 70%-200% AD depending on how many pellets hit and what level he is.\n\nOnce again, and possibly most importantly for lane Graves: _his autos can be blocked_. See a minion at low health in the middle of the pack that you'd like to autoattack to earn some gold? **_YOU CAN'T_**. This is why Graves is now a jungler.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lhuhz","date":"2019-01-13T09:44:55.546+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"No","replies":[]},{"poster":"Moonscourge","date":"2019-01-14T05:50:31.873+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay who let the Iron 4 trollpost on the boards again","replies":[]},{"poster":"Inkling Commando","date":"2019-01-13T19:53:35.486+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I haven't tried Graves bot but I did Graves mid and from what I have seen from Lane Graves there is two disadvantages from what I seen with him. \n\n1. his autos attack the first thing in front of him, regardless if the intestinal target is behind them.\n\n2. reduced damage against turrets. \n\n2.5. you need to be point blank at the turret cause if you are at a distance attacking it a minion, or even a champion, can get in front of you and your shots attack the minion instead. and if you hit the champion the turret targets you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dynikus","date":"2019-01-13T09:44:16.039+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"His range is awful, he has bad poke in comparison, and his autos are blocked by minions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tormentula","date":"2019-01-13T09:37:38.850+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Graves doesn't outclass lucian due to his passive and his basic attack range. \n\n425 range in bot lane just isn't going to cut it, you could literally get poked out or kited by any other ADC in bot lane, and on top of this, Grave's basic attacks can be blocked by minions.
