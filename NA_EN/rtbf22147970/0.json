This was actually intentional believe it or not. I'm pretty sure that it's for those river fights when you're trying to attack move to an enemy. Since the crab is the only monster that roams, I'm pretty sure that's why it was made this way.  Just speculation tho. :o","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jiberamu","date":"2015-05-25T04:23:48.961+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"you can. a moving is for scrubs you can kite just by clicking  easily","replies":[]}]}
