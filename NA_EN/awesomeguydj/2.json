Much easier to ban all of the super OP's in the current pool, then everyone selects out of the decent ones remaining.

It had the single highest level of engagement of all game modes, clearly it's the one that a majority of the playerbase seems to like the most.  Despite this, Riot talks less and less about it to the point where they discussed RGM in an Ask Riot segment and didn't even mention URF.  \n\nI've heard of being tone deaf before, but Riot is tuning out the playerbase more and more it seems.  Just because you're the most popular game in the world today doesn't mean you will remain that way forever----you can only ignore your playerbase so long before they start to find something else.  It's already happening to be honest.  The biggest decline in players occurred during Season 6 with the dynamic queue fiasco but it's been a slow bleed for awhile.  It's too bad because it is a great game (with the worst community), but it's starting to become obvious that Riot doesn't really give two shits about what we have to say unless it's wrapped in a bundle of compliments.","replies":[{"poster":"The Sword Saint","date":"2017-07-11T15:10:43.477+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Most of the playerbase is actually sick of URF, it's a vocal minority that wants it around more often.","replies":[{"poster":"Scary Door","date":"2017-07-11T15:39:06.176+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":">Most of the playerbase is actually sick of URF, it's a vocal minority that wants it around more often.\n\nCitation required.  \n\nStatements without sources will not be accepted.","replies":[{"poster":"The Sword Saint","date":"2017-07-11T15:46:42.934+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Right back at ya.","replies":[{"poster":"Scary Door","date":"2017-07-11T16:02:45.525+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"So, the translation is that you don't have any evidence.  \n\nMine is in the amount of social engagement on Reddit, facebook and here on the Boards.

An obvious solution would be to go through and balance every champion and item in the mode to reduce the gaps in power level.
