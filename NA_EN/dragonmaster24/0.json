I was on my computer when this happened thus getting disconnected and then punished for \"leaving/afking\". so now I have 20-25min wait queues for something I cant control. and now I cant even queue up because when I click accept match the client says match accepted and then will say that I refused ready check 3 times in a row causing me to be punished yet again for something I have no control over. this is very flawed and i'd appreciate an understanding and hopefully get rid of this undeserved wait time and not being allowed to queue.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-01T00:11:48.493+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately, we can't pre-empt power outages otherwise we'd probably just take down the servers before they happened. \"Acts of god\" like this aren't within our control so we can't actively prevent them from happening, and the system doesn't have a way to check 'why' you left. It only notices whether you were gone long enough for the other players to be affected. It's not that you're being punished for leaving, you're being punished because the other players you were with now had to try and win without a full team.\n\n\nWhen you're trying to click accept and it doesn't register, that happens due to a faulty connection. When you click, your network isn't up to speed enough to send that click to our servers in time for it to be registered, which makes it seem like you declined. I'd suggest checking out your network settings for anything out of place against the steps in our [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues). If that doesn't help, test out using an ethernet connection to see if that works a little better.","replies":[]}]}
