But today between myself and my freind league has frozen 5 times in 4 games. So i have no idea what to do I've updated all my drivers uninstalled and reinstalled league and nothing yet has worked, so any suggestions on what to do. This is happening in game at seemingly random times.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-18T00:04:59.593+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There was a Windows update that auto-enabled the [Xbox Game Bar](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html) for many players.  This also caused freezes and fps problems for a few players, to the point of having to restart their PC.  Disabling the bar should fix it up!","replies":[]}]}
