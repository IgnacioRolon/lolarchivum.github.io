I&#039;ll state my play styles for each champ to help you decide (please bear with me :) )\r\n\r\n{{champion:236}} \r\nWhat I loved about Lucian is his caster style of ADC. mixing in spells and AA in combat. I also love how he&#039;s so slippery, and his ulti is pretty much a drive by XD\r\nI though didn&#039;t like his base AD damage, and that his performance really drops when he&#039;s OOM\r\n\r\n{{champion:412}} \r\nThis guy is quite popular pick for support, and I get why. Tanky, a hook, good peel with flay, the lantern that saves lives, and the box that makes it so frustrating to catch or run away. Also, unlike most supports, he can actually fight when needed.\r\n\r\nHate about him though is he has little to nothing to help him escape when his ADC is dead (box is most likely used already, and all thats left is a little lantern shield)\r\n\r\n{{champion:201}} \r\n\r\nI decided to play this macho man since he&#039;s free to play this week, and I just love how his kit revolves around &quot;protect the ADC&quot;, since that is usually my mindset as a supp.\r\n\r\nHis Q, W, E all work well at this task. And, if that isn&#039;t enough, he even adds his ultimate into the mix.\r\n\r\nThough, downside is he&#039;s no dualist and dies rather easily when teammates die, as his only form of escape relies on nearby allied minions.\r\n\r\n{{champion:127}} \r\nThis mage champ is so great with her kit. A range poke, a position changer, a stun, and a ulti that either becomes a {{item:3157}} + slow, or a stun + slow.\r\nAlso, have seen her top lane, as her kit is basically anti-melee\r\nDownsides is that her E is slow and at times unreliable. Her stun is hard to use esp. against high mobile champs, and her Ulti forces her at times into a bad position (i dunno. maybe that&#039;s just me)\r\n\r\nSo, if you&#039;ve read through my ranting, Thank you. So, please help a fellow summoner out? Thank you in advance.","replies":[{"poster":"insaiyanbacca","date":"2015-09-22T22:10:38.201+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"imo liss is the best choice shes pretty fun and pretty strong and you can play her mid top and even support/jungle if you wanna figure that out","replies":[{"poster":"Reingel29","date":"2015-09-23T14:09:46.922+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have seen top Liss work wonders on juggernauts due to the fact they build armor.

Rlly fun, her first clear is trash but you're a jungle main so I think you'll find her kit really strong for team fights and ganks. It's not good, but you'll have a LOT of fun playing it \n\nShe's also dope mid/top. Thing is, though shes not that strong against mages that can poke her, she counters a lot of popular champs. Zed at 6 can't kill her, Fizz cannot trade with her effectively, Yasuo also will get rektd, she's extremely hard to burst down but also herself has a lot of burst. \n\nHer ult is fine if you try not to use it on yourself unless you REALLY need it. It's why Zhoynas is so core on her, she can E in, ult someone and zhoynas before she gets blown up.","replies":[{"poster":"Reingel29","date":"2015-09-23T14:11:18.274+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, I agree that Liss's kit works well in team fights. And, the double zhonias (ulti plus zhonias) just makes people go \"f this, im out\" which at times, is hilarious to watch XD\n\nAnd, yes, I have played against Yasao and rekt him really badly XD \n\nThanks for your opinion though.

Ult is point and click. Q is a simple skillshot. No brainer passive. W is click root and she is safe. That is a huge thing at low elo to about gold. If you can be safe and not feed and just cs effectively you will almost always win. Also she doesn't take any communication with your team during ganks which is great for solo Q. Your only job during ganks is to use your point and click cc to lock up the kill. \n\nThresh, while he does take communication from his team, is the best overall. You can play him every single game and never worry about being countered because his kit is so versatile that he can play against anyone effectively","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Tavish","date":"2015-09-23T16:21:34.155+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Zed","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ionian","date":"2015-09-22T21:16:57.300+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:245}}","replies":[{"poster":"Reingel29","date":"2015-09-23T14:13:23.032+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you, but I haven't tried the Ekko and am simply waiting for his FTP moment","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Bhagswag","date":"2015-09-22T22:17:38.067+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd say Braum.
