Recently I bought 2 Hextec bundle at 195RP with the 400RP we get from the level 3 reward. I get the Bouquet ward skin and decide to pay the dust for it to be permanant. I join a game, pick my champion etc etc, remember that I forged the ward and decide to use it but there is only the \"default\" skin and nothing else. Is it still linked to my account or did I just spent 390 RP down the drain?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-13T22:44:07.705+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's a visual issue right now for some ward skins not being selectable.
