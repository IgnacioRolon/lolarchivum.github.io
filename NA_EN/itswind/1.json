I ban it because i don&#039;t want to have a 30% chance of winning.\r\n\r\nAm i the jerk for banning it or is he the jerk for continually picking a champ hes bad with in ranked instead of mastering it in normals first?\r\n\r\nI feel like im in the position all the time, its pretty much the only thing i like about this new system. They usually whine a little during picks, but then do much better with the choice i forced them to pick.","replies":[]}
