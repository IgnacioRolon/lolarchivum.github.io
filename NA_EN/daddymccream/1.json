If you want to try something new with a champion, a good way to do so is to let everyone know what you'll be doing ahead of time and explain your reasonings. If it's just to have fun, maybe try to avoid ranked as that can get pretty serious and those ranked players really take the meta into account. If you're experimenting with a new playstyle or build, make sure to let your team know that as well. Communication is key on the Rift.","replies":[]}]}
