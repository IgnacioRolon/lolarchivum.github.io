If there is an issue with discord and leauge servers then how is it fair that I am being punished when its clearly not a fault on my end??? This is the 2nd time withing 10 minutes in which i literally just posted a form in the miscellaneous tab. Riot please help and fix this shit because we shouldnt be getting losses or leaver busters if its something wrong with YOUR server","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-19T18:00:03.205+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your network is having a problem staying connected to our servers, and Discord may be a coincidence.

I'm not sure why as why it does this since i already play on Ethernet connection since last year. First time this started to happen but i just bought a new computer either way and nothing has happened yet. (hope it stays this way) it was just frustrating since it happened twice in 20 minute time span as i get into my gold promos :c","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"KÃ¼rama","date":"2016-07-18T12:54:37.786+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"[Troubleshoot your connectivity issues.](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues)\n\nhttp://na.leagueoflegends.com/sites/default/files/styles/scale_xlarge/public/upload/su16_keyart_1920x1080_0.jpg?itok=6nj8mHjj","replies":[]}]}
