I came back from california turned on my pc to play leauge and when i start loading into a game my screen goes black  and says no signal however when i tab out it works perfectly fine. However i still hear the in game sounds and everthing just a black screen. But for any other game like starcraft, cs go, diablo my screen works perfectly fine. and this is a 1 week old pc and monitor. Any idea how to fix this? i heard putting it in windows mode would fix it but i cant do that without going into the game itself but like i said when i do i just get a no signal message on my monitor like its not plugged in.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-08T16:33:33.168+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did you work through all the steps in the guide? All the symptoms you're describing are only issues I've heard where there is either an issue accessing a driver or there is physical hardware failure going on.","replies":[{"poster":"DaddyMcCream","date":"2016-08-09T18:45:28.627+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I did and i figured it out however its nothing on there. So pretty much my games changed resolutions for whatever reason which was to big for my monitor to handle since it wasnt the right one. So i simply went into properties file's of Leauge and changed my client to windows mode then when i got in a game changed it back to the correct resoltuion. I would add this to a way to fix a black screen to your list! it worked for me and 3 of my friends who had this same issue in the past week! thank you for the help fams!","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"DaddyMcCream","date":"2016-08-08T15:03:04.611+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also i reinstalled Leauge toady and its still happening but when i installed pbe and played on pbe it worked perfectly fine.
