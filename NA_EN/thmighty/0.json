This was after I was stuck on \"waiting for game results\" window, and restarted the client. The only option i have is to reconnect to the game.  after several attempts its keeps giving me an error message about being unable to connect to the server. Im not sure what to do. As far as i know, im connected, i can see my friends list. And as far as i know the game was over, i saw a victory screen. Do you guys know what is happening here?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-08T23:10:35.163+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This sounds like what we refer to as a *Ghost Game*, and it should last no longer than a few hours at most. It's pretty rare to happen, but when it does it's usually caused by the server not properly reporting that the game was recorded and has ended. \n\nLet me know if this is still happening.","replies":[]}]}
