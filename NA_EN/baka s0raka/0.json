Veigar/Fiddle, Leona/Naut, Leona/Darius, Leona/Panth, etc.\n\nHas anyone else tried out some weird combo? has it worked? who were you against?\n\nSo far I've tried out the ones I mentioned above. Each of them incredibly fun.\n\nVeigar/Fiddle: Lots of CC. Fear, silence, stun, MR shred. Squishy like most bot lanes, relatively safe from ganks since Fiddle can fear the enemy jungler away, or Veigar can throw out his Event Horizon. Also good disengage/engage. Level 6 engages require some good positioning and communication with your lane partner. Channel Fiddle ult from bush (sweep it to make sure it isn't warded), as it's about to land, have Veigar throw out his Event Horizon and hopefully stun their adc or support. So far we've won most of our lanes/games with this combo against typical bot lanes; Cait/Annie, Trist/Blitz, etc.\n\nLeona/Naut: Very tanky, lots of CC. Although, my duo partner went AD Naut. Only done it once so far against a Vayne/Morgana. We got first blood, won lane hard, won game. Can't do too much pre level 3. Naut or Leona can engage. Hook someone, Zenith blade in, stun, another stun for Naut.\nLevel 6 engages are very strong.\n\nLeona/Darius: Same as Leona/Naut. Played it against a Cait/Annie. Can't do anything pre 2/3. Just farm under turret and play safe. Darius can hook everything in front of him, making it easier for Leona to get her combo off. Level 6 engages are great with Darius' resets. \n\nLeona/Panth: Not as much CC as Naut/Leona. Played it against a Twitch/Thresh. Panth passive is very handy to dodge hooks or turret shots. Chain stun for Panth's W and Leona's EQ combo. Panth can get back to lane quickly by ulting, or saving a turret if the enemy is pushing. A little rough in the early game, better in mid-late game during teamfights.\n\nI've also been wanting to try some other bot lane combos like Syndra/Zilean, Fiddle/Ryze, or Soraka/Viktor. \n\nDoes anyone else have any experiences trying out different bot lane combos?\n\nEdit: Oh yeah also forgot I've done ADC Xin with support Nami. Her E synergizes perfectly with Xin's Q. ","replies":[]}
