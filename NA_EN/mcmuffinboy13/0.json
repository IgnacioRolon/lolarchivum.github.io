Riot has made a champion that is beyond even considered broken. What goes through the minds of your champion balance team at Riot. Have you not even noticed what is happening here. He is so ridiculously overpowered in the game, that most of the people playing can&#039;t take it anymore. Take off his Q-heal and NERF HIS PASSIVE. Furthermore, one of the main reasons why he is so OP is the fact that he can use more than 1 ultimate ability. He is so unbelievably powerful, that almost no champion can go up against him. Not only have you made a champion that builds tank and does a ton of damage, but one that is so broken, that he actually ruins the game. Point of this is, NERF DARIUS NOW...","replies":[{"poster":"FatalitÃ½","date":"2016-04-09T19:41:23.410+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He's so easy to kite and beat lmao","replies":[]},{"poster":"BeatzBoyFTW","date":"2016-04-09T17:31:04.985+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"I lost lane to a guy cz I thought I'm invincible, so he deserves nerfs!\" -OP's logic\n\nhttp://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=mcmuffinboy13","replies":[{"poster":"Critmaster Garen","date":"2016-04-09T19:20:19.391+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=BeatzBoyFTW,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=6ITBAIW7,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-04-09T17:31:04.985+0000)\n>\n> \"I lost lane to a guy cz I thought I'm invincible, so he deserves nerfs!\" -OP's logic\n> \n> http://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=mcmuffinboy13\n\nfunny thing is wukong can actually outplay darius by faking out his ult with his w in the right moment.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Critmaster Garen","date":"2016-04-09T19:18:37.769+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=McMuffinBoy13,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=6ITBAIW7,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-04-09T17:28:14.170+0000)\n>Have you not even noticed what is happening here. \n\nthey usually dont pay much attention to what happens in bronze/silver.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dr W","date":"2016-04-09T19:04:33.540+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bronzies gonna bronze","replies":[]},{"poster":"StickyOctopi","date":"2016-04-09T17:54:32.424+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Darius is actually pretty bad right now. lmao","replies":[{"poster":"Mr Broken Wings","date":"2016-04-09T17:56:14.523+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=StickyOctopi,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=6ITBAIW7,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2016-04-09T17:54:32.424+0000)\n>\n> Darius is actually pretty bad right now. lmao\n\nNot bad, he is good, but managable, he is not overbearing but surely on the stronger end.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Mr Broken Wings","date":"2016-04-09T17:29:35.347+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Uhm darius is a pretty easy matchup toplane for me","replies":[{"poster":"jodobo","date":"2016-04-09T17:30:58.712+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its not that he is broken but people dotn know how to kite him and play agunist him in the early game and if he gets a kill he just snowballs. if you know how to play agunist him he is easy to beat","replies":[]}]}]}
