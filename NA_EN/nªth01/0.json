Theyre changing things inside my game, and I am putting in tickets and getting responses. However, I cannot click on the word submit when I go to reply. I NEED to talk to a human. I am extremely desperate because as long as I am talking to the bot, I cant respond. I dont know why I cant click on the word submit, I have done it on my phone and computer, and submitted many tickets. I love this account and just got to gold, and Im horrified of losing it. Please someone help!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-07-20T18:46:32.239+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ticket volume might be a bit higher right now, so it may be a bit.  If you keep replying or spamming new tickets, though, it can cause confusion and delays in investigating your case.  If you have a ticket number I'm down to check it for you, but your best bet is to hang tight while we review what's happening.  Rest easy, though, we can help with recovery!","replies":[{"poster":"nªth01","date":"2017-07-21T01:08:01.389+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok, now my account has been permanently suspended.
