But i followed your steps just in case.\n\nI don't have any special bindings or anything, i use the default bindings along with quick cast, and that's about it. But i did do what you said JUUUUUST in case it wants to happen again.\n\nThanks for replying, and i will definitely reply again if it happens again. \n\nBut so far, so good. Thank you for the help. <3","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DJ Poppers","date":"2017-10-23T20:50:57.908+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had this same problem during my last game on Summoners Rift.. Reconnecting to the game also did not help. I noticed the (bug)? after I was trying to move my champion to a location and it wasn't going to the location and instead my items started declaring themselves. It seemed to think the mouse was clicking 2 things at the same time or something. It persisted throughout the game, the problem seemed to have resolved itself when i checked in a custom game. Should there be a bug report for this?","replies":[]}]}
