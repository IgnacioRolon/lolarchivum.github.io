Yes Shyv counters garen, IF YOU CAN CATCH HIM which you CAN'T. I was so far ahead on shyvana from jungling, literally the only 18 on my team, and i couldn't catch a garen, i had dead mans plate, used my W, chilling smited him, ashe had hit him a couple times with a slow, and he still ran faster than any of us WHILE CC'D.\n\nIt takes an entire team to kill him, and an entire team can't even do that half the time because he either wont die or he can just run away no matter how many stuns and slows you use on him, if you don't kill him he comes back 3 seconds later with full health from his stupid ass heal.\n\nSeriously when is this stupid ass juggernaut patch going to be over with, i'm so sick and tired of seeing nothing but garen, darius, fiora, poppy, the only one killable of them is fiora, the rest are freaking \"raid bosses\" that an entire team can't kill.\n\nRiot wants \"adversity\" and more skill based team work play, YEAH RIGHT MY ASS, i find that hard to believe when you buff champions to RAID BOSS STATUS where an entire team with arm pen and stuns and slows can't even kill the lone standing garen after killing nearly their whole team. Seriously, i'm getting really sick and tired of this juggernaut meta, seeing the same 4 top laners every single match is not adversity or skill based teamplay.\n\nI swear if i see one more garen, darius, fiora, or poppy in the top lane and i will leave my lane or jungle just to tent them the entire match, just for that person playing these champions, that's how sick and tired i am of these same champions being used in every single match and being unstoppable juggernauts no matter how many times you shut them down. \n\nIt takes a real kind of special to break champions so bad they earn the status \"RAID BOSS\" because of how long and how many people it takes to kill these freaking champions.... IF you can that is, 90% of the time they just outlive their teams death and run away unable to be killed or slowed and wait for their teams to spawn and get back.\n\nPlease gut these damn juggernauts already, they are beginning to really urk me.","replies":[{"poster":"Excitidly Insane","date":"2015-11-08T16:17:21.730+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You realize that his kit except for the new villain passive has been toned down right?","replies":[]},{"poster":"VasilisGreen","date":"2015-11-08T13:58:05.636+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I miss the old days, when you Q'd someone end they were silenced for 2.5 seconds, when Q gave you 35% ms boost for 4.5 seconds and when W had tenacity... oh well...","replies":[]},{"poster":"BeatzBoyFTW","date":"2015-11-08T12:45:22.163+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=BagawkZor,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=FnTr2iLH,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-11-08T12:41:37.125+0000)\n>\n> Please gut Garen already.... 1800+ true damage ults, turret dives you can&#039;t get away from, a silencing speed enhancing q that doesn&#039;t end until his E is over, then he just ults you, very few people able to counter him, UNSLOWABLE, seriously, i used chilling smite on him, and couldn&#039;t keep up with him on shyv with my W up, he literally ran away like i hadn&#039;t even smited him at all, and i was right on him literally, smited, W&#039;d and he just ran away like i didn&#039;t do anything at all.

Big burly dudes who get up in your face is how they do, and how they will continue to do into the future of League of Legends. Because while some people like playing the wizard and others like the rogue, others still like to throw on two cars' worth of metal and cleave the former two in half.","replies":[]}]}
