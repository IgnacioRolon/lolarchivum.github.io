The steps in that guide are designed to narrow down the main issue by going through some of the most typical causes. \n\nThis could also be happening from a certain setting you might have enabled. If you're running the beta/updated client and have low-spec mode enabled, it can take a little bit for the client to pull back up. This is because low-spec mode actually closes the client while you're in a match, so it needs to relaunch after games before it can display the stat screen. Either way, essentially your client is having a hard time being able to grab the information it needs to display on the stat screen, which is why it's taking awhile to load. \n\nIf the steps in that connection guide weren't able to help you may just need us to take a closer look at your system to see what's going on.
