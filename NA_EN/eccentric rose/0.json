It's an understandable idea, since support items and tank items generally cost less than damage items, but what if you were to take the idea that supports don't need gold and items **literally**?\r\n\r\nRecently, I've been experimenting by playing enchanter supports - mainly {{champion:117}} {{champion:267}} {{champion:37}} - where I buy {{item:3092}} {{item:3173}} before I stop building any more items and just buy Control Wards to get as much vision control as possible to compensate for my lack of utility items. \r\n\r\nI'm only doing this in normal draft pick - not ranked - (on my own though) and have been having relative success both in the laning phase and mid/late game. I try my best and otherwise play like normal and don't troll (outside of obviously not buying items). If someone notices that I'm not buying items and calls me out for it, I will say that I'm 'testing the theory that supports don't need items to be useful' and immediately use the gold that I've accumulated to get items if they're not happy with what I'm doing. \r\n\r\nI'm not suggesting that you should do this, but do you guys think that it's true to a certain extend to say that supports are still useful without items? I imagine that for tankier supports like {{champion:12}} {{champion:201}} {{champion:89}}, you probably do need tanky support items to be the tank, but with enchanters, where most of their power already built into their kit, is it feasible to use only your abilities and vision to support your team with this theory and fun little self-imposed challenge? \r\n\r\nAgain, I'm not saying that you shouldn't buy items as a support, but is there a degree of truth to the notion that supports don't need gold or items?","replies":[{"poster":"Room 36","date":"2019-09-01T00:28:49.145+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd have to disagree on that theory. I've had many games where well placed {{item:3107}} shots literally win teamfights. Or when giving my ADC the {{item:3504}} buff determined whether they got the kill or died.\n\nSupport items may not look like they're of much significance at face value, but towards the mid-late game they are essential.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zardo","date":"2019-08-31T23:36:49.803+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is very little truth to that statement. Riot has made many powerful support items recently...\n\nThat being said, they don't tend to do UNREAL damage so nobody else buys them and they also are cheaper than other items, so you don't need kills to get them, just your support items.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yrzen","date":"2019-09-01T13:27:27.578+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Supports, by definition, function well on a lower budget, letting you funnel gold into a champion that can better make use of that gold. When people say that Supports don't need gold/items, they mean they don't need them as much, since your team _should_ have greater success if the carry has more gold/items than the support. You don't need items to be useful in this game, regardless of your role, but obviously you're going to be much more useful with items.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lapis","date":"2019-09-01T01:22:05.434+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Some supports do need items. For example, I've been playing a lot of Yuumi, and she absolutely needs an Athene's Holy Grail, her heal is really weak without it, and then suddenly her healing is good, just from that one item.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-09-01T00:43:32.460+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The question is whether you want to perform well enough to succeed only in certain situations, or perform to the best of your ability you can so that you can succeed in as many situations as possible.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Death by Glamour","date":"2019-09-01T00:35:58.236+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well it depends, enchanters/karma really dont, sona is the exception as shes oom after 2 Ws.\n\nTanks as a whole dont bar taric who suffers from the same thing as sona, he just goes oom.~~~~","replies":[]},{"poster":"Baby Ghoul","date":"2019-08-31T23:44:21.819+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They do, but support items are cheap.\n\nBasically most supports don't need a lot of gold, so they don't need to farm or get kills.\n\nThe type of support that will need items to be useful is a mage support, and that is because their usefulness to the team is that they do damage. They aren't utility or protection based, and in this meta that works because the only thing assassins respect is damage.\n\nIt's also kind of why it's not worth getting yourself killed to try to kill something like an enchanter as they don't need a lot of gold, but you do. It's not a 1 for 1 trade. They should be taken out first, but I see a lot of people go so far out of their way to kill a protection based champion outside of the team fight context. They usually end up either dying without a kill, or dying for it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AlienPrimate","date":"2019-08-31T23:42:25.636+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Support items mostly have actives that bring more utility.  You don't really scale any differently without items on enchanters but you lose the actives from locket, redemption, mikael's, zeke's, and the passive from ardent censer and athene's.  These extra effects can be game changing a lot of times.  The actives from redemption and locket could turn a 5-0 ace completely around in your favor.","replies":[]}]}
