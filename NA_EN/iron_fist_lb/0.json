Yes recruit your friends - 3 votes gets action, 1 vote gets noted.\r\nRight or wrong is immaterial.\r\nYou don't truly find the time in a game to explain certain fundamentals to these lost souls, or show them how you truly are laughing that hard.\r\nThey come into champ selection selfishly. They ban dangers to themselves not to the team. \"I will carry you\" they say. Their logic is unquestionable because they are the duo. Never mind how rarely you've seen a duo actually amount to any thing other than two players nagging you now.\r\nYeah everything is on a video somewhere; how to play, who to play, how to play against who they picked...\r\nDon't be too creative; They'll come for your ribbon.\r\n\r\nJust a rant","replies":[]}
