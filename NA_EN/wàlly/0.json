That aside I understand that in your case you lost patience with that players behavior, and that's understandable. That said, if you had muted them and not engaged with them then chances are you wouldn't have been punished, which I realize is easier said than done but still though. Under normal circumstances you would only get a chat restriction for this log (assuming that's all that was said), but because you already had those plus a 2-week ban you were given a permaban as the next available punishment.\n\nAs for the escalation system yes I know it can feel frustrating to get permaed over something that would normally only get a slap on the wrist, however, you have to understand that players can't keep getting infinite chances, and Riot has decided that a person who still is acting up after a 14-day ban with no noticeable improvements despite knowing they're on thin ice should be permabanned since it's highly unlikely that additional chances will change anything.","replies":[{"poster":"Nørth","date":"2019-12-19T13:42:33.667+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":">Actually things like racist language, wishing death on others and gameplay-related offenses violate the zero-tolerance policy and thus get a 14-day ban as the first punishment since ideally one shouldn't need a warning to know not to behave like that.\n\nDon't mean to be a party pooper, but it's actually not like this.

Think of it like a health bar (or tension meter) in music games. When you hit the note at an off beat,  your tension meter  increases. When you completely miss a note, the meter increases by alot. When you hit the note at good timings, it reduces the meter. \n\nRiot's behavior system works the same way, as in we all have a toxicity meter attached to our accounts. When players are mildly toxic, it goes up a tad. When people use hate speech, it pretty much fills up the meter. of course, clean games reduce the meter. \n\nIt is possible for playerA to get punished and playerB not to, even though playerB was waaayyyyy more toxic . Let's say playerA started the game with the toxicity meter at 95% and playerB's at 35%. Ingame, playerB said some pretty nasty shit and playerA responds with some shit as well. After the game, playerA gains 10% toxicity and playerB gains 50%. Now playerA is at 105% toxicity and gets punished, whereas playerB is at 85%, and not punished in that specific game, even though playerB was found to be 5x more toxic than playerA in that game.","replies":[{"poster":"Wàlly","date":"2019-12-20T01:59:24.108+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"that actually makes a lot of sense, good explanation!

A dictionary-based banning program. It is, basically, a 'learning' program that identifies trigger words with correlation to reports. The rioters will not disagree with the bot. Years ago, this system was designed around behavior at the time. It was well designed and accurate. However, over time, the bot has broadly accepted any toxicity - no matter how slight - as universally BAD, with varying tiers of BAD. As players realized that they can contribute to banning others based on their chat, they've contributed to the bot accepting even minor degradation as punishable, particularly when the player in question repeatedly uses the same phrases and key words. In other words, the excessive reports, effortlessly processed by the bot, have compiled a blatantly pandering list of triggers. So, as stated, the rioter's opinion doesn't really matter- they must agree with the bot, if the bot says it was bad mouthing. All the rioter needs to do is to find some of those keywords the program identified and show it to you, then hands off, \"too bad so sad Charlie.\"\n\nThey will help if you can prove someone stole your account or some other extenuating circumstance.\n\nThe system is not being reformed, but Riot MAY be aware- or MAYBE becoming aware- that their current system is no longer as effective as it used to be.

There's only one way this is possible: without regard to context. Riot explicitly states in the ToS that context does not matter. Thus- the human side does not matter- if somebody regularly responds to toxicity with significant enough consistency, the program identifies the player as a problem. This is the greatest flaw of the system, it does not care why (or for what purpose) you're condescending or otherwise toxic. In reality, WITH REGARD TO CONTEXT, the system is not 100% accurate, because I can objectively argue why you specifically (among many others) should not be banned for such behavior, referencing discussions among the intelligent community concerned with online behavior. *Regardless of how relevant my argument is, if it isn't inherently wrong, the program is not 100% accurate.* My argument also has to deal with the system's affect on players. That argument is worthless, however, in likeness to my first response to you. Because I don't have a PhD. Though if I work on this enough it might get me one... in my dreams. A Ted Talk at best. Still dreaming.\n\nThe reason I explain that is, again, the system is hailed as 100% accurate, the replacement for Tribunal. There is only one reason they would claim it is. I'll point out that someone is getting paid for this program's success and someone else wants it to be toted as a success. The Tribunal failed at that. Keep in mind that League has a very negative reputation in the real world for its toxicity, but among the elite, they've managed to project League as an example of how companies should handle toxicity, with this program at the tip. The intelligent community will not read the ToS and don't know that the system has no regard to the human side of the veil of toxicity- and tragically, that community is all about the human side of things. That's really why they're all there in the first place. It's just a few who have the clout, import, and interest in looking good that are doing this. It's ironic that Riot's symbol represents clout.\n\nThat's not to say Riot is evil. Hell naw! They've got some good things going and have helped. Even the very program in question is ... WAS ... an advancement for player behavior. **A summarized answer to your first question** is that they are employees in an organization in which they answer to the people who in some way are paid for having an excellent behavior system. No overrides of the bot's judgement equals 100% accuracy (excluding extreme situations the bot could not measure). You seem to have already been aware of this to some degree. Emphasis *\"Too bad, so sad.\"* I would call you a sacrifice in the name of this 'excellent behavior program'. The punishments must flow, and none are exceptions in the bot's eyes. For cryin' out loud, they changed the ToS so that the bot's judgement is always 'right'!\n\nFor what it's worth, I think I could make a better system- with help.
