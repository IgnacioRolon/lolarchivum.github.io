The space on the screen where the chest was supposed to be displayed was empty and the number previously displaying 6 chests turned to 5, the key/key fragments disappeared as well. Nothing new in the loot. I relogged but nothing changed. I've also found a similar instance of this happening to another person on the board, but it seems they'd actually gotten a summoner icon and since it's automatically added to the inventory it wasn't in the loot. But i checked my icons and it doesn't appear there are any new ones.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-20T18:50:24.534+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're right that cases like this usually result from a surprise summoner icon, but I took a look into your case to see what happened.  I see that you currently have 5 mastery chests available to be unlocked.  Your most recent case that you mentioned yielded a shard for Nasus.  I was able to confirm this in your inventory.  Is everything okay now?","replies":[]}]}
