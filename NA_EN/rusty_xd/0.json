I got mail from Riot on Nov 8 and I sent ticket on the same day after referring to a pinned thread because I wasn't able to create an account that time.     \r\n\r\nThere are 2 possible outcomes when I try to register;\r\n1. When I'm logged into the website, and open the link to create PBE account from mail, i get stuck on second step of PBE registration which is \"Application Received\". \r\n2. When I'm not logged into the website, and open the link, it keeps me on \"I want to help\" page and clicking it will refresh the website.\r\n\r\nSolutions I tried;   \r\nUsed different browsers \r\nUsed VPN's to change IP(also suggested by support) \r\nUsed incognito + VPN and logged in \r\nUsed the Riot link provided by support which redirects me to the same \"Application Received\" page.     \r\nWaited 3+ days for the link to work.\r\nTried registration every 6-12 hours.\r\nChecked whether I'm on proper website(EUW) for 15+ times.\r\nGoogled every thread for people struggling to create PBE account and found multiple, too bad I'm one of them as well.  \r\n\r\nwhy me ;_;\r\n{{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-11T16:33:33.397+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The URL you are clicking through the email is not a token for your account, and is just taking you to the PBE page.
