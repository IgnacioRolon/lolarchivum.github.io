Not even 24 hours.\n\nRiot needs to start requiring you to **complete** games in the relevant queue to reduce the penalty. Even a 3 game requirement would fix the problem.\n\nHowever, you just have to wait until tomorrow and, boom. Penalty's completely reset to base value.\n\nYou can't have both a pathetically easy to reduce penalty alongside a pathetically small initial penalty. One or the other, but not both.","replies":[{"poster":"Micahmunch","date":"2019-10-30T16:51:23.379+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree. Queue dodge penalties should stack upon each other forever until they actually play games to reduce the stacks.\nI've been through 20 queue dodges now and one of them are mine because my team was {{champion:350}} top lane and {{champion:157}} support. I just wanna play the game. I have no interest in playing the character.","replies":[{"poster":"Yatol","date":"2019-10-31T15:10:00.772+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol that dosent even sound like an off meta comp, just a role trade.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Inkling Commando","date":"2019-10-30T17:27:36.363+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"it'll certainly shut up the players who say dodging is a viable strategy because they judge players off their rank and other stuff.","replies":[{"poster":"DuskDaUmbreon","date":"2019-10-30T23:50:27.688+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ally: *Has a 49.9% winrate*\n\nThose dumbasses: \"TIME TO FUKIN DODGE THIS TRASH BROKEN BIASED MATCHMAKING WTF RITO WHY WOULD YOU GIVE ME A MATCH LIKE THIS YOU FUCKING HATE ME AND WANT TO KILL  MY FAMILY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11\"","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ph03n1xb1rd","date":"2019-10-30T15:28:30.664+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, you just detected a flaw in their system.
