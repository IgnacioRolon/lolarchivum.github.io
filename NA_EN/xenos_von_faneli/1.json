Hoping something's busted cause otherwise I'm just very unlucky. Also pretty sure there's some icons I never got that I was supposed to.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-02T04:35:27.854+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel your pain Xenos-kōhai!!! {{summoner:31}} \n\nOnce you've gotten a few key fragments for the month, it can really start to feel like they'll never drop again. After getting a key frag, the chance for getting another is slightly lowered. This happens each time you get a key frag up until you've gotten your 12 for that month-ish period of time. The drop chance **does** reset every 28 days or so from the first frag you got, and then you'll be able to get them quicker again.\n\nI hope that, along with DTN's help, we've been able to clear things up.

It's also important to note that you can only get a max of 12 fragments in the 30 day period.\n\nFor more info on the Hextech Crafting and Mastery systems, read here; http://boards.eune.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/champions-gameplay-en/KZnWzcGK-hextech-crafting-and-mastery-frequently-asked-questions","replies":[{"poster":"Xenos von Faneli","date":"2017-05-30T21:54:16.053+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Deep Terror Nami,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=Ott0wKpe,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-05-29T22:30:03.992+0000)\n>\n> I know it can feel like the drop rate is broken sometimes, but it&#x27;s because the drop percent is not a flat rate; the more you earn the lower the chance to earn one becomes.
