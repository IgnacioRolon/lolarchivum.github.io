Anything we can do to speed things up or should we just keep grinding","replies":[{"poster":"SÃ¤rah","date":"2016-09-01T08:20:11.642+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"he could also transfere his acc to na","replies":[{"poster":"Xenos von Faneli","date":"2016-09-01T09:23:58.156+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"nope, that's the problem, apparently you can't transfer from the asian servers","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-31T22:35:23.940+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's a promotion for email verification that gives you a 4-win IP boost if you complete the process. Our announcement regarding this can be found [here.](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/riot-games/announcements/earn-4-win-ip-boost-verifying-your-email) While this won't help with XP, it will help get more IP quickly to grab some champs or runes.\n\nOutside of that, picking up some XP boosts in the store is the only other thing I can think of that would directly impact the leveling track. It shouldn't take too long, though, as we fairly recently cut the required XP to reach level 30 in half.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[{"poster":"Xenos von Faneli","date":"2016-08-31T22:54:23.758+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thanks, I'll at least try that promotion, the biggest problem at this point is just that he doesn't have his champion pool (or runes, masteries, etc.) also blind pick remains pretty toxic half the time.
