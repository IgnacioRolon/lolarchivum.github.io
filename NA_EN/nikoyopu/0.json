They need to go 3 cookies just to be healthy enough through their first run to not be susceptible to invades and be able to gank early. I feel like this mastery won't be better because of how much the cookies help them early. Any plans on helping these two? I enjoy playing them and they're iconic junglers... but right now they are struggling as hell.","replies":[{"poster":"EvilMerodach","date":"2015-12-10T17:47:29.716+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"As Panth you shouldn't be having that much health problems.\nCreep kite, use more q's to get his passive up, block more attacks from large monster, focus correct monsters, rotate camps better (he usually doesn't go krug/red/blue or gromp/blue/red like most junglers)\nCan't say about kha, don't play him...but defiantly panth, if you're low on health just jungling..you're doing something incorrectly. I've used 0/18/12 and 18/12/0 on him and not getting Secret Stash on either. Still enough health to keep jungling or gank without recalling till I need to buy something worth recalling to buy..","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sneak Dog","date":"2015-12-10T09:32:51.645+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"it seems a pretty great choice for sololanes.\n\nDoes it increase damage to non-champions?
