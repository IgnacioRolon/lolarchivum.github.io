I get you want them to be able to block shots and that you don&#039;t want it to be too OP at close range, but what about something like +5%-10% damage per extra arrow?  \n\nMy reasoning is a lot of the time from a practical standpoint it&#039;s probably going to be a tank taking extra arrows and they have the armor and health to deal with it.  Option B is it&#039;s probably an assassin who&#039;s going to 1 hit Ashe anyways so why not give her close range counterpunch to leave him just a little bit lower than he would be?\n\nIMO if you are going to make it so that more than one arrow can hit someone, the skill is a shotgun skill and it needs to work like one.","replies":[{"poster":"Kingsgrave","date":"2015-04-28T22:13:08.315+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":3,"body":"Shes not Graves.
