What&#039;s going on with her passive?  It seems like if she&#039;s going to be a tank, she&#039;ll need to keep it.\r\n2.  Her Q?  This is a good anti-tank skill as well as her primary damage.  I&#039;d hate to lose her TF-gunblade build.\r\n3.  What&#039;s going on her with her W and E?\r\n4.  We know she&#039;s losing her R, but that&#039;s going to be replaced with?\r\n5.  Currently Poppy builds a lot of assassin items (people like that more on her) with one or two tank items.  Her gameplay feels like half-jax, half-Vi, neither of which are full tanks (Vi builds warriors and TF in most games, if she goes cinderhulk she&#039;d probably replace warrior for a cleaver).  If anything, she feels like a dwarven fighter or beserker, someone who is a good mix of tank and damage.  Also she lacks a lot of reliable CC that a proper tank needs in LOL and to be honest that doesn&#039;t really fit her outside of the skill shot stun on her E.  \r\n\r\nRight now, Poppy is a lategame champ who mostly ults, charges in, and beats people to a pulp with her hammer while probably chasing down and deleting the carry if necessary.  That&#039;s not really a tank.  So how can you guys justify making her a full tank and what is her core gameplay going to turn into?","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2015-03-29T19:16:02.680+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":2,"body":"It's still too early to talk about all the specifics of the Poppy rework.

I don't want to sound like all the Poppy fans are broken records, but this is pretty the only information we ALWAYS get every single time we ask. Besides that, all we've ever been told, by [Morello](http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=3377668&page=6) himself is \"if Poppy ever sees [high level] competetive play, she will be nerfed so hard she would be like the next Evelynn\" and \"a poppy rework is expected before season 5\" Thankfully for the first and sadly for the second, so far these have not happened, but even any kind of update would be great, what are you struggling with? what ideas have you played around with? Is there some theme/ability that isn't working out?\n\n2. In this [interview](http://www.newsoflegends.com/index.php/tag/poppy/#4), it's stated you're aiming to turn Poppy back into a tank, but what kind of tank? [Here](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/champions-skins/champion-update/dev-blog-champion-updates) It's said \"Poppy looks like an armored and armed ball of golden death\" Is it planned for her to be the mundo \"be annoying with cleavers all day and just tank stuff forever\" tank? Or more like VI, a tanky fighter, capable of diving into the enemy team/towers and wrecking someone. I guess the question is,  is the plan to take away all of Poppy's damage and leave her just as a tanky frontliner, or a fighter? Personally I would much rather see Poppy as a fighter than a straight tank, because, aside from her assassin qualities, towerdiving is one of the most notorious things Poppy is known for (and i don't just mean her ult) ant it feels like a shame\n\n3. Please... please... please... I beg you all. If Poppy's E is the only thing that is going to be kept. Please put it back to a working order? Back in path 3.8. Poppy's Heroic charge was reworked to \"better detect terrain\" but now not only does it feel like it's gotten worse, It also seems to have the lowest priority out of any dash in the game. If her target a: dashes, b: dies, c: blinks d: sneezes too hard (riven) while Poppy is mid charge... she simply loses it and freezes mid movement. Every other targeted dash in the game at least continues on to the point where the target was (even if it's funny to see 2 Xin's switch place by dashing to each other) Poppy? just... freezes in place... loses a huge chunk of her mana and is kinda screwed. 8 seconds of immunity doesn't mean much if you can't catch anybody in that time. \n\n\n5. This is more of a personal request than a question, but one of my overall favorite things about Poppy is how she doesn't quite want to die when people think she's going to. Similar to how old Karma got stronger the lower her hp, or Trundle's amazing survivability with his ult+w, Poppy is very killable, and there are specific things like true damage, (I'm looking at you Darius... or ignite) that ignore her passive, but it always takes a bit more than most people expect. Some people may disagree with me here, but I believe that these things have been kept with both Karma and Trundle's reworks, and, even if it's in a different form than simply \"take less damage the less hp she has\" I would love to see that quality kept on Poppy as well.\n\nSorry this is a little long winded, but It's so rare Poppy players get any info at all. I keep trying to put her down because I don't want to get used to her all over again only to have her changed out from underneath me just when I was falling in love with her again, horrible early game and easy counter picks and all.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Capsom","date":"2015-03-30T20:14:10.484+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=h5xQa23B,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-03-29T19:16:02.680+0000)\n>\n> It's still too early to talk about all the specifics of the Poppy rework.

Don't get me wrong I like the way it feels if you can actually land it, but any form of dash or cc (other than stun i believe) cancels her only engage and her only cc and then she just gets kited. I don't mind that some things stop it but there are just to many things that do currently. Probably the most frustrating example of this would be Kalista's passive right now Poppy's main play style is to ult and dive the back line but if they have a Kalista and a mid with Zhonya's poppy becomes mostly useless. I understand that if there is no collision than it doesn't make sense for her damage or cc to go off, (and that you have had this exact problem with many gap-closers on many champions) but to have her only form of cc and engage to be cancelled so easily is one of the biggest problems with her as a champion.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ZylotheWolfbane","date":"2015-03-30T05:58:11.964+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's extremely disappointing to hear actually, because one of the coolest things about Poppy are her Passive and Ult, because becoming so difficult to kill, and peel is amazing.

Toughness at low HP, if she keeps it, would also work well with Sterak's and Maw, which suggest more of a fighter identity than a true tank (but not really a juggernaut, since she has a gapcloser, something more Renekton-ish, except for her lack of true sustain and her personality).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Venowolf","date":"2015-09-08T15:16:13.374+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dwarven warrior is the best thematic for her indeeed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"noobatallgames","date":"2015-05-31T07:41:12.985+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=h5xQa23B,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-03-29T19:16:02.680+0000)\n>\n> It's still too early to talk about all the specifics of the Poppy rework.

There are always op champs in this game and CC is so broken.... LOL u guys are so smart ur like \"cc is to weak/ broke... I know what to do! Lets make sure it can never be broke...\" Every pvp game understands this simple principle, CC must be put on diminishing returns! Figure it out. So cc champs get to be op as fck, but poppy cant. Currently poppy hasn't even came close to being viable. So obliviously her kits isn't as op as u think it is. Make her scale less and increase her early game and call it good. If she gets to the LCS then go ahead and rework her... With all the CC in this game some one can figure out how to stop her when she ults... Especially in high elos. \n\nIf you're going to change her that much change her name too ffs... \n\nAlso as an avid Poppy player it's very clear you have been nerfing her even more with secret patches. Some times shes stronger, other times not so much. I know for sure even when fed that you can't carry like you use too with her. So its clear you guys did something, but won't say (how chicken sht), and her charge lol is so broke sometimes it glitches out and wont stun for no reason, the collision is so small and that is another change that you guys mess with. When I first started it wasn't that hard to land a charge, now I can have someone against a wall almost and it wont register as a stun, you almost have to be on top of them now. Its so unbelievably inconsistent. Let alone the fact about ppl dashing or doing any sort of movement ability. \n\nIts like grow a pair and let her B, increase her strengths, and nerf her late game. \n\n\nIf you must change her; rework only her ult so it only avoids turret dmg or will take turret dmg or she can be targeted by the 2 closest champs.... Something along those lines.\n\nYou take away her ult and her passive then you don't have Poppy! PERIOD, PERIOD, PERIOD! She better not look stupid either, and I dont want every tom dick and harry playing her. So just leave her as is and make it so ppl who play her alot can be a bit stronger with her, yet not carry so hard. As is poppy is so weak in lane its unreal. I can tell you one thing though is that I've gotten really good at farming under turret.\n\nGuess what Morrelofail? How long do you think it takes Poppy to  buy her first item? Yeah it still hasn't happened that's how long!!!!\n\nOH yeah and another thing... You guys never I mean never make skins for her, nothing, even the store doesn't sell her merchandise... \n\nI'm so done with this. \n\nWaiting for a new pvp game to come along so I can stop wasting money on a game that is only concerned with generating new champs and skins just for the sole sake of revenue. You guys make more money per capita then any game I bet. Yet its so simple and there are so few things you guys have to spend it on. Yet you don't have the time or know how to fix Poppy ... \n\nUnacceptable!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nHows that for a nerd rage....\n\nFeel free to silence me, cuz that's what you have done with every legit response that calls out your inadequacy.

Make poppy v2 for do this U.U\n\n(cleaned up the english a little so it's easier to read)\n\nI both agree and disagree with you here, they've said they want to keep Poppy's e, so I pray they fix it so it's not so unreliable.\n\nfor her R, i'd love to see poppy still able to towerdive, but the whole problem is she does too much damage with no items, also it's almost impossible to stop her. The other problem is, and this touches on the second point, Poppy is not supposed to be and adc/apc. she was supposed to be a tank. While i would like to see her still able to deal damage, Riot has already said \"she will be turning into a tank\" i think the most we can hope for is that she's more of a bruiser like Vi, able to be tanky and still kill a carry, which i think would still be fine. \n\nFor Z, i think that's our w, it isn't required that every single champion have fancy mechanics, sometimes the simple 'run in and smash' character can be great too\n\nthe second point, like you said 'turning poppy into a tank would be like reworking talon as a tank' the issue again is, talon was supposed to be an assassin, poppy was supposed to be a tank, as much fun as it is to dive in and murder someone, it really doesn't fit thematically with poppy to be this invincible ball of death. I think the big issue here is, riot can either turn her into an assassin and kind of break the theme of her entirely, which they don't want to do, or rework her more into the tank she was intended to be, problem is, someone will be unhappy happy no matter which option they choose","replies":[]}]}]}
