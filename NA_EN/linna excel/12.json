Some of them simply have the ID of a champ that has long since been removed, filling in the gaps. Others are incremented to a number someone was particularly fond of.  \nI'm sure there are other stories why certain champ IDs are how they are. It'd be rather difficult to gather all of that info though.\n\nOn items, there are actually hints of a system. If an item is in the 1000s, it's likely a base item (or was). An item in the 2000s is a consumable. 3000s represent items that build out of other items. Otherwise, numbers are jumped over sporadically mostly just to try to keep items grouped together in manners that make them easier to develop on.","replies":[{"poster":"ploki122","date":"2013-10-24T04:05:50.512+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"*\\*glitters\\** O.O *\\*glitters\\**\n\nP.s. escaping characters is broken as hell.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Kira Onime","date":"2013-10-23T03:06:26.875+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not enough people use this platform to warrant an AMA here.","replies":[{"poster":"Zielmann","date":"2013-10-23T03:22:09.005+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Announce AMA on main forums, and reddit.
