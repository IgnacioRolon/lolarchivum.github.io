The problem with that was when I load up LOL the bottom part of the ingame item shop doesn't show up on my screen... so I couldn't resize it via the mouse because the mouse couldn't get to the one area to resize its height.  I mean literally more than half of the buttons for selling and undoing were off the bottom of my screen.\r\n\r\nIn the end, I had to make the game windowed, lower the resolution even more, that forced my shop to resize itself, and then go back to my normal settings.  Even though I could work around it, that wasn't the most intuitive option nor did I have any guarantee that it would work.  \r\n\r\nCan riot please add an easier way of resizing the shop for rare instances like the one I faced?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-27T16:31:30.520+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You might see resolution issues if you are using a 4K monitor, which is not something we currently support.  Aside from that, a resent Windows update has also caused some resolution issues, which we've found a workaround for:\n\nRight click the LoL icon -> Properties -> Compatibility Tab -> Check the \"Disable Display Scaling on High DPI Settings\" Box.\n\nI hope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2016-08-27T18:04:31.714+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nope, I went from 1920 x 1200 to 1366 x 768 and the issue popped up.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-27T18:13:02.926+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the update!
