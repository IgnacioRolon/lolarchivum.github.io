I've got no problems with the ideas that peculated to the top.  I'm happy for those people.\n\nHowever 2500 comments is a lot to go through.  I'm not going to lie, that's too much for me to look through and fairly judge.  The fact that some ideas can get visible is a benefit to the system.  However, it also shows an issue that if you don't post something that is popular early in a threads life your chances of getting noticed are a bit low.  \n\nPoor baconavia is just going to be forgotten in the mix.  This isn't because baconavia is a bad idea (I picked a red suggestion on purpose), but it's because baconavia wasn't posted quickly enough.  Had that idea been posted on day two, it probably would have gotten fewer upvotes...  You know, if a red didn't post it.\n\nHas there been any discussion about how to alleviate this issue?  I know there are a tons of great ideas I missed because I don't have time to look through them all.  You are pretty much stuck with best and recent right now.\n\nEdit: there is also no easy way to search within a thread.

As a traditional style forum poster and visitor of imageboards over leddit, I prefer the old way.  This format does have its advantages, I agree.

Occasional mods pop in to delete bad threads or move unrelated threads but GD has been entrenched as 'that place where you post if you want Riot to respond' because Rioters only respond there or the bug forums. If the boards beta becomes 'that place where you post if you want Riot to respond' you're getting a bunch of 'CHAMP OP PLZ NERF' and 'EAST COAST SERVERS WHERE' here. And it's easy to say 'oh, the community will downvote those' but in GD they tend to get lots of upvotes. \n\nI can understand wanting a new forum, after the terrible mismanagement and culture that's developed the old one.

It just LOOKS like they did.  This has been one of the complaints about the Reddit style board from the beginning.  The \"rich get richer\" problem.  If a thread only has a few replies, sure, better posts make it to the top.  The problem is, a week later, when the thread has a hundred or a thousand replies, those same posts are still at the top.  Not because they are necessarily better, but because they were the best of the first 20 or so posts.  NOBODY is reading the entire thread.  Do you understand that?  NOBODY.

Out of the later posts, chronological view may allow you to see, say, a skin idea YOU like and it'll get put in the works... but you won't get any idea of what the community wants.

I said, as I did months ago, that the \"rich get richer\" problem absolutely must be addressed in order for these forums (still refusing to call them by the dumb new name) to have value.  I don't think GD or the old way of doing the forums worked well.  I also don't think this works better unless you address the problems inherent in the system.  (Of course, at the same time, you could have just addressed the problem inherent in the old system and accomplished the same thing.  Riot's nerdgasm over Reddit is still something that eludes my understanding.)\n\nMy point is you AREN'T actually getting a lot more actionable information from the \"top posts\" feature.  The top posts in that thread have remained the same ALMOST THE ENTIRE EXISTENCE OF THE THREAD.  You've had to dig far deeper, and switch to chronological view, in order to increase the information you get.  The advantage of the chronological ordering of GD is that the most recent posts do get lots of attention.  Plenty of people would read the first page of a thread, skip ahead to the last couple of pages and read those to catch up on the discussion, and go from there.\n\nLet's compare the two.  Here, most posters are upvoting and commenting on the top posts... and you've been watching them do that for the entire life of the thread.  Every day, you check the thread and get to see, not what new skin is rising in popularity... but how many more people joined the circle jerk of whatever the top posts already are.  In chronological view (with that as the only option) you see a lot more discussion on the final pages about more recent skin ideas.  Yes, in both, some get lost in the cracks.  I'd argue fewer get lost in the cracks with the chronological view than with this boondoggle.\n\nSolutions?  That is tough.  I've thought about it a lot and come up with very little.  A significant daily decay in the upvotes of a post could help... or a system where the average upvotes per hour are calculated, allowing new posts that are getting a lot of attention to rise the top where more people will see it.  As those posts get older, and if you don't allow multiple upvotes from the same person, the upvotes per hour will drop and another post will rise.","replies":[{"poster":"IronStylus","date":"2014-08-11T00:12:46.723+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":3,"body":"The solution is to do the manual labor of going through the thread.

If you stopped replying, this thread would die almost immediately, and would quickly drop off the page as more champion suggestions (that I'm pretty sure Riot doesn't even look at on principle?) come and go, washing this thread away with them.\n \n> I don't think there's any evidence, at least that would convince me, that this format hurts discussion.

Things stay on track, interactions have been polite and spirited and discussions have been easily tracked.\n\nAnd in my experience, I've watched utter nonsense threads stick on the front page for days while legitimate discussion gets upvotes but not comments and slides away into obscurity.\n\n> Also, considering I've experienced **none** of the toxicity I've run into in GD over in this neck of the woods,\n\nWe've had this conversation before.  Over the past 5 years, Riot staff have (unintentionally) conditioned the forumgoing playerbase that if you want Riot to read what you type out, you have to post it in GD.  This leads to anyone wanting anyone to read anything needing to post it in GD.  Because the overwhelming majority of people are in GD, the trolls will be in GD.  Combine that with the...  lackluster moderation over the years and you get today's GD.  I'm really tired of hearing this implication from Tamat that GD is the spawn of all evil because it's GD.  It got this way because of how Rioters interacted with it.  It didn't just magically occur on it's own.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Angry Monster","date":"2014-08-11T03:13:45.192+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think your POV is a little slanted here. As the OP you are getting a msg of every post that is throwing an idea at you. You get to see a new reply directly to your post. \n\nBut for the people that are coming in it will not be doing that. They are going to see the Top 50 so posts and then leave it at that. The top post are usually posts that come for day 1. This is cause those early posts are going to get more visible traffic. If someone has a great idea day 3 or POV on a topic responding directly to the original post is not going to get seen by many people. Their are people that have been reading and up-voting specific posts and they are at 10+.\n\nThis board rewards people who were first. Sure people have to vote but i have seen people up vote some really bad ideas before. You said again in this thread that the community will filter. This has never worked before and will not work with Riot. \n\nAccording to some poll data most of the forum goers are 15-18. So you are asking people that as a culture that we say are not legally capable for their decisions, to filter things for on the forums.

It's really that simple.\n\nI´m pretty sure everyone wants their voice heard, though this sort of is a problem here - as the first voices will become the loudest voices very quickly + there´s no option to bump a thread if you posted it on a bad time to be heard (low activity)...so the only option is reposting the same thing over and over. Not sure if that´s a great solution.\n\n>The same concerns I've heard about the discussion format are the same problems I've experienced on GD. \"Circlejerks\", upvoted/bumped spam, voices not being heard, etc. Those problems exist and worse on GD in my opinion as things currently stand. \n\nNot disagreeing here entirely, but that´s just the problem I have with the Boards currently. Instead of trying to fix some issues that are present it seems like all you want to achieve is recoulouring the same old thing. So the Problems remain on the new Boards aswell\n\n>I don't think there's any evidence, at least that would convince me, that this format hurts discussion. My experience has been different.\n\nThis is another part where I think the Boards are pretty imissleading:\nYes, it´s very conveniant to have a 1 on 1 Discussion, as the personal inbox makes it very easy to follow responses and respond to them. Really a great improvement right there...the problem however is, the discussion shifts into privacy if it goes on over some back and forth, no matter how good it is. In the GD-format the discussions where a lot more public and visible...here they tend to disappear behind a big wall of \"show more\"-buttons, no matter how good they turn out to be (long back and forths tend to be the most productive sort of discussions, at least if both sides are open-minded)\n\n>Also, considering I've experienced none of the toxicity I've run into on GD over in this neck of the woods, I'd say the experience has been pretty good. Things stay on track, interactions have been polite and spirited and discussions have been easily tracked.\n\nI think this really comes down to the people attending the Boards, not to the mechanisms of the Boards itself. As a F.E.K. user i only have a small amount of People in the GD Blacklisted and it is quite a peacefull place for me most of the times with some rather good discussions (and some nonsense here and there, but well...it´s GD after all). I too enjoy the atmosphere on these Boards currently, no doubt about that - but it is really unrelated to the deeper problems that run with the visability-mechanisms.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI´m really not opposing these Boards...I like the coulours, I really like the inbox (though for me personally the my-updates page seems to be down today for some reason) - I think it has great potential. But I also think it needs more confidence to aspire sth more than being a sort of reddit 2.0. THe current Format doesn´t solve any issues the old GD had, it only recolours them.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"LeeDark","date":"2014-08-11T00:47:29.328+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"Oh, okay... so there isn't actually any interest on the dev side for improving the boards during beta.

You and the other devs can keep living with the delusion that Reddit style is amazing and not try to fix any of the problems that have been pointed out with it.

There is no way to know how many upvotes an idea, that now has 30 and was submitted one day after the thread was made, would have had if it had been one of the very first posts. It could be anything from a hundred to thousands. Because of this you can't really get a true estimate of how many people really perceive the idea as good compared to others.\n\nI do understand that you can never just compare ideas based on the amount of upvotes only, and I understand that you may only be watching for ideas that have achieved at least some popularity without really caring if it has 20 or 20 000 upvotes. If that is the case I fully understand why you prefer these boards. However, looking at your posts I see that you normally \"market\" these new boards by saying that it makes it easy for you to see popular ideas. This is very easily interpreted as \"This board tells us which ideas are good\" (which I think/hope  you don't mean) or something similar yet not so absolute. This is something most people (in my experience at least) disagree with and why you are facing so much critique. \n\nAlso many people would love to see a skin idea come true and are extremely discouraged because like-minded individuals didn't find your thread in time and now their supported idea has pretty much no hope of ever getting enough upvotes to even being seen. What makes this worse is that people have no idea how long devs actually follow a thread. We hear all the time that your forum time is somewhat limited because nothing gets done if you only read suggestions. How are we supposed to know if you actually have time to go though our feedback before starting your iterations? Also as human beings we know how tedious it can be to go through endless feedback, most of which isn't that great. Most people can't honestly say that they would read too many of the \"buried\" comments, which normally means that neither would you.\n\nIn the old forums you would actually know that your response has with all likelihood been read if a dev posted after it or quoted another posts from the same page as yours etc. If he didn't say anything about it you knew that he didn't like your idea enough to respond (of course there were some idiots who kept reposting until the irritated developer gave a response but those were pretty rare). Now we are left wondering if you have even seen our post, which is frustrating.\n\n------\n\nKind of a long post but I have seen you arguing about this subject for such a long time without any progress in making the other guy understand why you like these forums, repeating the same vague and easily misunderstood (sorry...) lines that I had to share my opinion on why it keeps happening.\n\nAlso sorry if the text is hard to read/clunky for I am not a native speaker.\n\nTL;DR: Post \"Community beta is a worse user experience for a person trying to actually give input after the first day\" #1623417376","replies":[]},{"poster":"Earl Eulrich","date":"2014-08-10T10:57:46.717+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well...1000individual posts sort of force you to get your attention to all of them the same if you want to be sure you don´t miss sth. excellent.

There is no situation where this is currently sustainable, considering chronological *still* won't stick. That's getting pretty old btw. \n\nBy the way, I would consider Chronological view a form of surrender, personally. If it is doing better than default, then why *isn't* it the default? I could postulate something as petty as pride, but I believe the issue that Riot can't/won't give it full functionality until leddit mode (LoL reddit) is perfect, which in my eyes seems incredibly biased.\n\nBottom line for my thoughts on this, is that nothing new was discovered here. You still need the old chronological posting to find the newest comments, and you only get a relatively small percentage of data readily available with leddit. This is with the comunity actively trying to help you sort it, unless I misread that point. And this is with \"ideal conditions\" so to speak, where are input is essentially the same format. The moment you hit something like a discussion with multiple views, the whole thing falls to peices, as Leddit only holds the Sheeple view highest, and Chronological currently doesn't support following any form quoted content.\n\nI'd say if you really want to test what I put above, make a simple discussion thread, like \"Which is better, the Sun or the Moon?\" Then see the thread entirely in leddit view, then entirely in chrono view.
