I guess the first thing we need to do is define a paladin.  I&#039;m not going with the full-tank guy that MMOs use.  That&#039;s an Mud/Mush creation for the needs of that genre, which got ported into MMOs because of an intelligence cascade.  I&#039;m thinking more of a PnP style fighter with fewer combat tricks but a little more utility and specialized damage.  \r\n\r\nIn LOL terms we are probably looking at a sustained damage AD bruiser with a little bit of utility (like a heal or AoE aura).  \r\n\r\n**How do I get to this?**\r\n1.  Paladins are guys in heavy armor, sure.  Full plate and a shield baby.  Or full plate and a big sword.  That&#039;s not the whole story though.\r\n2.  However they also have evil smiting skills as well as a holy avenger (bonus damage against evil).  He can turn undead (make them go bye-bye), but not as well as the cleric can.  He&#039;s not just a tank, even though he can do that, he&#039;s got decent sustained damage by wailing away with his sword every turn.  Basically he&#039;s got specialized damage for the things that need killing.\r\n3.  Yes paladins have a healing skill and/or an aura of some kind.  Maybe they&#039;ve got a little magic, but it is more of an emergency back-up for the cleric in the team.\r\n4.  Don&#039;t ask me why they get a horse when they are running around in the narrow confines of a building or dungeon 90% of the time.  I think that was a bad mechanic to reenforce the knight in armor shtick.  However, a knight on horseback with a lance in the middle ages was the equivalent of a heavily armed tank with a huge ass cannon stomping your average soldiers into the ground.\r\n\r\n**So how do some of the current LoL champs stack up?**\r\n{{champion:86}} - well, he&#039;s got a self heal, tank, and a smite but he&#039;s too much of a tank.  He&#039;s not quite right\r\n\r\n {{champion:39}} - she&#039;s tanky, does damage, has some utility in the form of a heal and variable CC, but she doesn&#039;t have the right theme overall which is the issue and her heals are too selfish.   She&#039;s probably the closest one right now.\r\n\r\n {{champion:10}} - she&#039;s got a smite, sustained damage, utility, she looks right... and she&#039;s an AP glass cannon.  Nope.  \r\n\r\n {{champion:89}} - she&#039;s tanky (but not quite unless really fed).  She has utility in the form of CC (no heals though).  She looks right.  Her ult screams smiting evil.  But she&#039;s not a sustained damage dealer... her kit wants to be a CC assassin/bruiser, she plays like a knight charging in, but she&#039;s a support/tank.  \r\n\r\n{{champion:78}} - A dwarven paladin?  Well she&#039;s tanky.  She does damage and smites people with her Q (for now).  She looks right for the job with the hammer and shield.  Her charging in is about right for the knight charge idea.  No utility so she doesn&#039;t pass muster.  Her background could lend her to being a paladin of justice though.\r\n\r\n{{champion:44}} - Well he&#039;s got armor.  He&#039;s got a heal and a stun for utility.  He&#039;s not a front-line damage dealer though.  He&#039;s a worse PnP paladin than leona and more of an MMO style meatshield.  \r\n\r\n**So where does this leave us?  **\r\nI think for balance reasons, a Paladin is a tricky beast to pull off.  I mean of the 6 champs I listed, not one of them builds a lot of AD aside from Irelia or Poppy.  Irelia and Poppy can also build more as tanks with TF and aren&#039;t always full bruisers.  2 are stuck as support tanks (free Leona) which isn&#039;t right for a paladin.  Leona can build bruiser in the top and jungle, but she doesn&#039;t go into those lanes much.  Kayle is an AP glass cannon and is right out.  \r\n\r\nIt feels like Riot is dancing around a paladin without getting the formula right.  \r\n\r\nSo how could that be done?  Well the easiest way is to give poppy a heal in her rework, overloading something if you have to.  That might not be right for her because she&#039;s more of a dwarf warrior and not quite a paladin.  Thematically... it might fit her nicely with her old backstory.  Option 2 would be to encourage leona to be less of a support and more of a bruiser and maybe give her small AD scalings in addition to AP.  Now she&#039;s popular as a support, but I would argue that&#039;s because she plays more like a bruiser and she is gold dependent like one too.  However, she&#039;s  in a good spot so I wouldn&#039;t mess with her on that alone.  I think a switch would suit her well, but riot hate supports with a passion especially when they leave lane.  The other champs wouldn&#039;t be as easy to tweak.\r\n\r\nSo what would I build a new paladin champ around?  First I think I&#039;d start with the following 4 things: tanky but not an MMO meat shield, sustained damage but not an ADC, some form of heal or utility maybe as an aura, and smite evil in the face with a big sword.  They are also leaders or inspiring figures, you can&#039;t leave that out if possible.  Build wise I think you&#039;d make a champ who gets 2 defensive items, boots, two offensive items, and one optional item for the match.  He shouldn&#039;t be too tanky such that he can only be a meatshield and his base damages should be low enough and his scalings just high enough that he can&#039;t be a full tank for his role.\r\n\r\n**Kit idea**\r\nPassive -  Every time you AA, allies near you gain X health.  This would reinforce his role in the front line and take care of the heal.\r\n\r\nQ - A damage spell on lowish CD (for the TF users) and resets your AA.  Think Poppy&#039;s Q or Vi&#039;s E.  I&#039;d want to put a passive effect that scales off of AD to reinforce you aren&#039;t just a tank but that might be a bit much.  Maybe bonus damage against enemy champs and the dragon/baron only?\r\n\r\nW -  I&#039;d like to see a melee ranged stun or silence that&#039;s on a medium CD.\r\n\r\nE -  A hard engage skill like Leona&#039;s E, Poppy&#039;s E, or Vi&#039;s Q.  \r\n\r\nR -  An active aura that gives nearby allies tenacity, armor, mr, and maybe a small shield or a heal if there isn&#039;t an AoE heal in the passive.  This is a leadership aura that would work with the idea of a leader on the battlefield and give the right utility in the right skill slot.  Paladin&#039;s need to be heroes and this would have the heroic leader feel to it... he&#039;d be the guy in the front rallying people to him.","replies":[{"poster":"Trylobyte","date":"2015-04-24T15:00:56.403+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"League has different types of paladins.  Paladin is a general class, not a narrowed-down specific concept.  I like the fact that League has managed several takes on the concept.\n\n{{champion:44}} is a defensive paladin.  Heavily-armored hammer-wielding support fighter.  An all-around nice guy you wouldn't mind letting babysit your children, but could also trust to have your back on the battlefield.  He doesn't hit as hard as a dedicated melee fighter, but that's because he's not that type of paladin.  He'd rather keep his allies safe than kill the enemy.\n\n{{champion:10}} is an offensive paladin.  Trades defensive prowess and super-tankiness for being able to charge into the fray and smite the enemy with righteous fury.  She still has elements of defense and protection in the form of her heal and her ultimate, but even those tend to be used best in an offensive way (the heal for chasing, the ultimate pre-emptive to a dive).  She might be a glass cannon, but how much does that matter when she can kill her enemies before they can touch her?\n\n{{champion:86}} is a tank paladin.  Tough, durable, and hard-hitting on top of standing up for truth, justice, and the Demacian way, he's pretty much what you'd expect when you think 'D&D paladin.'  He has no real supportive abilities, but that's fine since he intends to charge into battle himself and strike down the enemy, protecting his allies simply by being between them and the enemy and by being too much of an obnoxious beef-wall for the enemy to get past.","replies":[{"poster":"Thanotos Omega","date":"2015-04-24T20:55:40.863+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you forgot {{champion:89}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Angry Monster","date":"2015-04-24T10:30:15.170+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not going to happen with your definition of paladin.\n\n>In LOL terms we are probably looking at a sustained damage AD bruiser with a little bit of utility (like a heal or AoE aura).\n\nThe heal is the deal breaker.

It just won't happen, first they'll rework Taric, then we'll see if they find someone else to fill the void (if he gets locked into support that is)\n\nPersonally I've always been a fan of the Paladin class. I see them as warriors (not necessarily huge knights) with some support mechanics. I'd imagine something along these lines:\n\nPassive - righteous strike (gains stacks each time he is hit by CC, dealing damage with each AA he hands according to these stacks - or spending the stacks)\nAlternative passive - AA's return CC and DoT from himself to his targets\n\nQ - See no Evil - dashes forward with a self blind, removes all other debuffs from himself & nearby allies (like immediately next to him)\nW - Speak no evil - next AA (casts silence and deals light magic damage to target and in a small area behind them)\nE - Hear no evil - sonic shockwave that repels enemies and projectiles (like a 1 seconds face the wind) \nR - Cleanse - Cone base skillshot (removes DoT damage from allies with small AP scaling healing, removes buffs from enemies and ends channelled abilities - too bad Olaf :D )\n\nHe/She would be less tanky then Leona, Taric or Braum, but not squishy with maybe 50% defence stat\nTheir skills scale with AP, but more utility that damage, most of their damage would come from AA procs, AS and building some AD\nTheir purpose is the ultimate \"anti-cc\" champ, playing support they can protect their adc from almost anything, and has some survivability but can't tank for a team \nAs top, they have basic escapes, and their anti-CC skills can make ganking hard. But they lack \"brawling power\" making them better late game in team fights.\n\nThe Q stacks the passive, and if used to dash past an enemy, you can use E to knock them back, before the blind wears off and you can then attack. W can break the affects of Blind, allowing for combo skills with Q W E then pull back. \nIn theory should lose top lane brawls and be forced to play safe, but brings a second support style champ to the late game that can dominate teamfights, with a passive that could potentially lead to massive proc damage.

But Saying leona isn't tanky made it hard for me to keep reading.\n\nOn the other hand, Taric has the potential to be a big damage dealer, his problem is lack of mobility means if he's winning, his opponent just takes two steps back and pokes him until he's out of mana (i mean even trydamere can use that tactic) and if he's behind, he can't escape, so he doesn't have many \"plays\" that could turn the situation around.
