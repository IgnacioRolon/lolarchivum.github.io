Or more specifically I&#039;m not totally sold on why it is used in most cases.  What&#039;s the point of using a variable form of damage that putters out as a fight goes on?  For instance if it is anti-burst, can&#039;t riot come up with a more elegant anti-burst effect?  I can understand %max... that&#039;s anti-tank.  %missing?  Finisher.  \n\nWhy does %current health belong in the game?  What&#039;s the main purpose of front-loaded damage?  Why would I as a player want something that isn&#039;t going to help get me the kill or assist towards the end of the fight and keep the other guy alive, what&#039;s it in for the person using it?\n\n{{item:3153}} - This one I kind of understand, if only because it is an ADC item and they like building crit and armor pen.  This is the most justifiable case I can think of, but only because of the main champs that get it have other ways of blowing you up: {{item:3031}} until riot does the sword of epic badassery.\n\nFor an ADC, this item is compensation for all those times your IE/SS didn&#039;t crit to begin a fight... but ADCs are the main ones with crit so after them, I have trouble seeing the purpose of this?\n\n{{item:3151}} - when I see it ticking away on a minion for 1hp a second but not killing the minion, I want to cry a tiny bit.  I want to say this is an item for either CC tanks or CC supports, but it&#039;s not really common on either type of champ.  Mumu and Sej get it, but only at 8% buy rate or less.  Zyra gets it too, but it&#039;s uncommon on her.  Teemo gets it, but I can&#039;t stand that little fungus crapper.  I want to say people like this more for the little bit of stats everywhere and the DoT more than how the DoT is applied.  If you don&#039;t have built in CC, then you have to get rylai&#039;s and now you are wondering into AP bruiser territory.  \n\n{{champion:28}}&#039;s ult.  I am not a fan of her ult for a lot of reasons.  The spell shield makes people want to tank as her.  The %Current damage is weak on an assassin at best.  This feels like a hard initiation ult for someone who isn&#039;t meant to do that but is forced into the role.  Evelynn really doesn&#039;t have the base damage in her other skills she needs for this to be a good ult for her.\n\n{{champion:60}}&#039;s human Q.  Elise needs a lot of TLC right now.  That last nerf kind of splatted this bug-girl (spider-girl).  I think part of her issue is her human Q feels underpowered to me and this is part of the reason why.  She also gets Liandry&#039;s a lot so this is like a double whammy of puttering off.  I can kind of see the risk/reward of this when you figure in the spider&#039;s Q and it&#039;s backloaded damage but right now, the human Q doesn&#039;t feel rewarding and overall elise just doesn&#039;t feel like she&#039;s in a good spot... She&#039;s the new urgot as far as win-rates are concerned.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2015-04-18T21:18:01.143+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":1,"body":"We put % current health damage on spells when we want those abilities' effectiveness to be independent of how much health the target has or hasn't stacked and: \n\n* The spell's intended to be used early in a fight as a core part of the champion's play pattern. Xin Zhao's ult is a great example of that - % current health damage reinforces the message that the Armor/MR bonus already sends, rewards using the ult to make big early plays that split teams.\n\n* The ability's deliberately being made weak (or non useable even) as a finisher. Elise for example is rewarded with extra damage for going into spider form against weakened opponents, as her human Q damage drops off and spider Q damage increases. Evelynn's the more extreme example, with her ult being explicitly designed so that she can't get kills with it outside of her Q range and is instead rewarded for flanking a fight and going in as soon as things kick off.\n\n*  The effect's intended to be strong as a softening effect, but drop off in effectiveness as enemies get worn down. This mainly just applies to poke effects, like Mundo Cleavers or Liandry's Torment (whether on poking casters or early into the fight champions). Diminishing returns against wounded targets means the poking player's got a strong incentive to eventually use more of their kit/have their team follow up on their engage. Additionally, targets of the % current damage get a bit of help if they're taking continuous hits and really struggling to engage or disengage.\n\n* We're looking to incentivize splitting hits between targets a bit, in a way that wouldn't normally be smart. Jarvan's passive offers a bit of this in that there are times when, rather than just training one target down, it may be worth swapping to another for the passive proc. A minor opportunity for play optimization under some circumstances basically.\n\n\nAdditonally something we haven't used % current health for in a big way, but might at some point, is as a kill set up mechanic. Imagine a support for example with a powerful % current health nuke, possibly even as an ult. Intent would be that they'd soften a target up for a team mate (assassin would be a good fit) to then follow up on.","replies":[{"poster":"Mandaari","date":"2015-04-18T23:37:17.411+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"Why don't you use % bonus health for mechanics targeted toward high health champions?

I see your reasoning behind it, but if I'm not playing a hard initiator like Sej, at least personally ults are things I want to hold on to for the right moment.  But then again, I play a lot of champs like Soraka, Ahri, Janna (love her in ARAM), etc.  Even Shyvana doesn't always want to start a fight with an ult.  On Sona I kind of like her ult more for peeling than initiation as fail flashing only gets you flamed hard on her (I've seen LCS players fail flash on her).  In other words if you play too many champs that don't want to start a fight with their R, having a % health ult is just weird.\n\n>The effect's intended to be strong as a softening effect, but drop off in effectiveness as enemies get worn down.\n\nThis is why I think this is a tanky initator effect.  You don't need to survive as that type of champ (but it helps).  So you are more concerned with early damage.\n\n\n>Imagine a support for example with a powerful % current health nuke, possibly even as an ult.\n\nDepends on the rest of the kit.  If it's weak damage, heal, utility skill, I wouldn't want an ult that I had to toss out immediately. \n\nMorgana's ult could be a possibility... 5%-10% for each part of damage on her ult if you don't want her going mid anymore.  He isn't a support, but Amumu's ult would make sense as he's the hard initiation type.  \n\nI think that could work on a new support though and now I kind of want to see that.  \n\nHowever based on what you said, I'm not sure you should put it on the ult, put it on the Q and make it a spammable skill shot.  I'm only saying that because as a support if I toss out my ult, I want it/need it to have a big effect because I'm probably guarding the carry, an assassin/bruiser who is low but can one shot the carry may not fear my ult if I'm the only one to properly react to him.  People can complain about kill stealing all they want but I'm going to protect my carry and an ult that won't let me do that can get lost...  winning the team fight and protecting the carry is more important that who gets the kill.  80% of the time as a support, that's what I'm aiming to do.  Ultility mages who turn into back-up mids wouldn't be happy with that either... they want to finish off people now because they get strong when fed.\n\nSo for myself, I'd be more comfortable with % current health in the QWE.  I also think that the core of a champion's kit is in their QWE so if you want a player to do that, it needs to be there.  Going back to evelynn (still don't like the ult) she's a close in fighter and the current ult reinforces that as you said.  So if you want % current on a support, start trying to put it in the QWE.\n\nIn such a case as a % current ult on a support, I'd have to be the initiator to want that and that's where things get hairy. _ I'm totally fine with initiation supports_ but it has to be clear I'm playing someone who wants to all in at level 6 and is able to do it well even if not fed. The other possible case is if I'm playing a siege cannon for my team.  Maybe like a support form of Kog who doesn't finish people off on his own. \n\nStill, I think this needs to be done on a more offensive oriented (HAM?) support and not someone you need to peel and even then you would only pick him if you've got a jungler or top who can peel.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Flemman","date":"2015-04-18T22:06:56.280+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I always saw that kind of damage like the \"Super Fang\" of League, here to shred life by fixed amounth to allow carry to easily kill them","replies":[]},{"poster":"El Dez","date":"2015-04-20T01:01:11.020+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since you're around, I've been wanting to ask about Vayne's Silver Bolts. I know they do Max HP True damage rather than current HP, but that's what's always bothered me. HP shred is a counter for stacking health and True Damage counters stacking resists. That means that Vayne counters any manifestation of effective health. I'm not saying she's broken, she has short range and the true damage only activates on the 3rd hit, but her entire kit consists of effective tools to deal with both of those factors. My question is how do you, a designer, see a person dealing with that? The easiest answer is hard CC, stuns and roots keep her still long enough to damage her. However, both of those are predicated on being able to hit or otherwise target Vayne (things she's very good at avoiding). I find it frustrating when a Vayne is ahead and there's nothing I as a tank can do to itemize against it. I don't have this problem with BotRK's because the passive is current health and both the passive and active (max health) are physical. Now I understand that Vayne has a weak early game and that there are things that can be done to prevent her from exploding.
