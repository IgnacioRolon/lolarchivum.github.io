I see you are trying to solve the case of the missing elements! Let's see if I can help you at all. Here's a couple of questions for you (just to verify it's not on your end):\n\n1. Which browser are you using?\n2. Can you provide a list of extensions and plugins currently loaded into your browser?\n3. When the page loads, are there any errors shown in the javascript console? Read below if you aren't sure how to check this.\n----------------\nHow to view your console:\n\nOn Chrome:\n\n* View > Developer > Developer Tools\n* Click the Console tab\n\nOn Firefox:\n\n* Tools > Web Developer > Web Console\n* Click the boxes next to Net, CSS, and logging to disable them","replies":[{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2014-10-05T16:34:54.803+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm using Firefox 32.0.3\n\n>Using //@ to indicate sourceMappingURL pragmas is deprecated.
