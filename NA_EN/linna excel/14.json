You should go for something that comments on humanity and makes people think.  Maybe allegorical for real life events.  Take Godzilla.  When it was released, the fire bombing of Tokyo and two cities getting nuked by an unstoppable war machine Japan had provoked was fresh on everyone&#039;s mind.  A giant monster that Japan was unable to defend against made sense for the time.  Poe&#039;s writing worked because it dealt with madness most of all.  Lovecraft worked in the form of hint unreliably after you&#039;ve built a base of madness.  \r\n\r\nPyke seems like a satire aimed at 12 year olds.  &quot;I got fed to the fishies and now I&#039;m back for revenge, garr!&quot;\r\n\r\nOn that note, he looks rather human for a walking pile of fish shit.  I mean you&#039;d think after the Last Jedi debacle, your hype team would know what Checkov&#039;s Gun is by now.  If you are going to hint that he was eaten by a giant fish, then I&#039;m expecting something that would look digested, or at least thoroughly chewed up and missing a chunk of his body and not a generic bloated corpse that drowned.\r\n\r\nNow if you want to go with drowned corpse coming back for revenge, then you needed to have shown that he died by drowning or freezing to death in the water.  Get rid of the fish entirely.  Maybe put a few obvious holes in his story, just enough to make him seem unreliable.  Better yet, make him have gone crazy and then he jumped off the ship.  Something terrible happened on the boat in the middle of the ocean and he tried to escape the only way his panicked mind would allow and now he&#039;s back to warn others about whatever it was.","replies":[{"poster":"FauxSchizzle","date":"2018-05-10T18:39:03.123+0000","up_votes":24,"down_votes":1,"body":"Who said he was digested?","replies":[{"poster":"GenoXx","date":"2018-05-10T18:57:37.313+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I got it.

It's just a rule that occasionally works, mostly only in situations in which pacing and time or space restraint is of utter most importance, but otherwise it's not strictly needed to be followed to create a good narrative.\n\nFor those who don't know, Checkov's Gun is a rule that goes as follows:\n\n> Remove everything that has no relevance to the story. If you say in the first chapter that there is a rifle hanging on the wall, in the second or third chapter it absolutely must go off. If it's not going to be fired, it shouldn't be hanging there\n\nIt's a good rule of thumb to look to to remind the writer to at least do some proper fat-cutting of stories and designs to avoid bloating, but there is otherwise no need to specifically tie everything directly to the narrative, or at least not all the time. For instance, a short story would benefit the most from this rule, whereas any things like the storyboard for an exploration RPG wouldn't mind lots of detours.\n\nTo some extent we can apply to this Pyke guy.

Being dicked on should make him ANGRY and STRONGER), and worst of all of this, they have the nerve to use time bullshit as an self-excusing justification for their absolutely awful writing. \"It's the only way... so every dumb shit we do is actually the only way to lead to victory, and all my mindblowingly brain drain writing is actually the best\" You fucking wot?\n\n.........\n\nI also don't really get the hate for TLJ. Sure Rose is a COMPLETELY UNNECESSARY character who only exists to pad the story in rather uncomfortable ways; I mean, she's both a PETA advert, a plot padding machine with worse display of character than Jar Jar, and a complete nuisance that exists solely to annoy and go against everything Finn says and does, why are we expected to like her? Sure Snoke was a complete let down, hilarious memes even. Sure the casino bit of the movie almost shouldn't exist, or at least could be cut by half and would make no difference. Sure the purple hair chick 'fake suspense' section could literally never happen if she just told the others the fucking plan she had, instead of acting like a douche and refuses to say anything. \n\nBut all of this are imo nowhere as bad as TFA has collectively represented. Because not only TFA is a shallow rehash of ANH, it makes absolutely no sense (the setting, the plot points, you name it) while bending established dynamics of the title whenever they please, and creating this gigantic rambo power fantasy where the only take-away is that \"Rey is amazing, she literally does everything in the story and everybody else is kind of just there\". That's far more insulting than TLJ, because at least The Force, the good o' Force vs Dark Side is actually a thing now in TLJ unlike TFA, and story actually progresses and pushes the narratives forward into the next big stage, AND it ended semi-conclusively with the stuff presented in the movie itself tying up for the most part unlike TFA which just dumped a bunch of utterly ridiculous shit and never bothered to go back to them and just ended the movie in one of the worst cliffhanger ever. \n\nI find JJ's \"mystery box\" approach (I'm not putting words in his mouth. That's his words) far more insulting than R.Johnson's whatever philosophy, because R.ohnson actually tells a story meanwhile JJ is entirely content with just doing his lootbox shit with 1 box in another box like a fake carrot on a stick. JJ doesn't even seem to attempt to tell a story but rather he's more about just holding baits to lead the audience around in circles (and neither leading them absolutely nowhere or the worst payoffs), it by all accounts of nature make his TFA far worse than TLJ imho.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"WOOOOOOOOHOOOOOO","date":"2018-05-10T19:29:41.004+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Makes sense","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2018-05-10T19:59:18.995+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"For the purposes of this thread it was the part where you see Luke's Xwing in the water, but nothing comes out of it in the story to follow.","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2018-05-10T20:19:09.479+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Linna Excel,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=00Z3aO4k,comment-id=00040002,timestamp=2018-05-10T19:59:18.995+0000)\n>\n> For the purposes of this thread it was the part where you see Luke&#x27;s Xwing in the water, but nothing comes out of it in the story to follow.\n\nIt was there to build up the eventual 'subversion of expectation' in the last action scene.
