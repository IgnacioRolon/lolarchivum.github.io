For example does bork's passive work?  What about the Spellblade passive?  Critical hits?  Hydra's AoE?  Hurricane's bolts?\n\nThen you've got things like Orianna's passive, MF's W, a few of Jax's skills, Yi's E, Irelia's W, Janna's Shield, and Nasus' Q which also do things to your auto attacks.\n\n@riot\n@rito","replies":[{"poster":"Phreak","date":"2014-06-18T23:21:38.388+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It works exactly like Lifesteal would work:\n\n* Mystic Shot, Parrrley, Double Up, and Hurricane all work\n* Bonus damage from Critical Strikes works. I believe Sheen/Trinity Force also.\n* Empower, Ruined King, etc all do not vamp.\n* Anything that amplifies your champion's actual AD stat (like Janna shield) works, whereas Nami's buff would not.\n\nI'm actually unsure about Ravenous Hydra. I could see it either way, but I am guessing it would not vamp anything from the splash damage, either passive or active.","replies":[{"poster":"Jamener","date":"2014-06-19T14:34:48.602+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh! Could this be a great item for Ezreal maybe? What other champions did you have in mind when designing this item?","replies":[{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2014-06-23T19:14:07.540+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ezreal is okay with the item.  Some people are trying blue build again with him with ER replacing elder lizard.\n\nIt's good on Ashe, Sivir, and maybe Varus for ADCs.  I need to try it on MF who I think would like it.  Vayne might like it only if it helps her Q more.  Caits like to get it if they get hurricane so they can Q more as well.\n\nPoppy likes it, and I think Jax, top Vi, and Irelia would too.  It'd probably be good on a top champ who needs to lane against a manaless champ.\n\nIt's also a good item for AD casters: CDR on AD champs is hard to build for.  This, 5% mastery, black cleaver, and Ionian boots means you've got 40%.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2014-06-19T00:42:33.878+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay, it working like lifesteal seems fair as an effect.  \n\nThank you for answering Phreak.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Cosmic Warper","date":"2014-06-19T01:05:35.583+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Although it's severely cost inefficient mid-late game and basically a noob trap, it may be good on ezreal since his Q applies it.

With this, he could split push even harder without going OOM. That's about it though. Otherwise, a very lackluster item. Give it a minor item with that passive, building into Essence Reaver, sure. As was pointed out by a previous poster, though, is that you need mana regen early game, but by mid-late, most every champion just stops having mana issues.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2014-06-18T22:54:48.732+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay, I just did a test and it appears to work with hurricane.
