So let me rephrase that into LOL terms:\r\n\r\n> *A parasitic design is one in which the mechanics force players to play with, and only with, the passive effects in question.*\r\n\r\nSo how is Hurricane parasitic?\r\n\r\nSimple.  It's all about on-hit effects and only on-hit effects.  70% attack speed?  More on-hit effects.  The passive?  On-hit effects all around.\r\n\r\nI think that is the item's core deficiency and what is making it sub-par to other items.\r\n\r\nThat's how riot really screwed this item over.  Yes it has potential, but when all is said and done, it is really a parasite of on-hit effects.  Aside from Bork, ADCs rarely get items with on hit effects.  Even Elder lizard is total crap on them now that it lost its sustain.  ADCs don't get cleaver.  They don't get frozen mallet.  Ranged AP champs?  Not very many get Nashor's tooth, the only on-hit effect AP champs really care out.\r\n\r\nHurricane really multiplies on-hit effects which are few and far between.  ADCs have better items to get.  AP champs need raw AP for late game more than they need more on-hit effects.  Since hurricane doesn't give move speed, AD, AP, CDR, or Crit it's sole purpose is to multiply on hit effects.  But there aren't many for the two groups of champs who can use it to get.\r\n\r\nI think this is why it largely remains a niche item.  In order to shine it needs items or kit abilities with a specific trait and since those are few and far between, this item isn't as good as it was intended to be.  That's why it never became the Hydra for ranged champs that Riot wanted.  Hydra gives raw damage and sustain.  TBH if I were behind I'd be more tempted to build Hydra on my ADC than getting hurricane.  Hurricane is trying to multiply for what a lot of ranged champs is a big fat 0.\r\n\r\nAnything times 0 is 0, and that how the item fails.","replies":[{"poster":"Phreak","date":"2014-02-19T00:22:21.842+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":5,"body":"I think you're right on some of this, but I disagree with some of your positioning here.\n\nItems shouldn't be ubiquitous. I don't want to buy a Sunfire Cape on Ashe. That's not a problem.\n\nThe goal for Hurricane is not for AD Carries. They already have great multiplicative scaling. Even if Hurricane could crit, you're still better off adding IE, LW, or PD than Hurricane. And I don't think we intend to multiply them further anyway. So, that's basically \"Working as intended.\" Same for Mages.\n\nYou could try to make a case for on-hit Kog, Jinx, or MF... In fact, you could try it on Graves and get a hell of a lot more dashes out there. This is all fine and interesting. Graves players can opt into mobility in an item choice.\n\nHowever the main positioning of the item is on AP-Autoattck/On-Hit champions. Guys like Teemo, Kog, Kayle. Guys where you can buy {{item:3115}} Nashor's, {{item:3124}} Guinsoo's Rageblade, {{item:3153}} BotRK, etc.\n\nNow, it just so happens that Kayle players just abuse high AP ratios and Lich Bane to oneshot people instead, but generally speaking, Hurricane is there to give a real multiplier to On-Hit type champions. It's a sort of lynch pin item.\n\nIt might just be underpowered, but I personally find the design interesting in those realms. I think niche items are cool.","replies":[{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2014-02-19T01:15:26.104+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"But on-hit builds aren't the viable way to play them.

I would like if it were possible to build AP-Onhit Kog'Maw. I think it'd be a fun play-style.

Both are similar, but need to be balanced differently.  Then there are AP, AD, and hybrid champs.  Each group has items they tend to buy and not buy.\n\nSo the next logical question to follow up yours is how do we make on hit builds for each group in a healthy manner.  AP champs want some kind of AP.  ADCs what AD, AS, and crit%.\n\nAnother thing you need to ask is what are things we want this group to do and what don't we want it to do.  Frozen mallet has a nice on hit effect.  I don't think any ranged champs get it though.\n\n\n\nOh and Phreak, I totally agree if Kayle's or Jinx's explosions splashed, it'd be a broken item.  There are limits to what any item should do and I'm fine if neither of those things splash.\n\nOne place I think it'd be possible to have an on-hit effect is a flat life gain or mana gain effect that the doran's items have (in lieu of life steal or spell vamp).  Keep it small and scale it to level and it might work as a nice level to add to an item.","replies":[{"poster":"Goth Skunk","date":"2014-02-22T15:34:41.244+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The splash from Jinx's rockets **is** counted as an on-hit effect, though.\n\nBecause this would never fly with my team in Summoner's Rift, I tried it out on the Howling Abyss: I built the following, in this order:\n\n{{item:3070}}  > {{item:3004}}, then  {{item:3031}} > {{item:3035}}  > {{item:3085}} \n\nPeople thought I was a total n00b for building Tear of the Goddess on Jinx as a first item, but I turned on Fishbones and never looked back (except to siege turrets). Once I bought Hurricane, it was absolute mayhem.\n\nThe splash from Kayle's autoattack is NOT considered an onhit affect though, so the projectiles from Hurricane do not add secondary splashes with her attacks. Nevertheless, it is still a very powerful item for Kayle because in a teamfight, the two targets standing closest to whoever she's swinging her flaming sword at actually take *more* damage than the person she's attacking.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LeeDark","date":"2014-02-19T07:49:54.670+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So, sorta Warwick's passive, in an item.

Her autoattacks with a charged up E deal physical damage, magic damage, splash magic damage in a small radius, and shred the armor and magic resistance of her target, ensuring that additional attacks on the same target do more and more damage. Additionally, to the best of my knowledge, Kayle is the only champion that makes use of the Blade Weaving and Spell Weaving talents in the Offense Mastery tree simultaneously each time she attacks a champion with a charged up E. So not only does her target get weaker with each attack, she gets stronger.\n\n{{champion:17}} Teemo is an on-hit champion, but his Toxic Shot is a permanent passive on-hit ability, not a spell, so he does not benefit from the same Blade Weaving/Spell Weaving mastery synergy that Kayle does. That being said, he does a ton of on-hit magic damage and DoT with Toxic Shot, so building an on-hit build on him is effective. His attack range is only 500 though, so when up against any marksman (save Sivir and Koggy) he has to put himself in danger anytime he wants to trade, making him an ideal counter to a top-lane melee champ.\n\n{{champion:96}} Koggy's abilities all deal magic damage and only living artillery benefits from additional AD built from his items. Once his W is activated though, he gains additional attack range and an on-hit ability that deals a percentage of maximum HP each attack in magic damage. When maxed out completely, his attack range becomes 710. His W is just like Kayle's E in that it empowers his autoattacks, so in theory this should also trigger both Blade and Spell Weaving masteries. However unlike Kayle, he can never have this ability with 100% uptime, even with 40% cooldown. It has a flat 17 second cooldown, with 8 seconds of uptime. 40% CDR would reduce the cooldown to 10.2 seconds, leaving Koggy without the ability for 2.2 seconds.\n\nBuild him with these items: {{item:3020}} {{item:3115}} {{item:3100}} {{item:3135}} {{item:3085}} {{item:3089}} \n\nFor the record, this is the exact same build I build on Kayle when I build her for sustained teamfight DPS as opposed to 1v1 dueling.\n\nThis build boasts a total of 299 AP off of items alone, and when built on Kog'Maw, deals **9% of the maximum health of three targets in close proximity to one another every attack** when his W is active (with an added up front burst damage on the first attack because of the Lich Bane proc). Given that Koggy can proc Lich Bane with insane frequency due to the low cooldowns in his kit, I am *shocked* that more people are not playing him more often. His only weakness is his early game, which because of his short attack range of 500, is *painful.*\n\n{{champion:21}} Miss Fortune, with an AP build, can also be made to work. (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Q5t-P6xe_E&feature=youtu.be) SivHD did a humourous video commentary on it called Spellfisting with AP Miss Fortune. The items are outdated, but the idea is the same. However most players do not consider AP Miss Fortune viable because unlike most other On-Hit specializing champions (exception {{champion:61}} ) MF needs multiple consecutive attacks on a target to do more magic damage on hit, whereas if built straight AD, she can deal punishing damage straight out of the gate.\n\nNevertheless, an on-hit Miss Fortune would have other strengths over her AD counterpart. Make It Rain is seen as an ability that simply makes chasing an AD MF difficult, but with AP MF it is alarmingly powerful. The skill itself lasts 2 seconds, and ticks every quarter of a second, doing a maximum of 310 magic damage with an 80% AP ratio if caught in the entire duration of the ability. It also slows, so if she has {{item:3151}}  in her inventory, she will make use of its full damage output.\n\nThat's all the room I have for this post.","replies":[{"poster":"LeeDark","date":"2014-02-24T05:00:44.999+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately, those ideas all completely ignore a large portion of the on-hit items in the games.

However I don't think there's enough play room within the realm of on hit items and champs.  \n\nI guess I think that most items should be able to justify themselves on their own terms and not be dependent on other items or kit abilities.  If not there needs to be healthy support for them.\n\nIf we had a larger group of items or more champs who could justify it, that'd be fine.  But it seems like there aren't enough champs with kits that would justify it and if they do, the item has a high opportunity cost as there's other stuff they can do.  For instance it'd work on Orianna {{champion:61}} who builds Nashor's, but she rarely builds nashors and can justify another AS item.  It's something I want to try out when I get her, but I've got other champs I want first.  \n\nItems are the same way.  Right now aside from Bork, cleaver, and on a few champs Nashors, most on hit effect items themselves are pretty niche.

Hurricane *only* gives AS. I'm not saying Hurricane should be another zeal item, but it lacks so much in comparison to what you're giving up.  \n\nOn hit champions have historically been pretty weak. Items with on hit effects only scale off of attack speed. The sole exception to this is the new Nashor's Tooth. ADCs scale off multiple stats that all scale with each other. To top it off, on hit effects generally do not affect structures.  \n\nAnother problem with on hit champions is that their stats and kits generally aren't really cohesive with an auto attack heavy playstyle. If you look at ADCs you usually find long range and/or some mobility. Kog has the range without any mobility. Teemo has some mobility and a pretty good kit for dueling ADCs, but severely lacks range and can overwrite his own dot with repeated attacks against the same target. TF has pretty lackluster range and no mobility. Kayle on the other hand has strong scalings with her abilities, can kite well with her Q despite her range, and doesn't lose damage like Teemo does.\n\nWith all of these problems together on hit just isn't a very effective mechanic.

I believe ruunans shuld be relooked at to solve problem for certain characters vs just being on-hit based.","replies":[]},{"poster":"NeroUS","date":"2014-02-20T20:43:44.936+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem with niche builds at the moment is that they are almost never used and even when they are used its questionable whether they are better than the standard builds.\n\nReally, riot needs a larger number of items to play with so that they can diversify the picks more. I think it would be healthy for the game to have 10-15 more items; these could then be made to enable more hybrid builds.\n\nHybrid builds in turn would give Riot room to diversify the champion pool by increasing the number of ADCs that scale with AP. An item that gave Crit and AP would be a good item along these lines.\n\nIt would diversify bot lane a lot if Hybrid Ezreal or Tristana or Kog'Maw was viable, especially since there are many more AD choices elsewhere on the map. It might even open up opportunities for new champions to enter the ADC role like Kennen, TF and Annie.\n\nMoreover, it would make both the standard builds and new builds situational without a 1 size fits all solution.\n\n{{champion:96}} {{champion:81}} {{champion:18}} \n{{champion:85}} {{champion:4}} {{champion:1}} ","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nightmanflock","date":"2014-02-19T23:07:50.421+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Am I wrong to think that this item, in the right circumstance, can actually be pretty damn usable on a Caitlyn (for all the headshots) or Kog'Maw, even if build AD, because of his W?  It also helps Ashe kite like no tomorrow with more frost shots.  Am I saying it's a good buy every game on these champions?  Not by a long shot.

Sure.  \n\nCan you win with it?  It has a good win rate when you do get it, but I think the people who do get it are usually ahead and trying to finish off the game.\n\nIs it optimal?
