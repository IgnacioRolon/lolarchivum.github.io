Can't figure out why.  When I launch the game I get this:\r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/yZqe04z.jpg\r\n\r\n1.  I've got a tedious workaround where every patch I have to add firewall exceptions.  I don't do this on my PC and I don't want to keep doing this on my laptop.\r\n2.

It's possible that an outside program could be blocking you, but in those cases I don't believe the patcher would have even launched.  Regarding your firewall, you can download our [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) to automatically configure your settings and hopefully allow access.  I also recommend checking out our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide in case you may be able to troubleshoot or change some settings around for a fix.  I hope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2016-10-05T20:25:54.444+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"No luck.
