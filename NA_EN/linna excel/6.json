Are you going to bring more skill to champions that have a higher learning curve (e.g Katarina) but simple and easy to get used to kits so you could reduce how fast there assassination timings are?\n\n-Deatmaster Kat :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Arakadia","date":"2016-08-11T07:54:35.099+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Where can I find a list of  the assassins being worked on if theres one?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Solideus","date":"2016-08-11T07:25:35.211+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Apropos of nothing, your Ziggs-icon is what I imagine you are like as a Lead Gameplay Designer; a mad, diabolical yordle mastermind!","replies":[]},{"poster":"MunchCrunchLunch","date":"2016-08-11T07:03:37.978+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=03NgpcUo,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2016-08-11T05:56:50.531+0000)\n>\n> We&#x27;ve got directions for the kits, with some specific changes we&#x27;re pretty confident in and some stuff that&#x27;s still in testing.

They tend to avoid too many specifics in these posts so that they can change if it turns out that the idea doesn't work out.  If, for example, they had said, \"Talon's E will drop a field where all his autos are dashes ala Rengar from a bush/stealth\", but then figured out that it wasn't a good idea, people would complain about a bait and switch.  This way, they have a skill set in mind, but can change it if need be, as long as they stay in the general direction they specified.","replies":[]},{"poster":"legionnaire99","date":"2016-08-11T03:36:53.146+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"there not going to tell us in till they are out (on pbe) like every new champ and every other update","replies":[]}]}
