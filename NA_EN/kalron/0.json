But I can't left click the mini map to move my camera. I know I can click on the map to move my champion, which I disabled, but I don't want that. I looked over the settings menu through and through and I swear that I can't find a setting that allows me to click on the map to move my view. Is there a way that I can fix this? It's honestly one of those things that makes me not want to play because I can't watch just my character or scroll my screen to go watch something else while I move.","replies":[{"poster":"The Space","date":"2017-01-16T05:30:55.455+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you use origin or have played a game that uses origin before you play league the bottom left corner of the game is unclickable which bothered me but it's easy to fix, got to task manager and end origin running in the background but if that doesn't solve your problem then sorry mang.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-13T04:44:25.617+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you undo the previous configuration you made to disable right-clicking on the map, does it fix the issue you're having left-clicking the map?","replies":[{"poster":"Kalron","date":"2017-01-14T17:25:43.221+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No. I tried setting all of them back to the default settings but it didn't fix anything.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-15T22:08:42.118+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm... I'm curious if a background application is influencing your ability to interact with the minimap. I'd like you to try a temporary [**clean boot**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting#wq3) to ensure a background app can't cause issues for you.\n\nLet me know if this caused any change.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
