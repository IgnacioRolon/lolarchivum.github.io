For some reason, my game client went super small (almost as small as my steam friends list and everytime I tried reverting it back, it would completely revert my whole settings (FPS cap, anti-aliasing, graphics, etc) When I finally did manage to get it into fullscreen I could not move my screen. It was stuck in the same position and I couldn't make it pan even when I went into free cam\n\nhttp://prntscr.com/ewws5n\n\nhttp://prntscr.com/ewwq3n\n\nhttp://prntscr.com/ewwqnj\n\nhttp://prntscr.com/ewwqtb\n\nhttp://prntscr.com/ewwu4q","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-16T01:35:51.648+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Something may have gone wrong with your config files that are causing the league window dimensions to go a little.....screwy to say the least. Let's try resetting those config files and that should force it to reset back to default. \n\n- Log into the game client\n- Navigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\n- Delete the file  named **game.cfg** and **persistedsettings.json**\n- Go into a custom game and verify that settings have saved properly. \n- Leave game to sync settings\n\nLet me know if that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"I Watch","date":"2017-04-16T02:18:01.213+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It works thank you!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-16T02:37:45.365+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}]}]}]}
