HAHAHAHhahahaahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahah hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha, hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahah, hahahahahahahahahah... hahahah... haha... ha... ha.... ha....\n\nomg I almost died there.... \n\nI think people crying to riot for reports about every little combination of our 26 letter alphabet they can think of, claiming it's violence and abuse and flaming and should be punished... is exactly the side of this argument that is illogical and \"wahhhhhhhhhhhh wahhhhhhhhh\". And I think the irony at having somebody try to straw man their way into calling the other side of this argument the cry babies is the funniest thing I have heard since George Carlin died.\n\nIt's LOGICAL that instead of perma banning anybody and everybody who says anything in a game that might possibly could somehow offend somebody (not naming any names) you should just mute the player.\n\nIt's REASONABLE that riot would stop banning the \"upwards of 90% of players who receive permanent account suspensions are not trolls but regular players frustrated with the game\" and start banning the people running around trolling those regular players into trying to use words (like a grown up person) to get their team to stop throwing a game and work together. There is a reason most perma banned players play at an LCS level (Anybody remember Tyler who only played Draven? Troll of trolls but his mechanics and skill were definitely pro level) because we ban the people who care MOST about the game.\n\nIt's COMMON SENSE to stop banning players who care the most about the game. The ones who yell at their team mates are doing so because they REALLY WANT TO WIN. Look it up, the data is everywhere to back me up on this. Toxic people are toxic because words SHOULD be the method people with COMMON SENSE and REASON and LOGIC use to get their team to smarten up. It's really the ONLY method one has to try and influence their fellow players. They are mad because you are ruining their games and they are yelling at you because they want/need you to get better and stop making mistakes that throw their game. They care the most. Yet we ban them for communicating because certain nameless and unspecified individuals are too sensitive and not mature enough to handle that communication. The funny thing about being offended is it's completely subjective.\n\nIf the color blue offends you, do you think it gives you any right to make everybody else stop wearing blue? It doesn't hurt you or impact your life in any way, do you think it is reasonable or logical to force your sensibilities and personal offenses onto the rest of the world? Any thinking individual would consider this absurd.\n\nSo how could a thinking individual, who possesses the faculties of logic and reason, ever think for even a moment that you being offended by a word or a letter combination should entitle you in any way to force your personal delicate sensibilities on everybody else?\n\nShould we all stop eating steak because babies can't chew it? Some people simply aren't mature enough for language in general, let alone language on the internet. And it is not logical, rational or in any way sensible, common or otherwise, to think that censorship is the answer.\n\nDo you know who we should censor? Children. Small children. Children who are immature and undeveloped. It is our job as adults to protect children from sensitive things that may negatively impact how they mature and grow, because they are in a delicate state where they are not strong enough or mature enough or in possession of enough reason and logical understanding of their surroundings to withstand those influences.\n\nAre you a child? No? Then why do you insist on being treated like one?\n\nI suggest a solution; all children have to play their own league of legends, and only mature adults capable of chewing steak should get to play together. Everybody who bans/reports/cries for words that can't be said in a 14A movie should be kicked out of adult league and forced into kiddy league. Where they should also remove all smoking, alchohol, cleavage, flesh above the knee, blood, gore, dead bodies and violence.\n\nSo we lose Gragas, Singed, Talon, Urgot, and pretty much any other champ who doesn't throw bananas, but at least nobody can be offended that way. Is that the game you want to play? Because LOGIC and REASON and COMMON SENSE say that if we continue on this path of violently suppressing all free speech and non-conformist thought on the basis it may offend the more immature, undeveloped individuals in the player base, that's exactly the game we're headed to.\n\nPeople who cry and report for language should be banned from the internet. Since that's not possible, we should at least ban them from grown up league. Quick riot, make a new game client for the immature gamer! You've already got the chat system for it figured out. Then slap an \"M for mature\" rating on league and let the grown ups go back to playing without fear of a perma ban for criticizing their team mate just because they actually care about winning the game. I am SO SICK of this cry baby attitude on these forums and in the game.\n\nTL, DR; offended by language? Go play my little pony or farmville, League is full of flesh, blood, booze and adrenaline. It's no place for children and I for one am beyond fed up with hearing all the crying over something as pathetic and pedantic as \"WAH WAH HE SAID A WORD THAT HURT MY FEELINGS! I AM OFFENDED, DO SOMETHING WAH WAH!\"","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"AngrychickÃ©n","date":"2017-07-29T22:06:42.956+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Wait, your saying he doesn't sound smart and then proceed to use tho, u, tolk, 1, any1, uncapped I, some1, smthing, and team all flame and u oly belive.\n\nThe irony of your comment.\n\nOh, and you deserved the ban.","replies":[{"poster":"xxxxxxVIPxxxxxx","date":"2017-07-29T22:10:57.035+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"here we go..anothing guy who wants to say smthing wrong to sound smart...\nwhen i said sound smart...i ment:\n\nthe way he writes\nthey things he say\nthe rare words he uses\nor grammar\n\npick one that u think i was refering to","replies":[{"poster":"AngrychickÃ©n","date":"2017-07-29T22:17:22.830+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your use of ellipses really annoys me.\n\nAlso, he wasn't as you say \"sounding smart\"\n\na) He writes like a normal human\n\nb) What he said made complete sense\n\nc) Wait, he used an uncommon word?
