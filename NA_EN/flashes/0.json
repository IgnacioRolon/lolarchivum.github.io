Most memorable was when a Yasuo was shitting on a Nami (She was a great support) for \"never landing her ult\". She lands a 5 man ult on her VERY NEXT ULT, and he doesn't even ult. Lee, Nami, and I all called out his bullshit. This was ranked, and I'm just so mad that people can go 2/8, and still say that they're not at fault for anything, while flaming others for playing badly.\r\n\r\nThat is not to say all yasuo players are toxic. I've played lots of good games with Yasuos that never get tilted, even when they're getting camped and have no way to outfight harass, but every time someone IS toxic, for some reason it's a Yasuo.\r\n\r\nThis includes people I've partied with. When they play Yasuo, they're super toxic, but when they don't play him, they're fine, and that confuses me a little. Is there something tilting about playing Yasuo?","replies":[{"poster":"HonorIsNtheHeart","date":"2019-01-28T17:16:41.108+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"its not the player. its the person playing the character lol. i play yas (250k) and im a pretty mellow person. everyone tilts playing league but i dont take it out on others nor do i let other people's toxic attitude influence my mood/gameplay. just mute and move on. report if you feel the need.","replies":[{"poster":"Galaxyburstz","date":"2019-01-28T17:29:09.069+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"True, if you think Yasuo players are toxic, just wait until you meet high elo teemo OTPs, they know how to tilt the most tiltproof players into oblivion. {{champion:17}} {{summoner:14}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"R107 Games","date":"2019-01-28T17:31:48.297+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yasuo's kit attracts players that like to show off/try hard/carry. So it is likely that a toxic person will play him.\n\nAlso his gameplay provokes toxic behavior because it is reliant on play making, and he is useless when behind.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Batpool Uchiha","date":"2019-01-28T20:03:18.586+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"tbh if yu see the /yasuomains subreddit everyones very welcoming. its the stigma people put on himlike i could be carrying and i makea cal and everyone says stfu. or if im getting camped which happens a lot and im behind my team doesent see why im behind all they see is the score. but as yasuo the thing that pisses me off most is when bot and top come mid at like 8 minutes and take first tower to fuck me over. and when i ping my team they just mindlessly farm. and thats when i get tilted and get a bit toxic. otherwise most yasuos i know are chill. even when my teams behind i encourage them to keep going.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GreenKnight","date":"2019-01-28T17:07:49.489+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbUz-6caOY4","replies":[]}]}
