Some games, my frame rate starts to go to about 20 around mid game and usually tanks to &lt;10 late game. Anyone know what could be causing this? It almost always progresses as the game goes on, and I don't know why. Sometimes it's fine, other times it makes the game unplayable. I have graphics on absolutely lowest settings despite the fact that some games I can run it on medium-high settings absolutely fine, and the fps problems persist. Can anybody point me somewhere?","replies":[{"poster":"Im Genie","date":"2016-12-17T03:20:23.405+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i have no idea the game work perfectly before Riot update new client, it mess up everything. i don't understand why server is not working fine but they didn't fix it from patch 6.23 until now","replies":[]},{"poster":"DU Baymax","date":"2016-12-16T04:24:47.416+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Side note (similar but probably unrelated) the new client is laggy as balls for me while the old one was fine.","replies":[]}]}
