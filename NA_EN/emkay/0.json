I don't see a click down arrow menu to change the item sets while in a game. I've searched in my game folder and I see the itemsets json file there and opened it with notepad to see if it is the right one. Indeed it is but yet when I enter a game, it doesn't work.\r\n\r\nDoes it have anything to do with me installing the game on a different hardrive? Previously I had the game installed on c drive but I reinstalled on d drive. I thought item sets were saved on client side and not based on my files though...\r\n\r\nThank you for your time.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-29T23:46:47.798+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Item sets are saved server-side, and it sounds like the item sets file that is currently on the cloud is corrupted. We can reset this, but you'll need to create your item sets from scratch. You can complete this process with the steps below:\n\nFirst,  **log into the game** then navigate to your League directory, which should be here:\n\n>**C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends**\n\nDelete the folder named **CONFIG**\n\nOnce you've deleted that folder, close the League client, then relaunch it and log back in. Create a test item set for all champs on any mode, then hop into a custom match to confirm the reset worked.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[{"poster":"AcRo1337","date":"2017-02-24T15:56:33.066+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"All of my settings got reseted.
