It often happens that the wallpaper only displays on 1/5 (more or less) of the screen, while the rest becomes a blue screen with white dots. to solve it I have to open any app and drag it to the left or right side of my screen and then the wallpaper comes back to normal, only to bug out again soon after. Any ideas?","replies":[{"poster":"pachiporomari","date":"2017-12-27T00:18:28.967+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like some files might've been corrupted the first time it was installed.
