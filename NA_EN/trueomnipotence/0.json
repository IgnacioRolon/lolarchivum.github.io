Urf definitely didn&#039;t feel like this the last time. The game is ending wayy too fast. This mode has actually brought me back to this game quite a few times. Not this time. Idk how or why it&#039;s like this but it&#039;s shit. I used to rag on anyone who would q for urf and do nothing but split all game, as if it was there modo in life to win no matter the cost. I could give fuck all for winning at the cost of a fun game.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-06-29T21:42:47.641+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The whole point of URF is way too fast..\n\nThat said, it has not really changed since it was added 5 seasons ago - back then the whole game was much slower, so URF was also slower.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PhantomGG","date":"2018-06-29T21:42:53.687+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":".......\n\nUltra\nrapid\nfire\n\n\"way to fast\"\n\nTHE GAMES NAME IS LITERALLY MEANING FAST","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shukr4n","date":"2018-06-29T21:42:53.159+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well reading boards it seems sr last 20-25mins.\nConsidering urf is faster it is not so shocking","replies":[]}]}
