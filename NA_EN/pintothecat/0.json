Before preseason we used to be able to buy 3 champion shards and re-roll them into a new random champion. Understandably with the new preseason update that mechanic was taken out, but i recall there being a buy random champion option in the store immediately after the update as well, which cost 3950 BE. Has that also been waken out of the game? and will it return? I rather liked being able to buy champions randomly if i didn't know which i want, and it was cost efficient since I only have 4800 and 6300 champions left to buy. Thanks for any help guys!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-01T03:10:11.931+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That specific item was only in the store as a part of the [**Blue Essence Emporium**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/115014872088) which left on Nov 27th.","replies":[{"poster":"PintoTheCat","date":"2017-12-01T18:55:17.986+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So it's gone for good?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-03T21:25:21.464+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd say yes, but a lot of people thought it was gone for good before it came back in the BE Emporium! For *now*, it's definitely gone, but there's always a chance for it to pop up for special shops like that one!","replies":[]}]}]}]}
