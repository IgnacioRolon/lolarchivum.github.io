I dont mean like make her weaker but, like adding mana or energy to her kit. I played this one game and a riven just constally spamed her q then won the game with just her q. Riven is op enough without her q because her kit has stuns, getaways, and lots of sustain. Plz add mana or energy to her she is too op without it. Or make her q do less dmg or somthing like that.","replies":[{"poster":"DisasterSola","date":"2015-02-06T04:47:22.489+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Riven has sustain?

Bait the shield. Poke her down.\n\nRiven is squishy as fuck without the shield and has trash HP/reg stats. Once you got her below half health she will thin twice before going in. Before that, don't even try going for the kill. In early head on battles she has the upper hand. So why even try to play against her strenghts?! Play against her weaknesses instead, makes a lot more sense.\n\n2.) If she can't kill you with one skill rotation she's out of options. Solution to that: consider early tankyness. Don't think you can outdamage her early, most champs CAN'T, so don't bother. Focus on defense, farm and then watch Riven fall off because she can't get any kills. \n\n3.) Pick CC. Lissandra coutners her hard when used correctly.\n\n4.) Trick her into dashing into the wrong direction. Nothing fucks up a riven offense even more when almost all skills go into nowhere. Running away ina completly straight line won't do the trick here.\n\n5.) Most important rule: short before her reaching level 6 go back to shop. If you both stay in lane she just has more stats with the ult.","replies":[{"poster":"RuggedHunter","date":"2015-03-06T12:46:40.114+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Will you ever learn how to beat cho or yorick?

Riven has no sustain.  She has a shield that has a cooldown and that is it.  She's got some of the worst health regen stats in the game.\n\nSecond, early on Riven has the same cooldown problem everyone else has.  Yes, she'll stack CDR if she gets fed, but if you don't feed her she's living with her cooldowns are high enough to give you opportunities to attack her.\n\nThird, for an AD melee character Riven is squishy.  Most Riven's build her glass cannon and rely on her shield, life steal and the fact that people like you refuse to learn to play against her or to build any armor.\n\nSorry, but I don't main Riven and I know exactly how to defeat her.  I even ended up in an Annie v Riven midlane some time ago and beat her during laning phase.  (she fed later though.)  Beating Riven just requires that you know her moves and are willing to use minions to keep her from going all-in on you without burning her abilities.  If she has to use Q to get to you and burns 2 of the 3 to get to you, you have time to fight back.\n\nAlso purchase armor.  Armor is life against an AD bruiser.  If you aren't purchasing armor you deserve to die fighting a Riven.\n\nSorry, but this complaint is 100% based on you getting \"butthurt\" because you refuse to admit that you haven't taken the time to raise your own play to a reasonable level.  Riven is considered junk in the top tiers of the game because she can be shutdown so many ways.   Riot isn't going to nerf a champ who only dominates in the bronze/silver rankings because the players there refuse to learn how to counter a champion.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zazusha","date":"2015-03-06T12:49:41.279+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She's So Op.
