Or is it automatic?  Anyone know how to use this?","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-07-27T13:50:53.415+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"P2P isn't between your own computers, but downloading data from many users instead of directly from Riot's servers. It *may* be faster, but it might not be. You can enable it by clicking the gear icon on the top right of your launcher and selecting the checkbox.","replies":[{"poster":"PiedPorcupine","date":"2016-07-27T13:59:27.132+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh, I see.

It used to be part of an installation bundled with League of Legends a very long time go, and is no longer used.  The patcher now downloads any necessary files through our patching servers.  More information on this is also provided through the [announcement ](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/features/upcoming-pando-media-booster-removal)of its removal.  I hope that clears some things up!","replies":[{"poster":"PiedPorcupine","date":"2016-07-27T17:01:40.990+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok, thanks, it does!","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
