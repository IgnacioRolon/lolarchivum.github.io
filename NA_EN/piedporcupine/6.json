It also has a sad little poro lamenting with me.  My internet is fine, but while this error persists, I can't chat with anyone (obviously), and more importantly I can't invite them to games. What's the fix? Or what exactly is my problem?\n\nIt also prevents me from chatting in the pregame lobby.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-25T02:36:40.405+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dat poro was me being sad that you were having connection problems =(. \n\nYour own internet is most likely running pretty normally, so this might be more closely related to your network settings or how your ISP is routing your connection to our servers.

I have gone so far as to completely uninstall league and reinstall it.  I have flushed DNS, I have reset router (even though I am connected via ethernet, not wireless).  I have 100mpbs stable internet connection.  I have this issue and when I play a game, in champion select It says \"Connecting to chat\" but never does.  In the after match lobby it just says \"connecting\" but never does.  However, during a game I can chat just fine with everyone.  The big problem is not being able to see friend's list to invite or be invited to a game.  Makes playing the game rather boring if you can't play with friends.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PiedPorcupine","date":"2017-07-28T20:34:43.891+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yep, mine's having no problems anymore either.","replies":[]}]}
