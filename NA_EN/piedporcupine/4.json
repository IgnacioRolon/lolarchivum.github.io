This has been happening ever since {{champion:6}}  was released anew.   Worse, the game will sometimes even need to re-download.  Is there a fix for this, or is this just how the new client will behave from here on out?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-11T01:33:04.417+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The client definitely isn't meant to be re-downloading those patches every time, but it sounds like some of those patch files are somehow getting corrupted or damaged. That repatching is the client's way of trying to prevent you from crashing over and over again, which may very well happen if we don't get those files working properly again. \n\nIf those patches still aren't applying correctly, let's try a different approach.
