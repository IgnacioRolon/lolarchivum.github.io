When I am playing League, My ping will continually (but predictably) fluctuate between 30 to 1000, creating an uncontrollable lag.  I checked this problem with other online activities (namely Agar.io), and the same predictable lag spikes occurred there too.  This happened on my school WiFi, as well as my home WiFi.  When I connect to a wired connection, the problem disappears.  My brother who plays League at home played a game with me over WiFi, and he had no trouble while I continued to lag.\r\n\r\nSo I'm compelled to believe the problem is with my computer's ability to use a wireless connection, but I have no idea how to fix it.  If anyone has advice on how to solve this issue, please let me know!\r\n\r\nThanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-12-16T21:45:41.214+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Reading your description, I had a hunch that you might be playing on wi-fi.
