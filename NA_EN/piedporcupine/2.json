I usually have to try a couple times before it actually opens.\r\n2: When logging in, I will sometimes receive a message that I could not connect to the authentication service, and I will have to restart the client to login.\r\n3: After a match, my \"play\" button will go grey, claiming the game is patching.  If I wait, the grey-ness persists, and if I restart the client, the button will work again.\r\n\r\nAre these issues related and/or fixable? \r\n\r\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-08-18T18:50:14.251+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm here to lend a hand! \n\n1. This can happen if your security settings are blocking the patcher from launching.  The steps in the [permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) guide should help fix that.  A computer restart might help as well!\n2. This can happen if your connection is either unstable or also causing a block from accessing the authentication server.  The steps in the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide can resolve that.\n3. Same as number 2, some connection blocks seem to be getting in the way.  \n\nLet me know if you have any questions!","replies":[]}]}
