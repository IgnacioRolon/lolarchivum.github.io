I can see that you still have the right icon equipped so it should be showing up instead of the mastery one. \n\nI did notice also that one of the Arcade bundles ended a bit early and left the store today. I'm thinking the emote might have accidentally been disabled too early, but I'll have to reach out to a few people to know for sure.","replies":[{"poster":"Rajin Kajin ","date":"2017-08-27T20:41:53.637+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While we're here, if you could be so kind, my emotes aren't working properly.
