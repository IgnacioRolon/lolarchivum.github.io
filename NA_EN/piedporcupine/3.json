I don't have light speed internet or anything, but when I look at the patcher process in task manager, the computer claims that the patcher is using 1000 KBps worth of internet.  I don't know much  about how internet-related things function, so if there is anyone who does, could you tell me why I am patching so slowly?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-26T16:26:32.230+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It can take a few moments for your patcher to complete depending on the strength of your connection, rate of files being successfully downloaded and written, or other sources taking bandwidth.  As long as you're not receiving any errors or your download rate dropping to 0, I would recommend letting the patcher do its thing.  In the meantime, you can also check our[ connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to troubleshoot ways to strengthen your connection.
