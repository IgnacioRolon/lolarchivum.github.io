Everything is updated (drivers).\r\n\r\nRelevant info:\r\nWindows 10\r\n2 monitors (1080p and 4k)  - Running the game on 1080p one\r\n1080ti Driver version: 384.76\r\n\r\nThe only real thing i tried is restart the client but doesn't work. Clueless on what to try. I was thinking of trying with only 1 monitor plugged in, but I don't want to have to keep unplugging my monitor to play the game. So if it worked, it wouldn't matter.","replies":[{"poster":"30 Minutes Later","date":"2017-07-23T04:17:25.316+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is there any real help & support or is it seriously only this forum?\n\ne/ nvm I see the \"Submit a Ticket\" now.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-07-22T16:42:41.136+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This can happen if your connection fails to connect, so it places the game in a dormant state.
