In order to deviate from Worlds, I think this one should be 1820rp and the player could choose how they would like the skin; maybe having their names on it would be good: for example, Faker Leblanc as a skin if he got the Mvp.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Stags","date":"2019-04-18T18:00:58.900+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"This IS a cool idea Hero.
