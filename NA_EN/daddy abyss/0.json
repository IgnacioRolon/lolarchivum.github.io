Our Login server is not only responsible for ensuring that your Username and Password match, but also confirm the proper security certificates to your computer.  If your computer rejects the security certificates from our server, you will experience errors such as this.  These same errors will also occur if your connection is unstable or if you have security software that is blocking this connection ( either to the login servers or PvP.net).\n\nMake sure to try following the steps in this Knowledge Base Article, it should help in getting you into the client!\n\nhttps://support.leagueoflegends.com/entries/234161-Login-Issues\n\nIf you are still unable to sign-in and take to Rift with your friends, then don't give up!
