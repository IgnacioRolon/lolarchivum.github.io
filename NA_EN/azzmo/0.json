Since the waterskins in league are usually like Deep sea themed i decided to go with that and birthed this :D \nhttp://i.imgur.com/EKFGHb5.png\n\n**Description:**\nHe&#039;s more of an aquatic dragon with this skin with bio-luminescent spots like angler-fish (to mimic his stars in his original model). His gold crown is replaced with a black metallic headpiece and his jaws are more of a limestone coraline material. His flowing hair is now fins and he has webbed appendages.\n\n**Abilities:**\n**Passive:** the stars that orbit him are now glowing blue sea pearls with a water stream around them\n**Q:** is a whirl pool with a glowing center to mimic the newborn star\n**W:** the pearls and water streams dash around him instead of the stars, making more of a water splashing sound yet still maintaining the star explosions\n**E:** instead of flying in a stream of galactic clouds he flies (swims) in a stream of water, like his pearls\n**R:** instead of breathing star energy he could breathe a blast or water.\n\nHope u guys like it :D \nRiot please please please","replies":[{"poster":"BattleBalladeer","date":"2016-03-10T15:12:14.923+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"#You forgot to show us what his sunglasses would look like!\n\nThat's one of the most important parts of his kit!\n\nhttps://openclipart.org/image/2400px/svg_to_png/211108/dealwithit.png","replies":[{"poster":"Very Epic Guy","date":"2016-03-10T18:30:21.090+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Dragon270,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=E0crVUyz,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2016-03-10T15:12:14.923+0000)\n>\n> #You forgot to show us what his sunglasses would look like!\n> \n> That's one of the most important parts of his kit!\n> \n> https://openclipart.org/image/2400px/svg_to_png/211108/dealwithit.png\n\nI'd imagine they look like a snorkeling mask... thing","replies":[{"poster":"Evewynn","date":"2016-03-10T23:49:16.565+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Like...goggles?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Skylendor","date":"2016-03-10T18:38:37.195+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Galaxsea Aurelion Sol\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Evewynn","date":"2016-03-10T11:18:30.260+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even better than his release skin, love it!","replies":[{"poster":"Azzmo","date":"2016-03-10T16:38:36.662+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol thanks","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DragonShea","date":"2016-03-10T11:57:44.860+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is even before he is released.
