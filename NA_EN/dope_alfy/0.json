When kledd loses skaarl he can get him back from killing minnions, attacking a champion, or hitting a turret. The bug that i had severous times is that when i lose skaarl i begin to attack a hamp to outplay and get skaarl back buut the rage bar doesnt do anything. It stays at 0 and i get killed. so please riot fix this bug so we all can enjoy playing {{champion:240}} .","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Exgeniar","date":"2016-08-19T03:26:58.790+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is a 30 second cooldown between remount.

I do recognize his statistic performance but I think this is simply a factor of learning curve for the champ personally but the ease and speed he can remount is simply frustrating to play against to the point that riot simply cannot give him any buffs to up his statistic performance since he would become broken because of the extreme protection he gets from the dismount.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
