It is still pending. I added information to it on Thursday 10:28 AM (EDT) about more information regarding the issue and it is now Sunday 1:35 (EDT) and no one has gotten to my ticket at all. I am a bit deterred that the Riot Support Staff may have just glared over this ticket and ignored it, although it is a serious issue that happened to me and I need for it to be fixed immediately. Any riot employee that can read this post please have someone look into this ASAP. I am concerned for what happened and why it happened. I'm willing to speak to a staff member however possible.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-18T18:54:38.798+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We have no reason to ignore a ticket, and we want to help!
