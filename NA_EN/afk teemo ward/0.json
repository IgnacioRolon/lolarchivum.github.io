With a 4 year age difference, we never really matched up in interests, friends, or hobbies. Often times I would find myself playing games alone, with my brother dismissing me, and at times openly hostile towards my presence. My childhood was spent constantly fighting with him. We were always holding a grudge against each other, we each have a plethora of scars from the other, such was the degree that we fought.\n\nEventually, after years of trying to gain his approval and develop a good brotherly relationship I finally just gave up. As far as I was concerned, he was no brother to me, because all he ever did was exploit our relationship in a way that harmed me. That's when I found league of legends. In league, I found a game in which I built camaraderie with people from the internet, joined groups online, and had a blast. Yet still, I longed for a brother that would do more than tease, yell, and fight with me.\n\nFast Forward 2 years, and lo and behold, my brother has started playing, and came to me for tips on the game, how not to die, etc etc etc. Over the course of one month, we went from people that couldn't tolerate the sight of the other to two people who would always crack jokes together, enjoyed each other's presence, and, dare I say, acted as the brothers that I always wanted. So to Riot, I say thank you.\n\nTL:DR : League gave me my brother.","replies":[{"poster":"Zielmann","date":"2014-12-10T21:52:10.121+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":0,"body":"A strange obsession with Yordles and Poros.","replies":[{"poster":"awrsmth","date":"2014-12-11T00:37:29.105+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i havent done anything with poros cause i dont ever play ARAM but i am obsessed with the yordles too lol{{champion:74}} {{champion:17}} {{champion:68}} {{champion:117}} {{champion:18}} {{champion:42}} {{champion:115}} {{champion:32}} {{champion:150}} {{champion:85}} {{champion:78}} {{champion:45}}","replies":[{"poster":"Zielmann","date":"2014-12-11T00:41:45.904+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mostly play ARAM now, actually.

Except it didnt; off of the field i never even spoke with the other teammates, because we didnt have anything in common besides the sport. I hate watching the sports, i dont like the sports fans, I never understood the sports fanatics who knew all the teams and players and stats.

However the SC scene has always been rather small in the West, and also really Korean, and i never had anyone to share my passion for these competitive games with.\n\nEnter League Of Legends. \n\nI started LoL in.. Season 2? and as i learned the game, i became engrossed in the pro scene. I love Esports, so much. never before until LoL did i understand those sports fanatics that i used to disdain. But now, that hole where i always felt 'wrong' has been filled. i know the teams, the players, the stats. I follow the roster rumors and the controversies that come along with this amazing esports community. And since LoL is much bigger in the west that SC, i have finally found a group of others as passionate as me, that i can share my esports experiences with.

Growing up I was a competitive person from being bullied into thinking I wouldn't amount to anything , the adrenaline being in difficult situations, I could list a lot more. A little over 2 years ago a friend of mine introduced League to me as a means to get over an old MMO I played for years, since I had done nearly everything I had set my mind to in it. Back then League was this fun, overwhelming experience that I felt able to endlessly nurture my competitiveness, while not feeling like the race it was to *git gud* with MMOs. It was during this time that a handful of friends both from the internet and here at home would see or hear me playing and wanted to play together. For awhile it was fun, but I'm sure you can see where this is going.\n\nMonths pass, and the gap in learning curves were growing as well as a few egos. To shorten it up, from those months until earlier this year I became very tense and quick to judge the people who saw League a different way I did. I saw this game as a place to keep practicing and getting better, while just about everyone I know, save for a small handful, just wanted to play just to play. As a group we lost more than we won, and it began to bug me that it was harder to play with people who initially made me feel more comfortable than when I play solo, and I basically ruined this game for them. They saw playing solo as a less enjoyable experience, but relied on people like me to carry or be that leader no one else tried to be in our games. In the end I ended up burning a few bridges and ruining the fun this game brought them over trivial things I wish I was more understanding about. League is more of a game I play at my own leisure by myself or with a small group of friends, but it lost most of the fun I had with it. I'm by no means a great player, and I acknowledge as many mistakes as I can find so that I can keep improving. The best way I can sum up this whole chunk of text is to value your friends you get to share fun games and moments with, because you'll lose the people who just want to have fun with something that tension between those involved is common.\n\nI've spent the last few months with my online friends other playing games and genuinely having fun. Even though I still play League now and again, it doesn't overshadow the things that matter to my friends. So I suppose it's a good ending, but I have things to learn about splitting my personal agenda with what others care about.\n\n**tl;dr **\n\n I like competitive games. Played League with a large group of good friends. Ruined friendships and discouraged others from playing. *All the regret.* Please don't be an ass to your friends over trivial garbage. Currently making up for what I threw away playing League.","replies":[]}]}
