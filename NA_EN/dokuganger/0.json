Has anyone else been experiencing a similar problem where their champion&#039;s voices are completely muted? (I have the voice bar turned up to max in settings). I use Mac btw.\r\n\r\nThanks :)","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-02-16T17:10:49.331+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey! \n\nI haven't seen other reports of this personally. Have you tried doing a client repair? We patch pretty often, and it's possible some files got jumbled along the way. Lemme know if that works, and if not, I can poke around and see what some other options are.","replies":[{"poster":"Dokuganger","date":"2016-02-17T00:07:55.214+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey!
