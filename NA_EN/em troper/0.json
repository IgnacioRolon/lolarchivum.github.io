People like you keep trying to connect wanting to surrender with the prediction of winning or losing. I thought I made it clear but apparently you still don't get it. I do not surrender because I think we are going to lose. I surrender because the game has become toxic and unfun. That has nothing to do with winning or losing.","replies":[{"poster":"CrazyBear1987","date":"2016-11-09T02:47:08.189+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You have to understand as well your statement is hypocritical, you only play when \"it's fun and non toxic\"\n\nbe real, this is league only the game when your team is absolutely winning is it \"fun and non-toxic\"\n\nno one play's for \"fun\", there is always a goal, more IP, new champion, climb ranks.\n\nYour just salty you were losing and still losing, making it as you say \"unfun and toxic\"\n\nGrow up dude and just play, your not going to get anywhere throwing tantrums.\n\nStop blaming the 2 \"trolls\" and others. \"Fix the surrender vote\" No. \n\n{{sticker:zombie-nunu-bummed}}","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Narvuntien","date":"2016-11-08T04:19:10.080+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you are in ranked, there is no reason to surrender, you are going from probable loss to a definate loss.

Its a game you should be having fun that is how it works. Clearly 2 people were still having fun. They aren't arse holes for that, they are still enjoying the game.\n\nGot to learn to enjoy the game for the games sake and not only when you are winning, if its not fun unless you win perhaps try a different game, there is a lot of games you can win.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-11-08T04:07:21.561+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nope.
