Initially, we created one True Damage border that applied to the whole set, but once the border hit PBE, we saw some solid feedback that having one color across the board didn’t fit as well as individual border treatments. We agree, so we’ll be updating the borders with unique colors for each skin. \r\n\r\nhttps://i.imgur.com/0863Cez.png\r\n\r\n_[Updated Borders]_\r\n\r\nBecause these changes are coming in late, you won't see them when the skins and borders are first released during the current patch (9.22) on November 10, 2019. Depending on when you unlock them, you may see the blue border first, but rest assured, **we'll be swapping it for the new design no later than patch 9.24** in early December.\r\n\r\nSince we won't be able to get the borders updated in time for launch on the 10th, we know some players will pick up the all-blue border sets without having seen this post. So, when we make the swap to unique border colors, there'll be a short period where anyone who doesn't like the change can submit a Player Support ticket to have their purchase refunded without using a refund token. **We'll share the dates of this refund period once we've locked down the date for the border swap.**\r\n\r\nThanks to all of you who shared your thoughts! We’re so excited for the launch of True Damage and appreciate all the feedback. \r\n\r\nRiot Eggo McLego\r\n\r\n{{sticker:poppy-wink}}","replies":[{"poster":"Athenais01","date":"2019-11-08T22:51:47.675+0000","up_votes":40,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please change Prestige Qiyana's border since this time it's a special collaboration with LV.

I haven't logged in since 19th of October, I had zero interest in the Championship and High Noon Border skins and Chromas hence why I decided to save my money and come back on the 10th of November. I even double-checked online and many others (not everyone) were having the same issue of not being notified in advance the same way as the Demacia Vice skin lineup and the recent High Noon lineup. Is there any way you can extend only the true damage event? If not I would have to grind 3200+ tokens for all the chromas and Qyianna skin, thats 214 tokens per day, 14 wins (about 30 games with my 50% w/r) every day for 15 days which is roughly ~450 games in less than 2 weeks and that's just for chromas and LV Presitage skin alone &amp; not taking into account for the other stuff.
