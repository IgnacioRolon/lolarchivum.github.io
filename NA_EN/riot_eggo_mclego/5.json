We’ve fixed the texture in patch 9.23 to cover more of his head without altering his overall look very much. Again, this is already live, but wanted to make sure that everyone who chimed in about this was aware of the change!\r\n\r\nhttps://i.imgur.com/Zd5kOQm.gif\r\n\r\nSecondly, seven of True Damage Ekko's chromas went live in patch 9.23, but we have one more coming in patch 9.24. Due to some adjustments we wanted to make to that eighth chroma (‘Obsidian True Damage Ekko’), it was not included in time to be a part of the bundle. The pricing on the bundle correctly reflected the seven chromas, so those who bought it were not overcharged for eight. But with that said, the Obsidian TD Ekko chroma will not ever be a part of the chroma bundle, and will only be available for purchase individually. \r\n\r\nThanks again for sharing your thoughts and for your time!\r\nRiot Eggo McLego\r\n\r\n{{sticker:vlad-salute}}","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2019-11-21T21:53:22.814+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot Eggo McLego,realm=NA,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=UaPEcgvX,comment-id=,timestamp=2019-11-21T21:51:35.819+0000)Greetings fellow humans.\n\nYOU DON'T KNOW ME!\n\n...\n\nAnyway, thanks for the update, and for the hair tweak! Looks much better with the texture tweak, and I'm glad you guys found a way to resolve those concerns that didn't require model or animation changes. I was already happy with the skin, and now I'm happier. :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"nomeL","date":"2019-11-21T22:02:22.436+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is nice.

True damage Ekko looks so neat with the hood on, great design, as displayed in his recall/homeguard animation. It would be very cool if it could be toggled on, a feature I would certainly use in many of my games.\n\nI am guessing that many players of Ekko would really appreciate this change! :)\n\nHave a great day, and the new chroma looks sick! {{champion:245}} \nThanks\nBR\nFelix","replies":[]},{"poster":"LEMMiNO","date":"2019-11-24T17:25:44.728+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm hoping (the same as kai'sa) when you click ctrl-5 we can put the hoodie on.
