I've been waiting for emotes to come out for a while. And while I was waiting, I've made 45 different fan made emotes. Hope you guys like em'. I usually stream myself drawing these at twitch.tv/notsungben. If this post gets a good reception, I guess I'll try to stream myself making one emote for every champion again (which was my original goal).\n\nhttps://sungben.deviantart.com/art/Twitch-tv-request-No-6-Bard-thinking-emote-703823400\nIt's just Bard thinking.

There seems to be a lot of \"i want free shit\" mentality around here and Riot is adding a lot of free cosmetics you don't have to pay for, in each season so far. It really pisses me off when this isn't enough and people actually think they're entitled to more.\n\nIf you're unhappy with how much free stuff you're getting, find me a game that gives you more and that's at least equal or better than LoL. Then we can talk about the systems and compare what is being done right or wrong. Otherwise, this is just one more useless complaint on a pile of feedback people don't know how to properly give.\n----\nThe only useful feedback i see here is not that there's a lack of quality in emotes, it's the price.     So Riot could potentially do the same thing they did for Chromas, to make emotes available for IP sales after 6 months of their release and can hold these twice a year. But since Riot also said that they'll put emotes as loot in Hextech Crafting somehow, Chromas aren't in the Hextech Loot table. It stands to reason to hold IP sales got chromas (and not having to buy them for RP but have to wait for the IP sale) whereas it wouldn't be reasonable to make emotes available for IP and then put them in Hextech Crafting, essentially devaluing their RP cost.","replies":[]},{"poster":"A Nunu","date":"2017-10-12T00:26:26.082+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Haha.
