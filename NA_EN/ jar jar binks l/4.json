From the [patch notes](https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-91-notes):\n\n> Tumble's cooldown is reduced by 50% while Final Hour is active _(reminder: Tumble's cooldown doesn't start until Vayne fires the empowered attack)_\n\nSo, if Vayne for some reason has 40% CDR (which she won't unless she's itemizing for cheese hilarity rather than DPS), a max-rank Tumble would have a 1.2-second CD. When she hits Final Hour, it goes down to 0.6 seconds. When she Tumbles, the ability's CD does not immediately start, nor does it start when she fires an auto. It starts when the projectile hits a target. ER refunds 20% of the _remaining_ CD (not that that distinction matters when the ability's CD only started when the auto hit, anyway), in this case refunding 20% of 0.6 seconds, which is 0.12 seconds, for a remaining CD of 0.48 seconds. If her only CDR is from ER, Tumble's CD would be 1.6 seconds, or 0.8 during Final Hour, which would be reduced to 0.64 seconds by ER when the attack hits.

She is so easy to counter. All you have to do is punish her in laning phase. This buff doesn't make her that much more powerful. Just know what to do in a fight. There are so many champs with CC enough to stop her. You save that cc for her, wait for the moment she briefly stops to fire an AA (she'd want to be firing at least 2 every time she's out of stealth, considering her Rageblade is stacked) and boom, you got her. Since she is not 4k HP heavy bruiser, 1 CC lands and the party is over. I don't see a problem.
