You spent the vast majority of the match flaming and harassing your ADC, arguing about pointless nonsense, and so on.\n\n> ...in fact, IM the one who got flammed and trolled and harrassed all game because of the champ i picked...\n\nThat doesn't exempt you from the rules. You were no better than the person who flamed you, because _you flamed them right back._\n\n> ...invalid reports or even reports that were made because someone baited (Even if u didnt say or do anything for a validated report) should be able to be challenged and looked into further in cases like this.\n\nWell, that proposal presents a pretty big problem, because..._**Who's the judge as to what's valid or not?**_ The punished player can't be considered a valid judge, because they're innately biased. No matter what, the punished player will always want to challenge their punishment, because they don't want to be punished.\n\nYour punishment was valid. You flamed and harassed your ADC since the start of the game clear up 'til the end of it, and it doesn't matter _who_ started it. You participated, and you did so eagerly.\n\n> i literally got punished for playing nasus support and doing well with it...\n\nClearly, you didn't, because if you were punished for playing Nasus Support (which would be considered a gameplay offense, hypothetically speaking), **_you would not have been given chat logs._** You'd have been given a link to your match history to indicate that you trolled/intentionally fed.\n\nThe fact that you _got_ chat logs is an indication that you were punished not for what you played, but for what you said in the chat.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2019-12-20T23:20:50.692+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unjustified reports already thrown out. \n\nWhat you are going through is what we call the \"you were at fault but you don't see it\" syndrome.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-12-20T21:14:32.871+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So, it has come to this: someone displayed misbehavior in a LoL match in flagrant disregard for the game's rules, ToS, EULA, and Summoner's Code. That's unfortunate, and I'm sorry you had to deal with it. If this misbehavior happened in chat (including emotes or ping) and they don't respond positively to a _single, courteous, constructive request to focus on the game_, your best option is to mute that player. Submit a report after the match. This is equivalent to dealing with a noisy person in a library by asking them to keep it down and then notifying library staff and moving to another area.\n\n_Do not respond with misbehavior of your own!_ If you do that, your teammates may report _you_, and those reports would be valid. This is equivalent to dealing with a noisy person in a library by getting into a shouting match with them. Just because someone else started it doesn't justify you in continuing it. I'm sure you're familiar with the \"s/he started it\" trope, where two children get into an argument or fight and then try to claim innocence of any wrongdoing by claiming that they didn't instigate it. As any parent, teacher, or other supervisor of children will tell you, that excuse doesn't fly. When Dad is trying to drive you to Disneyland and your annoying brother starts making faces at you as he's previously been told not to, you should calmly ask him to stop, and then, if that doesn't work, calmly notify your parents of the problem. Making faces at him or shouting at him has never been a good way to get him to stop, and it makes you just as guilty of that as he.\n\nRiot doesn't care who started it. Someone else's misbehavior does not justify your own.\n\nFrom [Riot's support knowledgebase](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207489286-Instant-Feedback-System-FAQ-):\n\n> * Simply speaking, retaliation is not an acceptable or justifiable behavior. An argument between two players can easily create a negative experience for the rest of the players in the game with you. Regardless of the other player’s actions, this does not justify your own behavior. You alone are responsible for your actions within the game.If you encounter a toxic player like this, the best option is to simply report their behavior and move on.\n> * Reports are a vital piece to the puzzle. If you are not sure of what sort of behavior is reportable take a look at the [Reporting a Player FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752884-Reporting-a-Player)\n\nThe only chat messages included in your chat log are your own for a single, extremely good reason: they are the only ones taken into account for your punishment, because they're the only ones in your control. The things other players said and did in your match might produce in you an impulse to do certain things that may include breaking LoL's rules, but your behavior is your own, and you are responsible for it. If you really think about it, this is a good thing. If a toxic player's goading could exempt you from punishment for your flaming them, calling for reports, etc., then it would logically go the other way as well, resulting in punishments for players who didn't necessarily break any rules but weren't quite as friendly and positive as their teammates. Can you imagine a world where \"didn't participate in the dance party and ignored all of our jokes\" was a valid report that could get someone suspended for two weeks? We don't want that situation anymore than we want \"called our support a braindead waste of space\" to be considered an _invalid_ report just because, say, the support was telling their team to harm themselves while they merrily ran it down mid.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wffej","date":"2019-12-20T21:11:59.773+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":8,"body":"See, this is my point. nothing is taken into account or context. **You spent a significant amount of your chat harassing and insulting a teammate.** No, in fact, i got harrassed and flammed from the get go, i simply replied. **Very early on you're harassing a player for having AFK'ed and come back** Also no, as stated previously, soon as he got in lane he started flaming me.
