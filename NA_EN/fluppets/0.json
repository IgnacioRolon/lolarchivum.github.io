It is really hard if not impossible to make items that benefit Fighters but ADC&#039;s cant (ab)use better or vice-versa. \n\nI have an idea, but it is quite radical and requires a complete item and maybe even kit/balance overhaul. However I think it has alot of benefits.\n\n**Remove Critical Strike Chance for Ranged Attacks.**\n\n* Gives Melee fighters a distinct characteristic: If they get close they have a chance to deal extra damage (with less AD investment + high risk/reward).\n* Emphasises Ranged Marksmen&#039;s characteristic of dealing sustained, constant and reliable damage. (opposed to RNG/Bursty).\n* Removes alot of the problems with crossover itemization and abuse cases.\n\nThis will allow fighters to make item choices balancing damage (prioritising ARpen + Crit chance) with tank + chase items so they can get to melee range, deal their damage, apply their CC and ARpen.\n\nRather than focusing how Fighters get close and stick to a target (  ),\nI would focus on how they get rewarded for getting close and how it compares to champions that dont need to get close (ie: ADC's).\n\nFighters would be able to get a crit item for their (RNG) damage, get some tank + sticky items and Armor shred. In turn Armor shred should be more expensive for ADC's, thus requiring Fighters in the late game to provide Armor shred and peel power for the ADC's while not making their damage obsolete. In return ADC's should get better scaling due to the removal of Crit chance.\n\nWith {{champion:157}}  and the {{champion:22}} rework, you can already see Riot testing this direction.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2015-07-28T09:19:56.277+0000","up_votes":30,"down_votes":3,"body":"We're on the same page when it comes to fighters and ADC item overlap, which makes it difficult to offer effects that are an appropriate fit for one class, but not the other.

This would further emphasize (for example) Caitlyns (unique) ability to critically strike from ranged with her passive because she excells at sniping/high precision shots.\n\nI could really see Jax's crit animation swinging upwards between the legs... you know, uhh... hitting those \"tender spots\". :)\n\n> * Help melee champions engage in a fight, or stick to targets better once in a fight, in ways that aren't as consistently useful or accessible on ranged champions (Randuin's and Phage are good examples of this category) .\n> \n\nSee this is mainly what I am concerned about: many fighters already have some ways of getting close to a target and then staying there. By giving these champions too many options in the sticky department you risk making them very frustrating and overbearing. \n\nWhat I think would happen with crit being exclusive to melee is rather than strengthening/emphasizing their sticking potential is rewarding them with damage from crit chance for succeeding in getting to/sticking to a target. There's a high risk involved in getting to melee range and it would only be appropriate there's a high reward. \n\nWhile ranged auto attack damage should not be subject to RNG/burst effects rather be constant with a predictable scaling.\n\n> We're currently working on some items using the above approaches, which are intended in part to be good fits on heavy, immobile fighters like Garen, Darius, Udyr etc. More details to follow sometime pretty soon (patch 5.16 or 5.17 at a guess, so potentially hitting PBE 1-3 weeks from now, depending on how the rest of the work goes).\n\nI really think removing critical chance from ranged attacks will truly open up the playing field, right now it narrows the playing field for both ADC's and fighters. **I really think it's something you should just consider and play around with**, if only for the change in perspective, maybe you'll drop the idea itself but other interesting ideas might pop up.\n\nthanks for the interesting reply.","replies":[{"poster":"SlashXVI","date":"2015-07-28T22:17:09.152+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Fluppets,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=6inoy4d3,comment-id=00020002,timestamp=2015-07-28T09:45:39.421+0000)\n>\n> Other than late game scaling (which could be achieved in a different way once you remove ranged crit chance) I dont see what crit chance offers. \n\nIf you have ever tried to take down any remotely tanky char without an adc without itemizing into crit, you will know how important that stat is in those cases.

The exceptions: Ezreal, Miss Fortune, Kalista, Vayne are actually some of my favorite ADCs because of their ability to build differently and still do well. \nWhile I do think critical chance should be a rewarding way to build a marksman, it should not allow a marksman to outburst a mage or an assassin. This is one of the biggest problems playing assassins right now. Late game, if an assassin fails to reach the ADC or if a mage misses so much as a single ability, they pretty much lose that fight. There's no recovery, and screwing up is extremely brutal and unforgiving. A fight should not be about who hits first, it should be about who is more skilled at kiting and utilizing their kit to their advantage. Granted, by all means let that ADC take advantage of their range when an enemy screws up... but don't give them kill potential within 3-4 auto attacks. That's not alright. What has this lead to? Marksman who do build differently due to their kit having an extremely hard time keeping up in damage, and likewise, making it hard to succeed in lane. In addition to this, it has also pretty much set in stone a build path if you want to be guaranteed good, solid damage. In conclusion, it leaves the role feeling dry and repetitive. While kit certainly does play a huge amount into gameplay, most ADCs have some kind of dash, and an attack speed / damage steroid. This is why things like Kalista's Rend and Miss Fortune's scaling make them fun to play.

With that, it allows tuning the item for a specific purpose: To be either a late-game purchase without additional health or to be something you'd ideally buy on top of already having some extra HP.\nEssentially, it would keep an item which base concept is rather strong (AD/Armor combination) from being abused in a lane scenario, by putting the point of maximum power farther back.","replies":[{"poster":"Champion Skin","date":"2015-08-06T10:33:08.884+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well there is already a cap not like you can get infinite HP(Unless you are Sion) and you likely do want and need to build some resistances to make better use of all of that HP\nAnd if you had the HP to AD ratio stay at 1.5% and you cap it at 30 AD... a lot of champions would pretty much cap it without building any HP\nAs base HP at level 18 ranges from 1645 to 2347 and it would cap at 2000 hp (so basically it's kind of an item which scales with level? which you can speed up by buying HP of course the cap stays the same)\n\nhttp://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/List_of_champions'_health","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Apulminate","date":"2015-07-29T20:11:00.106+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I personally see little to no itemization overlap with fighters and ADC's. I think something to keep in mind when thinking about itemization ideas for AD fighters is that there is a great level of disparity between AD and AP itemization. Itemization choices for AP fighters is far superior than what is currently available to AD fighters. AD fighters typically have to dedicate a certain number of slots to offensive stats and the remainder is left to defensive items, AP fighters however don't really face this same kind of dilemma as they can easily pick up every defensive stat needed and have 4-5 items that provide ability power. AP champs simply have easier access to defensive stats. There has been mention of Atma's on here, which is an item that if reintroduced would be able to put fighters in a better place, perhaps removing the crit chance and replacing it with 20 flat pen would have a significant impact.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2015-07-29T19:35:33.845+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Help melee champions engage in a fight, or stick to targets better once in a fight, in ways that aren't as consistently useful or accessible on ranged champions (Randuin's and Phage are good examples of this category) .\n\nYou mean like giving thornmail +40 armor vs crits?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Khristophoros","date":"2015-07-28T21:50:55.977+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=6inoy4d3,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-07-28T09:19:56.277+0000)\n>\n> We're on the same page when it comes to fighters and ADC item overlap, which makes it difficult to offer effects that are an appropriate fit for one class, but not the other.

But at the same time... The calculation that determines damage dealt is in favour of offense not defense. Not to mention the variety AD carries have: Crit Chance and Damage, Flat Armor Pen, %Armor Pen, %health damage, True Damage, Attack Speed and last but not least Lifesteal.\n\n**For example: Playing as {{champion:133}} all I need to buy is {{item:3031}}, {{item:3006}} and a {{item:3072}} before I go on a rampage!

Not even having a decent rune page**\n\nFew Bruisers and Tanks have the utility to diminish or nullify one of the followings all most of us have is Health/Armor and Magic Resist, with the few %damage reductions and attack speed slow's we have.
