What I suggest: \n\n **Twin Fangs refunds its mana cost if the minion dies while the projectile is mid-air** (but no bonus mana and still goes on Cooldown).\n\n\n* While her role is to do sustained damage in teamfights (like an ADC) she cannot maintain her dps in a prolonged teamfight, because her high mana cost on Twin Fang is balanced around refunding on Minion Executes. What I suggest:\n\n **Twin Fang Executes on Champions and Big jungle monsters doubles the mana refund.** (2 * mana cost + 3% maximum mana).\n\n\n* Poison indicator visual update (not really balance IK). This has been promised a long time ago, it's a long-time-coming. \n\n **Get on with it!**\n\nThese aren&#039;t big changes, but they will noticeably increase the Quality of Life for Cassiopeia players and remove some of the frustrating and counter-intuitive parts about her Poison - Twin Fang mechanics/play pattern.\n\nhttp://media.lolusercontent.com/api/embedly/1/image/resize?url=http%3A%2F%2Fddragon.leagueoflegends.com%2Fcdn%2F5.14.1%2Fimg%2Fchampion%2FCassiopeia.png&key=f0abbd34f14549f3a15cd94dd9970851&width=100&height=100&errorUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.leagueoflegends.com%2Fapollo%2Fassets%2Fblank.png","replies":[{"poster":"Leu07","date":"2015-07-28T21:45:27.079+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"They shouldn0t have nerfed her E mana sustain by half (3%-1.5%), maybe 2% would be fair, and the spell vamp E nerf was totally unnecessary.","replies":[]},{"poster":"1000angrybees","date":"2015-07-28T19:18:21.977+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not sure those are specifically QoL as much as they are small buffs or mechanical fixes. QoL leans more toward clarity, like changing MF's E (Make It Rain) ground indicator to be more noticeable and stand out against the background. Though I won't disagree that these would be helpful for her.","replies":[{"poster":"Fluppets","date":"2015-07-28T20:38:47.415+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I guess you're right, a better word would be fixes, because the way I see it its like the designers \"forgot\" to implement these features.
