The only fix I was ever able to find was to reinstall league, which works, but then as soon as another update comes out, I have to repeat the process. This has been about the 6th time this has happened to me now, and I'm getting fed up with having to reinstall the game so many times. Is there any possible way to fix this?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-10T22:33:40.243+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can imagine that would get pretty frustrating heckin' fast even for myself =(. If you're running on wifi, it might be some slight hiccup in your network where some of those patch files were missed or damaged in the download. Try using an ethernet connection for patches if possible, or at the very least try updating some of your network settings using the DNS and port forwarding steps in the [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues).","replies":[{"poster":"Valendin","date":"2018-01-11T00:55:40.663+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok, thank you for the quick response and suggestions","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"HÎ¼ghes","date":"2018-01-10T22:29:46.514+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"let the update finish, it will take much less time as you would think. \nfor me it always shows every patch is like 2gb up to 4.4GB but it actually finished downloading and such in like 20min with 200kb/sec\n\nlike now while i write this it downloaded 500mb with 200kb/sec in 2min","replies":[]}]}
