How do you know it's false? Has there been a statement from Riot?\n\n Well, the phrases are labeled as \"zero-tolerance phrases.\" [Here's Riot Tantram using the phrase himself. ](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/OeZ3ipZB-got-a-14-day-suspension-by-a-teammate-on-purpose?show=flat&amp;page=2) The name alone suggests you can't ever use them. \n\n In addition to that, the Riot support website's FAQ on the [Instant Feedback System](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207489286) specifically states:\n\n>##WHY DID I SKIP RESTRICTIONS?\n\n>\"We have a zero-tolerance policy for extreme negative behavior as well as extremely offensive language and remarks made in game towards other players. Since it is a severe disregard for the Summoner’s Code this sort of behavior can result in skipping to a Two week or Permanent suspension. Suspensions of this degree based on negative behavior will not likely be reduced or removed.\"\n\n Which again displays Riot's use of the phrase \"zero-tolerance\" and \"extremely offensive language\" would encompass things like racism, homophobia, or inciting self-harm. \n\n Finally, the only \"evidence\" some people have (if you can even call it that) is anecdotal. They have a few links to cases where people weren't given proper punishments for the language that was used. This is incorrect and irrelevant for three reasons:\n\n_______\n\n1 - As I understand it (I could be wrong) the IFS doesn't punish for rulebreaking behavior that hasn't been reported. Simply put if you report a player only for standard negative behavior, it won't give them the correct punishment if they were to use hate speech. So rather than receiving a 14-day ban, they receive a 10-game chat restriction instead. \n\nLike I said this could be wrong, it just seems to be the case sometimes. \n\n_________\n\n2 - Logically, it doesn't make sense for Riot to allow these phrases and punish them inconsistently. Why do some people get 14-day bans (correct punishment for zero tolerance language) when others only receive 10-game chat restrictions? Errors can occur, punishments can take time to be doled out, and in rare cases a manual review is needed. \n\n________\n\n3 - As mentioned above, the people supporting ZT language can only provide _anecdotal_ evidence.\n\n I've been using the Boards a _lot_ longer than most and I can tell you with certainty that 95%+ of cases where zero-tolerance phrases have been used were dealt with correctly. The 5% of other cases were missed or handled incorrectly due to reasons 1 and 2.\n\n But of course, those 5% of cases are enough for some people to form incorrect bases for reasoning.
