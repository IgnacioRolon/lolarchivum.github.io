I have Cox High Speed and I had them come to my house to make sure nothing had slowed down. My internet is just fine. I can assure this with the multiple speed tools I have been using. My latency for practically any game or speed test is between 11ms and 77ms. In all my games (including League) I ping 77. Unfortunately, in my recent past I jump all over the place. Currently I am between 300 and 400. Some of my games earlier today start at 200 and then reduce to a constant 77 for the end of game. Yet every game restarts the ping atrocity. Is there a driver that is defective or something? My internet is fine I promise.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-29T22:21:49.663+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you might have some solid internet, but issues specifically holding a strong connection to the game server.   This could be an issue with how your ISp is routing to the server, or a local issue.
