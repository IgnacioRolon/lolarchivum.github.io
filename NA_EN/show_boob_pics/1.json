Using \"gay\" as a negative meaning word back then, whether or not the person thought about what they were saying, was a sign of how deeply ingrained it was in society that being gay was something to be ashamed of.\n\nTo the point where a term that refers to homosexuals was used as a common insult or expletive.","replies":[{"poster":"TrulyBland","date":"2020-01-24T12:40:37.390+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">Using \"gay\" as a negative meaning word back then [...] was a sign of how deeply ingrained it was in society that being gay was something to be ashamed of.\n\nCouldn't agree more.\n\nThere's a reason why there's a whole bunch of insults based on homosexuality, that even tend to be directly translatable into other languages, with both the same severity of the insult and the same meaning in regards to homosexuality.\n\nBeing in denial about that reason may be relatable to some extent, but it's just that: Denial.\n\nI still cringe at how I'd use those terms in front of one of my best friends, who is gay.

It's neither positive nor negative.\nB) Talking about a straight path is in no way a reference to heterosexuals.\n\nSmall sidenote here is that it's actually the other way around: Heterosexuals being called \"straight\" is actually yet another sign of… well… not necessarily intolerance towards homosexuality, but definitely a sign of heteronormativity.\n\nAnyway, the point is exactly **why** it was used in the 2000's as a synonym for stupid/lame/etc. It's not about the strict meaning of the word, but the way this meaning came about. It's about how this became a cultural meme.\nAnd the simple and straight forward answer to that is simply that homosexuality at that time was itself still widely regarded as something inherently negative.\n\nAs for \"we have the right to the word, too\" and \"you can't let them claim it without a fight\": There's nothing wrong with reclaiming a word… but the whole idea of reclaiming words is to void them of their negative connotation.\n\nUsing gay to neutrally refer to homosexuals does that. Likewise it's reclaiming when homosexuals call each other \"f%%%%ts\" and the likes. For what it's worth, if you want to use it in its original meaning to refer to something joyful I would also regard that as a way to reclaim the word.\n\nWhat absolutely **doesn't** reclaim the word is deliberately continuing to use the words with a negative connotation. If you retain its negative meaning, then you are also retaining the cultural meme that created it: The idea that homosexuality is bad.\n\nThat's why it's insensitive to use those words this way.\nTo be clear: Not homophobic. Just insensitive.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Weiss Guertena","date":"2020-01-22T16:16:05.307+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Automated system doesn't know context tho.
