I mean this is the first game I ever played continually and never quit but come on for such a good game the rewards are actually insanely bad. I like the new missions they have been adding so I can buy key fragments for all the chests I receive, The thing with this is that everytime I get idk 45 snow down tokens or whatever which costs 3 key fragments I get a crap skin shard that no one wants or an OK skin shard for a champ I don&#039;t even play. So I usually stock up 3 skins that I never want and reroll and then the reroll is a 520 RP skin or something. I've gotten 11 total skins of rerolls that are lower than 950 RP. The last 1350 skin I got was Battlecast Kog&#039;maw. If you play at least 3-4 games everyday  (without special missions) you should get 3 key fragments in 1 week. and that one chest that took a week to get could be a skin shard, ward skin, champion shard, and summoner icon. So you might not even get a skin shard. The point is it takes at least 3 weeks to get 3 skin shards (minimum time if your chests are all skin shards). So I have opened 33 chests which took basically 33 weeks (probably longer but just hypothetically speaking)  and got no skin shards higher than 950, and then rerolled 11 times and still no skins higher than 950. Maybe this is just my garbage luck but this seems like crap. \n\nI know I used to play Fortnite for a bit when my friend wanted me to try it and it was an ok game but the loot system was amazing that&#039;s part of the reason they have so many players. Legit 10 BUCKS for 100 things of loot and like 5 skins including. Also, you can save up and get the next 100 things for free, which every season is like 3 months so basically 400 items in 1 year for 10 bucks if your smart and save which is like 20 good skins for 10 bucks. Even Overwatch gives you a loot box every level up and a loot box for playing the side games. Like I believe that League of Legends has the best cosmetic team than every other game but pls why even introduce the loot system if it&#039;s a huge waste of time.","replies":[]}
