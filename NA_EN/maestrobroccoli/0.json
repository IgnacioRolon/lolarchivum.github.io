I've tried restarting my router, switching my dns to google's and using ipconfig /flushdns in my command prompt and restarting my computer.  When I check my ping on speedtest.net it says I have 10ms and my download and upload speeds are regular, so as far as I know this is only for league.  Any ideas?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-13T21:29:31.078+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for running those tests, it does seem like either a local setting or ISP routing might be causing this.  Download [WinMTR](http://winmtr.net/winmtr-v0-92-now-available/) and use it to run a traceroute to 104.160.131.1 for about 5 minutes.  Remove the first 2 rows of IPs only, and let me know what you find.","replies":[{"poster":"MaestroBroccoli","date":"2017-10-16T19:11:15.877+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It ending up fixing itself, I decided to just give it a day and it went back to normal.  I had 2 other friends with the same problem, with the exact same ping at the same time, so maybe it was something up with league itself or it was in our area.  But thanks for the help anyways!","replies":[]}]}]}
