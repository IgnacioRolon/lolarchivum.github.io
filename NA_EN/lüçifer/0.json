There are usually two reasons for that; either your connection is having trouble, or your computer is having trouble processing a lot of things in the client at once (like animations, for example). The first step I'd like you to try is opening settings and enabling 'Low Specs Mode' to see if that helps with the speeds. If it doesn't, you should also try troubleshooting connection with [**this guide**](http://riot.com/12B7oac) over here. Following those steps will ensure that your connection speeds are up to par. \n\nIf neither of those help out though, get back to me and I can see if there are other things to try, or I can get you some more in depth help in a ticket. :)","replies":[]}]}
