In the last week, every time I load into a game my client will be in 1024x768 Windowed mode on Very Low Graphics. (I have a super PC and can run everything at Max and have been doing so for years). \r\n\r\nI change the settings and it takes a few seconds and then the game is playable. This has become incredibly annoying to do every game, especially if I want to get out of spawn early to invade or watch for an invade.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I have tried:\r\n- changing settings and restarting the client\r\n- going into a custom to change settings and restarting the client\r\n- uninstalling League entirely (guessing I missed a setting file somewhere)\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease help!","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-13T02:21:03.787+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your in-game settings are tied to a file that is saved server-side. It's possible that if we complete a reset of that file, it could resolve this issue. I recommend following the steps below:\n\nFirst, **log into League** then navigate to your install directory:\n\n> **C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config**\n\nDelete the folder called **CONFIG**\n\nOnce you've deleted this folder, close League out, then log back into League. Create a custom match and confirm that everything has been reset to default and that you load in as expected. If this worked, be sure to make any hotkey and game/sound settings you normally play with, as this reset also set every setting back to default. Let me know if this worked!","replies":[{"poster":"Ghostedly","date":"2017-03-16T11:47:43.099+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This worked for me, thank you so much!!","replies":[]}]}]}
