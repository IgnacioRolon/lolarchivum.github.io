However, on daily basis, the connection speed is pretty decent, or at least, still makes the games playable. Usually, my ping range from 200 to 500 and that's pretty average for me. Little lag here and there, but never been really bad. \n\nHOWEVER each every split fragments of a second, in every few minutes, the ping will go as far as 1200 to 1600 or _**EVEN MORE**_. \n\nThis is because my average connection speed are somewhere around 50 to 65 mbps which is average. However, when the connection get really bad, it will plummet to 1 mbps for few seconds, and this is a constant reoccurring issues. And there's no way to fix this. Indonesian internet sucks. {{sticker:sg-ahri-1}} \n\nAnother factor that cause the lag spikes is probably distance. People saying that if you play nearby the server, even shit-tier internet will be sufficient to play the league. And obviously, the further your distance, the worse it will be. So.... if people says that playing on Canada already makes your lag goes bad, then what happened if you play on Europe? Middle East? Africa? Southeast Asia? And such? \n\nI live in Indonesia. And yes we DO had LoL server for ASEAN called Garena, but playing there would require me moving my account from the NA, and I'm not capable of that. (Plus, Indonesian people are mostly cheesy cringy and had hellbent toxic attitude, or just plain crappy at skills) {{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}} \n\nOkay now, all of this comes from my own internet connection. So you can't fix it. \n\nBut seriously? Constantly putting me on Leaverbuster and get into low tier because \"AFK\" is honestly unfair. Because I never been AFK. I never been \"Away From Keyboard\" because I'm struggling here, waiting to play the game, but it keeps \"Attempting to Reconnect\" sometimes.\n\nThe issue maybe didn't happens everyday. Sometimes I'm not even lagging at all. HOWEVER, I still don't think it's fair for me to constantly get punished for this. It's like punishing poor people for not eating properly. {{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}} \n\n\n(Also if you wanna see how bad my ping can goes, here's some links)\n\n**[PING TEST 1 ](https://orig00.deviantart.net/688c/f/2017/276/8/3/detygd_by_vermillionfenrir-dbpcbqh.png)** (This is when my ping are average high. Not really a nice day. When it's a nice day with nice weather, my ping only around 230. Regardless, ping around 500 still very playable and OK. What makes it unplayable is when the lag spikes happens)\n\n**[PING TEST 2](https://orig00.deviantart.net/7df3/f/2017/270/c/c/trsf_by_vermillionfenrir-dborqth.png)** (Meanwhile, this is when my connection goes really bad to point that it constantly disconnect. Look at that lag spikes. That's when I'm disconnecting)\n\n**[PING TEST 3](https://orig00.deviantart.net/142e/f/2017/276/d/9/thtrfg_by_vermillionfenrir-dbpcbhu.png)** (Another time when it goes so bad, unless this is THE WORST. Like, I never again receive lag spikes this outstandingly epic)","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-03T17:08:18.508+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sucks that this just seems to be getting worse.  :(  Leaverbuster is going to treat everyone equally because it still causes others a negative experience, so you may want to stop queuing up right now.  \n\nSubmitting a ticket was your best bet, as our tech team has the tools and context specific to your case.
