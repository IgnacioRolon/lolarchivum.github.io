This transforms him into a human-bullet : he hurts like a truck and he&#039;s fast as frick. ( could have gone for the rhyme, but nah )\n\nI&#039;m still taking Fleet Footwork on him because I love the sustain and going fast, but this is not the point of this thread.\n\n#HITBOXES.\n\nThis has already been noticed, but Jhin&#039;s Curtain Call ( R ) has a larger hitbox than what is indicated on the ground.\n\nHowever, I&#039;m not here to talk about Curtain&#039;s Call hitbox nor it&#039;s indicator.\n\n\n#Deadly Flourish ( W ) has a serious problem.\n\nI already knew the hitbox was obnoxious. Sometimes, as Jhin, I would root somebody when the &quot;laser&quot; ( since I&#039;m playing PROJECT : Jhin ) was slighly to the opponent&#039;s side, and not centered on them.\n\nAnother time, I was playing Kai&#039;Sa and thought I properly dodged it, but it hit me. At the time, I was thinking : &quot;Perhaps I was still in it after all since the hitbox is larger than you think.&quot;\n\nI didn&#039;t think about it that much.\n\nUntil yesterday.\n\n------------------------\n\n>#CASE 1 : \n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/ipFTbmQ.png[/img]\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/Dit80SS.png[/img]\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/uKrMErv.png[/img]\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/wQysGOn.png[/img]\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/VO1HM7F.png[/img]\n\nI actually didn&#039;t notice that one. I think I wouldn&#039;t have been hit by it, but since the hitbox is slighly larger than what it shows, I could have been rooted.\n\nIt wouldn&#039;t have killed me since I have the shield from Killer Instinct ( R ), but still.\n\n[ Click on the picture below to see the gif ]\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/fM32AYu.gifv\n\n>#CASE 2 :\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/ma3j5OA.png[/img]\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/QwZY4V5.png[/img]\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/9p2zm8m.png[/img]\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/OAZCCXA.png[/img]\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/afVGt2H.png[/img]\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/ubUC9Cn.png[/img]\n\nThis one is actually disgusting.\n\nAkali would have been killed by this Deadly Flourish. She had around 300 HP and Jhin&#039;s W had nearly 400 damage.\n\nI actually saw it while in-game, and while witnessing Akali&#039;s escape, I thought : &quot;What the f#ck? She should have been hit&quot;\n\n[ Click on the picture below to see the gif ]\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/0ezIJlp.gifv\n\n>#CASE 3\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/BF7z8VL.png[/img]\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/5RKmvFv.png[/img]\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/TIjfRXn.png[/img]\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/0kduapF.png[/img]\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/oxRFHtZ.png[/img]\n\nSince I&#039;ve only noticed how truly bullsh#t Deadly Flourish&#039;s hitbox was in this particular game, I&#039;ve decided to investigate.\n\nPerhaps it was a problem that only happened in this game?\nPerhaps it was a problem linked to the skin?\n\nTo both questions, the answer is NO. No, this issue happens whatever skin you pick, and will happen in every game.\n\n[ Click on the picture below to see the gif ]\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/LI1go6y.gifv\n\n>#CASE 4 \n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/L7Xorlx.png[/img]\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/8AWkRmb.png[/img]\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/DtffI8f.png[/img]\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/hz1ASF4.png[/img]\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/zESjHkO.png[/img]\n\nPeople have been pointing out to me that the fact that I was standing in the river directly affected how the hitbox would work, so I've tried it on a equal ground.\n\nThe problem is still there, but it's less \"broken\" than it was in the river.\n\n[ Click on the picture below to see the gif ]\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/BdhPFIj.gifv\n\n----------------------------\n\nThe hitbox starts at Jhin&#039;s feet, but once the shot goes off, the hitbox moves to the left. ( Jhin&#039;s left )\n\nThis is something that must be fixed because it&#039;s an issue for both Jhin players and players that are going against him :\n\n- Jhin players can hit their opponents when the shot should have missed.\n- Jhin players can miss their opponents when their shot should have hit.\n- Players going against Jhin can be hit by his W when they properly dodged it.\n\nEven though this Jhin was my opponent, I am beyond frustrated when I see the shot missing.\n\nPlease, fix Jhin&#039;s Deadly Flourish hitbox. Perhaps you can take a look at Jhin&#039;s Curtain Call too, but I&#039;ve done some tests on it, and it doesn&#039;t look as &quot;broken&quot; as the W hitbox is at the moment.\n\n----------------------\n\n>#CURTAIN CALL\n\n##Learn the DANGER ZONE and the SAFE ZONE.\n\nIt&#039;s that simple. You have to learn at which end of Curtain Call you&#039;re safe, but also the ones in which you can still be hit.\n\nFirst of all, you should NEVER linger near Jhin&#039;s Ultimate. \n\nYou&#039;ve managed to escape? As long as you&#039;re near Curtain Call&#039;s zone, you&#039;re as good as dead.\n\nDon&#039;t be cocky thinking you&#039;re the juke god : just get away as far as you can if you&#039;re low HP.\n\n##Here are the tests I&#039;ve done with Curtain Call&#039;s hitbox/range :\n\n>#From the side\n\nTest 1 :\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/G2GpXum.png[/img]\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/0IJtVc2.png[/img]\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/zGtbuxw.png[/img]\n\nTest 2 : \n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/yASNQ99.png[/img]\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/WdkkXm7.png[/img]\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/9Q2L509.png[/img]\n\nTest 3 :\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/vwTqOHk.png[/img]\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/KaJK5IL.png[/img]\n\n-------------------\n\n>#At the very end\n\nTest 1 :\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/fTVlhsr.png[/img]\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/OwBezRc.png[/img]\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/sW0Lz9S.png[/img]\n\nThis one is pretty weird. During Curtain Call, the arrow showed me that it was directed 100% towards the dummy, but here, it looks off.\n\nHowever, if you didn&#039;t know, Jhin&#039;s Curtain Call bullets have a larger hitbox than you think. You can be hit by the side of a bullet : that&#039;s how a teammate you were blocking for can be killed : you weren&#039;t perfectly aligned with your ally, thus leaving some space for Jhin&#039;s bullet to hit.\n\nIt happened to me, and I was the one blocking for a teammate. It felt like I failed my duty. :&#039;(\n\nTest 2 :\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/GG7C21z.png[/img]\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/KFjAivo.png[/img]\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/AIXOt8t.png[/img]\n\n------------------------\n\nPerhaps you think Curtain Call&#039;s range/hitbox must be addressed too.\n\nFor my part, I&#039;m used to it and know how it works. If Jhin kills me with his Ultimate, I&#039;ll either blame myself for not dodging or be impressed by the Jhin&#039;s accuracy.\n\nWhat needs to be fixed right now is Jhin&#039;s Deadly Flourish hitbox.\n\nI understand that there&#039;s more important issues at hand, but this needs to be addressed.\n\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this big thread.","replies":[{"poster":"AD Yuumi","date":"2018-08-20T01:15:02.630+0000","up_votes":42,"down_votes":17,"body":"Jhin's ultimate draws different indicator zones depending on what team you're on.  Jhin and his allies see a smaller zone, whereas enemies see a larger zone.

A number of particles have this issue, Jhin W and Lux R are most noticeable due to their extreme ranges.

He's probably making the point that the person _being hit_ should see the indicator properly displaying where they _can be hit_.\n\nI agree with you that JinxyLord's point is good and I agree with the point about manipulating player perception. But I also disagree with you and agree with Vioforte with regards to the player on the _receiving_ end of the skillshot. \n\n1) It's fine if you're hitting things that your screen it seems like it wouldn't have hit from your perspective. \n\n2) It's _not_ fine if the person _being hit_ is being hit by things that shouldn't hit them from their perspective. \n\n3) It's also not fine if you're _not_ hitting things that it visually looks like you hit, which is another issue that sometimes arises from things like this.\n\nWhile number 1 is good, I think 2 and 3 detract from the games entertainment value by seriously frustrating the player.\n\nI can't go a single day without flashing and then dying to something that should have either a) killed me before I could flash or b) shouldn't have hit me because I had flashed. I think a lot of it comes from similar issues in what one player is seeing and what the other player is seeing, but that's less of a hitbox issue and more spaghetti code and/or lag problems.","replies":[{"poster":"Fondling Gems","date":"2018-08-21T01:50:59.956+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with the points you made, but the way they made Jhin's visuals appear for different teams is to directly solve issues 2 and 3.\n\nBy making it appear larger to the receiving end it directly helps to ensure that you aren't hit by things that don't look like they would have hit you, and by making it visually smaller on the attackers end it helps make sure that you don't miss shots that you hit.\n\nYou say you don't agree with the way the receiving player's perspective is manipulated, then reinforce it with points about issues that the manipulation exists to solve.

If you read the third sentence of my original reply, you would recognize that I actually _agree with and support_ the visual manipulations.\n\nThat said, these visual manipulations currently have been implemented in such a way that often times issues such as:\n1) The person being hit while standing outside the hitbox indicator they see.\n2) The person firing the skillshot doesn't hit the person standing in the hitbox indicator they see.\n\nI agreed with Vioforte in that no person should be hit by a skillshot when standing outside the hitbox indicator _they_ see. (Not the person firing the skillshot.)\n\nI would go further to also say that no person should miss a skillshot when the target is standing inside the hitbox indicator the shooter sees. (That is to say, the projectile should hit the person it makes visual contact with or passes through.\n\nBasically I support the visual manipulations and think that they are great for the game.

It has nothing to do with cheaters, it is a simple mechanic of the game.  It does nothing to help them over other players.\n\n>Absolute half assed rng dependent indie game studio trash\n\nGonna ignore the second part of that, but it isn't rng in the slightest.  All opponents always see the same thing, and all allies always see the same thing.  Things like Corki Q have removed warning indicators and coloured circles for allies because it helps clear up teamfights.  In a similar way Jhin's abilities look different to allies and enemies.  It helps with clarity in teamfights (enemies attacks are more clearly defined, allies don't cluster the screen as much) and it creates a beneficial mental effect to both allies and opponents alike.\n\nNo one is getting cheated out of anything; the projectile is always the same, and it is clearly observable to opponents where they need to be to dodge.  To Jhin players they have slightly smaller area's to work with, but it really just results in them not missing when they feel like they should have hit.\n\nIt actually creates consistency by breaking it apart; and in a really well done way too.  Notice how in the 2+ years Jhin has been out no one has noticed that his abilities are slightly different for allies and enemies?  The manipulation is really subtle, but creates a more enjoyable and fair experience for players on both sides.\n\n>the real problem is that lol is actually 2D, so all skills originate from the actual FEET of each champ (point of ground collision), but since the graphics originate from the 'torso' or 'weapon' of the champs, there'll ALWAYS be a discrepancy which is affected by ROTATION of the camera and height of the character.\nTo fix this, it'd suffice that they draw an ADDITIONAL skill marker that originates from the 'visual' source of the skill so that you can actually see skill shot marker both from the actual and graphical source.\n\nUnfortunately this is one of the core sacrifices all games have to make.  I highly doubt you have ever played a game with 3d art that doesn't make this sacrifice.  To make league actually accurate Riot would have to completely trash the aesthetics of the game.  The visual result would have a far greater negative impact on the game than the \"added clarity\", which wouldn't actually add much clarity at all.\n\nOur brains can only process so much information so fast, and League already pushes that limit for even the best of players.  All those extra lines would result in such a messy look that it would most likely reduce clarity; it's a really interesting issue in game design actually.  For example if you made the particle effect for every linear skillshot ability very closely match it's actual hitbox you would very quickly see a drop in clarity due to it being hard to tell champion skills apart.\n\nOccasional wonky looking hitboxes are just the price League pays for the ability to tell skills apart as they come out of fog of war and you need to decide whether to flash or not.\n\n>Since LOL is a competitive pvp game, gamers expect that what they see is exactly what they get.\n\nFunny thing about human perception; it can actually be more effective to show someone what they expect something to look like than what it actually looks like.  That really is the whole point of the Jhin visual manipulation.  If Jhin players saw their ult box as large as it actually was they would _expect_ to be able to hit people when they couldn't, but by making it ever so slightly smaller it means that players can expect to hit something at the edge and actually hit it.  What Riot is doing is _fulfilling_ player's expectations of what their abilities can hit, rather than showing them the reality, because the reality would actually result in players expecting something beyond what they see.\n\nSuccessful games rely so much on showing people a lie so that their expectations fit reality because if you show them reality their expectations would actually be incorrect.  The human brain is a bitch eh?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Ciller","date":"2018-08-20T06:44:59.812+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":6,"body":"I wonder if coding a game isn't as simple as all you seem to make it sound.
