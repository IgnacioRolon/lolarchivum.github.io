My ears died already and I don&#039;t want yours to fall to the same fate. \r\n\r\nWhen trying to view a highlight that I create, I have the sound replaced with a very loud ear piercing static noise that kills ears upon normal volume.  Has happened in both patch 6.22 and 6.23.\r\n\r\nSteps to create:\r\n1. Used the download replay in the post game lobby\r\n2. Created the highlight using the recording feature now in the replays.\r\n3. Went to where the highlight was saved and opened it in Google Chrome.\r\n4. Listened to my hearing fade as blood filled my ears.\r\n\r\nThis is happening to me every time I try to create a highlight.\r\n\r\nHope this helps.  Haven&#039;t seen anything about this so far.","replies":[{"poster":"Dooomba","date":"2016-11-28T22:12:42.649+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I have the same problem, tried in VLC player and firefox and still get that same type of screech.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ragecon The Wise","date":"2017-05-01T11:22:58.296+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"+1","replies":[]},{"poster":"The3cho","date":"2017-04-18T23:15:59.437+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bump for emphasis.
