Considering all the help and effort people like me put into this i should be unbanned it would help a lot in my free time when im not working, please help to try to get me unbanned riot i am currently in the USMC so if you could help that would be amazing :D","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Tantram","date":"2016-03-01T18:49:03.375+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you feel you were unjustly banned, post your chat log and I'd be happy to go over it with you.","replies":[{"poster":"Jak147","date":"2016-03-01T18:58:13.161+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":9,"body":"Game 1\nJak147: what makes you hate me?\nJak147: mf\nJak147: 1 ap?\nJak147: im god\nJak147: no autographs\nJak147: whjat\nJak147: i told you back\nJak147: dont stay that low\nJak147: why teemo jg\nJak147: its not good buddy\nJak147: gj\nJak147: ezreal is bad\nJak147: he uses e to farm\nJak147: going blue ez\nJak147: i thinik he flashed\nJak147: that stupid ass dmg\nJak147: he has 3 shit items\nJak147: YO MF DO SOMETHING\nJak147: holy shit youre bad\nJak147: sad\nJak147: report eemo\nJak147: teemo\nJak147: teemo jg isnt viable this season and hes trolling ;)\nJak147: yeah you are bude\nJak147: only saying cause youre winning fgaf\nJak147: fyi nasus is countered by malphite\nJak147: lol mf shit talks then leaves\nJak147: hes talking blue\nJak147: taking*\nJak147: ezreal no flash\nJak147: 88 ap\nJak147: thunderlords\nJak147: you messed up\nJak147: you flashed too early\nJak147: you missed some\nJak147: blue ezreal aint that good\nJak147: k\nJak147: nami ez no ults\nJak147: why\nJak147: nami heals way to much\nJak147: cause youre bad kiddo\nJak147: not really\nJak147: this kid thinks ignorance is funny worst mf ever\nJak147: mf thinks ignorance is funny\nJak147: report mf salty and bad xD\nJak147: lol okay bud\nJak147: cause i am?\nJak147: lol\nJak147: lol nasus stacks xD\nJak147: no i just have a good life, you seem like a bag of lays chips\nJak147: lol youre a child\nJak147: lol this teemo is better than the mf and he isnt so mean\nJak147: teemo youre doing good keep it up buddy\nJak147: its not doesnt mean he cant exectue\nJak147: this mf is so salty\nJak147: you cant use bud\nJak147: bud\nJak147: report mf keeps leaving\nJak147: and came late\nJak147: not blaming\nJak147: just truth\nJak147: chill kid\nJak147: stop going alone\nJak147: group to win\nJak147: ward more\nJak147: no\nJak147: group\nJak147: we need 5v5\nJak147: we have poke\nJak147: kill talon and ez\nJak147: teemo\nJak147: stop coming late\nJak147: stop going late\nJak147: if youre gonna make orders\nJak147: stick with the team\nJak147: dont be salty\nJak147: baron\nJak147: SEE ITS EASY\nJak147: we win 5v5s\nJak147: we need to stay grouped\nJak147: report mf\nJak147: gj\nJak147: stop leaving\nJak147: no cause mf is trolling and leaving\nJak147: trying\nJak147: selling support items\nJak147: stay at base\nJak147: group up\nJak147: teemo\nJak147: imma protect you\nJak147: gg report mf\nJak147: bg this mf salty and constantly leaving\n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}}","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Tantram","date":"2016-03-01T19:11:49.727+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":0,"body":"So, the first thing I see here is that you are exhibiting a lot of verbal toxicity towards MF.\n\n> Jak147: YO MF DO SOMETHING\nJak147: holy shit youre bad\nJak147: this kid thinks ignorance is funny worst mf ever\nJak147: mf thinks ignorance is funny\n\nSecondly, calling for reports is generally considered harassment.

Even if this chat was just light enough to earn a small chat restriction (it wasn't) it still would have ended up being a perma ban.\n\nI hope this helps explain the ban a little better and you don't feel it is \"for no reason\". The community as a whole does not tolerate harassment. It is you and your fellow summoners that dictate what is considered acceptable and not acceptable.","replies":[{"poster":"swordartonlineyi","date":"2016-03-05T00:38:36.496+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"RIOT FEEDERSLIVESMATTER. \n\nSo the first thing here is your words towards MF. Though your words are not exceptionally toxic, you should already know that most of the community we created is ignorant and reminding them might hurt their feelings. As for the MF, uhm**** has thrown and fed in several of his previous games, therefore it's important we protect his feelings so frustrated summoners in bronze 1 have to spend more time and money to achieve Silver 5. Thanks for understanding and hopefully you spend money on the next account you create too. We would love to take it, ban you for words, and repeat this process as many times as you feel necessary to subject to.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-03-01T17:58:38.434+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Punishments are dealt in 4 steps;\n\n* 10 game chat restriction\n* 25 game chat restriction\n* 14 day account ban\n* Permanent account ban\n\nAsking to mass report a player is harassment, and punishment is calculated per match not report; in other words, it does no good and potentially causes harm. If you were permabanned for just what you said you did, then you've been working up to this tier of punishment for a while already and had a 14 day account ban recently. It takes 3 months for your punishment tier to drop down 1 step.\n\nI suggest posting your reform card.","replies":[{"poster":"HelioLunar","date":"2016-03-01T23:04:53.040+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-03-01T23:09:03.892+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You didn't get permabanned for saying fuck.
