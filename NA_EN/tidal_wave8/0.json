When in the danger zone, this rocket is supposed to be a purple. I noticed that whenever I use a harpoon at 40 heat to get me into the danger zone, and then use another harpoon, the harpoon still has the non-danger zone visual. Furthermore, any harpoons I cast afterwards for a period, whether in the danger zone or not, are all the orange regular color. I&#039;m hoping it&#039;s just a visual glitch, but I&#039;m also wondering if it isn&#039;t applying the extra damage and slow since the visual is off.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-04-04T17:50:50.399+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Tidal Wave8 - \n\nThanks for the report! I'd be happy to look into this today! ^-^ \n\nAs a note, this should be something purely visual, and shouldn't affect the damage of the ability!","replies":[]}]}
