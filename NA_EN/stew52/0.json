They won&#039;t lock in their champ until the very end of champ select and never call a role (they only appear in blind queue as far as I have seen). They use the default runes and never change them to suit their champion. They lack an form of real self preservation instinct and will just stand their either attacking minions or the closest enemy champion until death.\r\n\r\nMore than likely what is happening is these people are using some kind of program which has an AI that can control characters in league of legends which they are using to level accounts to then sell on account websites for free money. This needs to stop as it is ruining the experience of low MMR players and low level accounts who are legitimately playing with some games literally being based on which ever team has the bot loses as the enemy farms it and advances their game state very quickly until the bot starts to be worth only 50 gold due to it&#039;s repeated deaths.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-06-24T21:08:30.285+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You know that new anticheat system that has been causing problems lately?\n\nYeah.
