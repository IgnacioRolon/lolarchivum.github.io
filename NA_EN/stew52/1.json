Mordekaiser was made WEAKER with the removal of DFG so riot lowered his base HP regen, lowered the damage on his w and didn&#039;t really do anything to help him all that much (His w gives him movement speed towards the target, this would help him to escape ganks but the time it takes to get to the minion (Usually walking towards him) is the same time it takes to walk towards it normally, With no mobility he can&#039;t risk using his ult on most champions in the game because of their high mobility. He is being forced into more of a tank role now than an ap battle mage, In my opinion being a tank with no cc makes you almost useless, you can&#039;t peel for your team if you just get ignored and with his average base damage without ap or magic penetration you get ignored by all but the softest of the enemy, How are you ment to be a tank for you team if they just jump over you to your carrys? As a mage he used to be able to burst with his ult and DFG combo after he burned both of those he became a sustained damage dealer with his pet and his base abilities but without DFG to go with his ult he can no longer burst an adc down fast enough before being cc locked, poked back or the adc life steals back to enough hp (It was hard enough to get within range of the adc in the first place). Mordekaiser was one of the first champs I played when I started this game in the start of season 3, I love this champion but I don&#039;t understand what he is meant to be in his current state, a tank with no cc, a mage with low range and limited burst or a sustained damage dealer with low range, no gap closers, no cc and no mobility? I am bronze but that doesn&#039;t mean my opinion is worthless.\n\ntl;dr - The removal of DFG nerfed mordekaiser, riot then nerfed him again afterwards even though they said they would give them \"a little love\", he is now hardly able to burst as an AP mage and as a tank he has no cc making him un-able to peel. Not viable anymore in current meta and riot need to learn that not all love needs to hurt.\n\nStew52","replies":[{"poster":"Matezoide","date":"2015-05-07T18:20:01.478+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":4,"body":"Dont forget the ghost nerfs.\n\nBefore his ghost would receive 75% of Mord's AP, which in turn would boost his own further (Giving Mordekaiser around 15% of his AP). Since his ghost doesnt gain AP anymore, Morde wont receive the boost unless his target built AP to begin with.\n\nGhost would also receive 75% of Mord's AD, but now it gains a flat bomus (25/50/100). This is a nerf to his early and mid game, while being a small buff to his late _if_ he didnt build a Gunblade.\n\n\nSeriously, Mord and Veigar's compensation nerfed them harder than Zed's nerf lol","replies":[{"poster":"Baron of Bread","date":"2015-05-08T05:02:57.412+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly to me the ghost changes were good.  You are no longer relegated to ulting the enemy ADC.  You could take the enemy APC (more AP) or tank (more HP) now and they can still hit people for damage since he buffs their AD.","replies":[{"poster":"Matezoide","date":"2015-05-08T05:27:19.605+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"But heres the thing, you always could take any ghost as Mord.\n\nAPCs would provide you with even more AP than currently because before, the ghost would get some of Mordekaiser's AP. Mord also got AD from APCs, which was nice.\n\nADCs would also get Mordekaiser's AP, which means he is getting AP and AD.\n\nBefore, Mord would get at least 15% of his Total AP as a bonus just for gaining a ghost. Now he needs to ult a mage.\n\n\nMord also used to give 75% of his AD to a ghost, which is greater than the current flat 25 at level 6 and 50 at level 11. Ghost only gets more AD at level 16, but only if he didnt build a Gunblade.","replies":[{"poster":"Baron of Bread","date":"2015-05-08T07:58:33.037+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You could take any damage dealer as a ghost as Morde.  Now you are actually rewarded for ulting the tank with more than just extra healing.  Also, APCs can give you more now since they grant 30% of their AP now, and they probably build more than you do since you usually have to spend a bit on not getting blown up.  Also, how often do you build Gunblade on Morde?\n\nI will agree that he isn't rewarded quite as much for ulting the enemy ADC as he used to be, but I like that.  I enjoy knowing that if I ult the tank for a big heal and a lot of Max HP shred I didn't waste it.  I enjoy feeling like ulting the enemy ADC isn't always the best option.  That and it also makes more sense that he isn't getting AP from someone who had none.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Stew52","date":"2015-05-07T20:19:26.600+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"True.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"5000000000000000","date":"2015-05-07T17:34:20.737+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":7,"body":"But lowered health cost?

He has always been a sustained, AoE, AP damage machine and the changes didn't actually change that.  Yes, the changes weren't great for him.  However, if you are willing to adapt, you can come out better off from it.  I did [the math](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/83QNaaX6-mordes-hp5-is-ridiculously-low-for-a-health-based-caster?comment=000c) and he loses less hp per minute than old Morde if you switch to maxing Q first.  Sure, Q might not be as optimum as E for damage and harass, but it is a better first max currently because of the health cost changes.\n\nAlso, I don't remember a single meta where he was considered viable (except sorta in the assassin meta, since he could counter most of them in lane).\n\nI would love for them to return a bit of his HP/5, but he is still a good top lane pick (haven't spent enough time in mid to say anything about that) and giving him buffs might push him over the edge.","replies":[{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2015-05-08T07:39:05.548+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Even with E max you still lose less hp.","replies":[{"poster":"Baron of Bread","date":"2015-05-08T08:04:13.912+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't see how you figured that.

The masteries/runes also don't matter because you could have those on old Morde and whether you max E or Q or even W first on new Morde.\n\nYou have higher base damage over time with Q max first (50/sec as opposed to 41.7/sec, unless you get single target damage then it is 82.5 to 41.7), so if you trade with an opponent regularly (say, every time Q is up) then you will do more with Q than E.  Yes, E can do more total damage to a wave and hits from a range, but if you are against a melee then that isn't really worth the lower damage and greater health costs.  If you are against a ranged then go with whichever you prefer.\n\nEnds can justify means, but I don't see how that applies.
