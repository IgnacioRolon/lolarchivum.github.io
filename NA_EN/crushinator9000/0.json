He&#039;s great to play if people don&#039;t immediately quit the game when they see you&#039;re trying to pick him.\r\n\r\nI&#039;ve done well with Ivern but it takes a serious team effort which many people don&#039;t have a concept of or are not willing to accept.\r\n\r\nThe idea of Ivern is better than the actual champ, in my opinion. His ulti is almost pointless, if you just run from Daisy, it&#039;s stun thing will never get you. This makes me sad, I like Ivern :(\r\n\r\nMy thoughts are, maybe make his ulti a summon. Make it so when you click to active daisy, you can select a spot, some flowers grow for a second, a second later daisy pops out and stuns or damages people. That would be much better rather than Daisy just popping out and running around like a moron. This would at least make Daisy useful for a second before it runs around and dies.\r\n\r\nPlease make Ivern an acceptable champ.\r\n\r\nYou are free to hate on my comments now.","replies":[{"poster":"Big Lincoln","date":"2016-11-09T21:18:32.745+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"remove his ability to instantly steal my camps and I would be happy to see him buffed","replies":[]},{"poster":"Unstoppable Monk","date":"2016-11-09T21:16:48.545+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ivern is broken in the right hands","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tenth Leper","date":"2016-11-09T17:19:03.949+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"greenfather's gift helps, and redemption was basically made for him. also he was just buffed for the 2nd time","replies":[{"poster":"Crushinator9000","date":"2016-11-09T17:31:46.193+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Awesome, anything helps!","replies":[]}]}]}
