So when the damage is lacking I look to pick up trist to make up for the faults on my team that could cause issues for us in the long run.\nVayne, This is just both of those above combined for when I have been playing at my best and can help lead my team to victory.\n\nStrengths: I would have to say positioning is one of my strengths, as well as following the lead of my team. I tend to try and roam with my support when given the chance and things of the like. \n\nWeakness: CSing and decision making. \nI normally end up trading instead of farming and lose a good 2-3 creeps in the process of that. Normally by 1hp or something of the likes. I also constantly overvalue myself in game and find myself pushing into fights that my team never had a hope of winning and throwing the game away into the trash.\n\nHeadset + Discord?: Yes, I have both.\n\nTimes you play: I tend to play from around 4pm Central to 2-3am central. On weekends I am normally on all the time.\n\nWhy you? : I feel it is a skill based game that I can learn to better communicate in a team set, and learn to work with people instead of taking everything on myself.\nNot to mention I, myself, find the game fun and such. \nThen there are friends, who I can often find on and spend time with.\nThanks for taking the time to read this and I appreciate any consideration.","replies":[]},{"poster":"NoobTangerang","date":"2017-09-10T21:55:00.361+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Playing Since Season: 5\nCurrent Rank: Diamond 5\nHighest Rank: Diamond 4\nMain Position: Mid\nTime in Role: \nTop 3 Champs & Why: Fizz. I've been playing him since I joined league and his kit and play style is just really fun to work with in my opinion, but I am willing to try other champions down the road. I just wanted to stick to one to get better at it until reaching masters to understand the game.\nStrengths: Laning\nWeakness: Confidence, Tilting\nHeadset + Discord?: Both\nTimes you play: It depends on school and how much HW I get. I have a lot of time in weekend evenings, unless it's crammed with homework. In the weekdays, I can get one or two games in, but like I said before, it depends on the amount of HW I get.\nWhy you? : The competitive aspect of this game has kept me playing it for 3 seasons. I love the competitiveness and only want to get better so I can compete with the top players. I always want to increase my knowledge of the game and enjoy being criticized as it can help a lot to improve my game.

Orianna, I loveeee orianna she's honestly so much fun. I love having the ability to carry the game or change a losing game into a winning one with a well placed ult. Corki, I just picked him up and I've found him to be a lot of fun. He's pretty strong right now and since playing lane passively is something I enjoy doing, it helps cater to my playstyle.\nStrengths: Warding up for my team, Communication, Teamfights, listening to shotcalls, adapting to the meta, csing (I have been practicing my csing but my average with just last hitting comes out to be 38/44 by 5:05)\nWeakness: Map Awareness, Being aggressive in lane, smart wards while laning (Basically laning in general), Macro play\nHeadset + Discord?: I have both\nTimes you play: I play everyday in the evening.

I am super competitive and strive to become the best in my passions. I'm currently on a team and everyone on it is diamond or high plat and I feel like my inexperience is holding them back a little. My macro game isn't the strongest so I listen to shotcalls, but I want to be able to make smart decisions on my own or help carry the team in some way. I sincerely want to get better and have been watching faker and bjergsen play. I have also been regularly practicing csing for about 30-60 minutes a day and learning the combos on champions I struggle on.

Was a Top main before that\nTop 3 Champs & Why: Lucian is my number 1 I love how mobile he is and all of his outplay potential in his kit aswell as the team play aspects he brings. I played him since he came out and have loved him since even through the nerfs. My second would be probably Trist. With everything she brings to the team she is a all around great champ to play between he super strong range at max level and her tower pushing capabilities you can hardly go wrong with her. My 3rd would be Ashe. Once again because of the amount of team play she brings with her ult for ingages and her hawkshot to spot the jungler in his rought.\nStrengths: My biggest strength i would have to say is my time in the game. I have learned alot over the years but i also do understand that i do still have alot to learn. I am very humble and understand that i am not amazing and that I have alot of work i still have to do to be good. I am very commited to the game and am getting back into heavily playing after having to do alot of traveling for work and not having the ability to play much this year.\nWeakness: I am very bad with certain things in game that i have been working on alot to get better at. Timings, active items, extencive map awarness, and some other things. I play to many champs at a time instead of spamming one at a time to learn the ins and outs of them one by one. I have trouble with losing my focus in games or in the vise versa focusing to hard on certain things which i have been working on but still struggle with a bit. I am overly harsh on myself on my mistakes especially ones i know i shouldn't be making which eventually tilts me. Weak with lane matchup knowledge and rotations in the early-mid game.\nHeadset + Discord?: I have both a headset and discord\nTimes you play: I play anytime between 2pm-6am EST on monday through friday. and free anytime on the weekends.\nWhy you? : I have always taken the game very seriously. Have had teams in smaller tournaments and have always tryed to be the best i can be at the game. I have played for a RMU so i have some experience with being coached already but would really like to persue being coached again and build on the basis that i was already working on before to become better at the game. I am commited to the game fully and play it in most of my free time and always seek to improve. Still do alot of the stuff i did to help me back in college when i played to improve and would like to learn more ways to help me improve aswell as get expert opinions and guidence on alot of things. I have alot of goals to get back into team play cuz i have a strong competative drive and love working with teams. Aswell as self goals to keep climbing as much as i can.

Be skeptical all you want, I am not interested in playing with you. \nThank you for the interest though.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Me Best No Flame","date":"2017-09-10T18:39:06.967+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi, been playing since S5\nCurrent rank is Silver 5,\nHighest Rank was Silver 1\nMain Position is ADC and Supp\nBeen practicing AD and supp since preseason,\nTop 3 Champs: My Fav champ is Ryze because of his unique kit with shield and kiting, \nFavorite ADC is lucian because of his strong passive and dashing in and out, \nLast favorite is Cassiopeia because of decent laning and can carry team fights\nStrengths: I think my strengths are map awareness/warding because of supporting, I watch streams every day (LCS, QT, Pants, Etc.) \nI try to practice every day on the things that I watch and learn, like LeagueCraft Videos (trading stance, rotations after first turret, proper teamfighting)\nWeaknesses: Don't trust team mates to do their jobs, find myself lacking in engages. Hard to find chemistry with team\nYes Headset and Discord\nI try to play every day usually afternoon around 1 until around 8\nI think even for my low elo I have committed to learning the game and getting better on my own. When I first started playing the game my cousin told me I could never get challenger, and even though all the statistics around me telling me I suck and I will never get challenger, I really push myself to learn everyday win or lose. But i still want to win xd","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mizukagë","date":"2017-09-10T18:24:55.946+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Playing Since Season: 2\nCurrent Rank: P4\nHighest Rank: P2\nMain Position: Mid\nTime in Role: 3 seasons\nTop 3 Champs & Why: Ahri (CC+mobile)    Lux (High dmg+ Long range)  Fizz (high dmg + mobile)\nStrengths: map awareness \nWeakness: Over confidence \nHeadset + Discord?: yes + yes\nTimes you play: 8 AM -5 PM\nWhy you? : ive been looking to improve ive been stagnant in the same role for 3 years and it demotivates me","replies":[]},{"poster":"MysterQ","date":"2017-09-10T18:18:08.796+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why Me?\nI may not meet your criteria. I want to get better at this game, but I am not aiming for challenger (I mean it just seems unlikely). I started to play with my friend, but there is just a large skillgap between us and it feels bad. I would like to be able to play on an even field with my friend (Plat) without him feeling like I am bad or he has to carry.\nAt the same time, I would just like to make some real friends to play with often. I have had friends off and on in LoL, but for some reason or other we move on.\n\nSo I want to get better, I don't want to be carried, I want some friends.\nI did start an alt account months ago to practice my ADC (it buys ADs with my IP). \n\nPlaying since season: November Season 6\nCurrent rank: Silver 1, probably like Silver 5 in non-support\nHighest rank: Silver 1\n\nMain position: Support, although I am in debate\nTime in Role: 6 months (started season 7 at Top/jg)\nTop 3 champs: Support has changed a lot recently. If I had to pick, Sona, Taric.\n\nStrength: Want to improve, willing to follow team calls (in desperate situations, bad situations), very rarely give up\nWeakness: Fear in lane, lane control/cs. There are more but I think my laning need most work\n\nHeadset. Discord: All forms of voice speak, mic, no headset (do footsteps matter)\nTimes you play: Central standard time. Schedule varies (monthly school changes). Right now often 3pm, but I am most often awake at 8pm-2am.","replies":[]},{"poster":"463","date":"2017-09-10T18:22:50.167+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Wait did you just make a new post? Lol.\n\nI'll redo my application I guess ._.\n\nPlaying Since Season: S1 ( played for fun with friends until S4 )\nCurrent Rank: P4 ( Decay from D2 ) I've been playing on a smurf to practice though, so I don't have games on this account ( 463 )\nHighest Rank: D2\nMain Position: AD / Supp\nTime in Role: Since S3\nTop 3 Champs & Why: Cait , Sivir , Twitch - Easily for me to stay safe so I don't become a liability to my team, also I play Cait the most.\nStrengths: Laning in general and staying alive\nWeakness: Ironically dying to unexpected combos in team fights and generally map movement ( anything outside of laning )\nHeadset + Discord?: Yes\nTimes you play: Any day of the week except Tuesdays 1pm - 4pm ( Piano lessons )\n\nWhy you? : I'm already dedicating my own time to taking notes on my gameplay and I'm gradually getting back to my prior level. I think I have a lot of room in game knowledge department to expand on, and I know first hand the amount of work it takes for hardstuck D2 to Masters. I'm ready to put in serious effort to improve myself. I have a growth mindset and fully aware that solo Q to the top is based on your own individual performance.\n\nI'm willing to go for challenger this season or the next. I don't wanna end my league career at D2, it's a little embarrassing lol.","replies":[]}]}
