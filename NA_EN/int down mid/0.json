Ever since then, I've been getting random 1-2 seconds full on freezing while playing league of legends. It only occurs while playing LoL, no issues with any other games. I have a powerhouse pc so I know its not a hardware issue. The freezes occur usually once at the most twice during an entire game, and generally last no longer than 2 seconds. If anyone else has been having this issue and knows a fix, I'd greatly appreciate it.\r\n\r\nThanks, Simo","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-06T15:20:25.410+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"A recent Windows 10 update caused the [Xbox Game Bar ](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html) game bar to not play well with League.

My only solution was to do a hard computer restart and I missed most of a game (and returned to an angry response). I played again and was okay for whatever reason.
