Yorick seems like he&#039;d be a priority because his playstyle is oppressive, resulting in him being pretty weak and binary (win the lane, lose the game). He also seems like he fits the \"Juggernaut\" fantasy really well (low mobility, high dueling/damage capacity with tankiness).

And in the \"weakness\" department he has: is very kitteable, and don't have AoE, low mobility etc. So Riot need to make more stronger and weaker his  \"strenghtness\" and \"weakness\", and also give him more \"uniquess\" in his kit, some things that make him feel more like a Berseker, for example that gains \"X\" stats when enters in a fight and increase with the duration of Olaf in fight, because he loves fight, and also turn more and more stronger when he is fighting and is very nearly to death too. A new passive that give him stats depend of the amount of time that he is in a fight. Now I think that his E turn more stronger when he is weak (missing health part damage portion). and with these two changes he make more clearly his identity, move his actual passive to his W, and remove the atk spd steroid on his kit. So he keeps Strong 1 vs 1 but weak in AoE fights, have a solid counter-engage juggernaut thematic. \n\nShyvanna has more problems in the \"uniquess\" of her kit,  because jas a low mobility but she is good in a lot of things and not have a real wealness right now, so Riot need to do somthing that make her feel moew unique and offer to the game, new things.","replies":[]},{"poster":"warpenguin555","date":"2015-09-05T17:39:43.995+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=hOynE5hj,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-09-05T09:22:13.082+0000)\n>\n> The Yorick rework Xelnath was experimenting with did get ice boxed.

I really had high hopes for rework, followed it every day, every hour, every update.  When Morgageddon was brought in (and hired) saying that he'd played a version where the ultimate was a mana draining Locus of Power I was thinking, holy damn, this is going to be a great rework, I'd still be able to enjoy my main.  As the posts came in and the fact that there would be no manner of root, and V.5 showed up on PBE I was like, okay, I guess this is fun, but... just, not Xerath.  You know who it felt like i was playing, Velkoz..... It felt like Xerath's rework was basically a warm up to making Velkoz.  So anyways, I figured okay, maybe V.6 or V.7+ will potentially revert back to being a Locus of Power variation.  Maybe Riot will let actual players try and test out the version of Xerath that had actually been spoken up.  Then we're on V.9, and it's just fixing up problems with making the E not having an odd slow start with a wind-up to be fast, or adjusting how W actually works, and the numbers on his passive (such as removing the free % magic penetration that QWE were given).  And then.... I'm realizing... welp... I guess I won't be able to play ranked next season, or ever again well.  And so then it was just a gradual downfall as I stopped caring about even normal 5v5 league of legends, and the only thing that mattered to me was just the stupid fast fun games of ARAM. ARAM ARAM ARAM ARAM and a bit of dominion when my friend got me too.  AND THEN that bestfriend of mine who I really enjoyed playing League with is like bro, I can't play League with you if you're going to be like this.  And I'm like I'm sorry dude, but I just really get tired of blazing away the day doing nothing with my life but playing bloody aram as I really rather did enjoy the few times of playing ranked, but hey whats the point in playing ranked if the hero I enjoy doing it with will be completely changed, maybe I'll just play the only successful fun rework that is Heimerdinger.  And so eventually that friend and I because distanced because he said that the person who I had become \"was just a character I was playing as\" which was something I obviously knew, and avoided thinking about, because the very character I live my life as is avoiding thinking about anything.  So that's the story of how Riot reworking Xerath was in part the catalyst to my life going to shit.  If Riot had never suggested the rework then over the summer of 2013 when I reached Plat 2 in 2 months flat just playing a few ranked games a day, I would have spent more time trying to find people to play seriously with (and not eventually said fuck it to living with an elder sibling soberly) instead of obsessing over every when Xelnath would next post an update with actually specifications to rework plans.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Penta Penguin","date":"2015-09-05T20:58:33.695+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That honestly sounds really lame, I never saw Yorick as a split-pusher siege champion","replies":[]},{"poster":"Daetnas","date":"2015-09-05T20:24:39.623+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's a bit disappointing to be honest.

(way more than that.) Mianly because i ddint enjoy being a part of playing the champions that have dashes, or built in armor pen, or attack speed steroids, or ridiculous amounts of cc. His actual main issue is that he has no hard cc. other champions that do seem to have a higher win rate because locking down an individual and doing that over and over seems to work well. Teams that revolve around this have the best teamfights as well. lokcing down your opponent and making sure they cant move or cast spells over the course of 2 seconds, with a gank from a jungler that has good cc (Vi,  Udyr) just stack the stun right after the other has worn off and you have yourself a flash or a garunteed FB. Yoricks biggest weakness is solo queue because so many people forget his Zombie Form ULT and often run away or just sit there. its best if you just ult the adc or yourself and benifit from unholy covenants bonus for a much longer duration. Take attention from the enemy team, cast your skills and draw them into your team. If your team is smart enough or nice enough or arent cowardly they should SEE that you just took most of the enemies cooldowns and can counter attack. Like alistar Gaining about 20% dmg reduction with all minions including revenant, you should come out fine healing and with a boost of speed from your kit. find a nearby minion/jungle monster cast e heal and get back in the fight. Now riot hasnt made much changes to yorick i cant believe they hate him too much. They buffed him a bit by giving him a little range for his q which makes a ghoul shower combo easier to get off and the attack reset has never felt better. There are new items that came out this year like Black Cleaver for example that even his ghouls can apply. Another one i enjoy is Death Dance which grants his ghouls an on hit heal and buffs the E ghoul even more since the on hit heal is already its passive. Thorn mail and Sunfire cape are great as well, seeing how thinking of yoricks ghouls are \"an aura of dmg\" only if they successfully land hits which they do at least land one. The magic dmg from thornmail and sunfire make it like you have 5 ghouls instead of the 3, on top of that your ult and if you build ice born so enemies cant get away. and the new manamune is really nice too. now who uses that item more than anyone else? now yorick is strong but he can be countered by stuns since they prevent him from summoning, he also doesnt have a gap close. His movement speed isnt free either you have to land your auto attack first along with thee worst base attack speed in the game. meanwhile champions like garen and shyvanna have free movement speed buffs upon activation. This game is more than about who you pick to play. ive lost as jungle Vi going 18/2/14 simply because my team had no idea where to be or what to do. and junglers are always stingly about jungle gold UNLESS they are trying to finish devourer then ill understand. Not sure why people complain about wards when everyone starts off with free wards and it takes a fraction of a second to place. TOO many times have i seen people follow pro players in solo queue with like top graves or top quinn or something when you could just pick shen or darius and win the game. Give your team what it needs, instead of being a selfish showoff. Kills matter but to a point same with farming. if games can end potentially at 20 mins now why do they sometimes last for 40? why do master yis stay in the jungle and some udyrs never gank even after devourer has been built. too many people play this game and they either arent as good or just simply dont care or just wanna PVE. No one ever talks about the nexus. Anyways i do agree Yorick needs a rework, change his W to a knock up/slow. (thats not too op cho gath has it.) make his E a skill shot then if he misses no E ghoul/take away the heal and have it just deal damage or apply a DOT or reduce armor/make it a silence instead of  a heal. Maybe when his shovel is glowing from his Q activation he can choose to devour one of his ghouls for NOT AN INSTANT HEAL but an over time heal. a HOT if you will, since its such an issue. maybe casting Q E ghouls once they are close together and if you aim W on top of them they become the BLIGHTED GHOULS THAT EXPLODE. Perhaps make is passive a leveling thing/reward. leveling like sunfire where he gains X dmg and X defense times his current level plus a bonus if he buries fallen champions. You guys know how champions dead bodies just sit there? Why cant he just bury them and gain a permanent effect for it like his job title says? There are so many different ways that riot can go about this. Ill be happy as long as hes a tank/fighter. i enjoy defending my mages and adc in teamfights. Denying kills feels better to me than getting kills. also why do tanks/bruisers like garen and darius get executions Rs? Even cho gath has that too and cho gath to me personally is far worse to face. pretty brainless champion too, and if you say \"well you gotta aim his stuff and its not target cast.\" well guess what Those spells cover a lot of area and deal a lot of damage. Silence plus knock up plus slow?! HA talk about easy chow downs on yorick.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fizz In My Annie","date":"2016-02-26T17:30:08.172+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So far even riot has not remembered yorick moree","replies":[]},{"poster":"ryancup","date":"2016-02-07T21:15:55.458+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So... now that poppy and xerath has been reworked, is yorick coming up soon?","replies":[]},{"poster":"d4rkshock","date":"2016-01-24T08:52:52.080+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He lacks counter play but is a completely useless champion after the lanning phase.
