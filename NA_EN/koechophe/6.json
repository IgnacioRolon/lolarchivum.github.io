Attack damage is 30g per 1 point. It _sounds_ like the defensive stats should be more efficient, right?\r\n\r\nHere&#039;s the problem. High-end armor items vs high end AD items, AD gets a huge kick to efficiency that armor doesn&#039;t have. Let&#039;s look at some of the usual suspects\r\nBloodthirster: 80 AD, 20% Lifesteal, 3500 gold, 101% gold efficient w/o passive\r\nRavenous Hydra: 80 AD, 12% lifesteal, 100% hp regen, 101% gold efficient without its passives\r\nRageblade: 25 AD, 25 AP, 25% attack speed, 3300 gold. 73% gold efficient without passive, jumps to 125% gold efficiency at 6 stacks, further increased by 17% for every 100 AD and 11% for every 100 AP. \r\nYoumuu&#039;s ghostblade: 2900 gold, 55 AD, 10% cdr. 90% gold efficient without passive/active, 106% gold efficient while out of combat and 133% gold efficient while using active. \r\n\r\nNow compare with high-end armor/hp items.\r\nSunfire cape: 2900 gold, 60 armor, 425 hp. 80% gold efficient without passive.\r\nRanduin&#039;s omen: 2900 gold, 400 hp, 60 armor. 78% gold efficient without its passive or active.\r\nThornmail: 2900 gold, 80 armor, 250 hp. 74.71% gold efficient without passives\r\n\r\nThe numbers are clear and easy to understand. Damage is far, far more gold efficient, and far more slot efficient.\r\n\r\n**But wait, there&#039;s more**\r\n1) Running conqueror can reduce the gold efficiency of all armor/mr items by a flat 20%\r\n2)Hp burn drastically reduces the efficiency of building any form of hp\r\n3)There&#039;s more true damage in the game now than there&#039;s ever been before\r\n4)Damage helps secure objectives far more effectively than defense does\r\n5)Damage items have actives which are far more effective than defensive items \r\n6)Armor shred is more popular than ever, as well as armor pen\r\n7)Damage users can itemize damage and increase their effectivity against everyone. Tanks have to itemize specifically armor or MR to increase their effectivity against only one or the other.\r\n\r\n**TL;Dr**\r\nDefensive items are simply inferior to offensive items at the moment. This disbalance needs to be fixed.","replies":[{"poster":"wildfox99","date":"2018-07-02T16:14:48.557+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":14,"body":"defense is not,tank items are\n\ni mean,some defensive items like {{item:3155}} are insanely effective and some offensive items that also give dfensive stats/passives (ie. {{item:3046}} {{item:3812}} {{item:3053}}) make you so tanky when stacked (and against high armor pen they end up being more effective than tanks items)\n\narmor items are fine,we just need to reduce all this true damage and armor pen that makes them useless","replies":[{"poster":"Lets have shrex","date":"2018-07-02T17:28:20.939+0000","up_votes":46,"down_votes":0,"body":"Offensive items shouldn't bring more defensive stats than defensive items {{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}}","replies":[{"poster":"Danjeng","date":"2018-07-02T18:05:28.880+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Imagine if Spear of Shojin was added into the game kek.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bob the Toastr","date":"2018-07-02T18:07:41.575+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"He was going well until the last sentence.

He deals 7.5 damage with the change you came up with.\n\nOnce you are at 50 armor, he deals the same damage has he was previously.    To give you an idea, SONA naturally gets 84.1 Armor by level 18.  \n\nNow just assume that you are against a Darius.  Who gets Triforce, Steraks, Deadmans, Ninja Tabis, Spirit Visage, and Cleaver.  \n\n(we are doing this at level 18). \n\nDarius has 107 Armor and 2282.2 HP.  \nDeadmans gives 60 armor and 425 HP.\nSpirit Visage gives 450 HP and 55 MR.\nNinja Tabi gives 20 Armor.\nCleaver gives 400 HP\nTriforce gives 250 HP\nSteraks gives 450 HP.\n\nSo total Armor is 187 Armor + 4257 HP + 108 MR.  \n\nNow assume Garen builds Cleaver, Deadmans, Steraks, Ninja Tabis, Spirit Visage, and Sunfire.  \n\nThe only thing we will be considering is AD and Armor Shred from Cleaver + his skills, that we being affected.  \n\nWe will assume that Cleaver is max stacked on someone full hp.  (Realistically speaking that can't happen without shields and heals)\n\nGaren shreds 24% of Darius 187 Armor with Cleaver  >>> 142 Armor. No other form of shred is in his kit.\n\nSo now each tick with 1% true damage = 43 damage\n\nWith purposed changes = 27 damage.  \n\nDo you consider Darius a Tank?  Because I consider Darius a bruiser.  This is just a negative change.  He now would lose to every bruiser.  He barely beats/ties them when everything is tied.\n\nSecond change, is also really bad.  He already deals 40% of missing targets HP, and then also deals 10% max damage.  Its counter intuitive.  Assuming it goes through.\n\nLets Use Darius.\n\n4257 HP w/ 108 MR, since his ulti is already magic damage, we will assume you meant magic damage in the change instead of dual damage.\n\nWe will do the point where Garen could execute Darius.  +/- like 1 or 2% for basic errors.\n\nexecute = (426 HP + 40% of missing hp) * 108 MR (reduction)\n\nSo real numbers would be (209 + 19.6% of missing HP + 267.5)  Post reduction.  \n\nSo saying that darius is missing 100% of his hp, Garen would deal 1310 magic damage on ulti.\n\nIt would require Darius to be at 35% HP for Garen to execute him. Where his ulti would deal 876.5 damage.  \n\nTo give you an idea, an ADC, Mage, or Jungle can deal that same number of damage off of two skills.  At 6 items level 18.  (unless they are tank)  \n\nCompare it to literally every other execute in the game.  It would be worthless.\n\nSo no.  We shouldn't do that.  \n\nTL;DR\n\nDarius vs Garen \n\nE damage w/ villain mark down 37% @ 6 items level 18.\n\nR damage w/ villain mark down 25% @ 6 items level 18.  Since Garen can use his ulti at 47% remain HP (True damage)\n\nNot sure if Garen mains would want to lose over 62% damage for a few adjustments.  Just on those two skills, and not calculating basic auto attacks either.  It would be even lower.  :)  Just saying.

I would also give certain items better passives/actives so they're more worth picking up (Like randuins, the \"anti crit\" item, which is pretty out of date considering the new crit meta is built around crits dealing true damage in part. Makes more sense to move randiun's active to FH and give randuins more solid of an identity). \n\nI would also add a few more defensive options, since currently there isn't much diversity (Riot keeps moving tank items into offensive items instead, see GA and Banshees). \n\nI would also make it so tenacity somewhat affected displacements, so that it's worth something again. \n\nI would revert Thornmail's active to deal a percentage like it used to, rather than a terrible scaling flat amount that's almost completely negligable.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lets have shrex","date":"2018-07-02T16:09:07.228+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":8,"body":"\"Tank can tank but deal too much damage ?\"\n\"Hey Rito balance team what should we do ?\"\n\"Idk lol I'm a Yasuo and Yi main\"\n\"Ah ik lol i'll give true damage so armor won't be worth building anymore but tanks will still deal damage\"\n\"holy shit amazing idea\"\n\"leggooooooo boooooooooyzzzz I offer the beers tonight\"\n\nand here's s8 in a nutshell","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pæan","date":"2018-07-02T17:46:47.402+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"Feel free to correct, but isn't that the point? \nIf defense could fully match offense then the tank would take no damage while also dealing its base damage over and over. \n\nThat being said, it's wayyyyyy more skewed than it should be.
