AP and AD ratios differ immensely, considering that EVERY SINGLE MARKSMAN chas access to a 2.5 AD ratio on hit, (and most have access to even more, look at Draven who can pump his all the way up to 3.0, or jinx, etc). OBVIOUSLY AP will be cheaper to build, the average AP ratio hovers around .6 - .7.  \n\nI just can&#039;t wrap my head around the sheer lack of understanding that comes from the statement that &quot;AP items are more efficient than AD ones. If they had said &quot;AP champions are edging out AD champions&quot; or &quot;We&#039;re nerfing AP items because AD items are taking a hit as well,&quot; I&#039;d be fine. But their logic is nonsensical. It&#039;s like them nerfing Health regen items because they are &quot;more efficient&quot; than mana regen. I likewise can&#039;t wrap my head around the fact that somehow, riot thinks this ISNT going to shove ad dominance to a whole new level (where it&#039;s already been something of an issue this season).  Honestly, I&#039;m at a loss. I know the designers are smart, I have no idea why they&#039;d give such a stupid explanation that makes absolutely no sense.\n\n*EDIT: While I appreciate the discussion, the main point of the thread (that being riot's shoddy explanation for the obvious nerfs to ap champs) has largely been unadressed.

By raw calculatons, this favors AD builds.

Yeah, Varus has his Q, but that's also where a lot of his damage budget is, not dissimilar to Nidalee's Spear - but with less follow-up power. \n\nAnd look at a lot of the middle lane roster: you have utility champions that will still nearly kill the shit out of an ADC if they try anything funny ({{champion:61}}, {{champion:127}}, {{champion:99}}, {{champion:117}} {{champion:10}} ), you have people with huge lane control power ({{champion:90}} {{champion:268}} {{champion:4}}), you have champions with enormous burst ({{champion:1}} {{champion:45}} {{champion:7}}), durable champions with high sustain that most ADCs can't force to do anything ({{champion:31}} {{champion:50}} {{champion:8}} ), and you have straight-up assassins which are meant to kill both squishy ADs and squishy APs ({{champion:105}} {{champion:238}} {{champion:91}} {{champion:84}}) \n\nThat's not even counting mid laners that'll likely contribute more to a teamfight even if they do lose the lane. Middle lane is not a friendly place for most ADCs, and the ADCs that can go there and find some success are able to do so because they can fulfill a similar niche as a mage of some kind (namely poke/CC in Varus' case, reminiscent of Xerath). And woe be just about every ADC that wants to go top with its array of anti-ADC gadgetry.\n\nPlus mage champions have had, for a very long time, objectively the best item selection from any role in the game, and that was even before their AP itemization rework, which I think everyone has conveniently forgotten about among all the new toys for AD champions. Their power may not be where it should, I don't know. But you can't look at the most stale role in the game nigh on years and complain that they finally get diversity that other roles have had for about as long as ADCs have been stale. \n\nMost of the ADCs that have high early-game damage _do_ pay for it later in the game. Varus has high early damage, but later he has no reliable AA steroid so his damage falls off - especially if he can't access it via kills or assists. Same for Corki - no reliable AA steroid besides the 10% damage on his passive. That's how they pay for their power - it's locked up behind their abilities, not just their AAs. Say what you will about ADCs like Varus not falling off, but his sustained AA damage is distinctly lacking compared to other ADCs designed more for the late-game.","replies":[{"poster":"Koechophe","date":"2015-11-11T10:05:47.076+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":2,"body":"I'm sorry, but the statement that ANY adc has damage fall off late game is simply ludicrious. Yes, some do more damage late game than others, but damage is never lacking in comparison to MAGES end game.\n\nVarus goes mid into someone like malz, varus will have superior damage all game long. Same can be said of a lot of mid lane matchups. So now, the only reason people pick mid lane champs is if their damage is just stupid broken (see Azir and Viktor and Viegar in competative play) or if they have nasty good zone control through CC and utility (See anivia and Lulu).

Assassins are great in theory, but with PD gutting them pretty badly (12% damage reduction is massive) and then the overlord forcing an additional 12% into bleed damage, and then the new mastery supports take that forces an additional 8% into the support instead of the adc, and then the mercial scimitar getting buffed to the moon, mage assassins are going to become a thing of the past.

ADC will have that same amount of more gold, if not more given the help from the support, plus the starting item that gives extra farming gold, etc. It honestly lends more to adcs getting a bit ahead earlier. Especially since we are likely going to see adcs go mid even more so than we did before with the occasional Varus (I really hope not, but I can easily see some of the changes making some of the adcs very attractive mid).","replies":[{"poster":"The Fast","date":"2015-11-11T16:21:54.850+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So 2 things here:\n\n1.) More gold in the game changes a lot of things. Mainly, time of power spikes. Meaning that if an item got it's price reduced, you can get it faster and spike earlier. So RoA getting its AP increased and price increased is meant to even out the delay in power spike with the more gold present in the game. At the same time, by normalizing common AD starting items, like Botrk, IE, and now Reaver, Riot is affecting when a lot of carries get their power spikes, that is to say they are making ADCs reach their spikes at similar times if they are even. At the same time, the overall price reduction on IE, coupled with increase gold generation, means the ADCs that run IE get that spike faster than they did before, even if the spike is weaker due to it only giving 65 AD.  \n\n**tl:dr: Gold generation increase and item cost increase are meant to shift windows of power, not power levels directly. But you are right in that ADCs get more early game power in this case, at least the caster ADs.**\n\n2.)  Cull vs Doran's should always go in favor of Doran's.
