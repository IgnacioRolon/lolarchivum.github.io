But her ult just feels absolutely horrible, for a lot of reasons.\n\nFor starters, it doesn&#039;t actually add any damage. Her passive comes up every .5 seconds, which means that unless you&#039;re triggering her passive every .5 seconds, dps potential remains the same. Actually hitting all 4 of the points, unless your opponent is either CC&#039;d or a moron, is pretty much impossible, at least without getting yourself killed our out of position, so it&#039;s more like a mord ult, where you pop it and then kill for the effect you get on the enemy death. And the heal is not only almost useless in lane, but in team fights, it makes you feel less like a duelist and more like a janna. I like her new Q (though the targetting seems really off sometimes), I like her new W (though the CD is oppressively long) and I can live with her new E. But her ult is just not good. I don&#039;t care about thematics or whatever, and I'm not saying that we should bring back her old ult, I'm just saying it needs to be changed because it just **feels** absolutely terrible to use.\n\nPossible solutions (not recommending that all be put in at the same time, just things I think might make the ult feel more powerful).\n1) make the heal proactive (I.E. instead of healing all at the end, make it heal 1/4 of the health as an aoe burst every time you knock out a weak spot). This would mean that the ult is useful to you while you're dueling, instead of AFTER you've already dueled. \n2) Add damage to the weak spots so that you ACTUALLY increase your DPS from using your ult \n3) While fiora is within her ult area, her dash range doubles.","replies":[{"poster":"Binxy Prime","date":"2015-08-07T05:31:33.633+0000","up_votes":30,"down_votes":3,"body":"I agree the new ult is by far the least rewarding portion of her kit.

Hitting both a vital and another AA in a 1.5 second period is LITERALLY impossible at level 1 because you only have .672 attack speed which means that you'd have .00008 seconds to get to her vital and then attack. It's not possible to orb walk around a champion in .00008 seconds, nor is reaction time that fast humanly possible.\n\nBut even if you did do two attacks, here's the damage calculations.\n\nLvl 1 fiora has 60 AD, adding the dorean's blade and masteries/runes, we'll call it 75, so she does 75 damage  per attack = 150 base damage. Added to that she'll do ~ 4% of riven's max health in true damage, and 90 magic damage from her riposte\n\nRiven has a base of 560 hp and has a base 25 armor and 31 MR. Assuming she's a competant player and has decent runes/masteries, she'd have +10 armor and +12 MR, for a total of 35 armor and 41 mr.\n\nSo, the true damage would deal 22 damage (560 X .04 = 22.4)\nThe AD would deal 110 damage (150 X 100/135)\nThe Magic damage would deal 62 damage (90 X 100/141)\n\nFor a grand total of 194 damage. Riven has 560 BASE health, and probably more from runes and masteries. And, considering that it's only realistic for you to be doing 1 attack, not two, your net damage is closer to 139 (same math with one attack removed)\n\nSo the answer is no.
