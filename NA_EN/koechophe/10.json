My placements went well, I mained bard, and in 5/10 of my games was at least S ranked (not that it seems like it&#039;s a very accurate determination). I went 7/3, and was pretty happy with that, until I saw that I was placed almost an entire division below where I ended last season. \n\nBut that&#039;s not the frustrating part. I was g5 last season. One of my in-game friends was g5 as well, and he went a whopping 1/9 in placements (it was sad). And do you know where he ended up? S4, just like me. The placement matches that I stressed over doing well in meant literally nothing. If I would&#039;ve just started in my tier, 7 wins (6 in a row) could&#039;ve easily gotten me tiered up or at least a few steps closer. I legit have no idea why there&#039;s placement matches if you&#039;re just going to be placed completely regardless of them. \n\nRiot, either make placements actually mean something, or just remove them next season. There&#039;s no reason to have the stress at trying to place well if placements themselves don&#039;t affect you whatsoever. \n\n**Edit:** I don't really care that I was placed so much lower; I'm just frustrated that my placement matches, in which I actually feel I did really well, had 0 bearing on my actual placement. They need to either actually effect you (even if it's just 1-2 divisions) or be removed so you don't waste time and stress on them.
