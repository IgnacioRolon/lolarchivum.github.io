They invalidate an entire class of characters and are completely oppressive with this item. I know you guys don&#039;t balance ARAM, but you at least should try to keep it fun, because it&#039;s the second most popular game mode. Playing against a warmongs tank in this mode is NOT fun.","replies":[{"poster":"Goodest Gamer","date":"2015-09-04T01:00:22.880+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"ur sad melees and chamsp that had no ranged poke can survive your poke a little easier? yea that sucks buddy.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MisterHealYoGirl","date":"2015-09-03T21:19:37.924+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"To be fair, before it, poke completely invalidated tanks.

If a tank wants to constantly heal up and be unable to spend gold to become stronger, fine by me, just ignore them and focus other champions.\n\nAnd no, poke champions are the most unfun champions to play against it. Sorry you have to think about your position in ARAM to not get hit by snowballs, its really not difficult to dodge them, snowballs have allowed for melee dominant champions to go from be trash tier in this game mode to actually somewhat viable.\n\nAnd the funny thing about all this? Poke champions are still S-tier champions in ARAM despite snowballs and Warmogs introduction. Sorry you can't immediately say GG when you roll a Lux,, Varus, or a Nidalee, or a Sona, but whether or not you  want to acknowledge it, its for the better health of ARAM. You actually have to put a little effort into using these characters now! *Gasps!* \n\n> [{quoted}](name=Jesuszilla,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=OUMRy4jm,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-09-24T07:12:45.211+0000)\n>\n> The answer to poke on aram is not to make an item that turns a champion into a walking fountain.  Warmogs as it is now is broken on aram and needs to be removed or nerf for this game mode.  You think that it only gives a champion some regen to survive poke.  In actuality what it does is give a tank the ability to turret dive for some harass, then run away and health all the way up to full in ~15 seconds, then do it again.  Meanwhile no one else can heal just by standing around.  This type of item is completely detrimental to the game.  Poke is strong on aram?  Guess what, THAT'S HOW THE GAME MODE WORKS.\n\nI don't get your point here, you completely acknowledge that poke is the strongest tool in ARAM, and you want to keep it that way for reasons being, that's how the game mode works?\n\nGonna have to disagree here, poke needs to not be so dominant, there are some games where you look at the loading screen, and you can say yup, we're about to get our ass kicked. \n\nWhich is fine in of itself, but when that mode of thinking is connected to predominantly to one style of game play, which in this case are poke champions, there's a serious problem here. \n\nNever once have I looked at a loading screen with champions who can use warmogs/snowballs effectively and think to myself, shit, I'm fucked. \n\nAlso, that 15 second window where he has to run away and heal up? That's more then enough time to push your extra man advantage or 4v4 against them if you're smart. 15 seconds is a lot of time in LoL to make things happen.
