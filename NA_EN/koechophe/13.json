This is a flat buff to AD ezreal (they added a 60% AD ratio to his W), so why is AP ezreal getting ninja-nerfed? Riot promised to preserve the playstyle in the rework, it looks like they're killing something that's already dying.","replies":[{"poster":"Saezio","date":"2018-09-27T21:45:23.457+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because somehow they can't just make 1 tear item purchaseable and they scared people will go double tear again is my best guess.\nWish they reworked him into an ap mage instead of gutting it and making him viable only as AD once again","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bârd","date":"2018-09-28T19:12:39.989+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because the new W makes AP Ezreal a lot better at pushing, the new W is faster and has longer range than the current one, he now has some mana sustain, and E prioritizing the W target makes it a much more reliable damage soruce.\n\nHe's trading raw damage output for utility.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LeftyRaydy","date":"2018-09-27T21:58:37.729+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ugh, I did some math and brought some different Ideas for many posts regarding the new Ezreal. I am acutally really excited to see him on the rift with his new W. He may be a healthier AP EZ then ever before. I will share this post below. Also I do not understand 1 thing, why does he have to be AP mid, I mean he could be hybrid or AD mid with this new ability. you will see what I mean below.\n\n\nDude you are too focused on the \"AP\" part of Ezreal. AP Ezreal will still be viable, but what you are not looking at is hybrid or Double tear Ezreal will be absolutely disgusting. I am even thinking it would be broken strong and will have to be tuned down. with his New W he gets mana sustain, and high single target damage just thinking putting the numbers alone here lets look.\n\nOld EZ Lvl 18 with just Lich Bane\nATTACK DAMAGE 102.5\nLich Bane - 80 AP - 75% base AD + 50% AP (76.875 + 40) 116.875 damage\nOLD W rank 5 - (250 + 80% AP) (250 + 64) 314 damage\nQ Rank 5 - 115 + 110% total AD + 40% AP (115 + 112.75 + 32) 259.75\n\nTotal combo - 116.875 + 314 +259.75 = 690.625\n\nNew EZ Lvl 18 with just Lich Bane\nATTACK DAMAGE 102.5\nLich Bane - 80 AP - 75% base AD + 50% AP (76.875 + 40) 116.875 damage\nNew W rank 5 - (255 + 60% bonus AD + 40% AP) (255 + 32) 287 damage\nQ Rank 5 - 115 + 110% total AD + 40% AP (115 + 112.75 + 32) 259.75\n\nTotal combo (Q damage + Lich bane and W proc) - 116.875 + 287 +259.75 = 658.625 damage\n\nNow looking at this with 80 AP with the Lich bane you only lose 32 Damage. What you haven't though about was how much better his lane will be. He gets a refund on mana, and now AP Ezreal scales really well with Gun blade I want you to look at this. This would Make AP ezreal able to sustain in lane no problems.\n\nOld EZ Lvl 18 with just Gun blade\nBase ATTACK DAMAGE 102.5\nGun blade + 40 AD and 80 AP\nTotal AD 142.5\nTotal AP: 80\nOLD W rank 5 - (250 + 80% AP) (250 + 64) 314 damage\nQ Rank 5 - 115 + 110% total AD + 40% AP (115 + 156.75 + 32) 303.75\n\nTotal combo - 314 +303.75 = 617.75\n\nNew EZ Lvl 18 with just Gun blade\nBase ATTACK DAMAGE 102.5\nGun blade + 40 AD and 80 AP\nTotal AD 142.5\nTotal AP: 80\nNew W rank 5 - (255 + 60% bonus AD + 40% AP) (255 + 24 + 32) 311 damage\nQ Rank 5 - 115 + 110% total AD + 40% AP (115 + 156.75 + 32) 303.75\n\nTotal combo - 311 + 303.75 = 614.75\n\nThat is a total loss of 3 Damage from 1 combo, and you now have passive sustain from W for mana and heal for all damage dealt.\n\nFor AP ez I would recommend\nStarting either  + or  or  or \nWith mana not being as much of a concern as there was no mana refunds on EZ's you can build much differently\nI would go with either  or  (I wonder if Luden's Echo Passive procs new Ezreal W)\nFull build I would think\n     \n\nAlthough This Build would probably be disgusting for AP ezreal for straight damage with the AD and AP scalings.","replies":[{"poster":"Koechophe","date":"2018-09-27T22:34:48.527+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Let me throw some math at you that uses more than just 80 ap.\n\nEzreal loses 20% ap in his combo (10% shaved off of his Q and 10% shaved off of his W). \nAt 200 ap it results in a net loss of 40 damage\nAt 400 ap it results in a net loss of 80 damage\nAt 800 ap it results in a net loss of 160 damage\n\nBut wait, there's more\n-In team fights, ezreal is landing more than 1 q, period. Assuming that, he's losing 10% ap damage on every single one.\n-Ap ezreals who were even remotely worth their salt would hit W on multiple targets. Turning it into a single-target spell loses a LOT of potential damage (assuming you're hitting 2-3 targets with it, it's losing 250-500 +90%-170% ap). \n\nThis is a tremendous buff to hybrid, yes. If hybrid is going to be oppressive, please, for the love of all that's holy, TONE DOWN THE AD RATIOS INSTEAD. They're adding an AD ratio, and then nerfing the AP ratios to compensate.
