I know she's seeing quite a bit of success in both solo queue and competitive play at the minute, which is great, but a lot of us Quinn players across the board agree that she's kinda lacking in the fun department compared to our old Quinn.\n\nSo, before her rework, her ultimate gave her SO many options and opportunities: she could use it for roaming, ganking, assassinating, or repositioning. Now, it's just a pure mobility tool which doesn't even feel good to use a lot of the time due to the long channel and how easy it is for it to be canceled. Not to mention the ult simply isn't as fun to use anymore compared to the old one. \n\nSee, Quinn technically had 2 kits before, her own and Valor's. Even if Valor's abilities were just melee versions of Quinn's, they were fun to use and added variety and versatility to her kit because you had many ways to pull them off! Now we've just been left with Quinn's kit, but souped up, and an ultimate that you just kinda spam whenever you know you're gonna be walking for a while, whereas Tag Team actually had a meaningful cooldown tied to it to make sure you'd use it for wise plays around the map or in your lane! (Not saying her current ult can't be used wisely too, I'm just saying the cooldown [or lack thereof] makes it so that she doesn't need to plan ahead all of the time.)\n\nI also think the new ultimate took away a lot Quinn's original flavor/thematic and gameplay identity (namely, the dual Champion thematic). The swap out/transformation with Valor made sense because he's supposed to be Quinn's fighting equal. He even had his own portrait that would show up on the screen and minimap during Tag Team! Quinn and Valor were THE 2-in-1 Champions. But now since we can't play him or use him in combat anymore, it feels like he's been relegated to Tibbers status, where he's more of just a 'pet'. It doesn't feel like we're doing justice to Quinn and Valor, now it's mostly just Quinn even though they're supposed to be a dynamic duo!\n\nAnyway, sorry for the long post, I just wanna hear your thoughts on this and if you think there will ever be a chance for Valor to return as a playable character again. I've tried to get conversations going with Rioters about Quinn and Valor for a while now so if you have time to talk, I'd really appreciate it :) \n\nThanks and cheers!","replies":[{"poster":"Reav3","date":"2016-03-14T17:41:41.430+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":3,"body":"Hi Valor Bot!\n\nThanks for the well thought out post!\n\nFirst let me say that I am not a designer, for design questions it would be best to ask Riot Repertoir (the designer on the Quinn update), Statikk (the lead designer of the champion update team), or Meddler (the lead designer of core gameplay.)\n\nIn fact, RR answered many questions about Quinn in a post awhile back you should check out\n\n[](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/ll6gkAek-heres-a-post-where-you-can-ask-questions-about-the-stuff-ive-worked-on-and-ill-try-to-answer)\n\nThat being said I can try to answer you questions from my perspective as the product manager of the champion update team.\n\nTo provide some context, as the product manager, my primary responsibility is to provide the high level strategy for the team (What we work on and how many resources we dedicate to those things), and to create the high level product goals for what we work on.\n\nSo below are the three initiatives we currently have on the Champion Update team as well as what there product goals are.\n\n**VGU Initiative **\n\nProduct Goal: Bring champions that are below current Riot standards for Design, Art, and Narrative up to the same level as a new champion. (Essentially creating a new champion with the core essence of the old champion.)\n\n**Roster Initiative **\n\nProduct Goal: Look at a entire class or sub-class and define the classes Strengths & Weaknesses. Push the champions in that class or sub-class that have overlapping strategic identities into a more clear, distinct strategic identity. \n\n**Skin Splash Rework Initiative **\n\nProduct Goal: Update current VGU's skin splash art and champions that have had VUs in the past to match there new model and are up to Riot's current Splash Art Standards.\n\nOk, now that I have provided the context I will try and answer your questions the best I can.\n\n> What are your thoughts on Quinn currently? \n\nWhile I won't comment on her design I can comment on how well she hit the roster projects product goals.  In that regard, I think Quinn was a very successful roster project. While we didn't give her a new strategic identity, we did push her old strategic identity (Markmen with a lot of mobility) much further, which resulted in a much clearer strategic identity. There are now clear reasons to pick Quinn (one being that she is really good against champions that want to split push, and she works really well with comps that want to skirmish a lot.)\n\n> Anyway, sorry for the long post, I just wanna hear your thoughts on this and if you think there will ever be a chance for Valor to return as a playable character again.\n\nQuinn most likely won't be in a roster project anytime soon, and she's not really in need of a full VGU anytime soon either. I wouldn't say we will never do a bigger update to her that brings back Valor, it just isn't on the horizon anytime soon. If we got to the point a couple years down the line where it looked like Quinn was in need of a VGU there's always the possibility of Valor coming back.","replies":[{"poster":"Árchangel Avacyn","date":"2016-03-14T20:30:12.592+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":">  While we didn't give her a new strategic identity, we did push her old strategic identity (Markmen with a lot of mobility) much further, which resulted in a much clearer strategic identity. \n\nI really have to step in and question the accuracy of this statement, there seems to be quite a lot of issue with Riot and how they perceive champion's roles and themes which I was hoping you'd have learned from the mess that was the Mordekaiser update. Quinn was not a 'Marksman with a lot of mobility' and no one who played her consistently would agree with that, removing her most mechanically interesting ability and perhaps the one that personified her theme the most is not 'pushing her old strategic identity' in the slightest. It's true that roaming was extremely common on Quinn, you'd be a fool not to with an ult like that but mobility wasn't a significant part of her identity any more than it would be for the likes of Tahm Kench, it was a tool you had access to but not a core element of her kit that needed expanding on. \n\nWhat's most telling is that in the year leading up to the update there was several concerted efforts to help you guys understand what it was that we liked about Quinn and her playstyle and at no point did anyone ever suggest 'Valor should do less stuff' because the idea of removing Valor as a combat unit(even the most radical suggestions were aimed at making him function as a summon-able unit like Tibbers and Wolf) runs completely counter to everything the champion was supposed to be about, a team.\n\nIf your claim is that the rework made Quinn stronger and more viable in competitive play then I will agree with you, that's true. The real question that needs to be answered though is: Was removing great chunks of her mechanical interactions, theme and feel an appropriate price for the power gained? I don't think so, Mordekaiser players didn't think so when he became FOTM after his rework but lost a lot of his charm too. \n\nI understand that you are not the person to talk to about this but getting a hold of Rep is very hard lately(I assume due to the Taric Update/MYMU), I don't want you to think that I'm angry at you specifically but I am very frustrated with the situation we are in right now. My favourite champion feels so much less fun and simpler and everyone expects you to be happy about it because 'she's stronger' or just flame you for 'playing some cancer champion' in all my years of playing a champion considered trash by most people I've never received as much abuse for picking her as I have in the few months she's been strong and I'd just like to know that Riot at least acknowledges what was lost to achieve that goal.\n\nThanks for your time, Reav3.","replies":[{"poster":"Reav3","date":"2016-03-14T20:53:19.654+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey Quinn and Valet,\n\nSorry you feel that way.
