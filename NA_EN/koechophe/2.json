Not only is the tooltip inaccurate, I tested the damage changes through minions and the healing changes through calculation, neither are in place yet.\n\nAny indication of when these are actually going to happen?\n\n*EDIT: I can confirm that Darius, at least, has now been changed.

Skarner and Darius Q base dmg changes went live, but the healing is still 10% of your missing HP. Tested it with ~1k missing HP and hitting one champ. Did get 107 HP back.\n\nTested on EUW.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SkarSkarSkarner","date":"2015-08-26T07:24:00.211+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=OyqL0QXB,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2015-08-26T07:11:28.014+0000)\n>\n> The Darius/Skarner hotfix will get to NA a little bit later than it does other regions (such as Oceania as you've linked there).

They updated the patch notes, but Skarner hasn't been nerfed.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Yosuke Apperu","date":"2015-08-26T05:02:25.856+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Darius is getting buffed on pbe tho xD","replies":[{"poster":"Koechophe","date":"2015-08-26T05:16:00.766+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"That has nothing to do with riot releasing patch notes saying he's hotfixed when, in reality, he isn't.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"The Loveless","date":"2015-08-26T05:27:16.100+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"he was fine tho, they're gonna overtune him like they did Ryze","replies":[]},{"poster":"Apex Dunamis","date":"2015-08-26T18:51:39.862+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I still have not seen anything in the patch notes either, also! where is my {{champion:122}}  academy skin already?!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dormidon","date":"2015-08-26T06:26:22.148+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"His Q damage already got hotfixed.
