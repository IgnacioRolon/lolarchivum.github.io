I&#039;ve been playing a lot of Bard, and I&#039;ve always loved his playstyle. When I started, I tried to play hyper-agressive in lane, but it never worked out very well because his poke was abysmal. So instead I transitioned into leveling W first and never getting hit, so I could just sustain away any damage they did to the ADC with my shrines, and smoothly transition into Bard&#039;s awesome mid-late game skirmish plays. \r\n\r\nWith the new season, I decided to try agressive Bard again, where I run MPen runes, and I went into thunderlord&#039;s because I noticed that spells with an on hit (like his meeps) proc it twice, so a Q + AA combo will do the thunderlord effect. And I suddenly found myself chunking the ADC or the support for 1/2 of their hp. I have no real explanation for this. I know thunderlord&#039;s helps, but man, bard&#039;s damage seems to have magically shot through the roof in the new season. \r\n\r\nI used to run tanky builds with things like Frozen heart, spirit visage, Dead man&#039;s plate, etc. But now, after the core sighstone item, I run ludens into lichbane into situational (usually zonyas or void) and I find myself doing absurd amounts of damage for a support. Even when Bard gets behind, he&#039;s got enough utility to fall back on, and almost magically, he seems to get ahead again. My last game I was doing terrible in lane, went 1/4/2, and then we had a skirmish in the jungle, I nabbed three kills, then went on a massive killing spree until I was up to 8 (I wasn&#039;t ksing even, just blowing people up). I ended that game 10/8/18 with more damage than everyone except our mid laner. \r\n\r\nIdc what it is, but bard is amazing now.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Koalifier","date":"2015-11-20T23:38:24.392+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"IMO he's just really great with Thunderlord's since it procs from Q-Auto+Meep alone, which makes his early laning that much more oppressive. \n\nTo be fair, I think he was already strong pre-preseason, and Thunderlord's just amped up his power. That and Kalista being played less helps (she's too hard to hit for him with Q). \n\nBard also thrives in the early game when he hits level 9 because he has maxed out his Q, but begins to fall off in damage and overall impact once other champs start building health/resists instead of damage. Since early game pressure is more valuable with squishier towers and Rift Herald, Bard gets better :D","replies":[{"poster":"RedCyclone","date":"2015-11-21T07:45:08.436+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Question, if Bard can do this then why can't Sona considering when she uses Q with a passive auto attack she has FOUR sources of damage coming off her, but I can only get it to proc if I autoattack reset with the passive early...\nA friend told me in PBE that it proced of her Q+passive, needless to say I was pretty stumped to find out that it didn't on live\n\nI have a feeling that Thunderlords and Deathfire are pretty bugged on what they consider as \"abilities\"","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Koalifier","date":"2015-11-21T09:14:51.231+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RedCyclone,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=UoZZFNMl,comment-id=00040002,timestamp=2015-11-21T07:45:08.436+0000)\n>\n> Question, if Bard can do this then why can't Sona considering when she uses Q with a passive auto attack she has FOUR sources of damage coming off her, but I can only get it to proc if I autoattack reset with the passive early...\n> A friend told me in PBE that it proced of her Q+passive, needless to say I was pretty stumped to find out that it didn't on live\n> \n> I have a feeling that Thunderlords and Deathfire are pretty bugged on what they consider as \"abilities\"\n\nSo with Sona, her passive makes her next auto \"empowered\" with her last chord effect, so it modifies her auto attack. With Bard, his meeps add an additional effect to his normal autos, the meep-strike. Bard's autoattack and his meep damage are two separate instances of damage, which is why Bard meep-auto + Q = 3 autoattacks or abilities - which is the trigger for thunderlord's.","replies":[{"poster":"Academy Kayn","date":"2015-11-21T10:59:57.923+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Petition to change the in-game name of his passive to \"The Meep-Stike\"","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Koalifier","date":"2015-11-21T19:20:13.664+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Light24o1,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=UoZZFNMl,comment-id=0004000200000001,timestamp=2015-11-21T10:59:57.923+0000)\n>\n> Petition to change the in-game name of his passive to \"The Meep-Stike\"\n\n+1","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"RedCyclone","date":"2015-11-21T15:39:07.810+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the reply, but don't take this post as an attack or anything, im just confused\n\nSo essentially the empowered autoattack bard gets \"doesn't count\" as an empowered auto even though it is\n\nSounds pretty fair...\nAlso WHY don't empowered auto's count towards Thunderlords and Deathfire? are they not abilities/auto attacks like the masteries say they proc for?\nIt's very confusing for people to actually figure out what counts for these masteries to work it, and it's really inconsistent, there is a list somewhere on reddit where half of the champions in the games damage passives don't even proc them....","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Koalifier","date":"2015-11-21T19:19:21.883+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RedCyclone,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=UoZZFNMl,comment-id=0004000200000002,timestamp=2015-11-21T15:39:07.810+0000)\n>\n> Thanks for the reply, but don't take this post as an attack or anything, im just confused\n> \n> So essentially the empowered autoattack bard gets \"doesn't count\" as an empowered auto even though it is\n> \n> Sounds pretty fair...\n> Also WHY don't empowered auto's count towards Thunderlords and Deathfire? are they not abilities/auto attacks like the masteries say they proc for?\n> It's very confusing for people to actually figure out what counts for these masteries to work it, and it's really inconsistent, there is a list somewhere on reddit where half of the champions in the games damage passives don't even proc them....\n\nHmmmm, as far as I know, the easiest way to tell whether something will count as a \"point\" toward thunderlord's proc is to see how many times you're going to deal damage to the opponent. Sona's empowered auto does damage once, so it's one \"point\". Bard's passive does damage twice, once for the auto, and again for the meep. It works like that because the Meep later becomes AOE, so the meep damage needs to be separate from the auto damage (well, maybe it doesn't need to be that way, but it's much simpler). So basically each time an ability makes little damage floaty numbers come up, it probably adds a stack of thunderlord's.\n\nAs far as figuring out what works for the masteries, I don't really think the opportunity cost of \"play a game with it and pay attention to when it procs\" is really that rough :/","replies":[{"poster":"FromTXwithLove","date":"2015-11-22T04:41:55.049+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nami, if she selfcasts her E, has two damage proc numbers when hitting an enemy champion.

Also, if they're just playing AP in general and prefer to damage from the support role instead of use utility.
