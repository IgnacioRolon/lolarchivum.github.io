There's no punishment for a wrong answer because there is no wrong answer. Use it as an initiate? That works. Use it to cleanse a slow after the fight starts? That works too. A good Eve has built Rylai's, so having to use her speed boost to stick to an opponent is a choice you have already eliminated because of an itemization decision. By adding a resource to spend in order to make that choice, even if it is just 40 mana, you implement a risk/reward to the choice and punishable if you make the poor decision.

We don't make changes driven purely by statistics (we aim for data informed, not data driven's). Eve's certainly right up there in terms of raw win rate though, with from memory the 4th or 5th highest winrate in the game at present when comparing champions as played by people with substantial experience on them. Eve's got a pretty steep mastery curve, so if her overall performance looks average it often means that her performance when played well is excessive even for someone on a champion they've played a lot (a phenomena also strongly demonstrated by other champs like Azir and Le Blanc who, if they're showing a 50% win rate in solo queue, are almost certainly very overpowered).\n\nso what your saying is Eve is still overpowered cause she can gank early game so u added a mana cost to gate her into loosing her early game by forcing runeglaive instead of giving her jungle item diversity cause lets face it without blue if u dont go runeglaive u still can mana dump fast which was a risk eve players took when buying warrior or any other jungle item as it stands. now by forcing runeglaive and killing her earlier game dmg more; forcing runeglaive more or less forces her into an Ap only build or runeglaive's scale is pointless and the proc becomes useless. in turn the nerf lowers eves early dmg potential but it limits her jungle itemization and diversity (something u guys praised at one point). youalso limit her own build paths and diversity by forcing runeglaive on her and kill her early and mid game imo making her now useless during all times of the game. when compared to jungle champ options eve will now no longer be an option in any situation. and as most will agree you guys have been doing this back and forth with evelyn since beta. just admit you dont want her in the game and either delete her or pls just leave her alone. even this small nerf has got people who hate eve as much as they hate teemo complaining cause they are just as confused and annoyed that once again we are doing the eve run around.","replies":[{"poster":"TotN Titan","date":"2015-10-01T09:48:29.758+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=NostolgicSkies,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=bKd1UWQl,comment-id=00030006,timestamp=2015-10-01T09:04:56.544+0000)\n>\n> so what your saying is Eve is still overpowered cause she can gank early game so u added a mana cost to gate her into loosing her early game by forcing runeglaive instead of giving her jungle item diversity cause lets face it without blue if u dont go runeglaive u still can mana dump fast which was a risk eve players took when buying warrior or any other jungle item as it stands. now by forcing runeglaive and killing her earlier game dmg more; forcing runeglaive more or less forces her into an Ap only build or runeglaive's scale is pointless and the proc becomes useless. in turn the nerf lowers eves early dmg potential but it limits her jungle itemization and diversity (something u guys praised at one point). youalso limit her own build paths and diversity by forcing runeglaive on her and kill her early and mid game imo making her now useless during all times of the game. when compared to jungle champ options eve will now no longer be an option in any situation. and as most will agree you guys have been doing this back and forth with evelyn since beta. just admit you dont want her in the game and either delete her or pls just leave her alone. even this small nerf has got people who hate eve as much as they hate teemo complaining cause they are just as confused and annoyed that once again we are doing the eve run around.\n\nYou may have secretly found a perfect answer. If Evelyn is allowed to go with another enchantment as her jungle item instead of using runeglaive, then the purpose for the item to exist is narrowed to an even smaller pool. There are already only a handful of junglers that use runeglaive and if Evelyn is building a more AD or tanky alternative, it would make the list even smaller.","replies":[{"poster":"NostolgicSkies","date":"2015-10-01T09:53:19.768+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=TotN Titan,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=bKd1UWQl,comment-id=000300060000,timestamp=2015-10-01T09:48:29.758+0000)\n>\n> You may have secretly found a perfect answer.

There are still working Warrior, Cinderhulk and even Devourer builds.\n\nI am one of the players who mastered Eve. I don't know how my stats affected your calculations of Evelynn's winrate, but as an avid Evelynn player, I can tell you that what I find too strong about her kit. It is her E. And the problem is not the base damage, the problem is that it deals too much damage when you actually have items. It has 1.0/1.0 scaling and procs on-hit effects while being a point and click ability that has no counterplay except not being in range. I would feel okay if it was a skill shot. Or even if it was split into 2 usable charges (it is already essentially 2 hits, right?) like the old Fiora's Q.","replies":[{"poster":"TotalJerk","date":"2015-10-01T15:00:19.369+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=mirAcIe,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=bKd1UWQl,comment-id=00030008,timestamp=2015-10-01T09:41:43.147+0000)\n>\n> Besides, not everyone even builds Runeglaive on Evelynn.
