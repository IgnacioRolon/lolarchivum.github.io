Now, I don&#039;t want to talk about whether AD MF needs nerfs. That&#039;s not the issue. I just want to point out the fact that in her rework, riot specifically mentioned that they took pains to make sure that AP was preserved. I know it doesn&#039;t seem like much, but the AP playstyle is fun and rewarding. If you don&#039;t believe me, try it; it feels very different from AD MF, and is extremely fun to play. This nerf absolutely slaughters the AP playstyle, hurting it WAY more than it hurts the AD playstyle. There are an infinite number of ways you could avoid this (Nerf Love Tap instead, nerf the AD ratio on her ult, increase the AP ratio on her Q and E to compensate, nerf her attack speed on her W instead, etc). Please, give at least a smidgen of thought to the AP playstyle before you gut it in a nerf that&#039;s barely going to affact AD miss fortune (people will just level W first instead, E damage was pretty negligable by end game anyway).\n\n*Edit: Wow, the community is feeling toxic  tonight.

Miss Fortune needs a nerf, yes, but... She needs the range on Make It Rain reduced back to 800 (they buffed it to 1000 when preseason started)\n\n That, and they need to revert the windup reduction they gave Bullet Time. Currently it casts instantly, which was healthy before when Bullet Time wasn't that powerful to begin with. Now, it's a catastrophe to enemy teams. The damage is devastating, the length, the width, which is all fine because it's a ***3*** second channel that cannot be redirected, can be interrupted and dodged. But, with the windup time basically gone, enemy teams have minimal time to react to it, especially when a long ranged Make It Rain is dropped on the enemy team.\n\nTL;DR - Revert the buff to Make It Rain's range, and revert the buff to the ***significant*** reduction of Bullet Time's windup time, making it cast immediately.","replies":[{"poster":"Superior Current","date":"2016-01-07T08:21:41.524+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree that they shouldn't nerf the damage. Maybe back to 900 range will be okay for Make it rain. It was buffed because it was hard to pull off a good E+R combo. But now it lacks counterplay if you're AP MF or even AD if you max it first.  An alternative is to increase the mana cost of Make it rain to 100, which will force MF's to think twice before they use it. \n\n\nAs for the ultimate, a wind time for a 3 second long channel is unnecessary IMO, just try to step out of it or end the channel.
