And more than that; _**the mute button does not change the rules you agreed to upon creating your account.**_ The rules are \"don't flame or be toxic in chat\", not \"don't flame or be toxic in chat unless the mute feature exists\".\n\n> Running it down lane, inting, or afking should be punishable by account suspension.\n\nFirstly, this is already the case, and secondly, as Jamaree mentioned, infinitely escalating Chat Restrictions used to be a thing, and only resulted in players under longer-duration chat restrictions resorting to trolling and intentionally feeding.\n\nAnd, yeah, I already know the incoming counterargument; \"so just ban them when they do feed\". It's not that simple, as troll/feeder detection is still far from great, and on top of that, _you are essentially **welcoming** an uptick of intentional feeders and trolls in exchange for more lax punishments on chat toxicity._","replies":[]},{"poster":"rujitra","date":"2019-03-21T03:48:43.420+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"Shooting at someone should only be punishable by having your gun taken away.
