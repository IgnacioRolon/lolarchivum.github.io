I tried to get into 4 games but I couldn't because of this, and I don't what do!! I even had a perfect record before this happened to me where I have to wait 5 mins. to join a queue right now, which is absolutely crazy... I can't do knowing right now since I don't know how to handle this problem. Please Help! I want to enjoy the game like I did before this happened to me which basically ruined the fun. I've been trying to search for ways to fix it, on youtube, and on the LoL forums but I still hadn't found a solution yet :( I need someones help A.S.A.P. because at this point it is getting frustrating! I don't want to risk my account getting banned! I also tried to troubleshoot - nothing, and also restart my computer - nothing.  Additionally, can it be fixed by deleting the launcher, and re-downloading it, would that fix it? So it would be awesome if someone can help me, and hopefully this problem can be resolved in no time! Thanks for taking your time out of your precious lives to save me &lt;3","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-10T22:10:17.349+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It looks like your network is unable to make a connection to the game server.
