There are key locations you can put it in, but the end result is, it won't stay there all game and for the most part if it shows someone stealthed once, it will be taken out pretty quickly afterward. The Cd on sweepers is decent, not the best, and it only gets you so far. It isn't always going to be available to be used and you have to be psychic to be able to use it at the right time to reveal the stealthed person. Akali is easy to use it on and so is Eve, but for stealth champs like Teemo and Twitch, it's pretty much based on luck if you find them, esp Teemo since he can set himself up in a bush long before you even walk by. Twitch dominates with stealth early because scanner can't be upgraded until lvl 9 (not saying Twitch is strong or he wins lane, saying his stealth is almost impossible to reveal early without a vision ready to place when he does) Oracles was much more reliable. It lasted longer than the small amount of the same effect after sweeper's use and it was a constant presence for 4 minutes. You can't say that sweeper's is better than it simply because of that upgraded version. 10 seconds of the ability to see invis traps and champs isn't better than 4 minutes of the same ability. The cost was worth it in the long run, esp since you didn't have to wait for CD to be able to use it for traps and the like.

MAx 5 pink wards on map but this champs stealths are either only when not in combat(eve) or on a low as shit cd (twitch and shaco) i can only drop 1 damn ward in the game if they are smart enough not to kill it. Probally not the same in high elo but in bronze/ silver it sounds dumb but cause no one wards much less buys pinks. Pink wards are not an effective strat against stealth. Stealth itself offers very damn little counterplay so im on the remove all stealth champs from the game period end of disscussion.","replies":[{"poster":"DezeMuffins","date":"2015-10-07T21:37:09.114+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can place another pink if you have one up, the original just disappears ...","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"NineTailedMystic","date":"2015-10-07T09:26:54.641+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Then the stealth champion finds the pink ward, leaves it, and goes the other way around, knowing you can only have 1 pink out.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sire Hippington","date":"2015-10-07T16:18:27.071+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think for starters, we need to remove stuff that detects invisible champions.\nInvis detection is a 100% hardcounter, it removes it completly.\nIt's the same problem as GW and heavy healing champs, it is really hard to balance around a hard counter, as either the mechanic is way to powerfull if not countered(pup-stomping akali), or it's somewhat fair if not countered but totally usless once countered....\n\nWith hardcounters removed, you could more easily balance around stealth, especially short-duratio/area-dependend as a defensive tool.\nThis obvously has to come with balance changes for all current stealth users, as it's a buff for them.\n\nIf you leave stealth-detection vs champs in the game, you always have to balance with worst and best case in mind, beeing the differnce between haveing stealth, or not haveing stealth, which is pretty much bound to fail one way or another.\n\nAnd for long-duration stealth like twitch, i think the eve.passive is a good example on how to get that done in a more interesting way.","replies":[{"poster":"Baunjo","date":"2015-10-07T18:42:17.972+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"You cannot say \" Let's remove stealth detection \" and not actually give a substitute.

Her stealth isn't \"permanent\" it is depended on combat and while she is clearing she is not stealthed. I know and agree that this is a pain and a at low levels considered a waste of gold but seriously you should do this with every jungler. I also have to say I completely agree that stealth needs to be dealt with either through proper balancing, riot actually releasing Mandrake Ward (You'll always live on in my heart) or some other method I am not thinking of. But a pink ward and using it on the primary method of ganking is the primary way to deal with eve then putting deep wards in her jungle will reveal her clear route and general position.

Twitch is fine right now, imo. Rengar and Kha'zix are really good examples of stealth champs that can be played competitively because their entire kits aren't based on stealth. Any champ that has the majority of their kit based on stealth isn't going to do well competitively because it's so easy to shut them down. 250 gold and some pink wards is all it takes, and pros consistently have 5 pink wards out at all times.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LightH0use","date":"2015-10-06T16:09:02.912+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"There is no way to make a \"balanced\" stealth.
