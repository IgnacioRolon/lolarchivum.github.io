This is a smurf account that I used to do these tests. Last season, I blatantly trolled over 250 ranked games to bronze 5 0lp, but made sure I was nice about it. Every team knew I was trolling, and most probably reported me. Literally zero punishment. \n\nI posted on the boards that I had done so, and of course I was downvoted and called a liar. Because when evidence doesn't match your opinions, you have to dismiss it. Here's that post: \n\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/g047OoEn-undeniable-proof-that-trolls-do-not-get-banned?\n\nI want to stress that I would have my team foaming at the mouth in anger at me for how I was trolling. This was not low key, it was blatant, and they knew I was trolling. I lost about 250 ranked games to get to bronze 5 - 0 lp, and nobody I played with enjoyed it. I would even bet that many got banned for raging at me during this time. **But I got no punishment whatsoever**\n\nThis season, I have played some, doing the opposite. I tried to play the game correctly, not going full try-hard and demolishing teams, but basically playing my roles correctly. All I did was do what the natural response to trolling is to do, and be mildly upset about it. \n\nI never cursed my team out, I never used derogatory or offensive words, I never told anyone to kill themselves, or called them autistic. I simply defended myself when I was flamed, and called a troll a troll. And now, in WAY less than 250 games, I was permanently banned. \n\nHere it is:\n\n2 games, and this is what the report states - \"Because a player-triggered review found your in-game comms _**EXTREMELY**_ **inflammatory and offensive**, your account's been permanently banned. \n\nThis is what is considered extremely offensive? Declaring blatant truth is EXTREMELY offensive? Claiming that a support should ward is EXTREMELY infammatory, but apparently trolling is not. \n\nGame 1\nslippykitten: why you gotta kill me when im afk?\nslippykitten: no honor?\nslippykitten: jax late\nslippykitten: at least he realized i existed\nslippykitten: you couldve provided a single bit of help knowing i dced and my lane got first blood\nslippykitten: but ya know\nslippykitten: i havent pushed all game\nslippykitten: its like the whole reason you exist\nslippykitten: lol, so if i just abandoned my lane, that would be cool?\nslippykitten: you took my lane when i pinged for you to back\nslippykitten: i cant get zero ganks and give you all my cs and gold bro\nslippykitten: thats my ward that you saw him coming from\nslippykitten: jg too busy farming my lane to troll me\nslippykitten: youre right, feeding jax that wants to troll my lane is certainly my fault\nslippykitten: not sure what you think i should be doing about that\nslippykitten: pls, now jhin can come take my gold and you can continue to complain why im not carrying you\nslippykitten: support, zero wards out\nslippykitten: must be talons fault\nslippykitten: lol\nslippykitten: still waiting to hear what you want me to do\nslippykitten: must be talons fault, not the teemo supp with no sightstone that doesnt place the free wards\nslippykitten: 2/5 jax - the whole team is trolling!\nslippykitten: youre the only one feeding btw jax, maybe its just you?\nslippykitten: lol\nslippykitten: for?\nslippykitten: personally, i would reoport talon\nslippykitten: lol\nslippykitten: trolling jax, sona mid, and a teemop supp without a single supp item\nslippykitten: yup, must be me\nslippykitten: clearly its all talons fault\nslippykitten: everyone knows full apc teemo supp is pro level play\nslippykitten: sightstones are pointless\nslippykitten: and feeding is the way to win\nslippykitten: our support has the lowest ward score on the team, sona mid, and a feeding jg jax that didnt gank, they all blame me all game....\nslippykitten: such toxicity\nslippykitten: jhin is the only person on the team actually playing their role correctly and isnt blaming me\nslippykitten: ward it\nslippykitten: a bit too far out\nslippykitten: too bad nobody else wanted to stop the thing that can end the game for them\nslippykitten: lol\nGame 2\nslippykitten: thanks riot!\nslippykitten: bullshit game\nslippykitten: yeah, my internet and pc are fine\nslippykitten: nope, it isnt\nslippykitten: it happens if i minimize the game, the client crashes\nslippykitten: it happens on multiple pc's iuse, one of which is brand new\nslippykitten: its their client\nslippykitten: or they could fix their shit\nslippykitten: thanks\nslippykitten: right on\nslippykitten: assist yi apparently\nslippykitten: the more you guys ks me the more i have to farm to catch back up\nslippykitten: im not a utility jg\nslippykitten: thesh - \"not gonna help at all?!?!\" i go in, he sits afk under tower\nslippykitten: lol\nslippykitten: ....\nslippykitten: are you aserious\nslippykitten: yeah, i think im done with you guys\nslippykitten: ok, go get em\nslippykitten: lol\nslippykitten: so angry\nslippykitten: dont listen to the haters, salt no good for us\nslippykitten: im sorry i let you down, will you forgive me?\nslippykitten: lol\nslippykitten: not yet, believe in yourselves\nslippykitten: trust me, youre still in this\nslippykitten: im doing my best man, dont be mean\nslippykitten: man thresh, youre a little jaded\nslippykitten: lets just try our best and win this!\nslippykitten: dont worry, keep it cool, we got this\nslippykitten: im doing my best, they're just being toxic, dont worry about it\nslippykitten: why dont you have a sightstone thresh?\nslippykitten: maybe spend less time flaming and more time making sure you gfot the right items\nslippykitten: lol, its my fault theres no wards from the supp?\nslippykitten: somehow, theyre now actually saying its my fault that thresh doesnt have a ss or ward\nslippykitten: thats how blindly toxic theyve become\nslippykitten: notice you didnt say anything when i got a triple and we took two inhibs because of it\nslippykitten: but now you gotta rage\nslippykitten: meanwhile you still have more deaths thresh, but i forgive you man\nslippykitten: i know you must have some things going on to make you this mad, ill pray for you buddy\nslippykitten: thresh man, just relax, i was on the other side of the map, i came as quick as i could\nslippykitten: without wards, how can i know that theyre all topside?\nslippykitten: people really arent out to get you\n\n\nI expect to be downvoted by those wanting to believe Riot is right about all this. I know there are plenty as well that actually think calling someone who's blatantly trolling a troll deserves a permaban while actually ruining games doesn't, and you're entitled to that opinion, despite how insane it is. \n\nI did all this to show that Riot will, **IN FACT, WITHOUT ANY DOUBT**, ban someone permanently for being mildly upset about getting trolled, but will not ever actually ban the trolls themselves.\n\n**EDIT**: \n\nI'm not asking Riot to unban the account. It was a bronze 5 account that I had spent no money on that I used to test these issues out. My main account is fine. I simply want them to admit that clearly there's a problem in their system if I'm banned so quickly for mild chat logs, but not punished at all for 250 games of blatant trolling. \n\nJust admit it riot, and get to work on a system that works. You made false promises with the tribunal that never came back, and games are ruined constantly. I'm trying to help you improve the game, just accept what's right in front of you. \n\n**I also want to point out that riot commented here, but didn't even bother to try to make a point. They claimed that because I had said nothing worthy of a ban 6 times, that it somehow becomes worthy of a ban? And they also tried to say I was \"Constantly trolling\" despite never warning me of that, banning me for that, or providing any data to that. And since I was trolling last season and nobody noticed, even after I admitted it, it seems unlikely they would see even if was, which i wasn't this time. **\n\n**Riot Tantram came into this thread without anything to offer but to try to slander me in a condescending way because he had nothing of substance to offer. When I challenged him, he disappeared. I wish I was surprised. **","replies":[{"poster":"The King Discord","date":"2017-08-02T02:57:48.978+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":23,"body":"apparently insulting riven and vayne mains gets a permaban also","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Tantram","date":"2017-08-02T03:03:02.618+0000","up_votes":62,"down_votes":8,"body":"Just looked up your logs.

I made a false assumption that with thousands of reports, a match history of feeding and blatantly wrong builds and all losses, and a detailed confession, that it was pretty obvious I had been trolling. \n\nAre we really so far into ignoring and protecting trolls that I need an FBI level folder of compelling evidence to indict MYSELF? I literally admitted it, right after it happened, and claimed I should be banned. I guess I should have corroborated witnesses, and taken physical evidence, but I didn't believe it would be this difficult to prove my own guilt. \n\nTo your second point, I can't prove they saw the post and intentionally ignored it. I can say that it is a bit suspicious that Tantram commented on it over a year later though. I can also say, confidently, that they intentionally ignored the thousands of reports i garnered while I was trolling. \n\nBut a few reports from very mild chat logs gets all that data, and that appears to be totally legitimate right?

Each punishment was for chat, never for trolling. This is especially evident since last season I did blatantly troll over 250 games, with ridiculous scores, builds, and losses, and no problem with any of that. But now you're trying to save face by claiming I was banned for trolling? \n\nok, go ahead, show me those matches where, of all the players on my team, I was the one trolling? \n\nI was reported by multiple players often, demanding 6 punishments, because I refused to conform to your Orwellian chat philosophy and keep my mouth shut when I was the one being trolled. This was intentional, to see exactly how mild of a response to being trolled would get me banned. Apparently here it is. Mind you, none of these came when I was actually trolling my team and ruining games. \n\nSo show exactly what demanded the ban. What match was trolling? What chat log was just sooo extreme that it demanded total removal of this kind of toxicity? \n\nResponding with this kind of ambiguous non answer doesn't make your system look better. When I'm banned for \"extremely inflammatory\" chat and you realize it is very clearly not extremely inflammatory, but just the natural human response to being trolled and having to sit through torture for 40 min, you then turn it around and try to claim I was banned for trolling, when no reform card or ban even insinuated that at any time? \n\nCome on Tantram, I'm trying to show how utterly flawed and painful your system is, and you simply want to ignore it. IDK if you can look at the match history from when I trolled an entire season to try to prove this point, but no red seemed to care until a 18 months after it happened. \n\nThis isn't my main account, and my main account has never had any punishment, because I understand exactly what you're intending to do and how to navigate that. I also know that it's utter and complete nonsense and that games are constantly held hostage by people that aren't trying to win in the slightest, and the entire playerbase knows they can't even comment on it or they'll be banned. Which you just proved by banning me now. \n\nThis account should've been banned when it was trolling, not when it was justifiably responding to being trolled. Don't flip flop the situation now to try to save face, it's pretty clear what you're doing. Instead take the lessons and adjust the system to actually benefit players. In fact, since the time of this post, I played two ranked games on my main and got blatant trolls in both. Didn't say a word of course, because we know THAT is what would be the problem...","replies":[{"poster":"Sugar Momma","date":"2017-08-02T06:52:18.856+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"You type more in 1 game than most people will type in 20.
