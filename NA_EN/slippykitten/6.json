Especially in ranked. 1% chance of winning is still better than 0%.\nBut statistically speaking, those 1st bloods, 1st tower, etc win WAY too high % of games. I still grind it out, and hope the enemy throws. But Riot had made it harder for people to derp out and throw a game like they used to. After you get enough of a lead now, you *can* just be stupid and troll and still win. Used to, getting cocky mattered, and you could watch that lead slip away. Now they have to basically repeatedly fountain dive for you to even have a chance.\nBut I still play on, in the 1% hopes they do that. Much to the annoyance of most of me team, who keep telling me it's a 'waste of their time.'\nWell, hey, we're playing a video game, video games *are* time wasters, unless you're actually getting paid to play (pros).
