Any effort they make is on banning the people that get frustrated at the trolls and say naughty words. Every time i bring this up though, it is claimed that Riot is banned trolls and that my experiences must be all delusion. \n\n**So i decided to troll.** I decided to troll every ranked game until i got banned. I used all the trolling techniques. I built as troll as possible intentionally, i purposely fed, i would steal as many kills as possible and then go afk, i would afk farm the jg until my team lost, i would NEVER group with my team, i would ALWAYS steal a role or position in champ select, and then fill it with the worst possible champ, and** i would do anything and everything in my power to make my team have as miserable a game as possible, EVERY SINGLE GAME until i got banned. **\nI didnt just play badly, i played intentionally detrimental to my team and their moral. In fact, probably at least 25% of the games, i played good on purpose, only to go afk with all the gold and make my team lose. \n\nGuess what, 250 ranked games, not a single ban. I ruined the gaming experience for 2,250 players, i negatively impacted matchmaking by single handedly altering the mmr of 2,250 players, i wasted at LEAST 937 hours of other peoples time. The only punishment i received was a chat ban before i started trolling because i was upset i was getting trolled and i got leaverbustered when my entire team lagged out. **But NOT ONE SINGLE PUNISHMENT, or even warning, for trolling the living crap out of everyone all the time. ** \n\nI did all the things that cause players to hate this game, and made every game i was in miserable, and I&#039;m sure i garnered thousands of reports, but not even so much as a warning. This made me sick to stomach to do, but Riot has continued to deny this is a problem and promote delusional statistics to cover it up, and the only way to prove trolls don&#039;t get banned was to become a troll. I didn&#039;t enjoy becoming what has caused me so much frustration, but something, something batman quote. \n\nThis is unacceptable, this is atrocious, this is without defense. This account should have been banned within 5 games of trolling. This account should be permabanned, but instead got zero punishment for trolling. \n\nI&#039;m done with trolling now, i have proven my point. If riot and the community still want to pretend like it isnt a problem, then they can go ahead and let thousands upon thousands of games get trolled every day with no recourse. If Riot wants to read this and then ban my account now, great? But its pointless now, as the damage is already done and i wont be trolling anymore, but at least banning me now would prove they care even a little about trolls. \n\nIt&#039;s been 5 full seasons riot, and i have played every one of them, and the troll problem has never been worse. The only difference is now i know if i dare say a word to the trolls, i&#039;ll get banned. I would be really curious to know how many players got banned for raging on me during those 250 games, but im sure that would just make me that much more disgusted with you. \n\ntl;dr - I trolled 250 ranked games with no punishment to prove Riot does absolutely nothing to address trolls.\n\nEdit: I just want to point out that someone from Riot saw this and decided \"naw, let him go, he doesnt verbally abuse his teammates so its cool\"","replies":[{"poster":"Prandine","date":"2017-12-28T05:29:22.114+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"Locking this as it's run its course and there's no need to necro it anymore.

But you have a sample size of **one troll**, which is not *nearly* a large enough sample size to make such a sweeping claim.

I don't know what the actual success rate is, there, and I wouldn't try to imply otherwise. I simply wish to emphasize this point: *arbitrarily small sample sizes yield results that can be extremely misdirecting*.\n\nSo what do these cases show with certainty? Only that Riot's system is neither an absolute failure, nor an absolute success. As with most things, it lies somewhere between - though where, exactly, would require **significantly** more data to determine.","replies":[{"poster":"slippykitten","date":"2015-11-19T04:51:32.271+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":4,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Jubbinaut,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=g047OoEn,comment-id=000500000000,timestamp=2015-11-19T00:47:48.115+0000)\n>\n> I think you misunderstand my point.\n> \n> You claim that you've proven that Riot doesn't ban trolls - as in, they ban zero trolls.

Each game is a sample, thus it is 250 trolls, unique to each game. None of the people i saw, i ever saw again. So for each of them, it was one troll. 2,250 different people were trolled, and many of them definitely reported me. \n\nThat likely gives riot 250 games that they could have caught a troll, but did not. If i trolled once and didnt get banned, thats an anomaly, if you do it 250 times, it is a test. If i repeat a test 250 consecutive times with the same result, the results are pretty certain at that point.","replies":[{"poster":"Jubbinaut","date":"2015-11-19T06:49:08.343+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":4,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=slippykitten,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=g047OoEn,comment-id=0005000000000000,timestamp=2015-11-19T04:51:32.271+0000)\n>\n> This isnt one troll. Each game is a sample, thus it is 250 trolls, unique to each game. \n\nIt's important to recognize that *to Riot*, there's only one troll. One account. One player. One set of reports. One case. Ergo, one troll.\n\nYour sample size of trolls is 1. Out of 67+ million players (0.0000014925% of the total). Pretty small sample.\n\nBut if you want to talk about your sample size of *trolled games*, we can do that, too. But first, to establish some baseline comparisons:\n\nAssuming ~30 minutes per game, your 250 games covers 125 hours, or about 5 days (rounded down).\n\nThere are approximately 27 million players active each day. I'll arbitrarily assume they play an average of 1.5 games, giving us a rough estimate of 40.5 million games per day. Assuming you played all 250 games consecutively (an obviously false assumption that leans in your favor), over the course of your 5 days of trolling, we have a total of 202.5 million games.\n\nSo your sample size of *trolled games* is 250 out of 202.5 million games (0.0001234568% of the total). Larger, but still incredibly small.\n\n---\n\nIf you don't mind, I'm going to close with this final statement: Please stop assuming that simply because I'm pointing out a flaw in your logic and conclusion that I **disagree** with you.\n\nFor the purposes of posting here, I *do not care* whether you are right or wrong. I do, however, care that your premises and arguments do not support your conclusion. Because only by *recognizing* that, can you seek to rectify it, thereby strengthening your position.","replies":[{"poster":"Coldlance","date":"2017-04-22T22:57:13.835+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"67+ million players,,in your dream!! wtf you say there?","replies":[]},{"poster":"S on Ma Chest","date":"2016-09-26T16:07:38.753+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":6,"body":"Hey get off your elitest high horse kid.

No. His point is that he trolled 250 games **IN A ROW** meaning that he is probably among a very few portion of players to troll THAT many games consecutively, if at all.

I'm very sorry that so many people are stupid and not realizing the implications of your post. The guy who keeps insisting that you trolling over 250 games is just 1 troll is so stupid... he doesn't understand probability at all. \n\n250 games and no ban for trolling is a fucking disgrace. This game is such a joke now. You hit the nail on the head. People can do whatever the fuck they want to make the game a worse experience for you. The only difference now is that if you dare to open your mouth and swear (despite the fact that there is a language filter AND A MUTE BUTTON) you get banned.  My main account was plat 5 and I had been playing it since season 2. In the four years on that account, I had been banned for a day or two periods several times. Then suddenly after the new system came out, I was jumped to a permaban. Why? Because in several games I was foolish enough to open my mouth and yell at people who intentionally trolled/threw the game because they were mad that they didn't get ganks or didn't get the roles that they wanted.\n\nI wish Riot would take your post seriously. You have created undeniable proof that this new system is broken. This game is WORSE than it was before they started trying to implement changes. Honestly, it's sad that a company that pours money into their departments to fix this stuff can get things so wrong. They've decided to push for a G rated game environment where you can fuck over your team however much you like so long as you keep your language G rated. \n\nI have never played another video game where cursing is met with such obscenely harsh punishments. I played xbox live for years and those halo matches haha - they were littered with swearing. \n\n\nAnyway, thanks for making this post. Seriously. Nobody else seems to appreciate it but I want to tell you that I do. You've helped make me realize it's not worth leveling this alt to 30. The same shit will just happen again. Trolls can do whatever they want. Riot has decided to be lazy and use an automated system. An automated system simply cannot account for in game behavior; it can only account for what is said in chat.\n\nI don't know why I stuck around for so long. This game has a really strange capacity to pull you in even when you aren't having fun. There are no other games that I would sit and play for hours despite being miserable in each one. It's as if you desperately keep restarting matches, hoping for ONE good game to justify the hours you've spent playing that night. \n\nHonestly, I know very few people who play league who actually truly enjoy it. At most it's like moderate enjoyment when it's good. But when it's bad, I know tons of people who have a horrible time. Who get absolutely furious and frustrated. The bad just completely outweighs the good, and that's all Riots fault. \n\nDota wasn't like this at all.

I saw cases where people had been reported for in-game actions rather than chat. Intentional feeding in extreme cases was easy to catch. Instances where the person announces their intentions in chat are easy to catch. But there were some where it was just impossible to tell. *If* I was lucky enough to have several descriptions of the behavior included in the reports, sometimes I would vote to punish if the behavior seemed consistent across all or most of the games in the case.\n\nBut I can tell you that in many cases, those last ones were the types of reports that were getting a pass in the system. Because there simply isn't any evidence in the limited amount of information available in a tribunal case. \n\nAlso, they recently rolled out [automatic detection for intentional feeding](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/i5yNt3I5-upgrading-the-intentional-feeder-detection-system), so actually, you can't tell me that they're *not* doing anything.\n\nOther trolling behavior is on their radar as well. But it's going to be extremely complicated to automatically distinguish between trolling and behavior that's okay. Were those two people running double-jungle for fun, or did somebody have their role 'stolen' in champ select, so they just decided to take a jungler and follow the other guy the whole time? Is that duo top lane a strategic pick, or did somebody get left with the jungle position after calling top, and they refused to take it? Is that Bard intentionally ulting his allies to prevent them from doing productive things or not?\n\nIn the meantime, the best way to detect this sort of thing is really with manual reviews of the games in question, which is largely up to Riot to do. The good thing, though, is that with automated systems in place for catching many other types of behavior, they might have more time to try to deal with these cases of trolling.\n\nI mean, what's your goal here anyhow?
