When i get back, my 6 yr old has been playing for me for the past 20 min or so. She is 1/17/1 as the adc, i was actually pretty proud she managed to get a kill, considering she has never even used a computer before. \r\nHowever, what i read in chat disturbs me. Rather than the entire team raging me (my daughter) and reporting me, they are all ganging up on our toplane who was asking that the enemy team report our troll adc. He didnt curse, or unnecessarily insult, he just asked them to report the adc who was obviously trolling. My team opted to report him instead of me. \r\n\r\nThis illustrated perfectly to me a key problem in Riots report/reform systems. That guy had every right to be frustrated with me for ruining his ranked game and every right to demand that i be reported and punished. Instead riots system and punishments favor me and instead lean towards punishing the player that was the victim. \r\n\r\nWe need a system that better identifies the players harming games and punishes them instead of one punishing the one who vocalizes the problem.","replies":[{"poster":"mvargus","date":"2015-06-02T20:04:11.119+0000","up_votes":86,"down_votes":16,"body":"I'd like to point out that there are rules on what your account could have been reported for.\n\nOffensive Language?   - I hope your 6 year old wasn't typing anything offensive, even if they knew how to chat\n\nVerbal Abuse? - not something your 6 year old was likely to do again, how well can they spell words\n\nNegative Attitude?  - sounds like your 6 year old was just having fun copying what you do, I doubt they showed any attitude.\n\nIntentional Feeding?  - always a tough call.  You didn't watch the play so you couldn't say.\n\n---\n\nMost  likely the report should have been for \"unskilled player\" which would have been an honest statement.\n\nWhat it sounds like is that when you had to leave the team realized there was a problem, and most of them while probably unhappy accepted that \"things happen.\"  Your 6 year old tried, but couldn't play at the skill level necessary.  But the top laner rather than manning up and sucking it in decided to try to drag the other team into reporting you.\n\nWHICH IS A MAJOR VIOLATION OF THE EULA!!!!!  The top laner was violating the entire Summoner's Code which quite clearly states that asking people to report someone should always be reported.   Worse, he was dragging additional people into a discussion they didn't want to deal with.  I personally HATE having someone say \"report X for Y\".    I usually can't see what they are saying, and for me intentional feeding requires that you run down mid and directly into an enemy champ multiple times.  Someone who is trying hard and struggling might get me to report for \"unskilled\" but that report doesn't do much, so I usually leave it alone.\n\n\nSorry, but to me what happened was your 6 year old saved you from a \"leaving game/AFK\" report and the top laner's own bad attitude got him reported.\n\nThe system actually worked close to how its supposed to, unless you consider the fact that your 6 year old sharing the account should get it banned outright, but since all they did was sit down at the computer when you were called away, its impossible to prove that.","replies":[{"poster":"Terchio","date":"2015-06-02T21:25:05.137+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":2,"body":"Wait... that's in the EULA? That sounds oddly specific to make its way on there... I'll have to try to find that.\n\nEdit: I'm afraid that's not in a quick EULA search. The EULA had no mention of reporting, and the Terms of Use only say that you can be reported, and that the Tribunal of Peers may step in. The Tribunal Policy then states guidelines for the process, but goes into no detail of what can be reported, clearly omitting this sentiment. And finally, the Summoner's Code does probably consider this an infraction, maybe on multiple levels, but I see numerous infractions per game, even in the civil ones. Also, not once in the Summoner's Code was the word \"report\" or any of its other forms written, and therefore it is a vague representation for the rule at best.\n\nAt very least, the sentiment that it is a \"major\" violation of anything is not derived from those forms alone. In fact, Riot has left it incredibly vague to the point that if we thought serial AFKing was okay, so did they.","replies":[{"poster":"Gavran","date":"2015-06-03T08:04:14.665+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"The EULA references following the Summoners Code, the Summoners Code is what was being claimed to contain that.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ChargeItDownMid","date":"2015-06-02T20:37:24.413+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":22,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"GundayMonday","date":"2015-06-02T21:04:09.292+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":7,"body":"Read the summoner's code.

If you need to spectate him the whole game to decide whether he needs a report, he surely doesn't need any.\n\n> That is purely speculative and not applicable towards all players.

Not getting flamed however is not going to offend anyone. \n\n> I would much rather use the terms of services since the summoner's code actually does a pretty bad job at saying what is and is not bannable and seems to defer to the terms of ue.\n\nWell it's essentially all about attitude.\nThe Summoner's Code wants us to behave in a way that is making the game experience better.

It is because instead of actually attempting to fix the problem, they are trying to throw a rug over the reaction. Yes, that is one game your daughter played for you. You have to realize, however, that they're people literally doing what your daughter did every game just for fun. What they are doing is the equivalent of turning on your air conditioner to \"fix\" global warming.","replies":[{"poster":"Remlap1223","date":"2015-06-02T20:40:34.013+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":6,"body":"Pretty much this.  Riot's \"community policing\" is a long running joke, because it has done literally nothing to the toxicity problem.  Games being toxic are caused by Riot's horrible matchmaking system that puts players with peers that are far outside of their skill level.  Because League is a team focused game, this causes major fights, because unless your skill level far greater than everyone in the game, and you're playing a champion that can pubstomp, then sorry support mains, you're staying in Bronze forever.  But Riot deflects this argument just by saying \"teh toxicity!!1!\" and the community eats it up.  It's why assholes are allowed to troll in the pre-game in order to get what roles they want.  It's why games are so frustrating to play when someone is being negative because you're forced to deal with them for at least twenty minutes, most likely more.  It's why people lose their chat privileges by arguing their case against their teammates when the team gangs up and calls your bad play intentionally feeding.  It's why despite the fact that all these systems are in place, League STILL has the most toxic community in video games.","replies":[{"poster":"mvargus","date":"2015-06-02T20:48:22.363+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Remlap1223,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=jROuVx86,comment-id=00050000,timestamp=2015-06-02T20:40:34.013+0000)\n>\n> It's why despite the fact that all these systems are in place, League STILL has the most toxic community in video games.\n\nI'm going to disagree with this last line.  I've played a ton of different MMO's and other online games over the 20+ years I've had a computer and internet access.  I won't say that League is sunshine and puppy dogs, but compared to some of the other communities I've hung out in League is not the most toxic.\n\nHeck, if you don't try to cultivate toxicity you will actually rarely run into it.  I've had maybe 2 bad games in my last 50 and in both cases I was playing a champ I know I need a lot of practice on so I didn't entirely disagree with the person who went toxic, only with him being toxic in a normal match.  (I don't play champs I need practice on in ranked.)\n\nMost of the people who I find complaining about the way RIOT deals with the toxic players often later post about bans they got and they usually try to claim they were goaded into it.  I expect that most of the complaints about this community being toxic are from people who are toxic themselves and who fear the new system as its far more likely to throw bans their way now.\n\nThe system isn't perfect, but I expect it will be surprisingly effective.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"RoG Vahn","date":"2015-06-04T18:16:17.010+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"they ban the victims of toxicity instead of banning the toxic people so all that is left is the toxic players.","replies":[{"poster":"SexyTaylorSwift","date":"2015-06-04T18:18:36.906+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't want to play the victim card here, though.
