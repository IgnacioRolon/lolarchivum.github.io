League is the best and the worst game I've ever played simply from seemingly random events out of my control. The issue I've had with this game since season 5 is the constant meta shifts based one single patches. The whole ban phase gets whacked just from 1 or 2 champs getting ridiculous buffs and the 6 champs you were banning last week still didn't get balanced.

Balance is atrocious at the moment, and if you can actually get a game which doesn't have \"1st time Syndra ranked k\" or just whacked meta picks like Ashe jungle then count yourself lucky. I honestly haven't seen this much crap ever in League.\n\nAnd I have felt the urge myself as well to be a dick. After bad games with trolls, you want nothing more than to say FUCK THIS GAME and queue up and just troll yourself. The game has become a mecca for trolling and flaming to the point that it's basically accepted. In what game should you just accept being told you're a piece of shit and I wish you had cancer and you should die? I honestly NEVER experienced that shit until the start of Season 5 ( been playing since season 3). The solution of \" report and move on \" doesn't even do anything. 99% of the time you never hear about them being banned, and since you honestly have a troll in 4/5 games, your reports carry no merit since you are reporting all the time. Also, what's the point of reporting anyway? Your games done, you lost, there is a good chance you may NEVER interact with that player again; the damage has already been done.\n\nI took a 2 month break from League from September to November because I was away on work; when I came back I was actually looking forward to play again; just to realize the game has only gotten worse. At the moment, I might play 2 games a week; I read and watch League now more than I play.","replies":[{"poster":"MohawkBird","date":"2016-02-24T23:49:41.993+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Give me a time in League when balance was not a problem? I think you'd have a hard time finding it. The thing about a game like this is that it constantly has to be balanced. Champion, game, and item changes have effects that are unpredictable.

It's all in the head. It's the same reason we constantly see threads come out like \"This season is BY FAR the worst,\" when it simply is not true. People love to think every other season in league has been happy go lucky and 100% balanced and fun and somehow it's worse now than it ever was.
