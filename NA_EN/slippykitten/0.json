Some of the rioters in charge of certain champ updates dont even have any games logged on them!\n\n4) they clearly only play these accounts because they are forced to. \n\nSo why is this a problem? \n\n1) Because this game is so touchy, intricate and carefully balanced that every minor decision made impacts the game a great deal. Without verification that riot employees are even experiencing the changes they implement, it is easy to feel like they are disconnected. \n\n2) if we cant see that they even care to play the champs we love that need help, it makes it appear as if they simply dont care about them. \n\n3) If rioters arent playing normals, 3's, dominion or aram games, it is easy to feel like those modes are heavily neglected\n\n4) they dont have to frequently feel the frustration of toxic players so we think they are less interested in dealing with them\n\nAs well as a slew of other reasons. \n\nOf course Rioters probably play on other accounts, but we have no verification of that. I bet some of them do play often, but i would also bet some of them never play outside of what is required. \n\ntl;dr - i want to be able to see that rioters care enough to actually play their game so i can feel confident that at least they believe in the choices they make.\n\nedit: i can see now that players would rather just be told everything is ok than to actually see Riot employees playing. Blind trust OP, my mistake. ","replies":[{"poster":"GroundRuleDouble","date":"2015-04-28T16:40:58.498+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":1,"body":"I really can't believe what i just read.
