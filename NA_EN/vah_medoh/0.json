Either way it looks great so far!  The detail on the ears is especially impressive to me--you got the subtle shapes of the fur, veins, and cartilage to be very nice!\n\nFeedback:\nI think the muzzle on top of his nose should protrude more.  His snout seems to be a flat plane, with the top of the snout &amp; nose being on single line.  I think the snout should curve down into the top of the nose, as per his splashart.  So the top of the snout shares (or at least, is close to) the plane of the FRONT of his nose, not the top, If that makes any sense.","replies":[{"poster":"Vah Medoh","date":"2019-09-29T00:01:30.649+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the feedback.
