Game closes once i finish a game,  game is won or lost, no lobby after the game, just the message, someone logged into my account from another pc. After logging in its fine again for 1 - few games, until same problem occures. It startet after the latest patch with new masteries. From time to time after one of those crashes, when i log in same message appears, and instantly closes my game after i just started it. The only solution to log in is to kill all LoL processes per task - manager. After that i can log in and play a game or two, just to get kicked out at the end of game. Did not get kicked out during a match even once, only at the end, when the lobby should occure, or while logging in after such game crash.\r\nWhat i have done so far:\r\n1 - changed password\r\n2 - reinstalled the game\r\n3 - killed everything on my pc and reinstalled windows\r\nnothing helps, it seems to be on the games side","replies":[{"poster":"Kabouros","date":"2018-01-21T10:06:47.466+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have the same issue.\nGame ends and closes my client and launcher and tells me \"game was logged in from another computer.\"\n\nI have recently changed my password too.\nMalwarebyte and Windows Defender gives me clean result.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-11-10T22:01:03.779+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey this is a really strange issue!
