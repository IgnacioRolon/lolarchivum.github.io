One, possibly two? Sure.. you can get a couple of asshats here and there, but four complete strangers completely gang up on you? That is either very rare, or you are doing more than simply picking a champion to piss people off.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Killstrado","date":"2015-05-09T13:09:34.675+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey I got a good idea, lets punish people for not playing they way I want them too.

Them playing to their liking is them intentionally trolling. And no, I didn't rage at my teammates. But it doesn't really matter what I say about that topic, you are just going to assume that I did because anyone who is upset with Riot is just a whiny ragey bitch.

It's getting to the point where i dont even want to play. I mainly run jungle and for some reason if there is an Ekko in the group chances are he is the troll. out of the last 5 games i've played with an ekko, he always seems to enjoy stealing gromp keeping me from getting my level up and being able to take blue buff. If i'm playing adc with tahm, he loves to just swallow me or the mid and run directly into the enemies then ults out. Its incredible with all the complaints people put in about this and all the reports, rarely do i notice someone getting banned for purposefully making everyone else have a bad experience in the game. I love that this game is F2P but at the same time F2P is troll central. Something needs to be done about these players as suggested. You know when there's a troll before champ select is even over. AFKs need a bigger penalty than 30 minutes or whatever it is, they need to banned for days and if its ongoing permabanned","replies":[]},{"poster":"branasce","date":"2015-05-08T23:26:53.937+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"well, then don't dodge.
