Had a bad game and next think I know i get a message that my account was suspended,\r\n I put in a ticket to go went to chat, this is the conversation\r\nMe\r\nI want to know why there was no reason given, \r\n\t\r\nChat started\r\n\t\r\nPlayer Support Bot\r\nHey! We&rsquo;re getting a ton of new chats right now. It may take upwards of 30 minutes to get to your chat, but if you sit tight we&rsquo;ll help you out as soon as we can. If you&rsquo;re not about that waiting in line lifestyle, you can always submit a ticket instead!\r\nOrphi joined the chat\r\nOrphi\r\nHello there!\r\nI&#039;ll go have a look to see why your account was suspended.\r\nMe\r\nhi\r\nok\r\n\t\r\nOrphi\r\nSorry for the wait, I got up your account and it looks like it was suspended for the use of scripting software or cheating software. :S\r\nMe\r\ni dont have anything like that\r\nOrphi\r\nI&#039;m going to run my own investigation though to make sure it was properly placed- the last thing we wanna do is ban someone&#039;s account by mistake.\r\nMe\r\nok\r\nso what do u need me to do?\r\nOrphi\r\nI&#039;ll just need you to wait a minute or two basically! I will get back with you ASAP after my investigation of the account.\r\nMe\r\nok\r\nOrphi\r\nThanks for your patience, it took a bit longer than I expected, but I am done now\r\nMe\r\nok\r\nty for getting back with me\r\nOrphi\r\nNo problem!\r\nSo I looked over the account and it does look like scripts were heavily used in games. I am not allowed to say when they were used or what they did, due to the sensitive nature of that info, it can be used against us\r\nI understand you said it wasnt your doing, but I am not seeing any suspicious log ins or unauthorized access on the account. :(\r\nMe\r\nok first off ive never used any scripts\r\nat all period\r\nive might have not played that well\r\nbut that doesnt me ive cheated\r\nOrphi\r\nI&#039;m not trying to accuse you of anything, I am only reporting what I found.\r\nMe\r\nok can you send me a copy\r\n\t\r\nsince it is my account\r\n\t\r\nso that i can contest it\r\n\t\r\nif it means that im still under ban\r\nOrphi\r\nYour account&#039;s suspension would be remaining I&#039;m afraid. But how do you mean send you a copy exactly? I can&#039;t give yo uthe information relating to the scripting we found though as I stated earlier- that information is sensitive and can be used against us to make our future investigations for scripting harder.\r\nMe\r\nur full of shit\r\n\t\r\nall because some assholes\r\n\t\r\ngot pissed and reported me because they where mad they lost\r\n\t\r\non a blind pick i called my lance\r\n\t\r\ni called sup\r\n\t\r\nno one took a jungler\r\n\t\r\nso how is it my fault\r\n\t\r\nand my adc just stood there like a moron the whole game\r\n\t\r\nbut if ur going to suspend me for cheating then maybe i should start doing so\r\n\t\r\nso\r\n\t\r\ni want to know exaclty why u think im scriping\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\nOrphi\r\nWell this isn&#039;t based on a report, it&#039;s a suspension we issue after an extensive investigation for software that interacts with the game files in the client that gives an unfair advantage.\r\nMe\r\nso that automitically make me guilty\r\n\t\r\nbs\r\n\t\r\ni have no idea what softeware you are talking about\r\n\t\r\ngive me a list\r\n\t\r\nbull shit\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\nOrphi\r\nI wouldn&#039;t be able to provide such a list because if I did then you would be able to give that information to those who make the software and tell them what happened. I&#039;m not saying that&#039;s what you WOULD do, but its the risk of it which is why I cannot\r\nMe\r\nwhyh\r\n\t\r\ni have no software\r\n\t\r\nothere then you pos client that sure acts like a virus\r\n\t\r\nthat why i think a plane need to dive staight in your office\r\n\t\r\ni think you coulndt find anythging so ur making it up\r\n\t\r\nthats why it tool longer\r\n\t\r\nso ur just giving an exsuce because there isnt anything but ur client\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\nOrphi\r\nI&#039;m not making it up, really\r\nMe\r\ni want a manager\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\nOrphi\r\nit&#039;s a bad business practice to lie to players and much less ban an account for no reason.\r\nMe\r\nbecause\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\nOrphi\r\nThere are no higher escalations of Player Support specialist I can escalate you to, sorry.\r\nMe\r\ni want a manager why would i spend money on this game when you can make up whatever reason to ban me\r\n\t\r\nwell that is the case someone made a mistake i have no scripts running on this game or any game i play\r\n\t\r\nso i am being banned for something i didnt do\r\n\t\r\nso how is that fair\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\nOrphi\r\nI understand it feels like this is very one sided, I don&#039;t blame you, but I can confirm this isn&#039;t us making anything up here. I have investigated the account and found 3rd party tools were being used on the account, and whether it was you or not as the account owner you are responsible for all activity on the account. I won&#039;t be removing the suspension because of the association with scripts on it. There&#039;s no manager I can send you to and any other agent will tell you the same thing.\r\nMe\r\nwhat lol sumo?\r\n\t\r\nits on my phone\r\n\t\r\nit doenst run on my pc as a matter of fact its not on and they paid for access to api which u guys sell to access ur website\r\n\t\r\nit doenst play the game for me\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\nOrphi\r\nNo it wouldn&#039;t be lolsumo\r\n\t\r\nsince lolsumo doesn&#039;t interact with the client as you said\r\nMe\r\nthats the only tool i have\r\n\t\r\nso im fucked\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\nOrphi\r\nI see. I sadly can&#039;t undo the suspension no.\r\nMe\r\nreally\r\n\t\r\ni an sooo pissed rigjh no and u have given me a fucking shred of everidenct so i will make bots for this game\r\n\t\r\nso u can just go ahead and perma ban this accoiunt if you want but i will make 1000s of them\r\n\t\r\nso\r\n\t\r\nyou want to accuse me then fine i guess no i qwill be guiltly of it\r\n\t\r\nfuck oifff\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\nOrphi\r\nIt is your time to use for what you wish.\r\n\t\r\nUnless you have any other questions I&#039;ll be closing this chat out.\r\nMe\r\ni wasnt my account back cna i have it back\r\n\t\r\ni want my account back can i have it back last chance\r\n\t\r\nunless u can show me logs proving i was scripting\r\n\t\r\nother then a bunche of asshole nbeoing pussys\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\nOrphi\r\nSorry, as I said before I cannot provide specific evidence of the scripting on the account. That information can be used against us to make scripts harder to detect in thefuture. We want to make sure the game is fair and has no cheating.\r\nMe\r\nbecause u have none there is none to find yu are full of fucking shit i wasnt my ticket esscalated\r\n\t\r\nur fucking full fo shit\r\n\t\r\ndo u need vnc what\r\n\t\r\nu can look at my machine\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\nOrphi\r\nAs you have no other concerns I will be closing this chat out. Good bye.\r\nMe\r\nyeah have a big concern this is fucking bullshoit i have done nothing wrong\r\n\t\r\nand i being wrongfully accused\r\n\t\r\nso yes i have a big concerin this is a bullshit reason im going to get on forums and start posting everythinbgw we descussed and im putting it on facebook to make people aware of this crap","replies":[{"poster":"Nine Realms","date":"2018-06-07T03:37:48.277+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm glad you got banned, look how rude you were to the support person, he tried to help & stuff.","replies":[{"poster":"Baldmenace","date":"2018-06-08T02:09:17.979+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"see its people like you guys that are the cause of this bs, yes i was rude but he outright lied about me having scripted and thats why i was angry.

I hardly call that help when you make up something to let the vote stand he was just being lazy and Im not the only one riot has done this to. Also all i have to do is get a bunch of people to vote you as scripting and you account is banned , so basically everyone is guilty until proven innocent. You know what I'm glad they banned me to from assholes like you all. I hope that the Creator is right about the an apocalypse you get what you guys deserve. Lying , cheating , stealing and bearing false witness is ok in your book i guess .

It may be that there are things on your computer you don't know about that register as scripts to Riot's detection, but historically they *do* put a lot of energy into confirming their data is accurate on whether or not anything has been touching data it shouldn't be touching. If they say something was detected, then *something* was detected.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PLS GÓD NÓ","date":"2018-06-07T04:17:58.253+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You deserve an Ip-Ban, cuz ur were a jerk to that customer support rep.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Modi","date":"2018-06-07T04:16:44.129+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"On another note, they cheating of this kind in waves.

The best part is I can tell it is a bullshit ban because of the fact that he had to search for cheats. But you got suspended after a game ended, which means the machine would've had to find them first. All he would've had to do was bring up your account, look at the system to find the reasoning and specific games you were reported for, and examine them, examining anything else is out of the bounds of the suspension and you really should send another ticket and hope to get a different person, or keep ticketing the same guy until somebody tells you the truth, that the system was wrong.","replies":[]}]}
