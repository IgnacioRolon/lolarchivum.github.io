Blizzard is a great example of this; Blizzard didn't want players getting scammed by people who sold gold for real money, so they made it possible to buy gold with real money through them. It would immediately combat the unfair level 1-30 grind if players who have already reached level 30 could just go to the shop and buy an account.\r\n\r\nNow you might think \"then people could just have 5 or 6 accounts and never have to worry about dodging\".\r\n\r\nTo which I say: \r\n1. By having ***that many*** accounts, they're already nullifying their grind by a lot by splitting their playtime across multiple accounts and lowering their LP through dodges, and will either never reach their potential peak or won't have every account in the elo they want their accounts in.\r\nand\r\n2. You can also combat that by *linking* the purchased account to the account that it was purchased by; you wouldn't be able to purchase another account from the linked account, and, like refunds, you'll never in your lifetime be able to buy more than x amount of accounts. We'll say 2, since most players stop at 3 accounts.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's easy, gives Riot money (and we know how much Riot loves adding unreasonably priced microtransactions for the sake of money), and combats every problem!","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-07-03T00:04:56.898+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"* A lot of sold accounts are stolen\n\n* Riot does not want banned players getting back in with no effort","replies":[{"poster":"Catffeine","date":"2019-07-03T00:15:43.662+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So, once again, let me remind you of the \"account linking\" part.
