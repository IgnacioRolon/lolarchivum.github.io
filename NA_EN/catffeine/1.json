Her winrate is at an all time low, and her pick rate is decreasing, but she's still a complete bully during the early game. These changes help reduce her early game threat. Her problem is her scaling; she has an absolutely horrible midgame and a lackluster late game. Riot will probably look into that in future patches. She will, without a doubt, be awful next patch, and I don't agree with a champion being so bad that they can't be picked, but Riot probably realizes that and will be quick to tweaking her late game.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with Karthus jungle being viable. These changes aren't to eliminate him out of being picked as a jungler, they're to prevent him from doing what he's been doing of just sitting in jungle all game and still having the highest kill participation on the team with ridiculously high damage. He seldom had to leave his jungle to gank; just hit 6 as soon as possible and pressure with R while farming to make R do more damage. This will encourage him to leave the jungle more for ganks.\n\nGalio was allowed to be a poke support, a tank, and a hard engage support. The way you counter a poke lane is to shove the wave so they can't poke as hard; the way you counter a hard engage support is to freeze so they can't engage. But when he was able to do both, it made it very difficult to play against. If you froze, you'd get pushed into tower and poked down. If you pushed, you'd get zoned out of farming. His reduced damage will direct him into being more of an engage support than a lane bully.\n\nJayce is another lane bully that's getting a high pickrate right now. His Q does a ridiculous amount of damage at all phases of the game. Nerfing it was necessary to keep him viable without him being overwhelming.\n\nMalphite is being picked as AP too frequently.

This will reduce his pressure in those elos specifically.\n\nRammus is seeing a lot more play recently against low mobility or heavy AD teams. This is because, although he's a tank, he does a ridiculous amount of damage. A champion shouldn't be allowed to deal a significant amount of damage while building only tank. This will reduce the amount of damage he outputs.\n\nTeemo and Wukong both needed reworks; their kits don't fit the state of the game (very outdated).\n\nZac was seeing the same problem as Rammus; dealing a huge lot of damage while being allowed to be tanky and have an overbearing amount of crowd control. This reduces his damage output and the amount of crowd control he's allowed to put out in a short duration. As well, Zac's ult was very clunky and a bit unfair; as well as reducing the amount of crowd control, this will keep crowd control in his kit without it being overwhelming.","replies":[{"poster":"Nameless Drifter","date":"2019-05-24T14:35:44.306+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Akali issue is the fact she can spam Q's while in shroud with no counterplay available unless you have a hard cc spell.

She even has the luxury to go Conqueror and build bruiser to melt tanks and still delete people. \n\n\nKarthus jungle is a toxic and unhealthy concept to the game. If you really think a tiny damage nerf will do anything, you are too optimistic to actually be realistic. He needs to be removed from the jungle role, because first of all he is a midlaner, and the fact he is more played in the jungle only shows that Riot miss treated him and he should be put back in the Midlane since its his main role. \n\nEnough of this stupid forced inclusion of champions to be played in the jungle, its not healthy for the game, and it breaks the balance and the kits of them. We already have enough junglers, stop forcing non junglers into the role.\n\n\n\nGalio a poke support? What the hell are you talking about.
