The new client has been slow AF and nothing would seem to work for some cases even reinstalling wouldn't work. So the problem is that i assume the registry files have probably just Fked up the games programing or some shit. \r\nWhat i did was i downloaded ccleaner and with it i cleaned out all of the useless registry files where i actually found files related to league. \r\nhttps://www.piriform.com/ccleaner \r\nIt cleaned up all the shit and my client seems to be working perfectly and i hope it stays this way if this really was the issue. If this doesn't work try uninstalling the game then cleaning your registry files again and reinstalling its gonna be hectic but you gotta do what you gotta do to play.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-18T23:42:03.013+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"NIce job getting that figured out on your own!

Go into your client options, and turn on the new option called low-spec mode. It helps reduce some of the lagginess that can sometimes happen with the new client, so give that a show and let me know how it works!","replies":[{"poster":"Karmo","date":"2018-01-02T23:09:45.210+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So i can see this is 8 months ago but my friend is still having same issue even tho his client is on low mode, we get leaver busters all the time because his client is too slow while in game he has no issues, pls could you make EXTRA low mode just for him and players like him ty.","replies":[]},{"poster":"NeMeSiS KiLLeR x","date":"2017-05-22T18:01:40.264+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it didnt help i dunno why it seems like its a switch when the switch is on the game becomse laggy and buggy some of the common issues are \n1.
