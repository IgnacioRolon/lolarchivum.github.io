The people who say gold = silver have never been in silver for quite a long time. While gold isnt perfect, it is infinitely better then silver because you hardly every get brand new players.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Done25","date":"2018-07-31T16:52:00.061+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=GripaAviara,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=h9aecKuv,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-07-31T14:08:35.804+0000)\n>\n> You&#x27;re right, mid-silver is the hell\n\nThis.

Toxicity is something we expect in certain MMR traps- bronze 5, mid silver, plat 5, diamond 5.... but the truth is any player can have an ego / an issue. I have seen plenty of Diamond players, whilst not typing, either soft-int or intentionally miss-macro by afk-splitpushing, which is still toxic. Higher elos tend to be more protective of their account / ranked rewards, so they'll keep it out of chat.\n\nI've experienced a few gold teams that don't listen to pings / strats, but I think they're equal in that with other players. It's shocking when it happens though, because you expect a good player to listen to a good suggestion.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RookPusher","date":"2018-07-31T20:22:55.972+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel like most people are leaving out bronze because half the crowd is watching too much Lifetime and eating dorito's to get toxic.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lucian Waifu","date":"2018-07-31T20:03:38.707+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Silver is terrible, gold is pretty good, then back to terrible with platinum and it's even worse in diamond.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LeftyRaydy","date":"2018-07-31T19:16:59.959+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly Plat 5 is one of the worst. players who have great mechanics and decent game knowledge, but do not want to listen to anyone else because they would be diamond if it wasn't for their shitty team.
