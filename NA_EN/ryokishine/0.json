That is okay, you are allowed to disagree with the system, I'm just here to inform you of what happened, and I can give you resources to provide feedback on how the system should change.\r\n\r\nPlayer Support doesn't actually make changes to the game, we're more here to help you with how it exists currently. If you want to start a discussion on how you would change it, I encourage you to. But in the right place so your feedback can actually be seen by the right people. The correct place to do so is on our boards: https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/ The most important part of this is getting the buy in from the community, and exploring the idea out. Our devs watch over the boards and keep pulse on what players are talking about, and they may even reply to your post.\r\n\r\nAlthough I may not be able to make the changes you're looking for, I hope I've given you the right place to give your feedback. Let me know if you have any other questions.\"\r\n\r\nMy main account (this one) was permanently banned for a game where I try to lead my team to victory despite the fact that they wanted to give up, refused to work together as a team, and called me horrible things throughout the entire game.

I just want my account back, to be honest. This was wrong. The system has failed me I feel like. I know others have felt this way, too.\r\n\r\nHad these players not treated me so horribly, I doubt I ever would have been banned... Alas, the system completely ignores the context in which infractions occur, and good people get banned because bad people won't simply leave them alone.\r\n\r\nYes, the argument exists that the /mute all and /fullmute all systems can be used to alleviate this stress. However, as a good team leader, severing all communication with one's team is a great way to lose the game quicker. One could also argue that you could leave their pings unmuted, but oftentimes people will even use those to flame and harass others for the smallest mistake or misstep.\r\n\r\nPlease Upvote this if you agree that the context of the situation should matter more when it comes to Chat Bans and Suspensions.\r\n\r\nI've been informed by Riot Iron Wings that there's nothing Support can, or will, do in scenarios such as this.

I get you were no Adolf here but none the less this was your 4th offence I imagine. How many do you want? Or do they just not ban people. You realize we all deal with bad players right? Today I had an ezreal die 3 times then go afk in a ranked. Note that the ONLY thing said to him was by the support (not me) was you need to chill  I am assuming she was talking about his engages.We were also doing well in other lanes) Then I had a bot lane die 4 times in 5 mins. I said nothing, though I was annoyed to all hell. By 7 mins it was 3/17 and they were at our inhib turret....\n\nMy point is that if any person like you for instance in those matches started flipping shit while I was already dealing with everything else. It is a huge pain in the ass to me knowing, you could be helping more instead of typing to whoever the hell the problem is. \n\nI mean we aren't blind we know the guy thats 0/17 is bad we don't need you to announce it. It does not matter who started it what matters is you became a NEW problem on top of the existing one. I do not understand why this is so hard to grasp. That is literally the reason why they do not CARE who started it.","replies":[{"poster":"Ryokishine","date":"2019-03-23T03:23:05.825+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":11,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"zPOOPz","date":"2019-03-23T03:47:43.101+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"defending my Honor\" is not a shield to be toxic and frankly a cyber bully yourself.

Those chat logs are definitely not perma worthy in my book at all but the truth is that it's more lucrative for riot to ignore context, and let their robot perma people while they swim in money. It takes a lot of man power and money to thoughtfully review games properly and they simply don't want to spend the money.\n\nMy advice to you is to not bother posting on this board. You won't find any empathy or understanding. It's just an echo chamber full of rioters in disguise, riot fanboyz, and snowflakes who got their feelings hurt that just agree with each other and shit on anyone who questions their \"perfect\" system. It's everything that's wrong with the internet today and another perfect example of why the league community fucking sucks. \n\nAlso, look at the match history of all the people flaming you in this thread (ironically the same people telling you not to flame lmao) and you'll see these people hardly even play ranked games.
