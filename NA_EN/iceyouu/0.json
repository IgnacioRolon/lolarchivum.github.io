Right click your desktop &amp; go to Display settings (for windows 10) if you have any other OS there are other ways to get to your screens resolution.\r\n**Second** - Scroll down to resolution and change it to 1280 x 800. This will allow your client to change from 1024 x 576 to other resolutions! After opening the client and changing the resolution to what you want you can go back to your monitor's res and change it back to it's native resolution.\r\n\r\nI hope this helped!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-09T23:45:31.355+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Side Note: make sure your OS res and in-game res match each other.
