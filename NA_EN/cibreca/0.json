(and BUGS)","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It might be my web provider, but occasionally I go through fits of disconnects.  Sometimes, it doesn't affect my game; but other times, not only do I get a random death (BUG--with NO explanation but rather the death explanation from an earlier death) but I also miss out on all of the discussion while I was disconnected (even messages from friends.)\r\n\r\nObviously, I'd like a better web provider--easier said than done.  But while I get why we can't become invulnerable right when we disconnect (i.e. that can be abused), the system can, either immediately send a champ running back to base as soon as they disconnect (which, since I've seen others disconnect, I know it doesn't) or at least show them what was said during a dc and properly notify them as to how they died.  When I dc and get killed, I don't have any information on why I died--because for some reason the notification isn't updated for my DC'd death.\r\n\r\nAlso, if the enemy can know that I dc that would be great.  Obviously, when a champ pauses in the middle of battle, it's probably a dc; but at least with a global notification, it's not confused.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-19T15:29:29.849+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The game requires a constant connection to communicate the match between your network and our servers.
