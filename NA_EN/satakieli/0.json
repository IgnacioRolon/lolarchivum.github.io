Just had a 30-game winning streak, climbed from the depths of Bronze to S3, all was good. Now, climbing is substantially harder because I always encounter boosters, on my team and on the enemy team. Sometimes I can face them , other times they just start the game with &#039;Hehe I&#039;m D4 booster GGWP losers&#039;, proceed to have 11cs/min and get 21 kills in 13 minutes (happened yesterday). Okay, I am not going to talk about how we know if someone is boosting or not.\r\n\r\nWhat matters is that currently Riot isn&#039;t paying enough attention to them. I have plenty of examples.\r\n\r\nThis post isn&#039;t meant to be offensive or a complaint-out-of-tilt, it&#039;s just because right now sooooo many people are trying to climb and learn, and these boosters just take this chance away from them. This also applies to the booster&#039;s team: nobody will ever learn any game mechanics and carry tactics if they just get carried by a Vayne who takes all the kills and gets 4 solo pentas. They&#039;ll just watch and tell themselves &#039;oh free win, let&#039;s stop trying to improve my skill this game, cause I&#039;ll win anyway&#039;.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m not even talking about the booster&#039;s enemy team. Poor people. Always hearing &#039;haha noobs haha low elo idiots, I am Diamond, idiots, hehe&#039;. This keeps happening and Riot doesn&#039;t seem to bat an eye. Below I&#039;ll give an example which has occurred for more times than you can imagine.\r\n\r\nMe: *encounters booster*\r\nMe: *wants to make sure they&#039;re cheating, so check their match history. I am looking at a B4 account with 400 games and 36% winrate, today they suddenly start playing Vayne for the first time and either gets solo pentas, or goes 1/25 and then they suddenly get 30 kills in a row and carry. This is the best way to see if someone is boosting: people that look like they&#039;re inting and then they suddenly have Faker mechanics and game sense*\r\nMe: *reports paid booster to Riot, and checks the account a few weeks later. It&#039;s still being boosted. Facepalm*\r\n\r\nNo idea what to do.","replies":[{"poster":"mlm olo mlm","date":"2018-10-23T12:53:02.252+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm more interested in how you had a 30 game win streak and only went up bronze to silver?\n\nNEVER has a bronze or silver player achieved 30 game win streak.
