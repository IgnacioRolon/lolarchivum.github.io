My account was even flagged in the past for calling someone &quot;kid&quot;, that is a common term many gamers use across many games.\n\nSure, my account hasn&#039;t been the friendliest lately, but this game is rated **T** not **E** according to the game's ESRB rating. If people want buttered up words they should be playing a \"My Little Pony\" game not this. \n\nSo to anyone that has control over deciding if a flag has merit, get the stick out of your bums and let words like &quot;kid&quot; and &quot;entitled&quot; through because there is nothing life threatening about such words when referring to other players.\n\nHave a nice day.","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2017-09-02T15:26:44.179+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"The game is rated T for content.

That definition comes from the community itself as the IFS adapts to what people choose to report (or not report, as the case may be). Interestingly enough, as recently as a year ago, \"KYS\" was given a low rating by the IFS, but now it triggers a ban pretty quickly.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Selegun","date":"2017-09-02T15:34:00.172+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No chat logs?
