Unfortunately, its Riot's own problem that is causing me to bug splat. Or perhaps its the windows 10 update. BUT ITS NOT MY FAULT! but since I keep disconnecting, which pisses me off beyond belief, I have now been put in the leave buster penalty box. \r\n\r\nWhy doesn't Leave buster communicate with bug splat. You are unfairly punishing people.\r\n\r\nPlease respond.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-08T15:44:34.116+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even though your leaving is not intentional, [leaverbuster](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ) will treat all leaves equally because it still causes everyone else a negative experience for being down a player.  If you are having bugsplats and crashes, I highly recommend going through our [game crash](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes+) guide to make sure your drivers and game files are in order.  If it is due to the Windows 10 update, disable the [Xbox Game Bar](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html) which has been causing freezing issues.  Good luck!","replies":[{"poster":"Skewir","date":"2016-10-08T16:23:08.422+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks, I did everything you suggested. Nothing worked. \n\nThe leave buster rational is understandable, but why punish me when I am not intentionally leaving. Like anyone who was affected knows I was having this issue and I am sure they would agree to not punish for this circumstance.

If you know you are having issues that can cause you to leave the game, it's not fair to everyone else in the game who could potentially lose a member.
