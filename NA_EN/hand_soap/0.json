Is there any way riot could set up something so that people who crash dont get punished for it?\r\nI would like to state that this has only happened in champ select so i never turned any game into a 4v5. Also my computer and internet are both good, this only started happening recently, internet runs smoothly before crashes and and after starting the client back up after crashes.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-16T22:52:30.364+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'd like to gather some more information to try and find out what's happening.  Are you receiving any errors like bug splat?  Is this happening while the game is trying to load, during champion select itself, or in-game?  Any additional information on this can help me find a solution for you.  \n\nRegarding the leaverbuster, all leaves are treated equally because it still causes players a negative experience.  The only way to remove it is by playing consistently without any interruptions to return to good standing.  I hope that helps and I look forward to working this out with you!","replies":[{"poster":"Hand Soap","date":"2016-07-16T23:09:21.112+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It isnt a bugsplat error, it happens during champ select when i either pick or ban a champion. the client suddenly freezes and says its not responding. Recently it crashed while i was opening a chest as well. Also this has all happened within the last week or so and as far as i can tell both my computer and internet are working completely fine. The client works fine before and after crashes. Also, for leaverbuster, does it still count as negative even if its not during the game and im not turning it into a 4v5?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-16T23:23:01.211+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The lower priority queue you may be experiencing is a result of [queue dodging](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751844-Queue-Dodging), which is similar but occurs in champion select.
