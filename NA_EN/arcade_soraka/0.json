Idk how you guys think about it but I think\r\nthis is a little too much. The reason that i&#039;m really salty about it is that like everybody gets chatristrictions,\r\nand i&#039;m talking about people that are telling ppl to kill themselves or even worse.

If this caused a permanent ban, then I imagine the account has been punished before. If you don't show proper reform in between punishments, the next punishment will escalate according to the following list:\n\n* 10-game chat restriction.\n* 25-game chat restriction.\n* 14-day ban.\n* Permanent ban.\n\nThis behavior is definitely punishable, and, depending on the history of the account, that could mean this results in a justified permanent ban.\n\n>The reason that i'm really salty about it is that like everybody gets chatristrictions,\n\nThis is actually quite inaccurate. Most players (I believe it was at least 80%-85%, but I don't have my source handy) never get *any* punishment. Most players who *get* a chat restriction never get *another* punishment.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fegone","date":"2018-05-06T23:18:30.981+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sooooo you got punished before (I assume, I would be surprised if you hadn't) and yet, you continue to be toxic af?\nClearly you didn't learn a thing.

Permaban\n\nThe system punishes people based on consistency x severity.  So someone that is mildly toxic for 1000 games will likely have the same punishment as another whom told others to kys for 2 games.\n\nHe likely wasn't just banned for this game alone. The reform card shows 1-5 recent games as examples of unacceptable behavior.\n\nWhen your bf had a 14-day ban, it was clearly written in the reform card that his next punishment would be a permaban.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2018-05-06T21:46:02.745+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=L9 Toxicity,realm=EUW,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=uvRM1OsR,comment-id=,timestamp=2018-05-06T20:16:04.154+0000)\n>\n>Little too much for me, People who like  tell others to\n> kill themselves get a chatrestrictio?
