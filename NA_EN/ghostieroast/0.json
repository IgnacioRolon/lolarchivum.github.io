The comments are disabled for the post I have a question about or I would have asked this there. \r\nOn the &ldquo;Looking for Game&rdquo; board, the rules say this:\r\n&ldquo;Do not include race, religion, gender, sexual orientation or other personally discriminating requirements not related to the game in the title or body of your post. Creepy and inappropriate or mature posts will be subject to removal (i.e. Do not post for &ldquo;egirls&rdquo; and &ldquo;sugar daddies&rdquo;); recruitment threads are for playing League of Legends only.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nI totally understand the second part. No one wants creepy posts. BUT as a female looking to find other females to play League with (just because I am hoping to find some new League friends and I&rsquo;m more comfortable actually talking to other females, especially on voice chat) I don&rsquo;t understand what would be offensive about a post looking for other girls to make friends and play with??\r\n\r\nI&rsquo;m not saying I refuse to play with guys, because I don&rsquo;t. I have a handful of people I play with regularly that are guys. So this is not a matter of &ldquo;discrimination&rdquo;.","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2018-10-08T12:23:25.615+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey there, GhostieRoast!\n\nSo this is a tricky one, because we specifically can't confirm someone's intent on the boards, nor do we want a world where people have to find ways to verify their identity to get exceptions for specific posts. So it's not that there is anything remotely *offensive* about making such a post -- it's more than when we allow that, we pretty much have to then allow all \"looking for X gender\" posts, because we can't go through and tell which ones are legitimate reasons such as yours. Given that we had a lot of fairly discriminatory or sketchy posts that were the basis for creating this rule, it's a situation I'm wary of creating exceptions for, even when well intended.\n\nNow, there's nothing wrong with saying \"I'm more comfortable talking to other females\" in a thread looking for players in general but, for reasons stated above, we unfortunately have to draw a line somewhere, and the \"do not include race, religion, gender, sexual orientation or other personally discriminating requirements not related to the game in the title or body of your post\" line is the most reasonably enforceable, even though, yes, it does have edge cases that are no doubt frustrating.","replies":[{"poster":"GhostieRoast","date":"2018-10-09T12:24:02.524+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thank you so much for the reply.
