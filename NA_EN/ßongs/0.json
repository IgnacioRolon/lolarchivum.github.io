During champion select the enemy pick time goes to 0, I sit there for a minute or two and then I'm back into lobby saying I DODGED. Riot pays for shit servers then when people disconnect because they don't want to put forth a nickel for a good server we are penalized for it. This game has so many errors and Riot would rather make new champions then fix them. Their thought process is \"Why spend money on fixing things when we could release a new champion and skins and make money?\" It sucks and I really wish they cared about the people who play their game..","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-05-24T21:12:29.212+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I've been in that exact situation before and definitely understand how much it sucks since it automatically counts as a loss in your series.  Keep in mind that if it was the PvP.net Servers fault, then all 10 players of the game would have been dropped or experienced this particular issue.  Since it appears that you were the only one, we need to look at the connection between your computer and the PvP.net Servers.  This is not to say the issue is on your end, but we need to start narrowing down the root cause.  In an effort to make sure this doesn't happen again, make sure to run through all of the steps in our [Connection Issues Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664)!  It has a lot of steps, but they are the most common solutions to make sure you maintain a stable connection to our PvP.net Servers\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!","replies":[{"poster":"Crys3s","date":"2016-05-24T21:21:56.751+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"On a similar note, the Chicago transfer effects are still felt.

So Riot's responsibility extends past your servers into your peering network as well.  If there is an issue in this private peering network you guys contracted with ISPs for you should accept responsibility.  I know that it is nearly impossible for you to know if the issue is with my PC, my hone network, my connection until I hit your network, or something on your side of the fence, but realize saying \"the servers are fine\" is a little bit of a cop-out.\n\nGW","replies":[]}]}]}
