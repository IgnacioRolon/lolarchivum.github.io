If I attempt to load before then I will an error saying I have a network problem and I've been disconnected. I don't believe that to be the case as once I'm actually in game I don't have any problems with lag or ping... Has anyone else run into this? Any ideas on how to fix it?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-23T19:03:19.092+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You seem to be having some pretty big connection issues that's preventing you from promptly reaching the game server.  It's good that your connection while in game is good, but it may deteriorate in time if this keeps up.  I recommend going through the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to speed up your connection to the game and prevent a weakening state.  I hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
