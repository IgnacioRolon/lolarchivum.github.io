Trying to leave silver before the 7th","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi guys, \r\n\r\nThis is my first time here of the forums, and **I was just wondering if anyone knew where I can get someone to coach me?** I know that there are websites that advertise boosting, but I disagree with that. I really would like to improve, and I know of a few things that I should improve on (map awareness and staying in the laning phase too long). \r\n\r\nAlso, I don't to sound like every silver player ever, but (at least for the last 10-15 games maybe 20) I have been dying  minimally (TYPICALLY), getting a lot of kills and focusing on objectives. I don't chase kills, I farm under tower when I know I'm behind, I don't play a multitude of champions, and I have pretty good overall game knowledge. \r\n\r\nI tend to duo queue with my friends, but they tend to not do as well as me. I really do enjoy playing with them, but I'm starting to almost feel as though it's a guaranteed loss. \r\n\r\nI'm at a loss here because I know for sure that there are many ways that I can improve, but I cannot seem to gain Lp (just got demoted to Silver 3, first demotion yet). Today was the last straw for me to try and improve based on my own ideas. I watch YouTube videos and actively try and improve but I would really love a \"coach\" or someone who can view 1/2 of my games in order to help me.\r\n\r\n_If any of you know where I can get a service like this, or if there is a community that does this (preferably for free but not solely) I would appreciate it immensely!_\r\n\r\n(Last game: 8/2/2 with most cs (235) @32 minutes LOSS\r\ngame before that:  8/4/7 9 farm below most (241) @ 35 minutes LOSS\r\nBefore that: 8/7/4 with 140 at 29 LOSS (was roaming to help very not-so-great bot lane)\r\nIn all of these games I ended up doing the best on the team, objective wise, warding, dmg, dmg taken, gold, cs. I don't want to seem like I am crying about this, but I am seriously looking for some help (I can provide more examples at any time).\r\n\r\nThank you very much, \r\nChase {{champion:50}}","replies":[{"poster":"usul1202","date":"2017-10-24T19:45:47.440+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The subreddit [summoner school](https://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/) is dedicated to helping players get better for free, I would highly recommend spending some time there, asking for an op.gg review in the simple questions simple answers thread maybe.","replies":[{"poster":"Chasadilla","date":"2017-10-24T23:23:23.342+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh sweet!
