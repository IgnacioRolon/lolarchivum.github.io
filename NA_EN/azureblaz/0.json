I've been stuck at 974RP forever, and the options in the store are only multiples of 5 now... So I just left it.\r\n\r\nThen Warring Kingdoms Katarina came out.\r\n\r\nI instantly fell in love with the skin and the splash art, so I decided to make a tribute to the beautiful splash art, in exchange for 1 RP. Disclaimer, I am NOT an artist by ANY means whatsoever. Just some guy who had a pencil and paper and a couple hours to kill. Riot, I'm counting on you so I can rep my favorite Noxian assassin in all of her Warring Kingdoms glory.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-02-13T18:32:17.841+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nicely done! \n\nPlayer Support would be the ones to ask for the 1RP. :] \n\nYou can ask them by submitting a ticket [here](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).","replies":[]},{"poster":"DWT12345","date":"2015-02-13T01:25:37.674+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"send a ticket in to riot with this","replies":[]},{"poster":"AzureBlaz","date":"2015-02-13T03:51:57.185+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"...What's a ticket?","replies":[{"poster":"Kaipop","date":"2015-02-13T12:56:17.822+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=AzureBlaz,realm=NA,application-id=2XjzURgc,discussion-id=yzV1o90z,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2015-02-13T03:51:57.185+0000)\n>\n> ...What's a ticket?\n\nA support ticket.
