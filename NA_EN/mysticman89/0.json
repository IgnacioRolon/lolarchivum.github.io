Is it the 28 day expiry since during the series you are still a platinum player, and so in that sense it's a plat series, or is it the 5 day expiry rule since it's a promotion series to diamond, and so it's a diamond series?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-27T21:48:47.883+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You should have 28 days to complete your series before it expires while Platinum 1.
