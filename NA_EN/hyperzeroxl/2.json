We won? oh good zilean didn't hold us back that much.

You can't only be good at literally only a single champion (especially someone like Shaco) in a Ranked game, what if your team needs an ADC? In this case, while you probably shouldn't play Shaco if your team lacks an initiator, you owe it to your team to atleast pick a bulkier champion at the very least. Or someone capable of making picks. Or atleast not a champion in a class that is the complete opposite that your team needs.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot 10YearSanta","date":"2014-11-17T06:30:50.922+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":3,"body":"> One of you purely wants to benefit the team at the detriment to your own FUN, while the other completely neglects the needs of the TEAM in a TEAM game.\n> \n> If you're not having fun, chances are you're not very great with your champion you're forced to play (hence why I rarely play Support, that role's a piss off).\n\nYou've got this core assumption that playing what you know how to play is about fun, which I never said or implied.
