Junglers were optional, and 2 person top lanes were actually optimal - you had to pick only certain characters if your team had a jungler on it, because it was likely you would be stuck 1v2.  \r\n\r\nAD carries could go to any lane and didn&#039;t have to be babysat by a dedicated role.  Ashe and Sivir mid were common - Ashe especially because of her global ult.  Twitch was also a common mid because of his roam potential with stealth and was very scary once he hit six.\r\n\r\nBot lane was a wildcard because people would tend to go for things like Taric/Sion to chain stun, or Blitz/Ali for pinballing champs.  But any two champs could go together as long as they complemented each other.\r\n\r\nThe whole &#039;sit in bush for 10 minutes, don&#039;t take any farm, don&#039;t take any kills, and don&#039;t earn any gold&#039; came about from Dreamhack in season 1, and is probably the one established thing that&#039;s remained constant since, and it&#039;s consistently been a problem to get people to actually want to play this role ever since.\r\n\r\nFor example, I love playing Janna and have since this game was in beta.  I hate being passive and feeling like I have zero impact on the game as a whole until teamfights break out, so I&#039;ve been taking her Mid and Top lane since season 1, so I can build her with AP and actually do things on my own as a &#039;support-only&#039; champion.\r\n\r\nWith things like morde/ziggs bot, it does change things a bit, but a lot more can be done to change it from specifically a &#039;support&#039; role, into just a dual bot lane role.  Old Karma, for example, was a great duo with Melee bot laners, and in Lux&#039;s original champ spotlight, she was meant to go together with melee bot laners as well.\r\n\r\nI normally do like the support role in other games because clutch saves are fun - but you become 100% reliant on your ally to be competent.  If you&#039;re Janna and you&#039;re laning with a first time Draven who can&#039;t CS, you might as well go AFK since you literally won&#039;t be able to do a thing to save your lane and stop the enemy team from snowballing.\r\n\r\nAfter the Support Singed w/ Smite fiasco, it became clear that deviating from this hard set meta not only gets your team pissed at you, but can even get you banned from the game completely.\r\n\r\nIf one thing could be done to really make this season stand out, it would be to change the role from Support and not force ADCs to only go bot lane, and allow so-called support champions to go to other lanes to potentially solo and earn money to charge their abilities.  After the support rework in season 4, AP is actually very impactful on champs like Sona/Janna/Soraka and playing Janna with 500 AP is extremely fun and satisfying.\r\n\r\nBeing able to do this without automatically being deemed a troll would be nice, and we would likely have a lot more players who would play these characters if they weren&#039;t 100% reliant on someone else doing well.","replies":[{"poster":"Çhåryzård","date":"2017-01-05T05:29:45.616+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't really think you can get rid of a role that many people now main and have mained for years","replies":[{"poster":"dakota saturn","date":"2017-01-05T05:33:03.319+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Charyzard,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=WiK8ZyEF,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2017-01-05T05:29:45.616+0000)\n>\n> I don&#x27;t really think you can get rid of a role that many people now main and have mained for years\n\nWhy not?  nothing stops people from still playing those champions.

Some people would say they climbed being only support but there is an issue if you think everyone will only play only support. The time is divided if you play multiple champions.
