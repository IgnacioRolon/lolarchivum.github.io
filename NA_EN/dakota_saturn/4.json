Tell me how the FK to play this pile of trash at this point.\n\nAshe was just healing up through the whole thing - If you&#039;re nurturing the root, you&#039;re in range of ADC&#039;s AAs.  The second an ADC picks up a vamp scepter, you're done.  Oh, and you can't duel their APC either because they'll stun you and nuke you in .2 seconds.  \n\nAs for what you're supposed to do in a match at this point?  Got me!  Oh, sorry, I mean YOU'RE NOT BEING DECEIIIVING ENOUGH GET GUD.  Yeah.\n\nAnd since her dmg is so delayed, it takes even longer to get below 40% to trigger Morello's, making it all but impossible to take out anyone with healing / lifesteal / soraka support/ sona support / heal summoner spell / potions / near honeyfruit / etc etc etc.\n\nKeep downvoting people that say she&#039;s horrible.  If a fed ~~assassin~~, I mean _super cool deceiver mage_ can't duel an ADC out of position, PLEASE TELL ME WHAT GOOD THEY ARE.

So the delay makes it exponentially more difficult because lifesteal will have more time to keep champs healthy during LB's burst.  God help LB if they have a Hexdrinker too.\n\nFor pre-rework, LB would have no problem doing her job right there.  According to Riot, they want more counterplay and more interaction.

Ashe completely misplayed that fight and still won.  I did my job of 'deceiving' against a class where it's my JOB to control them, and she can't even do that.\n\nIs LB only supposed to go in once someone else CC's a target?

Or a lower cooldown et ceteria. For more usage of clone. Again tweaking/number tweaking all can occur during preseason. Its similiar to how they made Jinx's rockets amazingly clunky during the preseason update but fixed it over dozens of patches to make them less clunky. Likely if leblanc needs work on her kit they will fix it during the preseason. If it is not a major issue then they will eventually fix after 9 months which is how long it took riot to fix jin's clunkiness.","replies":[{"poster":"Erockandroll","date":"2016-11-11T06:39:11.946+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Geshultz,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=0kcVh8v4,comment-id=000100000000,timestamp=2016-11-11T06:06:58.153+0000)\n>\n> Actually they can easy program her clone to have HP and have functionality if needed.

Her win rate may increase in a weeks time. Numbers tweak or otherwise. \n\nThe video show a fairly low understanding of how her kit might have worked. What point was their to make your clone go strait for her, and then follow right behind that clone. If anything, you and the clone should be coming from different fronts. Besides, you did manage to get your full combo off, and it was almost enough, but ultimately you picked a fight with a Full health target with a BT overshield. And you could have recalled to your W starting position if things did get that sour, but you just stood their. \n\nShe may have lost some of the self reliance she once had, (makes sense since riot enjoys when teams highlight their teammates strengths.) Her deception can trick people into thinking she's ganking when she isn't.

Since her clones are tied to her ult - it's going to be on CD when she needs it most - escaping.  And the RR clone won't work at all if her regular R is on CD, even if RR is up.\n\nBasically, the only time she actually -NEEDS- her deception abilities is when they're on CD - after she's done her burst and needs to get away.","replies":[{"poster":"Geshultz","date":"2016-11-11T06:12:12.430+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=dakota saturn,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=0kcVh8v4,comment-id=0001000000000000,timestamp=2016-11-11T06:10:16.492+0000)\n>\n> A big thing LB lost with this update is juking potential.

My point is that they can do a decent quantity of things to make her kit currently how it is more smoother for the user/reliable for escaping. Similar to how bruisers use defensive items as a tool to survive. They can tweak the tools to be more reliable/less reliable for each assassins or grant other qualities within the kit that she had not before(Wave clear, cheaper mana costs in a trade off for less reliable burst)","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2016-11-11T06:27:30.811+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Assassins are useless now pretty much.
