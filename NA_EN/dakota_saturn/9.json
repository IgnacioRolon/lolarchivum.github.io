Lee -has- to snowball since he becomes garbage late game once people group, like most assassins do.  Hecarim loves late game, and derptrain express Vi can point and click any carry late game like old Poppy and explode them with zero counterplay or anything.  Also, if Lee falls out of favor, Shaco is likely going to replace him as the go-to high skillcap early game champion.  Nobody likes Shaco.  I find him far more tilting and frustrating than Lee.\n\nThe thing is - a lot of these strong junglers have unavoidable point and click abilities that can&#039;t be countered in any way.  If the Vi flashes in range and presses R, you are going to be CC&#039;d without any chance of retaliating, avoiding it, or anything.\n\nThere are far more oppressive junglers than Lee... Imagine if {{champion:9}} became meta and you saw him every single game.  Unavoidable point-and-click fear that you can do nothing to avoid, and massive AoE late game.  If you are warding and see Lee coming, you can flash out of his Q range and then he can&#039;t do anything.\n\nYou can outplay Lee - he is strong for sure, it is frustrating as fk to get camped by him early game, but there is actual counterplay to him.  There is no counterplay to press R -&gt; Click champion -&gt; HUAAAAA UHHHH {{champion:254}} .  Be careful what you wish for.\n\n\n\ndownvotes inc\n\nhttps://images.moviepilot.com/image/upload/v1426603959/jan-20-years-later-the-brady-bunch-movie-cast-is-still-groovy-gif-289767.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"IA9hRfpP5q","date":"2017-01-12T18:27:16.895+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:254}} cant be countered.","replies":[{"poster":"Canastus","date":"2017-01-12T18:33:00.377+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This man got it right, her current winrate also reflects that quite well.
