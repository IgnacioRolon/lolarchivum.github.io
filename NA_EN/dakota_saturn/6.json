What about lanes telling you about enemies {{summoner:4}} {{summoner:7}} {{summoner:14}} etc ? \n  Who CARES.  When your teammates tell you the enemies summs their wanting ganks instantly nothing else, and does anyone notice the player who says \" top no flash or Ignite etc\" there DEAD so they just want ganks at that point because they got ganked or solo killed and they cant win their lane now without dying 24/7 because they cant farm under tower or miss 3-4 cs to not overextend. \n  They don't keep up with the timers of the Flahes,TP,Ignite, heal etc mainly the TP and Flash, so just go into each game with the mentality that the enemy team players still have their flashes or summs.

I don't have time to waste talking to them about s$it that doesn't matter at the end of the day.  I die teammate says \"Why\" or \" you suck\" yep I died or another teammate died it happens MOVE ON.  \n     Ever played a game mainly in botlane where your the support or adc but try to remember playing as the support and you dominate the lane and give 10-15 kills to the ADC and you win the game and at the end of the game your ADC says \" Best support EVER! You did great, GJ, Nice, honored!\" 2-3 games later you play with that same player in the the same roles and lane but they don't remember you and vice versa.  You lose lane and the game ever notice that same player who played with you 2-3 games before will say \" Kill yourself, you suck, uninstall, etc\" So you get the same generic answers over and over and over again.  You win \" you're great, GJ etc etc\" You Lose \" you suck, garabge\" makes 0 sense not to mute EVERYONE and once the game is over don't respond in the end game chat, NOTHING YOU SAY TO THEM ON WHY U DID WHAT YOU DID in game will click to them because YOU'RE WRONG AND THEIR RIGHT 100% of the TIME PERIOD.","replies":[{"poster":"Hrd2H1t","date":"2016-10-15T03:06:31.478+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"The chat is incredibly valuable for relaying complex information.

I already explained that people in norms are chill, the experience is more laid back and people are nicer.\n\nMy post is directed towards a ranked game, where you seem to assume people are logical and can be reasoned with.  They are not and can not.  If someone spams \"WHY WHY WHY WHY *ping* *ping* *ping*\", there is nothing you can say.  They don't want you to say \"well, I saw the Trist up top, and I figured that the Janna would be alone, so..\", No, they don't want to hear that, they just want to flame and insult you.\n\nLast game, I was mid, had a Kha sitting in the bush.  I was completely OOM and he kept pinging Ahri who was turret hugging.  I pinged him back, I pinged that my mana was gone and couldn't use any abilities.  I pinged to PLEASE not fight her.  I typed 'b' over and over in chat.\n\nDid that stop him from turret diving an Ahri, eating charm, and giving her double buffs, ruining my lane, then flaming me for not flashing over 2 minion waves and autoing her under tower?  Nope.  Did it stop him from wandering around the enemy jungle at half HP, no wards, and everyone MIA?  Nope.  Did that stop him from throwing the rest of the game and purposely going in 1v5 because he was mad?  Nope.  Was there -anything- I could have done to salvage that game once he started throwing a tantrum for his own mistake?  Nope.\n\nThe people in this game at lower elo are garbage - they are in that elo BECAUSE of their inability to reason or work as a team.  You're toting 'aw just politely pls ask them to stop', and its ridiculous.  You can't reason with a raging 13 year old who giggles while he runs down mid for the 13th time.  You can't reason with a racist who just wants to spam obscenities in chat.  You can't reason with someone spam pinging the \"?\" on you for 15 solid minutes.  And you certainly can't carry them if they go out of their way to feed and throw because of them making bad decisions and blaming others for them.\n\nAlso, people are not only toxic when they are losing.  People are just toxic for the sake of being toxic.  Even if your team is ahead in ever way, people will find a way to insult you and throw the game over something ridiculous like taking red buff from adc or ks'ing from Riven.  I've had games where the support took a single cs from lane 25 min in, when we were leading, they just said 'stole cs bye' and quit for the rest of the game.  So no, people are not toxic only when losing.\n\nIf you try to be polite and communicate like a reasonable human being, you will be frustrated and disappointed over and over and over, and will eventually come to the conclusion that doing so is a waste of time.  Time that could be spent trying to carry and win the game.  Typing and communicating in this game leads to loss if you're anything lower than plat, almost guaranteed.","replies":[{"poster":"Yrzen","date":"2016-10-15T08:13:03.333+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did you only read the first line or something?\n\nPerhaps it's my OCD, but I like reporting people and purging League of assholes bit by bit.

Even if they got punished and perma banned after one game of toxicity, this game has 80,000 others that will happily take their place and ruin more games.\n\nI know that bans and restrictions happen, but even after all the years of tribunal and bans, people still troll and flame incessantly.\n\nBans and punishments don't really work.","replies":[{"poster":"Yrzen","date":"2016-10-15T23:44:48.796+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Bans and Punishments don't work.

Its why I don&#x27;t play ranked.\n\nAgain I'm not discussing normal games.  They are vastly different - like you say, people joke, people are laid back, people just play for fun.  Troll builds are common but it's fine - it's an agreement that the game will be a chill experience because nothing will be gained or lost at the end of the day.\n\nHowever, when you try to make it a goal to raise your skill level so you can get past the point where people are just awful and make the worst decisions, and those same awful teammates decide to flame everyone, making everyone focus on typing instead of playing, the game is over.\n\nHonestly, once the flaming begins, I just want to ff20 and go afk until the game ends.  Teamwork at that point is done, coordination is done, and the chance of winning has dropped to less than 10%.  It doesn't matter how fed you are.  It doesn't matter how good you are.  Once your team decides to act like jackasses and flame and troll, the game is over and there is nothing you can do about it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Immortal spax","date":"2016-10-15T08:59:17.489+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Idk why you got downvoted, you just spoke the truth.","replies":[{"poster":"dakota saturn","date":"2016-10-15T18:17:34.271+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Truth always = downvotes.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"willcutt","date":"2016-10-15T07:22:03.180+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"your level 18 what do you mean ranked games?","replies":[{"poster":"dakota saturn","date":"2016-10-15T07:38:10.401+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not stupid enough to use my game account on the forums where I can have it affected/punished because of people who had their feelings hurt by an opinion on a forum.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"xxxDogmanxxx","date":"2016-10-15T06:43:25.008+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No need to mute everyone, just mute the Yasuo, Riven, and/or whichever Gosu-wannabe is playing your ADC.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CrazyBear1987","date":"2016-10-15T04:16:22.602+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe you should, until you can get a team on Discord that you can communicate with, until then you are right, the toxic behaviour that can occur on boths sides shouldn't be forced upon you.","replies":[{"poster":"dakota saturn","date":"2016-10-15T05:42:25.263+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If anything Voice Chat is worse - at least in chat you can ignore it and let it go or mute them pre-emptively as I've chosen to do.\nIn voice chat, they'll just outright say 'why the fk did you do that?' and you have to respond because you're on a phone call with said jerks/morons, waste time, pay less attention to the game, get tilted bc flamers etc etc.","replies":[{"poster":"CrazyBear1987","date":"2016-10-15T05:47:49.353+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Find friends, not Rando's","replies":[{"poster":"dakota saturn","date":"2016-10-15T06:04:53.166+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Until I hit mid-plat, there's nobody I've met that I'd care to play with ever again.","replies":[{"poster":"CrazyBear1987","date":"2016-10-15T06:28:20.200+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"fair enuff","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Lapis","date":"2016-10-14T23:46:48.897+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is what I do every game, but announcing it seems unnecessary.
