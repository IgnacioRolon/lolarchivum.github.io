It's a different playstyle from Janna/Nami.\n\nIt's not much different from Brand/Annie/Vel'Koz support - she has about 3.5 ap scalings, so it really doesn't take a lot for her to burst the adc.","replies":[{"poster":"I hate my ADC","date":"2016-11-02T22:15:14.444+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is far different from Brand/Annie/Vel'Koz support.\n\nBrand and Vel'Koz have passive that give them a lot of free % health damage without the need for levels or items. Zyra, another mage support, just have super high base damage due to her plants.\nAnnie has higher attack range than the majority of ADCs and supports, this is the main reason why she is actually viable as a support, because she has high base harass in early game due to her auto attacks setting her danger zone higher than the enemy, reducing her dependence to level and items in the early game. Losing your lane as an Annie support is pretty much making you completely worthless for the rest of the game however.\n\nLeblanc doesn't have either of those. She scales on levels and items. A support is almost always going to be the lowest level on their team and without the base damage from Leblanc spells and no items for her scaling, her damage will absolutely not be dangerous against any competent bot lane.\n\nI've played my share of mage support in normals, I don't play them in ranked because I'd rather stick with a style I am more familiar with and when I need AP damage, I go for Sona instead.\nI've fought all sort of support, even saw someone try to play Vayne support. I'm not talking out of my ass when I'm saying Leblanc wouldn't be a good support. You can support with any champion and win, doesn't make them good at support, just means you won your game. There are a thousand reasons why you would win a game.\n\nI've got Mastery 7 on Taliyah from playing Support Taliyah in normals. Doesn't mean I consider Taliyah to be good as a Support. Taliyah is too dependent on getting an early Rylai and suffer from her scaling if she goes support.\n\n\nAnd regarding the whole \"Burst the ADC\". It does take a lot to burst an ADC in bot lane when you aren't snowballing. The ADC has Summoner Heal and the enemy support is usually carrying around Exhaust or has defensive abilities like shields, heals or other ways to prevent damage done to its ADC.\nIt is actually MUCH harder to kill an opponent in a two-man lane than in a one-man lane. Because in a two man lane, you always have to put yourself in danger when trying to engage. And let's just say that... a Leblanc isn't exactly the hardest thing to kill. If you dash in to attack, you may find yourself pinned to a wall by a Vayne, stunned by a Leona or simply bursted down by a Caliber net and a Power Chord Q.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Romtheguy","date":"2016-11-02T12:38:02.377+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let's not forget LeBlanc's base damages either.\nJust enough to scare away or outright kill.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"EcchiOtakuTM","date":"2016-11-02T04:42:34.054+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Talon support>>>>>>LB support.","replies":[{"poster":"reaperteaser","date":"2016-11-02T04:48:16.196+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"new talon as sup means best wards ever!","replies":[{"poster":"EcchiOtakuTM","date":"2016-11-02T05:04:43.421+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually been building equinox not really an issue :P 6th slot always situational anyways.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Truly Prideful","date":"2016-11-02T04:09:27.244+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think you'd still get better results out of a Brand / Vel'koz / Annie pick.

Just my opinions on it.\n\nover all, most mage supports have a lot more CC than Le'blanc. Annie has a stun every 4th spell, Brand has a stun with his passive-Q combo, Vel'koz, has a slow and a knock up, While Le blanc really only has the snare, on a kinda unreliable tether. \n\nBecause of that, those mage supports tend to grab CDR, (increase damage and CC) and Support itemization is flushed with CDR options. But the other problem I would see with Le'blanc is mana problems. \n\nThe thing with the support role is, High damage output is never a reliable options, so if you planed on picking a damage oriented Support, it should be paired with some utility. Cause even if you fail to snowball, the utility is always helpful.","replies":[]},{"poster":"dakota saturn","date":"2016-11-02T04:26:39.442+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Solaire,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=oR9odRKd,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2016-11-02T04:09:27.244+0000)\n>\n> I think you&#x27;d still get better results out of a Brand / Vel&#x27;koz / Annie pick.

Just my opinions on it.\n\nIt's also more of a playstyle - Those 3 champs are immobile as can be, and if caught in a bad spot, they're dead 100%.  LB can make plays with her mobility and bait ppl into chasing her (happens all the time even in plat).  \n\nBursting the adc before 6 isn't 100-0, it's qw - adc is now 60%. w -> qe ignite w/ your adc follow up = dead.  With even a small lead, after lv 6, a qrwe combo will certainly 100-0 the enemy adc.  LB chain is a lot easier to land than a thresh/blitz grab or almost every other skillshot.  You can W right on top of them, chain, and blink back out of auto range but still in tether range.\n\nI've had pretty good success with it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Craft Zeppelin","date":"2016-11-02T04:17:00.107+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you dont need to support since you can spawn your ult randomly on bot and spiritually be there somehow lol","replies":[]}]}
