When I play with friends that are supporting me, they have often complained about one thing. \n\nWhen Kalista uses her ultimate the game locks the camera of the support player. This can be very disorienting, even when the ult is called beforehand. Oftentimes they are seeing the environment move quickly around them as their character model rushes towards mine. If the camera needs to be locked at all, I think it would make a lot more sense for the camera to be locked in Kalista's view. This would allow the support player ample time to see which targets are around Kalista and make the correct decision on which to knock up instead of the blur that they currently experience.\n\n How do others feel about Kalista's ult and the camera being locked? I would really like to hear the opinions of support mains that have played with Kalista. Would you prefer for the camera to be locked in her view or do you like how the camera currently locks on you? I feel like unlocking the camera entirely would be far superior to these options, but that may be a balancing issue, similar to Sion's ultimate.","replies":[{"poster":"GracelessHawk","date":"2015-01-11T06:19:24.496+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":3,"body":"I personally always have the Camera locked.
