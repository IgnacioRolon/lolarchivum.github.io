I always wanted to be better than both of them.. but one day.. one of their faces popped up in my League of Legends client :(\r\n\r\nhttps://fbcdn-sphotos-c-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xfa1/t31.0-8/10286729_10202850736568005_2920842890614284878_o.jpg\r\n\r\nAnd then he started popping up… on my Fantasy LCS teams. Other Rioters didn’t know if it was BM for them to draft him away from me (lol).\r\n\r\n**I want to hear your stories about your family and LoL! **League of Legends brought my family together to be closer than ever; we even attended Season 3 World Championships together (unfortunately for Hai, as a spectator) and met up at Season 4 World Championships (when his hair was a weird color).","replies":[{"poster":"TwistedWrist","date":"2015-01-13T22:50:29.627+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yep! My wife got me into LoL, and we still play together once in a while. Though she's much more into Twisted Treeline and Dominion than I am, but we still have a good time playing. \n\nMy son plays with me, and he's positively addicted to buying every new champ that comes out (and as many skins as I'll let him when I buy him RP). My daughter plays too, even though she doesn't really \"get\" the game. She loves to play support champs in customs, and has a blast in ARAMs as long as she can play Nidalee. \n\nLeague (and gaming in general) is very much a family thing for us. We play together, we watch LCS together, we named many of our pet rats after League of Legends characters.
