It is really distracting and if I ever accidentally click on it, it removes me from the game.\r\nDoes anyone know how to get rid of it?\r\nhttps://s1.postimg.org/i23ct9le5/image.png\r\n\r\nP.S. I tried going window mode yet the screen still goes below it and it even covers half the map.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-30T23:43:10.968+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There could be another program interfering with League, but toggling it off could help too.
