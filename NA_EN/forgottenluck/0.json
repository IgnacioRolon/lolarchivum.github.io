When Kusho was killed by Zed, the title of Eye of Twilight passed down to Shen. It's for this reason that he cannot enact revenge on Zed, as much as he wants to. He needs to maintain balance, and to take up on his revenge would be to imbalance both the natural order and himself.","replies":[{"poster":"ForgottenLuck","date":"2017-04-13T02:45:07.505+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you but that is not my question.

However the spirit realm is swamped with the essence of magic, so it would be more accurate to see them both as the same realm, you would be making a correct guess in that sense.\n\nJust like there is malevolent beings in the physical realm of Runeterra, it would stand to reason that there would be malevolent entities within the spirit realm. I believe that demons would be very, very loosely connected with the Vastaya, in the idea that their powers and such originated from the same place. \n\nDemons would appear to feed off of their prey. So they would hunt anything that they could reach, such as in Lux's short story. Nocturne was portrayed as a Demon who fed off peoples' fear by giving them horrifying nightmares. I think the prey to the demon makes no difference, Human or Vastaya. If Shen was aware, then it'd be most likely he would try his utmost protect the Vastaya from them, especially if they were innocent. It seems likely too, since in Xayah & Rakan's short story, the Kinkou Order seem to hold an agreement with the many Vastayan tribes.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Volttekka","date":"2017-04-12T19:12:58.776+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pretty sure that Xayah and Rakan just straight-up hate any Ionian","replies":[{"poster":"ForgottenLuck","date":"2017-04-12T19:17:41.769+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think its humans overall but I am trying to see what the story overall will lead us to","replies":[{"poster":"Volttekka","date":"2017-04-12T19:21:42.028+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They tend to look down on humans overall, but Rakan has nothing but nasty comments for Ionians","replies":[]}]}]}]}
