I am waiting in Queue and suddenly when I accept it, it kicks me off the home page and closes LOL completely.  I am wondering is there any reason to it?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-06T04:35:32.723+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're seeing the actual bugsplat screen pop up with an error, it might mean that some of the League files are damaged somehow. If that's the case, I'd suggest running a repair through the client options to make sure you have a fresh install of League to work with!","replies":[{"poster":"NinjaGuy69","date":"2017-06-06T04:38:54.018+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hope you enjoy reading this TL;DR I'm going to send your way tomorrow. You won't believe it, but I was actually transported (through the power of magic) to the LPL servers even though my account is based in NA.
