WW/Pantheon","subforum":"Report a Bug","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"Been having this bug happen with particularly Warwick and Pantheon where as after I use ultimate I am unable to use one of 3 skills.  The ultimate is completed and I'm running around trying to use my W or Q and nothing happens. This drastically interrupts game play and has cost me many fights. It isn't an every time occurrence however it is really annoying.  It takes either disengaging or sometimes switching targets for it to work, also may be a time issue about 5-10 seconds to be fixed.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Exgeniar","date":"2014-09-25T22:06:44.043+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for the report!","replies":[{"poster":"Final 5partan","date":"2014-10-08T02:26:59.685+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why was pantheon ninja nerfed","replies":[]},{"poster":"xSatanx","date":"2014-10-06T04:07:30.546+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"please fix soon, i main both these champs and it continues to happen","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2014-09-25T20:50:26.994+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have witnessed this as well.

It's pretty annoying but not game-breaking. As for Warwick I'm pretty sure it's if you cast Q while in the Ult animation it'll be used but the timer won't go as well. These are low priority fixes but I hope they get some attention by someone.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jhaie","date":"2014-10-08T17:23:55.945+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have  experienced this with fiddlesticks also.","replies":[]}]}
