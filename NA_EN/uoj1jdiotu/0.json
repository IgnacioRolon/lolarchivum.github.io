If not for all champs skins then at least for Ultimate skins. When I play Spirit Guard Udyr, it kinda annoys me to see his default portrait on the minimap, especially as it was so expensive.\n\nAnyone else like to see this feature implemented?

And I can imagine a few things to address your concerns:\n\n* Skin portraits could be only visible to the player (client side)\n* There are currently only 2 Ultimate skins, you could implement a \"did you know\" during the load screen to make all players aware that the map portrait is different (also doubles as advertising selling the new feature of ultimate skins for those who don't follow league news)\n* toggle as Failbot Deploy suggested\n\nThere may be more solutions that thw community can provide!

So, that excuse isn't valid. (What if they are color-blind? That's what color-blind mode is for...) I mean, my map awareness is decent at best. There are often times where I'll catch a glimpse of a different colored portrait border sneaking past a ward. I didn't have enough time to be sure exactly who it was but I know someone from the enemy team is in our jungle. You really don't need the best of attention to figure out there is an extra enemy nearby.","replies":[{"poster":"MackleDoge","date":"2014-06-17T22:58:20.964+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm aware it isn't a valid excuse.

Readability is most important when it comes to gameplay aspects, and the minimap is probably the most if not one of the most important things about League's HUD. Whether you're a new player or a veteran, getting confused by the skin portrait instead of the regular portrait can be the difference between turning a gank into a double, and getting your ass handed to you. We have certain expectations, and consistency is key to this game.\n\nTL;DR I like cool fancy things like this, but not if it sacrifices gameplay.
