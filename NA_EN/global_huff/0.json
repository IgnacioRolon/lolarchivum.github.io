They change attitudes and philosophies on a week by week basis based on the current outcry **completely reactive** and never _proactive _. Everything is just a undirected maelstrom of ideas being added then removed and reworked. THEY LITERALLY DO NOT HAVE A DIRECTION ANYMORE. NOBODY HAS A STRONG VISION OF WHAT THEY WANT LEAGUE OF LEGENDS TO BE. THERE IS NO GRAND VISION WITH A CAPABLE ARCHITECT WORKING TO ACCOMPLISH IT.\n\nRiot  just adds and remove and adds and removes completely winging it as they go hoping that maybe...just MAYBE if they put enough content into a single patch, that next yasuo/jhin level champion or enough ranked matchmaking changes (lmfao)the playerbase in the west will recover completely and they will once again take the gaming scene by force as the days of old.\n\n\n**NOW HERES WHAT I REALLY THINK.**\nWHAT I TRULY THINK. Is that it is far too late for League to ever \"recapture\" the golden years and huge success lightning in a bottle of what it once was and for the most part League is approaching its shelf life (we had a good run folks damn good run compared to most other games).\nWhat riot needs to focus on now is not LC$ or some silly advertising campaign trying to disguise LoL as a social hub for people to gather around(le CLASH with ur buddies!\").\n\nWhat Riot needs to focus on now more than ever is KEEPING the current playerbase they have left(its a decent chunk).\nFocusing all efforts towards making the game as ENJOYABLE and least frustrating as possible so that people continue to log on,play and buy those price-creeped skins w limited edition loading borders.\n\nThats all I want and its all I've EVER Wanted since Season5.\nSTOP releasing a new champion every 3 months when you cant even properly balance and find a niche for the other half of your current 141 champs (Camille retiring Fiora. Kai'Sa retiring Vayne).\nSTART working on bringing older champions up to the same level as newer champions and fixing the gameplay,voice and visuals.\nSOLVE your itemization pain points and make sure that all manners of builds and champions are properly supported even off-meta builds for off meta champions.\n\nnow the truth of this all that Riot will have to come to terms with is that **THERE IS NOT A LOT OF PROFIT TO BE MADE IN DOING THIS BUT IT MUST BE DONE IF YOU WANT LONGEVITY.**\nIt will be financially painful but if you want a shot at actually SURVIVING and not becoming the next Heroes of Newerth you've gotta bite the bullet..\n","replies":[{"poster":"Asobi Spirit","date":"2018-07-23T22:38:11.939+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":2,"body":"Great statements.

Not everyone buys skins or rune pages. With the previous rune system I managed to get my 2 pages set for which playstyle I felt liked and didnt need em. I wasnt one to buy LCS logos or those weird master chests. That's lost profit. Sure I bought skins for champions I like but that totals to maybe 80 bucks. Imagine an Esports sponsor, (note I'm talking out my ass here) say Monster offers league a multi million dollar sponsorship for having players drink their product on broadcast since LCS was popular. That's big money, money that they can use to develop cool play modes, hire better artists for skin designs, produce music videos to promote League. That can get new blood in the game, say maybe 1000 for easy numbers. Say they are all like me and spend $80 on things they like. That's $80000, significantly less money for profit and development.  If they catered to our every wish and balanced the game for fun gameplay to the average player which may result in less 'exciting' LCS matches which lowers its popularity and causes a loss in sponsors.\n\nSo then it becomes a labor of love deal, and not everyone pursues that cause they need to eat and pay bills. What if they made no money on League at all? Unlikely I know but stay with me.No sponsors and no paying customers buying their stupid boxes or RP? Then they cant afford to keep servers running and they die that way. We who enjoy the game are heart broken cause they went out of business.\n\nSome of that touched on what you said but now I'll touch on your reply. I dislike EA too. They turned NSF into lootbox hell. I'm not sure what you mean by catch all statement/excuse but it's true. Riot is still a business. I agree that happy customers will make you prosper, look at a good restaurant for example. \nI dont know the exact number of people who buy skins, but since they made some things free (Level up chests and the honor reward system), skin sales must be lower than previously. Heck I got Pyke from a loot chest I got from the honor system. Legendary Skins like Gentleman Cho, Battlemaster cho, not lying either. 20 dollars were given to me for free cause I got lucky. That's lost profit.\n\nMore happy players equals more money. That depends on if they want what riot offers. Like that Blood Moon Eve had me going \"Pretty!\" But I hardly see Eve players and fewer with that skin. Overall it's a true statement.\nI'll agree wholeheartedly to the Lack of Vision part. Where they are mainly reacting to the latest trends rather than making the game cool to play. Hell itd be cool if they got Clash working properly, I'll shell out money for tourney buy ins cause I LOVE the competition feel I got from the beta but I haven't heard anything about it for months. Itd be cool if there were more special interactions between Champions. See MF flirting with Graves or Zac arguing with Galio over who's tougher or even Sion screaming at Jarvan cause he killed his granddad. There's cool stories in League and I'd love to see em more in gameplay or cool vids.\nThere are so many issues with league. We are {{champion:203}} spirits there. I strongly dislike lethality due to the weird math, its complicated and is very successful. It does feel like the next \"Awesome\" thing thrown in for shits and giggles but it works so why change it right?\n LoL is nearly 10 years old, that's amazing for a Moba. I'd love to see it go on another 10 years if possible, I'll shell out 15 bucks a month for a subscription if I need to in order to have that happen too. However LoL has competition with Dota, Smite, many others. Practically every other video game competes with eachother. They are 'trying' to look cool, some of it is (I think the Akali rework looks cool but I've never played her.), but when we fight back with mouse and keyboard it does hurt them. Players leaving hurts them. Players complaining hurts them. \n\n\"People often ask for a hero when they need a villain\" \n\nLeague doesnt need the Joker to \"put a smile on that face\", it needs our support. It doesnt need Batman to \"Give it permission to die.\" (Bad Bane reference sorry), it needs the help from We The People!","replies":[]},{"poster":"mightysmity","date":"2018-07-24T14:50:21.616+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"You just said 'lack of endgame vision'.

For most of the time I've spent playing and following League, it felt like there was a clear direction the developers were following. They certainly stumbled a fair bit along the way, but the playerbase was hopeful, because we knew that the developers had the best intentions in mind, and communicated with us to push the game towards the right place. Riot had made significant efforts to give us a shared vocabulary, and to let us in on their design pillars and philosophy, all of which we have still held onto to this day. It felt like Riot was truly growing, and that we players had agency over this growth as equal participants in League.\n\nFast-forward to now, and the near-totality of this has been lost. Where League once went in a specific direction, it's now all over the place, with entire tonal shifts happening from patch to patch. Entire portions of the game get reworked, rebalanced, and re-reworked, all without producing any satisfying results, because the underlying work process feels disorganized and lacking in well-defined goals. Communications have also broken down in the extreme, with players and developers voicing open disdain for each other. The shared vocabulary we once had no longer seems to be in use, and it doesn't seem like Riot follows their old design pillars either. The developer posts we've gotten have largely devolved into self-congratulatory puff pieces, with no real insights given on the development principles or methodology Riot uses, and despite the addition of the Dev Corner, its contents mostly boil down to an announcement of the next patch cycle's changes, with the developers there being notorious for very obviously avoiding addressing more pertinent questions and concerns. This isn't a healthy atmosphere, which is also why I think we as a playerbase are much less of forgiving of Riot when they mess up (which happens often). At this point, I'm also not sure if League can ever go back to previous levels of success, but if the devs at least tried to reconnect with their players, that'd be a start.","replies":[{"poster":"Yung Daemon Sand","date":"2018-07-24T00:06:23.000+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":3,"body":"you could've just upvoted his comment ya know","replies":[{"poster":"Teridax68","date":"2018-07-24T00:09:36.989+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"I did!

Most of them in my opinion revolve around the sheer amount of damage champions put out now.\n\nSnowballing- They said they want to stop snowballing but keep increasing the benefit of items.  Snowballing is caused from an increase in gold leading to a huge surge of power. So increasing AD/AP ratios and buffing items is only furthering the problem. Raise base damage and lower ratios to lower the gap that gold provides. \n\nCounterplay Brawlers- Counter play is more and more rapidly disappearing from the game. Just about every brawler/bruiser has a dash and/or immense amount of healing combo'd with some sort of CC.  Most also output a consistent amount of damage. They are pretty much fulfilling the role of ADC and better. With the current output of damage in the game and actual ADC has little to no hope of out playing a brawler alone and against some brawlers even with help.\n\nCounterplay Assassins- This is were the damage really shows.  Previously in League assassins needed to wait for the right opportunity to jump in.  Mainly because their combo would do 60-80% of their targets health.  Now days an assassin needs sometimes as little as 1 item and ignite to 100-0 their target.  In some cases such as Talon and Rengar, the entire combo can go off in a fraction of a second leaving virtually no counter play to anybody short of a tank.\n\nVision- Vision has always been one of the biggest parts of this game yet the grasp on allotted vision seems to be growing smaller and smaller with every patch. Pink Ward's usefulness has dulled down to a stationary sweeper that doesn't expire.  Don't get me wrong, it's usefulness is there especially for junglers, but without the ability to detect \"invisible\" champions this yet again plays into the problem of hindering counter play. It is one of the primary reasons Shako and Talon can run wild right now I think. Lets not even think of the potential problem the new Akali might be with this. The cost of a pink was lowered because of this change but that far from fixes the problem.\n\nYou can take all of this as a personal opinion if you want but think about these things perhaps as you play your games. I want to mention however before I leave that I am a jungle main.  This isn't the ranting of an ADC.  I play many of these problem champions since the jungle has a wide range of playable champions currently. Nocturne, Wukong, and Warwick are some of my main picks. I fall into both the brawler and assassin nonsense. Well for now I will continue to play and hope this game will improve. See you guys on the Rift.","replies":[{"poster":"Sydronaar","date":"2018-07-24T14:25:15.454+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a long time World of Warcraft player as well I would like to say perhaps we really need to keep Ghostcrawler off balance teams.
