EVER.\n\nAnything else you say can and will be used against you by an inhuman, uncaring bot, and you need to accept that.  It's not your fault.  It's the fault of the heartless employees who developed this system and thought they were doing something good.  They don't care about casualties and victims falling through, yet they claim they do.\n\nYour best bet is to file a support ticket and ask politely for them to reverse the ban.  Most likely they won't.\n\nIt always tears my heart up to hear stories like this, but this is the current state of the game.  It's dying.  It's losing players fast, only driven by the esports marketing machine and profits, and all the money from tencent games.\n\nI suggest you just find a different game to play, a game run and managed by HUMAN beings that understand context and compassion.  League is just for streamers now, washed out pros, and angry, depressed mentally ill kids and young adults. (Why do you think saying \"Kys\" is an instant 14 day ban? because Riot KNOWS most gamers are depressed and unable to cope with real life problems so they bring it into League).\n\nFeel free to add me on Discord or Steam.  Post your discord here in a reply (or your steam) and I'll add you.  There are some nice games coming out.
