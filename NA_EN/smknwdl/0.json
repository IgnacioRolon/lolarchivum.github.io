Either they're really toxic, they come to your lane and flame you or yell that you don't get a gank and you suck and flame you, or they're super nice. The super nice junglers either get really fed or feed your lane really hard. There's pretty much no in between with junglers. Sometimes you get  jungler that seems like he doesn't fall under one of those categories but just wait until late game when he ults in a WW or Fiddlesticks. Either he'll ult in when nobody else is around and die 1v5 and he'll be a feeder or a flamer, or he'll ult in 1v5 and take out 3 enemies while waiting for his team to get there. Sad truths in life man.","replies":[{"poster":"SmknWdl","date":"2015-04-06T15:33:51.836+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i guess so.... but i mean i feel like the kind of jungler who when i gank i always get a kill or my lane gets a kill, but i just dont gank lanes i know are gonna have bad trade offs so we either would get counterganked, die, or they would deal more damage and escape... i mean i poke my head into lane sometimes and then ill circle around and gank the other side, but i get flamed at mostly because i dont gank ALOT. If every time i gank we get a kill whats the issue? And if they've pushed lane to turret i cant do much now can i unless they want me to DIVE AT LEVEL 4 INTO A FULL HEALTH ENEMY! Jeez people are so stupid sometimes... i just try to be nice and stuff because I've found that I'm winning more games being nice and i get left with an overall more happy feeling if I've been nice the whole game vs angry. Also it feels like everyone wants me to gank every minute. It's crazy.","replies":[{"poster":"Tsunday","date":"2015-04-06T18:49:10.911+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had this pro enemy jungler the other game. I was Lulu top against a Pantheon (I main support) and I was duoing with my BF who went Jungle Noc after my support role got taken and he realized he couldn't lane with me. I pretty much was shielding through the spears and letting Pantheon push while I poked him so Noc came and got a couple kill off of him. I think Pantheon bitched so much to his jungler that even though he was pushed to my tower when Panth all in-d me and I lived with 250 hp J4 decided he'd come top and dive to shut this Panth up. So J4 flags in and they chase me under turret where J4 ults me. The tower is aggroing Pantheon and I hit him with a Glitterlance. I die. J4 then just stands there with his ult up and Pantheon can't leave turret range and dies. I laughed so hard. I mean really he was pushed up to my tower with 7cs about 6 minutes in because he was too busy throwing spears at me to farm. I'm surprised J4 ganked his lane at all.\n\nBut I'm a support main so I know what it's like to be the team's punching bag. The other game I watched my Vayne flash past the enemy Leona to try to get once all my abilities when on CD. She raged at me when she got her 200hp self stunned and died for it. Like what was I going to do when you flash tumble away from me and snuggle up to Leona? You weren't even in range of their ADC until she stunned you and her ADC turned around.\n\nI don't normally say negative things in chat though because I find positive remarks win more games as well :)","replies":[{"poster":"blkh1","date":"2015-04-06T19:04:05.488+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I found some adc's simply will only go after the enemy adc.  Now I understand that they are the primary, but if their support gets in range and are vulnerable.  I stun, prison, stop them to attack, the adc will simply ignore and keep farming, even if the enemy adc is no where around at the moment.  I like to be opportunistic.  If the kill is there, take it.  If the adc goes in without warning and my abilities are on cd, not much I can do, give warning, ping, say something in chat.  ADC's can have an attitude that you should just read their mind.  Some are super cool.","replies":[{"poster":"Tsunday","date":"2015-04-06T19:10:55.333+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well it was like we had finished the engage, we had just disengaged, it was obvious I didn't have anything up.\n\nBut no I don't believe the ADC should be the main focus. It is so much easier/better to focus the enemy support *unless* you're going for an all in and the ADC is open. The idea is the support is the one poking so when the support tries to poke you shred their HP. Either they waste all their mana healing up and are useless in a 2v2, you get the kill, or they have to B. If they recall then your support should be in front of the enemy minion line zoning the enemy ADC off of exp/cs and harassing them. You really aren't in danger of dying because it is 2v1. If your ADC got the kill they also already have the gold advantage. The enemy support is the reason their ADC is alive anyway so it is much easier to slaughter the ADC if the enemy support is there. \n\nBut a lot of my friends are support mains and a lot of my friends that aren't support mains chill botlane with me when we queue together because they know they just have to not feed and know how to farm and I will play whatever support they need to win lane. Whether it's someone defensive that will save their ass or it's someone aggressive that will hand feed them kills. The biggest problem is my non-adc main friends who chill bot with me suck at positioning as an ADC and then come teamfights it doesn't matter that they were 6/0 for the first 20 minutes, they're going to end up 13/10 at the end of the game.","replies":[{"poster":"blkh1","date":"2015-04-06T19:17:36.187+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can be a bit rapid fire on my abilities.  I need to learn restraint.  Just because the champ is open you don't need to ability them, poke them.

You'll see in the LCS you have so much less poke/harass from supports because they know that if they use that ability they will be punished while it is on CD as well as the fear of getting out of position and being engaged on with the amount of hard engage a lot of supports bring.\n\nNow I mean in low elo yu kind of need to be more aggressive or your botlane will get pushed around and bullied and poked out of lane, but like a lot of low elo supports are like \"My tornado is up, better charge it\" or whatever spell they use. In fact I used to think I needed to play smart in the Leona vs Janna botlane match up I even have a rune page that keeps me up to the same CDR as Janna so that I can get my Zenith Blade off of CD before her Howling Gale comes back up, but like then I notice this Janna is against a Leona and is seriously just sitting there charging up her tornado as harass so it's never up and I can just jump on her whenever I want to.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Yash Gautam","date":"2015-04-06T14:08:32.297+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well it looks like I've just had a bad experience in lane then.
