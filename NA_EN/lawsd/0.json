You will not need a mobile device to verify an email. \n\nIf you're still having problems playing league please reach out to player support and submit a ticket. \n\nYou can find out more information about why this change here: \nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-support/aAVJiLXh-mandatory-email-verification","replies":[]}]}
