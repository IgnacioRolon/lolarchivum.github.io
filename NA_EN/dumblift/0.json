Those codes are only valid for a short time after the event ends, at which point they expire.  However, Riot support can assist players in redeeming valid codes if they were unable to do so during the redemption window.\n\nTL;DR: You can't buy any skins outside of the game store.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-03-02T17:25:24.217+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is correct. \n\nThere is currently no way to obtain the PAX Sivir skin.","replies":[{"poster":"FatedTitan","date":"2015-03-02T17:33:09.266+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":3,"body":"See this, along with other PAX skins, kind of frustrates me.

It even effects the majority of the population on the newer servers, like Korea. eSports was big prior those servers but League only became big when it became accessible. If League wasn't huge over there when these skins were given away, Korean players had no real chance of obtaining these limited skins whatsoever.\n\nStating that players should've turned up at a PAX event is unreasonable, especially if they reside in another country that isn't even on the same continent of the events. \n\nI personally believe Riot should either make them legacy skins *or* use a random PAX mystery gift to replace the free mystery skin you receive at the end of year if you've not been banned. Those who originally owned the skin get a banner and summoner icon.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Electro522","date":"2015-03-03T07:40:15.374+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It actually isnt Riot's fault. If I recall, PAX explicitly said that Riot can not, and will not sell the PAX skins for any monetary value, at any time before or after the event, nor can they give away any of the skin codes before or after the event.\n\nThus, don't blame Riot, for I'm sure they would LOVE to make some money off of that AWESOME Pax Sivir skin. PAX Twisted Fate is actually regarded as the rarest skin in all of League of Legends. Do you know how much a code for that skin would go for?\n\nAnd believe me, I know the pain.
