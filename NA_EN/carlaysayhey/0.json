However, it looks like you are referring to a more targeted version where you only appear offline to certain individuals.  Unfortunately, this feature does not exist in the League of Legends Friends List.  The \"appear invisible\" feature is something that has been requested by the community, and it is something that we have taken under consideration.  Although, please keep in mind that I can make no guarantee as to whether it will ever be implemented.\n\nI do sincerely apologize if this causes any inconvenience!","replies":[]}]}
