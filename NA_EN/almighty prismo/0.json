I have a lot of trouble consistently hitting single-target abilities, but I want to broaden my domain a bit. (I&#039;ve been eyeing {{champion:9}} for a long time, but worried by the fact that all 3 of his normal abilities are single-target spells)\r\n\r\nThere are two reasons I have trouble with these. One is that aiming them is a lot more precise than skillshots, since the cursor has to be on the target&#039;s hitbox. Often times I&#039;ll accidentally hit a minion next to a champion, or just end up clicking on empty space next to a champion.\r\n\r\nThe other reason is that, in the chaos of teamfights, I keep losing track of my cursor. This isn&#039;t a problem for skillshots, where the big blue outline is easy to see, but basically renders my single target abilities useless until I find the cursor again.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have any suggestions on how to mitigate these issues? I know smartcast can somewhat help with the first one, but I was wondering if there are any additional gameplay options I&#039;m unaware of, like changing the cursor or something.","replies":[{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2017-01-16T05:39:08.847+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't understand how you can mess up hovering your mouse and pressing a button.  Just use smartcast (quickcast as you young whippersnappers call it these days)  with range indicators on.  If you press the button it just shows you the range, hover your mouse and release.\n\nNever heard of anyone losing the cursor before, pretty sure its on the top layer and its pretty easy follow.  I'd reccomend trying to look at the entire screen at once.  I don't know how to describe this better than, try to keep everything in your vision in peripheries or just stare at the mouse in teamfights.","replies":[]}]}
