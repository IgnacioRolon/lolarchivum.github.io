We both received  the Riot Kayle skin, but no Poro icon. The strange thing is that we didn't get any sort of notifications  when we received the skin, but one of our friends that got both the skin and the icon got some sort of popup.\n\nIn my opinion, they should have just put the Skin and Icon for sale in the shop for 1 IP or something and done something different for the people that already own Riot Kayle. They wouldn't have to worry about people not receiving anything on time and for the (strange) people that don't want Riot Kayle, they can just opt out. \n{{item:3157}}","replies":[]}]}
