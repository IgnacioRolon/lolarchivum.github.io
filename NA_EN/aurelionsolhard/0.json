I have tried trouble shooting the problems, updating all drivers, running scans, etc., however I still have not been able to come up with a solution. My game issues don't stop there though. More recently i have been in a constant state of DC'ing and reconnecting. Usually DC'ing for about 1-2mins then reconnecting for about 5-10 seconds then going immediately back to disconnecting. \nI'm beginning to get very frustrated with this as I have been dealing with this issue for close to a week now. I'm really not sure what else to do besides take my computer to a computer repair shop or something. I just want to know if this is a problem on my side, or Riot's side!
