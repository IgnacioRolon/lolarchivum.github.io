I have every setting on very low, and put the game priority to high, and the best I get is around 30 fps. In teamfights I drop to 5 fps. I run at 5 fps when I spectate as well.\r\n\r\nSpecs:\r\n-8 gigs ram\r\n-intel i5-4200U CPU @ 1.6 GHz 2.2GHz (core? processer? Idk it's under processor but it also says i5 core)\r\n\r\nNow I'm not a tech junkie so i have no idea what half of the things listed in the \"about\" tab are. If there's anything else needed to help troubleshoot my dead framerate please tell me. It's so aggravating that I can't even run the game at a constant 40 fps at all \"very low\" graphics settings while my friend's with only 4 gigs of ram can run everything on medium graphics at 50 fps.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-13T22:05:35.192+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're running Windows 10, this could be caused by the recent anniversary update that enabled the Game DVR feature in the game bar.
