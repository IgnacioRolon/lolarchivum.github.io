You're right! \n\nI can, in fact, see that you've got the Honor 5 ward, which should mean you ended the season at Honor 5, but for some reason, the honor tab isn't showing any history of you being rank 5, and currently showing rank 3. \n\nSorry for that mixup. I'm still talking this over with some people trying to figure out exactly what happened here. I'm going to get you a ticket created with our game people so that we can track this issue and make sure it's fixed properly.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"JK Kotori Minami","date":"2017-11-22T03:51:36.111+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You are not the only one.
