I agree Ashe is one of the easiest ADC's to start playing and learning but that doesn't necessarily mean you've even grasped the concept of playing Ashe. For instance, Ashe is one of those champs who's easy to play but difficult to master. When you master, Ashe has a high skill cap with her global ult.
