I then had that person on my team the next game after that one and i'm assuming they were tilted andd wanted to potentially troll. They locked in xin support with exhaust and ignight, I tried to dodge the game but for some reason quitting at 4 seconds that did not happen so once i relogged it loaded back up. Anyway they just walked around the map after dieing 1 time in bot and spent it just standing around random parts of the map or walking up to the enemy another time and died. The rest of their time was spent afk at our base. from their match history it possibly was a one time thing, but from my understanding this is atleast a punishable offense even though they did not type anything in chat they were practically afk or idlessly walking about, they are also under leveled and made our jhin fight bot 1 v 2 for most of the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Mcmxcix","date":"2019-10-19T16:06:43.566+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"actually i main XIn Zhao as support, with Glacial/Resolve, he's hella fun and no one expect good results, just pray that your adc isn't a coward, at the end if you got a good ADC, you'll win the game thanks to the bot lane.","replies":[{"poster":"Zepic AngelDeath","date":"2019-10-20T03:02:03.389+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea sadly I dont think he was playing that game at all, he just died then aimlesly walked around the map like he was on 5k ping and did nothing.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-10-19T04:48:03.227+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How sad, Xin sup played well could have been hilarious.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tele II","date":"2019-10-19T03:46:34.370+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hope you reported him. That is a 14 day ban minimum. Expect it to take a while until action is taken, since so many people report simple mistakes as trolling and theres probably a bit of a backlog. Hope he gets his 14 day.","replies":[{"poster":"Zepic AngelDeath","date":"2019-10-19T04:18:15.210+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea I did.
