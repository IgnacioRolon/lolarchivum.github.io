No really. If were talking about American law, the First Amendment only applies to the government making laws that prohibit speech and, even then, freedom of speech isnt absolute. For example, you cant incite a riot, plan to kill the president or yell fire in a crowded theater.\n\n>Also, theres nothing in the First Amendment that protects you from the consequences of your speech. People are fired all the time for making derogatory comments about their employer. My workplace, for example, has a social media policy that says that I can be terminated for badmouthing the company. They dont ask for passwords and access as some companies have been known to do, but it wouldnt be all that difficult to find me on the internet, knowing my real name, phone number and address.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightsky Pirate","date":"2019-11-08T04:01:35.230+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":7,"body":"You missed the point of the OP.
