I don't quite remember when I started playing but my earliest icon is from Season 2. However I was looking up S2 and I remember playing before that, even as early as beta. It might have just been a different account but It would be cool to know if this was my account carried from beta for all these years. I submitted a ticket but I was only directed to a....very undewhelming website for general stats and things. However I was able to learn my summoner ID so maybe someone would be willing to check into general timeframe (assuming they are generated in sequence) without me having to do a full written consent for simply the age of my account.\r\n\r\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}\r\nA Very Thankful Player","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-02T15:51:19.928+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately, we're unable to share specific account information like creation date.  There's no way to really tell you either.  This is a piece of information our account team uses in cases of account recovery, so it's important to keep that information safe and secret.  Hope that helps clear things up.","replies":[{"poster":"Hornypotsmoker","date":"2016-11-03T07:39:50.034+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, thank you for your time\n{{sticker:zombie-nunu-tears}}","replies":[]}]}]}
