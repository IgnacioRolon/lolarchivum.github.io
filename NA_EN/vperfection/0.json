I've searched google but the results that I am getting are very old and with the old client. Could someone lend me a hand? Pretty please?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-11T22:31:10.300+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"League doesn't actually use P2P transfer any longer, which is why all the info you were finding on google was so old! It was an archaic system that really just doesn't work up to our standards anymore, and the new client only uses direct connections to the patching servers. \n\nLet's still see if we can smooth out those lag spikes though! Adjusting some of your networks settings might be able to help out, but let's check for any packet loss first. Hit up our [**log reader**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743) and throw your most recent game logs in that gave you problems. Take a screenshot and paste it here using something like Gyazo or Imgur and we can go over it together.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Blondz","date":"2017-06-17T18:11:44.890+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}}","replies":[{"poster":"Backdoor In Ashe","date":"2017-11-05T15:06:13.214+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"But why am i downloading now 3mb/s when iÂ´ve already downloaded 15mb/s last patch? its an p2p download 100%","replies":[]}]}]}
