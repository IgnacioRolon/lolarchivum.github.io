This guy was blaming EVERYONE for his problems except himself. He began the game by LITERALLY running it down bot lvl 1 and says (Shaco supp, thanks) like its my fault, im supposed to grab his keyboard and play for him right? I dont think ANYTHING i said should warrant any type of punishment what so ever, i explained to him that he needs to stop blaming everyone else for what HE is doing - Mind you at lvl 3 he was sitting in base for the REST of the game dancing, after he ran it down bot 3x in a row to make my 2v1 even harder. Why do the people who are getting trolled get punished but the troll doesnt? He didnt actually say anything to flag the automated system, but i assure you the entire team reported him.... but nope, nothing, instead i get muted... lol. Im not here to argue, or going to argue with anyone about if i deserved to be muted. I didnt, there is no debate. What needed to happen was this guy needed at a minimum a 14 day ban. people like this RUIN the game for everyone, even the enemy team, and then hold you hostage till 20 minutes because they refuse a surrender vote to troll you even further. Riot needs to fix this.\n\nEDIT: I didnt even notice those second game chat logs when posting this... someone explain to me what exactly is wrong with that? i remember that game, dude was following me around the jungle stealing my camps and trolling me cause he didnt like how i was playing... WHAT was said there that was so wrong aside from clarifying what i was reporting him for \"Telling me to slit my wrists\" lol.. really riot?
