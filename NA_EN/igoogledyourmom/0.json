I can certainly feel the difference in Ping as I play {{champion:126}} . I've made a post on Reddit asking if anyone in the GA, USA area if they have similar issues &amp; people are experiencing the same problem.\n\nIs there anything on RIOT's end to Fix this?

My average pings usually 60-80, and today like just now, it jumped to 1k.  I don't now what happened, but I've been getting lag everyday.  Is it just because the servers are currently bad? New update? or what. So i totally agree with you about this.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-23T18:29:03.261+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The increase in ping could be due to a few reasons like an issue with your network reaching our servers, but it could certainly be a result of the routing your ISP is taking too.  As a first step, I suggest using our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to strengthen your connection.  This should hopefully fix you up, but let me know if you still have any issues and we can go from there!","replies":[{"poster":"iGoogledYourMOM","date":"2016-08-24T00:28:16.525+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So far...\n\n* I've Turn off my Modem for 5mins & Plug it back In...
