It delayed rotations a little bit but if bot turret falls doesnt it basically end top laning phase and begin this turret snowball of adcs just objective breaking with their gold lead they get from bottom lane.

Im just curious at how prioritized and how much impact first turret has and how often that turret is bot lane. Even if it's not as impactful the perceived power of most gold the easiest way is from bot lane. I think large objectives like heralds and dragons to be looked at as ways for teams to get immediate power instead of almost all trades of turrets vs anything but baron being favorable for the turret. Maybe major objectives should give some gold, maybe things like dragon could give immediate flat stats and not just percents. Maybe some turrets need to be worth more than others idk I just feel the perceived snowball u can get from not winning bot lane is really high.","replies":[]},{"poster":"haaaaaaalp","date":"2018-03-17T17:25:17.011+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Maple Nectar,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=EeKjJENI,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2018-03-17T16:51:39.159+0000)\n>\n> This is super timely.

Great thoughts!\n\nWhatever is done, just don't take this topic's suggestion. The argument it makes is actually opposite the important logic: why should a teammate incur a penalty because I helped him secure a kill? Making solo kills give more gold to the killer than assisted kills presents a really shitty situation for anyone who wants to assist (do I want more gold on this guy or do I want more gold teamwide?). Also, solo kills are REALLY unlikely at higher levels of play, so adjusting solo kill gold isn't likely to fix the problems there.\n\nIf you look at anything in the neighborhood, (and I don't think you should) it should be increasing kill gold and reducing assist gold so that it ends up around the same total on an assisted kill, but a greater proportion goes to the person who gets the kill. This also, unfortunately, means increasing kill gold at baseline, which seems like a pretty sacred-do-not-touch thing. (Affects too much.)\n\nIt'd make more sense, imo, to look to address the issues with support gold and ADC itemization before this was looked into (admittedly, this doesn't touch the jungle, but it's a start, and- it'll also indirectly affect jungle powerlevel). -Especially- after the AP item changes, there's less of a meaningful difference in item spike timings between bot and other lanes, and ever since supports have been \"freed\" from sightstone, they've been \"freed\" to get that much more power in gold put elsewhere. (Maybe the changes to GLP will help with mid spikes, but I'm not holding my breath; tear is prevalent, and very slow to give midlaners power besides the ability to waveclear more before basing.)\n\nAdjusting globally-affected gold income to lower the power of bot/jg is trying to fix an issue with a lever that affects way more than it. It makes sense to nerf gp10 if support has too much gold. It makes sense to maybe play with camp values, respawns, things like that if JG has too much gold. But it doesn't really make sense to play with things like kill gold or tower gold to fix those, since those affect so many things. (The only real exception here might be first tower bonus, since that feels particularly likely to occur around the ADC/support. I suppose outer turret local gold is also likely to get obtained -first- by the ADC, too, so shifting some or all of that local gold back into global gold might help, too. That's assuming it really is disproportionately likely that ADC/support get local tower gold before anyone else, though. I'd guess it is, but I don't know for certain.)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Huang Shaotian","date":"2018-03-18T22:26:05.920+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey maple nectar.

They get gold because i got kills and then died. If i didn't get a couple of solo kills, they would not profit from me dieing top.

Just imagine the rage of all the ego players. There are enough adc's and stuff that throw games/afk if you take 1 wave of minions. now if you throw in a shield or a stun they will freak out about taking away their gold. no matter if they actually needed the help or not.\n\nAnd last but not least, what if this actually starts a meta of supports being forced to do their job less (help their carries) because they get more fed if they do it alone? this system basicly means the adc can earn more money if you stay away. Sure one could say it adds a layer of decision making.  \nCan he do it alone and get more money? or is it safer to help but earn him less gold? once your adc snowballs the smarter choice seems to be dont help. Which means the game gives you benefit for not doing anything.
