Earlier this year, our team performed the EUW migration to the Amsterdam datacenter, and now we’re ready to tackle NA. While this is a slightly different type of migration, we’re taking learnings from Amsterdam to deliver on the core advantages of the EUW migration: more stable connectivity, minimized downtimes, and improved service.\r\n\r\nSo, why are we doing this? Over the evolution of League’s growth, we’ve renovated the existing environment quite a bit. To accommodate this expansion, improve security, and upgrade our hardware and software, we’re starting from a blank slate and building everything from the ground up. This means an all-new, state of the art network and server infrastructure for NA! \r\n\r\nOur number one goal with this migration is increasing server stability: allowing you to play the game whenever you want and with minimal service interruption. This new environment will also give us more tools to prevent malicious attacks, which means even more stability. \r\n\r\nThis migration is just one part of our commitment to get you the service you deserve, starting with increased stability. Latency is definitely on our radar, though ping isn’t what we should address right now. Instead, we’re tackling stability first because ping is sort of a moot point without a stable game foundation—low ping doesn’t really help if you’re experiencing disconnects or can’t even log in. \r\n\r\nWe’re in the last phases of our build out and migration testing period, so we’re **tentatively scheduling the migration for early November**. We’ll post another announcement on Boards about two weeks before migration day, and we’ll make a final announcement the day before migration.  \r\n\r\nAs a heads up, during the migration, you won’t be able to log into the client or play League for about 12 hours. Don’t worry—we’re planning maintenance for the middle of the night, like we do for patch releases, so we’ll minimize the impact of our downtime. For NA, game time is typically at its lowest between 2:00-3:00am PST, which means we’d start migrating around 12:01am PST. We’ll give you a more specific date and time in our final announcement.\r\n\r\nI’m sure you guys have a ton of questions. Fire away and I’ll do my best. I can answer most stuff, though I can’t divulge certain tech details and specs because that could jeopardize the stability we’re aiming for with this new environment.\r\n\r\n\r\n—Riot Natural20","replies":[{"poster":"Adrith","date":"2014-10-06T21:56:29.391+0000","up_votes":235,"down_votes":11,"body":"Wow the title was a massive bait for east coasters. \"Server migration\" oh we actually just mean we're moving them a few miles down the street to a newer better data center while we fail to address the ping discrepancy that east coasters have been complaining about for literally years. How can a game of League's size and influence not have a fair and functioning server infrastructure for North America? Frankly, I think Riot should be embarrassed at this point. I understand that when League was a fledgling game with a start up company behind the reigns, keeping the servers local was the best solution. \n\nHowever, League has been huge for several years at this point, and I firmly believe ping should be a top priority for such a heavily competitive and reactionary oriented game. The fact that this Riot employee seems to be oblivious to the progress of any real server migration illustrates how Riot values this issue. You'd be hard pressed to find a MOBA or even MMO for that matter that doesn't have an east coast server farm. If fracturing the player base is a concern then move the servers to a central location, or find another solution. Riot has addressed server issues abroad and expanded the game to new regions of the world all while ignoring the glaring issue in their native land. \n\nFor those of you who don't believe that 100 v. 30 ping makes any difference I encourage you to log into a different region and give it a try. Those of us on the east coast already know that Latin America North provides a vastly superior experience than NA at this point. It boggles my mind that this issue has gone unresolved and even unaddressed for so long. The last update we had was well over half a year ago, and I think many of us held out hope that the end of S4 would bring a resolution. While that's still a possibility, this post just seems to underline Riot's ignorance or unwillingness to fix this issue.","replies":[]},{"poster":"jfox","date":"2014-10-06T19:56:59.858+0000","up_votes":155,"down_votes":19,"body":"tl:dr - servers staying on west coast. nothing fixed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Amui","date":"2014-10-06T19:23:42.779+0000","up_votes":86,"down_votes":6,"body":"How will this impact east coast players? improved ping?","replies":[{"poster":"Natural2020","date":"2014-10-06T19:27:46.691+0000","up_votes":142,"down_votes":544,"body":"> How will this impact east coast players? improved ping?\n\nNo, there are no changes to ping in this update, as the game servers will still be on the West Coast.

It might be the correct one, but I'm willing to wait and see the response.\n\n\nThe servers have never moved right? For a long time, when I began playing, my ping was a very manageable 81. I'm hoping, truly hoping that Riot can somehow miraculously get it back to those levels.\n\nI'd still prefer lower pings than that, and we'll complain for lower pings again, but I'm willing to get back the ping I originally had, at 81.\n\n\nTry your best please Riot, this is THE issue preventing me from playing your game and giving you money.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Aaron Rodgers","date":"2014-10-06T20:36:33.078+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":4,"body":"|~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~|\n|~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~|\n| W~~~~~ X ~~~~~~~~~~~~ Y ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Z ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~|\n|~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~|\n|~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~|\n\nLet me put this in a picture for you since it seems hard for an entire company to understand.  \n\nThe box is representing the NA server.  \n\nW is where the servers are.
