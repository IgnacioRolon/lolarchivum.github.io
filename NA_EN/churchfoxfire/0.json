I have been some issues where in game I get attempting to reconnect every 3 minutes or so. I have tried numerous \"fixes\" but none seem to work and have done all the steps in the connection issues guide. Some temporarily fix it so the time between connection increases, now up to 5 minutes, but it lasts longer as well. I have even called to my ISP but they say nothing is causing problems. And only League is having this connection issue. While reviewing other \"Fixes\" I came across one that used a VPN. Figured could test that out. And sure enough that worked. No disconnects but instead had major latency spikes then. Would love a fix to this so I can get back to play with friends and climbing the rank ladder. To scare to play anything that isn't custom out of fear of being reported for afking.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-27T18:06:04.941+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm glad you were able to find a workaround despite the connection guide not solving your specific issue.

Though last time it said no issues. Maybe it will make more sense for your tech support to review.","replies":[{"poster":"Lisa Wilbourn","date":"2017-04-04T22:19:49.945+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did you ever get this fixed? This looks exactly like my issue but both Riot support and my ISP's customer support agents haven't seemed to find a fix beyond using a VPN. An agent from my ISP suggested changing my router and upgrading my internet plan but that isn't really an option for me. \n\nLeague seems to work fine with CyberGhost, but outside of that I've not found another VPN that works for me.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
