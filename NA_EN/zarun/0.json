I cannot believe how soft people are that play this game now.  In the real world, people get angry and say mean things.  Then they calm down and move on with their lives.  Sometimes you might even be in the same area where bad words are said.  Are all of you going to completely shut down and need to go to a safe space?  Grow the fu%k up.  THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS CYBER BULLYING.  Stop being a victim.  Real bullying occurs when someone has to go to a particular place and they cannot get away from their attacker.  In a video game, you simply hit mute and the problem goes away.  NOONE makes you sit there and read what other people are typing.  You are being a sheeple.  The ONLY reason to report someone in this game is if they are intentionally feeding or straight up afk farming and not helping the team at all.  IF SOMEONE SAYS MEAN WORDS YOU JUST MUTE THEM AND MOVE ON WITH YOUR LIFE.

A kid being beaten 24/7 may grow up being violent, but they can also be very empathising as a result, but if a person is told that they're trash and should go die 24/7, they will only grow up being completely fked in the head. One can not underestimate the power of words.\n\nWords are also very context sensitive, and different people may not see the same context within the same words. That's why you while no need to censor yourself, but you have to pay some mind on what others may be offended by and not iron-fist it in when they are.
