Please make sure your video card is using the latest video drivers from the manufacturer.&quot;\r\nI have updated everything its asking for yet it still tends to show up. \r\nThe only thing is due to my laptop breaking down im using a kinda run down pc which had 2 Gb ram and windows xp and it worked smoothly. I then gave it to a shop to get windows 7 and since then its not working and giving me that error despite of me having all the drivers needed. would really love some solutions \r\nty","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-17T21:19:17.523+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like the game is failing to render and resulting in a crash, so performing updates is definitely a solid step.
