Please remove those as well. \r\n\r\nIt&#039;s not a big deal because this is League of Legends GD, and the people here really shouldn&#039;t discuss politics anyway.... BUT, if there is a politics discussion, you can&#039;t cherry pick certain posts on political issues and remove them because someone finds them offensive. IT&#039;S POLITICS, PEOPLE DO NOT AGREE WITH EACH OTHER.\r\n\r\nThe only thing insulting about the post I made was the fact that I support Trump&#039;s idea about a wall on our Mexican border. I don&#039;t support Trump, but I do support this idea. The only people that find this offensive probably aren&#039;t American citizens or they support illegal immigration, and in those two cases, their opinion is moot anyway.\r\n\r\nSo like I said, I was insulted and offended by everything else in that thread, please do something about it.","replies":[]}
