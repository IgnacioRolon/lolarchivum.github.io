Now this makes no sense at all but it seems like the fan controller I installed will sometimes disable my fans when I switch back to OSX from W7 when I have that particular program closed before restarting in OSX. When I restart with the Mac's Fan Control Running, my fans function normally when returning to OSX and I can play LoL with no FPS issues.\n\nLike I said, it makes no sense whatsoever given that they are separate partitions entirely and one does not run while the other is running, but I've tested this and I'm 100% sure that this is my issue. Strange, but it is what it is I suppose, despite defying logic lol.","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-06-07T22:47:19.659+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow.\n\nDamn, that is pretty weird actually.  I'm not even entirely sure I would ever think of something along those lines, but I'm very happy to hear you believe you found the root cause!

Noting that I actually couldn't hear them, when normally with this version of MBP that's all you hear, I immediately thought to test and see if they were broken by switching to my bootcamp partition because Windows doesn't do a good job of managing the Mac fans when you play some graphic intensive games like SWTOR or Fallout: NV with heaps of texture mods, which is what got me to manually control them on the Windows side anyway.\n\nI am absolutely puzzled as to why this would carry over to OSX partition either way. Is there some sort of BIOS equivalent on the Mac hardware that could be affected by manually controlling the fans through third party software in windows?\n\nNot that I'm not happy I can play normally again, or that it takes no longer than 10 seconds to reboot on either OS with this machine, I just really thought that changes made in a separate partition shouldn't carry over no matter what.\n\nIt's just puzzling, despite knowing that this seems to be how my laptop works now.","replies":[]}]}
