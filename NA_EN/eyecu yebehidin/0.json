Well, more accurately, it's not something the amount of money Riot has can fix.  How much do you think Netflix is paying Comcast to prioritize their video traffic?  NetFlix is a $20B company.  Comcast is a $140B company.  Riot is a tiny fish in the internet game.\n\nWhat Riot needs, and I know this is going to be super frustrating, is time.  While they can't buy paid prioritization from all the major ISPs, they can buy a new facility to put servers in and lay big fat fiber lines to those ISPs with.  The problem is that you have 3 different levels of government that all need to approve your new server farm, then you have to negotiate with half a dozen other companies...it's not a quick process.","replies":[{"poster":"Penguin Eclipse","date":"2014-11-21T23:39:13.441+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> > Even if that's the case tell these %%%^& at riot to pay up.

Because it is an interconnect agreement. There is no prioritizing.\n\nAlthough the deal doesn't technically violate net neutrality, because it concerns peering with other networks, Comcast is absolutely prioritizing Netflix traffic through their policy of paid direct interconnection with Netflix.  Packets delivered by non-paying entities like Cogent are being throttled by Comcast refusing to upgrade their peering ports.\n\nIn effect, there are already fast and slow lanes on the internet.\n\n> What Riot needs is to put servers somewhere other than Portland, one of the stupidest places they could possibly put servers.\n\nPortland is quite an excellent place to put servers.  Cheap green power, plentiful IT talent, and direct fiber access to almost every tier 1 ISP.  Many companies have servers in or near Portland, including Google, Facebook, Apple, Intel, Amazon ...\n\nThe thing is, when Riot decided to pick Portland, they didn't know that Comcast and Verizon would try to kill settlement-free peering with said tier 1 ISPs.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Penguin Eclipse","date":"2014-11-21T23:33:20.885+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> > So the first time you guys moved your servers, I went from 72 ping to 92.
