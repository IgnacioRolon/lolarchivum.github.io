From what I&#039;ve seen, almost every class has one or more of these types of champions. For assassins there are Ekko, Zed, and perhaps Katarina. For fighters we have things like Gangplank, Fiora, Camille, Yasuo and Riven. Mages have Ryze, Azir, Zoe, and perhaps Taliyah. Draven, Vayne, and Kalista all have high skill caps and are of the marksman class. Even supports, who some view solely as shield bots, contains champions like Thresh, Bard, Ivern, and maybe even Rakan. This leaves us with tanks. The most difficult tank/ highest skill cap one is Singed due to his very unique playstyle.   The next most difficult tanks it seems would be Galio, Shen, Poppy, and Ornn. But when thinking of these, none of them bring to mind something like Yasuo does for fighters, or Zed does for assassins. They just don&#039;t seem to have the outplay potential, difficulty, or mastery that certain iconic champions from other classes do. One big thing the four tanks have in common is their high impact ults which seems to be the only thing making them more difficult than any other tank. To end this, I know some of this is simply opinion and not actually factual but feel free to disagree and say why in the comments.","replies":[{"poster":"Bazerka","date":"2018-06-11T06:05:48.690+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're not wrong, interesting challenge for you: Why not prototype a tank you'd think would do well as \"the next tank\".

Here it is:\n\n-      For his main source of CC he can have a zone in front of him that roots enemies for a second, I don't think this should be too long or a powerful cc like a knockup or a stun since that makes it too difficult to play against and considering his ult (paragraph 4) it'd be way too strong. \n - This gives him the desired cc in a tank.

In my eyes, a mobile tank can jump into the enemy team to disrupt them, forcing them to use their abilities on him or risk being constantly cc'ed or being caught out somehow. Afterall, that's what tanks already do, the champion wouldn't be using the mobility to escape, but rather to initiate and threaten the enemy team with CC instead of damage.

Certainly got me curious.\n\nWow, I'll admit, I wasn't exactly expecting a reply from a red but thank for it none the less. To me, it seems like the way to make a tank into a high skill cap champion would be to make what tanks do best, ta(n)king damage, different somehow. Right now they can't force someone to click on them or aim spells at them. The threat of either their damage or cc is the only thing making them the focus if other more high priority targets are in range like the ADC or Mid Laner. Also, I think I'll give your challenge a shot although I've never actually created a champion before.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Onotori","date":"2018-06-11T11:17:58.936+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I always thought a reactive tank would be cool, and we don't really have a champ that interacts with other champs' abilities, so what about an anti-projectile tank?

The abilities are also really interesting seeing as they interact with spells. I like that there is interaction but I was thinking of counter play, such as if you throw a skill shot out to kill someone, and the tank is standing close to them and takes the spell, does it feel cheap or is it something more like an outplay?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Daedeye","date":"2018-07-04T21:21:15.607+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know, I was not challenged, still I'd like to try...\n\nSpectre - The Ghostly Shield\n\nPassive: Spectral Energy\nWhen Spectre is taking damage, she gains 10 energy stacks for every 1% health, she lost, for 5 seconds.
