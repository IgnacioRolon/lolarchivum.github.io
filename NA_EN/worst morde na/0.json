I posted the chat log here, even tho it won't show what my allies had typed.\r\n\r\nI'm pretty sure my ban won't be lifted, even tho I was the one being flamed here, yet, when I have an ally tell me to go hang myself, and go away from the servers forever, they get off scott free with a wrist slap. It's sad really. Notice I never called anyone a bad name, or talked bad towards anyone at all. Rather, I was being called a troll because I had a bad game ( look at my match history and you should see an 7 game win streak, looks as if one bad game gets you reported)\r\n\r\nWhy is this a thing? I died super early and was 2 levels behind. Than when I went under tower, I'd be out csed and cc'ed and killed in a few hits. I tried to tell my team, but I got flamed for \"trolling.\" You can look at my match history and see very well that I am not trolling. Yet people tell me awful things and get away with it, but I get this chat ban. How crazy.\r\n\r\n\r\nGame 1\r\nIn-Game\r\nWorst Morde NA: gg\r\nWorst Morde NA: i lost\r\nWorst Morde NA: i died once\r\nWorst Morde NA: thats how this meta is\r\nWorst Morde NA: if you die

you just spent the entirety of the game arguing in chat which distracts both you and your teammates. You should really just mute the flamers instead of engaging in an argument with them. \n\nYou could try to reach out to Riot with a support ticket and try to appeal this, although I would try to use the live chat if possible as most of the time you only get the Blitzcrank bot reading you your rights when you send a ticket.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-03-04T10:19:14.839+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oddly, I don't see anything specifically negative in this (usually, threads with this sort of title have a chatlog full of the OP flaming back). I suppose you might've gotten dinged for spending the entire match arguing nonstop, which distracts your teammates and otherwise accomplishes nothing. Other than that, this log honestly seems pretty harmless to me.\n\nNext time you encounter players like this, use the mute function, and use it early.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tele II","date":"2019-03-05T03:00:46.193+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi, Anivia main here, glad to see her doing mean things to you. Not personal,  I just love anivia lol. Anyways, damn, you didnt even retaliate with toxicity. I guess it was just cuz of the excessive chat use. You did a whole lot of explaining what happened in the past, a whole lot of explaining why you cant win, just nothing that would help you win the game in the slightest. I dont support the chat restrict decision, but I can understand why it was made. Chat is supposed to be for communicating with teammates about strategy. Sure, it doesnt always have to be about strategy, you can say some random things no problem. But to this extent, its a bit much. Thats the only reason i could think of why they would CR you. Just way too much complaining and arguing. I know its obvious, not trying to condescend to you,but really just mute next time. They arent owed any explanation.","replies":[{"poster":"Worst Morde NA","date":"2019-03-05T05:42:45.679+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're right, I should have muted them.
