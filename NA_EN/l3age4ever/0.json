I have mastery 7 on this champion from when he was actually hard, and then you buffed him two patches in a row when he didn&#039;t need either of them. All you people care about is the LCS and making money. If we could just go back to the end of season six when this game was actually fun to play and was semi-balanced. Assassins actually used to be hard, and then preseason 7 came around and you guys just messed it all up. you made assassins guaranteed one shots even if they were behind which renders champions like{{champion:202}} {{champion:51}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:42}} {{champion:41}} {{champion:222}} {{champion:15}} {{champion:29}} all the most usless unplayable champions ever, they just got instantly one shot by champions like{{champion:103}} {{champion:84}} {{champion:74}} {{champion:31}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:238}} {{champion:134}} {{champion:121}} {{champion:59}} and every single other assassin that exists. This game went from really fun to just really annoying and rage educing. So for this I quit until this game becomes playable again for every lane. P.S. make lane phase exist for more than 5 minutes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI quit this game until it becomes balanced and actually fun.","replies":[]}
