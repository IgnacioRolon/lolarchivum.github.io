ROBOT or start with this show. I&#039;ve been hearing mixed reviews about this show with people saying it&#039;s good and terrible, I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll have high expectations anyways I mean is a Netflix exclusive right? Not that I expect it to be bad either. A Youtuber I follow frequently made sort of made a review on the show, he said the show could be interpreted in 2 ways one of which Hannah is faulting everyone else for hear suicide and it&#039;s their fault because they _could_  have done something about it. In this instance he described her as very passive and just waits for shit to happen instead of taking control of life, trying to get help for herself, and telling someone about what happened to her when she had the chance; Clay loved this girl but she was blind to it at one point in the show he said she told him to leave when I guess he was trying to help? It was too late though and now he&#039;s grieving thinking he&#039;s at fault for Hannah&#039;s suicide.\r\n\r\nEhhh, this just doesn&#039;t sit well with me I don&#039;t like the thought of an emotionally unstable person that blames people for their suicide and took no action to try to help themselves, leaving this kind of guilt on people is selfish imo but hey I&#039;ve never watched it I only know the premise so I could interpret it a different way right?","replies":[]}
