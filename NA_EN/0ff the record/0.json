It is really hard to land a telegraphed skillshot that takes over a second to travel to its destination that can also be interrupted mid flight.  The Q change and ultimate change added some interesting utility at the cost of consistency and a MASSIVE loss of damage in his ultimate.  Zac lost 60%+ of his potential damage on his ultimate for an ability that seems to act more like a Blitzcrank hook then a reverse Ryze ultimate.  Oh, and when Ryze was given this ultimate, his other abilities got more damage, not less.  Zac lost damage in his Q (higher cooldown) and his E.  Zac got completely gutted in this rework and Riot should be in emergency mode fixing this.","replies":[{"poster":"FloofySheep","date":"2017-05-05T22:06:26.219+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even in old Zac,being an experienced Zac player meant you could predict people through Fog of war and kill. Now, with his changes he's way worse for this.

You can't do anything; inane impractical Q and R, rest of his kit is dragged down into obsolescence. Did they even test out this travesty in applied gameplay or just fold their arms and say AAAYYYYYYYYYYYY wacky Zac thematic clarity!!!\n\nWorst champ in the game now.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Grenn Atme","date":"2017-05-04T18:46:13.436+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I fully agree, with the current Zac his abilities just fee so..... lack luster. I mena, the ideas are kinda cool, but the implementation and how they correlate with the champ just flat out suck. His new q has no more AoE(making crowd control harder) less damage, barely any slow, and a effect that basically has you stop everything you're doing to try and land it(that is assuming you're in a possition where you can land it). \nHis E was fine as it was, no reason to nerf it for slightly less charge time, as when you're a Zac player you typically charge it from advantageous areas anyways, as to not get caught out by CC. \nHis new R, oh god, this is the worst part, hard to land, impracticle for acuracy in a team fight, and when compared to the old R, instead of dirupting and throwing about 3-5 champs consistanelty, you'll be lucky to grab their tank and swoop them away. Plus it gives you far less bloblets consistanetly, can't be used to escape effectively from tight situations anymore, and deals far less damage(did I mention the charge time that it has now?).\nHonestly, this \"rework\" really bums me out, Zac was really fun because you could make split second decisions with him, heal well enough to actually tank, and fly across the map into the middle of 5 enemy champs and not worry because your ult was up, sso you could just bounce on out. I don't want these new abilities to be \"touch-up\"(well, maybe something to where the q is about the same as the old one, but a little different effect) all I really want is the old, and super fun, Zac back, he was in such a good spot after being such a bad pick for so long, please riot, I don't want to have to beg, but I am, don't make Zac players go through him being hard nerfed into the ground again.","replies":[{"poster":"FloofySheep","date":"2017-05-05T22:08:00.930+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I played a couple of games with him, and it's the first time in years that I've had to recall from jungle without being in a gank.
