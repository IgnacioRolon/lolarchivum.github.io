This was my chance to buy an SSD, yay. Since the installation of my ssd I had to back up my files which I had not done since last summer. So i restored a bunch old stuff. So now when I play LoL I begin to have FPS issues. it goes from 72 down 13 or even lower at times. I tried just about everything on the support section for FPS issues. I can run the game on very low graphics but even the fps kinda jumps around, but it isn’t that bad. I just don’t understand why I can no longer play on my old settings, medium graphics, without having fps issues. any tips will help. I also tried cutting out the sound for the game still FPS problems. I did SMC reset, PRAM rest etc.. I also tried repairing the client, I tired uninstalling  the client and downloading it again. I will post my specs down low. Any help would be awesome. I really love playing this game and I would hate to stop playing it because of some fps issue.\n\nMacBook Pro (13-inch, Early 2011)\nProcessor 2.3 GHz Intel Core i5\nMemory 8GB 1333 MHz DDR3\nGraphics Intel HD Graphics 3000 512 MB\nOSX El Capitan Version 10.11.5\n Samsung V-NAND SSD 850 EVO 500GB\n\nThank you for your time!","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-07-11T18:35:09.609+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since you've already taken a lot of great first steps to get this resolved, I recommend reaching out to our tech specialists [in a ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).
