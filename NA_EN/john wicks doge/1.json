The issue was that I would get fps issues whenever anything appeared on the screen. For example first blood, dragon being taken, team fights, pings. The game seems like it has to warm up a game or two before it can somewhat handle not having fps issues. So I took it into apple and they mentioned maybe my TRIM was not on and it wasn’t. Went onto terminal and inputted the command code to activate it and my ssd runs a lot better and fps improved a little but still not completely playable because I still get the same fps issues i mentioned before. I have tried lowering my graphics to the lowest settings, no luck. I have turned off the sound and no luck. I have basically done everything the fps trouble shooting forum has mentioned. Have any of you Mac brothers experienced the same thing and have a solution? or anyone have any tips? Plz help. This was basically the only game my mac could run because... it being a mac and all and I really do enjoy this game. I have invested time and money into it and sucks not being able to play it smoothly.

This would make a lot of sense, due to your FPS improving after a few games when the client has been able to download missing assets when requested in a match. I definitely recommend working through the Mac section of the guide that *Rineyy* linked, as it's a great starting point in solving this. \n\nLet me know if you notice any changes after working through that guide.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kürama","date":"2016-07-28T08:19:58.295+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Boost your FPS by utilising the **[Frames for days booster.](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting)** This booster is legal and is approved by Riot.
