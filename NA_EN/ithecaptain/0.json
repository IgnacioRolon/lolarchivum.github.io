There is no game where everybody goes positive. Being upset because someone on your team is worse than someone on the other team is no reason to flame them. You can be upset all you want, but flaming the person that is losing is only going to make them lose worse. If they are doing it on purpose they will probably enjoy the fact that you are mad and it will just put the rest of your team on tilt.
