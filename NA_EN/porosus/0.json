I put in my username and password, it authorizes it, and then says \"logging in\" for about 1 minute and then says \"Unable to Connect to pvp.net servers.\" Whenever it decides to actually let me in, I get the \"Unable to Connect to Chat\" message at the bottom. After many times of clicking the reconnect button, it sometimes allows me to connect to chat. I sometimes only connect for a few seconds, but sometimes I stay connected completely. The problems don't stop there, however. Whenever I try to start a game, I get through champ select and then when I am supposed to start loading the game, I get a black screen and lose connection to pvp.net. I then have to log back in because it refuses to connect and then go through that whole process of not being able to connect at the login screen once again. This problem prohibits me from having fun on League since I cannot even play a full game and finally load in half way through and cost the team the game. After the game is over I instantly get disconnected from chat again. I have never had this problem in the past and I have tried every way of fixing it. I play any other online game perfectly fine. I would really enjoy being able to play League again with my friends, please help.","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-06-14T01:20:39.035+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It honestly seems like there is some sort of connection issue that is preventing you from not only reaching our Login Servers, our Chat Servers, but also our PvP.net Servers.

I have never had this problem before. Apparently neither has anyone else. I've looked through so many forums and posts and people have just had the login problem.
