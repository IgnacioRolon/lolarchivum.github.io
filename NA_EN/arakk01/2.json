So far, Riot Econetics has responded to every player behavior ticket I&#039;ve put in and showed an -utterly- apathetic stance toward his job. In review: \n\nHe has stated that the Player Behavior team isn&#039;t interested in punishing players not flagged by the automated system, even if they&#039;ve admitted to intentionally ruining other players&#039; experience in chat.\n\nHe has stated that banning the content being tested on the PBE is totally OK, even when Blind pick is disabled, even with players stating they&#039;re doing it to make sure &#039;nobody else gets a head start on him&#039;- essentially biasing the testing data for selfish reasons. During this ticket, I first got a canned response about &#039;playing off meta champions isn&#039;t against the rules but you have to communicate with your teammates&#039;. Then, Econetics decided to reply in person when I corrected him- and I quote, &quot;If you don&#039;t want to have your pick banned, you should play blind picks.&quot; At this point in time, Blind Pick was disabled, with only ranked Draft available. When I pointed this out to him, he responded with the generic, &quot;If you have no more questions, this ticket will be closed,&quot; and closed the ticket.\n\nAnd upon filing a recent ticket to ask for clarification on why I can be chat restricted for having a harsh general diction (not flaming, I simply grew up around two colorfully verbose parents and tend to use the &#039;s-word&#039; to refer to anyone acting like a toddler) when of the people reporting me, one went 0/8 and asked why I threw a lantern that got him killed (e.g. &quot;I&#039;m not the dumbass that clicked it&quot;), one admitted to only enjoying ranked &#039;because people tilt harder when I make them lose&#039; (Quit being a shit), and one actively told me (repeatedly!) to kill myself/suck a dick/get fucked %%%got while I tried to explain how to play his champ in a given matchup (&quot;[all]:This Twitch is being a toxic shitfuck&quot;). That is to say, with profanity not being prohibited, why the words &#039;shit&#039; and &#039;dumbass&#039; flagged me for discipline. His response? Almost VERBATIM, one of the FAQ answers about the new chat restriction system. \n\n@RiotLyte, @Riot in general, why is it that you have a PLAYER BEHAVIOR employee more toxic than half the players you&#039;ve ever banned, much less chat restricted? This guy is LITERALLY so apathetic about his job that he&#039;s not willing to even consider any cases that aren&#039;t taken care of for him by the robot. This is why your system is commonly seen as garbage- in cases that do require human intervention to clarify disciplinary actions, the guy who should be doing it gets paid to copy/paste from the player discipline FAQ and doesn&#039;t give half a shit about the playerbase.\n\nEdit: Requested sauce of the latest incident: https://snag.gy/Df4dxN.jpg\n\nEdit 2: And according to Riot Econetics: \"..taking an overly sarcastic demeaning tone is also considered offensive and will not be tolerated.\" In other words, because I use a more complete diction and lay out the correct options for my team in an 'aloof' manner, that counts too. In short, anyone who communicates differently from 'lowercase wtf ok riven op' is at risk of chat restriction too- that guy telling you to KILL YOURSELF just has to have his feelings hurt enough by it to report you back.
