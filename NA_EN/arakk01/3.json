There is NO human intervention required for a chat ban. Riot&#039;s Player Behavior team is not trained to read logs for context, they&#039;re trained to make you feel bad for wanting to enjoy their game. Your greatest chance of being perma-banned is if a Rioter doesn&#039;t like your off-meta pick when you play a game with them. In short: Riot is not invested in improving the community and making a great gameplay experience for everyone. They have their robot to mass-discipline on the cheap, and it&#039;s not a flawless system. They know that, but instead of clarifying their summoner&#039;s code in a way that would make them accountable for improving it, they keep it vague and refuse to acknowledge when players are punished for things outside the Code. \r\n\r\nWhen you ask support what you did wrong, the answer will almost certainly be &#039;tone&#039; or, in many cases, a copy-pasted text snippet that isn&#039;t remotely offensive when the context of the game is considered whatsoever. The real truth is that Riot&#039;s robot aggregates the chat logs of reported players for similarities, likely presenting those lists to a technician once in a while for parity checks, like a primitive neural network. There is no human intervention aside from making sure the data isn&#039;t corrupted or manipulated, if even that. Basically- if telling other players what to build, making objective calls, or calling out trolls regularly gets you reported by trolls, you WILL be punished for those behaviors, even if it&#039;s your first time doing them. Riot is OK with this.\r\n\r\nTL;DR: Riot hates you for talking. Just don&#039;t.","replies":[{"poster":"Chermorg","date":"2017-10-13T02:09:39.351+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot's player behavior team, as in, the one with actual people who study behavior for a living on it, has decided that in a game with a mute function, as well as a report function, **context doesn't matter**.\n\nIt doesn't matter if you're defending yourself against a flamer, or a troll, or a feeder... the other people on your (and the enemy) team have to deal with your toxicity. That's why you get punished for toxicity regardless of context - it simply doesn't matter. I don't care if your botlane is 0/10, or if you just died while your jungler was watching.. there is no excuse for toxicity other than ones ego and/or need for toxicity.\n\nThe Summoner's Code isn't vague at all - it's easily summed up: Don't be a dick. If you're having some competitive BS/trash talk? Fine. If you start berating your team for their performance, trying to give up, or otherwise not being positive and sportsmanlike, then it's not fine. I don't see what's so bad about wanting a calm, nice, enjoyable game of League.\n\nFurther, remember that the system is trained based on reports from players - and was originally trained (given a \"baseline\" so to say) by player cases in the Tribunal system, where players voted on whether other players' actions were punishable or not. When Riot issues you a punishment, it's a) based on reports in that game, and b) based on reports from many other games showing what players consider acceptable and not. If you are punished, it is Riot and the community telling you you're not being a fun sportsmanlike teammate/player.\n\nThe robot is simply doing what it was told to do - and it's **extremely** successful at that. It's so successful, in fact, that it sometimes issues punishments to players before they've even seen they got a prior punishment (i.e. while they're in a game and get a punishment in that game, then that game is worthy of a further punishment - those are removed on request by the way). Riot **does** acknowledge the very small (<0.001%) of cases that are wrongly punished, and they will remove such punishments very fast and admit the system messed up. The problem is the majority of the time, the system didn't mess up.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Silent Gravity","date":"2017-10-13T01:46:40.215+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can give advice, but telling other players what to build isn't your job.

Players unilaterally agree that gameplay toxicity is bad; the dividing issue on the playerbase is punishing otherwise innocent players for expressing their frustration in a harmless (aka mutable, verbal) fashion without personal attacks or hate speech. Your system is biased toward heavily communicative players; it clearly doesn't contextualize anything, from game-relevance to the amount of non-toxic communication a player puts forth. Not only that, but it suffers heavily from confirmation bias in that previously punished players are moderated more strictly- it's so bad as to feel like being harassed by yet another troll, except one employed by Riot Games. Completely innocent attempts to redirect a team making the wrong choices in no way ruin anyone's experience, and are only reported by intensely toxic players- but your system doesn't measure this context, either. In other words: Anyone who talks enough will be punished eventually, and that's not an OK stance to take.","replies":[{"poster":"Chermorg","date":"2017-10-13T03:11:16.844+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not really a dividing issue...\n\nMost tribunal cases back when it was a thing were decided with a strong (read >3/4 ratio) percent in favor of punish or not in favor of punish.\n\nThe community *virtually* unilaterally agrees that verbal toxicity is just as bad as gameplay toxicity.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ulanopo","date":"2017-10-13T12:12:07.417+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Anyone who talks enough will be punished eventually, and that's not an OK stance to take.\n\nThe numbers don't support that. It would be more correct to say that anyone who uses chat in an aggressive or confrontational way is likely to get punished at some point, but even then ~50% of punished players change their behavior after only a single punishment. The people who receive multiple punishments are those who decline to change.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the vast majority of players use chat in a way that is indistinguishable from a chat ban. They say \"GL, HF\", \"GG\" and might make one or two comments during the game, most of which are entirely gameplay related.\n\nI think the disconnect here mostly lives in people who believe their \"coaching\" is either welcome or helpful which, in general, is is definitely not.","replies":[{"poster":"Arakk01","date":"2017-10-14T03:39:58.622+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ulanopo,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=XOJW7sEB,comment-id=000400000001,timestamp=2017-10-13T12:12:07.417+0000)\n>\n> The numbers don&#x27;t support that.

Riot DOES hate players who interact with other players in chat, and prefers the ones who speak less. You justify this because toxic players who are unwilling to learn and improve their playstyle report players trying to give them advice.
