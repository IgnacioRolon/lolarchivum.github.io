They are justified, because they are points at which Sol is oppressive if successful, and do succeed at widening Sol's window of vulnerability AND reducing his potential damage output. However, as has been stated repeatedly here- double-tapping Q as a compensation buff would be the perfect place to compensate the champion. Let's focus on that: Double-tap Q for some power taken from W. Healthier, more interactive gameplay for Sol AND opponents. \n\n{{champion:136}} Aurelion Sol. A champion I, personally, have spent more than 100 games mastering- close to 200 if you count PBE. Currently on the chopping block AGAIN- for basically that exact reason. \n\nAurelion Sol\nCelestial Expansion (W) cooldown increased to 6/5.5/5/4.5/4 from 6/5/4/3/2\nVoice of Light (R) damage lowered to 150/250/350 from 200/300/400\n\nCurrently on the PBE, more SERIOUS nerfs to Aurelion Sol. Voice of Light is too powerful of a burst on a zone control champion- so I agree with **rebalancing** some or most of the power on that ability to other places- maybe letting him double tap his Q. \n\nWhat I don&#039;t agree with is essentially CRIPPLING his W. Why do I say &#039;crippling&#039;? Well, doubling the cooldown at max rank opens two of his weakest windows even wider. FIRSTLY, if a champion gets past his outer limit, a good Aurelion Sol&#039;s best answer to keep them from hitting him in the face is to close his ring of stars- usually applying Rylais if executed properly. This is followed by opening distance and opening his W again to turn the fight to his advantage- the other champion has to back off or try to go back in. This is a maneuver that saves my life more often than his ult, because it leaves his ult in reserve. Doubling his W cooldown makes it MUCH more difficult to pull off and opens a serious hole in his defenses. SECONDLY, Aurelion Sol&#039;s stars retreat to him for the duration of all CC. This toggles W off and puts it on cooldown- reducing his damage and zone of control until W returns, and forcing him to spend the toggle mana cost again. Effectively, nerfing W&#039;s cooldown is a double hit to Aurelion Sol at his primary weak points that can be mitigated by skillful play, chipping away at his skillcap instead of his base power. \n\nNow, that might not make sense to some of you. Sounds like nonsense, right? Why would you reduce the rewards for player skill instead of just weakening an OP champ for everyone? It has to do with Aurelion Sol&#039;s statistics. Namely, his PLAY RATE. Sol has a 1.1% play rate mid and less than a 1% play rate COMBINED everywhere else. The only people who play the champion are players who MAIN the champion- if word gets out that he has a high winrate, it will go down DRASTICALLY. It&#039;s the same exact reason both Karthus and Galio have comparable winrates- almost noone plays them, so anyone faced with the champion has no idea how to deal with it; by contrast, the few who do play them have dedicated time and SEVERAL normal/pbe games to mastering the champion. If you look any individual player&#039;s statistics, the champions they play most often always have high winrates- my winrate with Sol support is currently sitting at 60%; considering I&#039;m mid-bronze and my pick has a fair chance of instantly tilting teammates, that&#039;s fairly alright. \n\nReducing the availability of maneuvers that allow skillful Sol players to SURVIVE is not an acceptable answer. I agree with taking away some burst and sustained damage after being CC&#039;d, but the turning power of rapid W toggling combined with Rylais is too much to take out of his kit. It basically forces CDR into his build ASAP, regardless of how well Sol can use the items. On the flipside, the ability to turn a survival mechanic into a combat advantage is fairly powerful, and the gap in damage after taking CC is meaningful enough. \n\nOn the off chance that this ISN&#039;T motivated by a desire to keep Sol out of the LCS because his plays aren&#039;t always &#039;cool and flashy&#039;, I implore you: Either revert the W nerfs or compensate the champion by FIXING his Q. First: Fix its interaction with Wind Wall / Braum&#039;s Shield; the core should be the impact point, it shouldn&#039;t disappear the second the animation clips one of these effects. Second: Fix the bug that causes the ability to apply spell effects- like Spellthief&#039;s Edge- but not apply damage and/or the stun. This is one that quite often ruins fights for my entire team. Third: Allow double-tapping Sol&#039;s Q (or just cut the delay in half). This allows Q to be used more aggressively and more defensively- a way to make him interesting in the LCS. Allowing him to stun and retreat when someone gets on top of him is stronger defensively than his W maneuver, but doesn&#039;t pack the same fight-turning punch and closes the window to combo the abilities together; fixing his Q in this manner would make him less frustrating to play AS in the face of what would otherwise be a disgusting nerf.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2016-05-13T19:25:43.223+0000","up_votes":30,"down_votes":23,"body":"When balancing champions one of the primary statistics we consider is a champion's win rate when played by experienced players. Comparing average win rates can be really misleading as you point out, so comparing win rates when all the players involved have a decent level of experience on a champion tends to be more valuable for champions once they've been out for at least a little while.\n\nLooking at champion win rates for May when those champions are played by people with more than 30 games on them Aurelion Sol's got the highest experienced win rate in the game  and still has a lower average number of games played than many other champions, given he hasn't been out as long. He was strong before 6.9, and we were talking about whether he was sufficiently out of line we needed to nerf him. The 6.9 changes, Catalyst in particular, have pushed him to a point where don't feel we can afford to leave him as strong as he is, even if his play rate isn't high. \n\nIn terms of the changes we're making in 6.10 we're hitting the ult damage because, as a powerful initiation and/or peel tool it doesn't need to be as high as it is on base damage. That makes it a good place to hit when we need to reduce overall power. The W change is aimed at giving a bit more reward to opponents who CC Aurelion Sol or force him to pull his stars in (increased time until he's got longer ranged sustained threat again). It's possible that will hit him harder than intended in terms of ability to deal with closing threats, that is meant to be a core weakness for him though. We'll assess post 6.10 ship, see where he ends up. \n\nRegarding the bug you mention with his Q and Windwall/Braum do you have a video of the Q using its edge, instead of core, for Windwall/Braum shield collisions? Just had a look at that in game and I'm seeing the core used as expected. It does look like Braum E's blocking the CC on the Q though. It was scripted that to be consistent with Anivia's Q, that doesn't seem like the right approach here though, Braum at the least should be getting CC'd.","replies":[{"poster":"The Deckowner","date":"2016-05-13T22:00:29.028+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":13,"body":"The fact that aurelion sol's highest win rate playerbase is less experienced than other champions probably means his kit is very straight forward and lacks variations.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2016-05-13T22:52:22.681+0000","up_votes":33,"down_votes":2,"body":"It means that he's the most recently released champion.

Sure enough Lee Sin, Zed, Kalista require a lot more APM (let's say, mechanical skill) than Singed (press Q + run).\n\nHowever you also have to look at the game as whole. Lee Sin and Kalista are pretty much meta-agnostic champions (you could pick them at any time during any meta and they'd perform well enough). That is not the case for Singed. The mere presence of Singed in a game changes the way opponents and allies have to handle the map (think of him like a AP/Tank version of Tryndamere), entirely redefining their own picks roles. Thus, contrary to Lee Sin/Kalista, the simple fact of *picking Singed* requires a lot more game knowledge and mastery.\n\nThere are a few champions like Singed of course. Evelynn, Shaco, Twitch, Teemo are prime examples of this (I don't fully agree with Meddler on Rumble though, I believe he brings enough to the table regardless of the situation to bypass the \"meta knowledge\" requirement). They're probably the closest LoL has to « counterpicks ». Now whether *counterpicks* as previously discussed should become the standard in LoL is another debate - the same debate that allows Riven to bring nothing interesting to the game except the feeling to play a Street Fighter character.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"21028037DEL1","date":"2016-05-13T19:36:27.424+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"I appreciate the explanation.\n\nI am by no means an Aurelion Sol main and while I do approve of the nerf to his ultimate, I am concerned about this change:\n> \n> Celestial Expansion (W) cooldown increased to 6/5.5/5/4.5/4 from 6/5/4/3/2\n\nI think that it will be quite harsh, especially at later stages in the game when it will become difficult to react accordingly in the middle of a teamfight.

Maybe it takes 5 games to learn how to play against Aurelion Sol, but by definition those games are going to be spread out across 20-25 games, where you have 15-20 games in between where you don&#x27;t learn how to play against Aurelion Sol.\n> \n> In addition, when you play as a champion, you experience them for 100% of the time you are alive in game, where the playing against experience might be seen closer to 70-80% at the most, either because one player is dead or backed or there is impact going around the map, and that&#x27;s only when you lane against the champion. If you aren&#x27;t laning against the champion, you probably won&#x27;t spend more than 50% of the game fighting the champion.\n> \n> And that&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t account for differences in how different champions can deal with the champion (eg. artillery mages would want to hit Aurelion Sol outside his range while assassins would want to instantly close on him) and the skill differential between players (eg. a day 1 Aurelion Sol won&#x27;t be able to position his stars properly for damage while a more experienced Aurelion Sol player would space the stars perfectly for damage, and there&#x27;s no real value in learning to play against the champion when the former kind of player plays him), so you won&#x27;t be guaranteed to be able to know 100% how to play against a champion even if you do play those 5 games.\n\nThis is exactly how I see it too. Aurelion Sol is such a vastly different champ than any other champ that just the learning curve playing against him is far bigger than any other champ. I play Aurelion Sol quite a lot and probably 1/2 of the games i get all chat comments and questions on just exactly what aurelion sol even does. Im mid plat and people sit in his stars thinking they do nothing. I think until he gets more exposure he really can't be seen as op but merely as playing at an advantage of people not knowing the champ.\n\nPlus, it seems odd that there are such nerfs against a rarely played champ (if he's rarely played then he isn't dominating soloq and making it without diversity). Seems like more time could be put into nerfing champs like ryze, maokai, karma. Seems premature.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Stars Shaper","date":"2016-05-13T20:50:41.597+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The only champion I can make a comparison with is Azir.

I am getting the idea is that Aurelion Sol isn't intended to stand a very good chance against melee champions in general, especially melee champions who have a gap closer, stun, CC, a pull. Getting inside of his stars is rewarding enough because Aurelion Sol can't do anything to punish them outside of contracting his stars which equate to less damage and even less after the nerf. Then his R which creates some space but it has been nerfed twice now. \n\nYou aren't helping the champion at all in providing some sort of survivability. \n\nHis Q doesn't work on melee champions. Because it can't be detonated early. \nHe is now being punished on his 2 other spells for trying to combat melee in nerfing his W and R. \n\nFrankly I'm not sure there is a champion who has a counter pool anywhere near Aurelions. \n\nI could name at least  10 champions that are absolute nightmares to Aurelion.

This, if anything, proves that she has more 'basic power' in her kit but fewer opportunities for player skill to make a big difference. That is Sol's true strength in high-level play- his opportunities for player skill to turn games in his favor. Yes, his winrate is SOMEWHAT deflated by first-time Sol players- only about 8% of ALL Aurelion Sol players fall into the brackets that experience that 'second highest winrate'. The 92% with less than 10 games have between a 31% and a 53% winrate. 92% of Sol players fall in line with other champions, and the ones who don't are HARDCORE MAINS of the champion. Again, this is heavily due to his 1.1% PLAY RATE. \n\nChampion.gg recorded just 3400 Aurelion Sol mid games this patch out of TENS OF THOUSANDS played. With so few total games, with Sol only being picked because the players enjoy his playstyle, his winrate is indicative of any champ that while not popular, can hold its own.
