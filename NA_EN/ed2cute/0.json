We all know LoL is hilariously imbalanced. However, in a seriously competitive game, is it okay for it to be so imbalanced that you can have a champion jump smoothly between two completely opposite roles and/or fulfill both at the same time? Logically, when you see Lulu, Karma, and Morgana on the enemy team, \"Which one is mid?\" should not be a valid thought. The proper question would rather be, \"Wow wtf? 3 people fighting for support on their team and we had to force our last guy to pick it.\"\r\nThere are many imbalances in the game, but this one, I think, would be the easiest to fix. Simply remove the damage scaling or change it to scaling into something else. Supports are utility based, not assassins. So why do they have .8 ap ratios on their abilities?\r\nWhen this game was for fun, you could play it your way with Alistar top. But it's serious now.

I see no way that a champion can be equally strong in two positions that have different gold income (right now). Champions designed for the 0 CS position are compensated for the lack of gold by having more power in their kit. If those champions would gain more gold it can only cause problems (gold power + kit power = too much). Champions designed for high gold income on the other hand are just a lower version of themselves when played in the 0 CS position.In short: The 0 CS position (not champions) is just weaker than all other position. Right now this is compensated more powerful kits that only work in this position.\n\nOne way to solve this problem is by increasing the gold generation of the 0 CS position to be similar to high gold positions. While this may work I think it also makes the position a bit boring. More interesting would be a design like this:\n\n\n**utility** power of champion X in the 0 CS position **>** **utility** power of champion X in a high CS position\n\n**damage** of champion X in the 0 CS position **<** **damage** of champion X in a high CS position\n\n\nThis could be implemented like this (example!):\n\n**Ancient Coin**\nSomething special for abilities used on an allied Champion, like heals, shield or other buffs.\nExample: increase power of said abilities.\n\n**Spellthief's Edge**\nSomething special when you use CC on enemies.\nExample: reduce cooldowns by x seconds or %hp damage when triggered.\n\n**Relic Shield**\nSomething special for taking damage from enemy Champions.\nExample: Increase HP regeneration for x seconds.\n\n\nMore here: http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?p=45036113","replies":[]},{"poster":"Arizel","date":"2014-08-19T15:03:12.872+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If this is true, Why did you guys Begin to  completely removing AP/AD ratios from some champions?

Of course, I understand if you're not prepared to talk about this yet:\n\n#Part 1: Supports/Gold\nI've been in a number of interesting discussions recently regarding diversity of pick and strategy. I think a core issue holding back diversity right now is the gold income disparity. As long as certain roles have less gold than others, champs have to be balanced for those roles and then nerfed if they leave those roles (because, in order to survive on the lesser amount of gold, they need overloaded bases/kits, so if it ever turns out they can scale, their playstyle becomes unhealthy. *See fig. 1: Lulu*). **If roles had equal gold income, champions could be balanced *as champions, into niches,* instead of into roles.** I think Braum is a shining example of this. He's got a primary role as a bottom lane support, but he's also a decent toplaner, where he becomes a really, really, freakin' tanky disruption tank (getting his passive on everyone, forcing the enemy adc to focus him w/ his shield). \n---\n#Part 2: The Jungle\nAs an aside, Morello recently mentioned not being sure the direction that you want to take the jungle. If I might be so bold as to suggest one...\n\nI think the jungle should be the strategic core of league. The jungler should be calling objectives and rotations, and applying map pressure. They should ALSO feel like they are strong enough to make things happen, when they are present during pushes, etc, so powerfarming the jungler should be a viable strat as well.\n\nPressure can be applied in basically 3 ways:\n\n1. Ganking (duh)\n2. Invading the enemy jungle.\n  - It forces the enemy jungler to either counter-invade or ask his team for support to drive you out - all rotations, in a manner of speaking.\n3. Powerfarming your own jungle.\n  - Think FF release-era. If you let Yi powerfarm his jungle for 20 minutes, he comes out a monster, so it *forces* you to invade. Forcing map rotations = creating pressure.\n\nWhen you nerfed Feral Flare, you stated that \"it doesn't seem fair that a champ can powerfarm their jungle, where there's little risk, and then come out and wreck solo laners who have had to contend with an enemy while trying to cs.\" I think this wasn't actually the issue (OK, it was way too strong, my point is that the idea of \"junglers shouldn't be as strong as laners\" was incorrect). I think the issue was that the other strategy - ganking - wasn't rewarding enough, and the direct counter - invading - was too difficult.\n\nTherefore, here are my suggestions for a pre-season jungle rework:\n\n1. Increase jungle itemization to allow for carry-style junglers\n  - There should be jungle items for most combinations of: Early or Lategame; Tank or Damage; AP or AD.\n2. Make invading easier/more rewarding\nOptions I thought of:\n  - Give more or better-placed entrances/exits from the jungle\n  - Allow a jungler to cross from one side of the enemy jungle to the other without taking a tower hit would help this (he would be seen, though)\n3. Make ganking more rewarding (jungle items give bonus gold for kills or assists?)\n---\n#Part 3: Masteries\nThere are two ways to do this:\n\n1. Rework the utility mastery tree so *that's* where the gold that puts supports/junglers and CSers on even footing.\n2. Rework the utility mastery tree so it's more focused on utility. Supposedly, the deeper in the tree you go, the more applicable the points are to late game. However, many of the deeper (past 9) utility masteries are focused on the early game, and keeping supports' gold income/xp closer to CSers'.\n\nThanks for reading,\nHyrum Graff","replies":[]},{"poster":"KairosCrow","date":"2014-08-19T20:55:38.532+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"+1\nPlease, do move in this direction.

You can have a much more concrete goal in mind, creating a finer criteria by which that champion's balance is judged. Lulu, for example, is a very healthy champion when played as a duo lane support, but fudging that optimization by allowing her to scale off of AP more than a support typically would created a domineering solo lane beast that could bump off a lot of the competition. Of course, stuff like this is what I assume you're talking about when you say you want to maintain design values. AP Tryndamere is another area where this went wrong, if I recall, and it was properly addressed (even though people claimed it was just \"Riot killing creativity').\n\nFlexible champions (as in, champions who are flexible in their role by design, and were created with all the intentions that come along with that) certainly do have a place in the game, but letting people run rampant with experimental builds that become as optimal as what the designers had originally intended can cause harm outside of unhealthy play patterns (AP Trynd's clear 'n heal, AP Trist's 0 counterplay nuke kitchen), such as conflicting with the champion's intended playstyle and theming/fantasy (which tie into readability--AP Alistar being a hulking minotaur that...can bump into you for half your health but pops if you look at him?).\n\nAlso, if players are getting bored because they can't build a champion for more than one role, do you think there might be a bigger problem at hand? (By this I am implying that many champions--especially the older ones--are not very engaging/don't provide as wide a variety of gameplay experiences as they should/tend to be almost indistinguishable from others within their role, and while it's something that has started to become addressed with some of the recent gameplay updates, [it's still something that must be kept in mind](http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?p=49392988#post49392988))","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ed2Cute","date":"2014-08-21T21:08:33.503+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"omg it's Ghostcrawler. :O\n\nThe idea, in theory, is nice. To have any champion do just about anything. I mean, you pretty much just have that right now with Bruisers like Xin Zhao, Vi, and Lee Sin. Get a single damage item and go full tank bruisers are like, \"Lol what adc? lol what mid? lol what enemy team?\" And it's extremely annoying because tank Vayne or tank Ahri isn't gonna do anything but be a hindrance. While damage Vayne and Ahri aren't gonna do anything because they're dead.\n\nAlso, having any champion fill any role makes it even more boring. Half of the fun is picking a team-comp that works. Getting your adc, top, jungle, etc. And having players play that role well vs. the same thing. Then it's a game of skill if it's adc vs adc.\n\nHaving any champ do anything ruins strategic positioning. I mean, right now you can make a huge play on a 4v5 when the enemy wants to split-push or just went back. But if role doesn't matter, then you'll just have 4 durable cc bots smacking 5 durable cc bots and whichever group of cc bots has more gold at the moment wins because they'll probably have more items.\n\nI know what I'm saying sounds like I'm only looking at one possible result and... well I am. It's just like when One-For-All: Mirror Mode happened. That game mode could not be more balanced. It was 100% skill the max, baby. You had everything they had, and they had everything you had. Who was smarter at builds and who was better at mechanics decided the victor. Buuuut then we saw what the League community did. \"Pick Nidalee/Ziggs. Let's play dodge ball.\" And a meta was born looking for easy wins and it became stale. Just like if any champ can do anything, the people will just say, \"Oh well go bruisers. If they go damage, combined with our tankiness, they can't outdamage us. GG.\"\n\nIt will take FAR more balancing work to be done to change every champion into puddy that you can shape to what you want than to assign champions a role and let them play that role. Champion changing involves changing every aspect of the game. What we have now is the TEAM concept that's getting a little out of hand. It's easier to real it back in than to go back to the drawing board and change the foundation of the game.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ed2Cute","date":"2014-08-15T17:57:08.055+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"By \"run the ball\" I mean with it in their hands.

One spell and they're completely useless. And the meta is just full of it. You can have like 14 roots and stuns on your team with the right comp. And that has literally no defense. At most 4 can be cleansed if you're Olaf/Gankplank. And the items/abilities that cleanse it have a much longer cc than the actual cc does. So they WILL get you pretty much no matter what. And not playing the game (because you're cc'd to death) isn't fun.\n\nRiot knows it's a problem. That's kind of why they got rid of Ryze and a few others in URF Mode.

You actively cannot be a bruiser with a ranged character because they simply don't fit the definition of the role. All bruisers are melee. Even they are sometimes ranged (like Gnar or Nid), they can still transform into a melee form. Some of the definitions are quite flexible (like 'support', which merely means 'any champion that obtains gold from a specific item instead of csing'), but other definitions are very clear. Bruiser (or fighter) is one of them. It's not that you can't build AD and tanky Karma, it's that she can't be a bruiser because she's ranged *and she can't stop being ranged*. Marksperson is another similar definition, they are all ranged. You cannot play Fiora as a marksperson, even though you CAN play her in bot lane as your AD carry.\n\n> League isn't about fun. Riot is all about that e-sports scene right now.

That's why not every game is some wild cacophony of everything players want. There's a reason why games ban hackers/cheaters/modders. And they're still highly successful.\n\nThe reason games ban hacking and cheating is because it's unfair to other players who lack those resources. Many games have extremely active modding communities, and modding the game becomes one of its main selling points (such as Skyrim or any of the TES series games). Other games instead are all about the choices that you make and actively promote diversity in order to increase the range of choice (such as simulators, RPGs, strategy games).\n\n> If \"their thing\" makes the game basically a 4v6, yeah it ruins the shit out of my fun.\n\nI can play a perfectly meta pick and still do as horribly as the guy who picked something different. Both us are making the game basically a 4v6 due to our utter incompetence. Why is my failure more forgivable than his, simply because I chose to obey the meta and he didn't?\n\n1) Yes, story and content are sources of *diversity*, which keep the game interesting and fresh. As you say it yourself, once you've seen everything the game has to offer, you feel no need to play it again. That's exactly what would happen if you shackled the game down with restrictions.\n2) I completely and utterly disagree. There is no need to think about anything if you already know which champion belongs to what role and who is the best champion at it. It's simply a matter of who has the most mechanical skill. Counters are irrelevant, because once you discover who is the best ADC and who is the second best (or his counter), the entire meta sorts itself out. You get absolutely no choice. First pick picks the best ADC, second pick picks his counter. May the most mechanically practised player win.\n3) The ability to choose different champions in different roles is based on your understanding of the game at large, of your creativity, strategy and teamwork with the other players. Lulu is not designed to top, and she'll never beat her opponent in lane (she'll just stall forever) but if her player understands all the things I mentioned previously, he can turn her into a teamfight asset by mid and late game, allowing her to act as a disruptor with tremendous peel for her carries. Team-wide, this may compensate for an unusual choice in support, for example. All these ways of looking at the game holistically and inventing new strategies cannot happen if you force rigid restrictions upon the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Ed2Cute","date":"2014-08-22T07:02:45.093+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":">because you obtain the same result with both.\n\nYeah, I could walk from Utah to Texas to see my mother and sister... or I could fly.

But this fucker AD Bruiser Karma top lane threw caution to the wind and said he's doing what he wants no matter how stupid it is.\n\n1.) No, because even now the reason League isn't stale is because every game have a new setup of players and champions and so it's a new experience getting to the same goal. What you're trying to explain is Caitlyn vs Vayne on Howling Abyss every single match always. Just one person versus one person. One playing Caitlyn, the other playing Vayne. THAT would be stale. THAT would crash League's community.\n2.) But it's not only vs that ADC. And no shit, that's how a game based on skill should be, best player wins. Wtf are you complaining about \"skill matchup is so dumb\" for? This game isn't Rock'Em Sock'Em robots, m8. And I don't care if Lucian is the best ADC and Ashe isn't his counter if I land that arrow on someone and my team nukes them and anyone else that tries to get frisky when we're taking the base.\n3.) Yes, they absolutely can happen. They just can't happen with your support not being a support. Like, I'm not complaining that Lulu goes top. I'm complaining that she can make me her bitch when she's supposed to be a damn support and not an assassin/bruiser/fighter.\nAnd if any champ can fill any role, there won't be strategy either. Everyone will just make a 15 CCs comp, go high damage, cc the enemy to death, and end the game. It would be so easy and the game would get boring and stale because you'd be in champ select, see they got Maokai, Alistar, and some other heavy cc dude and then you'd just drop champ select because that's a loss.","replies":[{"poster":"ShadowKnight1224","date":"2014-08-22T09:35:14.040+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Yeah, I could walk from Utah to Texas to see my mother and sister... or I could fly.

There are many characters, such as Fiora and Master Yi, who are fragile glass cannon assassins with a lot of upfront damage, and that doesn't make them bruisers. To further clarify the definition, bruisers are usually tankier than assassins and need more time to deliver the same amount of damage that an assassin can deliver in a burst.\n \n> That's not competitive. It's incomprehensible pile character models.\n\nAnd I would argue that the absence of choice generated by petty restrictions is not a game but a system to test mechanical skill.\n\n> And the games that have modding as their main selling point are hardly a game at all.

The customisation in the Saint's Row games has been critically acclaimed. The Sims are an extraordinarily lucrative franchise. RPGs and other types of simulators have a loyal following (particularly brand-name RPGs).\n\nCampaigning against something that doesn't harm anybody simply because you don't like it is rather selfish and petty.\n\n> Yeah, pretty much. Picking a meta pick or taking a champion where it is understood they go means you made a conscious effort to win the game at least in the beginning. But this fucker AD Bruiser Karma top lane threw caution to the wind and said he's doing what he wants no matter how stupid it is.\n\nWhy do you assume that any non-meta picks are innately less effort-based than meta picks? It strikes me as the complete opposite. If you are taking someone who is not meant to be somewhere, you have to be *more* cautious and prepared, not less. You need to surmount the difficulty of being outside your ideal zone, which requires extra effort in your part. It requires more practice to excel outside your meta role than to excel within.\n\n1) If we had it your way, we'd end up with that on a larger scale. There would be 1 top ADC, then second best (or her counter), then 1 top support and second best (or counter), and so on for every role. Every single match would be a combination of 16 champions, accounting for bans (and don't think that bans would keep this interesting, there would be a mathematical equation for which champion is most beneficial to ban if you don't have first pick).\n\n2) We've been over this before. Skill is more than its mechanical component. Arbitrary restrictions on roles would reduce League's definition of skill to \"purely mechanical\".\n\n3) That's a problem with the champions, not the roles. If a champion has too much CC, damage and tankiness, then they have too many strengths and not enough weaknesses. That's a problem with the champion specifically, and he must be nerfed in a specific area to give him weaknesses. If you pick a high-cc teamcomp, you should have either no damage or no tankiness, in order to give your team a meaningful weakness. That's a problem with the balance department that has no bearing on roles.","replies":[{"poster":"Ed2Cute","date":"2014-08-22T18:08:32.422+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Replace \"walk\" with \"drive\" and you have a roadtrip.

Look at chess, HearthStone, StarCraft, any strategy game ever. Your pieces, minions, etc. all do a specific thing. Strategy comes in when you use them at the right time in the right way instead of summoning Kuriboh and being like, \"Oh and now it fucking has black hole and it's not effected by it.

One of it's defining features is that it is stupid. League is a *serious* game.

It's probably the most limited thing on your list in it's raw code. Your Sim has to get a job, has to eat, has to clean, etc. Unless you cheat, your freedom is actually pretty limited.\nYou're so limited in RPGs and *especially* simulators. Flight simulator is you flying a plane, end of game. Train simulator is you conducting a train, end of game. Those better support my statements than yours.\n\n>If you are taking someone who is not meant to be somewhere, you have to be more cautious and prepared, not less.\n\nNo, it's less cautious because you *know* the risks of taking it there and you said \"Fuck it, I'm doing it.\" You purposefully put yourself in a disadvantageous spot because it was fun(ny)? And imagine putting that practice into a meta champ and taking it where it goes. Probably get way better results.\n\n1.) You obviously don't understand how balance works. Lucian has weak range, but lots of mobility so there are champs that can deal with that. Targeted/well timed CC and any adc with more range, sustain, or trading ability. There's not just one adc who ranks above the others if you do it right. And making Lucian go against a fully effective tank Caitlyn is not intelligent game design. That's trying to just let another carry not die to their opponent.\n2.) NO, IT WOULDN'T! Not fucking diving 1v5 into dragon pit does not matter what champion you are! It's a stupid decision no matter what.\n3.) That has every bearing on roles because tanks and supports are supposed to be utility and carry the cc. But high burst mages like Syndra and Ahri have strong cc as well. And Ashe has strong cc too. You can have an effective team comp with 15 cc and no blaring weakness.","replies":[{"poster":"ShadowKnight1224","date":"2014-08-22T23:23:06.878+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"From what I gather from your posts, you have a profound disrespect for people who don't do things the way you would do them.

The Q hitbox is huge and is a 3 second root while her ult is a pretty strong slow that turns into a stun. And Riot is \"working on it\" but they think her shield was the overpowered thing in her hit. If just about anyone has to pick one, they'd say the Q hitbox is too fucking huge.","replies":[{"poster":"Knight SoIaire ","date":"2014-08-16T10:31:02.417+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> No, Lulu top is good against just about everyone.

She could push to hell, was difficult to gank, and could mitigate a lot of damage and turn tower dives very easily. Most mids are assassins, and the only one who could really instantly 100-0 her without any reaction speed mattering from Lulu was LeBlanc... but now her silence is gone. :(\n\n>riot wants to nerf her as a support without gutting her as a midder\n\nWhich is stupid. Morgana is a support. Everything about her kit is a support. Magic/CC barrier, long root, debuff aoe, and team slow/stun. She is literally a support. She's not a mid because her Q travels too slowly and is too easily blocked by minions (when there is but one real target). Like yeah she could push like damn hero, but her shield wasn't really enough to save her from ganks and Q is too unreliable to put that much need for it to hit on it. She would need a huge rework in order to be a mid. Probably even more drastic than Karma.","replies":[{"poster":"Knight SoIaire ","date":"2014-08-17T07:26:51.724+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"riot made a midder named morgana asnd they want to keep her as a midder \njust like they made ad yi and they wanted to keep him as an ad champion","replies":[{"poster":"Ed2Cute","date":"2014-08-18T03:36:23.107+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Just like made Evelynn an AP Melee assassin and they kept her- oh wait.","replies":[{"poster":"Knight SoIaire ","date":"2014-08-18T13:07:43.193+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"evelyn is a problem because perma invisibility is toxic \nriot cant make her a proper assasin cause it would be too stronk and toxic (look at the constant gutting and reworking rengar when he can go stealt only for like 10 seconds) so she took a wave of nurfs to the knee","replies":[{"poster":"Ed2Cute","date":"2014-08-18T18:29:14.189+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"What I'm actually pointing out is that she runs tanky AD now.

Making it a competitive scene means that Darius is a tanky AD champ and building him full AP \"for teh lolz\" should not be encouraged. And his scaling with either tank or ad should be limited so as to keep him from going hybrid but being as effective, if not stronger, than the champions who are designed to only build tank OR AD.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
