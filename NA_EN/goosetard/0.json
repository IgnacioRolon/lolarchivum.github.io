It has:\r\n64 GB ram\r\nXeon Processor 3.1GHz 3.1GHz\r\nNVidia Quadro K5000\r\n\r\nThis thing is a beast. It's worth more than my car. But no matter what graphics settings I run at, maxed out or \"minned\" out, it always runs a high fps but skips a few frames every so often. It's really disorienting and makes it difficult to play. It's almost like the computer is tripping over itself.\r\n\r\nHelp?","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-05-24T21:24:21.376+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think your particular problem is due to the fact that the computer might be TOO powerful.  When left unchecked, League can act weirdly at extremely high FPS.  Make sure that your framerate is capped at a consistent FPS (such as 120).  if that still doesn't help, make sure to toggle your Vertical Sync option to see if that helps steady your FPS as well.\n\nLet me know if this doesn't help out at all!","replies":[{"poster":"Goosetard","date":"2016-05-25T20:59:00.748+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok so I played a couple of customs today. I did already have the settings in place that you recommended, so I was using them before (framecap, vsync). It occured *far less* than I remember, even using the settings that it was left on from last time, so some patch at some point must have helped. It still occurs, however. I noticed that it occurs more often (but not consistently) when:\n\n* I pan the view to a part of the map I haven't looked at yet\n* Particle effects associated with minions spawning or turrets doing the... thing (?) they do at the start of the game\n* Abilities like Shyvana E or Vel'Koz W the first time I use them in a game (and sometimes, but rarely, after)\n* Victory screen nexus explosion\n\nIt's not just a frame skip, it's like the whole computer freezes for a split second and then unsticks. It even happens if I'm alt-tabbed out of client.\n\nOther notes:\nRunning borderless windowed mode and have a dual screen setup.\n\nThanks very much in advance for any help you can provide","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-05-25T22:07:37.428+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Very glad to hear that it helped to a point!

Thanks so much for the help!\n\nI peeked through the r3d files. I saw fairly regular errors for missing assets here and there where it looks for something and creates a default texture instead. Is that normal? I imagine that you guys don't always tie up loose ends that may be used later from patch to patch.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Goosetard","date":"2016-05-25T01:59:07.195+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for the reply!\n\nTo the best of my recollection, I tried capping fps at 60 and keeping vsync on to no avail, but it's been some time so I'll give it another try tomorrow.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Suntv","date":"2016-05-24T21:17:52.064+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been having fps hiccups as well for the past 2-3 days and it has been very weird. I posted on the forums but all I've been getting were views and no responses.\n\nI did an fps troubleshooting, cleared a crap ton of space on my computer and even re installed the client. No change at all. This problem causes my champion to freeze for about 2-8 seconds or until I am dead in team fights. Kind of fed up with it. Have been on the forums ever since and I havent found a solution yet. Also, my video graphics are all set to it's lowest.","replies":[]}]}
