I went through the guide; I'm already using a wired connection to my router. I don't have software firewalls. The netalyzr tool showed pretty extreme packet loss (~10%) for periods during which my connection was behaving poorly. That section of the connection guide seemed to boil down to \"sorry your isp sucks\" (lol I'm sorry, too). There are some things I didn't investigate, like DNS settings, that (as far as I know) shouldn't cause intermittent problems--it'd be a constant issue or it's always fine. I can look into those too if you like.\n\nSince this problem wasn't constant, I don't change my settings, and it goes away without me doing anything (resetting modem, etc.) I assumed it was a problem with my ISP and not in my network. I was mostly curious exactly what the phenomenon is that causes this (apparently it's packet loss). Thanks very much for looking into it anyway!","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-16T23:43:59.825+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It certainly sounds like there are issues along your route to the server, especially if netalyzr is reporting packet loss. These issues often occur along specific *nodes* or \"hops\" along your path to the server. This can be an issue on either your ISP or the backbone provider they partner with in order to get your connection to our servers. I strongly recommend completing the rest of the connection guide prior to use taking an in-depth look at your route.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions.","replies":[{"poster":"Goosetard","date":"2016-10-18T05:54:32.016+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alrighty, I'll do that.
