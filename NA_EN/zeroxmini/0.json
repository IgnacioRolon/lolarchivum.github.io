I know this is absolutely horrid but its all I have at the moment. I can connect to League just fine but its obviously slow. However, my average ping for League is about 1800. I don't get why my ping is 800 higher on League than what I should have. Could it be the location of their servers?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-28T00:51:56.712+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You could be onto something with your suspicions on it being the location of the server or how your connection is being routed.
