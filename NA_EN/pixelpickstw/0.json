I am not a very good player, I&#039;m about average. Finishing out my ranked series it looked like all I needed to get into silver this season was win my last of 10 ranked games. I played valiantly, coordinated with my team, died a little bit more than I would have liked, but we won the game in the end. \r\n\r\nHere I am having just finished my ranked placements, thinking my MMR would be high enough to get silver, and then I see I have been placed in Bronze 1. I am now minorly discouraged, not due to any fault on Riot&#039;s part (I honestly don&#039;t feel like I&#039;m entitled to any rank) but due to my own high expectations. Sadly now, I have to win several games and make it through a best of 5 promo, all in the span of about a month, to achieve my goals.\r\n\r\nTL;DR I overestimated how much impact my MMR has on my placements, so now I&#039;m Bronze and it makes me sad.","replies":[]}
