The average player is below low gold 4 so why would a new player start with higher mmr than an average player who has likely been playing for multiple seasons.  Yeah maybe if there is a smurf they will be better than that but the system shouldn't try to cater to smurfs.  If a new player were to start with low silver mmr that would likely place them much closer to the rank they truly deserve off the bat.  Currently if you win 3/4 of your placement games you will be out of bronze.  It would ruin far less games for someone who is genuinely new to the game to start low and climb as they improve rather than start higher and fall down to where they should start ruining games for others in the process.  And it really sucks for them as well because they just get flamed for trying their hardest despite the problem being a flawed system.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-11-02T01:57:31.657+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gold 4 is the 50% mark, supposedly.\n\nIt is a bit odd, though.

You want a rank to have a actual relation to skill and not just a representation of a investment of time? \nThen its on a curve.\n\n\nThe basics. There are only 2 outcomes in a game. Win or loss. Equal probability. You have 2 games? Game 2 has same possible outcomes. Win or loss, But probability becomes a thing. Because not every combination is equally likely.\n\n1 game. 2 outcomes. W or L.   50% \n2 games? WW Wl LW LL. 4 possible combinations, 1 win and 1 loss overlap for WL and LW. So 50% you see a 1W1L Player.  25% for WW 25% LL.\n3 games, 8 possible combinations of results. 12.50% 37.50% 37.50% 12.50%  3-0 and 0-3 are far less common then 2-1 and 1-2.\n4 games. 16 combinations. WWWW LLLL being 6.25% each of the possible combinations.\n\nSo for a \"fair\" game you would assume 50% odds. Both sides equal ability to win. When that's not true? That's how and why some one sees a raiting change. Your results are not matching what most likely to occur. Your above or below average.\n\nAt Low Data? Yes its pretty RNG. However you can't magically know how good some one is with out measuring it, judging it, Rating it. So As you add more and more numbers the curves get more pronounced. This is literally how Casinos make their money, \"House always wins\"  The numbers are set in games to give the House an edge and make it so the most commonly occurring event is them making a profit.\n\nRoulette for example.  You have Red or Black that would be a 50/50 Bet if not for house advantage, the table also has 0 or 00 at which point house wins.  So instead of 50%, (Reduced 18/36 and you get 1/2 which is 50%)  You see It be 18/38 no matter if your betting on Red or Black, Odd or Even, High or Low. \n\nKind of a drawn out way to say something that's pretty \"duh\", the things that are most likely to happen are the things that happen most often.\n\nSo regardless of what \"Rank\" it is. The starting value in Elo and MMR will be the majority player, the most common level of skill, the average level of skill.  Below average will sink, Above will climb.  If you have that math in place and make the \"bottom\" of the ladder your starting point?\n\nRoughly 50% of all the games players are going to be stuck in that division and there is no title for the gap in skill. Iron 4 would be a majority of players, and the \"skill gap\"  between iron 4 would be the equivalent of everything from current I4 to roughly Silver 2 (MMR is not made to be zero sum.)\n\nIt gets more complicated as you go on, not less.","replies":[{"poster":"Ambitious Minnow","date":"2019-11-03T17:55:42.310+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You added literally nothing of value to the conversation here, like one of this people that gets all confused when the math is rolled into a word problem.\n\nThe starting point for ranked being in the middle of the skill distribution _only makes sense if all players are regularly starting from scratch in ranked._ But that's not how it works.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of \"new\"players are exactly that, new or generally inexperienced.

When that not met then rating changes to reflect it.  When there is a consistent trend of failed expectations you see some one climb or sink.  More dramatic early on, lowers with # of games.\n\nFor Elo adjustment is Rn=Ro+K(W-We) at its most basic representation. \nRn is your Rating after a game. \nRo was what MM used to make the match.\n  W is win or loss, its a positive or negative value. \nWe is system expectation and its for mismatches. I believe in MMR its independent to the game average cuz MMR is not Zero sum but I do not have full confidence to state that as an established fact or assure you Riot does so. It might only be a factor if the teams are uneven rather then relevant every game.\n  K just multiplies the result of W-We and thus controls how much the Max R you gain/lose will be.

That's a common view. \nLet me guess, You call it a streak at 3-4 games? That's also a common. You tell me when you start to count a streak.\n\n  But 2 games is technically a streak. Why not use that? Does it feel just a bit low?  Don't want to use the absolute minimum value. How much better is 3 at as the second lowest option?\n\nI ask folks to learn the math becuase it matters. If you want here is the breakdown.\n\nTo make it easy in the examples I am using 2  as a streak. The combinations of possible results in 2 games are WW,WL,LW,LL. Now 1 win 1 loss as a result is higher odds, as the order does not impact it. 50% see a result of 1w1l. 25% 2w 25% 2l. But 2l and 2w is a streak so 50% streak vs non streak. Elo is probability. Its a curve. 25% 50% 25%. Streaks? 50% 50% they dont match up at all. Its going to get worse not better.\n\n3 games? 2^3= 8. 3w or 3l is 2/8 reduced thats 1/4 = 0.25=25% to see a streak of 3 going eather direction. If we stop here, looks like the % went down right? But I am counting and looking for 2 game streaks not 3 games. That's also WWL.LWW.WLL.LLW. 3w 3l are still streaks and WLW.LWL. are not good. So 2/8. Are not a streak and 6/8 are. 75% you will  see a streak. Probability curve is a mix made of 3l 2l1w 2w1l 3w. So. 1/8 3/8 3/8 1/8 =12.5% 37.5% 37.5% 12.5%\n\n4 games 2^4. 16 possible combinations. Only 2 combinations don't have a streak. WLWL and LWLW. So 14/16 = 7/8 = 87.5% odds to find a streak.\n\nAt 5 games you hit 32 possible results.

Your history is available for ranked games [here](https://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-history/NA1/223939359?matchType=2).  Going back to Season start I found streaks counting at 8+ to be 9W streak Starting on (S)7-23  Ending on (E) 7-22 \n9l Streak  S: 7-31 E: 8-4\n 9L S: 9-14 E: 9-16 \n 8l  S:10-7 E 10-8  \n8l S:10-27 E: 10-29\n\nSo a total of 34 for games total in a streak of 8 or more. Out of W262 and  L267   \nBreak down into %.  Overall 34/529 so 0.064 Rounded into 6% of your total games.  Given loss streaks seem to be the majority, and are also the ones that suck the most to experience seems fair they stand out to you as negatives.\n\nIf we used 10 games it would be 0%.  If we used 7 as a start instead of 8 there would be a more streaks.  2 would add a fuck ton of streaks and 3 is just the next one up.\n\nI am not seeing 15 or 10 for ranked play this year but I think that was likely you going off memory then you trying to intentionally be deceptive, its a pain in the butt to go over every game in some ones history.   I think your values aren't really a big deal of an exaggeration because personally  \"loss streak\"of even 3 feels like an eternity of shitty matches and i am some one who expects seeing that.\n\nI don't know why more people don't play support or at least learn the basics for the role, but im of the opinion you should learn the basics for each and every champion in the game, otherwise your gonna need to learn it on the fly mid game.\n\nSo, I tried to ensure the numbers I gave you are in line with reality.
