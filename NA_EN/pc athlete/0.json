As it is right now, I play with V-sync on, since it is the setting which feels most smooth to me. The problem is even though it feels smooth, big teamfights hits hard on the FPS. If I play with uncapped fps and V-sync off, I get around 100-200 fps, but it doesn't feel nearly as smooth as V-sync, it's almost like the game stutters. I've also tried to cap the fps at 80, 140 etc, but it doesn't seem to fix the issue. Is my system just not optimal enough to run league of legends, or are there some settings I can change in order to fix the problems.\r\n\r\nI run all settings on medium expect shadows which is turned off.\r\n\r\n\r\nSpecs:\r\nCPU: i5-4570 3.20 GHz\r\nGPU: GTX 1060 6GB\r\nRAM: 8 GB\r\n\r\n\r\nHelp is appreciated :D","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-28T18:22:42.854+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My first recommendation would be to try capping your frames, but it looks like that didn't work.
