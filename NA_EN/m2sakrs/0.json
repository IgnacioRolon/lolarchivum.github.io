I have zero sympathy for trolling. \n\n\nEdit:\nI also took a look at your game, and I doubt very much that you only trolled for 30 sec.\n\nYou had a score of 0/21/4, you were dying every time you re-spawned up until 20min, and at the 20min mark you only had 7cs.","replies":[{"poster":"REDCOLORED","date":"2018-04-13T13:32:19.461+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"AeroWaffle","date":"2018-04-13T13:36:49.344+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your punishment is about your behavior, no one else's.\n\nIf I was picking an off-meta support and my lane-partner said that they would troll (and followed through), I would take the CS as well.
