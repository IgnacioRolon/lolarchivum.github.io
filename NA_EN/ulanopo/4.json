He was pretty good at his champion, but my god did he talk trash. Every time he would get a kill he would spam \"dogs\", \"woof woof\", \"how do I increase the bot difficulty?\" \"ez\", you know, things a typical Yasuo main would say. At first it was funny bantering with him but after 25 minutes of him spamming the same shit in chat I got annoyed and muted him so I could actually concentrate.\n\nNever did I feel more obligated to win a game before - the guy was genuinely trash talking harder than you would believe. Whenever a kill of any sort was made, he'd be the first to type about it, also constantly calling our jungler a rat because he ganked his lane. \n\nWe ended up winning the game at 45 minutes because the enemy support was afk but god you better believe it was the most satisfying win of my life. Even more satisfying when I almost instantly got an \"instant feedback report\" for reporting the Yasuo for his constant trashtalk.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Six Inch Heals","date":"2019-12-26T05:14:24.415+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What a present indeed.
