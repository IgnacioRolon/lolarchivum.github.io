I faced a tanky team with Nautilus support and was completely ineffective. I'm glad that Sona's early game was so oppressive that it had to be nerfed. I'm genuinely curious what I'm supposed to do against tanky supports. Am I supposed to stand in back and give my ADC \"awesome power\" by buffing one AA and helping push the lane?\n\nAlso, E was wholly unsatisfactory. I had three ranks in it plus tier two boots and I couldn't outrun anyone. \n\nAnd... BaronReplays couldn't catch it because the server was acting up. Great.\n\nYou know, I was on the fence before this match, thinking that maybe I just hadn't given the rework enough of an opportunity. I don't think that way any more. I don't know who you had playtesting it, but I can tell you that it's completely awful for me.\n\nEDIT: Fearless, if you're reading this, I really feel like the lane nerfs were a stupid idea and I hate using that word. Part of my job as a support is to help shepherd my ADC into the mid-late game and I don't feel that I can do that. I can't remember when I was angrier with League. These matches have been utterly frustrating. I may not be a great player, but I don't suck either and it feels like I can't do anything. At every turn I feel useless and like I'm a liability to my team.","replies":[{"poster":"Gaston du Coteau","date":"2014-08-03T01:40:57.224+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":17,"body":"The lane nerfs were absolute insanity.

Sona's maximum single rotation burst went down but I can't see what she gained. Every time I go in with Hymn of Valor/AA poke, tanky supports like {{champion:89}} {{champion:79}} {{champion:201}}  just shrug it off, especially if they're rocking a {{item:3302}} . The only way I was able to keep supports like that at bay was that early level 1 damage and constantly keeping them afraid. I cannot do that now because not only is the damage weaker, my mana can't support it due to increased costs. This has all been said before but I have yet to hear the why.\n\nWhy lower Sona's personal damage output? Sona was all about smartly poking in the early game and you were rewarded with low health enemies and punished with death if you got caught. Now, you're still punished with death but your reward is an opponent at 75% health. That strikes fear into no-one. I recall a comment that you guys didn't want Sona to burst too hard, but unless she was building full AP in the early game, burst was never lethal, it still isn't. Yet, now her sustained damage is lower (prolonged fights early game). \n\nNote: I'm referring to the loss of 50 base damage on Valor and -50% Power Chord: Staccato damage.","replies":[{"poster":"Kynami","date":"2014-08-04T04:34:47.605+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its actually higher than that.

She needs to keep her team coordinated and nearby, opening them up to AoE damage and Bouncing abilities (Pyroclasm, Dark Wind, etc).\n\nWith the loss of her heals Armor and MR bonuses, she's become very easy to kill with an All-In. \n\nQ's new aura only provides a single boosted attack per approximately 8 seconds, and doesn't add AD for the sake of Critical Hits or Abilities. The old auras usefulness depended on your ADCs Attack Speed and Critical Chance. Additionally, the boosted auto attack isn't very useful to mages, making her less of a team player and more of an ADC accessory. The Power Chord nerf was appropriate, but it would be nice if it scaled back up to double power with rank or Crescendo to keep her relevant late.\n\nThe changes to E are absolutely fantastic and I love them.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Sotere","date":"2014-08-03T22:59:25.376+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":11,"body":"I think Sona was deceptively hard to play even before these changes. The kit told you to stay in the back and be safe, but you needed to get in the thick of things for timely Crescendos. Likewise, Power Chords were and are powerful enough that they entice you into enemy auto-attack range.  Positioning was extraordinarily important and sometimes deceptive as to the best use case.\n\nI do think you're right in that the skill floor has crept up. Also, because her power is more clearly being donated to allies, it's easy to see when you are unsuccessful with her new positioning.  The purpose of updates is rarely to give a champion more power, so there is always the risk of disheartening people who have less success while learning new mechanics. If the problem persists beyond a brief learning curve, then we have to evaluate further and solve said problem.","replies":[{"poster":"FaerKhan","date":"2014-08-03T23:44:20.999+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":3,"body":"Power being donated to allies is always going to make a champion feel terrible to play.

She's never going to be fun to play if this is the way her plays are going to be \"impactful.\" I thought the goal of this rework was to make her power more fun for her summoner so that Sona players could feel more useful? Buffing teammates is fun, but being able to do nothing by yourself isn't fun. (which is why everyone hated the ward bot meta) \n\nOn top of that, you Rioters need to stop bashing old Sona mains' play of the champion that they know better than you do.

She already gave AD and AP before which provided drastically higher DPS.  Players will only benefit from Hymn if they're able to auto-attack and only if Sona can get close enough to press her bosom against them to apply the effect in the first place.  AA-based champions prioritize AS, they won't care much if a singular hit does slightly more, especially if it's unaffected by crit chance.  Skill-based champs will string in an auto here and there, but the main source of their DPS is abilities which gain no benefit at all.  On the low-end of the spectrum, long-range mages that can't risk getting into AA range at all have lost all boosts from Sona entirely.","replies":[{"poster":"FaerKhan","date":"2014-08-04T01:35:18.131+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreed.

Sona's ult is powerful, but no more than Nami's is, and I don't see Nami getting gutted for it. Why hold back the power budget so significantly when clearly you are already cutting into a borderline under-tuned champion's power?

They need to be passionate about games and have a deep understanding of game mechanics, but they don't actually need to be good at games.\n\nPeople play games in ways the developers never intended for a lot of the time. That's why there is strong internal testing before any game's release - a developer is completely, utterly incapable of predicting how something will turn out with 100% accuracy until it's actually been played. Experience can only take you so far as far as prediction goes, and people are always capable of surprising you with new ways to not do what you thought they would.\n\nSo it's not the developer who needs to be super good at the game. It's the testers - the ones who check things before they even hit the PBE - who need to be good at the game. (And who need to be bad at the game, you need to see how something will behave in both low and high elo.)\n\nAn even better example than Sona of something that was poorly tested before it went live would be Lucian and his changes in, I think, 4.12. That should have never left the PBE, yet it did, and it ended up being such a gigantic buff that Lucian was disabled in the LCS.\n\nTesters are the ones who push everything to its limits. Who do unpredictable things to find bugs. A tester's objective is to try as hard as they can to break whatever it is you're trying to release. If they can't, and it goes live, and it turns out it was actually broken, that's not a product of bad development, but actually a product of bad testing.

Burst supports (kill lanes and hard cc / tanky supports in general) > Sustain supports (Heals and keeping them in lane as long as possible) > Poke Supports (Lulu is a great example of a poke support) > burst supports.  I don't know how much of this paragraph is Riot's opinion and how much of it is mine, but it comes from a little bit of discerning how gameplay works.\n\nSona is somewhere between a poke support and a sustain support, but I feel she's more of a sustain support after the rework.  As I said, bursty supports counter sustain supports.  What is the current FotM / Meta for supports?  Thresh.  Morgana.  Braum.  Nami.  All 4 of these champions are burst supports (perhaps a little less so with Nami).  They would have to make Sona Game-breakingly broken to outplay the meta; that is the statement I read from Fearless's post somewhere.","replies":[{"poster":"Neo Cyrus","date":"2014-08-03T01:47:58.717+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":4,"body":"You have absolutely no idea what you're talking about. Do you even think about what you write? You called Thresh, Morgana, Braum and Nami \"burst supports\". Do I even need to explain to you that makes absolutely no sense? No, I'm not being dragged into this conversation.\n\nThis new Sona is outdone by every other support in the game at any MMR beyond Silver and it has absolutely nothing to do with the meta. It's her kit being an absolute joke and a troll job. It feels like Fearless did everything he could to piss off everyone who ever regularly played Sona. So the sheep who parrot out BS like \"can't buff her for this meta or she'll be OP\" can shut up.\n\nAnd people pretend there isn't knowledge difference between ranks. What a joke. It's no surprise they decided to release no numbers at all to try and cover up how badly they destroyed Sona.\n\nI'd bet anything now they'll just leave it to hang and be a miserable failure until everything else in this game is nerfed into oblivion 5 times over until she becomes a viable pick beyond trash Elo. That's precisely what happened to Karma. Reworked and left far too weak, insanely undertuned (realistically could have been allowed to have 2 stacks of Mantra), then became a semi-viable niche pick after a long period of time when everything else was nerfed. Naturally all the sheep toolboxes came out and proclaimed that they were right all along and that the rework was fine.\n\nA rework is not fine if everything else in the game has to be nerfed repeatedly and therefore requires waiting months or years.","replies":[{"poster":"Ulanopo","date":"2014-08-03T02:14:53.776+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"According to League, I'm stuck in that game, else I would be going for round three.\n\nIt is worth noting that Willahelm said something that resonated with me. Sona isn't a poke champion any more and I should stop trying to play her as such. Instead, I should take W first and stand behind my ADC, waiting for something to happen. Sona's new lane role is to punish people who hard initiate on you. I should have seen the implications of the kit sooner.","replies":[{"poster":"Neo Cyrus","date":"2014-08-03T02:26:49.772+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you don't poke you offer almost no presence in lane as Sona, don't listen to him, there's a good reason why after hundreds of games he's still borderline Bronze.\n\nThat's precisely one of the major problems with the new Sona, her laning is now super weak early game, and weak in general. Too weak to poke and lacking the sustain to recover from an exchange which will never go in her favour.\n\nThere's a good reason why she wasn't an LCS pick before (and most certainly will never be one now).

If you just sit back you're doing close to nothing for your ADC and if anything will just cause you to lose faster. If you did that against me and my duo your ADC would be zoned out of minion range immediately. You have to attempt to make trades and as nerfed Sona is it'll only work if you outplay them and take nothing back (and that's technically not even a trade anymore).\n\nSee why people are saying not to pick this new Sona? What's the point of a champion if the only way to win is to outplay the hell out of your opponent in order for it to work in lane. You could save yourself that pain and just play something else.\n\nDon't get me wrong though, I'm not saying she's not viable at all. She most definitely is and can very easily work in low Elo and maybe even mid Elo. I'm saying the old Sona was far superior, far easier to use, and had a distinct role while being fun. This new one is literally infuriating to play as. That and they essentially deleted a character without a good reason to do so. Just because it looks the same and has the same name doesn't make it the same character.","replies":[]},{"poster":"EnvyDragon","date":"2014-08-03T02:52:35.142+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":12,"body":"> >That's precisely one of the major problems with the new Sona, her laning is now super weak early game, and weak in general.

I don't think you know what a strawman argument is.\n\n2) I played ONE bot game as Sona after getting demolished in ranked by a Sona who could chunk half my health with one autoattack at level 1. Just to see if I was seeing things right.\n\n3) What the hell kind of free time do you have where you can look up someone's profile, match history, and MMR (I get matched with high silver/low gold, for the record, despite being unranked this season) just so you can tell them they're wrong?\n\n4) Sheen is a 1200 gold item. Situation permitting, it's possible (unlikely, but possible) to grab it on your first back, even with support income. But you're right, maybe I should have just gone with starting items and stats.\n\nBasic, level 1 Sona with no runes and masteries, and only the 5AP from Spellthief's Edge:\n50 damage from regular AD at level 1\n40 (+2 from AP) damage on the Q bolt, because if you're in range to autoattack, the Q activation will hit the champion\n13(+1 from AP)(x1.5 from Q effect) damage from Power Chord\n20(+1 from AP) damage from Q's aura effect\n30 damage from Spellthief's Edge proccing 3 times, once from the Q bolt and twice from autoattack+passive effect (yes, it procs twice. I just checked it in that bot game to be sure.)\n\n50+42+21+21+30 = 164 damage before reductions from ONE autoattack at level one. Without counting runes and masteries.\n\nGranted, this requires you to prepare Power Chord before you hit lane (which is easy) and it also requires you to have 3 full Spellthief stacks armed. But for a level 1 engage, that's roughly a quarter to a third of a target's health.","replies":[{"poster":"Pika310","date":"2014-08-03T06:27:40.605+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Congratulations, you can do math.

If the ranking system is indeed un-flawed, maybe you can help me succeed at getting better by helping me see the way, oh wise one(s).\n\n2.  The rework.  Sona's job is NOT early game power anymore; it's late-game power. The more champions she tags, the better her abilites are.  She promotes grouping together, which is the counter to the current pro play meta of elise, thresh, morgana, gragas; lots of champions great at forcing champions away from each-other (morgana ult, gragas ult, thresh's ult can zone out a team very well) and hard-ccing one primary target to kill them off and force a 4v5 (elise, thresh, and morg all have single-target hard cc.  That isn't just hard, it's borderline excessive.)  Sona's weaknesses, which are extremely exploitable, are her reliance on snuggle-zones (making AoE CC that much easier to land) and her lack of early-game prowess.\n\n3.  \"Burst\" supports rely on their ability to kill you before you can react.  Morgana, thresh, nami, and braum all excel at this due to their high amount of hard cc.  A lot of other \"burst\" supports have fallen out of the meta due to the change in supports' gold mechanics and their reliance on gold.  Anivia, Gangplank, and Xin Zhao are 3 great examples of champions that I have seen played as support extremely well but have recently fallen off due to the new gold items.\n\n4.  Karma.
