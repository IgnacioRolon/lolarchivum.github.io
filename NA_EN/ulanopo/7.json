My lane partner was distracted and took the wrong summoner spells, for example. We also had some lag issues that led to us getting a Loss Prevented. One of the players was also a little toxic. I queued with Morgana and Kog'Maw.\n\nWhile we definitely turned it around, the only way we could win was by going after the Vayne first, which was a direct consequence of our terrible laning phase. I found myself asking why I don't just switch to Nami. I own her and all her skins.

They don't care about our feelings. They don't care about our ideas or our feedback. They don't care that they've mistreated their core community. They don't care that Sona usage will probably drop after this.

You don't need to convince me of that.\n\nI guess that at this point I'm looking for three things:\n\n1. An explanation for the nerfs to Sona's laning and early game poke. The passive on her ultimate says *very clearly* to me that her early game was a serious concern. In my hands, she went from being a dynamic champ that can wear down the enemy support so that they have to seriously consider the wisdom of going all-in to a passive aura bot. \n\n3. An explanation for why Sona's ult \"costs\" so much on her kit when other champions have similar ults and far more aggressive kits, especially Nami. If you watch the video attached to my OP, you'll see that the Nami was more effective *at the things that I used to bring Sona for*. It feels as though Fearless was aiming to make Sona the first \"hyper-support.\"\n\n5. An admission that it is not okay to be routinely dismissive of our opinions. It would have been one thing if Fearless had said, \"Sona players are going to have to get used to a different laning phase because I moved most of her power into team fights so that she could have spotlight moments other than her ult\" I would have disagreed with the design philosophy, but it would have been a productive discussion. Instead, most of his responses feel like I'm being told that I don't have enough experience to understand the awesome glory of his creation, which could not be farther from the truth.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Sotere","date":"2014-08-04T00:34:25.346+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"I'm only one person, too!  I'm happy to address your points but do take note that my opinion isn't necessarily shared by Fearless, or the Champion Update team.  I was just a player who shared feedback throughout the update process. \n\n1)  Balancing her early game was a concern. I can't speak to the stats on the ultimate. Throughout her update a number of her iterations simply provided more burst and poke on her kit.  When you give her access to that, she single-handedly dominates lanes.  \n\nWe also noticed in testing that she and her laning partner were less susceptible to early all-ins thanks to the shield on Aria of Perseverance.  Since the response to her poking nature was less successful, we had to make sure her poke wasn't overbearing when she was the sole contributor to aggression in a lane.\n\n2) It's just stronger, in my opinion.  Ahskance went into it below , but a nigh instant 1.5 second AOE Stun is huge.  People joke a bit about Flash+Crescendo but the reason the combination is so prevalent is because it's so impactful.     People do not have time to respond to it as they would many other ultimates, so its consistency makes it a strong choice for AOE and pick comps.\n\n3) It's hard to communicate on forums.  A lot of context is not readily apparent in each response.  I can't admit/apologize for Fearless, even if I wanted to. I do know that being dismissive is the furthest thing from his mind.  \n\nHowever, the context that might be missing is that we don't expect updated Sona to be the best champion the first time you play her.  She has her own learning curve. This includes optimizing her build, learning her new positioning, and even includes your allies respecting your new auras.  Part of the beauty of League is that every time you play a champ you like, you get better at them.  \n\nThe other bit of context is that we don't expect to be spot on with our changes. I have provided a ton of feedback through internal tests, yet, I only played her in 10-20 games. The amount of experience I have with her will be dwarfed by people who latch onto her playstyle over this weekend. The amount of games on Sona worldwide over the coming weeks will be gargantuan and from all of that combined feedback we will evaluate where she sits.  \n\nHope that somewhat helps explain where I'm coming from.","replies":[{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2014-08-04T01:07:56.464+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"1. I get that, but I'm just not seeing it. Her W is good for sustain, but it's not great in a burst situation, which is what most of bot lane is nowadays. I get that you don't balance to the meta, but I can't just ask the opposing team 'hey, can you pick off the meta so I can figure out how Sona does against sustain lanes?' So I don't know how Sona does against any lane other than the hyper aggressive level 2 all ins.\n\n2. Her ult is great, but there are other champs that have great teamfight ults too, and their normal abilities aren't weakened for it. While Nami's ult is weaker than Sona ult, I genuinely believe that Nami's entire kit is straight up better than Sona's entire kit.\n\n3. While I see your point, as it'd take a while to get used to any major changes to a champ, even one you play a lot, I have to ask the question: If my previous experience on Sona, having played her frequently since I joined, is mostly inapplicable to the current Sona, is she still the same champ? If not, why should I keep playing her? True, it's not nearly as dramatic a change as the Karma one, who's basically a new champ with a few similar abilities, but I'm having more success playing her as a 'sit back, heal, and disengage' support as compared to the poking, 'war of attrition' style that I was used too. If I wanted to play that sort of champ, I have Janna and Soraka. I simply prefer the way old Sona played as compared to the current one.","replies":[]},{"poster":"XXnIE66Rui","date":"2014-08-04T05:05:05.943+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd just like to point out that Annie's ult can also deliver an instant AoE stun with the added effect of really massive damage depending on how she's built. Not only her ult, either - she has an instant AoE stun available to her in her W with a cooldown only as long as the rotation of her skills to proc her passive again (obviously a much smaller range and overall impact than either ult). I realize they're both very different characters, just pointing out that Annie can essentially do the same thing with her ult for half the mana cost and with a cooldown that's 20 seconds lower. Obviously, Crescendo reaches further, so the two skills aren't 100% comparable, but I still feel like Flash+Tibbers is more powerful considering it costs much less to use.\n\n(A well positioned E from Syndra can do the same, but it's much, much more difficult to pull off properly, so it really only matters competitively or in really high elo, I think.)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ulanopo","date":"2014-08-04T00:55:31.502+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":">1) Balancing her early game was a concern.

Basically what I'm seeing is an enlarged version of the problems with Thresh's lantern. It's very difficult to balance abilities that are used on one or two people at some points and the whole team at others. You have to make the decision regarding which time frame is going to feel underwhelming.\n\nHonestly, large portions of the rework feel like they were designed around the \"nightmare scenario\"\n\n* Her rank 1 Q or W can't be too strong or she'll distort the meta with level 1 invades.\n* Her shield has to be tightly controlled or else Ardent Censer will be too good.\n* Her laning poke has to be weaker because she adds so much damage to team fights.\n\nI was talking about Sona with a friend and we ended up discussing how you can sometimes become wedded to an idea that's creative or innovative, but dangerously strong. You want to keep the idea, but you have to keep nerfing it so it doesn't spoil the game. The difficult thing is knowing when to stop and simply give up on the idea. I'm not saying that anything on the new kit needs to be scrapped, but that is the lens through which I am considering it.","replies":[{"poster":"Pika310","date":"2014-08-04T01:23:14.127+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, but while being cautious and erring on the side of safety is good, you can't pussy-foot to the point that your fear of a new Braum/Thresh completely cripples and hampers your project in its entirety.

They want both definable strengths and definable weaknesses.  After having played her new style kit, she actually reminds me quite a bit of Karma (new style), in the constant AoE capabilities that she brings.  Previous Sona did have stronger \"fire and forget\" poke, and new has less \"fire and forget\" with some forced interaction to keep the damage equal.  Case in point, Karma inhabits the \"long range poke and long range utility\", whereas Sona inhabits the \"shorter range poke and utility\".  I understand the difference is not appreciated to some, but it's enforcing variety in a game where sameness can kill.\n\nOn a personal note, I have been able to successfully play her with the heavy harass style of old.  The numbers have changed, but the playstyle is still available.\n\nAs for the ult \"scaling\" her other abilities, it's to incentivize people getting E prior to level 13.  The base numbers are strong enough to be workable/strong at the relevant levels, but the upwards scaling with ult ranks always you to neglect a skill yet still have it get more before you can properly attend to it with points.  I, personally, feel it's elegantly done and feels very nice.  To a degree, they could remove any of the extra shield/speed/damage and I would still be more than able to make Sona work very well.  Perhaps if they nerf her, that's a good place to examine.\n\n2) As for the 100/150/200 mana cost of the ult, I question that decision as well.  They've been normalizing at 100 for ult ranks for a while now, and I don't see an overarching reason why hers is different.\n\nI'm assuming you're talking about the \"one of the big reason people bring Sona to a game, is the power of her ult\", and why you might feel the rest of her is tuned low to \"balance that power\".  First thing's first, Sona's ult is different from Nami's ult.  Nami's has quite a bit of range, but aside the small annoyance of the knockup, you only really inflict a slow...  Also, the ult is quite avoidable range/kit depending.  \n\nThe different between a slow and a stun... is seeing a LeBlanc distortion in and catching her before she can pop back away from your team to safety.  The life saving halt to a Fizz that just dropped from his pole onto your AD carry before he gets his full rotation off.  The immediate shut down of a surprise lane gank that was stupidly grouped against a Sona.\n\nYou might argue that Nami brings her bubble stun, and it isn't an ult.  You'd be right.  However, it's smaller and considered hard to land.  Arguments vary.  Nonetheless, Sona can damage reduce a diver or team of divers and stop them dead.  Nami can briefly buffet that, and slow them... and depending on player awareness/skill, stun them after.\n\n3) I've read several of your back and forth discussions with Fearless, and he repeatedly apologizes for what he thinks was a lack of interaction of his part.  I've read him apologizing enough times now that I genuinely feel concerned that he may take this whole situation as a strong negative experience and back away from what he does.  I think the end result is quite a bit more fleshed out and realized than prior Sona (and I recognize our differences of opinion), so for my part... I hope he keeps with it.\n\nPlease recognize that Fearless is just a dude going to work and doing a job.  If he were a talented chef hired by Burger King to figure out a different way to cook the Whopper, he may well catch hell from thousands or millions of hamburger eaters country-wide.  Still though, he's just a guy going in to work.  He works on a game for a living.  You don't know if he's a hugely outgoing person in his social life.  He might be great at bouncing ideas off people, but be very focused and run solo when doing the hard numbers.  He says he read though the hundreds of pages of Sona comments, critiques, ideas, and feedback?  I believe him.  I also believe that's he's just a normal dude, going to work...","replies":[{"poster":"Ulanopo","date":"2014-08-04T00:14:58.809+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":">3) I've read several of your back and forth discussions with Fearless, and he repeatedly apologizes for what he thinks was a lack of interaction of his part.\n\nYou're misunderstanding me. He already admitted that he probably made a mistake prioritizing \"bug fixes\" so much over sharing his vision with the community. I'm glad he gets it. It's a really good sign in a dev.\n\nMy specific gripe is how often \"you haven't given it a chance\" or \"that's too small a sample size\" is used as a reason to discount someone's argument. If the chef at my favorite sushi restaurant retires, I shouldn't be told to keep trying the new dishes before voicing my opinion.\n\nNow, I will admit that it wasn't until last night that I fully grokked some of the ramifications of the rework.

It's more than twice as long, is wider, has a better AP ratio and the knockup is obviously not affected by tenacity. They both have tradeoffs, making them *roughly* equal. I don't agree with your devaluing of the knockup, but YMMV. It's also worth noting that the ult triggers Nami's passive on all her allies in the wave, making it easier to get on target.\n\nMaybe I'm being unclear with my argument.\n\n* We want Sona to have nice things.\n* It's difficult to give Sona nice things because of her ult.\n* Rather than biting the bullet and nerfing the ult, we decided to nerf her laning phase.\n\nI would argue that engineering high and low points with regard to choices, time and place is a much better idea than doing so with regard to time frames within the match. This returns to the notion of Sona as becoming more Vayne-like.

Obviously the area of effect of the bubble is smaller than Crescendo, but you can set your team up to pick off a target (or more, if the bubble hits multiple people) by combining the two. Even if you miss the knockup window, the slow can still help.

She and new Karma (I have only played Karma since the rework and I like her a lot), were the only poke supports that actually supported and, of them, Sona is the only one with sustain. There was a lot of encroachment by high-CC Mages like Zyra and Annie, but those are one-trick ponies. I liked the fact that Sona was more forgiving across a wider range of opponents, at least for me. \n\nAs far as playstyle goes, I always felt that Karma was about *targeting* and Sona was about *positioning*. When I pilot her, Karma is a lot more safe, but she feels like she has fewer high points.

Other than some random asshole who mained Sona losing a single game?\n\nConsidering her old playstyle was \"Sitting there and being a placebo\" and her new playstyle actually has some degree of counterplay other than \"remember Sona exists,\" you'll have to pardon me if I interpret all of this tantrum throwing as just that: Whiny children throwing a tantrum. Because that's all it is. New Sona is significantly more potent. Better heals, new teamwide shields, more teamwide damage (110 (+20% AP) on a single hit is far more useful than 20 AD given Sona's short cooldowns), she's more interesting for everyone involved, and the few old strengths she actually had (Strong harassment with Q and passive, strong AoE disruption with Ult, teamwide utility, etc.) *all still exist and have been notably amplified in some instances.*","replies":[{"poster":"FaerKhan","date":"2014-08-04T02:24:56.308+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You display your own ignorance by saying her old playstyle was sitting in a bush being a placebo. Old Sona could control a lane with consistent powerful poke, and provided a lot of utility to her adc and team. New Sona is objectively weaker than old Sona based on pure statistics in reasonable use cases, and requires her teammates to play perfectly to even come close to old Sona. \n\nOh, and you say her cooldowns are short which makes her nerfed Q more useful.... Really? Her cooldowns just got TRIPLED! Tell me more about how a 110 damage hit is super valuable to a class that relies on sustained damage (Adcs). Her heal has conflicting use cases, so you can never use it optimally. There is no way that the Q aura proc out damages the old Q aura over the period of the cooldown when you consider multiple auto attacks and spells used in that time frame (Which will almost always happen over the course of a teamfight). Sorry, you're not going to convince anyone who has actually played Sona that this is a buff, because it's not. \n\nShe's not more interesting, and I don't see how you can make that claim. She's not even more interactive than she was before. Now the only way she can safely do anything is to stand on top of her ADC the whole game, which is entirely boring.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"FaerKhan","date":"2014-08-03T18:44:33.093+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ironically, the reason why they wanted to change Sona is so that she could be less of an aura bot (read team oriented support) and be her own champion that could feel impactful. \n\nSo of course they would rape all of her usefulness and maker her into a mushroom attached to her ADC providing them with all the buffs and not being able to do anything for herself. \n\nMakes perfect sense. \n\nMeanwhile Karma was reworked for being awesome by herself and not \"team oriented\" enough.... Riot's full of crap and they know it. It makes me angry that they're doing this to a popular champion like Sona.
