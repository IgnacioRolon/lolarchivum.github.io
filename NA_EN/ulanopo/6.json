{"poster":"Ulanopo","date":"2014-07-31T04:39:11.285+0000","title":"An Open Letter to Fearless Regarding the Sona Changes","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":49,"down_votes":7,"body":"Dear Fearless,\n\nYou may recall that I was one of the first people to reply to the announcement that Sona was going to be reworked. I made one of the [first comments](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/champions-skins/hUj8b74R-sona-update-qa?comment=0020) to that discussion and it remains the most upvoted entry. I consider myself a support main, with a specialization in Sona. I applied to the PBE, but did not receive an invite. I have played two Co-Op vs. AI matches with her on live. While that may not sound like much, it's enough to get a feel for the reality of the rework.\n\nPut bluntly, I think you failed to provide a viable product and your communication with the community has been ineffective. This isn't personal. I don't know you nearly well enough for it to be personal. So, if you perceive any of this as an attack, please remember that it is not intended as such.\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\n**A Rework Needs to Address a Champion's Place in the Game**\n\nSona was not in a good place before the rework. Her pick/ban rates were low and she was routinely outclassed by more modern supports. Part of this is simply the march of new technology and part of this is Riot's desire to move toward flashy, high-risk plays. Sona was also a prime target for a rework because her auras were bad for the game. They *had to go*.\n\nWhile this rework made her kit less toxic, it did nothing to address her position in the meta. There is nothing on this frame that I can point to and say, \"This is a good reason to pick Sona.\" Keep in mind that one of the chief complaints about her kit was that she felt like an \"ult delivery system,\" so that can't be her role now. Her ult is comparable to those of Amumu and Zyra, but people pick them for reasons other than the ult. I feel that you were hyperf-focused on getting rid of the auras and forgot to define what Sona *does*.  Now, to be fair, she had this problem before they handed her to you, but developing a role for her should have been the first step in the process.\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\n**This Rework Damages Important Ratios**\n\nIn game design, there are two important ratios: Risk vs. Reward and Reward for Effort. Both of those ratios went in the wrong direction.\n\n*Risk vs. Reward*: Sona now has to be significantly closer to the front line, but she does not gain any benefit from this increased risk, nor were any of her stats changed to reflect this increased risk. She went from being a champion who sat at mid to long range, dipping in to poke, to a champion that has to \"snuggle\" down in the scrum to be effective. If you look over the complaints following the live release, this is among the most common.\n\nIt's worth noting that the enemy bruisers and assassins are going to be *itching* to have a squishy target to jump on. I saw this several times in my matches. I went forward to shield someone and was killed in an eye blink. That felt incredibly punishing. \n\nAnother component of this ratio is that I am now forced to stack up with my allies, making me (and my allies) more vulnerable to AoE comps. The reward for tagging should *at least* be equal to the increased damage I take while stacked, but I don't feel that it is. \n\nThere were several times in my matches where I couldn't get to my allies and this felt awful. This was especially bad in the early laning phase.\n\nChanging the risk vs. reward ratio is also very dangerous because it causes a massive change in feel. I already own risky supports. People who liked Sona now have to adapt to a much riskier position or give up on the champion. Given that she is mostly a fan pick as it is, this is really bad.\n\n*Reward for Effort*: The harder you have to work for something, the more you expect out of it. People learn this as children. From a play balance perspective, this means that complex mechanics and kits should provide more options, rather than increased power. League does a decent job of this, except when it comes to modal champions like Elise and Jayce.\n\nThis rework represents a *massive* increase in the amount of effort required to use her abilities \"properly.\" I say this because it feels as though she was balanced around getting most, if not all, of her allies in her \"snuggle zones.\" When I play her, I do not feel like I am rewarded for tagging people; I feel like this is the baseline and I am being punished when I can't get to my teammates. This is especially bad because Sona is touted as an easy, \"entry-level\" support.\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\n**Her New Mechanics Chew Up Mental Bandwidth**\n\nWhen I use her Q, I lose effectiveness unless *both* I and my ADC gain the benefit of the secondary effect. This means that I have to slide forward, use Q, autoattack, then move to tag my teammate. This is not a simple maneuver for a routine activity. The same goes for her W.\n\nWorse, this is a terrible use of bandwidth. Every time I use my abilities I have to track not only the position of my enemies, but those of my allies. We're not talking about a generalized sense, either. I have to track their position, likely movement and how I'm going to get to them to a precise degree. This is because the tiny \"snuggle zones\" require me to manage my positioning in a way that no one else is tasked with. You said that you wanted it to be a non-trivial exercise to apply the buffs, but I feel that you swung too far in the opposite direction.\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\n**I Hate Her New E With Every Fiber of my Being**\n\nA short list:\n\n* I have to have the same tier of boots as my allies or I can't apply the buff. I'm on a support salary.\n* Applying the buff requires people to move in a way that is unnatural. No one clusters like that.\n* I feel like I am being forced to choose between leveling things that I enjoy (Q and W) and the thing that I need to tag people because my effectiveness is now suddenly based on my speed. I feel that this diffuses my impact on fights.\n* I feel that it's insufficient to get me out of a bad situation... *ever*. There are too many dashes and whatnot compared to the long cooldown.\n* I do not feel like I can use it to get my allies onto a fleeing target that they wouldn't have caught without me.\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\n**Her \"Snuggle Zones\" are Incompatible with Her Passive**\n\nWhen I use an ability, the first thing I want to do is move so that I'm tagging the people who weren't already in the zone because otherwise I feel like I am not getting enough out of the ability. This means that I have to choose between optimizing the buff and, you know, fighting. This is a really frustrating decision gate. It adds complexity for no reason.\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\n**Her New Mechanics Suck in Running Fights**\n\nThis is an area where I feel especially forced to level E and buy speed boots, because my closure rates with my allies is not fast enough otherwise. This feels like a direct nerf to my viability in skirmishes. Heaven help me if my allies have some sort of engage or dash mechanic, because there's no chance of getting the buff on them then.\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\n**Her W is Really Clunky**\n\nThe mechanic for applying the shield is highly counterintuitive. The shield is really short, so I either have to be right on top of the target (not gonna happen in most circumstances) or I have to move to tag them. This makes is very difficult to use the shield to prevent damage, especially in skirmish and siege situations. The only time it felt effective was during pile-on teamfights. Given the method of application, I don't understand why it couldn't last longer.\n\nYou commented in[ this post](http://boards.pbe.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/champions-gameplay-feedback/smgY9223-why-even-bother-with-sonas-shield?comment=00080000000000020000) about how people perceive the shield portion of the ability. Put bluntly, I don't think that \"I'm adding a weak shield to make up for a nerfed heal\" is good design theory. People want their powers to have an impact on the game.\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\n**Too Much of Her Power is On Other People**\n\nI feel like her power was balanced around her buffing her allies, so being alone is *much* worse than it was before. I did not feel like I had any impact or survivability in *any* 1v1. This was compounded by the fact that my E was never a viable escape maneuver. \n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\n**Our Feedback was not Handled Appropriately**\n\nGoing back over your posts, I feel that the vast majority can be distilled down to \"Wait until you play it\" or \"Our internal tests say you're wrong.\" Given that the PBE is an invite-only environment, the first comment is completely unacceptable, especially since it appears that invites were set *prior* to the announcement of the rework. I know at least forty people who applied, most of them immediately after the announcement. Not a single one of them got in.\n\nThis is especially upsetting because we were told that Sona was going to be on the PBE for longer than other champions because you \"wanted to get it right.\" Not only was this not true, but the only change that was made was the increase to to her \"snuggle zones.\" It did not feel like you listened to the community at all.\n\nAlso, if internal testing is going to be an absolute trump to our suggestions, why bother to solicit feedback at all? It was highly irritating to be told over and over what amounted to \"You guys just don't get it.\"  It was disrespectful and unprofessional. \n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\n**Say Nice Things About Detroit**\n\nI know that I have been really negative here and that some of it might come across as an attack, but there were some positive aspects to the rework.\n\n* Getting rid of the auras was a good thing.\n* The Heal on her W felt much better than I expected.\n* I like the increased visibility of my abilities. It felt like my team could \"see me\" more.\n* I was wrong about the increase in cooldowns. I feel like my abilities are up when I want them (except W).\n* I feel that you did a good job of giving me high points other than my ult.\n* I was also wrong about my ADC using my Q buff. They recognized what it was and used it appropriately.","replies":[{"poster":"Neo Cyrus","date":"2014-08-01T14:17:40.107+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":1,"body":"So basically he came in and said \"No because I say so\" to every point made and threw out straw man arguments that no one is stupid enough to believe. Go figure.\n\nWhat was the point of this? The champion is less viable, less fun, clunky as hell and nothing positive was gained. The only thing that occurred is that it's ensured to never be played in the LCS/OGN and that those who enjoy the character are going to be forced to quit it or just lose a lot more often. There's been a 4% drop in Sona's win rate EVERY DAY at high Elo since these nerfs.\n\nThe win rate is not going up as time passes, it's going down. It's not a mechanically intensive champion (now just clunky), there are no changes in build style, nothing new really as far as her skills go to adapt to, nothing to adjust to at all. There is no adjustment period, this is it, she's far less viable than the old Sona and far less enjoyable.\n\nGood job guy who ignores everyone's opinions, you've ruined yet another unique champion and won't even admit your screw-up. Oh and I almost forgot, stop nerfing Sona's breasts as well. As if nerfing her kit to death wasn't enough.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DreamingOf Peace","date":"2014-08-01T00:31:07.494+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"As hostile as I am to these changes I will also agree that I think your thought process behind this rework was good. Turning the auras into zones was a good idea but then you should have buffed Sona's armor and health if you want her to be in the front line especially since Sona is forced to build CDR/AP now instead of tanky if you want these auras to be impactful.  T**he reason her base stats are so low was because one upon a time her W used to give 20 armor and 20 mres and then the heal added another 20/20** even more, additionally **Aegis and Runic bulwark **added even more and she always took those. So now that the game has changed so much since then, including Sona herself and those items, why are Sona's base armor and health so low? Why did you further reduce her base health while at the same time slightly buffing her base armor? I am completely baffled and confused. There is a lack of consistency here.\n\n If you don't want her to be in the front line then you should have the radius of her zones scale larger into late game.

When we evaluate a champion and make changes, we do spend a great deal of time making sure they have a place in the game as a whole. We constantly evaluate their strengths and weaknesses, their interactions with champs, items, etc. However, we don't (and I'd argue really shouldn't) try to make a champ fit the current meta. Meta, by definition will always favor some champs over others. Making Sona viable for the current meta is very likely to damage her position in the game. Basically, if the meta favors most of the champs that do well against Sona, and we make Sona strong in that environment, she has to be completely brokenly OP. If the meta capitalizes on Sona's weaknesses, and we make her strong despite that we end up having to give her no meaningful weakness.  \n\nGoing to reply in blocks due to the length of this.

This means that she is more tanky for every common teamfight situation outside of level 1 fights. In level one fights, the power given from either a team wide Q proc or a full team shield is flat out bonkers. \n\n>It's worth noting that the enemy bruisers and assassins are going to be itching to have a squishy target to jump on.

An assassin that tries to brute force a kill on Sona will easily pay for it due to W PC, exhaust, ult and the increased shield + heal when used well. I'm not saying she might not die, but I think Sona has the tools to make sure her team comes out on top for it. \n\n>Another component of this ratio is that I am now forced to stack up with my allies, making me (and my allies) more vulnerable to AoE comps.

I already own risky supports. People who liked Sona now have to adapt to a much riskier position or give up on the champion.

There are regions where she is very high in play rate. That being said, there is an adjustment cost for any update, and for Sona, one of the new elements is being in a place where you interact with your team more visibly and directly. That does increase risk, but mostly because old Sona had little incentive to work among her team outside of landing her ult. \n\n>This rework represents a massive increase in the amount of effort required to use her abilities \"properly.\" I say this because it feels as though she was balanced around getting most, if not all, of her allies in her \"snuggle zones.\" When I play her, I do not feel like I am rewarded for tagging people; I feel like this is the baseline and I am being punished when I can't get to my teammates.

It's the \"use this to improve your team's offense\" ability. Why is it that the only allies who benefit are autoattackers?

You act like it's a giant traveling knockup, something that can't be countered (face the wind, says Yasuo / Braum), or that she's game breaking. Nobody says her ult is the best in the game anymore, are you living in season 2? \n\nYou pretend to think she can burst people with it now and it's a spell that's used every 10-15 seconds (hello Nami Q). Try building her AP without any defenses, you'll die before you can even hit R. Don't believe me? Go play against a smart Rengar / assassin who catches you out while you ward river. They will enjoy your tears and screams for mercy. Hell, they don't even have to be an assassin. Any form of damage will do. Oh is that a Lux laser I see? It's ok I'm on full health... \"You have been slain\". \n\n> * She has great poke and sustain. \n\nPoke? She will die (via CC enemy reaction) in lane instantly if she even ATTEMPTS this. You act like her Q targeting is reliable and doesn't already put her in a risky situation. If anything blocks your pathing, you just wasted the trade.\n\nSustain? Why sustain with a single spell when you can poke AND sustain spam Nami's W all day.\n\n> * She gives her allies tremendous amounts of power in a team fight.\n> \n> *Edit to fix formatting.*\n\nYou're joking right? With the duration of these \"buffs\" being so LITTLE TIME to react and hardly visible to your team mates, good luck making use of that buff.\n\nLet's not forget the shit range. Too busy telling my team mates \"STOP OUT RUNNING MY AURA\" to even give it to them. Also, you can forget about giving it to anything but the ADC, you'll never be safe if you're trying to tag the melee front line.\n\nBtw, thanks for the shield buffs.

I generally go for Sheen first if I can afford it (better early trading), then Sightstone, then on with the build path as usual.\n\nI also bring 10% CDR via masteries, plus 20% from Talisman (I always pick it over the FQC line in the end because of the CDR+extra speed steroid+mana regen) means I'll go for a 10% CDR item after Talisman (Twin Shadows, Athene's, Locket etc).

Her sustain is fine, but it's going to drain her mana, and as a support, she can't really afford to get mana regen items early.

I mean, as a longtime Sona player, I'm baffled as to why Riot decided that she should be squishier at level 1-3 and why they decreased her range and took away the resistances from her W without giving her some more significant durability buffs, but I'm not going to comment on that, as I haven't played the new version of Sona yet and Fearless is already working to address issues and argue his views.  I'm not going to add to his workload.\n\nMy first gripe is the way you guys announced the rework being live.  I've always hated the Knowledge base vague descriptions of abilities and the fact that this was pretty much all we got from the update news meant that I had to go to a third party site to get ANY solid numbers on this rework.  Considering Riot's normal stance on being transparent and clear, this felt obscuring, as if this were a big nerf and y'all were trying to cover up the fact.  An immediate (you guys have gotten pretty lazy with this) knowledge base update or laying out numbers CLEARLY in the patch notes could have easily fixed this issue.  So why force people to leave your wonderful resources when you could put half the effort you put into making the Sona rework page porting the info to the current knowledge base or putting the numbers there for us geeks who want to read them and compare?\n\nMy second complaint is the speed at which Sona was rushed to live.  She was in at least a decent spot, wasn't causing major gameplay issues, and had a pretty touchy gameplay rework which changed quite a bit.  I'm quite familiar with project fatigue and the need to get something done quickly, but this was something where many members of the community had big issues with how the rework felt and how they felt it affected a character they cared deeply about.  Furthermore, past projects like the Skarner and Xerath reworks took far longer on the PBE to get everything hammered out and (IMO) overall that ensured a better finished product.  There was no rush, so why push the rework through a valuable beta opportunity so quickly?\n\nEdit: It looks like she was actually on the PBE for longer than I thought, likely the lack of communication contributed to my confusion for this and as a non regular forumgoer, I missed the fact that these issues had already been addressed.
