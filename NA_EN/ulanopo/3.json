It&#039;s gotten so bad that Riot is making a [one-time change to how this is handled](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/TGYs0hwO-2018-end-of-season-rewards-and-honor).\n\nI would argue that&#039;s still unfair, especially when you consider that end-of-season and the period between seasons tend to be really chaotic and tense. You&#039;re asking people to be on significantly better than average behavior at the time when it&#039;s most difficult to keep your cool. Add in the stress of this one-time deal and things are going to be rough.\n\nMy solution would be that you earn whatever rewards you&#039;re entitled to at the end of season, but _**you can&#039;t wear any of that flair at ANY TIME you're below Honor 2**_. I feel this would be an excellent incentive for improvement and would feel more even-handed than the current system. In fact, having a ceremony where you regain all that content would probably feel amazing.\n\nEDITED FOR CLARITY: Under my proposal, you would \"lose\" all ranked rewards for all seasons whenever you dipped below Honor 2. You would probably gain a quest to get to Honor 2 and regaining that content would be the reward. This would be a relatively easy thing to add to the client, at least in my opinion.","replies":[{"poster":"The Ecdysiast","date":"2018-11-17T01:37:48.829+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"I said it in another comment, but I think 2 is too low.

They effectively don't have the skin until they reach back up to honor 2.\n\nBut I'd go further with it, and lock it out until you reach honor 4. So they'd still have the skin they rightfully earned by being a cooperative, effective teammate (which actually improves the community), but not get to use it for pretty much the whole season.","replies":[{"poster":"Silly Neeko","date":"2018-11-17T01:50:23.585+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"That would cut off those that do some ranked and get up, which doesnt always take a lot of games... and pretty much make it so that even if they are doing good and being helpful, they still are not able to use it.

Which works on paper but if someone is usually nice and helpful, honor 5 and good and never tilting, they could be in diamond or master or something.... then they argue with someone in game once and BOOM they lose out on everything.

It makes you feel even worse when you get hardly any key fragments on top of all that.\n\nYes, it is supposed to feel like a punishment. However, for a minor thing like chat restrict, should the punishment REALLY be that harsh? Yes, punishment is required, its a show of \"this behavior is not acceptable\".

I feel this is a good approach toward a middle ground, where people who have hit near the top of the \"punishment volcano\" have a significant enough deterrent, but it is not a crippling burden.\n\nWith my addendum above, I feel it also keeps the significant punishment necessary as a deterrent for game play related punishments.\n\nThoughts?","replies":[]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2018-11-17T06:28:01.501+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ulanopo,realm=NA,application-id=6heBIhQc,discussion-id=WdU7vaWI,comment-id=,timestamp=2018-11-17T01:17:53.842+0000)\n>\n> significantly better than average behavior\n\nBehavior that avoids a ban is actually firmly average.
