Truth is I was writing out a farewell post to all of you guys. For some reason I had lost all motivation when it came to writing threads and discussing in them. So I was leaving and doing it with this huge thread detailing my feelings on the positive state of narrative and a big mopey farewell were I listed  and thanked everyone that had made story and art a welcoming place for me and many others. But then as I wrote down the list I realized I could never abandon these people. You guys are like family to me.\r\n\r\nSo **FUCK THAT SHIT**. I&#039;m never leaving motherfuckers so if you guys would be so kind as to get me up to date over what has been going on here over the past two moths it would be greatly appreciated. \r\n\r\nAlso just for kicks I&#039;m posting the list. So in a way this is a thank you but not a farewell.\r\n\r\nNAMELESSHERO\r\nThank you for teaching me to ignore whiners and trolls.\r\n\r\n333LOM\r\nHi there my fellow acolyte.
