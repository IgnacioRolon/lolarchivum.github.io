Thank you.","subforum":"Story, Art, & Sound","up_votes":22,"down_votes":12,"body":"Azir&#039;s full lore is finally in the website, and I must say its amazing. This is only the beginning though. It looks like the full stories narrative had in store for us can finally be published in the Lol website now that the test seems to have  been a success. I, for once, cannot wait to see what narrative has in store for us.\n\nAnyway, I want to take this time to thank Jaredan and the narrative team for not giving up on us. We criticized you on every twist and turn. We dismissed the technical and infrastructural problems you had to face. Many of us even assumed you weren&#039;t working at all and constantly accused you of it. \n\nAll of this created a hate that made many of us instantly jump on you the moment you commented on a story and art post. We threatened you, made you never want to interact with us again, then we wrote about how much we despised you for not talking to us when we were the ones who drove you away. \n\nBut most of all I want to thank all of you old school die-hard lore fans who kept me hopeful during these long months. It was hard, but things are starting to look up for once. I even want to thank Riot\nBioluminescence for sticking with us here in the narrative boards even though he/she isn&#039;t a part of narrative. I knew all our hoping would pay off soon enough. We believe in you narrative, I hope you know that. So keep on giving it your all. Well be here waiting excitedly, we always will. Thanks.\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2015-07-18T21:46:56.956+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for your thanks, Kadavik, though I want to point out that the Azir story *was* released in the past - but only on the forums where it was almost immediately forgotten about or missed.

We're getting there, slowly but surely, and with this (maybe) looking to be the fix for the tech issues (maybe) there's more to look forward to I'd say, but chapter twos? Some champs still need chapter ones yet.","replies":[{"poster":"SpecterVonBaren","date":"2015-07-19T06:12:52.260+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why is Nautilus in there?

That is writing words into a website in one year shouldnt be as glorified as you do.\n\nBecause what i read in your thread just made me laugh.\n\n\nYou are saying that its the communitys fault that Narrative refuses to communicate, when it isnt. They always refused to communicate. How do you think the retcon happened? It wasnt us who pushed them away for no  reason. It was them.\n\nAlso, you are so happy, but as far as i can see there is no reason. Why? Because the only thing Narrative managed to do in 1 year, was writing words in a webste. Which is IT 101.\n\nNo offense, but for me it looks like you are just another Narrative apologetic which has pink glasses on. How can anyone believe in the narrative after all the retcons they made? Who in the right mind can trust these guys?\n\n\nI know i will be downvoted because i am such a mood killer and because i am so salty at the narrative. But you guys shouldnt forget,forgive and especially shouldnt encourage narrative team to continue with what they were doing this past year. Which was nothing. Blind optimism doesnt help, it only makes you have mind with 0 critical thinking.","replies":[]}]}
