It&rsquo;s a terrible idea, I agree. However, what&rsquo;s the harm in us getting short progress reports? I&rsquo;m not asking for us to know what you guys are up to 100% of the time, just a simple status update every now and then. \n\nI think small things like this could really change our little corner of the boards. First of all it would create consistency in our posts. The themes that we discussed in our threads would be the ones we knew Art and Narrative were working on right now! \nHere&rsquo;s an example. Say someone from the narrative team posted &ldquo;Writing Jax&rsquo;s new bio, keep an eye out on his champion page!&rdquo; the prevalent theme in Story and Art for the next few days would certainly be posts discussing Jax&rsquo;s character, visuals and what we want from him in the future. This way you reds could see what we want from Jax when it comes to his identity much more clearly and cohesively than any post about Jax once a month ever could! \n\nThese progress reports could also calm our anxiety when waiting for new lore releases. They&rsquo;d let us know just what&rsquo;s going on. For example: Jaredan, you could post something like &ldquo;editing champion short stories&rdquo; that way we would know what you guys are up to. It would be such a great and unifying experience between us the community and you guys at narrative. Not to mention it would be extremely satisfactory to read that the wait is over a week later or so with something as simple as \"champion short stories finished, hope you enjoy them!\"  This doesn&rsquo;t only need apply when it comes to narrative. Art would definitely benefit a lot from posting these too. It would be pretty fun to see Ironstylus post &ldquo;just finished modeling {{champion:44}} &#039;s new shield, I must admit it&rsquo;s looking FABULOUS&rdquo;. Like I said before this could only improve the Story and Art boards and create a better experience for everyone while maintaining an easy not-much-effort required connection between you guys at Riot HQ and us here at Boards.\n\nFinally, if any of you guys have a better way to implement this idea or achieve this goal please tell me so. See you in the Rift.","replies":[{"poster":"RiotJaredan","date":"2015-08-28T04:16:21.968+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":1,"body":"Other than new Champions (concepts, thematic cohesion, character intros (the new bio format), and introductory promos), champs in the ChampUp pipeline (concepts, character intros and story promo), we're working on new character introductions for Shadow Isles Champions, and some stuff I really can't go into, sorry.\n\nOnce the pipeline on a couple of recently spun up teams that we're a part of are in full working order, we'll be able to pop by more often.\n\nWe've put back some of the additional work that we want to do to finish the Shurima character intros a bit to focus on some stuff that we think will give a bit more enjoyment in the short to medium term.

That kind of thing is still happening.\n\n@Riot, When are you actually going to show your fans that you actually care about Runeterra's Lore?! \n\n**Giving us the a story that feels like a movie screenplay twice a year doesn't cut it!**\n\nWhen will Runeterra be an evolving world again? _(@Riot, check out what Guild Wars 2 is doing with their evolving Story....you may want to take notes.)_\n\n**@Riot, I wish you would embrace your lore rather than retcon it!**\n\n\nI'm still hoping for Riot to deliver, but this lore retcon has already taken way too long.\n\nGranted Riot has produced some pretty great stories recently (Bilgewater), but they've yet to make the retconned Runeterra actually feel like a world.\n\nA few good story events doesn't bridge the gap between what Runeterra used to be with the Institute of War.\n\nThe Retcon has been in progress for about a year.

Keep in mind i'm not asking for lengthy paragraphs. Perhaps progress report isn't the right way to describe it. How about status update? \n\n They would just need to be just a couple of sentences. It would take no more effort than commenting on a post, which Jaredan and the guys from Narrative HAVE done already.
