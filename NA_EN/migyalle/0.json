This sort of environment is EXTREMELY deterring to the new players, and new players will see this game as desolate and boring. \r\nThe main purpose of this is to rise the number of caught bots to make people who are real have real League of Legends experience and not false bot-tower dives, cold interactions with 0 reply, and a overall feeling of nothing accomplished or nothing gained.\r\nThis affect will ultimately lower the amount of players coming to play League of Legends in both the short, and long runs.","replies":[{"poster":"Rebonack","date":"2016-06-09T17:42:13.286+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":0,"body":"We Dominion players protected you all from this.

Any new players that come into the game will run into at least one bot per game and when you are new to the game a fed bot is going to stomp you especially with the way they coordinate their ults. I know that Riot can't say openly \"we are doing X and Y to address this\" but they *need* to say something to address this or it looks like they are doing nothing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zarkkast","date":"2016-06-10T13:32:25.816+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"One of the reasons Riot decided to remove Dominion.\n\nBecause why deal with a problem when we can just pretend it didn't happen?","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Captain Crow","date":"2016-06-10T00:00:30.481+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aye. 'Twas always an issue for this game. Riot's silence on th' matter 'longside with their current reputation as it be only makes it feel worse since ye get that forebodin' sense that th' games own developers give not an ass rat's 'bout what happens to it. 'Ere be so much we don't know what be goin' on internally at Riot's main office that it just be muddled... It honestly gives a vibe that they be at war with 'emselves or are just truly manipulative on 'eir basis. I don't want that to happen but it seems _League of Legends_ be turnin' into _Runescape_ with Riot leadin' its Jagex. Things like what ye show are a strong example of what we be headin' back too in history.\n\nAs a casual player with an incentive to win if it means fun for all, it just hurts with things like 'ese happenin'.\n\nTh' only thing that I can say now to any of us - yet, mainly to ye - be just a frail hope:\n**_\"Eyes up, Guardian.\"_**","replies":[{"poster":"MigYalle","date":"2016-06-10T00:17:12.601+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Funny thing is, I graduated high school this year and one of my raid buddies only wrote one thing on my autographs page. 'Eyes up Guardian.\" - Henry\nI love you guys haha! <3 \nI also agree with you, I used to play Runescape and the bot plague was one of the most annoying things in that game that deterred new players because of a lack of social experience in a game that should have a bare minimum on social experience which is even more profoundly seen at the low levels. I hope Riot could address this issue because it isn't very fair to the people who weren't here in League's prime","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Blue Moon Wolf","date":"2016-06-10T02:50:42.640+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The Co-Op vs Ai players have been seeing this for ages now (almost every other match) and no one cared because \"lol, who cares.
