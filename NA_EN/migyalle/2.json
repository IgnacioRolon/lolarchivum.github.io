If lucario gets to mega evolve, he'd probably take it, but if not, it would be interesting.\n\nRek'Sai definitely as the advantage in Tankiness and brute strength, but Lucario is more agile, and has more overall options, given his even Attack and Sp. Attack.\n\nI think Lucario has the options to outplay the situation, but overall, Rek'Sai is too massive a foe for the 3'11\" Lucario to defeat (or you could be reasonable and assume he's about human height, as pokemon sizes are crap, but point still stands). A monster the size of a house can't viably be taken down by a human sized anything, except maybe a human sized nuke.\n\nEdit: Rek'Sai would also probably have the type advantage. Lucario is Steel/fighting while Rek'Sai is probably Ground/Fighting.

Anivia would attempt to wall Yveltal's lasers, and use Glacial Storms to slowly whittle Yveltal down with icicles.
