What's up with that?\n\nMy network is fine, I can play other games like PUBG, DOTA2 and Offworld trading company just fine. League of legends just keeps bugging apparently.\n\nI've already done :\n-- a speed-test. (it's ok)\n-- repair the client (seems ok)\n-- Performed Hextech Repair Tool, fresh install (finished)\n\nif you have any clues on what's happening, I'm all ears.\n\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-29T20:55:04.813+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmmmm so it's only disconnecting you whenever you hit that save button for your masteries?
