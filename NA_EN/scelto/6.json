It sounds like a friend might have been playing a trick on you by using an emote command in chat to make his message look like a System Message. At this moment, you aren't banned and should be able to continue playing games without anything stopping you!\n\nPSA: If you ever see someone attempting to abuse this feature by impersonating Riot, feel free to take a screenshot and shoot it our way to investigate. Impersonating Riot personnel by sending fake ban messages is not allowed, due to the fact that it can be misleading and well, rude xD.","replies":[{"poster":"Scelto","date":"2017-08-07T02:37:39.251+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"ilu broporo! always when i need help you're there for me <3","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-07T03:20:39.493+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We got you fam!\n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[{"poster":"Scelto","date":"2017-08-07T03:54:15.671+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{sticker:zombie-nunu-hearts}}","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Original Taylor","date":"2017-08-07T02:52:31.249+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"good to know. i got it last weekend and havent signed in since. :3","replies":[]}]}]}
