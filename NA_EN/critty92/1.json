Put them at the lowest of tiers and force them to grind at least 100 games before getting to Gold. This would stop smurf infiltration and make players have to focus more on their actual accounts. The fact you can get a new account then inflated mmr off the bat due to some win streaks breaks the system hard. And makes the game more unfair for everyone else.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Posui Gart","date":"2020-02-04T19:20:02.779+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you are matched with players who are \"overconfident after playing with bots\", thats the problem by itself.","replies":[]},{"poster":"God Hates Teemo","date":"2020-02-04T19:04:34.577+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you need to be level 30 before you can do ranked.\nUnless you are speed leveling an account, you shouldn't be doing bot matches after like level 4 or something (level 10 if you want to wait for flash)","replies":[]},{"poster":"xox BaByDoLL xox","date":"2020-02-04T18:15:12.460+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"More champions, maybe.\nMore levels, maybe.\nM4 on 10 champs?

Just because someone has played a lot doesn't mean they are better at the game, the contrary if you ask me, if you play a lot and still are around new player MMR, it means you belong there.\n\nI think maybe riot should introduce a ranked games defeat cap per day. So, if someone loses let's say 5 ranked games in  a day they have to wait 24 hours to play ranked again. I think this would remove agitated players from the ladder. This is also an opinion and I don't think it makes less sense than yours. Someone that lost 5 games in a day is obviously someone that is not in any state to play more games. For their own good and their teammate's LP.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SweetShiroNeko","date":"2020-02-04T18:12:49.495+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"bots have more level than random gold an platinum players.","replies":[]}]}
