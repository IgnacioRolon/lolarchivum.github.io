Most missions (and especially the most challenging missions) were all just \"clear with X augments\" And to make matters worse you could not do them at the same time. I cleared a run where everybody had 2 augments for the \"clear with 4 augments\" mission, and then i had to do the 3 augments mission. And then once i did that I had to do the 2 augments one. Which i really already completed but didn't count because of the mission order.\nDoing those missions was just a grind of getting people doing the same mission, and surrendering if not. At the end of the day you would spend more time getting in game than playing a game because of it.\nEven if you were finally done with those stupid missions yourself, you can't play the highest difficulty with augments because other random people will just instantly surrender when you don't select 2 augments max.\nAt the end of the day, if you wanted to play with augments you had to play the 2nd highest difficulty, which really wasn't all that difficult.\n\nI personally did not really like Odyssey.

Now that TT has been lost, which was the closest mode there was to offering this, it hurts (the bots just moved to co-op vs. A.I., the OTHER mode that offers this). As a mode, neither NB or URF is really \"better\" than SR... but at the same time, you can jump in queue, pick whoever, and off you go... and that appeals to me these days, all in the time an SR lobby is abandoned because someone dodged halfway through pick.\n\nARAM is still great for what it is, but it differs in that it's a one lane teamfight from the start, and you can't pick your champion.\n\nI remember thinking I'd like the very original URF, only to dislike it after two or three rounds.
