I havnt played her in jng lately, in mid you now have to use more spells to push quickly, but overall, I would say, she feels ok. She is imo kinda sleeper op, like Rumble mid","replies":[{"poster":"letsfeedtogether","date":"2019-05-28T13:06:21.144+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"She is not like asol at all.
