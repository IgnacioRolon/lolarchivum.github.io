I log in the next day to see I have been stripped of my honor, and demoted to Level 1 with no way of receiving honor until X amount of normal games have been played. Devastated because again level 3 just got released....I went through those games in 2 days and was able to start receiving \"honor\" again. I have gotten about 15 key frags and still am stuck at level 1 while i see mulitple lvl 5's every day. I have been playing at level 1 for over a month and have 0 progress....how is this fair? My account has never been banned or reported prior to this and it's been around since season 3. But a random bronze troll can come and ruin an entire honor system....Riot....Please find a heart, a cure, or whatever it takes to fix this. I do like the punishment system for people who repeat offend, but for the one time offenders (d/c, (unintent-feed, w/e) is a little harsh to say the least.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-29T00:19:15.757+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I did go ahead and look over the chat that was reported which ended up getting your honor rank dropped. While it doesn't look like you initiated anything, whoever reported you might have done so only after you started using words like \"retard\". With that being said in team chat, I can only assume it was directed at your own teammates, which isn't exactly the shining example of teamwork.\n\nNo worries about Honor quite yet though. Everyone gains Honor at their own pace and Honor Rank 3 wasn't released for everyone. You're still getting that Honor xp back, and with enough games/honors you'll be at Rank 5.","replies":[{"poster":"Wetcrit","date":"2017-08-29T02:53:53.450+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"True that word should not be used, was a rough day and he iced that cake. Even so still being honor lvl 1 while putting in quite a few games (getting honored each game at least once) is there more to ranking than meets the eye?","replies":[{"poster":"Wetcrit","date":"2017-08-29T02:57:07.542+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sidenote: when going up the ladder does it require more honors for higher the level or is it more a top % thing?

I got to honor level 5 recently and then got a 2 weeks ban for obvious reasons. Not something I'm proud of and anyone looking at the chat log will understand why. Worst part is that I got mad at a guy who flamed the whole team, and that's where I lost it. A mistake were made, but a lesson learned.","replies":[{"poster":"Wetcrit","date":"2017-08-29T20:52:11.899+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel your pain.
