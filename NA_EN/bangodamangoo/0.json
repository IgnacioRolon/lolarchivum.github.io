With all the people that I play with, there is always people that play good or bad. But if someone is obviously trolling, or you have players that are attacking you first with complaints, but when you give feedback, YOU get banned. Its the stupidest thing and sucks that you can't say anything anymore on chat cause you can instantly get banned. This game has gone downhill, and now with the fact that you can't trash talk anymore to your team mates if they're doing bad or obviously trolling, this game has become dead. I know i sound toxic by saying things like that, but since the COD days where you would get into a lobby and trash talk team mates, that's where most of the fun was, but now its a snowflake community and it's sad. I really want to know if the people that trash talk me first or the people that go afk after 4 minutes and ruin the experience of the game get banned. Cause if not, then it really shows how this game went downhill by focusing on the people that talk trash but play than the people that just go afk or int after being told by the whole team that they should stop playing the way they are. If you don't type then your safe is the point i'm trying to make, even if you do all the other MORE toxic things (int, afk, etc.) to make the gaming experience worse.","replies":[{"poster":"GatekeeperTDS","date":"2019-09-25T02:33:56.572+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":2,"body":"> This is unfair\n\nOK, let's see...\n\n>  keep on getting banned for toxicity,\n\n{{sticker:sg-janna}}","replies":[{"poster":"BangoDaMangoo","date":"2019-09-25T02:38:40.312+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":8,"body":"yea the way i worded it is horrible but what i really mean to say is that i understand that what im doing is wrong but i would like to know if people that do even worse than just banter and make the gaming experience by going afk or int get banned as well.","replies":[{"poster":"GatekeeperTDS","date":"2019-09-25T02:41:22.065+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"> do even worse than just banter\n\nYou're not doing yourself any favors by kidding yourself into thinking flaming and banter are interchangeable.

Both are feedback but one is toxic, the other is not.\n\nAlso - trash talking your teammates? That's a new one but I'm guessing your \"trash talk\" is coming across as flaming and since you have been repeatedly banned, you should know, or at least start to know, where the line is. \n\nYou don't instantly get banned for chat in game.

Sorry, too many people react to trash talk by purposely making the team lose, so fuck that. You talk shit to our teammate, and they troll in response, now i gotta lose because you want to have fun chatting.... no. And we all know that trolling is harder to confirm than simple chat offenses. \n\nThere is a perception that Riot does nothing about trolls, but as far as I know, its just a perception. I rarely encounter trolls, and we have no way of knowing how many trolls get punished. So if they could just work on that perception, thatd be great. But with some of the things that players seem to think indicate trolling (like a tristana jumping into the enemy team during a fight), that perception will never go away. Too many idiots who think bronze mistakes are \"trolling\". They kinda ruin it for those who are honest about troll encounters.","replies":[{"poster":"BangoDaMangoo","date":"2019-09-27T01:28:48.589+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i play low plat high gold, and the trolling im talking about is knowing that the enemy will one shot you but still deciding to go in the whole team, as in rocket jumping in.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BrightWîngs","date":"2019-09-25T10:25:52.496+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1.

If you are being trolled or being flamed just mute them and report them the system will take care of it. No need to add fuel to the fire and get your self in trouble or even escalate the situation with more toxicity in chat. You been banned because you posted trigger words people reported and the system caught you. Saying things like, stop inting, stop trolling, your just bad dude, all can be toxic to players, even asking for reports in all chat is toxic and does nothing. Riot has already stated that multiple reports do nothing to make the system go faster or punish them harder it only takes 1 report to flag them system and if something was found they get punished. The only time multiple reports work is of there is a report for multiple games aka 1 report each game for 5 games in a row for the same thing. Then the system see this and player gets punished.\n\nAgain just do not add more toxicity in game chat or all chat it only makes you look bad just ignore focus on your game report at end of game.
