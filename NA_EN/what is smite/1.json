I understand that tanks need an item to negate ADC&#039;s healing when they are on the frontline but this item completely fucks over {{champion:266}} , it&#039;s literally not fun to to have your entire dueling potential negated by one fucking cheap item. It&#039;s counter part {{item:3123}} isn&#039;t even a fucking rush item for ADC&#039;s even if the enemy team has a {{champion:16}} . The grevious wounds should be delayed until Thornmail is complete so that atleast champions who rely on auto attacks for healing aren&#039;t fucked in the early game, I understand the main purpose Riot even came up with {{item:3076}} was to curb Fiora&#039;s power in the top lane because she was running rampant. The idiocy of the item instantly turns any lane you&#039;ve won as {{champion:266}} into a lost lane and all that you&#039;re left with is push the lane and try to roam when the map is light up like a fucking christmas tree for the enemy team.\r\n\r\nTL;DR Move Bramble Vest&#039;s Grevious wounds portion to Thornmail, leave the damage reflect to the component item.","replies":[{"poster":"Melledoneus","date":"2018-03-17T01:25:50.991+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"First nerf Fiora, then we can look at nerfing Bramble Vest.","replies":[{"poster":"What Is Smite","date":"2018-03-17T01:34:14.734+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Melledoneus,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=dUPFKhuM,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2018-03-17T01:25:50.991+0000)\n>\n> First nerf Fiora, then we can look at nerfing Bramble Vest.\n\nThere are multiple ways to nerf Fiora. You can reduce her Base AD, Passive Scaling, frequency of Vital Marks showing on enemy champion (Think hit one, next one doesn't appear for X amount of seconds). From what I can tell about Fiora most of her power is concentrated around her passive giving her the True Damage, the most optimal solution would be to hit the frequency of how often there is a vital on an enemy champion. That would hit her early game damage while still allowing her to scale into her late game state, the marks would be similar to how Urgot's shotgun legs cooldown works. The higher her level the more frequent the marks appear, the scaling could be per level or it could take an approach like GP barrels where it 1/7/13.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-03-17T00:57:49.258+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Aatrox is getting a rework, no reason to gut the item and totally destroy balance in toplane just as a buff to him.","replies":[{"poster":"What Is Smite","date":"2018-03-17T01:28:17.068+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MagicFlyingLlama,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=dUPFKhuM,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2018-03-17T00:57:49.258+0000)\n>\n> Aatrox is getting a rework, no reason to gut the item and totally destroy balance in toplane just as a buff to him.\n\nHere's the thing though: More than likely he'll retain his healing from auto's. It's what makes him Iconic as a Darkin and what Introduced the Idea of Blood Magic to Runeterra. Bramble Vest will still cut whatever healing he's getting and void his laning phase and dueling potential, removing Bramble's Grievous Wounds in favor of a better damage reflect makes the item more healthy overall for those who purchase it. Just because a champion is getting a rework is not sufficient of a reason to just turn a blind eye to how the item impacts the champions who are walled by it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rexxiee","date":"2018-03-17T00:42:11.552+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":8,"body":"It should just be removed from the game, it has no reason to exist other than to break game balance.","replies":[]}]}
