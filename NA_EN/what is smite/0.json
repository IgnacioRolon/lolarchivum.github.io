Though the post wasn&#039;t mine, I was one of the many people who gave their input and criticism on Riot current Balance philosophy. Amongst the many people who did comment we generally didn&#039;t have a good opinion of the balance team&#039;s philosophy, there were even suggestions as to how the game&#039;s balance could be improved through different means. In any case the post was removed as when you try to access it you get a 404 error with the League of Legends background. What this shows to me is that if you&#039;re employee&#039;s are such snowflakes as they are unable to handle criticism from your playerbase then what&#039;s the point of keeping them in their position? I&#039;m not saying fire the balance team or anything, but at this point they are poisoning the game and slowly killing it by creating a bad atmosphere with the masses of people who play it.\r\n\r\nJust some food for thought.","replies":[]}
