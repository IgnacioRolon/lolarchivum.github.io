Suprisingly, the thread got deleted. i worked so hard and i made a poll and i told them why all permanent bans must be replaced with a month of a ban for this offense, and why the tribunal system must return. Riot is \n\n\nnot handling cases manually. 9\\10 Toxic player cases are automatically rolled out and judged by a bot, who will determine the punishment with no sort of logic implemented into it&#039;s \n\n\npattern. i can see what you are trying to do, i truly do. you don&#039;t want to get to the point when there will be that one guy who manages to bring out the truth of how flawed their system is. they don&#039;t want to retain this RESPONSIBILITY to take care of what they need to take care of. i am pretty sure it&#039;s getting to the point where you are litteraly doing \n\n\n\nwhat you are not suppost to do. you evading your responsibility, your community. now i don&#039;t care how hard it can be and how many cases there are to work on. it is YOUR COMMUNITY and you know you cannot let them handle themselves so why bother with the current system? i have no interest in explaining what Permanent bans were wrong in so many \n\n\n\nways, and why the current system is not working. The effect that came from the new system and riot&#039;s new method was very hard to notice. it produced almost no results, as i am witnessing the casual case of toxicity, hate speech and etc in games as we speak.

No one likes losing, ever, at all, period. It isn't fun or enjoyable to lose. So when you lose or are losing, you want to snap out or flip, or do whatever to vent. Now when you are the one losing, at times, teammates will flip out on you, why, because they don't want to lose either and perhaps they are on a losing streak themselves so to see someone losing them the game is only going to set them off. A cycle is created where losing causes more toxicity all around. Obviously, there are going to be outliers who are just general assholes, but for the most part, most people don't rage, troll, and/or flame 24/7 and that leads to the next problem.\n\nPeople who only do it one game or in every blue moon, HOWEVER, since it is YOUR one game, you automatically assume that they do it every game and thus deserve a ban. In all honest however, most people don't act like shit on a daily basis and in most of their games, and most of the time when they do, that is their one in a while. Let's be honest here, every single person here, me, you, everyone has been guilty of being that toxic asshole. We have all flamed, raged, trolled, afk intentionally, but most of us don't do it every game. Hell, I have done said things and never gotten a single warning, that is because I don't do it anymore because I realize that people are going to have bad games and at times what you consider trolling is just their bad game.\n\nAs for the system, while I don't agree with it and think the Tribunal was a FAR better system, I believe most people who get permabanned deserve it and don't deserve to come back. Do you know how much you have to rage to get even a warning? Like honestly, you keep hearing cases of people get punished ONLY because false reports, but that is bullshit, not a single person who whines about being permabanned has ever been permabanned by false reports only. See, the system works on a kind of safety net where it leves the fact that false reports do happen, it is why a shit ton of people never even see the warning, because of said net. What does happen however is that at times, people are toxic, then a set of false reports tips them over the scale to the later stages which is why I have no sympathy for anyone who reaches that stage, you know what you did and don't act like this came out of the blue either.\n\nAll in all, toxicity can never be fully controlled because that would be trying to police the internet which is impossible. All you can do is mitigate it as best you can.","replies":[{"poster":"PROJECT Fizz","date":"2016-01-11T19:27:41.550+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dude! You know how to cut paragraphs?

Pre and post-game logs are reviewed individually if a comment is made in the report referencing them. If the system detects a word or phrase deemed bannable, the system acts and gives the appropriate punishment. There is a tier system for these words, and based on the tier and frequency, the system can issue a more severe punishment.\n\nAs for deleting the thread, a reason why the thread was deleted should exist by clicking the exclamation point in the upper right corner.

The current punishment system is designed to give you warnings to change your behavior, or if you refuse, to simply leave the game altogether.\n\n*  What makes you think that a month ban would reform the players behavior? \n\n* Whats to stop them from coming back and being just as toxic as they were before they were banned?

I don't think that the observation system would work in my opinion. If players were allowed to call a Riot employee to view the game, I don't think Riot would have the man power. I wrote a post the other day after I did some math on how many people would be required by Riot to view every game. I came down to the conclusion that Riot would need approximately 75,000 more employees than they already have. At the cost of basic living expenses, I estimated that Riot would spend $3.75 billion dollars just to spectate games.\n\nNow with the call feature, let's high-ball and say that only 10 percent of the games got a call for a Riot employee. That is still 7,500 employees that Riot would need to hire. (Employees are watching 3 games at a time in this estimate) $375 Million would be required to play for these employees, so you can kind of see that a system such as this could potentially be unfeasible.\n\nNow if you're worried about your account, I have a suggestion or two. I play music every time that I play. I have playlists to offset any mood I'm in. When I want to rage, I play a calming playlist, and it keeps me in check. I often yell out at my computer rather in chat. I played 2-3 games last night and had 2 games where someone insisted on either trolling or just trying something WAY off-meta. I have no problems with off-meta picks, but these were almost borderline. I yelled AT my screen rather that typing something to them in chat. In the last week I've played quite a few games and have MAYBE typed 25 times in chat.\n\nI'm a extremely competitive person, so I understand wanting to win, even in normals. I haven't ever received punishment because my friends taught me something early on. They told me to focus on my lane only. Unless someone asks for advice on how to play a champion, you don't need to tell them how to play. Everyone has their own style. Some will be right. Some will be wrong. Yelling at them will never change their playstyle. If you want to tell a teammate or opponent something, save it for a post-game chat. If I try to give someone a tip, I always ask if I can give them some advice. Even if you're mad about how they played, be polite about how you approach them. \n\nI wish you the best of luck man. I hope you can find what works for you to stay positive.\n\nHave a Good Day.

You should really add the options, even if they oppose your goal, or you just look inflexible. Also, that means you cant face that most people might disagree.
