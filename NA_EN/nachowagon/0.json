Any help is appreciated.\n\nThe difference between tilting and going on a simple losing streak is\n\n1.   Emotional State -  This is the single key factor affected by \"tilting\". When you're on tilt, your mood will swing easily from positive to negative. You become a **pessimist** .  Every time you see something bad happening like losing a teamfight, dying teammates, or maybe missing skillshots, you become very negative. You might go as far as typing defeatist attitude things in chat like \"GG, /FF AT 20 / afk in base\"\n\n\n2.   Individual performance -  Your emotional state can start affecting your performance in your games . If you're feeling negative and start performing badly because of it, this is how you know you're on tilt. If you're on tilt, you might make irrational decisions that lead to you dying alot in your games.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AirSonance","date":"2015-07-19T05:49:50.663+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A loosing streak is just that: continued loss of games. Tilting, however, is when you're getting emotional (angry, sad, anxious, etc) and letting those emotions influence your decision making. The difference is while one will kinda just happen, the other is completely on you to control.\n\nLoosing streaks will happen, but try to remember not to tilt if it does happen and you keep playing anyway.","replies":[]}]}
