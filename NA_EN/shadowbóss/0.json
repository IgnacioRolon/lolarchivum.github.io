LIKE...in the 1st game, phanteon even made mom jokes, and said he didn't care about me reporting him , second game i went a bit over the line yeah, but just because my tristana was inting , went to his op.gg and he hadn't played a game in so long that his match history was empty, and obviously i get mad that the bad player is on my team, in the end of second game i was so tilted that i even told her to get cancer, shouldn't have, i know its just a video game, but for that i think 14 days or chat restricted would be enough.\r\nActually sad, hope riot re****thinks this because they just lost a dedicated diamond player trying to climb..\r\n\r\n****Pre-Game\r\nShadowBóss: https://www.twitch.tv/shadowbss\r\nShadowBóss: may i mid?\r\nIn-Game\r\nShadowBóss: just cuz stylish does it\r\nShadowBóss: doenst mean its good\r\nShadowBóss: tried it\r\nShadowBóss: its sht\r\nShadowBóss: can i get\r\nShadowBóss: some kinda of help\r\nShadowBóss: lik\r\nShadowBóss: ...\r\nShadowBóss: 5th time\r\nShadowBóss: in a row\r\nShadowBóss: phant\r\nShadowBóss: ur trolling\r\nShadowBóss: free double every time\r\nShadowBóss: why you ignoring mid\r\nShadowBóss: top*\r\nShadowBóss: just why\r\nShadowBóss: reporting this guy\r\nShadowBóss: i am done\r\nShadowBóss: phateon\r\nShadowBóss: ur trolling\r\nShadowBóss: got dove  like 4 timnes\r\nShadowBóss: how braindead to meantion score\r\nShadowBóss: prob phant\r\nShadowBóss: phanteon\r\nShadowBóss: ur gonna get reported\r\nShadowBóss: grief\r\nShadowBóss: ur grifing your team\r\nShadowBóss: noo\r\nShadowBóss: yi is alwaysd there\r\nShadowBóss: and ur always not there\r\nShadowBóss: ur a fucking trash\r\nShadowBóss: farming all game and still behind in cs\r\nShadowBóss: mom jokes\r\nShadowBóss: yikes\r\nShadowBóss: ..\r\nShadowBóss: cant argue with you\r\nShadowBóss: braindead\r\nShadowBóss: dude\r\nShadowBóss: ur getting banned\r\nShadowBóss: if we all report you\r\nShadowBóss: i hape the rest do aswell\r\nShadowBóss: what do you mean\r\nShadowBóss: you  ignored top\r\nShadowBóss: yi dove me 5 times\r\nShadowBóss: you do nothing\r\nShadowBóss: its called troll~\r\nShadowBóss: r%%%%%ed\r\nShadowBóss: phanteon\r\nShadowBóss: u ignored lanes\r\nShadowBóss: i dont get it\r\nShadowBóss: other team's phant\r\nShadowBóss: goes 20\\0\r\nShadowBóss: and solo carries\r\nShadowBóss: yi bot\r\nShadowBóss: we lost 5v3\r\nShadowBóss: 5v4*\r\nShadowBóss: Gg\r\nShadowBóss: report phant\r\nGame 2\r\nPre-Game\r\nShadowBóss: https://discord.gg/bxQn4W\r\nShadowBóss: join discord\r\nIn-Game\r\nShadowBóss: yikes\r\nShadowBóss: Q faster\r\nShadowBóss: what\r\nShadowBóss: i saw oriana\r\nShadowBóss: are you blind\r\nShadowBóss: triusty\r\nShadowBóss: you gotta be blind\r\nShadowBóss: why\r\nShadowBóss: did you go\r\nShadowBóss: wen you saw ori\r\nShadowBóss: why\r\nShadowBóss: fucking\r\nShadowBóss: braindead\r\nShadowBóss: what is going on bot\r\nShadowBóss: is this for real\r\nShadowBóss: what is this...\r\nShadowBóss: my eyes\r\nShadowBóss: tristana\r\nShadowBóss: that level of int\r\nShadowBóss: is beyond stupid\r\nShadowBóss: reporting this bot\r\nShadowBóss: cant fucking\r\nShadowBóss: play this no more\r\nShadowBóss: actualy sad\r\nShadowBóss: how bad\r\nShadowBóss: gotta be boosted\r\nShadowBóss: FUCK YOU ALL\r\nShadowBóss: SO BAD\r\nShadowBóss: GET CANBCER\r\nShadowBóss: fuck you\r\nShadowBóss: all\r\nPost-Game\r\nShadowBóss: fuck you all\r\nShadowBóss: legit\r\nShadowBóss: just fucking\r\nShadowBóss: get cancer\r\nShadowBóss: fuck you","replies":[{"poster":"Prandine","date":"2019-07-31T21:42:02.471+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"While Necromancy may be handy (and sometimes needed) in media, it's not the case for old forum threads.

No matter the situation, you cannot break the rules and expect to get off scot-free. Other people breaking the rules doesn't mean you should do the same.\n\n> everyone flames when they have a 0\\9 tristana , like is that worth a PERMA ban??? \n\nNo, they don't. Mind you that permanent suspensions aren't issued right away. You have to work your way up to them, going through other punishment tiers first. To put it simply, a permanent suspension is a conglomeration of all the things you did wrong over an extended period of time. This isn't just about severity anymore, it's about **consistency** as well.","replies":[{"poster":"jeasus is justin","date":"2019-07-31T10:24:56.836+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Bianca Colt,realm=EUW,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=otjhYEJl,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2019-01-21T15:10:08.125+0000)\n>\n> You're not allowed to do that.

There are so may people who are more toxic than that and what do you you with them? The answer is nothing (for the most part). Literally every game I encounter at least one person so toxic that he woluld make my parents commit suicide just by reading his first sentince, and what happens when 2-4 people report him you might ask? Absolutely nothing. Riot's player behaviour management team is absolutely an inconsistent doggshit, because you know what? It's easier to just throw your hands in the air and give up on reviewing the reports on legit trolls and toxic people and call it a day, than to put thought and focus on thinking about what that particulair person did and if it should be punished.  And then you come to the forums give big words of wisdon 'You were rightfully banned\" or 'You musnt break the rules at all cost for you not to recive punishment' (As if we didn't know already) and try to alure us with a false sense of care and responsibillity for the people's experience of the game.  And you dare speak of consistancy. Please tell me how many games have you had with toxic people, and couldn't wait till the post game menu just to report them and hope the would get banned? Too many to count, huh? If you understood than you might have a slight glimpse into how I feel\nBy the big words of papa Franku (Resting in peice 2013 - 2018) 'Know you place, trash'.","replies":[{"poster":"Imperial Pandaa","date":"2019-07-31T10:31:52.648+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1.
