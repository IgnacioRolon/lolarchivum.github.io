Also why I sounded like a complete douche when I flamed him this game. I mean we flame each other in discord way worse, but at the end of the day we still are bros and no hard feelings. Its just dudes flaming each other as a joke. Like I dont actually mean hes trash ive seen him when he plays good (a lot) im just mocking his play/s.\nAlso im xerath this game, we have a tris, pyke, Kha (I think), and yorick.\nEnemy team had garen and fizz, im unsure about jg and bot lane.\nIn-Game\nStaySaltyBaby: WHY TF\nStaySaltyBaby: IS BOTLANE AT TOWER\nStaySaltyBaby: GO TO RED\nStaySaltyBaby: or just let mid die\nStaySaltyBaby: dumbass\n-Adc flamed me for dying when I was checking my phone for a sec and he said \"I want to be at wave first\" I said \"or just let mid die\" called him a dumbass for not pinging when they could have looked at mini and warned me about the enemys/\nStaySaltyBaby: no\nStaySaltyBaby: shh\nStaySaltyBaby: love pings in this elo\n-Not bannable\nStaySaltyBaby: ur first actual good play\nStaySaltyBaby: he has a q dash\nStaySaltyBaby: that w\nStaySaltyBaby: bro ur shark always misses\nStaySaltyBaby: im only in its circle\nStaySaltyBaby: why are riven and pyke switched\nStaySaltyBaby: im a xerath GOD\n-pyke complained about fizzs dashes and how its worse than yas. I cant remember if this was is in discord or not.\nStaySaltyBaby: didnt remember asking u something 2-4\nStaySaltyBaby: u pulled him away from dmg4\nStaySaltyBaby: cause ur bad\n-pyke  pulled him away from my q and w when he was stunned by e.\nStaySaltyBaby: what?\nStaySaltyBaby: ALSO\nStaySaltyBaby: GTFO\nStaySaltyBaby: LEMME SOLO PUSH\n-Adc went to every lane I went and just took cs from me\nStaySaltyBaby: mf\nStaySaltyBaby: what the fuck is ur build\nThe enemy mf had like manamune and deaths dance and like executioners calling. I just called him out on his build. We didnt say anything to each before that or after that. It was in a joking way aswell\nStaySaltyBaby: ur death was not in vain\n-Pyke died so I could make a sneaky escape.\nStaySaltyBaby: but ur still trash\n-Again in a joking way he even sent a (: u too in discord.\nStaySaltyBaby: ok fizz\nStaySaltyBaby: ur a little bitch\n-Fizz litterally just sat back and when r came back he just rushed me and popped me. He never fought during laning phase didnt go for minions and sat away from my q range making me pretty infuriated, but not mad.\nStaySaltyBaby: DEFEND\nStaySaltyBaby: OVER ATTACK\nStaySaltyBaby: RECALL\n-I dont even remember the reason for this, but I think I was talking to my team with \"DEFEND\" and \"RECALL\" and I think \"OVER ATTACK\" was for the enemy team.\nStaySaltyBaby: worst jg na\nKha or at least I think was our jg jumped into a 1v4 and barely managed to make one of em go to half health\nStaySaltyBaby: THANKS\nStaySaltyBaby: PUSH EM AWAY FROM ME\nPyke pulled them out of my q w with his q and yes I used push instead of pull like a pepega.\nStaySaltyBaby: im litterally the nly person doing anything rn\nStaySaltyBaby: also spicy stfu\nStaySaltyBaby: u havent done anything\nPyke flamed me (again we do this in a joking way)\nStaySaltyBaby: TRIS ur useless\nStaySaltyBaby: u dont do anything\nStaySaltyBaby: and u dont know how to play ur champ\nStaySaltyBaby: u dont do dmg\n-Tris was saying I cant do anything to change the game and im useless. At this point in the game I could kill their adc with e q or w q.\nStaySaltyBaby: well im full build\nStaySaltyBaby: dont take blue\nStaySaltyBaby: i need it\nStaySaltyBaby: do u want to lose the game\nStaySaltyBaby: u morons\nStaySaltyBaby: im the only one doing dmg\nTris and Kha went and took blue as I was right next to them or at least in range to kill it with q.\nStaySaltyBaby: I ONE SHOT THEIR TANKS\nStaySaltyBaby: WHY WOULD U Q HIM TO ME\nStaySaltyBaby: WTF IS WRONG WITH U\nStaySaltyBaby: gg\nStaySaltyBaby: SEAN U FUCKNG PULLED HIM ON ME\n-Pyke pulled garen on me and he r'd also his name is not Sean he just looks like Sean the sheep and its a inside joke we have with our friend group.\nStaySaltyBaby: no u didnt\n-Pyke he said that he actually pushed him away from me.\nStaySaltyBaby: of course im toxic\nStaySaltyBaby: im playing with monkeys on my team\n-Tris was saying im toxic and ill admit I was toxic, but didnt actually say anything toxic to anyone and I was joking about what I said to pyke and he was too.\nStaySaltyBaby: okay prove it\nStaySaltyBaby: get a triple\nStaySaltyBaby: show me ur worth\n-Tris was saying she know how to play her champ and that she can carry and I told her to prove it.\nStaySaltyBaby: end the game\nStaySaltyBaby: all mid\nStaySaltyBaby: gj team for once\nStaySaltyBaby: (:\n-We won the game and I sent a joke which made Tris the only person that we actually had a little argument, but we were not flaming each other send a \"lol u too\" or just \"lol\" Im not sure.\nPost-Game\nStaySaltyBaby: lol\nStaySaltyBaby: at 94\nStaySaltyBaby: gg\nStaySaltyBaby: 1 honor ):\nStaySaltyBaby: ty (:\n-Tris honored me \"For staying cool\" and we even friended each other (I think I just remember friending a lot of people these last few days), but we didnt que together cause I just went to bed.\nIf u guys wanna veirfy that I was joking around with Pyke just msg Stay Spicy, again a good friend of mine irl.\nEdit: I dont think riot would ban me for calling one person a bitch and nothing else, that is litterally the only thing that I cannot defend myself. These are the two games where I was BANNED for. Telling people they are bad, but not arguing or getting angry. I told the enemy mf that her build was questionable, I told my morde \"I NEVER LOSE WITH GRASP\" in a mocking way. I didnt tell anyone they are playing like dogshit, I told my friend who we both knew was in a joking way. I called out the fizz being scared a \"bitch\" because he only went in with r and jg. No one told me to shutup or to stop flaming infact they did the opposite the mord started threatening to int if I didnt shutup. So I did and he still inted. Then I said to report him for being toxic. When I jokingly flamed my friend not a single person told me to shutup or be quiet.
