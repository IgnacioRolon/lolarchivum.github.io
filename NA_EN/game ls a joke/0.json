{"poster":"GAME lS A JOKE","date":"2016-03-31T09:22:24.946+0000","title":"Karthus, Boots of Swiftness,  Hexdrinker, and AD Manaless Champions Analysis","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":152,"down_votes":11,"body":"**A:**  {{champion:30}}  is one of the oldest champions in the game. He was part of the card game before this online game even came out. He was released into the game on June 12th of 2009 if I recall correctly. 1 out of every 200 normal/ranked games combined I will see 1 enemy Karthus player. Despite this disappointing and somewhat inaccurate statistic by me, I and a few others still keep him alive even in Season 6. This post is originally motivated by a Karthus Survey I got two weeks ago from LoL after finishing a game with Karthus. The survey asked if I was satisfied with his kit and whether or not a rework was in favor. The oldschool nostalgia part of me wants to keep Karthus the same way, but there is also a part of me that would be interested with some non-visual and actual game-play reworks.\n\nKarthus used to be known to be a terrifying lich in the earlier seasons. I remember scarletdoom and Reginald were the first two in NA back in Season 1 to bring light on him. After a while though, the newer champions were stronger and the kits were all designed to maneuver around Karthus. \nMany people in ranked dodge because they don&#039;t like when I pick Karthus. They&#039;re so used to seeing champions like {{champion:238}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:103}}  (and recently an ADC mid... shame on you riot. {{champion:42}} ) in the mid lane. While it is true that it&#039;s harder on my end to carry because of how unpopular and easily countered Karthus is, I have not given up on him. I have had many toxic players tell me to &#039;Uninstall and never play Karthus again&#039; over the past 6 seasons, but because I ignored them and have played him consistently, I somehow manage to make him work. \n\nAlthough recently, he has indirectly taken a huge hit. One of his core items is building {{item:3116}} (3200g), mostly since:\n\n-Karthus has no escapes other than Flash (sometimes Teleport can be used if the enemy has no interrupts to stop it)\n-No hard cc&#039;s other than his Wall which Slows.\n-Karthus Q is very Low-Cooldown so Rylais is usually a good item to rush on him.\n\n**B:**\n\nChampions with no escapes and only a slow like, {{champion:21}} {{champion:96}} {{champion:30}}  are suffering from 3 major changes recently. The only way these champions can out-play is by not only having flawless positioning in high elo (due to not having any escapes other than Flash), but also being able to use their Slows to close the gap effectively and secure kills this way.\n\n1.  Patch 5.13 implemented that Slows no longer Stack, which I was fine with for Karthus because Wall + Rylais was almost the equivalent of a Wither Slow from {{champion:75}} .\n\n2. {{item:3009}} (900g) is not only argueably one of the top 2 fastest boots, but also provides a significant 25% slow-resistance factor. \n\n\n3. Under Masteries there is now Swiftness under the Resolve Tree: Offers 15% Tenacity AND 15% Slow Resistance. You can only imagine how toxic this can get with champions like {{champion:39}} {{champion:77}} and anyone who combines this with {{item:3009}}  or {{item:3111}} .\n\nFor a mere 900g, you can completely negate out both {{item:3116}}  and the core-kits of champions who only have 1 slow and no escapes. This is way too cost-effective for any elo game-play.\n\n\n**C:**  {{item:3155}} : Is there truly a Mage Counterpart to this 1300g Item?\n\nI&#039;m glad to hear that this item is being nerfed on the PBE along with many threads I recently reviewed this month under Gameplay dealing with Hexdrinker.\nBuying {{item:3191}}  doesn&#039;t cut it anymore. \n\n{{item:3155}}  offers:\n-AD an Offensive Stat\n-Magic Resist a Defensive Stat\n-A shield that automatically procs for you 100% of the time (meaning you don&#039;t have to activate it via pressing 1-6) 110-280 Magic Shield that NOT ONLY gets quantified by the MR on the Item, BUT ALSO gets quantified by the Total MR you have which usually almost every role takes Glyph Magic Resist runes for how effective they are. Some may argue &#039;oh 110 isn&#039;t that much&#039; but realistically if you multiply 110 x the MR factor, it represents a higher number than displayed. This shield is anti-mage-assassin because it makes securing kills significantly harder the earlier you buy this 1300g item. This is why AD Champions like {{champion:42}} {{champion:238}} {{champion:157}} are exclusively played in the higher elos recently.\n\n{{item:3191}} 1200g  some may claim is the mage counterpart but it offers:\n\n-AP an Offensive Stat\n-Armor a Defensive Stat\n-Absolutely no Shield that Auto Procs 100% of the time and isn&#039;t quantified by NOT ONLY the armor on the item, but possible armor from Runes/Masteries.\n-The item starts off very weak in comparison to Hexdrinker which is already at it&#039;s full power from purchase. You have to farm 30 minions before it&#039;s of any use. It also doesn&#039;t prevent AD Mids from securing/finishing off kills similar to the auto-proc shield on {{item:3155}} .\n\n\n**D:** AD Mana-less Champions {{champion:266}}  {{champion:36}} {{champion:150}}  {{champion:64}}{{champion:58}} {{champion:107}} {{champion:92}} {{champion:98}} {{champion:23}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:238}}  and some others I probably forgot.\n\n-Base Energy Regen is significantly quicker than Base Mana Regen.\n-Mana-less Champions don&#039;t have to worry about building Maximum Mana or Mana Regen items. They can straight up rush Defensive or purely offensive items.\n\nLet&#039;s look at the starter items as well:\n\n{{item:1056}} : Offers Mana Regen, just to barely sustain in lane. Absolutely NO spellvamp or health healed from killing minions.\n\n{{item:1055}} : Offers 3% lifesteal.\n\nI&#039;ve seen on countless games {{item:1055}} 1 potion OUT-sustains {{item:1056}} 2 potions, especially on mana-less AD Mids like {{champion:238}} {{champion:157}} . \n\nIf a mage all-in&#039;s them they have to use up a massive resource of mana. The manaless AD mids can then either lifesteal from Crab, Jungle camps, or the minions in lane safely far in the back. Sometimes they can just straightup continue to lifesteal up front because the Mage runs out of mana, which means they get free turret damage, more cs, or even earlier roaming.\n\nThey can straight up rush {{item:3155}} for 1300g, while most mages have to go either {{item:3165}} ,{{item:3070}} ,{{item:3027}} just to manage their Mana Consumption.\n\nIf both the Mana Mage and the Manaless AD Mid both blew their cooldowns, the AD Mid would also be able to lifesteal, attack speed, possible crit, and higher attack damage overall in the time that these cooldowns are in place for both champions.\n\nI&#039;m not saying its 100% impossible to beat Zed and Yasuo mids, as I have from time and time again defeated them over 3 seasons. I&#039;m just saying that if a mage bought {{item:3191}} {{item:1056}}  VS. a Zed/Yasuo who bought {{item:1055}} {{item:3155}} , the {{champion:238}} {{champion:157}}  would overall have a better chance at winning trades, sustaining in lane from lifesteal, and consequently gank lanes earlier and siege earlier than mana mages. \n\n\nIt&#039;s just sad to see Karthus completely countered by {{item:3009}}900g and {{item:3155}}1300g . A total cost of 2200g which can be easily obtained before 20 minutes. It completely negates {{item:3191}}1200g and {{item:3116}}3200g which is a total cost of 4400g a whopping twice the amount, let&#039;s not forget Karthus also has to buy {{item:3070}} 750g just to barely be on terms with wave clear and poking. So a total of 5150g countered by 2200g.\n\n\nI think it would be cool if maybe we did a similar rework like {{champion:27}} where if he flips into the Slow, the enemy gets rooted for a set duration.\n\nIf {{champion:30}} lands a Q it will create 1 Stack of Pain, this stack depletes similar to Thunderlord after 3 seconds, if Karthus can land 5 Q&#039;s consequtively without missing 1, then maybe it could root the enemy for 1-2 seconds based on level?\n\nRealistically in high elo, landing 5 Karthus Q&#039;s in a row is very rare. It&#039;s just an idea I thought of. Or maybe if Karthus uses Wall of Pain and within the 3-5 seconds of Slow, manages to land 3-5 Q&#039;s, it roots them in place for 1-2 seconds?\n\n\n\n**Overall Conclusion:** I&#039;m glad Zed and Hexdrinker are getting nerfed on PBE, and I also think Boots of Swiftness offers too much Slow Resistance when stacked with 15% Tenacity/15% slow from Swiftness under Resolve tree. I think building {{item:3191}} doesn&#039;t cut it anymore and {{item:3155}} is way too cost effective. I also think {{item:3116}} and champions with only slows are easily countered by a mere 900g Item {{item:3009}} . I think mana-less AD Mids have better laning phase, quicker sieging, waveclear, lifesteal sustenance, and earlier ganking than most mages midlane.\n\n\nSome links I&#039;d like to promote because they inspired me to write this:\n\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/uBgaYjW6-we-have-all-purpose-shields-and-magic-damage-shields?\n\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/EljQkgEE-zed-is-getting-nerfed-on-pbe\n\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/O1AYhOJl-why-are-4-ad-team-comps-support-ok\n\nand most importantly:\n\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/9EwiAKRV-does-riot-really-think-this-is-okay\n\n\nCheers!

Their energy system is balanced, For example you cannot spam your spells, you have to manage your energy. You cannot randomly press buttons since you'll get out of energy. basically you cannot spam those, you have to use combos to regain energy, and also manage it properly. On the other hand, with mana you have to watch out when you are getting low.\n\nExcept with energy champions, once you learn a combo to do damage and regain energy, you have no more worries. Ever.  A mana user can use their combos, but they still have to buy mana regen items and there's never a point where they can continuously stay in lane without worrying about running out of mana.\nLook at it like this:\n\"I have this battery in my radio. If I don't blast my radio at 100% volume, the battery charges itself and will never run out.\" \nAs opposed to:\n\"I have this battery in my radio. It will only last 5 minutes unless I buy this backup battery for it, and then it only lasts 10 minutes until it can recharage itself.\"\n\nAnd to the OP's main point, a caster has to go back and buy a mana item, which in early levels, have no offensive stats. An energy user doesn't have to buy anything to sustain themselves and can go straight for their offensive item of choice. What this means is that a caster always loses momentum against an energy champion because an energy champion can always out-damage them and either kill them faster or bully them from the lane more.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2016-03-31T16:06:09.412+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think Mundo is more AP scaling than he is AD.

And if you wanted more mana regen, you would have to sacrifice the 5% damage gained from masteries where energy and manaless champs do not.","replies":[{"poster":"GAME lS A JOKE","date":"2016-04-01T13:14:18.676+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah basically this :D","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GAME lS A JOKE","date":"2016-04-01T02:50:50.348+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have played energy champions and I've noticed the base Energy Regen is significantly quicker than the Base Mana Regen.

I know you don't see it much, but this can probably ruin karthus's day. Karthus is very squishy, and only has his wall as an escape. If you deal 1/3 of karthus's already small pool of hp, you gain a ton of movement speed and 75% slow resistance. I know it's not common, but it's something you may want to look out for.\n\nMaybe a nerf to boots of swiftness is what srs needs to become a \"legit keystone\" mastery. I've had a lot of people doubt me when I take this mastery bursty champions like Viegar, who don't combo very well without their ult (as to abuse Thunderlords) and need something in the early game because games end so early, making Deathfire Touch... lacking in this meta. I've gotten out of some pretty sticky situations just by landing a Veigar W. I've gotten away from a nasus who withered me, because I bursted the crap of of one of his allies. I was able to get far enough ahead to trap in in my cage, so wither wore off long before Nasus was in any position to come after me.\n\nI honestly don't know why Riot reduced the cost on boots of swiftness; because it's 200 g cheaper, it's too darn popular, in my opinion.","replies":[{"poster":"GAME lS A JOKE","date":"2016-03-31T15:39:27.015+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's very true.
