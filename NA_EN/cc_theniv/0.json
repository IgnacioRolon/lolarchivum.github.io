Regardless of intent, disconnecting from a match negatively impacts *everyone* in the match. Additionally, you'll never get a 5-game penalty for disconnecting from a single match and it takes a *consistent trend* of disconnections before you see such a penalty.\n\nIf you have any further issues with this, please let me know so we can work together to resolve it. Let me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}
