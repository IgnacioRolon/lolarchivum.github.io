It's healthier and allows Eve & other stealth champions for some buffs.\n\nI wouldn't mind seeing stealth (or at least permanent stealth) being somewhat similar to HOTS because in HOTS its literally there to give the person with stealth an advantage by being harder to see not impossible to see without specific things. Sure they still don't appear on the map, but the blur is often enough to give away a stealthed hero in higher skilled games (I made it up to rank 10 in HOTS which is about equal to platinum in League) and it isn't that bad. In HoTS it stomps noobs and people who are too focused on their own lane.\n\nI also want to mention that HOTS has both stealths on Assassins which are basically the HOTS version of high damage and squishy people (because there are both melee and ranged carries in this game, and their meta is closer to caster carries). Evelyn on the other hand is basically a bruiser or AP Assassin with stealth. One way she basically runs at someone from anywhere she pleases and slowly kills them and can survive quite awhile. The other way she just goes in and nukes everyone in her path because her abilities do scale pretty well with AP and it's itemization but she will die instantly to any kind of hard CC. The problem with both is that its a high damage nuker with low CDs that can just sit in plain sight and you know she is probably there but she can run around in your vision range without consequence.","replies":[{"poster":"Saianna","date":"2015-10-06T01:01:14.637+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd argue with Evelynn having a nuke.\n\nTrue her E does have 1.0 AP ratio with decent base damage, but it still deals AD damage.\nIt still can deal decent amount of damage, but nowhere near what I'd call a \"nuke\".\n\nWhile her Q deals magic damage.

It being physical damage just means that early game you have to choose do you wanna be sustain magic damage to death or nuked with physical damage.\n\nI agree with OP. As it stands eve will be near impossible to balance because her stealth. The same goes for Shaco. I don't think adding another type of ward as suggested before is the answer. If adding an item to the game is how you balance a champion then that means the champion is simply too broken to fix with conventional means.\n\nMaybe altering how her passive works with greens wards? She can be revealed with green wards but does not show on map. I'm not sure how she can be balanced so long as she can permanently stealth.","replies":[{"poster":"Vekkna","date":"2015-10-06T16:32:04.635+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or just add the Mandrake functionality to green wards and sightstone but not trinket wards until upgraded.","replies":[{"poster":"Br4ndon","date":"2015-10-06T21:19:31.440+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Vekkna,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=MEubM8Aa,comment-id=000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2015-10-06T16:32:04.635+0000)\n>\n> Or just add the Mandrake functionality to green wards and sightstone but not trinket wards until upgraded.\n\nThat could work but i still feel like altering how wards work for a single champion sucks.

Omg are you denying the OPness that is Evelyn, are you saying the ability to completely ignore wards(except for pinks of course), and to top it all of having the versatility to be built ad/ap(ad triforce tank is my favorite a malmortius should be in here somewhere) isn't something to be kept in check. \n\nMy friend Eve has heavy cc once she hits 6 plus her ult grants a shield for EACH CHAMPION HIT and does % HP damage.

She should be able to get on the ADC by using the terrain or just flanking from a direction the adc isn't expecting. Then once she's close she should use her ult for the slow, then finally use her speed up to either finish of the ADC if she has enough damage or escape with it if she doesn't.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"SwapShadows","date":"2015-10-24T03:07:53.739+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bump because delusional evelyn mains trying to fool players into believing that eve is in need of buffs and that she's completely healthy.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Droogzy","date":"2015-10-06T22:18:38.972+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Eve doesn't really need nerfs though.
