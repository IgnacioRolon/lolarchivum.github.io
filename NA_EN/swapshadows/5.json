Look at Ashe, or characters like Sej and Yi who are polar opposites in the jungle, or any utility mage, these characters do bring something a little different from the bulk standard of their role and they're all fine.\n\nThe bulk standard of the support role is basically to be a tanky disrupter, secondarily you have utility mages who have both strong disruption and often other utilities like shields and heals. At the moment Sona isn't either of these things, she's somewhere between Veigar and Lux in terms of play style despite being a support by position, although I don't think that comparison really pays respect to how utterly unique Sona is.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
