On the other hand a fail design is one that requires barely any thinking and limits your options in different  situations, having success with these types of kits means you have to get used to spamming the same combo over and over and over without any kind of altering or very little needed.\n\nLet&#039;s look at kits that I feel are successful \n{{champion:238}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:412}} {{champion:268}} {{champion:103}} {{champion:62}} {{champion:236}} (etc)\nWhy do I think these kits are successful? disregard numbers or anything like that, these champions have so many options that are completely dependant on the users knowledge. You can tell when you&#039;re up against a god zed or a amateur zed, you can tell when that thresh is on his 1000th thresh game or on his 1st thresh game.

His Q: used to be a single targeted stun scaling with AP and is now an AoE channeled knockup. Complete change. His W: Used to be a shield scaling with AP which would combine with his Q and lich bane to basically just instagib squishy targets and now it's a shield scaling with his HP and tacked on his old E stacking health mechanic. His E: Used to be just an AD steroid at the cost of health per hit and had his health stacking mechanic on it and now it's a skillshot armor reducing slow that can also launch minions. His Ult: used to be a bunch of lifesteal and attack speed and is now the 'pain train' or whatever you want to call it. As for his passive, it used to just block damage as a semi-useful lane tool and his passive now is a cool thematic thing that's occasionally really clutch in finishing someone off in a close fight. \n\nSo, do we see all of those COMPLETE changes?

Make a champion who has no cc, no range, and no mobility (but a fuckton of damage), actually viable. They decided to maintain his identity of no cc, range, and mobility by putting him with a support who can provide those things. It makes sense. ADC's often have weaknesses they need they're team to cover up for. The problem was that Mord was overtuned. His w passive was probably meant to persuade people into trying him bot but it's to strong. ADC's don't scale with levels, other classes do, so he naturally gets a advantage just for existing.\n\nI also like the idea of the dragon but feel it's too hard to kill. Again, the idea makes sense. If Mord if the adc your seige is going to be lacking, so they give him something to make up for that. The problem is that, as I said, it's hard as hell to kill. You go from having good siege to \"I'm just gonna take this tower and you can't really stop me.\" On top of that, he gets dragon too easily. He'll be ahead in levels and he naturally pushes the wave with normal farming.\n\nI do like CertainT's designs but I feel like the execution behind them is their only problem. With someone who's linear like Annie, it's easy to balance her numbers since she's only do one thing. With someone like Yasuo, there's so many more interactions and uses you have to account for.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Malicious Metal","date":"2015-10-19T15:52:10.511+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"My thoughts exactly.","replies":[{"poster":"KONO RUBICK DA","date":"2015-10-19T15:55:46.193+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Malicious Metal,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=4u26rGEt,comment-id=00000001,timestamp=2015-10-19T15:52:10.511+0000)\n>\n> My thoughts exactly.\n\nexplain what is the \"box\"","replies":[{"poster":"Malicious Metal","date":"2015-10-19T16:00:58.739+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"The box is Thresh's ultimate which creates four walls that slow by 99% and deal magic damage.","replies":[{"poster":"KONO RUBICK DA","date":"2015-10-19T16:02:02.274+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Malicious Metal,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=4u26rGEt,comment-id=0000000100000000,timestamp=2015-10-19T16:00:58.739+0000)\n>\n> The box is Thresh's ultimate which creates four walls that slow by 99% and deal magic damage.\n\nit makes no sens, how is he \"thinking\" outside the box?","replies":[{"poster":"redniwediS","date":"2015-10-19T16:23:12.661+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's a common phrase in English, you may want to just look it up.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Critmaster Garen","date":"2015-10-19T16:17:42.117+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Solomon Money,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=4u26rGEt,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-10-19T15:48:41.106+0000)\n>\n> I like that he can think outside the box \n> \n> I don't like that this usual creative thinking didn't apply to Mordekaiser\n\nbut it did. who would have thought of letting morde take the ghost of the drake or put him in as a bot lane fighter so hes able to siege turrets with it?\n\nmorde might need work, but te concept is pretty awesome.","replies":[{"poster":"Big Lincoln","date":"2015-10-19T16:55:52.319+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"that's not really.. interesting, nor something that anyone really wanted after the initial hype of \"oh wow a dragon ghost\" went away\n\nwould prefer power that's accessible more than once every six minutes","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"LVL 5 PORO","date":"2015-10-19T20:44:42.673+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd hate whoever made Yasuo so its nothing personal.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2015-10-19T17:32:41.208+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Strange.\n\nThe reasons that you like CertainlyT's designs are the reasons I don't like them.

Why pick a champion who is good at engage if you can pick a champion who has engage, disengage, a shield, a heal, is tanky, good base damage, etc... It doesn't feel good to be vulnerable in some way, but that is a necessary part of champion design. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e31OSVZF77w\n\nSince league is based on the principles of perfect imbalance, having champions that can do anything (generalists) are problematic, because they can use the tools that counter you but you don't have the tools to counter them. If every champion had tools to counter every other champion then the game gets stale, because every game becomes the same. Where does the variety in games come from?

I'm sure you didn't actually bother looking at the non examples, so i'll help you out with that:\n\n{{champion:80}} His abilities are set up to where you can only do 1 thing with it, he is a very black and white step 1 step 2 step 3 kinda champion. W E Q is really the only thing you can do with him in the way of a spell rotation without being useless\n\n{{champion:19}} Again absolutely nothing in his kit that provides options. Completely auto attack reliant when his ult is down, and when his ult is up all you do is lock-down 1 single target then go back to more auto attacking. Again, there is nothing in his kit to provoke anything but Ult slap slap slap.\n\n{{champion:12}} Same thing. Outside of his E Q, which have no diversity, he just Ults, runs around being a useless cow and occasionally heals stuff until his E Q comes back up. \n\n{{champion:254}} Although I really enjoy this champion, she is the exact same way. Sure your Q can take you all over, But either way as long as your ult is up you are going to end up in the ass of highest damage dealer on the team with a point and click ultimate that cannot be interupted. Then guess what's next? Punch punch punch punch!!!!\n\nDoes that make sense now? It's not a matter of just the champion having a tool for everything. Although that is the case, with the champions that have those tools it is very specific the effect. So for example:\n\n{{champion:412}} Disengage, engage, hard cc, peel, he's got it all. However he does not just have unlimited cooldowns and like 12 abilities where most champions have 4. He has 4 abilities that are either used 1 way or the other way, with no exceptions until they are back off cooldown.\n\n Examples of this are thresh cannot use his lantern to save someone then just leave it there for the next guy to grab when thresh engages. His lantern is down and it will be for another 22/20.5/19/17/16 seconds. Most fights are not long enough to use that ability twice anyway.\n\nIn fact all of his abilities are that way, E can be used to pull them towards you but not push away until it is up again. Q can be used to gap close but thresh doesn't magically get to change his mind and blink back to where he was like {{champion:7}} His ult is completely stationary, he doesn't get to keep moving it whenever he wants and it too has a cooldown.\n\nI can do this with a lot of champions but thresh just happens to be the subject of a lot of QQ these days, so I hope you understand what I was getting at\n\nEDIT: I missed something. With the simple champions there is never any room for decision making. Their mechanics are so basic that there was nothing better you could have done in the situation than you did assuming you used your basic step by step abilities. There is just no room to change the game when you are behind unless the enemy team does something completely retarded.","replies":[{"poster":"AMYS GRAVE","date":"2015-10-19T23:49:36.132+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm sorry that you cant see the decision making involved with \"simple\" champions though.

This is just like your Thresh example, there are god Leona's who know when and where to go in and bad Leona's who just spam the combo on the nearest thing. You can W+E+Q+R over and over again and be successful but there is more to it then that, you can use E on the front line to get to the back line, you can peel, you can use it to go over walls if you hit an enemy, you can use it to block skill shots, your stun can be offensive or defensive it can be used to cancel abilities or lock down the front line, etc. The same argument you used for Thresh can be used on most of those champions you said had boring kits, the only reason Thresh seems less boring is because his overloaded kit (im not saying he is OP but come on he can do pretty much everything a support needs to other then heal). Yes some champions are more straight forward in what they can do then others, but this is not bad champion design this is very good champion diversity, you need both hard and easy champions. CertainlyT is actually ruining this balance with their champions, because they are so far above those simple champs in overall power that they seem almost obsolete.  \n\nThe reason i bring this up because it doesn't really have anything to do with CertainlyT. You say boring kit, but isn't Darius' kit like this? I mean his combo rarely ever changes... the only thing that changes it is how far they are from him which is the same for all champions pretty much. I don't disagree with you overall though, CertainlyT is a great champion designer but he is incredibly bad at balancing his champions. This is more on the fact that they do not know how to properly implement some of his outside the box mechanics, so you can't really blame him that no one else is balancing his champions before putting them into the game. I mean he clearly does not know how to balance them, thats why they are so incredibly overpowered.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Boltrix","date":"2015-10-19T16:30:03.290+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll be upfront, I don't mind the CertainlyT rework innately, it tries to address problems of Mordekaiser that were namely toxic.

That aside, you said you liked champion kits that allowed diverse situations but dislike ekko? He has some of the most flexibility from a kit that I can think of. On top of that most of the kits you disliked are from early champions when the game first started so yes they are very basic. They are focused on doing one thing and doing it well. Have never nor will I ever knock anyone of the designers of the game. Mainly because they do it better than the vast majority of the community could.( talking 99.9% of us) That said I've noticed that newly released/reworked champions tend to come out strong and then toned back.
