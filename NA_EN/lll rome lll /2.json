I call serious bullshit on that, but it's enough of an excuse to get past any reports.\n\nWhy unfortunately? I play a good amount of Support, and hate when ADCs complain that they can't be on their own for 30 seconds. A couple games back I played Bard and was able to get multiple kills roaming mid, collect chimes, get dragon, etc. You shouldn't need a babysitter bottom, learn to play cautiously for a few seconds. This is especially true when I'm supporting a weak early game champion who is just farming, like Ez just hitting Qs on minions. You don't need me there all the time. You have a flash built into your kit.","replies":[{"poster":"BlackKnightJack","date":"2019-08-24T17:28:04.299+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's one thing when you decide to roam when the wave crashes into the enemy tower.

Top, Mid, Bot, Jungle. Support is the only one that's up to interpretation. In DOTA, the \"meta\" was 1-1-3 with two supports bottom (one of them supposed to be jungling, but sometimes it was just stacking and pulling waves, etc). Could also do 2-1-2 which is viable. No jungler. But with dragon, buffs, etc, Riot has made not jungling impossible.","replies":[]}]}]}
