If they’re not trying to win, then you can report them as such with a bite describing the behavior. \n\nOn another note, that’s not really off meta. Supports like Riven Lee Sin, Rammus, leBlanc, those would be off meta, IMO","replies":[{"poster":"LaneW123","date":"2019-08-24T07:49:47.845+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rammus sup sounds plausible. Would require good coordination with the ADC, but a knockup into a taunt is decent enough CC and the ult can secure an earlier tower to start roaming.\n\nToo bad I don't sup or I'd try to refine it. I played one game and it ended very badly.","replies":[{"poster":"GeminiRune","date":"2019-08-24T12:08:15.200+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Coming from a Support player in like every previous season, Rammus falls in what I call \"Ghost Supports\" - No zips, blinks, just I'm going in; stop me.
