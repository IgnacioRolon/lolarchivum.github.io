You literally took away half of akalis damage...... HALF! At lvl 18 akalis full combo ranges from 4500-5000 dmg and now it peaks at 2800. \n\nAkali.... one of the lowest win rate champions. Geeee wouldn't it be a splended idea to nerf the lowest win rate champion until shes no longer played? \n\nHOW ABOUT YOU JUST DO YOUR JOBS! If you cant make her balanced then revert her... simple (suck up your pride, and fix the damnn champ)","replies":[{"poster":"Its OK to Suck","date":"2019-05-31T06:54:56.517+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"I mean akali is completely busted even at this point so just relax about that.\n\nBut yes Riot is a bunch of incompetent people.

If you cant kill someone with all that you are mentally reta-rded. In fact the pros know this too, she is basically pickbanned at high elo, and pros. \n\nWinrate does not equal balance. I could have a champ that point and click 1100 range instakills someone with a 5 min cooldown. This champ has a 50% WR, so it's balanced right? Hell no. Akali is obnoxious cancer and to be honest is the next yasuo. That champion will never have a 50% wr because she would be the best champion in the entire game hands down.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bent Pixels","date":"2019-05-31T03:37:09.530+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":4,"body":"#WeWantARevert","replies":[{"poster":"Snowbrand","date":"2019-05-31T10:08:20.023+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Bent Pixels,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=AJ9JHI62,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2019-05-31T03:37:09.530+0000)\n>\n> #WeWantARevert\n\nNo","replies":[]}]}]}
