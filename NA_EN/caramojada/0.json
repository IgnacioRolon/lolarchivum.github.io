Go over that and test it in a custom game.

I had to replace my last one (Nvidia) due to it malfunctioning. When I disabled the Radeon, I was able to connect to the custom game I created, however the game ran at about 2 fps. As soon as the card is enabled again, I simply am unable to connect to any type of game.\n\nDo you think it is a faulty card? Should I go to the vendor and replace it?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-21T19:14:40.489+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the info!
