Last pure support champion was Bard if  i recall correctly (and that was a while ago), every other class is getting reworked or something for them and we got only 2 new items in the season 7. :( What are your thoughts about this topic guys?

Tank supports might be your only actual argument in this, i would agree most tank supports are far behind even with courage of colossus. aka braum as in it takes alot for him to get that off, along with being target practice for the ranged champions until your team decides to follow up.\n\nAs a support main, I would agree that tank supports have kinda been left behind. \n\nRiot finally found a fix to the problem of enchanters having little late game in their enchantments, because they couldn't afford AP. (A lot of options for that actually, some are on the side of OP) \n\nMage supports seem to be a fickle case, considering that what mainly allows them to work is how their kit works. Brand and Zyra, have enough CC to fill the support role, and get enough damage buying really cheap items. \n\nThe thing I see with tank supports is, their is about 3 kinds, wardens (Taric, Braum), pick supports (Blitz, threash), and vanguards (leona). A lot of players may not make such a distinction between tank supports, but I feel like it's enough that you wouldn't build each kind the same. \n\nSo Far Riot is kinda figuring out wardens with things like Knight's vow and Bond of Stone. And with the Exception of Leona, most Vanguards find their place out side the support role. \n\nPick supports like Thresh I think are a bit harder to support system wise, mainly because they are fairly item independent. (Being focused on individual picks, thresh isn't really going to tank because he's engaging, [vanguard] nor because he's soaking damage for his ally. [warden] So thresh doesn't really depend on tanky stats, it merely helps.)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Asayake 5150glow","date":"2016-12-30T23:38:38.445+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=A Bloo Banana,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=E2sFYpqd,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2016-12-30T23:01:57.717+0000)\n>\n> No, Depending on who you pick, Support is arguably one of the stronger roles at the moment.
