It happens quite often to some players. I think it has to do something with Braum. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFp35LSJajM","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-03-25T00:12:31.151+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"From the looks of this, there isn't a solid repro - would you have more information around it?

Generally from what I have seen, you open with ult and W and hit Braum AND allies with your ult (while Braum's shield is up), and then while your ult shield is up and your W is on cooldown (I would test it while you still have the W active buff as well) you Q and E Braum (who has his shield up) and your Q will go on a super long cooldown. The videos aren't clear, your Q MAY have to hit Braum and pierce through him to also hit his ally (if that's even possible?).\n\nThe bug has been around for months anyway. If Eve + Braum were high pick/ban in the LCS it would definitely happen in an LCS game and the game would need to be restarted.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-03-25T01:03:07.729+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahhh, thank you!
