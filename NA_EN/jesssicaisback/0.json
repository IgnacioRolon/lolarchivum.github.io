So naturally, I redownloaded it and enter the correct information to login. But once I clicked login it said I was banned. This happened to me on another game for the same reason but I sent out a report and eventually got unbanned. Can someone tell me what's going on or does it mean my account got disabled for not playing for a long time? :'(","replies":[{"poster":"Periscope","date":"2019-09-20T04:05:57.250+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's nothing much we can do from the boards.
