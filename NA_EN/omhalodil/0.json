Head over the [fantasy.lolesports.com](http://fantasy.lolesports.com) to create your league.\n~~Update 2: We're aware of a few issues that players are experiencing. Head over to the [known issues page](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/fantasy-lcs/FfuiWYMm-fantasy-lcs-known-issues) for more details.~~\n~~Update 3: **We've temporarily disabled drafts** to troubleshoot an issue where players are getting stuck in draft. Head over to the [known issues page](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/fantasy-lcs/FfuiWYMm-fantasy-lcs-known-issues) for more details and the latest updates.~~\n\nFantasy LCS is getting a face-lift for 2015, thanks to the feedback you gave us in the 2014 Beta. Here’s what’s new:\n\n* NA and EU are now on separate roster locks that correspond to the first day of matches for each league.\n* Each league now features a message board where you can coordinate draft times and discuss strategy.\n* We added chat functionality during draft\n* Scoring has been slightly tweaked: we added a fast win bonus of 2 points for teams that win in less than 30 minutes. Stay tuned for an article that dives into the rationale behind this scoring addition.\n* We added a few administrative tools:\n  * If you are a league creator, you can delete your league if you haven’t drafted yet.\n  * You can also leave a league if you haven’t drafted yet.\n  * You can now rename your team.\n* Your league home page, roster page, and match-ups page are now shareable publicly. Show off your dream team, those close wins, and your standings to your friends!\n\nNever played fantasy? Don't worry -- it's easy! Join together with up to seven friends or fellow League players, then build your dream team, one draft pick at a time. Every player from the NA and EU LCS is up for grabs, and what they do on the Rift each week matters. You're awarded points based on their performance, so when your pros do well, you do too! Fantasy LCS also adds a new layer of fun to watching matches each week, as fantasy stats updates will be piped in at real-time.\n\nWe've got a bunch of resources to help get you ready for your draft.

All you have to do is take in a player you don't want, and put the person you want to trade as a free agent. The other person takes in that player and puts the person you want as a free agent. You then give up that player your didn't want in the first place for the new one and voila, a trade. Unfortunately, anyone else on at the same time could theoretically steal anyone you put out this way. It really isn't a very good system. It worked for us because our league was all irl friends, but if that weren't the case, I don't know if I'd be willing to trade.","replies":[{"poster":"Gbuss","date":"2015-01-13T03:15:28.294+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The whole thing is that it relies on the honor system. IS there a way to trade players? Yes. Is there a way to safely trade players, with little to no possibility of someone else taking the person/team you are trading while you two are doing so? No. Also, in your example, what would stop the person that you are trading with from keeping the person you set as a free agent, and not giving up the trade that you wanted? There is only honor. I know it should be get better friends at that point, but if you set up a pool between co-workers, or flat mates, or whoever that you might not 100% trust, you need a specific system in place to trade.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"CLG Factor","date":"2015-01-12T20:13:38.760+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":3,"body":"So when does it go live for drafting and stuff?","replies":[{"poster":"Masalar","date":"2015-01-12T20:33:17.779+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":3,"body":"Well, I suppose you waited 6 minutes, so I guess that does qualify as staying tuned...","replies":[{"poster":"BADxW0LF","date":"2015-01-12T20:45:03.818+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":15,"body":"Lol.

The reason behind it is, yes, teams with longer games have more points, this isn't necessarily unfair. I believe this because now, time becomes just another factor, so IMO drafting isn't about kills/wins, however also about time, so it becomes an additional point in choosing a player/team, and I like that.\n\nSimilarly to the fact that you don't choose a football club just because they always win, however also because they score more goals relative to their position, I think that time should change the drafting a bit.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Samar Shrestha","date":"2015-05-16T16:34:24.361+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Someone invite me in their league please.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Megakil96","date":"2015-04-21T17:10:01.151+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can't find the link to start a league.
