All of my first games of the day were perfect and did not lag or spike. If i play another game, the next game would lag like crazy. I went from having 50 ms in my first game to 500 ms in my second game. Seriously, all of my first games are fine, but the second games or thirds games lag. The pattern repeats over and over each day, and I am getting tired of it. Anyone know what wrong? Internet, Computer, Client, etc?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-15T18:37:10.998+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Inconsistencies in latency (ping) are usually caused by routing issues to the server or by network settings that don't provide a stable connection to the League servers.
