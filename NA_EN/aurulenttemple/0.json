It's my first time making a discussion. ( Or a complaint. )\nI'm having problems with the Chest Opening system, if this is a bug or it is something I am not aware of.\n\nhttps://gyazo.com/ee321f32ff3b4d4dfa7b248c0f0a04ba\n\nIt says I currently have 4 Chests available, when hovering above the chest icon.\nI know for a fact all those four are Hextech Chests.\nHowever if I go try to open the chests in my loot tab, this appears, having 0 chests?\n\nhttps://gyazo.com/4047009ab984c8e0d9e061426c7cb962\n\nI've been searching ways to solve this, unfortunately I haven't got a chance managing to find the exact problem.\n\nEither it's a bug, or is it something I should be concern of?\n\nThank you in advance.

After you earn a chest then you will see it appear in your loot page.","replies":[{"poster":"AurulentTemple","date":"2017-08-03T08:08:20.194+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-04T00:40:36.429+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lew on point with the assist! He's spot on, and you'll be able to get those chests by having yourself or a premade earn an S- or above while using a champion you own. Those available chest slots will \"regenerate\" one by one starting 7 days from when you earned the first one!","replies":[]}]}]}]}
