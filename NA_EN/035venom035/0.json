It always gets to 2% done. I restarted the client a couple times(someone has solved that issue that way), I reinstalled it a couple time. Is there any other way to download LoL like a zip file(the entire game), I really wanna play. I tried everything that I found on the internet, even used to Hextech Repair Tool, but no help.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-25T01:42:43.921+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let's try a couple different things really quickly.\n\nFirst off, let's adjust a couple network settings that might be getting in the way. Adjust your Port Forwarding and DNS settings by following the steps outlined in our [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues). This should be able to get you a clearer connection to our servers specifically.\n\nSecond, double check your OS's admin settings following the [**permissions guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions). The installer could be slowing down because it doesn't have access to the files it's trying to update.\n\nLet me know if this doesn't help at all and we can dig a little deeper.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Promisering","date":"2017-10-25T00:29:05.186+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am also having this same issue.  It's actually pathetic.  I've downloaded several other programs (davinci resolve, several adobe programs, ffxiv, about 500gb worth of other programs) as I just reformatted my computer.  I've gotten all of these programs in the 6 hours it's taken league to get to 56%.... \n\nAlso my support ticket seemed to be of little help.  <3  I'm about to download dota2 and watch it be done before league gets to 60%.","replies":[]}]}
