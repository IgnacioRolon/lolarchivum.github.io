I now have 2 matches where (according to match history and item purchases) I am the only one who disconnected. I had already agreed to leave buster on the first (black screen on loading screen). I got disconnected from the chat mid champ select on the second game, and I haven't been able to log back in since.\n\nI do not know how I am the only one who got disconnected from those games, but considering the growing cries for help of other people who now can't log in, I know that the disconnects were not anything related to my system. I went to the support page and there is a message up stating they are investigating these, so I didn't post a ticket.\n\nHowever, I am wondering if I will have penalties removed from those two games? I have not disconnected from any game since the creation of this account. I'm sure someone from Riot can verify that.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-17T23:25:13.579+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There currently aren't any server issues on NA.  The black screen you're seeing is usually due to a connection issue that's unable to download assets and connect to the game server.  I suggest going over our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to strengthen your connect and maintain a stable connection while in-game.  It's important you get this fixed up to prevent further leaverbuster escalations!  The only way to return to good standing is by playing without interruptions.

I even just sat through a full 30 minute screen-sharing call on Skype with not so much as a hiccup. I am finally logged back in now and I'm about to try again.\n\nServer issues or not, there were others complaining about not being able to log in and being kicked from the chat client (which is what kicked me from the second champ select). I was also completely unable to spectate a friends game between these matches, but I didn't think it was related at the time. I just didn't do anything when I clicked \"Spectate\".","replies":[]}]}]}
