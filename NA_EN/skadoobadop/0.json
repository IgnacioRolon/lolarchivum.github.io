And even if you should give up, it shouldn't be pre-15 minutes. Many champions don't get anywhere near their powerspikes in 15 minutes. You wanna make the game even snowballier and hell for everyone? We should be encouraging people to stick it out rather than surrender every fucking game before it's even over.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TranscendVirtual","date":"2018-04-08T22:27:29.779+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Th1sIsASmurfLMAO,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=vKdWjiex,comment-id=00060000,timestamp=2018-04-07T06:07:55.866+0000)\n>\n> you are literally part of the reason the game is dying.

No, im just sick of every game 2 or more people begging for a ff 5 minutes in, no im not ruining this game, people having no willingness to try to come back is ruining it.
