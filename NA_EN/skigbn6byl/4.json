I used to flame long time ago when I was silver and I deserved a chat restriction back then, but not for 2200 games. Extreme cases of flaming get so many chat restrictions, but I was saying stuff like \"stop feeding idiots\" or maybe \"r%%%%%s\", but that was 1300+ games ago. I stopped flaming but I kept getting new sets of chat restrictions, even without any warnings. (i got 2 warnings in my last chat restriction of 700 games, and Riot can check chat logs from both of these games, its just four silver premades raging at me for being forced to play ahri supp because \"yasuo said mid first on skype\" 30 seconds after I locked in. The other warning was completely undeserved, I said \"wtf i just got a warning\" and my team mates said \"but you weren't even flaming\". I just want to see my chat logs which deserve so many chat restrictions. I already submitted a request to Riot support 3 days ago and still no answers (just some random copy+pasted message which is completely irrelevant to my question)...","replies":[]}
