The way you describe them, you make the players who haven't searched on it think that abilities will also scale with AS items, something that is obviously not the case.\r\n\r\nSo, items and abilities should show exactly how much AS a champion will gain, it's only logical when you call yourself advocates of \"in-game clarity\". Additionally, having the AS gains listed as percentages imposes a \"burden of knowledge\" on how the AS calculations work behind the final numbers and that's also something else you have claimed to be against.","replies":[{"poster":"Phreak","date":"2014-08-16T22:38:59.835+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":4,"body":"Rabadon's does list the bonus AP on the tooltip.\n\nI'm actually surprised that Attack Speed scaling is confusing for some players.

This is an important difference. (althought they are the same)\nFor example: \n{{item:1042}} on {{champion:119}} gives **0.10185** attacks per second. This is nowhere near useful for anything. \n\nIt would look completely different if the result would result in this:\n{{item:1042}} on {{champion:119}} reduces the cooldown of auto-attacks by **0.192 seconds per attack**\n\nThe player can grasp the *reduced cooldown per attack* much more easily than the *attacks per second*.

It is true (obviously) that Attack Speed and Crit Chance are both presented as percentages. But that doesn't mean they're exactly the same sort of entity. The difference is that Crit *Chance* is just that--a *probability* to deal extra damage--whereas Attack Speed is a *multiplier* that applies to a property of every autoattack. They're two different types of statistic that just happen to be both expressed as percentages.\n\nSince you like looking at things mathematically, I'll try to describe what I think you see. Both stats appear in a formula for *time-averaged* damage as multipliers of the form (1 + TotalStatMod), ignoring crit damage modifiers for simplicity. But they only look similar mathematically when you do the time-average (uh, I guess we call that DPS :P). Otherwise, they are intuitively slightly different (which I've tried to explain in English in the first paragraph). In other words, when you say \"I'm actually surprised\" and explain why, I think you've missed something that's part of others' intuition.\n\nAll that said, I personally think the way Attack Speed boosts are presented is fine as it is, especially since you can mouse over your Attack Speed at any time to see the base you're working from, if you want to compare it to other characters'. Maybe in tutorials or something you could make it clear that different champions have different base Attack Speed?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Old Man Teeto","date":"2014-08-16T23:41:44.491+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Attack Speed isn't confusing.\n\nIt never has been confusing.
