You can do damage yes. But even if they all stacked the hell out of armour you'd be doing far, far, far more with ADC Ashe especially with the current state of pen vs armour.\n\nIn the vast majority of games I'd rather have no AP than no ADC, even if that meant going ADC Ahri or something because nobody picked an ADC, because you simply lose less out of it. Barring some niche tankbuster cases like Malzahar, you NEED an ADC to take out bruisers effectively, whereas if you have no burst AP all it means is you have to be a little more careful around their squishies.","replies":[{"poster":"aaronconlin","date":"2015-01-19T00:21:12.580+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe, I didn't say I picked it because I wanted to be more effective.

Volley has a very small cost for what it does. It only cost 60 mana and easily is spammable. Frist shot is easily the biggest mana sink at 8 mana per attack then enchanted crystal arrow at 100 mana. However ashe's mana pool is quite large at most points in the game. Scaling up to 827 at lvl 18 with no items.

It ended up being mostly a high ranked build for her besides 2 items that I swapped out because I added like an attack speed item to her or something. And then this person on the team kept telling me I wasn't building enough attack speed on her and kept telling me I was bad. I didn't have time to go check builds for her so I was like \"I mean, she has attack speed as her passive on her ult so I think I probably have a decent amount, but alright I'll add some more\". \nAnd I actually did well in the match, but of course this person (who eventually told us he was a little kid and laughed because he was \"doing better than us old people\") kept trash talking me and my friends all game and using hate speech and whatnot (I like to think he got banned in the end) and upon looking at all the high-ranking builds for Rek I discovered that like hardly any of the \"high ranking builds\" for her have a lot of attack speed items, and I actually had built 4/6 items for one of the top rated builds for her. \n\nSo sometimes someone telling you that your build sucks doesn't mean anything. A lot of times they may just flat out not actually know how that champ works.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Raxicor","date":"2015-01-18T19:19:17.080+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, a lot of people are afraid of trying new things.
