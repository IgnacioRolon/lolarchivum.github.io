But I come across way too many people who &quot;don&#039;t believe in tilting&quot;.\r\n\r\nTilting is real. If someone went up to you in real life, commented on how ugly you are, punched you, and then walked away, I guarantee you would have some emotional reaction to it. It&#039;s the same in League. Calling your teammates &quot;shit&quot;, pointing out their mistakes, and flaming about an AFK teammate DOES severely affect your gameplay. Denying the existence of tilting is denying that your words have any emotional impact on others. (Which, in my opinion, is just an excuse to bully people for your own insecurities)\r\n\r\nTilting is when a player takes on an aggressive laning position, makes irrational decisions, and takes unnecessary risks. They often &quot;all or nothing&quot; against an enemy, dive into a 1v5 or 3v5, lose focus of objectives, and facecheck the brush. Tilting can be caused by one&#039;s own opinions of their gameplay or skills, an ally&#039;s negative comments, or a feeling of hopelessness caused by an AFK teammate.\r\n\r\nHow to avoid it:\r\n\r\n* People recognize when they make a mistake. The majority of people are way too hard on themselves when they do mess up. As a teammate, instead of making a negative comment or telling them to &quot;play defensively&quot;, make a positive comment about something they are doing well at in lane, or as a jungler you can let them know you&#039;ll gank soon.\r\n* If a teammate is feeding, it is extremely important to react before the enemy laner snowballs. Most of the time I will see a player feed 2-3 kills before a teammate comes to help them, and it&#039;s often too late. Instead, pay extra attention to their lane and take advantage of teleport and other mobility spells to catch out the enemy, even if they only have a kill or two. When I&#039;m spectating and someone loses lane, it&#039;s partially their fault, but also partially the teams fault for not responding. (Never, ever say this in team chat as it can lead to flaming.)\r\n* &quot;gj&quot; &quot;nj&quot; &quot;np&quot; &quot;ty&quot; &quot;going b&quot; &quot;you&#039;re doing great&quot; &quot;dont worry about it&quot; &quot;just keep it up, you outscale ___&quot; &quot;we have this late game&quot; &quot;lets focus on objectives and towers&quot; &quot;lets try pushing up a lane&quot; &quot;care&quot; - These are all great things to say in game. League is a game entirely dependent upon communication. Positive communication will reduce tilting &amp; increase team&#039;s morale. Securing objectives is another great way to get off tilt.\r\n* If you lose the game because a teammate fed (Look at me, I went on a 6 game losing streak despite going ~24-4 every game because teammates fed) do NOT flame them. Not only will it surely affect their next game performance, but it&#039;ll also affect your own. Being a dick puts you on tilt too.\r\n* Watch replays of your past games. It&#039;s impossible to criticize your own mistakes while you play. Knowing that you have it recorded (ehem, LoLReplay) lets you move on in the game and stop perseverating about it.\r\n* Don&#039;t surrender. Don&#039;t view it even as a possibility. If you&#039;re worried about the number of games you&#039;re playing and not the QUALITY of the games you play, then you aren&#039;t going to follow the next recommendation and are surely going to be on tilt.\r\n* Take breaks. Whether I feel like I&#039;m on tilt or not, every single game I win or lose, I take a 5 minute break. (Not timed, I just get up and eat something, play with my dogs, etc) This helps you decompress after your last game, process what happened in it, and prepare for the next one. (Why do you think LCS teams take breaks between games?) League is an extremely mentally demanding game, breaks are healthy. I just took the ACT yesterday, and the intermittent breaks between test sections was amazing. I got to disconnect and think about how I did from an outside perspective, assess what I should&#039;ve done better (such as pacing myself differently), before resuming my next test. Every League game is a test, don&#039;t just surrender half way through with an &quot;I can&#039;t do it!&quot;. Even finishing the test will get you a ~50%, giving up gives you a 0%.\r\n\r\nFor those of you out there who still don&#039;t believe tilting is real, I would recommend:\r\n1. Getting examined by a therapist, maybe you have an emotion disorder\r\n2. Going into a local gym and calling a body builder a wimp. I guarantee you&#039;ll get a reaction. (And maybe a black eye)\r\n\r\nTL;DR Just because people are online doesn&#039;t mean they don&#039;t have feelings. Don&#039;t be a dick.","replies":[{"poster":"Only Play Darius","date":"2015-04-30T04:30:35.813+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Once had a game where {{champion:150}} lost lane hard to {{champion:92}} and really felt bad about it once she started roaming to other lanes, saying he fu*cked up and what not.

We managed to swing the gold advantage back into our favor and proceeded to win the game.

There are some situations you absolutely CANNOT win where the surrender button is a blessing. e.g.: Intentional feeders, down 4 towers by 15 minutes (Not always a loss, but pretty much is in most cases), duo queue bot lane that's 0/25 by 10 minutes (somehow, they always manage do this), and 2+ DC's.\n\nStill love this post, though.","replies":[{"poster":"Mikal Pikal","date":"2015-04-30T20:33:41.500+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"While true, people give up and surrender way too early.

It kinda solidifies a loss when a teammate goes \"GG, we lose, retarded team\" every 30 seconds and does /ff whenever possible. HOWEVER, there's no harm in surrendering a faceroll game because it's pretty much a loss anyway.\n\nFor example, say you have a late-game-heavy team and the enemy team is mid-game-heavy. They 12-3 your team by 15 minutes, have every dragon so far (probably 2, factoring in Bronze), have all your T1s down, and most of your T2s down. /ff in a situation like this is completely reasonable, because you're SO far behind in objectives and gold that it's hard to recover, even when you hit your late-game spike.","replies":[{"poster":"Offended","date":"2015-05-01T20:38:01.766+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree that the odds might be immensely stacked against you, impossibly so, and there is almost no chance of a comeback.
