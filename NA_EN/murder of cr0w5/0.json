No matter what the situation instead of a loading screen I just get an empty black screen for about 4 minutes then my game crashes.  I have tried every single fix under the sun, so now I'm posting this here hoping someone has come up with something I haven't tried yet to fix this problem that Riot really should have ironed out in the Client Beta.\r\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}}","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-06-20T17:48:38.944+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unless you're getting a bugsplat, this black screen usually indicates a connection failure from your network to the game server.  It's unable to download any assets so it stays black until leaving you behind entirely.  The game itself is independent of the client, so it wouldn't impact that.  \n\nMy recommendation would be to go over each step of the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to troubleshoot.  While I know you said you've tried every fix under the sun, I don't really know what that means but hopefully that guide does the trick.  Let me know if you run into any issues.","replies":[]}]}
