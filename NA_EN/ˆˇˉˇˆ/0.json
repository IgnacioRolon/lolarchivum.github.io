I got banned right after Game 1.

We also played two other games together after that one. The Graves however, was not with us, and he probably reported me.*\n\nHi guys,\n\nI&#039;ve just been banned from a heated game that... didn&#039;t actually even matter. A pre-made screwed me over by not banning 2 slots, flamed me pre-, in- and post-game throughout the whole game, and I got upset and typed too much..\nKinda sad caused first time I ever made Gold, but oh well, at least want to tell others to make myself feel less bad... \n\nI have screenshots of pre- and post-game lobby if you&#039;re interested in what team &quot;mates&quot; said.\n\nAlso, at some points when I say stuff like &quot;what a legend,&quot; it was in response to his mocking (Brand: 60 CS at 15 minutes, what a legend), not that toxic on my own. I&#039;m still guilty though, evidently.\n\nThe Brand also added me afterwards to try to trash talk me, and right then I got a notification that I got banned, and he messaged me some rude stuff and unadded me...\n\nAnyway, here are my chat logs:\n\nGame 1\nPre-Game\n&circ;ˇˉˇ&circ;: WTF\n&circ;ˇˉˇ&circ;: Why did yoiu ban Nothing????\n&circ;ˇˉˇ&circ;: You coulda banned Yasuo!\n&circ;ˇˉˇ&circ;: ...what the fuck\n&circ;ˇˉˇ&circ;: Yes?\n&circ;ˇˉˇ&circ;: No\n&circ;ˇˉˇ&circ;: Not scared, frustrated\n&circ;ˇˉˇ&circ;: I Hate playing against Yasuo, Lucian, Brand, and Jhin\n&circ;ˇˉˇ&circ;: ?\n&circ;ˇˉˇ&circ;: I&#039;m not saying I will lose, I&#039;m saying I don&#039;t have FUN playing against those\nIn-Game\n&circ;ˇˉˇ&circ;: What\n&circ;ˇˉˇ&circ;: Stop\n&circ;ˇˉˇ&circ;: Please\n&circ;ˇˉˇ&circ;: lag btw\n&circ;ˇˉˇ&circ;: Brand wtf man\n&circ;ˇˉˇ&circ;: I literally saw you walk towards bot so I start engaging cause I think IOm safe since youre coming\n&circ;ˇˉˇ&circ;: And you walk BACK into their jungle????\n&circ;ˇˉˇ&circ;: They&#039;re tucking killing us\n&circ;ˇˉˇ&circ;: AND they got Drake\n&circ;ˇˉˇ&circ;: I literally piinged drake\n&circ;ˇˉˇ&circ;: Then COME with me\n&circ;ˇˉˇ&circ;: You leave for no reason\n&circ;ˇˉˇ&circ;: Brand roams when I think he will engage\n&circ;ˇˉˇ&circ;: And I die\n&circ;ˇˉˇ&circ;: Without even PINGING where he&#039;s going\n&circ;ˇˉˇ&circ;: ?\n&circ;ˇˉˇ&circ;: Literally what else am I supposed to do\n&circ;ˇˉˇ&circ;: Cant even stay under tower\n&circ;ˇˉˇ&circ;: Cause Ali WQ combos me and Lucian has Bork\n&circ;ˇˉˇ&circ;: At least grant us a gank please\n&circ;ˇˉˇ&circ;: Since Brand doesnt help at all\n&circ;ˇˉˇ&circ;: Lucian will carry them guys\n&circ;ˇˉˇ&circ;: If you dont help bot soon\n&circ;ˇˉˇ&circ;: Olaf\n&circ;ˇˉˇ&circ;: Wanna switch lanes\n&circ;ˇˉˇ&circ;: Thanks\n&circ;ˇˉˇ&circ;: Brand is roaming 24/7 and blames me for dying in lane\n&circ;ˇˉˇ&circ;: Thanks team, didnt I say Lucian is fed?\n&circ;ˇˉˇ&circ;: But yes, keep blaming me instead of helping me like I ask the whole game, that&#039;ll help\n&circ;ˇˉˇ&circ;: aka VAYNE and BRAND\n&circ;ˇˉˇ&circ;: Zero lane presence at 15 minutes\n&circ;ˇˉˇ&circ;: What a legend\n&circ;ˇˉˇ&circ;: Zero support role presence at 15 minutes\n&circ;ˇˉˇ&circ;: How do you do it?\n&circ;ˇˉˇ&circ;: Then tell your duo Brand to stop talking\n&circ;ˇˉˇ&circ;: Nice toxic question mark ping, Brand\n&circ;ˇˉˇ&circ;: That&#039;ll SURE help us win!!!!\n&circ;ˇˉˇ&circ;: True\n&circ;ˇˉˇ&circ;: why say no\n&circ;ˇˉˇ&circ;: See, Brand always walks away then flames me for my low CS\n&circ;ˇˉˇ&circ;: Are you flaming me Olaf\n&circ;ˇˉˇ&circ;: Why\n&circ;ˇˉˇ&circ;: How would I do any damage with my current items\n&circ;ˇˉˇ&circ;: Youre 1/5, even worse than we\n&circ;ˇˉˇ&circ;: *me\n&circ;ˇˉˇ&circ;: Farmed?
