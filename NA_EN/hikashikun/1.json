Name&#039;s Hikashikun, a Teemo main all the way from Season 2 and I&#039;m here to explain to you nice folks why these new patch 5.15 changes are a nerf to Teemo overall gameplay and potential but before that, here&#039;s a little background info on who I am and why I have some authority over the subject on Teemo. \n\n**Achievements**\n\n* Season 2: Gold (Teemo Anywhere)\n\n* Season 3: Diamond I (80% Teemo Top, 20% Teemo Jungle)\n\n* Season 4: Masters (90% Teemo Jungle, 10% Teemo Elsewhere)\n\n* Season 5: Diamond II on HIKASHIKUN & HIKASHLKUN (90% Teemo Jungle, 10% Teemo Elsewhere) \n\n**Teemo Guides**\n\n* 536,000 Views - http://www.mobafire.com/league-of-legends/build/masters-diamond-1-teemo-jungle-hikashikun-354813\n\n* 11,200 Views - http://www.lolking.net/guides/353605\n\n**Na.Op.GG**\n\n* http://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=Hikashikun\n* http://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=HLKASHLKUN\n\n**Patch 5.15 Nerfs**\n\n1. (R) Noxious Trap duration reduced to 5 minutes from 10 minutes.\n2. (R) Noxious Trap takes 1.5 seconds to arm from 1.0 seconds. \n3. (Q) Blinding Dart doesn&#039;t always work on the first auto as it used to anymore. *This could be an unintentional bug\n\n**Patch 5.15 Buffs**\n\n1.  Passive (Camouflage): Scaling Attack Speed bonus, 1.5 seconds to stealth from 2.0 seconds, 0.75 seconds to stealth while in brush, and moving inside brush while Camouflaged no longer breaks stealth.\n2. You can now toss (R) Noxious Trap. The range scales with rank and can bounce off each other. \n\n**Teemo&#039;s Usual Gameplay**\n\n1.  Use (R) Noxious Trap to protect objectives such as Baron and Dragon.\n2.  Chain (R) Noxious Trap in rows to develop a connected array of vision pockets. \n3.  Place (R) Noxious down in lane to prevent buildup of minions from pushing to your tower(s). \n4. Place mushrooms right before enemy split pushers who are unaware of both you and your ultimate. When (R) Noxious Trap activates upon enemy champion, emerge from Passive Camouflage and attack - \"Enemy has been slain\".\n5. When close enough to walls, you can place your (R) Noxious Trap over these obstacles (Baron pit, Dragon pit, Base walls, etc). \n\n**Teemo&#039;s Intended Patch 5.15 Gameplay**\n\n1.  Hold onto 3 stacks of (R) Noxious Trap to later throw at enemies in team fights. Note, when thrown the ultimate does not immediately go off as it takes 1.5 seconds to activate when on the ground.\n2. Throw mushrooms into Baron and Dragon pits.\n3. Sit in brush and ambush enemies or evade ganks with the new passive. \n\n**The Problem**\n\n1.  Team fights don&#039;t happen in just one spot, it&#039;s volatile, always changing depending on the situation. Throwing the mushrooms into enemies doesn&#039;t seem as viable as it sounds when it takes an extra 1.5 seconds to even do anything. They could either (A) Run Away within the 1.5 seconds, (B) Destroy the mushroom before it activates, (C) Drop Pink Wards to help identify and eliminate them, or (D) Let lane minions activate them. \n2. While Teemo is too busy throwing his (R) Noxious Trap, couldn&#039;t he be doing more for his team by attacking the enemies during all this time instead of waiting for the ultimate to work?\n3. It&#039;s such a terrible idea to hold onto three stacks of (R) Noxious Trap when you can prepare them before major fights in desired spots while armed and ready, while developing more mushrooms over time. Overall, these new changes are significantly reducing the amount of (R) Noxious Traps on the ground while removing one of Teemo&#039;s main contributions to his team; **vision control.** Someone once said,\"What&#039;s the point of mushrooms if they don&#039;t even hit anyone?\". Well the counter argument to that comment is that despite (R) Noxious Trap not activating, they still serve their purpose for vision, alerting the team where enemies are most likely to be and where they are not, saving resources such as Wards, Gold, and Time. \n4. How often do you actually utilize the brush for anything? Why would I be wasting time sitting (or moving) in a brush when I can be out there with my team, getting kills and objectives? \n\n**Seriously**\n\n1. If these changes were made to be buffs as Riot made them to be, why would we Teemo mains be complaining and generating as much attention as possible? Why not just keep silent and abuse these _\"buffs\"_ ?\n2. You just cut Teemo&#039;s ultimate duration in HALF. How many (R) Noxious Traps do you are now available to support Teemo&#039;s Gameplay to be healthy or even viable?\n3. What different type of gameplay are you trying to make all of us Teemo mains out there learn? \n4. I have yet to come across any Teemo mains who agrees that these changes are indeed buffs. If anything, they&#039;re gimmicky. Yes, sorry but to the tune of easily over 2,000 Teemo games across all of my accounts in both ranked and normals, these changes are gimmicks.","replies":[{"poster":"Prospector Pete","date":"2015-08-09T20:13:02.067+0000","up_votes":46,"down_votes":3,"body":"Tossing mushrooms is cool, but I don't want it if it causes his mushrooms to last half as long.","replies":[{"poster":"HIKASHIKUN","date":"2015-08-09T20:24:43.146+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":2,"body":"This is literally what I've been saying to myself everyday since the patch so far.","replies":[{"poster":"MaIÃ¯k","date":"2015-08-14T10:11:48.595+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't even need the passive buff and the bouncing thingy... at least **put the mushrooms duration scalling like (5/7,5/10 mins)** and please **put back the arm time to 1 sec.\n**\nAnd by the way **fix that blind bugg**","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Peel Your ADC","date":"2015-08-09T20:04:11.120+0000","up_votes":49,"down_votes":9,"body":"At least he wasn't {{champion:114}}","replies":[{"poster":"HIKASHIKUN","date":"2015-08-09T20:17:41.247+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":5,"body":"Relevant username and comment.

What is more toxic about Teemo's kit than Nidalee, Soraka, or any other champion people find frustrating to play against? Every champion is going to have something that other players find annoying. That's the nature of a competitive game. Teemo had a fair win rate before the most recent patch (it's dropped 6% since then). He wasn't dominating solo queue, but he still carved out a decent niche for players like myself who enjoy playing him.","replies":[{"poster":"MadDoughnutz","date":"2015-08-10T04:05:31.437+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"'Toxic' in Riotspeak generally means champions or abilities that have low interaction; Namely, Point and click abilities, Press one button for free steroid with nothing else, and so on and so forth.\n\nSo, according to Riot, {{champion:39}} , {{champion:8}} , {{champion:17}},  {{champion:78}} , {{champion:19}} . {{champion:45}} (Old Veigar, not new), {{champion:1}}  are all champions with toxic kits, because of low interaction abilities that don't really give any meaningful or fun counterplay, mainly through mechanical skill.

Every champion will have their standard issue dash, steroid, % damage and execute?  Down that road lies mediocrity for everyone but the top picks with the overloaded kits.  I don't like WW, but he's popular because he can lock down hypermobile champs that are otherwise near-impossible to catch or hit with skillshots.  You know skillshots?  Those fair mechanics with plenty of counterplay? \n\nIt seems like riot is obsessed that every champion's enemies have \"counterplay\", a buzzword they made up.  But that is WHY champions like the ones mentioned above are strong.  They've given new champions more and more ways to counter older ones.  Hypermobile carries like {{champion:429}}  and {{champion:157}}  dodge every skillshot you throw at them.  Heck, {{champion:157}}  has more ways to counter the enemy built into his kit than ways to affect them.  His dash counters skillshots and slows, his wall counters nearly everything that isn't a melee attack and his shield counters poke by giving him extra health.  How is that not \"poor counterplay\"?  He gets free health and free crit WITHOUT even having to push a button.  I guess he's fair because his ult only works if you're knocked up... something more and more and more champions in the game have. Several of them on point and click abilities.\n\nPoint and click abilities are NOT toxic to the game if the game is balanced around them.  Point and click abilities should be weaker than skillshots because there is no risk in them.  Short ranged abilities can afford to be stronger since the risk involved in them is having to get that close to longer-ranged skillshot champs.  Mobile champions should not really have point-and-click abilities unless those abilties are very weak, since that lowers the risk and difficulty of getting in close to your target.  For instance, I would say {{champion:254}}  has a poor set up, balance wise.  She has a dash and a targeted lockdown ability and she does very good damage with her ult and in general.  She tank- shreds pretty well, she bursts very well, she can get very tanky, and she can't be evaded once she's pressed R.  Being able handle and do nearly everything doesn't make her balanced, it makes her overtuned, where now there is very little counterplay AGAINST her.  \n\n{{champion:1}}  however, is NOT unbalanced.  Oh sure, she's annoying.  If you're not playing a long-ranged midlaner you're gonna have a hard time.  But she is picked because she's got no risk of failure in her skills... something that is becoming more and more needed with each new hyper mobile champ released onto the rift.  People not long ago were complaining about \"mobility creep\" and how poorly it was affecting the game.  Well, champions like {{champion:1}}  are the answer... and now people want them nerfed because she prevents zed from 100-0'ing her under tower and pressing R again to fly back to safety?  {{champion:1}}  is NOT that hard to deal with.  Play passively unless you outrange her, and have someone tanky who can initiate onto her and eat her stun.  If you go at her with 5 squishy champs that will die instantly to Tibbers, you deserve what you get.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kuroi86","date":"2015-08-10T11:31:23.827+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"A combination of a blind and a heavy Dot means laning against him is aggravating, his ult means that after a certain point you're simply going to keep on running into shrooms.

A slightly bonus on the attack speed after you break out of stealth: When do you utilize this spell? Ohh yeah, right, mostly during the laning phase (from lvl 1 to 11-13). Basically this is a pointless change (on my eyes a minor nerf).\n(Old lvl 1 attack speed bonus: +40% ; New lvl 1 attack speed bonus: +20%), (Old lvl 5 attack speed bonus: +40%; New lvl 5 attack speed bonus: +40%) and (Old lvl 10 attack speed bonus: +40% ; New lvl 10 attack speed bonus: +60%).\n. A nice Camuflage buff was the time that you need to wait until you get stealthed\n( - 0,5 secs out of a bush; - 1,25 secs in a bush).\n. A kinda of a overpowered buff was that now you can move inside of a bush with out breaking the stealth that your passive provides, that was not needed.\n. Tossing out your mushrooms its a quite big buff since now you don't need to face check to place down your mushrooms.\n\nNow lets see the nerfs:\n. The time reduction of the mushrooms its insane. You basically are cutting down **HALF** of the time.\n. It seems pointless on paper but during the game an extra 0,5 secs matter alot...\n\n**My suggestions on how to make this changes look better:**\nPassive:\n- Time needed in order to get stealth while standing still: 2 -> 1,5 secs\n . If in a bush you only need 0,75 sec to activate Camuflage.\n- You gain a slightly increased bonus of attack speed after breaking passive's stealth (by moving or attacking).\n- You can no longer move inside of the bush with out breaking the stealth off.\n\nUltimate (R):\n- You Toss a mushroom at the target location (300/600/900).\n- Your mushrooms have a duration of (5/7,5/10)mins.\n- Your mushrooms takes 1 sec to get armed.\n- Your mushrooms can no longer bounce on top of the other ones.\n\nPs: If you can like this changes put a like so Riot guys can see this. {{champion:17}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Slaxer","date":"2015-08-10T01:33:39.856+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's a nerf, but I am still gonna main Teemo because he is still my favorite champion.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CasterGilgamesh","date":"2015-08-10T01:15:02.864+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol the hate on teemo like riven is getting pretty old i never truly saw a reason to nerf him they could have just reduced his blind duration at lower levels but increase it at higher levels teemo almost completely doesn't matter in a team fight riot needs to revert the nerfs on his shrooms and just shift it to the rest his kit his whole thing was to be a shrom placer that's why he has **no** team fight he gave up his ult for map control he **needs** those shrooms to be strong ","replies":[]},{"poster":"ManiacalCoin","date":"2015-08-09T22:38:55.434+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im another Teemo main and this is a nerf to everything\n.\n.\n.\n.\nbut trolling","replies":[]},{"poster":"THEMIGHTYPANDA","date":"2015-08-21T22:46:29.745+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I main teemo a lot and now that my shrooms last half as long its harder for me to set traps for team fights because in the time it takes me to get 8 shrooms out for traps most of them are almost out of time when i used to be able to set a 15-20 shroom traps","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sasogwa","date":"2015-08-10T13:38:57.892+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't understand why once again Riot feels the need for 'compensation' and divides the duration of shrooms by 2.\nNO... just... no...","replies":[]},{"poster":"daggers of denak","date":"2015-08-10T13:05:49.723+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"This patch nerfed probably his biggest contribution to the team, his shrooms, controlling the map with his shrooms should be his niche as he isn't that strong in any other area.

Looking at how people talk and react about Teemo, you would think he's this incredibly overpowered hypercarry that you can't counter in any way. That includes the way Riot has been treating him. Nerf after nerf and without redistributing the power anywhere. The one buff he had gotten was making Toxic Shot slightly stronger. He's just been getting flat nerfs until this last change which isn't a flat numbers nerf but STILL an effective nerf, with an absurdly bad redistribution of power (new passive, new gimmick). \n\nMost recent nerfs:\n\"Noxious Trap: ABILITY POWER RATIO: 0.8 â 0.5\"\n\"Toxic Shot: Ability Power ratio on impact reduced to 0.3 from 0.4\"\n\"Noxious Trap: Damage reduced at later ranks to 200/325/450 from 200/400/600\"\n\nThat is a HUGE amount of power taken right out of the champion. And that wasn't even the first time Mushrooms got nerfed.\n\n2011:\"Noxious Trap: Mushroom reload time increased to 35/31/27 from 30/26/22\n Damage reduced to 200/400/600 from 250/475/700\"\n\nYou see this and it makes it seem like Teemo was putting entire teams on his back and effortlessly winning games with no way to stop him.\nI love playing as Teemo, but I've also fought him many times over the years and never failed to shut him down. \nThere are so many ways to deal with him: Magic Resist. Heals. Sweepers. Pink wards. Banshee's Veil. Repeat ganks (1 pink ward can negate his minefield in top lane, and he's ridiculously easy to gank then). In fact, Specter's Cowl is so incredibly powerful against Teemo it's not even funny. To the point where I often just buy that item and don't upgrade it while I go back to my normal build and from there on it's smooth sailing.\n\nSo yeah, I wish the community would stop acting like he's cancer, and I wish Riot would stop nerfing him even further out of viability. Releasing these changes and having the balls to call it a buff, is just plain rude. (P.S: 1.5s arm time on shrooms makes the bounce gimmick completely fail its intended effect.)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sozan5","date":"2015-08-10T16:17:26.764+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hm, in this topic I see so many \"toxic kit\" comments. Practically all of them use \"lacks mechanical counterplay\" argument - which is true. There is not much you can do mechanically to avoid damage from Teemo. That's where other forms of counterplay come into place, and Teemo have tons of it (Strategical counters and counterbuilding).\n\nFirst of all, you know he can blind you (usually once, unless the fight is long), so you have to play around that, and there are multiple ways to do that. The best way, available to most champions in the League is to hold your abilities until he blinds you. Your abilities cannot be blinded (with few exceptions) and it's the best way of dealing damage during that time. Also, don't attack him while you are blinded, as this have no positive effect at all, while having few negative ones (mostly - your attack when blind ends will be delayed (this is especially vital for champs with low AS) and you are losing distance while attacking (even with cancelling the AA animation you still have to stop for a bit)).\n\nAs far as counterbuilding goes, it's pretty straightforward - build Banshee's Veil, Quicksilver Sash or Mikael's Crucible to completely negate the effect or Mercury Threads/Zephyr to mitigate it. Each of these items except Zephyr also grants MR, which is helpful against Teemo.\n\nAnother strategical counter to him (mostly for laning phase) is to hide in bushes. Pre-6 Teemo is unable to attack you at all in bushes - and top lane (which is where Teemo is at his strongest) have 3 of them (so it's gonna be hard for him to ward them). Post-6 bushes might be shroomed, so extra caution is advised.\n\nWhen going through lane, follow your minions pathing - this will ensure that any shrooms in the way will be tanked by minions.\n\nPost-6 you should use lens trinket (possibly getting it on the first/second back) before jumping on Teemo (or while chasing him) - as this will reveal and **disable** the traps for 6 seconds. This means you don't actually have to break them, you can run through them, or burst Teemo inside of them (this is a big one - I don't know how many times I've seen players to lens my mushrooms just to go around them or try to destroy them, while they could easily kill me).\n\nAnother viable strategy is to burst him down. This is true at all stages of the game, as Teemo builds usually are offensive (so no tankiness late game) and his early stats are just crap (they are okay in late game tho). \n\nIn teamfights Teemo isn't a big threat so you can dispose of him easily if he tries to do something and ignore him if he doesn't. If enemies start to retreat, don't forget to use Lenses.\n\nFor objectives you want to take, it's advised to place a pink ward around, so you can clear up the mushrooms and wards alike.\n\nAnyway, there are many more ways to counter Teemo, but I don't feel like listing all of them (especially since I play him from time to time, and I would hate to be countered in every possible way).\n\nTL;DR: Teemo is not countered by quick reflexes - he is instead countered by strategic thinking and optimal use of available tools.","replies":[]},{"poster":"VlKT0R","date":"2015-08-10T01:45:58.748+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"what about playing teemo as a backline damage dealer disengage master? like throwing mushrooms behind you instead of the enemy, kiting them during their engage or making it futile","replies":[]}]}
