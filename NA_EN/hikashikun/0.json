I honestly don&#039;t know what else to say. I&#039;ve played thousands of Teemo games, I hit high peaks on the ranked solo queue ladder, and played with and against the pros. I love playing him, I really do and I&#039;ve tried literally every build possible for him and of course, played him for each and every lane. \n\nHowever, thanks to the recent changes to Teemo, I feel like he&#039;s been gutted as champion - I made it to front page reddit on the LoL sub five days ago for hitting Masters with Teemo jungle; **I was only able to do it not because of the champion but because of the items I've used**. It&#039;s a joke and a half to be quite honest. Can I get some type of response from a Rioter about any potential changes for Teemo? His identity? There&#039;s so many people out there in the community that think these changes are a Nerf, not a Buff. There&#039;s been tons of posts made regarding how negatively these changes has affected him but no response from Riot. What do I need to do to get your attention? Make another front page reddit post? Cry out on social media? Create private messages to Riot employees who have a hand in the Champion changes? I tried drafting a huge analysis for the reasons why the changes made Teemo weaker, not stronger. I tried to adhere to the guidelines for post submission, to make room for healthy conversation regarding the topic (counter arguments, etc). \n\nI just don't know what to do at this point. I feel like there's no sense of responsibility or care to even respond to us players who enjoy playing Teemo, the champion. Who invested so much time in learning him. Sure, you guys made changes to him and you want us to change our gameplay based on those changes however, after all this time there's more and more negatives than positives to be had. We're all lost. Teemo has no identity, it's beginning to be not fun playing Teemo and I think that's a cause for concern for the community as a whole, not just Teemo mains.\n\nRanked History:\n\n* Season 2: 1500-1600 Raw ELO\n* Season 3: Diamond 1, 97 LP \n* Season 4: Masters 0,  LP\n* Season 5: Masters 15, LP \n\nProfile:\n\n* http://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=Hikashikun\n* http://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=Hikashlkun\n\nOther Information:\n\n* https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/3lr9yq/serious_just_hit_masters_playing_teemo_jungle/\n* https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/3mhux8/teemo_is_still_left_to_rot_after_the_changes/\n* http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/GvOfHdab-patch-515-teemo-nerfs-not-buffs\n* https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/3fwzku/no_1_teemos_opinion_on_the_changes_as_a_teemo_nerf/","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Dolan","date":"2015-09-27T07:48:57.593+0000","up_votes":35,"down_votes":8,"body":"Those nerfs to his passive and ult were brutal, I agree. 40% attack speed gone and 5 minute mushrooms hurt.

More than sure Riot has always wanted to rework Teemo, but him having probably the largest fan base in the game would make it difficult. \n\nThink of Lee Sin, whenever Riot dares nerf him his fan base flips out and all you see are Reddit posts about \"ogm lee is balance\". If Riot were to rework Teemo, they would most likely have to remove his blind, poison, and mushrooms (or just change them up a ton) which are his identity that for some reason people want him to keep. He'll never be viable and he's probably one of the weakest champions right now but if he ever was remotely strong he would probably be banned most games because he would prevent a player from enjoying the game with his current kit.\n\nHe's purposely kept in a bad state because of how toxic he is.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Budupops","date":"2015-09-27T16:18:47.353+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":9,"body":"noob now that devour is gone u r bronze","replies":[]}]}
