This is merely something I want to talk about out of curiosity.\r\n\r\nI think a permaban is kind of harsh even if you&#039;re the absolute worst. I know it&#039;s a free game but a lot of people do spend money on it thinking that they&#039;ll be able to keep their purchase until the end of time. I just think its messed up to take that away from somebody even if they are awful. And i&#039;m not really defending people who really deserve all the punishments they go but I know sometimes do receive a punishment for things they didn&#039;t deserve like afk reports for a bad internet connection or inting reports for some really unfortunate gameplay with unforgiving teammates. And maybe sometimes that&#039;s the tipping point into a permabanned account. Even if they were toxic in the past they shouldn&#039;t get a permaban 6 months down the line because their power went out during a storm.\r\n\r\nI know there&#039;s an appeal system but don&#039;t they very very rarely work out? I just think their should be an alternate system in place instead of just taking the game away from them completely. Maybe once they reach a certain amount of reports move them to another server full of &quot;toxic&quot; players so they all have to deal with each other like some other games do it. Maybe before they get to that point wipe their slate clean every season or after a long period of nothing but good behavior but if they still get to where a permaban would be triggered keep them on the toxic server for the rest of their time in the game\r\n\r\nJust a thought\r\n\r\n{{sticker:sg-soraka}}","replies":[{"poster":"AeroWaffle","date":"2018-05-31T05:29:58.536+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have yet to see someone perma-banned because they afk'ed or dc'ed unintentionally.

The point of the game is to play. It is entirely possible to play the game without &quot;interacting with others in a mature and respectful manner&quot;.\n\nThis is true. However, there are many players out there who enjoy talking with their teammates and/or opponents in some of their games when the opportunity arises for it.\n \n> In part.\n> \n> Are the degree holders still employed at Riot?\n\nI say in part because the IFS was built on the feedback of players from how the previous disciplinary systems, such as the Tribunal, operated. The Tribunal was a primarily player-run system, which while helpful had a number of problems, including being slow to process and assign cases as well as people spam punishing/pardoning cases just for the heck of it rather than actually reviewing the cases in question. Riot later introduced infinitely scaling chat restrictions and found while they worked for some for most others they just switched to inting and trolling to ruin peoples games, things much more difficult to catch and punish for than simple chat related offenses are. From [Riot Tantram:](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/wsObUaFj-if-tyler1?comment=00010001000000000000) \n\n> It really breaks down into two categories.\n> \n> 1.) Helping players reform\n> 2.) Shielding others from the behavior, at a cost.\n> \n> We used to issue chat restrictions that essentially scaled indefinitely. \n> \n> We were able to determine that after a certain point the penalty no longer helped with reform. The 10-game and 25-game counts for chat restrictions are based on data that they were both light enough, and felt strict enough to encourage people to understand their behavior is unacceptable in game and change it.\n> \n> We also saw that the players in this &#x27;large restriction&#x27; category defaulted to gameplay altering means of harassing their team. It caused an increase in feeding and trolling.\n> \n> The sample size of this population and time frame is huge. Essentially the time spanning from the introduction of chat restrictions to the introduction of IFS.\n> \n> So my question for you is, would you rather have more feeders and less negative chat?\n\nAs far as degree holders go as far as I know they still are, with only Lyte being one of the more notable ones with a degree to have left. That said though, it doesn't take a genius or a degree to figure out what kind of behavior is and isn't considered acceptable, at least in League of Legends anyways.","replies":[{"poster":"mlm olo mlm","date":"2018-06-01T17:51:20.483+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Prandine,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=00cvnEov,comment-id=000000020000000000000000,timestamp=2018-06-01T07:04:17.835+0000)\n>\n> While true to an extent, I feel this especially applies to those who go out of their way to ruin the game experiences of others.\n\nYou assume they are toxic \"for fun\".\n \n> Says who?

Toxic and consistently disruptive people drive away business, which of course means less potential money for Riot because of them. It's the same thing for pretty much any real-life establishment. It's better for both the business and the community if the one or two disruptive and poor behaving customers are removed from the establishment so that the 4-9 other customers can enjoy their product and time in peace.

A simple look through the Player Behavior forum will show that many people are being punished with chat restrictions and bans for consistently poor behavior. If you mean trolling and inting then that's not ignored either as gameplay related offenses when proven to be on purpose are assigned a 2-week ban as the first punishment.

Yes it’s just a few examples, but it proves that they do get punished.\n\n> Well geez, someone wants something for a reason? /s\n\nI've provided you with fair and legitimate reasons as to why it's in Riot's and the communities best interest to draw the line at a certain point, but here's another example. Sports in real life have rules to follow, even though they are just games to be played for fun. If you keep breaking them then eventually you're gonna be removed from the team as no one wants to play with a constantly misbehaving person.
