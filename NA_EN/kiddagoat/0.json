The mouse cursor is there and I can highlight the various parts of the map.  I can move the camera around.  \r\n\r\nThe issue is that no key strokes or mouse clicks are registered.  I cannot open the shop, I cannot open the game menu, I cannot level abilities, move the character or any input registered.  \r\n\r\nI have tried all the fixes listed.

Upon leaving the client and rebooting my computer the issue occurs again.\n\nAlso the new Windows Update came out recently and this occurred after applying the Windows Update and then launching League.\n\nI have tried the above and it is not fixing the issue at this time.\n\n*** This occurs when attempting to play Evelynn.  After using the above fix, I was able to play as Warwick just fine.  When I selected Eve and started a normal game, this issue happened again.***","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-12T20:49:38.496+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let's try deleting the entire Config folder this time, but don't just do it outside of the game. Follow these steps exactly to make sure you actually get those configuration files reset. Deleting them outside of a game doesn't always work since they're saved server side as well.\n\n- Log into the game client\n- Navigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\\n- Delete the folder named **Config**\n- Go into a practice game and verify that settings have saved properly. \n- Leave game to sync settings","replies":[]}]}
