Crashing doesn't reflect well on Riot's product, so those bugs, like the recent Sion one, are fixed relatively quickly. Non-crashing bugs are lower priority and take a while to patch, like the \"Azir leaves the fountain early\" bug that was around for a few patches.\n\nBalance changes for the alternate maps, whether item or champion, are rare. URF got about as many changes in one patch as TT and Dom combined got in years. (Skimming over patch notes since the start of 2015, it looks like there's been one champion change, a TT mini-rework, Mark/Dash added to ARAM, and about ten item changes to sync up with SR item changes.) Furthermore, alternate maps aren't typically considered when Riot makes new champs. Look at all the collection mini-games Riot's been adding in (Bard, GP, Garen) or the fact that Azir still has no passive at all on Dominion.\n\nBasically, the main impact of more game modes is that Riot needs to do that much more bug testing to make sure nothing crashes League. Balance concerns are an afterthought at most.","replies":[{"poster":"Kouga","date":"2015-08-29T08:03:20.435+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Minarde,realm=NA,application-id=LFfTlAky,discussion-id=ApgsBkEh,comment-id=0000000000000000,timestamp=2015-08-29T07:53:24.172+0000)\n>\n> Balance changes for the alternate maps, whether item or champion, are rare. \n\nI'd still disagree there. Rare(r) than SR changes, absolutely. And understandably the bulk of the work is front loaded - the development of the map and resources and any unique/special items and such are mostly going to be introduced at the start and then, over time, there are relatively few changes compared to the massive amount of changes that SR gets.\n\nHowever, its still something that requires their attention and resources. The 'mini rework' you mentioned is probably the same I'm looking at, 5.11 - but look how much was changed. 3 items (which don't exist in other game modes), the entire jungle, Vilemaw, the visuals, the altars, and so on. That's a pretty hefty amount of work that is going into a game mode & map that honestly I haven't played in years.\n\nBasically I just think there is more to it than most people saying, \"Just flip the URF switch on and leave it on\" - a lot more goes into the upkeep of these games than that when they're on a permanent basis.","replies":[{"poster":"Minarde","date":"2015-08-29T08:42:17.401+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">However, its still something that requires their attention and resources.

The visuals were reskinned versions of the SR stuff. I agree with your overall meaning though.\n\nHowever, it's not like changes of that magnitude happen regularly. I actually think the last time was the full rework back in March 2012. In that sense, it's not that much work when the map hasn't had changes in years.\n\nAnyway, I think we're arguing the same point from two different perspectives. You're claiming that upkeep balance changes would tax Riot, so more permanent modes aren't released. I'm claiming that the lack of balance changes tax maps' playerbases, so more permanent modes aren't released. So, yeah, \"more complicated than just flipping a switch\" sums it up well.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2015-09-01T03:34:16.379+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You said it yourself.
