Those that are have either shorter cooldowns (Akali, Katarina) or have decent power without the ult and can stall/contribute without being nearly entirely useless (Veigar). \n\nZed's basic ability scaling is pretty mediocre at best; 100% bonus AD scaling on a single target is nothing compared to, say, Talon's 140% or Yasuo's 100% total AD. Yes, his base damage makes clearing waves, but his scaling is....average. He's safe, though. \n\nAs for him underperforming, I think the buff is targetted specifically towards his laning; leaving a whole second before returning to shadow makes him ulting in the early game very dangerous; for an early/mid game carry, that's not good.
