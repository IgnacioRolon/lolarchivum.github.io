An example: When I play the game, I can clearly hear pings, item purchases, etc but I cant hear anything else, actually I can but is kinda weird and so low that I have to max my volume and even than my champion sounds r%%%%%ed. Its not only in league but twitch and youtube as well. Just watcher IWD streami on twitch and all I can hear is pinging and some weird song in the background, can't even hear him speaking. I already attempted to troubleshot but it says there's no sound problem detected?\r\n\r\nAnyone familiar with this?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-12-02T16:19:20.430+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If this is happening outside of game too then there could be some driver or hardware issues causing this.  See if the steps in the [FPS issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting) guide can help here to check your sound drivers for updates.  Depending on your sound source too, make sure that your wires are nicely socketed into their appropriate jacks.  :D","replies":[{"poster":"WolfChases","date":"2017-12-02T22:05:57.002+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ty so much!
