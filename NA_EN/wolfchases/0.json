My PC is medicore, it's not bad at all but I am getting MASSIVE FPS drops. Usually I have about 89-95 FPS but it just drops to 09 it lasts dor a few seconds and than rises back to ~80 and it drops all over again so I can barely play a game. I had no problems before the last patch update tho. Anyone facing similar problems?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-12T23:50:03.424+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You may have outdated drivers causing your frames to drop, or something else entirely.
