Also, be mindful of how you present your point of view. If a player feels strongly on a subject, don't get caught up trying to have the last word. Just state your side and exit the conversation gracefully rather than give them the opportunity to pick a fight.\r\n\r\nthen sure, whatever. Remove them if you think i broke the rules. What i said was mean, yes, i'm not denying that. I shouldn't have said that, at least on the Player Behavior board:\r\n\r\n>     ...please learn basics of montage making.\r\n  And nobody is targeting you, you messed up, you couldn't keep your feelings in check and you got punished for it.\r\n  By the way, you are just making a low effort shit post, right? Because i'm unwilling to believe someone could be so deluded outside of Twitch.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut can you keep it consistent? For example, taking a jab at someone's post sure might be a subject for removal, but calling me an idiot repeatably in THE SAME THREAD is not? \r\n\r\nI'm aware that many of you hate my views, but i'm not leaving, even if you would want me to.","replies":[{"poster":"Ulanopo","date":"2019-06-21T10:40:47.188+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"There are some things to keep in mind here:\n\n* You were reported by other people.

I get that if my comments were breaking the rules, they would be removed, and i have no problem with that.\n\nHere's the thing though. If the person i responded to, has a much more vile approach towards me and many other commenters, then it can be safe to assume a fair approach, right? \n\nThat was my only point.
