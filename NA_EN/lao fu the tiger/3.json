Since Riot said they'd be handing out icons if we played on the Alpha client once from November 10th or so until November 14th, I'm unsure if I'd be eligible for the icon.\r\n\r\n:( If not, I'd be sad, because I was a loyal tester. I'd hate to miss out because of bugsplats on launch for the past week.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-17T02:26:26.532+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As far as I know, so long as you logged into the Alpha at some point between when it launched and Nov. 15th, you should get the icon.
