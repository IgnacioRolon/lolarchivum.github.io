A) it only does good damage if you can follow up with attacks, otherwise the damage is fairly minimal, and B) just because his e makes him deal good damage when you attack afterwards doesnt make him good against everyone.  that doesnt make any sense.  what about all the champs that out range him?  what about those that excel at fighting?  what about those who can retaliate with abilities just as strong or stronger?  as for your skillshot point, you're kinda proving my point there.  his w is not hard to dodge and dodging it negates a MASSIVE portion of his power, especially his escaping power.  and no, not all champs are vulnerable to cc, and some are much more vulnerable to cc than others.  swain is one of those (and i never said in any way whatsoever that it effects only swain).\n\nhis w is like chogath's q, which is why it should be obvious just how easy it is to avoid.  also, to be able to q them to slow them they would have to be close enough for you to cast q, which is pretty close when you take swain's speed into consideration.\n\nyes, swain excels in teamfights, i was not missing that.  HOWEVER, thats only if the enemy team lets him by either getting him really fed in some way, or by entirely ignoring him during the fights.  if you focus him or even just cc him with anything but a slow you can reduce his effectiveness in teamfights enormously.  he is NOT guaranteed to land his w in a teamfight, just more likely IF they are densely grouped.  otherwise the chances are not much higher than lane phase.  you also seem to be way overestimating his damage and tankiness.  first of all, unless hes godly fed or you're all incredibly behind he wont be able to kill your team just by ulting into you.  first of all, he would die before then (again, unless in one of those situations) if you bother to attack him, and second you would go oom before you killed them all even if you had a seraphs.  you seem to be under the impression that the guy who mains swain wouldnt know this and that you would.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Slamurai Jack","date":"2015-11-17T23:47:04.444+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":6,"body":"Swain 55% win rate; wants buff.
