Every day I&#039;ll be posting a new champion with a short survey to get the community&#039;s input. Hopefully this will bring Rioters and players alike to civilly discuss all champions so we are all on the same page. The poll is just to get a general idea of how the community feels towards the champion&#039;s balance. Note, the results are not conclusive and may not reflect reality, but is just a way to gauge perception. Try to answer it honestly to the best of your ability! I won&#039;t bore you with this intro every day, just the first few or so.\n\n_____\n\n\n#Aatrox {{champion:266}} \n\nLet&#039;s discuss Aatrox, our favourite hack-em slash-em fighter.\n\nHow do you feel about him? What is he good at? What is he not so good at? Is he too strong or too weak? What do you feel could be improved about him? What should he be encouraged to build? What would you personally tweak if given the power to do so?\n\nJust post any of your ideas about Aatrox! Absolutely anything on your mind is welcome.","replies":[{"poster":"Doctor Jarvis","date":"2016-04-14T22:52:37.236+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aatrox has a lot of issues, all of them seemingly easily fixable. At first glance he seems like he SHOULD be a better Irelia; he wants to do a lot of the same things she does, his dive has CC, and he scales so insanely well off AS. So what gives?\nFirst thing I notice is that when I land a full rotation of skills, I don't FEEL like I've actually done anything except lose 15% of my current health. The shitty, one second knock-up does nothing, since he basically takes about the same amount of time to recover from the jump as the CC lasts. It should slow for a while after the knockup if you land it, and then maybe we can give him a real E. I know his E is useful for poking in lane but its so boring and non-consequential, especially in the middle of a team fight. And even though his ult gives him extra range, it has a cast time; as soon as its done, the people who WERE in melee range either aren't anymore (which sucks because you probably used your ONE dive to get to melee range) or they are because they're fighting you and you just kind of hope you can get off multiples of three hits to sustain through the damage (which, by the way, also makes the extra range useless).\nAnd for real, what the fuck is that passive? Not the gaining AS one, that makes sense (though the actual abilities that fill the blood well are on such obscene CDs) but the revive. The revive that removes all his extra AS. The revive that takes such a long time to go off. The revive does nothing for him except give him a second chance to die.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nazzadan","date":"2016-04-14T22:53:53.804+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He was supposed to be a drain tank, they gutted him and destroyed his identity, then they gave us Xin who is now a more effective drain tank with a single ability.\nHe needs work, he is now a completely dull, bland champion that tons of people do his job better.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Evewynn","date":"2016-04-14T22:52:09.569+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think it is generally accepted that Aatrox was a true missed potential champ, featuring an interesting character that was given a pretty flavorless kit. \n\nI've heard many suggestions of changing his ult to be some sort of aura buff to teammates, which would make sense for him lore-wise. In fact, the only part of the kit that I like is his w, and even that could probably use some sort of change. A teamfight-oriented fighter would be very interesting to try and do, and he is thematically a perfect contender for that role (could argue that champs like wu thrive in teamfights too, but I think there is room for more clearly defined teamfight fighters).\n\nMuch of his power is probably loaded into his passive, so I think that and his ult are the biggest opportunities for change. It doesn't help that his passive feels so bad to use, since his attack speed gets reduced so much afterwards.","replies":[]}]}
