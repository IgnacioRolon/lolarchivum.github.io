No, this does NOT mean they should be inherently more powerful than other champions. But I&#039;m willing to argue that at least 1/2 the time, the complaints about CertainlyT&#039;s champions aren't about them being \"OP,\" but as a refusal by the playerbase to even *try* to do anything about them. \n\nHis creativity and imagination are phenomenal. His champions may have a lot going on in them, but the guy honestly is a genius when it comes to ideas. Furthermore, all of his champions have TONS of levers to be balanced upon; after release, it&#039;s up to the Balance Team to handle making sure they come out in a fair manner. There is a reason, after all, why he&#039;s part of ChampUp and the Design team rather than the balance squad.\n\nGive the guy some respect.

He cannot be hit with a skillshot at a semi-decent distance and even worse, on any kind of chase whatsoever he generates his resource, flow, which gives him automatic kiting potential since he has huge, fast skillshots, no mana consumption, and a regenerating shield that only requires him to keep moving, which with nigh-unlimited dashing is never a problem.\n\nThresh was designed from the ground up in concept, by CertainlyT's own admission to be a character that was \"good in any role in any position\". He was supposed to be a top, mid, marksman, support, tank, jungler. That design is in and of itself inherently unhealthy, since the ability to play one-role usually comes with its own weaknesses that need to be compensated for.

He had everything you stated back when he was considered overpowered, and now that he is considered balanced, all of those characteristics exist (and are all easy to play against, as it happens, because of how specific they are).\n\nI think Thresh has an overloaded kit, definitely, but it DOES have counter play.  It's the age-old \"dodge the hook\" counterplay, which is extremely lazy design I grant, but if you can manage that all he can do it peel.  It takes a combination of his skills that make him extremely versatile, you take one thing out and he loses the ability to do multiple things.\n\nI don't follow Riot extensively, so ignoring player feedback isn't something I'm that aware of, however the example makes little sense to me.  Players asked \"How are we going to avoid being kited in bot-lane?\" which is Mordekaiser's 1 weakness.  He is INTENDED to be kited around for counter play; if he were to catch you, you would likely die.  That just sounds like players trying to find flaws in his kit designs, not really ASKING a question.  As for how it will pan out, I don't want to comment on morde until he is played extensively on live; judging something before you know how it works is dumb to me.\n\nAnd again with Yasuo, he was quite balanced on release.  He had an atrocious win rate because he was one of the most complex champions created up to that point and no one had learned how to effectively play him; the outcries you are describing were to _buff_ Yasuo.  And as it turns out, they did what the community asked, and paid for it multiple patches.","replies":[{"poster":"Trash ADC Btw","date":"2015-08-12T00:34:12.178+0000","up_votes":28,"down_votes":4,"body":"My pleasure. Always important to actually respond to criticisms of your points. If this guy wasn't gonna, I certainly would.\n\nYasuo is still considered terrible to play against by the majority of the player-base from what I can tell. Most people were very happy when he was disabled a little while back, because while he may be fun to play WITH, and he may have SOME counterplay now, he still is extremely anti-fun. I can safely say from my own experience it's far more fun when Yasuo's not in the game, allied or enemy, and this is coming from a tank-main, who should love being able to protect a squishy like Yasuo.\n\nLet me explain the problem with the \"dodge the hook\" counterplay. That's only defensive counterplay. When you try to attack into a thresh, he has an easy escape and kiting tool in Flay. You chase them, you get hit with flay, knocked back, slowed and generally lose the trade. You get hit with flay, good luck dodging the hook. You get hit with the hook, you're in the box. There's no way around it barring flash or a dash, which a good number of ADCs and ESPECIALLY supports don't have. It's important to remember that when a character has counterplay, it means they can be meaningfully attacked and defended against, NOT one or the other.\n\nThe problem is that the Mordekaiser rework is intent on shoving him exclusively into Botlane, since he's not allowed to use his W on anything but an allied champion. Not even a minion, anymore. While in botlane, you are going to be subject to kiting as Mordekaiser. As such, it's an important concern how that's not going to be an impossible scenario to play into. See the above \"Flay\" example. Mordekaiser has no tools for attacking into a lot of support/marksmen combos, and due to that, he's completely reliant on the ability of his own support to outplay TWO players at once, with him being completely unable to contribute anything to assist. Morde cannot safely farm, because he's melee in a ranged lane. Morde cannot safely defend turret, because he's melee in a ranged lane. Morde cannot safely approach, because he's melee in a CC lane, and Morde cannot rely on his support to out-CC the enemy, because he cannot provide anything to match the mobility, range or CC of any marksmen. That is the question. That is what CertainlyT ignored.\n\nAll champions have atrocious win-rates or free-elo win-rates on release. Yasuo's KIT is the problem. Once a sufficient amount of skill has been obtained with Yasuo, he's almost impossible to play into with a HUGE selection of champions. Try landing anything with Xerath. Try landing anything with Viktor.","replies":[{"poster":"ElJanitorFrank","date":"2015-08-12T02:04:35.959+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm a little sad that people are downvoting you, I'd rather the posts stayed neutral in a debate like this.\n\nNow, I'm a Viktor main, he's got a few abilities blocked by wind wall, and he's an immobile mage.  However, I have absolutely no trouble fighting Yasuo, I actually think it's quite fun.  I don't see 'staying away from my minions' as an obnoxious product of his kit, I find baiting him into trying to harass me, and then harassing him back as a fun mini-game esque activity.\n\nI might just concede on the point of Thresh.  I do believe that his abilities are not strong enough on their own, however it is a bit too easy to land them in succession.  I will say that Thresh takes skill to be used effectively, and the use of him effectively makes counter play very hard to do, but it CAN be done.\n\nAnd I disagree on Mordekaiser.  Right now, Riot (CertainlyT) is simply testing the waters, seeing if a bruiser can go bot lane with a support.  And you know, Mordekaiser is easily the best melee champion to do so, courtesy of his passive shield.  He is one of the few melee champions that doesn't care about auto attack harass at all; making him the perfect 'test-subject' if you will, to see how a bruiser/support combination works bot lane.\n\nI skimmed most of the last paragraph, and am only now seeing the point of Viktor on the end :P.  But with Xerath, actually, the ONLY ability blocked by his windwall is Xerath's E.  Every thing else is reliant on Yasuo dodging and Xerath predicting.  With Viktor, the first part of his Q and his E are blocked, _however_ , you can place your E on the other side of his wall and hit him from that side.  It makes landing it incredibly easy; even though you are a bit too close for comfort, his movement are extremely predictable and it'll make landing the laser easy.\n\nNot to say that there are champion who do have poor match ups with Yasuo, what with their abilities getting blocked a lot, but if you take the wind wall out of the equation (it's got what, a 20 second cooldown?) then I don't think any champion would have troubles against him, if played correctly.  It would result in some skill match ups, sure, but there aren't any STRONG counters at that point.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LeeDark","date":"2015-08-12T11:00:21.157+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":8,"body":"1)  Yasuo: you have jack-all to back this up.

Yasuo's dash is a fixed distance in a straight line.\n\n2)  Morde has ALWAYS had a problem against kiting, and yet plenty of Morde mains managed to do well in games where they got counterpicked in lane.  Morde will ALWAYS outlevel his opponents in bot lane, and he still has his shield.  Now, is the shield properly balanced to keep him alive enough in bot?  I don't know; I haven't played the rework yet.  Maybe it should be buffed.  The fact remains, he still definitely has the tools to do well there without giving him a built in dash or CC.  I would definitely say they shouldn't have nerfed his base move speed, at least not so heavily.

With decent amounts of skill, you can dodge just about anything just about anytime with Yasuo. That is a fact.\n\nW. Cannot. Be. Used. On. Himself. Or. Minions. Anymore.

I have spoken with dozens of players who have played the rework and they unanimously agree that it's hamfisted, backwards and completely unfun.

His ultimate and Fiora's are different. Fiora could just point and click to deal Master Yi type damage to multiple enemies dealing tons of damage while also being able to take no damage for a longer period than Yasuo. True, as it is when a lot of champs now have knock-ups (as does Yasuo) but his ultimate has its drawback that it must have enemies in the air and in Yasuo's range to activate it. Then, there's the damage. When you focus on critical damage, you aren't able to even get a lot of AD. (This is also a reason I wish they'd just try and find a better Yasuo passive.) Even with 150% AD, you might only get up to 300 bonus damage (maybe at most 400) and with the base damage its just 800 at best. It takes a lot to get someone up in the air. I've also found that champs like {{champion:34}} {{champion:63}} or other mages have the best effect on him because they can bypass his windwall easily and inflict tons of damage from a good range.\n\nThresh (to me) is far better than a {{champion:53}} in bot lane. (And don't tell me otherwise.) His Q is more fair than Blitzcranks Q. Blitzcranks Q flies faster than Thresh's, it also comes back faster, it also doesn't stop halfway, and Thresh can't just activate a ability as he flings his Q. Also, Blitzcrank's E is yet another stun/knock-up that deal double his damage while Thresh just pushes a person back dealing some damage and slowing them for a moment. Blitzcrank's W gives him bonus AS and MS. He's a  Tank, why does his need bonus MS and AS? At least Thresh just flings out a lantern that just shows a small area, its also only useful for his allies; doesn't do nothing to a enemy but watch a almost kill get away. Their passives are different; though Thresh gains bonus armor infinitely, he doesn't just automatically gain it, it takes every two souls, meanwhile, Blitzcrank gets a mana shield that activates on low health and can go to great lengths as one of the best shields in the game (beating Shen's ultimate that itself has drawbacks). And now, the R's; Thresh makes barriers that deal A LOT of damage when someone hits it (doesn't work a second time) and slows them a lot, meanwhile Blitzcrank passively deals tons of damage to nearby enemies and deals a lot of damage in a small area to enemies, also silencing them. To me, I'm glad he made Thresh, not crazy about his early release, but glad Thresh replaces Blitzcrank.\n\nMordekaiser is really fun right now. Could use some buffs to that W, at least allow monster kills to be given a W and/or allow minions to be given it as well. (The fact it doesn't work on monsters annoys me.)\n\nAlso, if I were to play against a Yasuo with myself as a Victor, I'd just poke him with my Q and wait for moments to trap him with my W to use my E. Also, if he gets too close, I'd W the ground and R him. If I were to be Xerath, I'd W to poke him, wait for good moments to use my E to stun and good moments to use my Q. Also, if he hides at Tower or I see him farming and I'm close enough, I believe I'd hit him with my R's, him or the minions.

It's also nearly instant (and many mage spells have delays), making it hard to \"outplay\".  In addition, Yasuo can dash 6-7 times per minion wave, so dodging skilshots for him is hilariously easy.

They don't count as examples.\n\nThe problem with CertainlyT's champions (excluding Darius) is that they tend to do *everything*.  They have no real weaknesses, or when they do, their kits have tools to allow them to negate those weaknesses.\n\nI'm not going to mention Darius here because he doesn't follow the pattern of the other champions (plus, I don't personally play top so I'm not experienced enough to really analyse him.)\nThat leaves Thresh, Yasuo and Kalista.\n\nThresh does *everything*.  His Flay alone is one of the most powerful abilities in the game (though yes, it takes skill to use well), but he also has a \"dodge or die\" hook (not as good as Blitzcrank's, but still there), a shield, a free escape for anyone on his team, an ult with massive area control, and a shield.  He literally has so much going on on his kit that even if they reduced all his numbers to nothing and removed the poke he gets on his Flay passive, he'd probably still be the most-picked and most-versatile support.  This isn't a numbers issue, his design has too much in it and can never be truly balanced while keeping all of the tools he has in his kit.\nOther supports are good at one or two things, but Thresh does it all.  And this probably the *best* of the three champions\n\nYasuo also has a lot going on in his kit, but his main problem isn't so much the overload but the fact that he has the tools to negate his weaknesses so well that he can effectively invalidate a lot of champions.  He hard-counters many mage champions who are reliant on skillshots and use mana, while also having great damage, late-game scaling, and strong utility even if he's behind.\nRiot love to talk about how abilities (and champions) should have counterplay, and one of the things that are often used as an example of counterplay is skillshots - which is true in most cases, but a champion like Yasuo can dash so often for free that he becomes almost impossible to hit with skillshots, yet he doesn't pay anything for this strength.  Take for example a Katarina using Shunpo to dodge a skillshot - she puts an important skill on a fairly long cooldown by doing so.  Someone like Ezreal goes one farther and also has a significant mana cost added.  These champions can use their skill, at a cost, to outplay a skillshot.  Yasuo gets to do it for free, with no cost and almost no cooldown.  Furthermore, if there is something he cannot dodge (a skillshot with no minions near, or a non-skillshot projectile) he can throw up his wind wall to block it.  This does have a long cooldown, giving it some risk, but the effect is lessened when added to his crazy mobility.  Finally, for what damage does get through his first two defences, he has a third defence - a free shield - to block even more damage.  He basically has three tools that are each strong against poke mages, all for free (while the mage needs to use mana to do their thing), and combined together they make him an absolute nightmare to play against as any kind of ranged skillshot mage.  He basically invalidates an entire subset of the champion pool, and you are forced to pick something else in order to have a chance to lane against him.  Again, all of this does require skill on the part of the Yasuo player - but after a certain level of Yasuo's skill, his opponent's skill doesn't really matter any more, because the Yasuo can negate almost anything the opponent can do.\n\nFinally, we get to Kalista.  Again, she has a lot of things going on in her kit.  She has a delayed damage pattern, a lot of utility, and works very well with a support.  That alone would have made a viable champion, but in addition to that she has a passive that gives her unparalleled mobility when near targets to attack.  This has all of the same issues as Yasuo's mobility - it makes her almost completely immune to skillshots.  Since she is free to hop in any direction and not just through enemies like Yasuo, she's even better at evading skillshots, since she can change direction at random, or even once the skillshot projectile is already in-flight.  Yes, this takes mechanical skill, but again after a certain level of mechanical skill she can completely negate an entire class of champion.  Her infinite hops also make her almost completely immune to champions with a shorter range than her, unless those champions can gapclose to her and kill her instantly (or CC her long enough to kill her.)\nAgain, this is a champion whose kit allows her to negate the skill of her opponent and to hard-counter a large subset of champions.\n\nYou'll notice that none of the things that I've complained about here are numbers or power levels.  They are, instead, problems with the kit of the champions that make them almost impossible to balance, extremely frustrating to play against, and actually break several of Riot's own design philosophies (basically, having champions who hard-counter others to such an extent breaks Riot's goal that games should not be won in champion select.)\nThe balance team is left to try to clean up the mess, but it's really difficult for them.  They can try to either massively reduce the numbers to make the champion seem balanced (like Yasuo, who is \"balanced\", verging on weak, but still retains all of his problems and is still heavily hated by the people who have to play against him), or they can try to nerf/adjust basic parts of the game for that specific champion to try to bring their power level down (adjusting Kalista's autoattack ratios, which makes her closer to \"balanced\" but doesn't change any of her hard-countering issues), but none of these changes can really fix the champions because the design is too overloaded and impossible to balance.  The champions really need reworks to bring them in line, despite only being recent releases.\n\nAs for CertainlyT, he designs champions who have great thematics, well-designed characters, unique mechanics, whose kits feel fluid and fit well together.  He has a lot of good ideas, but the problem is that he puts too many of them into a single champion, resulting in an overloaded mess, instead of keeping the unique ideas and spreading them out more over different champions.  This isn't entirely CertainlyT's fault, though, since the rest of Riot's design team approve and champions and allow them to get added to the game, and also help with the design and implementation.\nAlso note that CertainlyT's champions aren't the only offenders; there are other champions with similar design issues.  It's just that nearly all of his champions have them, and they are also more recent than most of the other offenders (where \"Riot were new and didn't know any better back then\" can be used an excuse.)\n\nWhat I can't understand is how the designers can talk about Riot's design values, especially when talking about reworking or redesigning older champions, but the same rules are broken and ignored for (some) newer champions.\n\n\nI don't really have anything to comment on the Morde rework.

But the ignoring of well thought out feedback on *HIS* thread is upsetting. When he changes the identity and playstyle of a champion people that play said champ are going to be upset. THE biggest issue 90% of the player base that has played Mord on the PBE dislike his new W on how it can not be cast on anyone but ally champions. Gimping an already established champion to fit his needs without actually explaining _why_ he did what he did is what aggravates people. His quote of \"Mord will never be a marquee example of a healthy solo laner\" is a tad ridiculous. Without giving any context all we Mord players feel is that he decided to change a champion completely, take away part of his identity (he can no longer push waves like before until late game), made him more easily gankable and made 1/4th of his kit unusable in any other lane, without any sort of context besides the quote above, is ridiculous. If he tried explaining why he did what he did I am sure most of the hate that he has been receiving would not be happening.","replies":[]},{"poster":"I is Illiterate","date":"2015-08-12T02:54:06.425+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Regardless of how the community responds, it's his job and duty as a game/champion designer to communicate with the community and respond to feedback.
