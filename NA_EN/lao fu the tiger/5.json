They&#039;re not satisfied by fairness and are strictly influenced by what they want rather than what&#039;s fair.\r\n\r\nhttp://champion.gg/champion/Kalista/ADC\r\n\r\nAccording to this site, in high level play, Kalista is below a 40% win rate. Love or hate the champion, this is incredibly weak, and I was simply curious whether or not there were any plans in the future to give her some small changes to help bump her back to a decent state in the game.\r\n\r\nI don&#039;t like playing against Kalista, but regardless of what I like or don&#039;t like, I value fair gameplay and balance above wanting a certain champion to be dumpstered just because I dislike playing against it.\r\n\r\nSo, having said that, are there any pending plans to make her more relevant again?

If a hard-counter champion who has as much generalist power as Kalista is ever even *passably* decent, then they totally invalidate whole classes of champions.\n\nIf Kalista is ever going to be good, she either needs to lose ALL her objective control, map control, and initiation (all her generalist power) to make her a niche hard-counter champion.  OR she needs a new passive.\n\nOf those I think the latter would be better for the game.  A Marksmen focused heavily on objective control is an interesting niche for her to fill.  A Marksmen focused heavily on making people who like melee champs hate the game really isn't.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sch√†denfreude","date":"2016-10-15T00:02:23.426+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Who is Lao Fu?","replies":[]}]}
