As far as my low elo, I went 5 games of s ranked wins and then I had teams that top and bot went 0/8 in 5 minutes and at that point what can one do when they have 4 fed and me and my opponent mid lane are still 0/0? That was 5 games straight of feeders and since rankings are win or lose I got placed s4. \n\nHe isn't op in the slightest, but he is a fighter/assassin ment to just kill. Saying he is op is none sense. Morde is op he can 5v1 under fed and low hp. Yasuo takes a lot of countering skill shots and outplays to win and he is a squishy. Leblanc for example does half hp damage with her being level 1. And yasuos q or e being which ever you start with won't do near that amount of damage. At level 3 she has stuns Sasha hits and really just an overwhelming kit.","replies":[{"poster":"THE FIR3BLOOD","date":"2015-11-06T06:50:24.131+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mordekaiser actually is oppressive and too strong, but isn't OP. Xin Zhao on Release was OP, Yasuo on Release was OP. Mordekaiser fulfills his role Riot gave him - simply too good, but that doesn't mean he is OP. Also he can't 1v5 the whole enemy team under normal circumstances. If your bot always rushes to the lane and try to kill Morde while being 4k gold behind it is possible, but not in normal games. Don't overexxagerate.\n\nThe same with Le Blanc. She will take \"half of Yasuos HP\" if she has her first item faster. Level 1 spells without high amounts of AP (she has normal AP scalings) will be used go for poke or utility - and that's like 5~10% HP without having the shield up - which is nothing compared to Yasuos level 1/2. \nSimply by looking into your matchhistory I can tell that you're bad at Yasuo. Most of the time you don't build IE right after Shiv. That's not a problem, if you at least go for Tri Force for your second item after Shiv, but you didn't bother doing this either. You run around with 80% CR and don't bother to get to 100%, sometimes you even built Stinger, which is utter bullshit on Yasuo. Your masteries are completely unviable for sustaining in-lane and your runes are as bad as your masteries. The only time you got a good KDA was due to your team carrying through the TFs.\n\nHonestly you shouldn't post anything about Yasuo anymore. I don't react to others ELO ('cuz I exactly know how it is in to rank silver-gold), but talking about champions you haven't mastered (that includes masteries and runes for them, as well as the itemization) is utterly bullshit.

Secondly they nerfed champs like Leblanc, but her at level 1 does half your hp in damage. Plus the stuns and slows and all of it combined rock Yasuo. Yasuo is easy to counter. His basic q does 1/10 the damage of most mid landers. He has a wind wall which does no damage, his ult depends on his skill shots his e does damage but no where near as much as other champions. And his q doesn't do that much damage unless you feed him. At which point all fed opposites become op anyways. But he isn't like veigar where even if he is 0/12 he can come back.

It's the same with other champions too. Gragas won't go for AP builds and therefor is only tanky being far ahead, but doesn't deal high amounts of damage. Just two examples.\n\nFor your listed champs:\n{{champion:92}} is a snowball champions with high mobility and a shield to avoid getting blown up in TFs instantly. Riven is only strong being ahead, if Riven is behind she isn't a problem, even with her kit being \"oppressive/unfair\".\n{{champion:45}} isn't a problem if you don't let him farm. The only thing in TFs he can do is to land his stun and/or pressure the enemys positioning and blowing up the enemy squishies. He is listed as a control-mage with good late-game scaling for good reasons. He won't comeback if he loses the lane and not having anything to farm for AP and not having his core items.\n{{champion:82}} is oppressive and stupid ATM.\n{{champion:7}} has a scnare, not a stun. And this snare has to land and you have to be 1.5 seconds near LeBlanc to actually get snared and damaged. Her dashes are well visible and predictable - you consider yourself as Yasuo \"main\" so you should know that - so >GOOD< Yasuos can avoid both by using his dash or Windwall. The only things LeBlanc can hit 100% in-lane are her Q and Ult due to them being point&click, but they can be blocked by Windwall.\n{{champion:35}} has a great early-mid and falls off hard in late, even while being ahead. That's his trade-off for being a great ganker, especially in low-elo where some random guys call themselves \"main\", but are crap at the game and their \"main champ\".\n{{champion:67}} is just overpowered, if you don't have any CC for her. Her laning ATM is too strong for her late-game scaling, that's true, but picking some CC would help against her later on. Just focus the backline...\n\nYou don't even know the differences between stun and other CCs. You call his Q a \"hard to land skillshot\", which turns into a AoE knock-up after E->Q and his ultimate deals more damage than his Q/AAs, can crit and gives you even while ulting 50% armorpenetration. Just having 3 second CC in the kit and having the possibility to block damage two times in a TF is good enough for TFs while being behind.\nStop talking about things you can't comprehend and learn the game.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"spank me lee","date":"2015-11-06T03:32:45.183+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Don't worry, the boards are just on its period, the actual players of the game dont think like that or even give a shit.","replies":[{"poster":"Bultz","date":"2015-11-06T04:32:44.177+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"like right?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Durzaka","date":"2015-11-05T19:44:30.495+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thats the point though...\n\nIf people dont complain, things have a chance of not getting done.\n\nComplaining/giving feedback is fine.
