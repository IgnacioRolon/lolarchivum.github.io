That specific skin *IS* rather expensive to be completely honest, but that's one of only a few because they are ultimate skins.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Generic Fox","date":"2017-12-20T21:35:53.265+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're out of luck I think. If you REALLY want that skin, then you should definitely hold onto that skin shard because you will eventually be able to get enough essence, and that skin is expensive as hell.
