It'd be a much bigger issue if they were enabled but then some content was lost left and right during auto-transfers. They want to make sure nothing goes wrong, and it's hard to put a concrete date on when something will be fixed until we know exactly what the problem is.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kiun","date":"2018-01-18T02:44:09.906+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"They said it will be available at the end of January or begin of February.\n\nMay takes them longer, they already said that it should be available after the Season ends and after that promised, that they will bring it back in 4-6 weeks.
