I have about 40 champs on 5+ mastery score and only 3 left where i can get chest. Try something else than poppy. \nAnd one more thing (tip), play some normal blind with some supp or tenk for example who is easy you will get chest than :)","replies":[{"poster":"Dephy","date":"2017-10-26T19:02:48.002+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nope, i have not gotten my chest with her.
