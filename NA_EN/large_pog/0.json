We could lower the cast time (or remove it completely), but that would likely make her mobility overall STRONGER.\n\nCopy pasting my response to a recent reddit thread on the subject of Trist and buffering below:\n\n> This is due to cast-time buffering. To compensate for things like network lag, spells in League that have cast times are favored to go off (even if you are stunned during said cast time). This does create some frustrating experiences where you land your hook on Trist and she just bounces out of it, but on the flip side, if the spell were instant, that hook would have never landed in the first place.\n> Trist's W is strong to be sure, but it having a cast time makes it a good degree weaker. Better she's stunned after jumping away from you than never stunned at all.\n> \n> To get into what I mean by \"network lag compensation,\" imagine you're playing against Riven (who has an instant stun with no cast time, enabling it to preempt your cast times) and Annie (who's Q stuns after a travel time). If you push Q at the same time Annie does, both of your spells will go off, as her stun takes a bit to reach you. If you push Q at the same time as Riven stun, it's very possible that (based on latency) Riven's stun will go off slightly before your spell. If this happens, not only will you be stunned, but you will be left wondering why your spell didn't go off. You pushed the button when you weren't stunned, and yet the spell failed to cast. Makes the game feel clunky and unresponsive, and at times will cause players to do things they don't want to (like continue running into a fight after the stun wears off because they thought they had cast their dash/ult/fight turner which would have made them stop for a cast time and change their trajectory).\n> \n> These types of interactions are one of the reasons silences (especially instant ones like Raka E) feel so bad in our game. They have poor feedback that something has happened, and so players attempt to cast their spells, don't get a result, run places they don't want since there was no cast time to stop them, and then come out of it feeling like the game is laggy and unresponsive.\n\nAnother question we could ask, in a hypothetical world where Trist feels oppressive, is:  What should be true about the rest of Trist's kit given she has such a powerful W.\n","replies":[{"poster":"Poppystar","date":"2017-10-21T01:37:35.799+0000","up_votes":36,"down_votes":4,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot jinxylord,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=YxYzikyg,comment-id=0017,timestamp=2017-10-21T00:40:14.666+0000)\n>\n> We could certainly nerf Trist jump to be interrupted by CC but that would likely make the spell feel pretty awful to use, the vast majority of dashes in our game cannot be canceled in that way and I&#x27;m not sure Trist&#x27;s W should be uniquely bad in that regard considering it has a .5 second cast time.

I don't hope for people at the Boards to understand this, or to remember how bad Trist was for a while, but I hope you guys realize that Trist didn't get better, it was just the game that changed around her and made her feel stronger.\n\nSecond: I've said it for a long time and have quoted Professional Players such as DoubleLift, Sneaky, Rekkles or Forg1ven who understand this champion in and out to reflect what Tristana's identity is and has always been: **The best late game self peeling hypercarry**\nI bring that up because last year and before he left Riot, Scarizard commented on Trist during a Live Q & A on Twitch, where he said you guys didn't know what to do with her, and from further posts from Meddler, I got the impression you forgot Trist's identity.\n\nContinuing from the previous point, the one skill I don't see how it fits her kit, is her ability **to put bombs on towers** and tear them down.\nThematically, it makes no sense. She's **\"The Bandle Gunner\"**, not **\"The Bandle Demolitionist\"** or **\"The Bandle Bomber\"**.\nFrom a design standpoint, is the only thing on her kit that has no synergy with anything else. it used to reduce the cooldowns on Q and the charge itself, but that's long gone and I don't really mind. But we have a kit built around **late game scaling**, with her resets, the range from her passive, the disengage from her ult, and the mobility of her Rocket Jump. Where does _\"Bomb into towers\"_ fit into any of that? It has always felt incredibly gimmicky, and with the towers being so paper thin right now, of course her push power is gonna feel over bearing. I seriously wouldn't mind in the slightest if that interaction was removed entirely from her kit, and I believe that would bring her quite down **without harming the core of her identity**.\n\nAsk any Pro currently playing her, and I'm completely sure that they'll say that they don't pick her because _\"Oh yeah, we take her to demolish towers\"_ but as everyone knows, she's picked for her scaling and late game team fighting strengths.\n\nGoing back to my first point: Tristana is a champion that used to spike around 30 - 35 minutes, when she finally had 3 items that would normally be an IE and two Zeal items, or an IE, a Zeal item and a LW item. The issue right now **is that she's spiking at 20 - 25 mins because how accessible and effective Critical Strike items are**, and this is the reason why she feels too strong sometimes. She shouldn't be spiking so early, that's not how a late game hyper carry should work. **I do not want Trist to be strong in lane or in the early game**, I wanna farm and then be ready to fight when I get my third item. Then early game champions get a window to take advantage of.\n\nI feel (I could be wrong...) that this is a direct result of you guys attempting to speed up the game more and more every time. Early-Mid Game ADCs become irrelevant, because the game now scales so fast, that why would anyone pick an Early-Mid Game ADC? Hyper carries can reach better results at roughly the same time and be better if the game takes longer.\n\nI conclude my post asking you to **please** do not forget what Trist's identity is and the reason why some of us enjoy playing her so much. As I told other people, the Jump buffer is a way to express our knowledge/mastery of whatever champion that can do that, and it's not as if the skill didn't have counter play. Used defensively (usually the use of the buffer) leaves the skill on a 14 second cool down, which often equates to a jumpless Tristana for an upcoming fight. Burning her jump often leaves enough time for a team to siege a tower, engage a fight where Trist can't jump away, or focus a Drake/Baron and turn to fight with the ADC having no escape. It's on the Trist player to know when to better use her jump.\n\nIn the end, the game is yours and you'll do as you see fit, but this is a champion I highly care for and desire to be treated fairly, even if so many people hate her right now. She wasn't touched for over a year (2016), and for a long time was at the bottom of the ADC tier list, but it seems people don't remember that right now.\n\nThanks for your time, if you read this.\nCheers!","replies":[]},{"poster":"A Dizzy Lulu","date":"2017-10-21T04:30:03.161+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"remove the slow off of her w. hidden power and it's completely unneeded","replies":[]},{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2017-10-21T03:35:59.287+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"In a world where Trist feels oppressive, she has several problems:\n\n* You have a hard time catching her, thanks to Rocket Jump, Flash, and her disengage Ult.\n* You can have a very hard time getting away from her in a team fight, as every kill or assist helps her close the gap.\n* She has the ability to completely wreck towers, thanks to her sticky bomb and attack speed boost.\n\nRolling that all together, you've got a champion with lots of safety when things go bad, lots of chase when things go good, and is a tower shredder.\n\nI'd say pick which you want to keep: the Yordle Gunner who wants to jump all over all the fight, or the Yordle Gunner who melts towers. Melting towers lines up better with how I think of Tristana, but it's probably too weak an identity in the Marksman role (which as a whole kills towers fast).
