His spears are a strong harass tool, his stun and heart seeker provide really good engage and damage. So I don't understand why we need to give him this \"block\" to proc to basically deny any melee top any counter play to his long range good AD ratio damage dealing spears.   \n\n  His block is a bit absurd, I've seen him block attacks 3-4 times in a single 8 second period. As Fiora, I've seen him turret dive me, I attack he takes turret damage, I ult on him he runs away from turret. And when my ultimate stops, he has yet another proc on his block. He literally just blocked the turret once, and me twice within a 5 second window....  I think a simple fix for this would be as follows \"Pantheon blocks can not  proc more then once in a 10 second period) It would add counter play to him instead of just accepting endless spears with nothing you can do about it.  It would make him have to be more thoughtful about how he wants to use his blocks, but also not nerf him into nothingness. \n\nThoughts? Should we put Pantheon block on a timer where it can't be proced more then once in a time window?\n\nEDIT:: I think Pantheon is balanced and his entire kit is fine, I just think his block offers 90% of champions playing against him very little to no counter-play. It's almost impossible to trade with him unless you have target clicking ranged abilities as well.

It doesn't work like that. Nor quite frankly do I think should it every work like that. It creates an incredibly mundane environment. Some champions are going to destroy other champions by virtually of hard counters in the way their kit is designed against another champion's kit, in your case you found out the hard way, Fiora gets completely wrecked by Pantheon.

He is designed to duel and snowball his lane or others if jungling. The reason why he is strong early is because in lane most laners get ahead of him at level 6 because they have an ult and he doesn't and by that I mean he cant really use his ult on you while in a fight and it's easy to knock him out of it. If he doesn't get fed he falls of like a rock over a cliff when he reaches mid game. Just play passively against him and let the game drag out and you'll beat him just by outscaling him.\n\nAlso that passive change could kill him. He builds up prcs by using his AA's and Q and E and gets a full proc with W. Note that he needs 4 stacks to get a shield proc not including his W (the shield bash). if he has 3 stacks and then W's you for a full shield it will stop stacking until his his shield is down which allows him to get 2 shield procs off one right after another. All he has is his early game and if you nerf that it screws him over.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zeliwin","date":"2014-11-28T23:11:43.339+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In my opinion it's an ability that offers zero counter play as it pretty much stands. It's unpredictable. I don't know any counter play for it, only when I play Darius or something I'll try to do an auto attack before my Q, to get the proc off. But even then, sometimes the block procs back up so fast it turns the tides of the battle.
