I'll break it up into two sections: Things I like, and things I don't like/Find Frustrating/Feel Need Fixing. Let's do the latter first, because negative emotions are always at the forefront of anyone's mind, right? (Sorry if this comes off condescending/privileged or \"uppity\", not my intention guys xD)\r\n\r\nDislikes/Desired Fixes/Frustrations:\r\n- Yordle comp bonus is horribly uninspired. Sorry if that comes off a bit aggressive, but it's true. Yeah, they're small, we get it, but making them sometimes impossible to hit? That just feels terrible to play against. Super frustrating. \r\n- Demon class needs more variety in their secondary roles, ex: Aatrox. Why is he just a blade master? Why isn't he also a Brawler? I feel that would make more sense, given that he himself doesn't really benefit from his Blademaster bonus, and that he needs some survivability to even get off his skill. \r\n- Glacial comp feels HORRIBLE to play against. I like the IDEA of freezing people, sure, but it feels extremely frustrating to just sit there and watch your team just...not move. Like, their health bars just wittle away...while they do nothing. An alternate route you could take that is way less frustrating, would maybe be a Chilled/Frost effect? Something that slows attack speed, movement speed, mana generation, etc.. Being constantly stunned all round feels terrible to play against.\r\n- Rek'Sai has very little success, mostly I believe due to some type of bug in her pathing with her ability, at least i assume. But, even if she did target and use it correctly, her ability is kind of counter-intuitive to her role. She's supposed to be a tanky, front-liner with CC. But, when she uses her skill, the enemies kind of ignore her and go for the back-liners, since she's untargetable. I mean, I guess I could see where you guys went with it, for the whole \"Diver\" concept of her, but if that was the case, her Ult would be a much better option for the skill. All-in-all, her ability needs to be replaced/fixed heavily, because all she is really good for at the moment is her bonuses she can give as Void/Brawler. \r\n- Warwick's bug where he does nothing and just stands there? FeelsBadMan\r\n- Pure Assassin teams are extremely dominant, and I feel they need to be toned down a bit. Perhaps reducing their bonus damage?\r\n- Why is Kassadin a sorcerer? He doesn't use spells, and thus wouldn't even benefit from its bonus, so why is he one? He'd make more sense as a Blademaster, since he just auto-attacks. \r\n- The Shrink blade item feels terrible to use, and barely does anything. Kind of a waste of those items. \r\n- The Dragon Buff, where Shyv/ASol are immune to magic damage? That, once again, feels super bad to play against. Literally shuts down so many champs, making them useless. Something that would feel better, and maybe make more sense, would be to give the 2 a flame aura, maybe? Sounds neat to me :D\r\n- Guardian's bonus is pretty underwhelming, mostly because Braum is kind of not-great/trash? Should be something more interactive, since you need those 2, and 1 of those 2 is a T4 champ. \r\n- Akali feels a bit broken, due to her low mana pool for her ability; it's pretty insane damage in a cone...\r\n- (People already are talking about Pyke)\r\n- Item's effects stacking is pretty broken, I don't really think they should- seeing a Pyke with double Shojin, or a Vayne/ADC type with double guinsoo's? FeelsBadMan. \r\n\r\nNow, onto the Likes!\r\n\r\n- I love the Demon comp's mana burn! Feels super good to play, and can really turn the tide of a fight!\r\n- Brawler! Love this! Feels super good to have a beefy front line :D\r\n- Varus is my favorite champion, and I feel that you guys really did him justice in this game mode, so thanks for that! :D\r\n- Phantom is a kind of neato concept\r\n- I like the idea of Elementalists summoning Daisy, it's pretty cool- really gives it a \"Battlefield of mages\" type of feel ^^\r\n- You really captured the fantasy of a lot of champions, like Varus, Kha'Zix, Rengar and Yasuo, given how they play in this game mode, so good work on that!\r\n\r\nThat's kind of all I've got for now? I don't think it does the game justice that my \"Dislikes\" are so much longer, but trust me when I say: I. Love. This. Mode. Honestly, I barely even play on Summoner's Rift now! I just wanna play TFT all the time! xD So, you guys really should keep TFT as a permanent thing because, honestly if you don't, it'd be one of the biggest mistakes you guy could make. There are plenty of people who are joining League just for TFT, and plenty of people who are stopping playing regular League and now ONLY playing TFT, so taking it away would push them away too, I'd think. \r\n\r\nAnyways, that's an essay right there, huh? Thanks for reading this far if you guys have, and I'll see you on the...Board? What's that thing even called? :thinking:","replies":[{"poster":"Flemman","date":"2019-07-10T05:57:05.566+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"For me, my 2 biggest problem are:\n\n- Kassadin being good into anything (shouldn't gain shield from aa manaless champ), I would love him to be change a bit. Also some clarity about the 10sec cd on his ability could be usefull, what does it represent in the end\n\n- carrousel system feel frustrating when, even if you it's your turn to pick, you miss your key champ because he was on the other side. Just hope that, in some patch, when it's your time to pick you are teleported at the center of it, giving everyone same chance\n\n_(Smaller problem, I would love a mute button for LL/emote spam^^)\n_","replies":[{"poster":"Porglit","date":"2019-07-11T00:44:04.368+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Flemman,realm=EUW,application-id=RaE1aOE7,discussion-id=lsJfocei,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2019-07-10T05:57:05.566+0000)\n>\n(Smaller problem, I would love a mute button for LL/emote spam^^)\n>\n\nThis is not a small problem.

Not every sorceror has to use mana. While Kha'zix isolation bonus is neat its a bit overkill the dmg they put on it while Veigar when he isn't hitting a champ that's lower level than him hits like a fluff ball when it should still be a relatively large nuke considering how squishy he is by comparison and that he's a 3 cost unit.","replies":[]},{"poster":"YambrinZ","date":"2019-07-10T05:35:23.139+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Varus is terrible in this mode, I can not therefore take anything you said seriously :p","replies":[]}]}
