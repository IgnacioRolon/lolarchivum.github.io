The problem is called the birthday paradox in probability theory if you're interested.\ntl;dr: In a room of 23 people there is a 50% chance at least two will share a birthday. In a room of 70 people it's a 99.9% chance.\n\nIf we assume there are 900 skins you can get through Hextech crafting, you are more likely to have a duplicate than not, once you get more than 35 skins/skin shards. At 23 skins it's a 25% chance, at 14 it's a 10% chance. Skins you have bought outside of Hextech Crafting further increase that probability.\n\nIf anything it would be an indicator for broken rng if you **weren't** getting duplicates.","replies":[{"poster":"Hethalean","date":"2019-05-11T10:02:07.297+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I forgot the statistical formulas to calculate this for myself, but 50% chance seems high.

That doesn't mean there's a 50% chance to receive a duplicate on exactly your 35th skin shard.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-05-11T07:28:58.265+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem with randomness is that you technically can't tell whether it's broken through mere observation.","replies":[{"poster":"Hethalean","date":"2019-05-11T09:58:38.612+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"True, the only thing to do is report it when you have a suspicion.
