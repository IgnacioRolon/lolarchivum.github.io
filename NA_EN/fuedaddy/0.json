Did they just get lucky in NA?_\n\nChampionship points. Besically they got a free pass because they made finals in spring and got enough points in summer to get instalocked into 2nd seed. A stupid system IMO because they were not impressive during summer and showed during World that they were not good enough to be there. They sould have gone to Play-ins at the very least to prove their worth.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Full Brain","date":"2018-10-19T11:22:20.748+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That grex/100t match felt like it was a comedic opening act performed by bronze players they put together to warm up the crowd for the fnatic/invictus match.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pika Fox","date":"2018-10-17T13:16:49.037+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Theyre what? 2-4?

They did the best that they were able to do with the talent they had, so I’m glad for that. Had they of lost to G-Rex that would have been really disappointing. The real embarrassments were actually TSM and Echo Fox. Had they of performed better over the past year we would have probably sent a team with the potential to do something in that group. \n\nIt’s one thing to lose against teams like fnatic or IG, it’s another to lose to Clutch Gaming in a best of five or, perhaps even more embarrassing, for a team with Huni and Dardoch on it to not even be able to make top four in the summer split. \n\nI would throw spring split Cloud 9 in there as well but they only lost to TL in the playoffs so I won’t really hold that against them too much.","replies":[]}]}
