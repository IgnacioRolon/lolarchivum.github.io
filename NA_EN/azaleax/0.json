Not every mage can reliably stack up Tear in a respectable amount of time. By the time they get Seraph's, the game will be over lol. Not to mention the fact that if you buy Tear as your first item, you're losing pretty much all of your offensive potential in favor of pure mana regen. You have zero early/mid game power.","replies":[{"poster":"foinhas","date":"2016-04-11T20:42:55.905+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">But don't you see that as a problem?\n\nI said that as joke, ofc it would be problematic\n\nHonestly, i'd rather wait for the rework to come out before judging it.
