For anyone i have annoyed or hurt i know this is s *supposed* to be a fun mode. I get annoyed *playing* matches were even if i win Ive been totally useless in lane and match.  I cant help wanting to not feed. I cant help wanting to at least have one kill. I cant help not being in lane because i'm dead at spawn because i wanted to feel like i did something and made a mistake or tried to hard. I'm sorry i have to vent because if i don't i internalize and have a good chance of hurting myself either physically or emotionally.  I know i can play something else or another mode but honestly i love league to much to play something else most of the time. I love URF but i hate feeling like im always fucked because of a lack of control i love URF. I FUCKING HATE ARURF!","replies":[{"poster":"fatherdarius","date":"2020-01-24T05:37:39.392+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"When I start to internalize, I drink.\n\nNow, I'm not advocating alcoholism.\n\nI'm just suggesting that a little bit of vice before a match can 'take the edge off' of the day and makes league even more relaxing and fun. \n\nWhat's your vice? Do you subscribe to the great god nick-o-teen? A cigarette, cigar, pipe, or some tasty e-juice? Smoke some herbs? Imbibe a bit of ethanol? Rail some cocaine like Mitch? Gey frisky with your partner (or yourself)? Watch some videos filled with lust, bloodlust, or even some George Carlin?\n\nMy point is, don't JUST do league. Too much of anything isn't necessarily a good thing - league included. Use it as part of an entire relaxation _system_.\n\nYour psyche, your body, and your karma will be better for it.\n\nNow, go in peace and feed no more.\n\n{{sticker:fiora-cool}} ","replies":[{"poster":"Nightsky Pirate","date":"2020-01-24T07:59:43.777+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm an ex-pirate and I endorse that message.\n\nOtherwise there are some significant issues with this OP I'm gonna go ahead and point out, because you essentialy said \"I know I shouldn't say this but I feel entitled to.\"\n\nIt might be harsh but western society generally does not accept blaming the environment (I can't speak for others) and is part of the reason suicide is not endorsed. You don't get to blame the system for _your_ problems, because you know what you're playing.\n\nIf you hate ARURF, don't use your emotional response to it as a reason for it being bad.\n\nVenting belongs in the Venting.\n\nIf you're not having fun and you're using that as justification for self harm, by God or by your Country, start taking care of your self. You are your responsibly. Don't fail us in this.","replies":[]}]}]}
