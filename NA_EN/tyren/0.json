Midlaners generally ward the bushes on either side of the river, so Q-ing over a midlane wall to avoid those wards usually works out pretty well.\n\nUse boxes to help in the jungle, to screw with the enemy in their jungle or to provide/prevent escape in teamfights.\n\nUse your Shiv (E) AFTER your Q.\n\nShaco's ult is good for splitpushing and doing burst damage in a gank or teamfight. Only use it when pushing towers or facing an enemy champion.\n\nShaco's my favorite champ, but do your best to end the game early if you get fed. He can 1v1 just about anyone lategame but can only get 1, MAYBE 2 kills in teamfights before dying. He's not a great jungler to \"carry\" lategame.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tyren","date":"2015-02-25T15:33:07.194+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks guys.

Shaco's passive gives you more damage if you stab people in the back with your AA and there's a damage bonus for AA-ing right out of the Q, so the way I usually do it is this:\n\nQ into lane, AA them from behind (while invisible, revealing yourself), immediately W (box) behind the enemy to cut off their retreat if they have a slow enough reaction, then E to slow them down while you stab them in the back while they run back to safety. It'll be tempting to turret dive, but don't take the bait - one of the best parts about Shaco is his potential to only die once or twice in the game. It's beneficial to burn a laner's flash or even make them go back from a gank, especially in the early laning phase.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"tkmteam5158","date":"2015-02-25T15:16:08.123+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I definitely recommend that you check out  Shaclone on Youtube, or NightBlue3 on twitch.
