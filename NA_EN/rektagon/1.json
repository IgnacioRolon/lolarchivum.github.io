On the abilities themselves they're pretty good overall, but I think there needs to be a way for Zur'Goth to heal. Perhaps if he kills a unit he heals himself for a small amount, doubled against large monsters and minions and tripled against epic monsters and champions? \n\nOn the abilities themselves, I'll go through them specifically.\n\nQ: Seems fine, but the cooldown should be a lot shorter if it's not going to have any CC or do a lot of damage. Perhaps also make all enemies hit get inflicted with a debuff that makes Zur'Goth's next attack do bonus damage against them.\n\nW: I think this would work better as the main CC ability, make it a moderate delay instead of a smaller one and the ability can be more powerful in order to zone enemies into fighting Zur'Goth as well as acting as peel for Nenetl.\n\nMy idea would be after a moderate delay, Zur'Goth conjures a volcanic eruption at the target location, knocking up and damaging enemies caught in the initial eruption. Lava will continue to spew from the site of the eruption for 3 seconds afterward, slowing and damaging enemies that remain inside every 0.5 seconds. \n\nE: I can't say I like this ability, it's extremely telegraphed CC when used on Zur'Goth and the requirement of only being used on champions below 10% health is way too situational. \n\nI think it would be better if this ability was some form of mobility for Zur'Goth which could also work as slight peel for Nenetl. My idea would be this:\n\n**Infernal Onslaught:**\n\nCost: 70\n\nCooldown: 18/17/16/15/14\n\nRange: 600\n\nZur'Goth engulfs himself in flames and charges in a target direction, dealing physical damage and slowing enemies hit for 1 second. Zur'Goth leaves behind a trail of fire as he dashes that remains for 5 seconds. Enemy champions or epic monsters that come in contact with the trail of fire are lit ablaze and take magic damage every second for 4 seconds.\n\nCharge Damage: 40/85/110/135/160 + (40% bonus AD)\n\nCharge Slow: 20/25/30/35/40% \n\nFire Trail DoT Damage: 2/2.25/2.5/2.75/3% (+ 0.5% per 100 bonus AP) of target's current HP \n\nR: Not terrible, but I don't like abilities that are just gaining stats. It doesn't need to change too much, but if you went with my idea of Q marking enemies so Zur'Goth's next attack does bonus damage against them I'd change it so Zur'Goth only gains 10/15/20% bonus move speed, and it's doubled against enemies marked by Q. Increasing the duration to 8 seconds would probably also be better if Zur'Goth is meant to be tanky at all and good in extended fights.\n\nIncreased AD for Zur'Goth instead of cooldown reduction would also work better when it comes to late game since you'll probably want a lot of CDR anyways to effectively peel for Nenetl. Also, not sure about the Mercy part. It could work but I'm not sure if Zur'Goth is intended to be closer to a diver or juggernaut.","replies":[{"poster":"Rektagon","date":"2019-08-26T09:54:39.851+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">This concept looks pretty damn good, though you should probably include the cooldowns for all levels because it looks like you're only showing level 1 right now.

Ornn's is a line that slows enemies, then creates a pillar at the end that remains as impassable terrain. My idea would be a moderately sized AoE with a moderate delay that knocks up enemies caught inside and then slows and deals damage to any enemies that inside.\n\n> The reason it is only 10% is because otherwise, she would just be able to banish enemies at decent health in laning phase, making her very difficult to trade with.

I mean, there'd be little point since he has to be close to Nenetl for him to cast in the first place, so having him dash onto something might not work as well as having him stay leashed but gain MS moving towards the target.\n\nIf you banish and recast very quickly, would it still be telegraphed? A lot of CC is predictable, and ideally the AoE would be large enough in teamfights to cause major disruption.","replies":[{"poster":"Meme God Shrek","date":"2019-08-26T23:55:28.780+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Rektagon,realm=EUW,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=pEP0RvJE,comment-id=0001000000000000,timestamp=2019-08-26T23:27:19.943+0000)\n> On the second part, lowkey, I don't really want to give them mobility - I'd prefer to keep the duo dashless and blinkless for the time being, what with so much mobility on the abilities of my other champions (including an upcoming support with sacks of it!)\n> \n> What I might do is give Zur'goth a movement speed bonus in the target direction, so it can function *like* a dash, but not cross terrain.

I suppose there's that alternative, but he already will be gaining MS with his ultimate so that would be a bit redundant. \n\nI understand not wanting to give too much mobility with the mobility creep LoL is experiencing like Pyke having a dash, MS and camo and blink that resets on kill, but I don't think giving Zur'Goth a dash would be too much of an issue personally. Nenetl will be very vulnerable since Zur'Goth is the one gaining stats from items for the most part, so being able to quickly re-position Zur'Goth in order to peel for Nenetl and attack enemies that try to assassinate her is pretty important. Without that you'd either have to keep Zur'Goth close to Nenetl at all times in a fight to make sure you don't get jumped, or send Zur'Goth into combat and actually impact the teamfight while Nenetl is left extremely vulnerable.","replies":[{"poster":"Rektagon","date":"2019-08-27T13:24:31.465+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meme God Shrek,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=pEP0RvJE,comment-id=00010000000000000000,timestamp=2019-08-26T23:55:28.780+0000)\n>\n> I see now that I misunderstood what you meant with E, I was thinking they'd be banished, then you can unbanish them at a target location making the target blink.

I agree with your criticism that it's currently a bit bland; just giving him stats. On first cast he would empower himself with the Hellstorm, and on second cast he'd dash to the target location, knocking back all enemies hit and stunning them for a brief duration. Nenetl herself is very fragile so this would allow Zur'goth to peel for her against an invading assassin, while preserving the unique CC found in Twisted Emergence.","replies":[{"poster":"Meme God Shrek","date":"2019-08-28T01:51:10.056+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Rektagon,realm=EUW,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=pEP0RvJE,comment-id=000100000000000000000000,timestamp=2019-08-27T13:24:31.465+0000)\n>\n> How about I put the dash in his ultimate?

On top of Zur'Goth probably doing good damage that would be a knockback into a stun, which could be followed up with Eing Zur'Goth for a 2 second knockup. That sounds like at least 3 or 4 seconds of straight CC on multiple targets, and most of it can't be cleansed.

It could be made something akin to Lissandra's ultimate where you can re-activate it immediately for the buff, but you could also keep Zur'Goth banished for a few seconds and he heals over time while banished.\n\nMaybe edit your OP so people have a better idea of the current kit?","replies":[{"poster":"Rektagon","date":"2019-08-29T21:32:18.380+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meme God Shrek,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=pEP0RvJE,comment-id=000100000000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2019-08-29T20:55:35.942+0000)\n>\n> That actually sounds perfect, and when it comes to healing for Zur'Goth having it on his ultimate could work too.
