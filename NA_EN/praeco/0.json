Kindred was his first project, and we&#039;re all very excited to have him on our team, writing music for you all in the future.\n\nWith him, our team now consists of the following vagabonds:\n\n- **Sebastien &quot;Chemicalseb&quot; Najand** (His work includes the themes of Ekko, Braum, Urf, Super Galaxy Rumble, Rek&#039;Sai, Bard, PROJECT, etc.)\n- **Alex &quot;Scherzophrenia&quot; Temple** (His work includes the themes of Bilgewater(including map music &amp; champion themes), Snowdown 2014, Tiny Masterpiece of Evil, Tales of the Rift, etc.)\n- **Jason &quot;Protoshredanoid&quot; Willey** (He also joined our team somewhat recently. His work includes the theme of Tahm Kench, Pentakill &amp; eSports music contributions)\n- **Edouard &quot;Ed The Conqueror&quot; Brenneisen** (As mentioned, Kindred was his first piece for us)\n- **Myself, Christian &quot;Praeco&quot; Linke** (My work includes the themes of Nami, Diana, Jinx, Vi, Amumu, etc.)\n\nTogether, we work on all musical aspects of League of Legends. We all have different and musical styles and backgrounds that we try to utilize intelligently for all the different projects that we tackle, and one of the awesome aspects of working on this team indeed is being able to learn from each other every single day.\n\nIf you have any questions, feel free to ask us whatever you&#039;d like.\n\nAlso, for the curious, the awesome dudes from surrenderat20.net already uploaded the theme, which is currently on PBE: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVtvPXVysiE\n\nThanks,\n\nChristian // Praeco","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2015-09-21T22:13:54.608+0000","up_votes":95,"down_votes":5,"body":"You want to know what I think?\n\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/4a34031ccbc06ec685b35fe4521a2500.gif","replies":[{"poster":"disregardable","date":"2015-09-21T22:16:50.573+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":24,"body":"harsh man\n\nkindred's theme is awesome. well done to the newbie!","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2015-09-21T22:17:53.001+0000","up_votes":54,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's me unchecking it, not checking!","replies":[{"poster":"disregardable","date":"2015-09-21T22:19:58.044+0000","up_votes":40,"down_votes":0,"body":"o rip.

One of the first things we looked at was what kind of instruments it should have, and whether there should be a \"featured\" instrument (in the way the Nyckelharpa is for Freljord). We decided that rather than focusing on one instrument, we could capture the melting-pot feel of Bilgewater better by using a variety of different instruments \"imported\" from other parts of Runeterra, brought together with some questionable playing techniques to make some unsophisticated noise at a pub down by the slaughter docks. The next question was, what should that ensemble sound like? \n\nA lot of the \"percussion\" that you hear in the track is quite literally what you might hear in a Bilgewater pub: it's recordings of mugs being slammed down onto wooden tables that I later cut up and assigned to keys in a playable MIDI instrument. Some of the other non-MIDI instruments were chosen based on what was available, which in hindsight I think fits the spirit of how a Bilgewater ensemble would be assembled. We brought back the same bouzouki that chemicalseb used all over Braum's theme, but after traveling all the way from Freljord we thought it shouldn't sound that great. To fix this, I tuned it down almost an octave to get a loose, nasty twangy sound from it. I also bought a cheap Mandolin for the project, and while I do my best to play it \"correctly\" on many parts of the tracks, I think we actually had much more interesting results when I played it with a violin bow. I thought of it as the sound of a drifter with a bit of mostly-forgotten fiddle technique bartering his way into possession of a mandolin somewhere in Bilgewater, and trying to play it like a fiddle because in his addled mind, it looked kind of like one. You can hear this in a lot of the drones, like the ones that begin most of the logins and the champ select music. The voices are a bunch of Rioters having a little too much fun for a Monday afternoon. We'd considered doing lyrics but concluded that it would be too distracting for in-game music.\n\nMusically, I thought everything should be simple and unsophisticated - the kind of music that would be picked up through oral tradition rather than properly learned. Thematically this meant straightforward rhythms with a lot of note repetition and a lot of stepwise motion (moving up or down by just one note rather than in larger leaps). I developed all of this in the map music first, and then later extracted and re-purposed the themes for the various logins. We actually work this way on a lot of our projects, where we might do a promotional video first, and then expand certain elements into the login. (For example Shurima, Ekko, Freljord, and Summoner's Rift were all done this way.) This often is due to project timelines more than anything else, but it also works in our favor, because it can be tempting to get carried away while working on a standalone login and write music that will be harder to adapt for a more time-locked format. \n\nI have been meaning to get the rest of the music up onto Soundcloud, sorry for the delay! I'll try to get it up this week :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Dragon Fang Shot","date":"2015-09-22T15:50:39.918+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In university, were you guys composition (or at least some kind of music) majors or minors?","replies":[{"poster":"Ed the Conqueror","date":"2015-09-22T16:48:40.857+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was a Jazz performance major :P","replies":[{"poster":"Dragon Fang Shot","date":"2015-09-22T18:10:10.054+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What instrument was your main focus?","replies":[{"poster":"Ed the Conqueror","date":"2015-09-22T18:42:05.318+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=FrigidVengence,realm=NA,application-id=aAJWt2b9,discussion-id=748EyQOB,comment-id=004500000000,timestamp=2015-09-22T18:10:10.054+0000)\n>\n> What instrument was your main focus?\n\nFor \"Kindred\" i'm pretty sure it started with singing the melody, so that part of the creative process wasn't really slaved to a particular instrument.
