And as Knockwurst pointed out in his Maokai VU art video, they now do specific parts of each splash art, which means a splash art can have 3-4 artists working on it. This is why art spotlights arent a thing anymore, because getting the recording from each separate artist is hard to do.","replies":[{"poster":"Shíny","date":"2015-04-24T15:11:22.634+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is true, everything at Riot is a collaboration,but just as a champion's kit is the work of the champion design team but usually has one lead on the project, so too is a splash art's composition mainly  the work of one individual.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"S H A Y C 0","date":"2015-04-24T14:32:01.663+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sooooooooooo......that just became my desktop background :P","replies":[]}]}
