Most players needed to choose a new username that was different from their Live Account to use on the PBE servers. If you can't remember what you used, try hitting up our account agents in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).","replies":[{"poster":"Snake122591","date":"2017-10-19T09:54:40.936+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is indeed the correct username. I have sent you guys a ticket in response to not being able to sign in. Unfortunately the response I got from support was nothing helpful. They sent my email with a password reset. I didn't ask for a password reset. In fact if they had even read the ticket I told them that I reset my password and hoped that it would change. That didn't help. It's like my ticket was skimmed and thought it was a password problem.","replies":[]}]}]}
