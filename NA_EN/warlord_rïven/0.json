If you know you can rebind it to that key, let's go ahead and try resetting your config settings to see if the source of the problem is lying hidden in there somewhere.\n\n- Log into the game client\n- Navigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\n- Delete the file  named **game.cfg** and **persistedsettings.json**\n- Go into a practice game and verify that settings have saved properly. \n- Leave game to sync settings","replies":[]}]}
