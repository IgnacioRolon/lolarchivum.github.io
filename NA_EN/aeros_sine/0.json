What interested me was that Morgana was a baker and when my friend gifted me a mystery skin and Sinful Succulence Morgana was the skin I got, I was told this.\r\n\r\nSo I read on the wikia page for the skin that she now has a food cart in Noxus. I would like to know, what does she bake? Does she still bake now or did she give it up?","replies":[{"poster":"Carnival Knights","date":"2018-04-11T17:59:46.623+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sinful Succulence Morgana now exists in an alternate canon where she's an (in)famous confectioner, working with and against other celebrity chefs.","replies":[{"poster":"Ult√Æma","date":"2018-04-11T18:26:06.199+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Morgana vs. Pantheon bake-off event when Rito?!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lintu Puck","date":"2018-04-11T01:08:52.965+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"She did in the old lore, but her cart was either eventually closed or she quit for some reason.\nSince the lore changes (i.e. when the Institute of War no longer was a thing) there hasn't really been much talk about Baker Morgana and neither her nor her sister Kayle have really had much of any changes since then. They probably won't see story stuff until their VGU in their future, which will be a double pack as Riot wants to give them their updates together.","replies":[{"poster":"ReisenTheDos","date":"2018-04-11T19:32:42.655+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"With the exception of Pentakill Kayle.
