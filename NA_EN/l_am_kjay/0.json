(e.x. Gold in Season 3 >> Silver in Season 4)\r\nIf you don't play ranked for a season, does it completely reset?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-03-25T21:47:59.899+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Whenever a new season starts, you _do _ need to play your placement matches again but your new rank is calculated based on your old rank plus how well you did in your placements. \n\nWhile we do take your old rank into account, your new rank may be higher or lower than your previous one depending on how well you do in your placements.","replies":[{"poster":"l am Kjay","date":"2017-03-27T00:33:22.188+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you so much!! :D","replies":[]}]}]}
