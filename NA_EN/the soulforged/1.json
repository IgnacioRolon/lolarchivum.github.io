No, I won't blame the guy for trying to defend himself. Some kid came out of nowhere possibly trying to mug him.\n\n\nHOWEVER, this guy just shot a kid and was WHISTLING!  I don't care about the circumstances that Piltie found himself in. He was whistling Dixie after shooting someone and leaving them for dead.  If you consider Ajuna or Ekko the bad guy in that situation, then you obviously don't get the concept of what it's like living in the gutter.","replies":[{"poster":"IcyPepper","date":"2015-05-22T09:27:10.507+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"If he was sobbing up a storm and cradling the poor kid after realizing the shot was fatal, then he would have been a sympathetic character.\n\nShame he lived.
