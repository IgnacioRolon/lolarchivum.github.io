These two subjects normally have nothing to do with each other. When I look at the story and art board, I see two types of threads of which are lore threads and art threads. If I want to look for something lore related, I should go to the story and art board, but there is so much clutter from the other subject, it kinda makes me feel like I should just go back to browsing GD or something. I'm sure it must feel the same way about people wanting to browse the art boards. \r\n\r\nThese are completely different subjects, so can we separate them into separate boards?","replies":[{"poster":"JedenVojak","date":"2015-02-02T04:16:43.526+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"For them to go through the the trouble to do that, there would have to be Lore in the first place.\n\n{{champion:82}}","replies":[{"poster":"The Soulforged","date":"2015-02-02T05:55:40.817+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JedenVojak,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=Pei23GzN,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2015-02-02T04:16:43.526+0000)\n>\n> For them to go through the the trouble to do that, there would have to be Lore in the first place.\n> \n> {{champion:82}}\n\nI cry, because it's true.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"The Soulforged","date":"2015-02-02T00:30:38.663+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be fair, we get no information on lore on this board.\n All I see is the art team actually taking in input and talking to the community like IronStylus.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chromatic Eagle","date":"2015-02-01T22:12:03.969+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you want them to virtually ignore lore fans?

However, there are certain parts of the Institute of War retcons that need to be clearly defined before they can continue with their  lore (Freljord and Shurima have been their current focues as they were never notable parts of the story until Ascension and the Three Sisters storylines. Also Gnar, Zac, Jinx, Yasuo, and Zyra are all examples of safe champions for them to release lore-wise-- their \"lore\" is generally a minor internal conflict within the city-states and/or are dissociated from pre-existing city-states.)\n\nIf there was to be a story forum, trying to figure out the Institute of War story conflicts (Ionia/Kalamadas/Journal of Justice/Judgements) and rewriting the lore for summoner-related champions (Fiddlesticks, Ezreal, Taric, Kayle, Morgana, Zilean, etc.) would be desired before discussions about the lore on it's own forum were to happen.","replies":[{"poster":"Motajo","date":"2015-02-02T05:40:12.349+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=quazymoodo,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=Pei23GzN,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2015-02-02T00:31:41.472+0000)snip\n\nThere wouldn't be anything stopping those discussions from happening on a lore-specific forum.
