Reversing your best change to Ahri ever?","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":60,"down_votes":22,"body":"OKAY REWIND TO SEASON 3. Fizz and Ahri are pick/ban choices in lcs. Both champions clearly need nerfs. In response, you cut damage off of Ahri's abilities and added the +20% damage boost to Charm, because you wanted to, and I quote:\r\n\r\n-Make Ahri’s “all-in” gameplay more closely tied with landing Charm to establish Charm as Ahri’s “kiss of death” that needs to be avoided, as well as lower her threat/presence while Charm is on cooldown\r\n-Keep Ahri’s core gameplay intact while trimming away strength from the low-gameplay patterns that don’t feel rewarding\r\n\r\nI liked this change a lot. Instead of getting bursted by Ahri with DFG and  various little lights that gravitated to me just because I was close by, I had a clear-cut choice that if I could dodge this one, narrow skillshot, I could survive the rest of her burst. There's something about getting hit with a max range skillshot that makes me think, \"I deserve to die here. I couldn't dodge x ability even though I know I could have, so this seems like a balanced, fair way to die.\" The change made laning as and vs Ahri far more interesting, and now you're REVERSING EVERYTHING YOU'VE DONE. So now I'm thinking, deep breaths man, you can get through this. But as I scroll down...\r\n\r\n\"Pulling power from Fizz's basic spells and loading them into his ultimate makes sure skilled Fizz players can still slip in and take out priority targets, but now gives some room to breathe when he doesn't line up his shark-bait just right.\"\r\n\r\nUhhhhhh, what? You JUST removed the EXACT SAME DAMAGE BUFF off of Charm for Ahri! This almost looks like a paraphrase of the 3.13 changes to Ahri I quoted above. With a bit of editing...\r\n\r\n\"Pulling power from AHRI's basic spells and loading them into HER CHARM makes sure skilled AHRI players can still slip in and take out priority targets, but now gives some room to breathe when SHE doesn't line up HER CHARM just right.\"\r\n\r\n'Nuff said. Let's not go back to the previous state of Ahri.
