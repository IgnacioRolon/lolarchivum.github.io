The countdown for the enemy team to pick their champ stops at 0 and then I had the connection error. I couldn't pick my champ got a queue dodge timer and lost LP. Any way riot could refund my LP as this is the second time this has happened and I guarantee its not any hardware/software.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-07T22:15:06.888+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This freezing during champion select can be a result of connection issues cutting out or losing sync.  We aren't able to alter game stats or alter points, but I do suggest running through the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to help fix it up.  That should help prevent further issues from happening, though, test it in a custom to be sure.  Let me know if you have any questions!","replies":[{"poster":"MoooooKri","date":"2017-03-10T14:19:35.732+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hi,\n\nMany players have reported this issue without getting answer so first thanks for providing one at least. \n\nI have tested all the suggested solutions in the connection issue and nothing changes de problem.\n\nBtw i have noticed that everything works fine in blind mode or in custom. The issue occurs only in draft mode or ranked.\nI have completely stopped trying to play in ranked i already lost enough lp and i try a draft sometimes after updates but 3 games on 4 fails.\n\nthis started with patch 7.4 but became dramatical with the 7.5. I suspect some google chrome script to be causing this.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-10T16:49:17.137+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry to hear the guide wasn't able to help.
