But as an effort to bring this community closer together, I kinda want to see people share their best memories of this chaotic gamemode.\r\n\r\nOne of my favorite memories came at about the last possible second URF was still open. AP Ezreal with my buddy who was playing Sona, and an enemy Sona was going through our jungle, I ult towards enemy Sona, and one-shot her with it... Her reaction was \"That was dumb.\"\r\n\r\nAny great memories you have of URF? Share them in this thread.","replies":[]}
