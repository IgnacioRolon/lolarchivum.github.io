HATE is controlled by Dirk Anger, seen commanding the drop bears be dropped, and unlike Nick Fury, who can live forever due to the serums he's drunk, Dirk seeks the ultimate way to kill himself, and always fails miserably.\nNextwave is composed of a drunkard who gets more powerful the drunker he gets, called The Captain. It also has Aaron Stack (aka Machine Man), Monica Rambeau (aka Captain Marvel, aka Photon, aka Spectrum), Tabitha Smith (aka Boom Boom), and Elsa Bloodstone. They fight such enemies as Fin Fang Foom (wearing purple pants) and Devil Dinosaur. They also have no fucks to give.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
