None of our other friends disconnected so we thought it was an isolated incident since it only happened one time. Today, however, the same friend and I simultaneously disconnected again twice in a row and later a third friend from the same area disconnected as well in another game. It's been less than an hour and we've disconnected three or four times. Our friend from San Diego wasn't affected at all so I know it has to do with our local area. What is happening and is there something that can be done?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-24T22:55:35.920+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Would you mind running a traceroute for me really quick so I can get a clear picture of how your connection looks coming to our servers?
