My bad I didn't format it fully (it was still having Windows 10 which I used on Laptop). It a little bit bugged my OS. I had to reenter FolderDescriptions registry records (couldn't cut-paste or rename folders) and do clean installation of .NET and nVidia Driver (GTX960 STRIX here). They were in the newest possible versions of course. Since then I can't run LoL new client. Error (below) occurs every time I launch new client (after double-clicking on icon or from legacy Launcher). I made up workaround for now (RADS\\system\\user.cfg: leagueClientOptIn = yes -> no) to use legacy client (no problem with it), but Riot is going to discontinue support of it, so I need a solution.  Any ideas how to fix it? I tried all my own and failed.\n\nThanks in advance,\nMark00s.\n\n//Error translated to English\nLolClient.exe - Application Error\n\nThe instruction at /* memory cell ID */ referenced memory at /* memory cell ID */.The memory could not be ''read''.\n\nClick on OK to terminate the program\nClick on Cancel to debug program (I can debug it in Visual Studio)","replies":[{"poster":"mark00s","date":"2017-03-06T16:38:05.516+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fixed.

The error you've mentioned usually only crops up if an installation of League has gone wrong. I recommend reinstalling Leauge by following [**this guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202539040-Reinstalling-League-of-Legends) to a T, including installing League to the default directory of C:\\Riot Games.\n\nLet me know if this resolved your error.","replies":[]}]}
