When you report someone, the IFS looks at _that person's behavior alone_. Reports don't \"backfire\", because they don't look at the behavior of the player filing the report - they look at the behavior of the player being reported.\n\nIf you wind up getting punished, it's not because a report you filed somehow \"backfired\" - it's because **you broke the rules _and_ someone else reported _you_.**\n\n> and the rest are left in the dark.\n\nThis is similarly untrue; a report is only ignored and discarded if the IFS finds no punishable behavior in a review. Just because a player didn't get punished (as though you'd ever truly know who did and when), doesn't mean they didn't suffer _some_ repercussion for their misbehavior.\n\nIf a player breaks the rules but doesn't warrant being punished by a chat restriction/temp ban/account ban, the IFS instead applies an Honor penalty (slowing/removing their Honor Progress for the match in question) and nudges them closer towards the point where they actually _do_ warrant being punished for an offense.","replies":[{"poster":"Salty Mc Feed","date":"2020-01-13T08:56:35.276+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> another dozen are backfired causing the reporter and not the reported to be punished\n\nWhile this causality is obviously not there, the system still sets players up so that they report each other.\nIt happens all the time that players launch a series of salty reports against their team mates after losing a game and/or having a little chat disagreement and then only 1 side gets banned.\nThis happens because it's a common habit to use reports like a weapon.\nIt's basically like punching someone after an argument because you were not able to convince them.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Leaf on Bush","date":"2020-01-12T21:44:49.633+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":7,"body":"That noob Lee Sin who missed 2 Q's in a row lost us the game and losing makes me very uncomfortable... so i guess I report that player? \n\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}}","replies":[]}]}
