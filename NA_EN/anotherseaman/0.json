I couldn't log back in for long without disconnecting and repairing didn't work so I had to reinstall. However, when I started reinstalling and the process got to 1%, a message occurred saying \"There has been an unspecified error, check your logs for more information.\" after which it closes the program. I've attached the crash logs, and I need help with what to do next, seeing as how I could not find any solutions.

Later on my client became so buggy i could not log on and not crash the client. Not sure why this happened. League has been working fine for me for over a year on my new laptop and then all of the sudden, this happens.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-04T19:27:22.618+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bugsplats usually occur from bad drivers or game files failing to load the game, so reinstalling likely resolved that.  At 1% the patcher is trying to scan your game files to prep for updates but something is blocking it.  Go over the steps in the [permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) guide to resolve that unspecified error.
