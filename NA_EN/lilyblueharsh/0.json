Constant ping spikes of over 5000 ms and \"Attempting to reconnect\" every ten seconds.  It was so bad in my last game that I couldn't even CS properly.  I had to disconnect because I just do not have the superhuman patience required for this.  And the real kicker is that it was a top-lane between Volibear and Shaco.  SHACO TOP LANE.  I would have easily won that lane and most likely won the game if I could stop disconnecting for all of half a second, but that just isn't happening.  And it's not my connection - I've done ping-tests repeatedly and none of them are showing any of the jitter or connection problems I'm getting.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-05T17:43:48.097+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lag spikes and input delays are usually due problems with your network maintaining a connection to the game server.  I know you feel that might be the case, so I recommend running a [log reader](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743-Connection-Troubleshooting-Log-Reader) which will get an overview of what's going wrong.
