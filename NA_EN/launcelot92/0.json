For an example ark Ultra 1440p while streaming i get 70 to 90 FPS most of the time. However on 1440p streaming at 30fps 720p i only get 40 to 52 FPS in league. I have the FPS capped at 60 FPS I also have everything set to very low predictive moving off. If I have the stream off i can barely pull 60FPS in league. \n\nSpecs:\nCPU: i7--8700k\nGPU: geforce gtx 1080ti\nram: 16gb corsair\nHD: 254 gb sandisk SSD\n\nSeems a bit inappropriate considering my specs any advice is appreciated other than, your PC is too good you can never play league again. I watch my GPU usage and as soon as league launches it spikes to around 100% I have tried patching restarting and changing drivers.\n\n**edit** Stats for my utilization and tempatures are as follows when in fountain in a custom with OBS running a stream at 30FPS\nSettings 1440p all options verylow\nCPU tempature in each core verys from 45C to 54C\nCPU utilization in each core spikes at about 31%\nall 6 cores are clocking in at roughly 4322-4421 MHz\n\nGPU is clocked at 1962 MHz if i'm reading it correctly for the\ngraphics memory is clocked at 5508 Mhz\nGPU is utilzed at 97-100%\nGPU Memory is at roughly 10%\nFrame buffer video and bus interface are all staying less than 20% utilization\nGPU tempature staying around 55 to 60C\n\nThis is while in fountain in a custom game only me.\n\nEditing original post to include this**\n\n** got more info edit \n\n\n  Motherboard Model:                      MSI Z370 GAMING M5 (MS-7B58)\n\nRam is 2 sticks at this  Total Width:                            64 bits\n  Data Width:                             64 bits\n  Device Size:                            8192 MBytes\n  Device Form Factor:                     DIMM\n  Device Locator:                         ChannelA-DIMM1\n  Bank Locator:                           BANK 1\n  Device Type:                            DDR4\n  Device Type Detail:                     Synchronous\n  Memory Speed:                           2133 MHz\n\n\n\n","replies":[]}
