For some reason my internet (in the Bay Area, CA) is having horrible lag to the Riot servers.

I don't know why the hell they are NOT widely addressing these issues. Guess they care more about having fun in China then fixing the game for the masses.\n\n(You know how hard it is to play a skill shot based champ and ur FPS (not ping/ms) goes from 70 to 11? Worse then the game lagging out, even though it looks like ur lagging!)","replies":[]},{"poster":"DirtyBirdy1991","date":"2017-10-31T01:04:58.176+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same, I've been getting stupid lag spikes all throughout my games, like characters will perform actions and I won't see the results until seconds later.","replies":[]}]}
