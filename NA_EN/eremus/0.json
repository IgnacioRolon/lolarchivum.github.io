Sad!","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have been trying to play my beloved game, League of Legends for weeks on end; each time I try to log in, I am unable to log in, stuck on AUTHENTICATING after I type in my credentials. My friend across the hall in my dorm, also is having the same problem as me, being stuck on AUTHENTICATING. I, myself not having access to my wifi because it is our dorms wifi, am unable to even reset the router or find out what may be the root of this issue. Please for the love of god help me, I'm having withdrawals from this game; I need this game more than Lindsey Lohan needs meth, or Robert Downey Jr. needs crack cocaine. \r\n\r\nThanks Fellas,\r\n-eremus","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-13T21:51:29.610+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your troubles might be stemming from your campus wifi, that is already struggling from immense user traffic.  You can try the steps in our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to help, but your best bet would be to try a wired connection as well as reaching out to campus IT.  They should be able to configure their settings to make sure players can reach the game server or other services.","replies":[]}]}
