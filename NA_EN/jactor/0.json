So lets say i get placed in gold for ranked 3v3. But lets say im in silver in ranked solo/duo. When i play a game, which border would show, the gold border or the silver border? If i play a ranked solo/duo game after the season ends, will my gold border from 3v3 show or my silver border from solo/duo?
