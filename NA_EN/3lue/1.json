In higher Leagues that might work if your team demonstrates that they have proper map awareness and a focus on objectives, and are buying a ward or two or at least dropping one Pink per person. In low elo that isn't going to happen, and having as many wards as possible on the map gives your team vision of things they're going to miss otherwise. I can't count how many games in Gold that I've solo'd Dragon or invaded the other side of the map because their support and laners didn't buy any kind of vision for the river or jungle entrances. You can't rely on your team to have an idea where the enemy is, and having a lot of vision control can set up picks or prevent people getting caught.\n\n> Offense > defense, the only defensive item that affects other people is aegis. Everything else can be dedicated towards offense (or defense if you're a tank). It's also easier to win with glass cannons than tanks that do no damage, so keep that in mind.\n\nFrozen Heart, Randuins, Mikhaels, Frozen Fist, Ardent Censer, Face of the Mountain, Talisman, Frost Queens. All affect other people either in your team or on the enemy one, and all are viable depending on what Support you're playing. In many cases building some defensive items is a much better idea than offense. I pick up a Iceborne after Sightstone if I'm ahead as Sona many times, and it can be incredibly useful. Armor, CDR, Sheen Proc, and Slow all synergize with her kit. I honestly would take it over a Deathcap 4/5 times due to the utility it offers. Many \"support\" items can have a huge impact on the game.\n\n\n> more wards =/= better, by buying wards, you're throwing away your advantage.\n> \n> In fact 5 trinkets should be all the vision you need, thus you don't even need sightstone.\n\nAgain, disagree. The more vision you have the more easy it is to get picks, take objectives, and avoid being caught. Especially in lower elos where map awareness falters.\n\n> The easiest way to climb for me at least - play solo bot lane, exile the support/adc to another lane.\n\nIf I see an ADC sending their support off to help another lane, they're as good as dead. I'm going to ward deep since I know there's no support to stop me, and either that tower is going down or I'm asking our jungler to come down to dive and murder the ADC as often as humanly possible. If I see the ADC shift lanes, I'm going to shift you that lane as a support and let my own ADC enjoy that sweet Exp and Farm while the enemy support sits alone bot lane doing nothing productive for their team.\n\nIt might work sometimes, but a smart support is going to abuse the hell out of you for it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ZaganJustice","date":"2014-11-04T05:34:33.997+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> >What do you do when people do not listen to you when you try to guide them and ask them to buy at least 1 ward/pink ward?\n> \n> more wards =/= better, by buying wards, you're throwing away your advantage.\n>In fact 5 trinkets should be all the vision you need, thus you don't even need sightstone.\n\nlol, that ryan choi logic","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"StOrmysLIVE","date":"2014-11-04T21:53:43.317+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've had plenty of low elo support games where people would just not listen- all I can do in those situations is stay around to try and help them survive, and abandon them when it inevitably fails.\n\nNow if it was a cohesive listening team, I would suicide myself in that situation to help others escape.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jackedup86","date":"2014-11-04T21:03:40.944+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In my opinion the best way to carry a game with support is to be as positive as you possibly can. Never rage at other players, always praise your team mates for good plays and communicate objectives and opportunities in a friendly and positive manner. You will be surprised how much a friendly player can reduce stress and prevent further mistakes when a player knows they made a mistake. Of course this will not prevent players from purposely feeding.\n\nIf you are doing well in your lane then take the tower and extend your warding to cover not only dragon but the enemy blue/red (depending on the starting positions). This will allow you to pressure the Jungle and mid safely while simultaneously allowing you to push bottom and contest Dragon.\n\nIf you can force the Jungler or enemy Mid to pay attention to what you are doing it opens up a lot of opportunities for your Jungler to make plays top and Mid and really open up the map for plays.\n\nThere are also supports that can build damage to replace a carry it the opportunity or need arises. Sona can be a beast when built pure AP as well as Morgana, Annie and arguably the new  Soraka kit. Other supports can also have a huge impact in fights without having a lot of damage to take objectives, such as Leona, Blitz and Thresh can set up ganks really well or land clutch ults to entirely turn a fight around.\n\nWarding for the correct circumstances is very important as well. If you are slightly ahead early in the game a little bit of aggressive warding in the enemy jungle can give you the opportunity to isolate a jungle champ at an objective and get a kill putting their jungler behind while simultaneously providing your ADC with a buff in lane. If you are behind you can freeze your lane by your turret and use the extra wards you would use to ward your lane to defensively ward your jungle to provide protection for your jungler from invades.\n\nBasically supports are all about the small changes that will help your entire team \"carry\" the game rather than assuming direct control of the outcome.\n\nThere will of course be games in which you will lose but if you can tip the scales just a little bit you can win more game than you lose and advance.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Chin","date":"2014-11-04T19:52:40.405+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What do you do when your ADC is fed?

Most games there's always things you could have done better that might not have thrown the game.

If you think they're in good spots then you've got 3 minutes of good vision. \n\nTBH the biggest thing you probably need to work on is your communication. \n\nIt sounds like your main issue is people don't listen to you. If you're really trolly and negative, people won't do what you say. You should ALWAYS be encouraging when talking to your teammates and they'll almost always listen to your calls.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vauren","date":"2014-11-04T18:31:45.273+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Support/jungle main here, in Silver V after completely skipping bronze promos from like 56ish LP in Bronze I. I don't play a whole lot so I'm not any higher :( Not the most credible, I know, but hoping to help regardless.\n\n>**\"What do you do after you get your ADC fed? I assume you roam and ward when you know your ADC is safe, correct?\"**\n\nShort answer, yes. I roam and place wards provided my adc and turret are safe. I deny vision where I can safely too.\n\n>**\"What do you do when 3 wards of your SS have already been placed?\"\n **\n\nThen I place a pink ward that I bought last time I went back hoping to get vision on a key jungle route or objective or deny enemy vision.\nIf you have 3 wards placed already, then you have 3 wards out already. There isn't anything else you can do with it really. You could go back and refill, but you'll still have one or two wards left once 3 minutes have gone by to place. While the wards are up you should be helping your team and supporting them to help secure kills and objectives. \n\n>**\"What can you do when your tanks allow assassins and other carries get through your back line?\"**\n\nIt depends on which support you are playing really. Tank supports should peel, damaging supports should deal damage and try to out kill the assassin, passive supports should heal or use other abilities to hinder their goals. Try to not separate from your team too much if you can help it, then you will have 0 chance of help from teammates if they have a sudden change of heart.\n\nItems can be used as well for situations just like this. Face of the Mountain, Locket of the Iron Solari, and Mikael's Crucible can all be used to help deal with damage; while Talisman of Ascension, Randuin's Omen, and Twin Shadows can be used to try and disengage, dodge skills (Talisman only), and create breathing room to work with. \n\nYour job in lane is to make sure your adc is on par with the other people in the game who are fed/ahead by making them ahead or fed through your awesome support prowess :D So whenever things like this happen, the edge an ability or item can give will let them come out on top.\n\n>**\"What do you do when Dragon and Baron is available and your Jungler goes and smites wraiths? (Tristana and I duo'd 2 dragons and 2 barons - when we could have had at least 5 dragons all game.\"**\n\nThe reality of it is, you can't do every single job as support. If you try and do other roles than support, than the support role on the team is lacking which is no good either. Going off and getting Baron and Dragon by yourselves is just fine provided you have the vision to do it safely, or their jungle is dead at least.  You could ask them to save smite for Baron/Dragon by pinging and saying it'll be up in a minute. Otherwise, nothing you can do.\n\n>**Do you build offensively when you know you have to pick up your team's slack (when you know there is zero hope of them finishing out the game) or do you keep building defensively?**\n\nAgain, depends on which support you are. For tanky supports, I might build a hybrid item if we really need more damage. For Damaging/passive supports, I will absolutely build some damage if needed once core support items have been built (SS at the *very* least.) Most supports scale with ap, which will increase support capabilities and damage so no real loss here.\n\n>**What do you do when people do not listen to you when you try to guide them and ask them to buy at least 1 ward/pink ward?**\n\nNothing to be done. If they don't listen they don't listen. Don't rage at them for sure or blame them, that'll just make things worse. You could try to carry extra wards so you can place them as needed (don't need a drag ward when pushing for inner turret).\n\n>**Are some games just totally impossible to win after one, or two lanes feed like nobody's business?**\n\nPossibly, but don't give up. Keep trying and learn how to work in a bad situation. \n\n\nIt is a **team** game after all; enable your allies and hinder your opponents, if you do that well enough, you can carry your team.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord OwlBear","date":"2014-11-04T08:33:48.068+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay my comment is going to be a cheap one, low elo {{champion:53}} is king. {{champion:201}} when he is available.
