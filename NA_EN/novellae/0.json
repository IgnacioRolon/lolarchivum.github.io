Now it never actually SAYS disconnecting, it just goes to an absurd amount of ping and everything freezes in the game for a few seconds; then of course it catches up by super speeding everyone around the map. I also cannot issue new commands during this \"disconnect\"/\"ping spike\" state. \n\nI could reallllly use some help on this if you guys could spare some time to look into it. I'll try to find your tracert instructions so I can link them for you.\n\nThanks again\n\nEdit: after trying a lot of the things on your troubleshoot connections guide, it looks like flushing the DNS worked. I'll keep an eye on it to see if anything else comes up, but for people having the same issue give it a try.\n\nEdit2: Nope, still a problem after DNS flush. Done everything I could do on the troubleshoot connection list. None of it worked. I'm at a loss as to what I can do.\n\nThese are the reults from Netalyzr(which no longer works with chrome btw):\nMajor Abnormalities\n–\n\n    Your DNS resolver returns IP addresses for names that do not exist\n    Your DNS resolver manipulates results for IPv6 addresses \n\nMinor Aberrations\n–\n\n    Certain UDP protocols are blocked in outbound traffic\n    The network latency was somewhat high\n    The time to set up a TCP connection was somewhat high\n    The DNS resolver may have problems with DNSSEC\n    Your DNS server accepts unusual glue records \n\n","replies":[{"poster":"Dark Morgana","date":"2015-11-09T19:21:22.299+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Novellae, \n\nWith the amount of ping issues you're having and with your computer freezing you may want to try Riots Connection KB.
