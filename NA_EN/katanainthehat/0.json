The steps below will assist you in completing this.\n\n>- Shut down all computers connected to your home network (modem/router/gateway).\n- Power down/unplug your router, if you use one.\n- Power down/unplug your modem.  Have both devices off for at least 60 seconds.\nNote: If your modem has a battery backup you will need to take the battery out for 60 seconds or use the reset button on the modem.\n- Turn on your modem and allow it to completely boot up.  Wait until the indicator lights on the device stop blinking and display a steady green connection.\n- Turn on the router (if you have one) and allow to completely boot up as well.\n- Start the computers and allow it to completely boot up and re-establish an internet connection. \n\nLet me know if your network goes down again.","replies":[]}]}
