So they went all agro on me so I popped my R and W and in less then 5 seconds the announcer shouted PENTAKILL and everyone on my team was flipping out since it was a solo 1v5 pentakill and I was Rammus of all champions... Well enough bragging I&#039;d like to hear of the communities stories of their best Pentakill they have ever got?","replies":[{"poster":"ReshiKillim","date":"2016-01-15T03:06:19.615+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My best Penta ever was as Karthus, back at the start of S5.

It wasn't an all at once 1v5, but I did have to like a Panthion and Shen mid, then Roam into jungle to pick up the last three kills.  I have like 5hp after the fight.  Hourglass and W are the only reasons I lived through the stuns of Panth and Shen.  R.I.P.
