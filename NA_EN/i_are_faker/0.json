Riot Games, if you&#039;re gonna ban people who verbal abuses other people, like one of the topics in the reporting section, ban the people who actually call others stupid, idiot, moron, and etc,. I don&#039;t understand.","replies":[{"poster":"RallerenP","date":"2018-07-30T19:57:49.729+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> So... calling someone an idiot doesn't ban people\n\nIt does. But calling someone an idiot in a single game wont get you punished. The system targets consistency, not just one-off comments.\n\n> and having a bad day, accidentally and not purposefully dying is bannable?\n\nIt's not. **Intentionally** feeding is punishable. Feeding in general isn't.\n\nIf you got falsely punished for inting, submit a ticket to support. They will take an extra look at the game to see whether or not you were indeed just having a bad game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-07-30T19:54:20.880+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The reverse, typically. logs or gtfo.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Aneirin","date":"2018-07-30T20:10:13.189+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> ban the people who actually call others stupid, idiot, moron, and etc\n\nLike...
