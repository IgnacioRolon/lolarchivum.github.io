You guys dont give a shit about the people actually ruining games, all you care about is the people &quot;verbally abusing&quot; others.

You'll see some of the most up voted posts have been complaints about the way Riot currently handles things. I remember making an angry thread about a lack of Clarity in the game that got several hundred upvotes.\n\nThe difference is how it's worded.\n\n\"Rito always knows who is going to AFK and troll and puts them into my promos\" doesn't hold much credibility. Yes, it can happen, but if Riot knew who was AFKing and Trolling they'd punish them, not match them with you.\n\nDetecting Trolls in a quick and accurate manner so they get punished is the trick. We know it, Riot knows it, the trick is actually figuring out how to do it. Fine tuning the language detection system (which is already built, almost fully configured) isn't going to make a dent on the troll detection system (basic version works, but tons left to configure). It wouldn't surprise me if some of the programmers that would be working on that actually got pulled off to work on the new Client, so it'd make more sense to say \"Rito, stop fixing bugs that force me to dodge and find trolls!\"","replies":[{"poster":"SCgargari","date":"2016-09-16T22:28:12.340+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Doc, all jokes aside, wouldn't it be better for Rito to acknowledge some of the more legitimate complaints about ranked than to pretend they don't exist? I mean it can't be good for business if Riot is pushing people like me away from the game could it? There is nobody more passionate than me when it comes to mobas and competitive gaming. It's what I live for and to push me away just doesn't give me confidence that they are going to be around in the long term which is a shame. I really loved this game. I think it was my love for the game more than anything that made me feel compelled to speak up about certain things that were making ranked play very not so enjoyable for me and my family friends that played league.","replies":[{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2016-09-16T22:42:14.189+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> wouldn't it be better for Rito to acknowledge some of the more legitimate complaints about ranked than to pretend they don't exist? \n\nWhat do you think has been going on this entire season? \n\nChanges to matchmaking, restricting Dynamic Queue to lower elos, and adding Remake are all changes based on legitimate complaints this season. You could even argue the Queue Preference badges are based on legitimate complaints from this season (not handled the best, but still based on them).\n\n10 bans coming next season and the new client (no more dodges due to client bugs) are based on acknowledging legitimate complaints.\n\nJust because they don't get to fixing everything (or don't think everything needs fixed) doesn't mean they're not acknowledging it.","replies":[{"poster":"SCgargari","date":"2016-09-16T23:02:17.757+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's fair enough.
