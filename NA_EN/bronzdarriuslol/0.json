The only fix I've found is to uninstall and reinstall. Even that, however, is not always effective. Sometimes I need to uninstall and reinstall multiple times before I can load it up and play. I've tried closing out my firewalls, I've tried closing single, multiple, and all league related applications - including rads_user_kernal. Nothing works except for uninstalling and reinstalling - even that only works for that one session; once I log out I cannot log back in. \r\n\r\nI'm using:\r\nWin 10 64 bit\r\ni5-6600 @ 3.3GHz\r\n16gb ram\r\nAMD Radeo R9 390 @16.4.1 sofware version\r\n\r\nWhat do I need to do to fix this. It is very frustrating waiting hours for the patches to finish downloading every time I want to play.","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-05-19T21:45:57.163+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is something I have seen a few people post about, but it seems more recent of an issue.  When you close League of Legends normally, is there any instance of League of Legends running in your Process List at all that shouldn't be given you closed it down?
