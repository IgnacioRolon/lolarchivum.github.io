Now we'll try to patch it up to the latest version.\" I hit OK and nothing happens no patch in the corner or anything\r\n\r\nWhen I log in however, the Play button is greyed out and when I scroll over it a little window pops up saying, \" We aren't able to create a lobby right now. Please exit the client and re-open to try again.\"\r\n\r\nI have re-opened the client and still the same issue occurs. I have also ran the repair tool and it has found nothing wrong.\r\n\r\nAny advice or directions to advice would be most appreciated","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-06-07T16:47:16.656+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You could be having an unstable connection problem that's struggling to get you updated or reach the matchmaking services.  Running the HRT is good, but mostly focuses on game files and not network.  I suggest going through the steps in the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to strengthen your connection and remove any potential blocks.  You can also use the HRT to auto-configure your firewall settings!  Let me know if that helps.","replies":[]}]}
