Going and playing passively because you see your ally Shockblade Zed creeping up on a Champ and warning him not to because you think it's obvious as you see brown and green, when in fact he could have gotten the kill because his white color blended well enough with the WHITE SNOW that it gave him that slight edge over his opponents, is pretty much a great reason as to why this will never happen. He obviously isn't invisible, but because his white color blends in well enough with the snow they are slightly less accurate.\nMainly: color tactics are just as important in League as the Fog of War in terms of visuals. People seeing different colors than others alters perception between those players, essentially creating hidden or unpredictable advantage/disadvantage which absolutely ruins the game. Not to mention that the game would essentially be running two different versions of the same game at the same time (since you're making it an _option_ and not manditory...you're complaining about lag now, just wait till your toaster tries running two different versions of Rumble in a teamfight against the likes of Zyra or Zac or Jax.\nJust.

NO.\n\nThere are custom maps out there and riot dont mind it, why would they mind having an option to turn off the snowdown themed summoner rift? On top of that, the skins that would give that \"slight advantage\" in the new summoners rift are mostly snowdown themed skins, and skins shouldnt give advantage to the players since that would make it \"slightly\" pay to win.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Jhinsecure","date":"2016-12-30T11:41:48.001+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ikr i'm not having this problem but my friends are and its really annoying to not play with them.\nI hope next time riot will fix this.\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Aaytrox","date":"2016-12-27T11:34:15.333+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It Just looks bad xD {{summoner:32}} {{summoner:32}} {{summoner:32}} {{summoner:32}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"CinamoniukeRawr","date":"2016-12-27T09:39:03.907+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's killing my eyes as well.
