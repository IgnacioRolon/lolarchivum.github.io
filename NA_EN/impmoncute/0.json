Why?","replies":[{"poster":"fancyassgrits","date":"2017-02-19T08:42:41.274+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"OLD LB does more damage in one second, but in average time new LB does more damage; OLD LB relied heavily one QRWE, when the cooldown of mimic Q was around 40 without any CDR. This made her quite unhelpful in team fights because if she fails to burst down the ADC then she had to be defensive until the old R came back. Not to mention that the old R only copies last non-ultimate spells, so she was very hard to deal with as adcs or sqishy champcs, but had little creativity unlike her \"deceiver\" status. However, the new LB can put bursty deal in every 5 seconds after passive proc giving higher damage overall, but her passive delay offers counterplay from enemies.  that's why she is \"healthier\" for enemies now. \n\nSome people who suck at LB complain how clunky she has become, but if you think about it, not many assasins have her level of mobility, mind play, and burst. Here are some examples of why:\n\nZED: Zed kit is heavily reliant on his shadows and ult, and while he can goback to his orignial position like LB, he can't use it as frequently as LB's W(Distortion). Also, after he lands his ult, if the team bombards him with CC, then he is pretty much dead. \n\nDiana: Oh she can kill you in 1.5 second, but she too has to use her R to ensure one shot kill. A good Diana will land Q on enemies and rush R to them, but good enemies won't let that happen either. All you have to do is to keep distance from her. \n\nFizz: One of nastiest champ in LOL. His ult gets bigger with distance, his on-hit damage is insane. However, his entire damage kit too much depends on his E(playful/trickster), and without him, he is a free kill.\n\nKatarina: She has zero CC and her ult is CHANNELING. Need to say more?\n\nKassadin: He counters many AP champs and has stupidly versatile mobility that rivals LB, but his passive is completely useless agasint AD champs, especially Zed, remade Talon, Panth, and Jayce.\n\nShaco: Invisibility can you only get you so far. Yes it's annoying but vision and CC are way to go. Also, his burst is weaker than other champions, and he has to put much more efforts of \"preparation\" to catch the enemies off guard. \n\nAkali: Her ult and spellvamp is monstrous, but she has pitiful CC and even more susceptible to CC. \n\nThere are other examples, but you can see that LB is the only primary assassin that can:\n1)**poof back to her original position with basic skill**\n2)**can create clones in regular basis for split second mind play**\n3)**can deal massive damage in safer range**\n4)**range autoattack**\nThis makes her easier to assassinate the enemies in a blink of an eye, and the old kit only made her even less possible  for squih champs to make any counter play.","replies":[{"poster":"Sir Fuzzi","date":"2017-02-19T11:53:10.305+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Anything that requires adding thinking as part of gameplay will invariably receive one of two things; quiet praise from those who enjoy thinking over speaking, and loud complaints from those who enjoy speaking over thinking.","replies":[{"poster":"fancyassgrits","date":"2017-02-19T16:54:36.923+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Sir Fuzzi,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=0gtZb3To,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2017-02-19T11:53:10.305+0000)\n>\n> Anything that requires adding thinking as part of gameplay will invariably receive one of two things; quiet praise from those who enjoy thinking over speaking, and loud complaints from those who enjoy speaking over thinking.\n\nYeah, people complaing about LB, but they should be complaining about Annie really. Her kit is a no-brainer. Just spam 4 skill for free stun and her Q refunds you mana and cooldown.

I think that balances her lane phases enough.

Even when you see what's coming, she will still take a chunk of your health because of her speed. \n\nBut there is something worse than her E.
