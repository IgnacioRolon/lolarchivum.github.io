Even bard is arguably better.\r\n\r\nKarma has no niche. She lacks damage to play solo lanes and lacks enough utility to be a succesful support. \r\n\r\nArguably on the current state of the game she may be quite good. She is afterall a strong early game duelist, up to lvl 4 she is arguably one of the strongest champions in the game and as we have seen games are often decided in the first 10 to 15 minutes. However this is preseason and things will change in these next two months and likely not in karmas favour.\r\n\r\nAs to how karma should be changed i am unsure, though i do believe she needs to bevome either a true utility support similar to lulu and nami or become a pure damage solo laner.\r\n\r\nPlease leave your thoughs guys","replies":[{"poster":"IxtaliKing","date":"2015-11-20T11:03:42.799+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree, she could do with a more defined niche.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Aeolian Melodies","date":"2015-11-20T01:55:32.785+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol she does not lack damage.

She is also a fairly safe pic thanks to range and is good waveclear.\n\nKarma has to get up close to do damage which wull open herself up to either getting bursted down or cced (unlessn ofc you want to use your cds on the tanks). And no the movement speed from e will not stop you from getting focused.\n\nTwo that fill a similar role to karma are viegar and annie. Both mid range bursters.\n\nAnnie has a flash tibbers in her pocket and can 100 to 0 any squishy. \n\nViegar does the smae but he can 100 to 0 a tank.\n\nLissandra is another similar mage but she is used to shut down mobile assasins.","replies":[{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-11-20T04:46:17.939+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Then I'll show you Annie's abilities...\n\nAnnie's Q, 220+80%.

Can she be CC'd and killed? Yeah. So can EVERY mage EVER. Annie is also considered a short range mage where-as Veigar is considered an anti-Mage. Not a certain-range burster. No. Veigar is an anti-mage, though he's more of an anti-squishy since his ratios, while not the highest in the game (60% on Q, 100% on W, 100% on R, totaling 260% which is high, but LB does much, much more surprisingly.), it's still enough to murder most squishies, especially with the AP boost he has as his Q's passive.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Aeolian Melodies","date":"2015-11-21T07:45:16.856+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ace 1n your hole,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Zgq7eFhb,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2015-11-20T02:06:44.620+0000)\n>\n> Yes she does more damage than most supports early.
