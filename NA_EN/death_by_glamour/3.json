Most assassins knew that if you took away reliability at killing a target who has complete reliability at killing opponents, it tends to be bad.  That is largely due to ADCs inherently having their own problems though that honestly require a full rework to make them more kit based, and as such, outplayable, than right click based.\n\n2.  There are 5 basic types of utility Assassins can healthily offer a team comp without breaking their purpose as an Assassin (AKA good capability to kill isolated squishy targets).   I'd say it is fine for them to have 2-3 types of utilities generally.\n\n\nA.  Fishing.   Fizz is about the only fisherman assassin (Oh the irony), with his long range ulti being a good tool to try and fish for a pick.\n\nB.  Roam.   The capability to roam across the map and catch isolated targets out is very valuable.    Eve, Kha'zix (with R evo), Kayn, Talon, Kassadin stand out for this.\n\nC.  Waveclear/pushing power.   The capability to carve though a minion wave can be a utility for an assassin, especially if it is paired with a high degree of safety.   Kayn and Ekko are the most notable safe waveclear possessing Assassins, although Zed's clear is fairly solid as well.  Noct can help contribute to some safe-ish clear, but can't do it solo.  (Shadow) Kayn is definitely king though on the Waveclear front, with extremely long line waveclear that can not only 1 shot casters, but even 1 shot melee minions.\n\nD.  Teamfight potential.   Most assassins innately are weaker in teamfight situations, but some can be allowed to be stronger than the average in them, usually through resets or bulk AoE damage.  Katarina and Talon stand out in this, and Leblanc can kite frontlines fairly well as well.\n\nE.  CC.  Needs to be more conditional/easier to avoid with longer cooldowns than most other classes, but Assassins can bring CC to a teamcomp.   Fizz and Ekko are notable on this front.  Noct's R is a powerful utility in a teamfight that can sow panic for a few seconds if you can split the enemy team up, and his fear can help with a single target if they can't break the tether or otherwise nullify it's impact.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Death by Glamour","date":"2018-04-05T19:17:27.649+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":4,"body":"Talons roam isnt a new thing, kassadin amd kata have been doing it since season 2","replies":[{"poster":"Steelflame","date":"2018-04-05T20:03:15.422+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":2,"body":"Kata's roam is just because she likes double kill situations, her kit contributes nothing to roaming, unlike what Talon or Kassadin bring, which is actually skills that enhance their ability to roam through boosted mobility and the ability to cross several walls.","replies":[{"poster":"Death by Glamour","date":"2018-04-05T20:09:15.879+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":6,"body":"Not now but it used to","replies":[{"poster":"Steelflame","date":"2018-04-05T21:46:23.461+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":1,"body":"Even in the past her kit didn't really do much for roaming speed.

It was obvious to me and I was saying it, at least, and the thread got pretty popular at the time.\n\n2) Steelflame gives a few good examples and in general Assassins need to be able to play the objective game better with more emphasis on Waveclear and Roaming, but since he's already laid out the basics I want to go on a waaay more abstract and theoretical route. I can summarize in one sentence really: the presence of that specific Assassin must change the state of the game. I also want to say that I use the term \"Utilities\" far beyond common examples like what type of CC they have or their Waveclear potential. I use it more like a champion's \"niche\", but not exactly. It will make more sense once I give some examples:\n\nIf I give you a simple Juggernaut like Mundo or Volibear, champions that have good structures in terms of their sub class but have exceedingly little personal utility, well you'd treat them like Juggernauts but you wouldn't really treat them like Mundo or Volibear. Compare this to Illaoi. Even as a Juggernaut, she has gigantic utilities between her big AOE potential, her E, and a fight changing Ultimate. If I say you're fighting a Juggernaut, your thought is \"okay kite and Grievous Wounds\". If I show you Mundo or Voli, your thought is \"okay kite and Grievous Wounds\". If I show you Illaoi though, your first thought should be somewhere between \"Don't get hit by her tentacles\" and \"Fucking move\". For a combat class champion, she doesn't even need to kill anybody to radically change the state of a given game. Assassins need to take this note.\n\nThe following 3 champions are the ones that I think truly exceed in this distinction, Evelynn, Katarina, and Kayn.\n\n{{champion:28}} - Perma-Stealth, or Camouflage at least, is a mechanic that changes the entire nature of the game. Unless you are extremely crafty, uniquely so in such a way that really only Evelynn demands, she throws the entire map and your vision control into flux. It doesn't matter if she's even actually good at Assassinating as Old Evelynn proved, just the fact that she's in the game and you know she's in the game changes everybody's behavior around how you can't see her coming.\n{{champion:55}} - There's no other champion in the game that really compares to the AOE potential that Kat has, except maybe Illaoi. Entire teamfights are won and loss off her daggers and resets, and if a team does not respect Katarina and does not do what they can to keep her offline, she makes them pay for it. Hard.\n{{champion:141}} - Everything that Talon wants to be and more. Not only is his mobility ridiculous for roaming distances, he actually has the kit (and role) to fully utilize it. When playing against Kayn, players need to respect how he's capable at coming at you from any and every angle. This is on top of his Unique form mechanic and strong fundamentals like his Waveclear potential.\n\nVirtually every other Assassin either doesn't achieve this effect at all, or has the potential to but we don't get to see it. As two quick examples, LeBlanc fits the former and Talon the latter. LeBlanc changes nothing about the game. At most, she'll scare somebody with her Ult clone (Hi Shaco) but there's literally nothing else that changes how you should react to LeBlanc than any other theoretical generic Assassin. Talon has the potential to be a ridiculous roamer and him being MIA should be a death flag for basically anybody because he can be anywhere on the map. Except, his kit isn't very conducive to achieving that ideal since his waveclear is sub par for the likes of Mid Lane to the point that he literally can't roam if he falls behind at all.\n\nAs a side note you can run this test on other classes and start to see what I mean. Many individual Juggernauts fail to change the game outside the fact that they're Juggernauts; Garen, Volibear, and Mundo do this the absolute worst. Dive Fighters too actually, if you can macro around Wukong you more or less do the same thing to Jarvan or Xin Zhao. Assassins are just the worst at this as a subclass though; so few of them get to express their idividual utilities that they all homogenize into a boring mess or an entire broken subclass.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hyrum Graff","date":"2018-04-07T15:04:04.954+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=KempyreanPirate,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=yacMUAmt,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2018-04-05T19:06:04.192+0000)\n>\n> 2) Can you elaborate on the types of utility you think could be used to distinguish between assassins?\n\nIMO, all assassins must have the ability to burst a single squishy target, else they aren't assassins. The big distinguishing factor should be what happened before and after the assassination. Here's some examples to clarify:\n\n## Before the kill\n\n- Eve's stealth gives her really unique angles of approach, though she pays with the long arm time on her charm.\n- Talon's wall jump gives him unique pathing to find a flank.\n- Fizz's troll pole makes him one of, if not the only assassin who can go straight *through* the frontline (debatable whether this is healthy).\n- Nocturne has the longest-range engage (also debatably healthy).\n- Kat's resets mean sometimes her path to the backline is by helping kill the frontline first.\n- Rengar's ult provides some unique positional gameplay.\n\nI'm not saying they're all well-designed champions as a whole, but I do think they are from the perspective of setup for a kill. In contrast, Akali, Diana, Kassadin, Shaco, Leblanc, Zed, Kha'zix and Ekko all do kind of the same thing: find a flank and dash onto the carry. And yes, as I'm sure someone will point out, some of those are better than others.\n\n## After the kill\n\n- Kat's resets allow her to make unique contributions to teamfights.\n\nEveryone else kind of sucks moose juice in this department. Old Leblanc was the classic example of this problem: she'd get kills and snowball hard, but since her *only* strength was getting kills, she couldn't close out games and her winrate sucked (except in competitive, where they're much better at turning kills into objectives).\n\nWhere's the assassin who's good at seiging? At taking neutral objectives? At DPSing towers when uncontested? At securing or denying vision? These are the main things I'd like RIot to think about when they get back around to updating assassins.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Akali is SO HOT","date":"2018-04-05T20:11:05.545+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":1,"body":"Katarina's rework was really good and Talon was pretty decent as well.

The rest were pretty lackluster with Rengar and Leblanc being the worst and Fizz and Akali being pretty bad too.\n\nI think the problem with Katarina's rework is that despite it adding skill expression to her kit, and making it so she is actually strong early game, the rework ultimately failed to solve one of her main problems: Katarina is still extremely snowbally and unstoppable once she is ahead, but when she is behind, she offers nothing to a team. Compare for example, to Nidalee or Kha'Zix. When they are behind, they can still, at least (respectively) heal her teammates or slow multiple enemies (with an evolved W). All that Katarina has is damage; if she is behind, she is useless. However, if she is ahead, she will murder your entire team because she has insane AoE burst damage with resets.\n\nEveryone praises Katarina's rework as if it was perfect, but on my opinion, all that Kat's rework did was make it so that she is at least not infamous as a braindead champion.","replies":[{"poster":"Terozu","date":"2018-04-06T00:11:58.512+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thats less a problem and more her entire identity as a champion.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JMoormann","date":"2018-04-06T09:04:31.060+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd argue that the rework made it (somewhat) better, as she is no longer 100% reliant on getting a kill to get out of a fight.

The double standard here is just absolutely fucking insane.\n\n1 \n\nfirst of all, what is the assassin's job? it is to be very mobile and to deal single target damage in a bursty way.\n\nthe assassin's job is NOT to score a kill and escape. \n\ni.e. the assassin is defined by what they are supposed to perform, not what they are desired to succeed at. \n\n2\n\nThe problem with assassins one-shotting a target immediately following a long range traversal skill  is that the one-shotted target is not receiving any (fun) gameplay. Generally speaking the \"avoidance\" game play patterns (stay with team and support) are also not fun to play out. \n\nAdditionally, if the damage is immediately following a traversal skill, most disables are not able to prevent the damage coming in. This is because for the assassin, the damage dealing is queued right after the jump, whereas the support has to generally have a target or location for whatever disables he's got, and therefore can only cast them after the arrival of the assassin. \n\nTherefore in most cases disables are not functional against an assassin if the assassin is able to 100->0 a target immediately following a traversal skill. \n\n3\n\nMost assassin characters are given at least one skill that can out-tempo (= be faster) and \"trump\" an incoming skill. Zed's R, Fizz's E, Leblanc's dash are examples. \n\nI do think supports should not be about protecting ADCs from assassins. But as long as they are about that, they should have skills that allow them to \"trump\" an assassin's kit. \n\nI see this as fair because the assassin itself has these powers also. \n\n4\n\nIf you could re-design supports, what kind of alternative kit do you think supports should have in general? The skill set needs to be fun for the support player specifically to enact, not just fun for his allies to have nearby.","replies":[{"poster":"Hawthorn Tree","date":"2018-04-06T13:51:33.047+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Assassins kill the back line.

The player wants to independently influence the game and having to receive permission for every action from that person you just met kinda sucks. \n\nThe support has exactly the same issue. Enchanter supports are very versatile in what they can do in the game but if they have to keep their positioning and skills ready for the inevitable dive, than they are locked out of the parts of the game that are the most fun.  \n\nIt also creates a not very fun tug of war between the ADC and the Support player who may have differing ideas on what should be done for the benefit of the game, example the ADC wants to farm the bottom lane wave and the support would like to help with pressured mid. \n\nWhen an assassin jumps on the ADC and deletes him it is obviously not fun for the ADC. But the actions leading up to that point, the preparation and counter-actions that the ADC takes to avoid this situation, these should be fun for the ADC. Otherwise the game is full of un-enjoyable moments for the ADC player. \n\n---\n\nAs an assassin player, you need people to want to play classes that you can jump on. If these people, outside of the moment of you jumping on them, have to spend the game doing a bunch of not that much fun tactics to preempt you having your fun in the game, than maybe they don't want to play with you in this way. \n\nWhat they will do is switch roles; The will directly compete with you on who gets to play \"assassin\" and you will be auto-filled to the role of ADC and let's see how you like it there.","replies":[{"poster":"Hawthorn Tree","date":"2018-04-07T18:44:52.264+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The \"basis of the problem\" doesn't fucking exist, because there IS no actual problem.

Trust me, a 0/0/0 assassin with mediocre farm walking over wards to get to the enemy ADC is not going to be all that scary at all.\n\nif this is the case why do you play talon over jannna?\nJanna gives you a better chance to \"destroy someone else\". \nSo why do you play talon?","replies":[{"poster":"Hawthorn Tree","date":"2018-04-08T18:37:57.804+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol because I started in season 3 and back then assassins were actually playable.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"ZJD123","date":"2018-04-05T18:54:24.599+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":2,"body":"dont forget zed had to be repeatedly buffed after his atrocious change in the assassin rework that removed the bonus AD on his W.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Malak","date":"2018-04-05T18:56:41.075+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":3,"body":"They have to start by nerfing damage on ADCs, which are auto attack assassins and the reason why everything else has to be strong, then reduce damage across the board on tanks and assassins","replies":[{"poster":"Death by Glamour","date":"2018-04-05T19:08:44.821+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Damage from carries isnt only problem, also the sustain they have with lifesteal and runes","replies":[{"poster":"SpecterVonBaren","date":"2018-04-06T01:26:39.093+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I miss when building lifesteal was a conscious choice an ADC had to make rather than just being something they're handed to from their starting item and runes.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Dont Blìnk","date":"2018-04-05T23:07:08.519+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"Too bad the assassin update didn't account for the ADC assassins.","replies":[{"poster":"Somebody Love Me","date":"2018-04-07T08:45:15.371+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=The Locker Gnome,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=yacMUAmt,comment-id=0014,timestamp=2018-04-05T23:07:08.519+0000)\n>\n> Too bad the assassin update didn&#x27;t account for the ADC assassins.\n\nTwitch got buffed in the assassin rework and was broken for a straight year after that","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"IT3etlWEXJ","date":"2018-04-05T22:49:08.046+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Idk why they are reverting LB and Rengar their updates were fine...","replies":[{"poster":"Death by Glamour","date":"2018-04-05T22:51:18.755+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"idk about rengar but lb simply couldn't burst anyone before getting bursted herself","replies":[{"poster":"Terozu","date":"2018-04-06T00:12:33.552+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"Well thats not entirely true.

Just because their jobs are both 100-0ing squishies doesn't mean they play in the same way. Diana cannot get out once she's in, and this is a substantial difference between Kassadin and Diana (among other things).\n\nAnd as for counterplay, warding and tracking them on the map, and locking them down and bursting them are some general counterplay tips against assassins. You can also build resistances, since assassins generally like to build flat penetration.\n\nFor Diana, the dash can be interrupted, Q can be dodged, which denies her a second cast of her ultimate. Locking her down and killing her before her rotation comes back up is another option. Her dash range isn't absurdly long, so hiding behind frontline is also an option.\nFor Kassadin, tracking him can be more difficult, but still possible. He is very strong in the late game, and it is true that there's not as much you can do against him compared to other assassins. But he is weak in the early game, and can be put behind pretty far back. Mid game he is more slippery, but he also has a lot less burst than other assassins, and it is easier to survive him from full health.\n\nAnd if we're going back to the original point of having a class of champions who can 100-0 squishies, they are important and necessary, not just for fulfilling power fantasy. High burst is necessary to counter high DPS backline (typically ADC), and high DPS is necessary to counter frontline, and frontline is necessary to counter high burst, whether it's by soaking up the damage or preventing the damage through CC. If you think they're currently imbalanced, maybe you have a point. But high burst champions who can kill other glass cannons is crucial for League, as well as many other team based PVP games.","replies":[{"poster":"Khristophoros","date":"2018-04-06T06:54:24.532+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"hypermobile champs that 100-0 people in literally 1 undodgable rotation isn't a necessary thing.
