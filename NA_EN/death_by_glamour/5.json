How exactly does this solve her current issues exactly?\r\n\r\nshe still has way to much damage loaded onto her Q and RQ, no one likes that amount of damage on one ability, just look at zoe\r\n\r\nw is interesting as it may see some use with mages botlane but I imagine it will just make lucain OP sometime next season\r\n\r\nE bland and boring as ever\r\n\r\n\r\nwhat we wanted\r\n\r\nOld Q back so she can poke through those minion waves which is major issue with her currently\r\n\r\nthe old model (just the fans really), but ofc you kinda gave that to irelia\r\n\r\nshield bomb\r\n\r\ndecent lore, again you gave that to irelia\r\n\r\njust look at the effort you put into previous reworks and then look at this one","replies":[{"poster":"Frosted Tips","date":"2018-10-24T22:24:04.231+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"1. Fans - easiest that is why it is first\n2. Shield bomb - Most wanted thing to return\n3. Ally W - we got this but it is way too niche and will force her to have synergies with a few champions and be too useless on everyone else because the other users abuse it too hard.\n\nThat is what Karma players wanted and that was failed miraculously. This is by far one of if not the most disappointing gameplay update ever.","replies":[{"poster":"Edge of Daybreak","date":"2018-10-24T22:53:42.976+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah fans is just visual so sure why not. I dont think anyone would have minded them coming back.\n\nShield bomb was never coming back and I don't know why people believed it ever would. Karma was being picked in pro for just the shielding alone why would riot give it back the aoe explosion? Sure it would have been fun as hell to have it back but in no world did I even think it was a possibility.\n\nTheir w where karma spirit walks sounded awesome but new version is probably going to just be busted in some cases and get nerfed due to that.","replies":[{"poster":"Frosted Tips","date":"2018-10-24T23:05:08.095+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The shield bomb was being talked about so don't say it was never coming back.

Unless they massively dunked her in a way that made her feel bad for getting it back then maybe I could see it. TBH I kinda expected the changes to not be major because riot always tries to please 2 completely separate sides of the isle. I would be screaming bloody murder if she was anywhere close to her old self while players who wanted that are unhappy. Personally while I dont agree with the views of the other side I will say that riot basically didnt change much of anything here as her gameplay is going to basically be the same she just has more to do with W which isnt really much to show after all this time.","replies":[{"poster":"Frosted Tips","date":"2018-10-25T00:11:51.661+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First off there are three groups. Group A, insane people that only want Solo lane Karma, so Tank Karma and Mage Karma. Group B, imo the most reasonable group filled with mostly original Karma players that want Mage Karma and Support Karma viable even if the ratio for either side is 70/30. Group C, mainly filled with purely New Karma players meaning post rework Karma players that want her as a dedicated support. I would love to see Karma as a Support and a Mid lane champion but these changes don't help her mid lane at all which needs help and the changes only help her support role which is also in desperate need of help.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Death by Glamour","date":"2018-10-24T23:05:55.028+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"wasn't it because of the shield bomb counting towards her passive/ult CD reduction?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Tenth Leper","date":"2018-10-24T22:28:17.827+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I also miss the fans very much, though at this point I just hope they put in a new fan user champ.","replies":[{"poster":"Frosted Tips","date":"2018-10-24T22:29:43.077+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just don't get why they removed them and then after receiving tons of complaints they add them to her dance and now that they have a chance to right their wrong they decide not to.\n\nThey already have them on her models because of the dance.
