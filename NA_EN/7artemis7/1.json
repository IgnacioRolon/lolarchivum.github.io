ECommerce gets deep into a project (like worlds) and forgets the simple things that really keeps fans happy.\n\nFor example, Riot used to do a mega \"Black Friday\" sale.

The fact that you have to respond to lore threads, since no one else does, is a pretty big problem, since you aren't even a part of the lore department. \n\nWhile I respect your intent to keep communication open with players,  it's meaningless unless you have actual data to share.\n\nGet the lore team/narrative up and running again asap!","replies":[]},{"poster":"72897118DEL1","date":"2015-11-02T00:17:23.323+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Rito ignores this just like they ignore feeders","replies":[]}]}
