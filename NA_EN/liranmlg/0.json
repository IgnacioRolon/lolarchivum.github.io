This is probably gonna be long. \r\n\r\nSo, me and my friends decided to go out this evening, like we always do, we&#039;re all 15 and we learn at the same school so we always go out together. \r\nWe had a bit of fun and joked around. Talking about memes and what not. We even got a few snacks. \r\nWe were on the way home when a group of teenagers approached us. probably 16. one of them was holding an empty bottle of beer in his hand and I know it was gonna be bad. \r\nThey bumped into us and asked what was our deal. I said that nothing was up, And it was all good. \r\nthey continued walking and then they turned around. started kicking us in the back and yelling at us. \r\nwe tried ignoring them and walking away but they turned up in front of us. \r\none of them kept asking what was our deal and shoving me, two of my friends ran and it was me and my other friend. They shoved us and began kicking and punching us. Full on. \r\nthey broke my glasses and pushed me to the ground. Kicked me around while my other friends tried to stop them and tried to fight back. I pushed him back and signaled him to run. He ran and I stayed another minute getting beat the fuck up until i managed to get up and run away. \r\nI could&#039;ve escaped earlier but they would chase my friends so I stayed and delayed them for a minute or two. \r\nI got up, Punched one of them in the face and made a run for it. \r\nmy glasses were broken off of my face. But my other stuff were luckily untouched. I found my friends later and we made sure that everyone was ok. \r\nI got home and I had to explain to my mom what happened to my glasses and we&#039;re going tomorrow to get new ones made.\r\nFirst time this happened to me on this scale. \r\nThanks for reading, And feel free to share your own experiences. It&#039;s always good to know you&#039;re not alone.","replies":[]}
