I like to think of myself as reformed now, I don't cuss at players, I avoid flaming players at all costs, and I use chat to communicate and overall help myself and my team win the game.\r\n\r\nI received at bare minimum **3** reports this game, as I was heavily under performing and getting my ass kicked around by an enemy {{champion:5}}. My {{champion:8}} and {{champion:39}} told the other team to report me for being toxic, and my allied {{champion:523}}  also voiced that he planned to report me.\r\n\r\nMy allied {{champion:53}} very subtly near the end of the game told everyone they were treating me completely unfairly.\r\n\r\nSo here is the chat log, IN context.\r\n\r\nPre Game Lobby:\r\n    MrSísterFister: autofilled\r\n    MrSísterFister: mid.top\r\n    MrSísterFister: i can jg too\r\n\r\n\r\n{{champion:30}} \r\nIn Game:\r\n    MrSísterFister: power clearing unless i see free kills\r\n    MrSísterFister: they invading my blue\r\n    MrSísterFister: irelia?\r\n    MrSísterFister: ?\r\n    MrSísterFister: whats goign on lol\r\n\r\n**At this point i've been invaded 3 times by Xin Zhao, I wonder whats going on with all the invades**\r\n{{champion:39}}  **and** {{champion:8}}  **start to team up, telling me i'm trolling, telling me they're reporting me, telling me i'm feeding, telling the enemy team i'm being toxic**\r\n\r\n    MrSísterFister: xin kinda just doing whatever he wants lol\r\n    MrSísterFister: would be better if xin didn't kill me 5 times\r\n    MrSísterFister: okay?\r\n    MrSísterFister: i'm literally not trolling xin has been in my jungle the entire game\r\n    MrSísterFister: idk what you want me to do\r\n\r\n**Nothing constructive is being offered, and i'm starting to get hard flamed. {{champion:523}} now says hes reporting me and that the only way to win is if I played a different champion.**\r\n    MrSísterFister: ok i'll unpikc karthus\r\n    MrSísterFister: now what\r\n    MrSísterFister: go ahead?\r\n    MrSísterFister: not my fault riot autofilled me lmfao\r\n\r\n**{{champion:5}}  and his entire team kill me and take my blue side jungle**\r\n\r\n    MrSísterFister: this is pathetic  **as in, i'm getting destroyed this is pathetic**\r\n\r\n**{{champion:523}} starts telling me i'm inting and trolling**\r\n    MrSísterFister: really\r\n    MrSísterFister: yes\r\n    MrSísterFister: i am\r\n    MrSísterFister: xin been in my jg the entire game\r\n    MrSísterFister: its really not troll\r\n    MrSísterFister: its pretty simple\r\n\r\n**I'm being told I should have stopped clearing camps and ganked 3-4 levels behind the jungler and laners**\r\n    MrSísterFister: gank 3 levels behind and get 1 shot\r\n\r\n**{{champion:523}} says we should FF**\r\n    MrSísterFister: great idea\r\n\r\n**{{champion:523}} tells me to quit the game and play something else**\r\n    MrSísterFister: no i'm gonna play league\r\n    MrSísterFister: or\r\n    MrSísterFister: heres an idea\r\n    MrSísterFister: stop typing and ff so we can go next\r\n\r\n**{{champion:53}} finally decides enough is enough and sticks up for me** \r\n    MrSísterFister: its chill\r\n    MrSísterFister: if i'm gonna get blasted by xin the entire game in my jg and get flamed for it they deserve to lose\r\n    MrSísterFister: simple as that\r\n\r\n** and lastly, if 3 players are going to spend their time flaming the jungler then they just deserve the loss, I deserved the loss, and I WOULD deserve the loss if I spent all of my time flaming 1 person instead of playing the game**\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, in my honest opinion, this seems very tame. Could it have been handled even better? Probably, but the question is _**does it deserve**_\r\n1. 10 game chat restriction (preventing me to communicate constructively with my team for 10 games)\r\n2. Loss of ALL Honor and having my Honor locked out (approximately for 2 months)\r\n3. Loss of Clash\r\n4. Loss of all chat (Because I say GG in all chat at the end of almost every game)\r\n\r\n\r\nSo I feel I have been misread and witch hunted. I take this to riot support through a ticket thinking there obviously must have been some kind of mistake made. Long story short, I received 3 copy pastas (_2 after requesting a human because I believe the system made an error, because that is an option__)\r\n\r\nI was \"arguing\" with my teammates too much and I was being \"too negative\". And the ticket was forcibly closed without any kind of communication made.\r\n\r\nWas I rightly penalized, or wrongfully penalized?","replies":[]}
