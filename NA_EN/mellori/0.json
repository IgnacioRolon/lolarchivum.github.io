I have a habit of leaving my League logged in, so I hadn't signed out since the update until this morning to reboot. When I tried logging on again, it updated all over again from scratch. Now, after my computer died, it popped up with this:\n\nhttp://i.gyazo.com/acc6c07d6e592873cd0c0903a83d5fed.png\n\nhttp://i.gyazo.com/e656c6bfd1749afd29427abe739c6cca.png\n\nIt's been sitting at 0% and goes back and forth between 0 and 1 file scanned. Why does the client not want me to play so bad? It worked fine when I played earlier today, then I idled while I went to watch a movie, my computer died, and now after rebooting it's doing this. I don't want to uninstall/reinstall and lose my item sets. Help?\n\nEdit: It finally finished updating for a third time after an hour and a half.","replies":[{"poster":"Final Raid Boss","date":"2015-02-13T20:54:37.417+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"what the fuck is with riots shit client? i open the launcher today and now it's scanning files stuck at 33%. I already had the patch downloaded.\n\nevery fucking day it's a new problem: clients bugged, games bugged, lag, ddos. it all just goes to show how much of riots income goes towards the game.

I've closed and reopened the client at least 20 times (that usually does the trick whenever I have problems). I've sent all the logs. I really don't want to repair the client because I fear that will take forever and I have A LOT of item sets that I don't want to lose. I've found the mac client to  be quite buggy overall actually.
