What about you?","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Miscellaneous","up_votes":89,"down_votes":13,"body":"So, something I noticed last night while spamming games with a friend.. is that I tend to play similar champions.\r\n\r\nNo, not in playstyle.\r\nNot even in role.\r\nNot even in lane, category, or anything other than one factor.\r\n\r\n\r\n**_I play a lot of female champions._**\r\n\r\n\r\nNow before you guys go on a rant, I'M a female gamer. There, I said it. And I honestly, 100%, legitimately didn't notice this until last night. But when it did, it blew my mind away. I mean, here. Look at this.\r\n\r\nhttp://i.gyazo.com/45cca71f56b2cd0141116497d740f5d9.png\r\n\r\nOut of the first three rows, it's not until the start of row 3 that we see a male champion. Draven. (Draaaaaaaaaaaven.) And he's at a level one mastery, I've only played him a couple times. Not only that but out of the first 3 rows, 30 champions in total, only 6 that I play are guys. \r\nWho knows. It could be that playing female champions, being a female myself, feels more enjoyable in the male-dominanted game of League (Admit it ladies, 95% of League players are dudes. And they make it obvious.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSo that's where I wanna ask you, boards. Do you play champions that are your gender? Or the opposite? Why do you play who you play?","replies":[{"poster":"GtGW","date":"2015-07-28T07:50:33.162+0000","up_votes":48,"down_votes":0,"body":"And most contexts of fantasy involve a measure of personal relation to the characters to immerse the player effectively.
