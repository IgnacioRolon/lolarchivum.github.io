Let's make sure that you're opening the client through the League shortcut and not through Steam anymore just in case. Also, shoot me a screenshot of that 'close client during game' option being turned off. I've had a few instances where people thought it was turned off, but were mistaken, so I just want to be 100% sure we're on the same page.","replies":[{"poster":"Mellori","date":"2017-09-27T04:36:01.411+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I posted the above after uninstalling/reinstalling, which removed it from my Steam and Steam shortcuts entirely, and was opened via the League shortcut on my desktop but it's still happening, even in the games I've played since my original post.

Typically the close client option has been the quick and easy fix for this kind of issue, but it sounds like we're dealing with something entirely different possibly.
