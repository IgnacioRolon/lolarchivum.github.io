Trundles is removed, Dr Mundo&#039;s Headbutt tower damage is removed and so was Rengars long ago but Nasus can still 2/3 or even 1 shot towers with his? It doesn&#039;t take very long for Nasus to get 200 stacks and that is well enough for him to 3 - 4 shot towers by waiting less than 20 seconds. I would like some more explanation on why Riot even has this mechanic if only 1 gets to keep it.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2016-01-12T05:47:20.705+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":4,"body":"Some champions have power against towers as one of their intended strengths.

You obviously don't understand how split-pushers like Nasus (and Tryndamere) work, so allow me explain. Nasus (and similar split-pushers like Tryndamere) excels at splitting until someone comes to stop them, and if that were to happen: he would press R, drop his pimp cane on that guy and then take a tower and/or an inhibitor as a means of punishing the enemy team. You see, the point of Nasus isn't to becoming unkillable in a 1v1 (or 1v2, or 1v3) situation for no reason - it's to kill the person who comes to stop you and then use that time they have a grey screen to gain an objective for his team. Objective focus is the name of the game with Nasus.\n\nIf Nasus' ability to 3-shot turrets late game is taken away, how could he ever push for an advantage? You'd kill the player(s) coming to stop you but it would take you so long to destroy the turret/inhibitor afterwards, that another guy could easily come and probably stop you before you dealt meaningful damage to that structure. This would lead to an annoyingly long cycle of repeating the same process until death timers were so high, that Nasus could actually benefit from his kit's strengths. \n\nBut what nonsense am I spewing anyway, Meddler?

He's versatile in that respect and that's what has finally made him a good, solid pick.\n\nSeriously harming his ability to split push means you need to compensate for that elsewhere and instead of doing that, you're upping his mana costs.
