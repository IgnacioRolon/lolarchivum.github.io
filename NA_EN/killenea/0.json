Your MMR will still be around the same level. So in Silver 5 you are generally still playing with players ranging from Bronze 2 - Silver 4. Maybe getting an outlier. This is also assuming that you've played a fair amount of ranked so your MMR is stable and not still in the settling stage.\n\nRemember, your Tier/Division really only represents your end of season prize placing. Your MMR will determine who you play against. Your MMR goes up when you win, depending on the MMR of your opponents (tougher opponents == greater gains) and lowers the same way (tougher opponents == less losses).\n\nAs for how to not get placed there at the beginning of season 6. Just don't worry about that. It depends how hard they reset people, but if you get better during season 5, you will be able to climb back up to your MMR's tier range easily. Just concentrate on your play and getting better and you will be able to stay out of bronze MMR.","replies":[]},{"poster":"3tyson","date":"2015-03-01T16:01:35.447+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Isnt silver worse than bronse cause it has more trols ?\nIm unrankes my friend told me","replies":[{"poster":"rth2","date":"2015-03-02T15:24:27.008+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Each tier has trolls. You hit trolls from bronze to challenger. The difference in trolls in different tiers is usually skill / knowledge level.\n\nSo bronze may have less trolls (people intentionally being bad) because bronze is the bottom of the totem and you have a lot of people who are either relatively new, have less game knowledge, etc. As you move up it is assumed that you have more game knowledge. Though some people have really good game knowledge but just don't have the skills/mechanics to advance or can't make the in game decisions, although they can easily find the correct decisions when they review the game.\n\nActually, when I was in silver what I found annoying was the amount of people that would do 1 of 2 things :\n1) hate on players that were bronze (having a tier elitist idea is annoying)\n2) players that wanted to get into gold so bad that they would rage/complain/etc at the drop of a hat.\n\nAlthough it is worth noting that #1 happened a lot more than the rage. Ranked really is not as bad as people say. The bad games just tend to stick with your memory.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Junkο","date":"2015-03-01T20:22:14.875+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Any advice on how to get in Bronze?
