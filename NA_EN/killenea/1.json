Daily Login Rewards can motivate players to play daily, and those who already do, get rewarded for their loyalty. Even something like 50 ip or 10 RP on the 7th day can be enough to motivate people (how many times have you been 10 rp short from buying a skin?), but I'm sure Riot can come up with better ideas for rewards (like after 100 daily logins you get one refund point, or an icon). I know that extra ip on daily wins exist, but sometimes there are days when you only have time to play 1-2 games and lose. Daily Login Rewards is a better choice if you ask me. What do you think? If you agree lets get Riots attention.\r\n\r\nEdit: Or something like play x number of matches per week to get x reward","replies":[]}
