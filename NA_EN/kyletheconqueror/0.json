Just because someone picks a champion that isn't to your liking doesn't mean you need to give up in a game. If you actually cared about winning, then you would play the game and the other player play there game.\n\nIn games where I'm arguing with someone over something, another player always comes in and says \"just play the game.\" I can't even tell you how many times I've won because I didn't worry about my team and focused on winning. Players who are close-minded are players who don't adapt well to the game. probably why a lot of those players are either bronze or quit playing because they can't keep up.\n\nSo please tell me why I'm at fault for wanting to win a game.","replies":[{"poster":"leaugesbane","date":"2016-06-28T00:50:28.833+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=KyleTheConqueror,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=5Y2935rE,comment-id=00050000,timestamp=2016-06-21T15:04:08.550+0000)\n>\n> Every game you play, there is a risk. believe it or not, the risks are all the same.

No trolling or whatever.\n\nWe had a partial pre-made. 3 or 4 as I recall.. so there was ALWAYS a PUG element to the team. And happily, I think the PUG always went along.

I honestly believe Cassiopeia is a substantial support. Her W slow stops any movement abilities and deals damage over time. If you want to poke, just use your Q. if you ever get caught in a trade off, q/w + e. it's that simple. what makes it better is the mana refund if you kill a unit (only in certain situations) and the heal you get from poisoned units.\n\nSo honestly, if players just played the game and didn't worry about the chat, the game would be much nicer.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SKT GodKiller","date":"2016-06-21T01:33:43.575+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly, I get really toxic because of 2 reasons \n1: a player becomes incredibly egotistical saying lmao and stuff after a play with fizz or some other champion and ends up thinking hes the best, in bronze.\n2: I end up holding far too much of my anger, and generally get too annoyed, and you may say, \" just play some other game\" well the problem is, I generally feel bad if I leave my friends because they usually need to play with someone else.\nBut, yeah, Ashe was a jerk for leaving and blaming you for that, I mean, I would have been mad, but I have given crazier picks a chance","replies":[]},{"poster":"Oldwisepotato","date":"2016-06-20T21:39:42.507+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Didn't see anywhere to vote but I think the obvious answer is Ashe. I get what your saying, and i have seen all sorts of weird lane combinations while playing this game. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. However, Learned a long time ago not to question teammates picks generally. I would say I have at least won as many if not more games where my teammate has done an off meta pick like {{champion:69}} support. Generally because 1. the player has hopefully tried it a few times and had success (especially if bringing this pick to ranked). 2. The person your laning against probably has never or hardly ever faced that off meta match up as well, so they are most likely uncomfortable.\n\nThe only time I get mad with picks is if my team picks all ad just because its so easy for the enemy team to defend. Or if your team is all squish vs a fairly tanky team.
