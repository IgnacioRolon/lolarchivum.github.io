I see lots of  &quot;nerf x&quot; and &quot;y is overpowered!&quot; or &quot;plz buff z :(&quot; threads, but I don&#039;t see as much threads about what champs are balanced. \r\n\r\n I mean, we all know that Orianna is the basically the pinnacle of balance, but what other champs would you say are pretty balanced? As in not needing any changes at all or just a few number tweaks. \r\n\r\nImo, Janna is pretty balanced. She&#039;s got a shit ton of utility and mobility, but pays for it with her squishiness and reliance on items to be more impactful in a losing game. Great for chasing people down, but can only do so much when she&#039;s being bursted down.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?","replies":[{"poster":"Handy Sandy ","date":"2016-10-22T23:59:39.922+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:266}} {{champion:103}} {{champion:12}} {{champion:34}} {{champion:1}} {{champion:268}} {{champion:53}} {{champion:201}} {{champion:31}} {{champion:122}} {{champion:42}} {{champion:36}} {{champion:81}} {{champion:9}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:3}} {{champion:420}} {{champion:10}} {{champion:85}} {{champion:203}} {{champion:96}} {{champion:7}} {{champion:64}} {{champion:89}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:90}} {{champion:25}} {{champion:20}} {{champion:134}} {{champion:223}} {{champion:58}} {{champion:17}} {{champion:112}} {{champion:8}} {{champion:45}} {{champion:67}} {{champion:110}} {{champion:4}} {{champion:238}} {{champion:154}} {{champion:115}} {{champion:26}} \n\nPretty fair champions that are good at what they do and have counterplay.\n\nOrianna is the pinnacle of balance? I play her, her damage is insane. Especially early game where her autoattacks really hurt. They hurt even more later game. Taking control of group teamfights and providing the utility of a support but having the damage of a mage, almost impossible to sucessfully gank her since she has so much peel for herself. And she can share that peel with her entire team whenever she wants to. She's spreading the single target burst damage {{champion:34}} has across 2-5 of your allies.\n\nJust my opinion, but I'd say that {{champion:103}} is one of the most balanced. Not very good waveclear and her main damage is a skillshot. Also has a hard time teamfighting since her R/W will be messed up and hit someone she isn't aiming for, and she could die if she has the chance to autoattack to get her W onto the target.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Big Lincoln","date":"2016-10-22T23:56:43.568+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:122}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Stephen The G","date":"2016-10-23T02:21:18.911+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"imo all AP mages are balanced","replies":[]},{"poster":"oSEXYPLATYPUSo","date":"2016-10-22T23:53:54.184+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:63}} {{champion:1}} {{champion:34}} {{champion:245}} {{champion:81}} {{champion:114}} {{champion:150}} {{champion:79}} {{champion:420}} {{champion:39}} {{champion:24}} {{champion:126}} {{champion:222}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:85}} {{champion:21}} {{champion:76}} {{champion:92}} {{champion:68}} {{champion:134}} {{champion:67}} {{champion:45}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:83}} {{champion:143}}","replies":[{"poster":"McFatal","date":"2016-10-23T00:45:20.212+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MrFawknSunshine ,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=99Ox6fJf,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-10-22T23:53:54.184+0000)\n>\n> {{champion:63}} {{champion:1}} {{champion:34}} {{champion:245}} {{champion:81}} {{champion:114}} {{champion:150}} {{champion:79}} {{champion:420}} {{champion:39}} {{champion:24}} {{champion:126}} {{champion:222}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:85}} {{champion:21}} {{champion:76}} {{champion:92}} {{champion:68}} {{champion:134}} {{champion:67}} {{champion:45}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:83}} {{champion:143}}\n\nLUL","replies":[{"poster":"oSEXYPLATYPUSo","date":"2016-10-23T00:46:33.079+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its all the champs the community cries about sooo they have to be balanced otherwise they arent worth playing","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Dealth","date":"2016-10-23T00:32:35.707+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:412}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Baby Ghoul","date":"2016-10-23T00:06:07.369+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:103}} {{champion:32}} {{champion:201}} {{champion:131}} {{champion:9}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:150}} {{champion:40}} {{champion:59}} {{champion:10}} {{champion:203}} {{champion:89}} {{champion:117}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:54}} {{champion:25}} {{champion:56}} {{champion:58}} {{champion:113}} {{champion:27}} {{champion:15}} {{champion:163}} {{champion:44}} {{champion:18}} {{champion:23}} {{champion:4}} {{champion:161}} {{champion:254}} {{champion:112}} {{champion:62}} {{champion:101}} {{champion:5}} {{champion:115}} {{champion:26}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Commit Sudoku","date":"2016-10-22T23:55:20.833+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:12}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:201}} {{champion:60}} {{champion:81}} {{champion:120}} {{champion:38}} {{champion:64}} {{champion:127}} {{champion:25}} {{champion:267}} {{champion:2}} {{champion:61}} {{champion:78}} {{champion:421}} {{champion:15}} {{champion:72}} {{champion:223}} {{champion:44}} {{champion:48}} {{champion:29}} {{champion:112}} {{champion:101}} {{champion:154}} {{champion:115}}","replies":[]}]}
