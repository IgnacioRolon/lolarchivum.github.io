He is telling them that they should practice champions before they start to inting in competitive games. Anyone can get aggravated about anything that doesn't mean that he is toxic. Riots r%%%%%ed system doesn't work and punishes people that don't deserve these punishments. I have an account that got perma banned because of logs like this with proof. The people in the game that I got banned in said \"I will go to your house and slaughter your entire family\", constantly flame me and kys.

Something needs to change about the entire honor system. Chat restrictions are supposed to be a warning; then why does a mere warning strip you of all end of season rewards, and takes you months to restore what you once had? Even better, bring back the warning from the old client that you had been recently reported for verbal abuse. That may get people to step back on what they say. I know that if you've recently been toxic (but not enough to warrant a punishment) then your honor progress will be slowed.

The system is a joke.\n\nYou repeatedly called for reports for teammates you repeatedly labeled inters, called for reports for teammates you labeled AFK, called someone a noob, claimed you were \"the only one playing the game\" and throwing your teammates' scores in their faces, and asked the enemy team to report your team. All of this is harassment, none of it helps you win the game, and none of it makes a difference in whether your teammates get punished or not.\n\nScores like 0/6 don't necessarily indicate intentional feeding. When you harass people for it, they generally do worse, not better, and they're more likely to stop trying at all. This punishment was definitely warranted and you would do well to understand which of the things you said were unacceptable (most of your chat, honestly) if you want that account to remain accessible.","replies":[{"poster":"Neekoo Neeko Nee","date":"2019-04-22T21:44:26.634+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Firstly; the teammate I called AFK was my midlaner who rage quit after dying for the seventh time solo to an Anivia.
