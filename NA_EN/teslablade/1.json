Unless you cant.\n\n1.  How a discussion works is anyone can respond to whatever points they wish.  It could be any of them, or all of them.   They may refute said points or affirm them or go off on a tangent or just make a joke about something you said they thought was funny or whatever.   That's how a discussion works.  You don't get to dictate the manner in which someone chooses to respond.  \n\n2.  It's easy to pop off and demonize Riot and accuse them of lying.  Far more likely is they fully intended to bring it back or thought that they could,  then realized that the two queues cannot coexist at platinum and above without totally horrendous wait times in both solo queue and dynamic queue.    But that wouldn't fit the narrative of Big Bad Riot.  \n\n3.  I get the feeling that you don't think anyone that disagrees with you matters.   You are mistaken.  And even in a real election, which message board votes are not, those elected would be wise to remember that those that don't vote do matter because if the person elected messes up, they will be voting the next time.

We would also see youtube videos praising dynamic q. Yet, we dont. Strangely enough....\n\nAll i am saying that its incorrect saying that all players who play the game like or support dynamic. They may just not care. Just like they didnt care where there was soloq.\n\nSo again, they should not even be considered in the equation, because they will like the game either way.\n\nYes, it is a game, but thats a shit argument. So what if its a game? OH yea, that means we shouldnt care, its just a game eh?","replies":[{"poster":"Decrit","date":"2016-07-06T14:37:12.476+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Dextix LT,realm=EUNE,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=zYOn7Pjw,comment-id=001000000000000000000000,timestamp=2016-07-06T14:21:32.192+0000)\n>\n> If your point was right we would see threads praising dynamic over reddit, these boards. We would also see youtube videos praising dynamic q. Yet, we dont. Strangely enough....\n\nI actually said that satisfacted players feel no need to post too often because they are satisfacted, they have less impulse to do so of their own. And indeed there were praise posts. \nBut as i said, people are not motivated to keep going giving praises because they are already satisfacted. Unsatisfied players, on the other hand, are quite the opposite. Plus, the latter tends to downvote other posts ( i am kidding... they don't  tend, they do) because they have in that moment a more aggressive mindset, abusing the vote feature to downvote what they don' t like ( like the few posts of those who praise the changes, that feel more and more aggressed upon and feel less and less prone to post).\n\nbecause, again, you are not the center of the world. a player could just *don' t care about your opinion* and move on while letting you express your own. without downvotes or upvotes.\n\nplus to the eyes of many praising Riot is downgraded as \"whiteknighting\" or \"asslicking\" aniway.\n\n> \n> Yes, it is a game, but thats a shit argument. So what if its a game? OH yea, that means we shouldnt care, its just a game eh?\n\nIt was probably delusional to me to think you could understand without misinterpretating? as a game it' s important to us because it takes our time and passion, but it' s *just a game* because there are far more important things in life. It' s worth of our care, but not so much that we have to burn our liver over a part of it we don' t like.","replies":[{"poster":"Dextix LT","date":"2016-07-06T15:06:14.174+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And im saying that constant praise is not needed. Yet we didnt see almost any real praise. There is no need for constant praise of dynamic, but even when it went out, even before it went out, it was not received well. And noone really praised it in any way. Even in little ammounts it was not praised.\n\nVoting system is for agreeing and disagreeing. Im getting annoyed by people who say that its being \"abused\" when its just an indication of opinion.\n\nPraising riot is not degraded. It is degraded only when no sufficient reasons other than \"adapt or gtfo\" are given. Many people praise Riot, even i praise Riot in many of their good decisions.\n\nAnd i did not misinterpret anything. Even in your current reponse, you again state \"its just a game\". Again, so what? So what if it is just a game? Enjoyment and entertainment is also an important life of people life. Not everyone is destined to be the next superhero or an astronaut, they choose what is important to them.","replies":[{"poster":"Decrit","date":"2016-07-06T15:20:33.590+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"if constant praise is not needed, then you just repeated what i said before - people praised a lot of times DQ when it came out and casually after, but it went submerged by the downvoting horde of those who were not satisfacted with it.\n\nThat is abusing. You are using a tool devoted to control discussion to personal opinion instead; this is especially important in a medium where people go for a reason, like boards. people just want to be heard more if they want to vent. it' s natural.\n\nProcedurally speaking, takes a whole lot more to read throught a post and see if it is upvote-worth rather midnlessly downvote it becase it talks an opinion opposite to yours, even by glancing at the title. And once you get a single downvote before anyone else can give an upvote, your post is doomed.\n\nIt' s not the only time it happened, like many other things after all.\n\nAlso yes you keep on misinterpretating, what i meant was not derogatory. Sorry if i can' t express myself better, but there are many things that can be said with the same pair of words and if you can' t manage to understand what i do mean even if i focus on it then my bad, but i lost my patience to explain it further.","replies":[{"poster":"Dextix LT","date":"2016-07-06T16:59:43.187+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But if they praised so much and they should be the majority, how did the get downvoted at the start? Again, going by your logic. Those who like the product will come, about one time to praise it. \n\nThis means that at the start there will be a lot of them. But if they were overpowered by downvotes even at that time, this shows that people who dislike the system were still in the majority.\n\nAgain, how is it abusing the system if it is to agree or disagree with points? Thats the purpose of upvotes downvotes, agreeing and disagreeing, thus showing the forming consensus.\n\nAnd yes, i agree that some people will upvote or downvote based on the title. But that will not be the majority, the majority will read, to look whether or not they agree. And having a downvote doesnt mean it will keep geting downvotes. Many off my threads in the old forums at first got downvotes, just to get upvotes later especially after an extended discussion.\n\nAgain, what am i misinterpreting when you keep repeating \"Its just a game\" Phrase. The only time it is EVER used is in a derogatory manner, when either making fun out of people and something they care about, or trying to show that something is insignificant.\n\nYou are trying to portray these arguments as unimportant because it is just a game, no worth losing sleep over it. Its in essence derogatory as it is downplaying peoples passions and giving them \"Ratings\" of what is \"important\" or not.","replies":[{"poster":"Decrit","date":"2016-07-07T09:16:32.619+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"... dude. seems you do not even try to read my posts.\n\nand i am not paid to deal with people dense like you.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"AdeBug","date":"2016-07-07T15:41:54.671+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not a fair example/comparison, because elections are timed and everyone knows they take place.
