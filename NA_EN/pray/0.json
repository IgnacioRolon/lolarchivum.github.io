It doesn't matter if their screenname is Chinese, you're not allowed to make racist remarks.\n\nEspecially remarks that categorically assert that \"Chinese always suck at League\".\n\n> he is a well known boosted player in high elo...\n\nIf you believe they were boosting, report them for it. Otherwise, their behavior is completely irrelevant to your punishment.\n\n> is ther any chance my ban could be reversed so i dont decay out of grandmaster, and instead i be given chat restricitons?\n\nNo. Riot holds a strict zero-tolerance policy against racism, and they punish racism with a 14-day suspension on the first verified offense; you should _know_ better than to make racist remarks, and Riot expects as much of you. A Chat restriction would thus be far too lenient for an offense you _know_ you shouldn't be committing.\n\nIf the ban causes you to decay out of Grandmaster tier, then that's just the situation you put yourself in. You chose to break the rules - in an egregious way, no less - so you have to accept the consequences.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Pray","date":"2019-05-11T00:00:57.676+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Umbral Regent,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=RKAdwitY,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2019-05-10T23:58:23.023+0000)\n>\n> Pray: always suck\n> Pray: at league\n> \n> If you got escalated to a 14-day ban without having prior chat restrictions, this'd be why.

They didnt ban you for anyone but you. Anyways, you dont suck dude idk why you say all chinese suck. I SUCK. You are good. Anyone in diamond is relatively good, as most players are bronze-silver. Of course relative to professionals maybe he sucks lol. You just wanted to insult and offend him, and thats what causes Riots playerbase numbers to drop. People leave this game because of toxicity, and so Riot made these rules to help deter that. You fuck with their bottom line, theyre gonna ban you. Simple as that.
