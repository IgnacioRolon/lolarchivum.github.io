Its just an island that boyscouts go to for a camping trip. There is no longer nearly as many champions that can safely tell junglers to piss off because junglers are just so goddamned consistant. So even if you won champ select and have the enemy 20 cs down you can easily get ganked out of nowhere when you try to punish your opponent. \r\n\r\nMordekaiser literally removes this and kills you making toplane an even lane no matter what. He simultaneously makes it unpalitable for his ally to gank as he will be pushing most likely and his ult removes his allies from ganking as well. Id literally rather face a mordekaiser than play without mordekaiser in the game.\r\n\r\nTahm kench is constantly compared to mordekaiser but hes not the same. He doesnt remove junglers from toplane and his main problem is his q is way too big a skillshot for how much damage he does. Mordekaiser doesnt have basically guarenteed poke he just has a ton of all in ergo they arent the same.","replies":[{"poster":"ChaosReyn","date":"2019-06-19T23:32:49.519+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"What it really comes to is that junglers are consistent, and top is simply not consistent. At all.\n\nThere's a world of counterpicks and possibilities up there, whereas in every other lane, it's FotM picks (like 10 at most, really) and you ban 1 you don't like and play one of the remaining 7 or 8 (other team's ban and possibly pick). In top, it's a mad-house, and it's pretty much a case of it being impossible to have that island situation because one of you at top, be it you or the enemy, is already by pick order at such a huge fucking disadvantage that the jungler pretty much *has* to camp top so you can stay in the game and be relevant 10-15 minutes later.\n\nThat gets *slightly* easier as Morde since he has the ult to guarantee a 1v1 (or two 1v1s, if your jungler was closeby) but Morde's early game is actually really weak, and his dueling potential doesn't really pick up much til a couple items in. If you're in a disadvantageous lane as Morde (ex. against Trundle, Udyr or Aatrox, all of which are more than able to outduel you in a 1v1 handily, even if you steal their stats) then you're at best denying the enemy jungle an assist if you press R, and putting full faith in your jungle winning his 1v1 and then being able to clean up your lost one. At least until late game, where you reach a critical mass of Magic Pen and basically deal true damage from ignoring so much resistance that it's physically impossible to block your damage.\n\nSo no...not even the master of metal can cure top lane. But on the other hand of that...top lane doesn't really need cured. They just need to make it easier for most lanes to hold more than 10 viable champions again, and free up space for people to play what they want. That's what s2 and s3 had that these seasons don't: right now, if you want to play the game, you pick/ban from FotM or lose (except in top). They're FotM cause Riot's numbers make them the strongest picks for the lane. They need to make more access for playability and *viability* for other lanes, so that more lanes play like top, and more people can play more roles. That would make the junglers in turn less consistent, because then they'd have to care for multiple crazy lane matchups (and their own matchups) instead of \"vertical jungle, gank top, back, gank bot, try for drag, vertical jungle, gank top, camp top or bot...\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kelg","date":"2019-06-20T02:46:52.961+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Top lane is just too easy of a gank target, it feels terrible to play this role.
