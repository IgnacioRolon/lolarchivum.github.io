What do you do when youre trying to survive a camp? Honestly i dont even try to ward anymore simply because of how tedious and pointless it is (as soon as he comes into your lane you will lose your ward and be easily ganked anyway then proceed to wait another 5 minutes for a 150 second ward).\n\n2 rules for posting on this forum. Id rather not have riot posting: They will likely say something along the lines of &quot;well you need to complete 3 impossible task 1 is milking the angriest bull in the known world 2 is getting the golden fleece from what i assume is a purple hydra and 3 is getting a decent amount of ward coverage with the current state of wards.&quot; They will probably simplyfy it tho \"use cc.\"\n{{champion:20}} {{champion:28}} {{champion:33}} {{champion:114}} \nId also rather not have higher elos tip because they are almost guaranteed to say something along the lines of &quot;ask your jungler for a gank&quot; or &quot;plant the wards better&quot; as if were all gods at the game. Also since they will be extremely biased as they never admit that their teams are shit sometimes then proceed to go passive agressive as hell on stream. However if they do have a tip that isnt along those lines go ahead. \n{{champion:432}} {{champion:223}} {{champion:67}} {{champion:238}} \nThe reason id rather have lower elos is simply because meanwhile it might not be the strongest of sources it will definitly help on the task of climbing in this elo. It will also come from experience in this elo.\n\nNote if i sound angry in this note i apologize as the last time i won a ranked game i was 19/9/18. and before that it was 15/5. A little tilted right now. Im too tired to think of a closeing &quot;good luck in soloque and have a wonderful day.&quot;\n~mosdeadly, the mig- screw it im the mighty corpse now","replies":[{"poster":"Changsty","date":"2015-12-02T01:42:34.377+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because the truth is that the only thing you can do is to get better.\n\nIf you're getting camped, that means the enemy jungler isn't applying pressure elsewhere therefore your own jungler should be getting objectives on the other side of the map. However, that's beyond your control. What's within your control is to stop dying to ganks. Learn to last hit under tower and you won't lose in farm. Learn to freeze lane so you don't need to overextend. Pinks are equivalent to a bit more than three minion kills so there's really no reason not to grab a couple for extra lane safety.\n\nAn assist/kill for the jungler averages out to be around 2 jungle camps worth of gold. If taking you down is easier than taking two camps, you might want to reevaluate your playstyle.","replies":[{"poster":"Maximum Morde","date":"2015-12-02T17:10:37.147+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Changsty,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Ouh2mOGs,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-12-02T01:42:34.377+0000)\n>\n> Because the truth is that the only thing you can do is to get better.\n> \n\nTell that to Dyrus.","replies":[{"poster":"GetBoomedOn","date":"2015-12-02T17:15:04.729+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Maximum Morde,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Ouh2mOGs,comment-id=00020001,timestamp=2015-12-02T17:10:37.147+0000)\n>\n> Tell that to Dyrus.\n\nIn professional League coordination is often times so good even your tower can't save you.

That also means YOU know where jungler will most likely be, so let the rest of the team know.\n\nCommunication is key, light up their side of the jungle closest to you or light up both the river and tribush\n\nBut most importantly, as weird as it sounds, continue to force the camp, even if you spend 200+ gold every time you back, every time the jungler ganks and fails, he's wasting far more time and gold by missing the kill, and if you're a competent enough player to dodge the gank every time, that means your imbeciles of teammates are not getting killed. \n\nYou'll see it coming from afar and you'll be wasting plenty of the jungler's time. I switch between top and jungle and I love getting camped, just ward the crap out of your side so you'll see it coming and you can effectively turn the game into a 4v5 with the jungler so far behind from the number of fail ganks.\n\nAnd if you still play Sion (He's my go to for top lane), he does extremely well with dealing with camping now, ward both the river bush and tribush, play aggressive post 6. Everytime you see jungler, just R back to your tower. It's pretty hysterical how much opposing team rages when you do this.  \n\nIts kind of disappointing how many junglers don't understand how to react to a camp/gank. You see their jungler top lane? Take dragon. Take their bottom side jungle. Gank bottom, gank mid lane if you can move quick enough, just do something other then farm in your own damn jungle.

Ultimately your goal is predict the path enemy jungler will take to reach your lane, if you're getting camped, then usually the direction will normally be from through the lane gank or through river gank,\n\nTrying to loop up and over the dragon/baron takes too long if you're going to be in the lane repeatedly, so you can usually eliminate that path. \n\nIf you're getting pushed in constantly to your tower, put a ward on one of the lane bushes as they will most likely come through the lane.\n\nIf you're pushing, I would either place the river bush ward further down (where the rift scuttler ward sits) and put another one where blue/red buff, from there, you usually have an accurate story of where potential gank will come from, using just three wards (pink and two greens.)\n\nUltimately, you will most likely fall behind in CS in a camp situation, but the main goal here is to waste as much time as you possibly can for the jungler so while you're losing gold and experience, their jungler is also losing gold and experience.

When someone is getting camped, they will bait a gank 3 or 4 times making sure that the opposition gets nothing out of it.  Then when they see the jungler coming again they will immediately tp to another lane and force a turret down.  The jungler can't respond timely enough to help out and if the opposing top laner comes to help the laning allies are usually there to help out.  It is risky but it forces a reaction out of the opposition and they aren't able to pre plan what they are going to do.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shac Norris","date":"2015-12-02T01:22:22.788+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> i dont even try to ward anymore\n\nJust pink a river bush and use your free wards and **keep track of the enemy jungler**\nAllies don'tward?
