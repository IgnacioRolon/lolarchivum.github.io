Now since ever Patch 6.22 got live, I got on my Alpha Client and it was being patched, however I noticed that it got removed from my desktop but it was still in my \"Riot Games\" folder and control panel, and it says Lol Alpha Client. But I still have the original client on the desktop, so I opened it up but I didn't get any notification to update to the beta client if I'm correct. And shouldn't Patch 6.22 introduce you to the new beta client and removes your old/alpha client? I then checked from my friend since he was an Alpha Tester too, and his old client got removed from his desktop but it was still in his \"Riot Games\" folder and his Lol Alpha client shortcut got updated and was still on his desktop and his \"Riot Games\" folder but it no longer said \"Lol Alpha Client\" but it now says \"Lol Client\". Not sure what to do right now @Riot, should I uninstall and reinstall or...?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-11T02:57:28.167+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you launch your regular client and let it patch, then launch into the login screen, you should be in the Beta client. \n\nLet me know if you still have issues accessing it.","replies":[{"poster":"SayAweeMan","date":"2016-11-11T22:20:33.989+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I still have trouble, my original client has been patched to 6.22 and no notification to update to beta client.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-13T00:54:59.936+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The open beta client looks like the same updated client you've been testing all along.  Many players who recently patched their updated client may lose their desktop icon.  You'll want to check to see updated client is still installed in the same directory as your original League of Legends client:\n\nNavigate to the location you installed League, likely **C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends**.  \n\nIn there you'll find **LeagueClient.exe** which you can Create Shortcut or Send To Desktop.
