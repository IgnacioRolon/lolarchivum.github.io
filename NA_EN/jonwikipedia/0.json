I'm sorry to hear you're having issues playing with your Mac in the SEA servers. Unfortunately, Riot doesn't operate League in the SEA region, so you'll want to contact Garena's [**Support Team**](http://intl.garena.com/support/), as they operate and support League in these regions.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions.","replies":[]}]}
