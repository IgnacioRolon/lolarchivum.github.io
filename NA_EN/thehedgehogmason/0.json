Was {{champion:19}}  and level one so when i got back i died alot. We recovered.  Enemy Team ff'ed. low priority queue for 20 minutes.\n_does this even count as a low priority for no re-_\n\nSo,\nI was playing league of legends as normally (on a mac[please forgive my sins]with some friends) and we were in the loading screen. I said to them (i was in a discord with them) \"why is loading taking forever.\" 7 minutes later the game crashes. I relaunch league to a minute of loading then seeing that im lvl 1 and we are 8 minutes into the game. I then tried to farm minions but everyone kept killing me. Yi (the jungler) let me take jung until i recovered in levels. I participaited in some teamfights and didnt get that much kills since if i went in i would die from the 2 other people near the person i was attacking. Soon enough i started doing that (risky strats xd) and got some kills. 20 minutes in of getting jungle creeps and trying to get kills they ff. I come back into the win screen to see that im in low priority queue **for 20 minutes** A week earlier (or shorter or longer idk) i was in low priority queue for 10 minutes because macs are dumb and get random fps problems and crashing problems(and also a glitch where you have to double left click for no reason which is so annoying and only happens in blind pick that i have to restart league to fix it getting behind) but i got out of it. I might be able to earn money this summer by mowing lawns so i can get a windows thats somewhat better than a mac(probably gonna try to get alienwear but those cost so much and mowing lawns takes a long time)Can someone help?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-14T20:41:36.410+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Oh snap, that sucks that it took so long to get into the match, then you still ended up with another LPQ even though you were able to finish out the game =\\ . It doesn't really sound fair, but essentially you were still AFK for those first 8 minutes. It's only the beginning of the game and a small amount of time, that 8 minutes could have meant the difference in winning or losing. Because you weren't in the match for so long, the system will still flag it as a left match.\n\nLet's see if I can help out to make sure you don't have to deal with those obscene loading times anymore since an 8 min loading time is definitely not gonna work very well.
