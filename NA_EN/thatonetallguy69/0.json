Just one problem. Where do I buy them now? I screwed around in the store for a while, but I couldn&#039;t find it at all anywhere.\r\n\r\nAlso, why isn&#039;t there a drop down option in the store when buying runes to sort by IP? My goal for League is to eventually own all the rune pages possible, all the runes, and all the champions (and potentially with enough time, money, and care, all the skins). The easiest way for me to do this is to buy the cheap stuff first (or the expensive ones if i wanna blow through all my IP fast).\r\n\r\nJust some thoughts and questions.","replies":[{"poster":"Tsumikiri","date":"2016-10-30T22:55:36.664+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Where do I buy [rune pages] now?\n\nGo to the store, then Gameplay. Change all three of the drop-down menus to say \"Show All\" (yes, even the one that says Tier 3). Pretty sure Riot will be changing this since a lot of people have been having trouble finding Rune Pages.\n\n> My goal for League is to eventually own [...] all the runes[...]\n\nIIRC you can't own all the runes. There is a set limit to the number of runes you can have on your account, and I don't think it's that high. I can't find a red post about it at the moment, and I can't remember what the limit is exactly, sorry.","replies":[{"poster":"Thatonetallguy69","date":"2016-10-30T23:05:35.220+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I looked through the runes quite extensively and couldn't find it\n\nAlso, I'm limited on how many runes I can have?? Like, what if I buy some and later don't want them anymore? What if they fall off meta (like gold and ex runes did)? If that is true, i will be quite sad","replies":[{"poster":"Tsumikiri","date":"2016-10-30T23:14:17.297+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here's a screenshot.

It's kinda jankey, but it works. I had some tier 1 and 2 runes removed from my account by doing this a couple years ago.","replies":[{"poster":"DontHassleDaHoff","date":"2016-11-02T14:26:26.328+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for helping out with this.  We do have a fix for this that we'll be pushing out shortly. When we added in the \"default to T3\" it was counting the Rune Pages as well :/ We'll be pinning those to their location so that they'll keep that #1 and #2 spot.","replies":[{"poster":"Tsumikiri","date":"2016-11-03T02:37:04.069+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No problem.
