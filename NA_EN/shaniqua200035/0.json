It sounds like the installation did not go well, so a reinstall was a solid step to take.  You could be having network problems if you're unable to connect to the authentication servers.  I suggest using the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to make sure your connection can get through.
