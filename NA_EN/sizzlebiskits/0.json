This might have something to do with your config files, so let's start by trying to reset those and see if the timers come back.\n\n- Log into the game client\n- Navigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\n- Delete the file  named **game.cfg** and **persistedsettings.json**\n- Go into a custom game and verify that settings have saved properly. \n- Leave game to sync settings\n\nHit me back if that doesn't help!","replies":[]}]}
