I was running the game flawlessly up until a couple days ago where I started to get a lot of FPS drop. Usually it runs around 250-300 fps, however after 10 or so minutes in game, it drops to around 70 and sometimes even down to 30. I have monitored the temperatures and the 1080 doesnt go above 45 degrees, the rest of the temperatures look fine as well\n\nDoes anyone have any idea what this could be caused by?\n\nI run minimal programs in the background, (chrome, spotify, discord) and have always had in the past, so I don't think any of them could be the problem.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-23T02:39:15.674+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sometimes higher-end pc's can start seeing some weird frame-skipping, but generally it can be a pretty easy fix by capping your fps. Give that a try using [**this guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209010626) as a resource if you need, but definitely hit me back up if it doesn't help.","replies":[{"poster":"Sprayed","date":"2017-11-23T02:46:40.141+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey buddy, thanks for replying! I tried capping my frames at 60 fps, but I was still dropping below that, down to around 30 periodically, mostly in teamfights.","replies":[]}]}]}
