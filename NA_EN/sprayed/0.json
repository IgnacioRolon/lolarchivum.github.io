Normally I run it at 144hz synced to my monitor. Even while it runs at 60 frames its extremely choppy and difficult to play.\r\n\r\nI have done everything that the help page says to do.

Start off by making sure any third-party programs that might have overlays are turned off (*especially* Discord) and then make sure you've got the latest driver updates for that 1080 GTX. \n\nLet me know if you see any changes in a custom game after testing these steps.

With that being ruled out, I'm wondering if something is a little off within your specs or settings and I want to make sure nothing gets missed. It can be hard for us to troubleshoot from here, so if you don't mind shoot a ticket with this info over to our techs in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). Also be sure to include your game logs so the techs can get a bigger picture of your system configurations and see what they can spot.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"KMyL","date":"2018-01-22T09:28:37.122+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi.\nCan you tell me what motherboard you have & what system you have installed- at this point I'll ask also about updates: are you patched your system with the latest patches?\nAfter that can you tell me do you have any other games & do you have any issues with them?\nAnd at the end (here) I'll ask about your safety: do you use any antivirus protection?","replies":[{"poster":"Sprayed","date":"2018-01-23T01:19:32.001+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey!\n\nI have the Asus STRIX Z270E GAMING ATX Mobo and my system and graphics card drivers are up to date.
