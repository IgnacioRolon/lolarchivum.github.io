Getting to the point that I&#039;m just going to quit the game because this is ridiculous.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-06-20T23:36:39.785+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What GPU, OS, drivers, other hardware?\n\nCan you get far enough into the game client to start a repair, and have you tried downloading the installer and running it again?","replies":[{"poster":"KiIIbo Fraggins","date":"2017-06-21T00:09:16.498+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"AMD fx(tm)-4300 quad, Windows 10, amd radeon r7 200 series. other hardware nothing really extra on here. yes i have done several repairs. i can log on to the client and try to spectate or start a game and it pops up right after i try. i have uninstalled the game and reinstalled as well","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-06-21T03:37:49.309+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you tried the low-spec mods, and otherwise disabling as many settings as possible?
