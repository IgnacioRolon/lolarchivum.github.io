Theres no definition or detail in the Character. He looks like a prototype model. Which is really sad because Orange is my favorite and it just feels unsatisfying playing with the Chrome. Can this be fixed in the near future?","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2020-02-13T01:29:51.423+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is the same textures, just a different color? Looks fine to me, are you using some weird contrast or a shitty TN monitor?","replies":[{"poster":"GoldRush99","date":"2020-02-13T01:52:47.121+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It may look like that at a quick glance but ones you continue to look at it you can see that there is no texture, just a rounded off model of Zac. Plus if you look at his hands and feet they are blocky and have a defining line that shouldnt be there. Also there is no shadowing to the Chrome which is shown on yellow and pink. With this shadowning and depth It makes the champion look real and muscler, instead of a solid, round, and boxy champion with no depth.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Pkfriend","date":"2020-02-13T16:50:14.975+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Itâ€™s kinda wacky doe, I have the same problem.","replies":[]},{"poster":"myamia","date":"2020-02-13T00:47:09.450+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"because riot didn't think of how to go about selling skins for him so they shat those out.","replies":[]}]}
