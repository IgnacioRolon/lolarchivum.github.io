Outstanding performances, teamwork, and sportsmanship are what earns you chests and keys. Let&rsquo;s clarify the sportsmanship part. \n\nWe want to focus on creating rewards and incentives for consistently sportsmanlike players. That&rsquo;s why previously penalized players need to demonstrate commitment to positive play over time, even after wrapping up a chat restriction or ban. It&rsquo;s also why we&rsquo;ve decided against sharing the exact requirements for restoring access to earned loot. Doing so would encourage good sportsmanship for a defined period, and not much longer. \n\nTo add some clarity, more severe infractions incur longer ineligibility periods. If you&rsquo;re currently ineligible for earned content, this is on you. Since Hextech launched, we&rsquo;ve seen a meaningful number of players earn access to the system&rsquo;s rewards. Stay focused on solid comms, teamwork, and sportsmanship in your games and you&rsquo;ll be earning chests, keys, and loot sooner rather than later. \n\nThis approach reflects how we&rsquo;ll build reward systems going forward, awarding the majority sweet loot, and temporarily excluding the minority while they prove they can stick to the community&rsquo;s standards. There&rsquo;s a ton of space to explore in recognizing and rewarding sportsmanship and we&rsquo;re psyched about the possibilities for the future of League.","replies":[{"poster":"55987","date":"2016-04-04T20:57:17.324+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":126,"body":"I got a chat ban 3 months ago and I'm still ineligible for loot.

As it turns out, though, I was taking the wrong approach. Sweeping the problem under the rug isn't the same as actually solving it, and it took the most serious of punishments before I was actually FORCED to stop and think about where the problem actually was _(in my case, the problem was in my lack of self-confidence and trying to handle everything on my own)_.\n\nI'm not disagreeing with you, though. I just wanted to share my own perspective on the matter.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Tantram","date":"2016-04-04T23:20:44.056+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":1,"body":"That's actually a very good perspective to share.

I'm going to link to this for my own reference.\n\n\"What they need to do\" is different from person to person, though, and it isn't something an automated system can tell them. Obviously I wouldn't expect it to, since it's only a program and can't discern an individual's psychology.\n\nFor some people, just steeling their resolve and avoiding saying negative things works. These are likely the people who don't progress past the chat restriction tiers. _(There's also muting/not using chat, but this IS a social/teamwork game at its core, so that feels like more of a band-aid fix. Paranoia over the idea of being reported for the slightest of things likely doesn't help, but that's more to do with peoples' perceptions of the Instant Feedback system.)_\n\nFor the people this doesn't work for, though, the actual solution is much less clear. It's easy to still think that \"just don't be negative in chat\" is the answer, since it's the easiest and most obvious way out, and it's what a reform card seems to indicate on the surface. Like I said, that's the trap I got caught in. \n\nThanks for reading and responding to my thoughts, by the way. I don't want to take up too much of your time, so I'll leave it at this. Any further and this'd turn into a discussion of human psychology, which isn't a field I'm certified in.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
