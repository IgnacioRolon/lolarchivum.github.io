So, after the second time, I changed my password and didn't have the problem again yesterday or today. I played a lot earlier today, then went to work. When I got home, I log back on to a message that says \"(insert friend's Summoner name) has received their Officer Vi skin\" and I look at my RP and it's down from 600 something to 128. I just changed my e-mail on my account, and I am about to change my password again. Is there any way to get my RP back or at least a way to prevent this from happening? I haven't given my password (or even my username for that matter) to anyone, I don't let people smurf on my account, and I don't share my account with anyone in any way.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-11T18:58:28.833+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd first ensure your account is secure using [this guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751664-Protecting-Your-Account), then reach out to our account specialists in a [support ticket.](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) We'll be able to work with you 1 on 1 there.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}
