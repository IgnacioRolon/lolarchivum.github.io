In fact, I feel that every champion should have an equal chance to be a chess piece for TFT, regardless of how odd their gameplay might be compared to other champions. The fact that they reduced Yuumi to an item honestly paints a bad image for the future of the game. The dev team shouldn't be limiting themselves from new and unique ideas, they should be embracing it. Since TFT is in the PBE, they really shouldn't be shying away from trying things that define the Autochess genre as the silly, crazy, yet strategic genre that it is.\r\nI can even give ideas as to how they could implement her. Here they are:\r\n\r\n-Her ability can be either her Q, or her E.\r\n\r\n-She can have her Origin/Class be unique to her. (Like Yasuo's \"Exile\", and Blitzcrank's \"Robot\".)\r\n\r\n-Her Origin/Class can read something along the lines of: \"Units of this Origin/Class will attach themselves to adjacent ally units. Units of this Origin/class cannot attach to other units of this Origin/Class. The unit cannot attack nor take damage as long as they are attached to an ally. The unit can gain mana from their attached ally's attacks. If the attached ally dies, this unit will reattach to another adjacent ally after 3 seconds. Allies cannot have more than 1 unit attached to them.\"\r\n\r\nSo there they are. Obviously, much of it would need tweaking, and the description would need to be shortened.\r\nThe item version of Yuumi we have now can be replaced by something like Arcane Comet, to make the unit a sorcerer.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next thing I'd like to talk about is an Origin that really stands out to me as outright broken.\r\nThe Origin I am referring to is the \"Glacial\" Origin. Getting stun locked with no counter play is never really a fun mechanic.\r\nThe only thing that *kinda* counters Glacial is Yordles. Even then, you can give Volibear rapid fire cannon, and at that point there's practically nothing the opposing player can do. I feel that there should be an innate cooldown to stuns. Like if a unit is stunned for 5 seconds, the unit becomes immune to stuns for 2.5 seconds, or resistant to stuns by 75% for 5 seconds. (Like the 'tenacity' mechanic.)\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd finally, i'd like to write down some cosmetic ideas that I wrote a while ago in a separate thing, but it wasn't these forums.\r\n\r\nI think Aery should be a playable Little Legend! Or to avoid awkward \"multiple Aery\" moments in the Howling Abyss, it can be a larger, red version of her, and she can be Aery's sister or something along the lines of that. She can have all the color variants (Like Toxic Aery, Shadow Isles Aery, etc..), and she'll progressively look like a cooler, more grown and detailed \"spirit fox\" with each star level.\r\n\r\nAn over sized Bard Meep would also be a cool Little Legend!\r\n\r\nAnd for the actual maps themselves, a Bildgewater and a Celestial tip of Mount Targon themed map would be awesome.\r\n\r\nAlso, we should be able to change the background of the maps as well. (The cloudy sunset background.)\r\n\r\n\r\nWell that's it.\r\n\r\nTL;DR: Yuumi needs to be a chess piece, not an item. Glacial needs tweaking. A bigger version of Aery and Bard Meep would be nice Little Legends. Map ideas, and background changes.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-07-06T00:56:59.177+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> An over sized Bard Meep would also be a cool Little Legend!\n\nYou just discovered the true nature of the pengus.","replies":[]}]}
