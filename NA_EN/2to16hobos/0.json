I just had to dodge a game because a duo was about to go vayne jungle and MF top. MF had ghost/heal and Vayne had ghost/flash. Like literally every game someone makes the call of \"oh its just pre season. it doesn't matter\" But like your mmr is affected for the main season. This is getting really annoying and it needs to stop.","replies":[{"poster":"Gawie","date":"2019-11-24T00:36:23.501+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It feels like everyone got lobotomized. Games in platinum feels like bronze 5 games maybe is the time to stop playing rankeds. I we found it a bit waste of my time. Trolls everywere (got one good game so far). I was hyped about preseason changes but that kind of ruined everything :D and I feel like League is no longer for me :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"LoafingWill","date":"2019-11-24T21:48:53.170+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I've experience a lot of games lately where people don't care about what happens cause it's preseason. Had a rakan support who after a couple misplays happened with the team all but AFKed. He refused to fight anymore and sat right outside fights happening and ulted and flashed in place, spam pinging the people who messed up. Worse thing is he didn't talk at all so I doubt any punishment will happen. This is supposed to be a good time to try new things up and potentially raise MMR for the new season but the trolls are out in large this time I guess. I don't remember it being this bad last season but who knows, that was a year ago.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Magnafiend","date":"2019-11-22T21:20:50.844+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Glad I haven't really touched ranked then (not that my ranked is anything to really be proud of right now anyway).  Normals are infinitely worse too since almost every other game there's a 3rd party bot or someone legit trolling (not like wierd team comps like the Vayne jg example above) but like a Draven ADC who builds zero items all game and ints the jinx to hyperfed status before we can even early surrender.  This \"preseason doesn't matter\" mentality is just making the game even more toxic than it normally is.  Tempted to just stop playing until S10 officially starts up because if you dont have a full group then its not worth playing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Upgrades","date":"2019-11-22T08:49:53.413+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yea, I agree. After all of the rank games I played besides one, the quality of the games is not what it was a few weeks back. I'm staying away from ranked until next season. I lost a total of around 120 LP, now on the brink of demoting  into gold","replies":[]},{"poster":"Modnar Erom","date":"2019-11-25T02:23:30.768+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"It is because at the end of every season is when the most accounts get Elo boosted (for the fake rank and rewards).  So now you have a whole bunch of people playing where they don't belong.  And if a human is trash enough to pay for an Elo boost, one really shouldn't expect exemplary behavior from them.\n\nThe sad part is all of this could be avoided with a verified queue.  Imagine no trolls, no boosts, no dodging, stream sniping, or win trading.  All of those are very solvable problems.  And I would wager many people would be more than happy to pay a small fee to take part in the verified queue.  Something like 5 - 10 dollars per split.   Why Riot does not do this is beyond me.  It is just another revenue stream for them, and would dramatically increase the quality of life for non-mouthbreathers.   It is disappointing, but that is typical Riot - disappointment.","replies":[]}]}
