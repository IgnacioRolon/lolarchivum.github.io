I don&#039;t appreciate the all randomness shit, getting a shitpick and going vs enemies with copletely op champs... At least make it where you can select only 10 champs to get randomly picked, not my whole entire fkn champion pool. Enjoy playing yas lmfaoooo. Wait, that&#039;s actually a great idea. LEt us choose which champs can randomly be selected (10, more or less). Maybe bans, idk, but just not this all random crap. Like the case in ARAM... Unlock the entire fkn champ pool if you wanna keep AR URF &quot;balanced&quot; instead of people just getting op champsover again and not getting shitpicks like yas.","replies":[{"poster":"Doseqis","date":"2017-02-25T19:43:30.703+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"pretty much my experience, oh they got an Eve or Galio or Leona congrats you just lose now unless you got the same characters","replies":[{"poster":"Rakans Side Girl","date":"2017-02-27T03:44:13.830+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't forget Warwick.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-02-25T19:42:15.684+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No.\n\nThere is a reason URF is random now.","replies":[{"poster":"Ark Sorcerer","date":"2017-02-25T20:19:05.546+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Which was because URF had tons of OP champions that can abuse this mode and win easily or be a powerful annoyance.","replies":[]}]}]}
