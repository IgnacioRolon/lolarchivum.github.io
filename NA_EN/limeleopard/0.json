When I check control panel it tells me that the game client is not responding. The regular client works just fine. I can login, select games, talk to friends, and proceed through all of champ select with no issues. This is STRICTLY related to the actual game portion.\r\n\r\nI've uninstalled and reinstalled on both my boot drive (SSD) and storage drive (HDD). I've run a clean boot twice. I've checked for corrupt system files in command prompt. And I've been in touch with League Support 3 times. Twice they told me it was trouble connecting to the server, but the third guy was not so sure that was the issue.\r\n\r\nI can't stress enough that I do not even get as far as a black screen. The Legacy client logo doesn't even display on my taskbar.\r\nMost of the fixes I've found usually get that far at least.\r\nI am running windows 10.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-16T16:44:47.773+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The issue you're having sounds like a connection problem to me, in that your client goes into a dormant state and fails to transition to the game server.  If it does struggle through, the black screen would indicate a failure to download assets.  Normally I would advise going over the steps in the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to help, but having a ticket already open is your best bet.  Our tech team can continue working with you to find a resolution, just hit up your specialist with any concerns or questions you have.\n\nI am curious about the 32-bit as well, you may need to [upgrade to 64](https://www.windowscentral.com/how-upgrade-32-bit-64-bit-version-windows-10), but that wouldn't be necessarily related to this specific issue.
