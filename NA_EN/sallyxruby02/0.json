So I went to try it, but the skin doesn't show up. \r\nit's not for sale, which means u can't buy it , cause it doesn't exist anymore....but the point is....if it doesn't exist, why do we keep receiving it if we cannot use it ? \r\nIt's kinda unfair to earned something u cannot use... \r\n\r\nLeague of legends","replies":[{"poster":"Son Golin","date":"2016-04-05T18:13:16.848+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Sallyxruby02,\n\nFrom what you've described, it sounds like you haven't upgraded the skin to a permanent yet. When you have a Skin Shard, you have 4 options:\n1. **Re-roll** - Use 3 Skin Shards and Re-roll them into 1 random Skin Permanent.\n2. **Disenchant** - Convert your Skin Shard into (Orange) Essence which you can use to Upgrade another Skin Shard.\n3. **Activate** - Consume your Skin Shard and rent the skin for 7 days.\n4. **Upgrade** - Consume your (Orange) Essence to convert your Skin Shard into a Skin Permanent.\n\nIf you receive a Skin Shard from a Hextech Chest that you really want, you'll need to Upgrade it into a Skin Permanent and redeem it onto your account. \n\nMore information regarding how Hextech Crafting works can be found in our Knowledge Base article here:\n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207884233-Hextech-Crafting-Guide\n\nIf you believe you've already done this and still cannot use the Badger Teemo skin, please contact my colleagues through the Support Site so we can look into this further:\n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/requests/new","replies":[]}]}
