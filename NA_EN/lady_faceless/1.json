He also wrote Warmother and is one of the most active Riot narrative folk on the SA&amp;S Boards.\n\n> There are two other series, in early production. Hopefully the second series will launch roughly when Ashe: Warmother ends. John O'brian is writing the second series. I wrote the third. We won't be back in the Freljord till after then... but hopefully if this series does well we will be able to return after that.\n\n[Source](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/story-art/luKNAK3m-ashe-warmother-issue-1-avail-nows?comment=000c0000)\n\nAnyway, let’s begin to analysis the cover and what it means.\n\n**The characters of the comic**\n\nSo the look on the cover shows us Zed (surprise), Jhin’s mask, which we can assume is the assassin Zed is after, Akali, Shen, a new person which name is Jovn Tau and probably Kayn which can’t really see here since the cover is cut off. The cover also fits with the information we got from Odin as well.\n\n> […]\n> The Zed comic is, not surprisingly, hyper-focused on Zed. But I will say Zed, Kayn, Akali, Shen, Jovn Tau, and Jhin are all on the cover...\n> […]\n\n[Source](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/story-art/XV5NT7wn-could-shen-and-zed-actually-catch-jhin?comment=0002)\n\nOkay let’s talk about the elephant in the room – Zed’s face reveal. While I’m not against it per se, revealing it on the cover feels incredible anticlimax for me. Not considering I’m really not happy with his face itself, especially his white hair. It looks like something I would expect from a fan artist and not from an official Riot work because the design itself feels to uninspired to be Zed for me.\nAlso, he is missing [his shadow magic tattoos](https://universe.leagueoflegends.com/en_GB/story/champion/zed/) which is a shame because already saw his tattoos in the shown concept arts from the[ /Dev video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqRxNzp9yCI) earlier this year.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/7MG3fuA\n\n**The length of the comic**\n\nThe “1 of 6” means we get 6 issues instead of 5 like the Lux comic. Odin mentioned this a while ago while writing the script. One more issue means one issue more content and I doubt anyone will complain about it.\n\n> […]\n> Zed is spinning up production soon... and I'm not allowed to say much about him. I can say he has 6 scripts done, and first script is locked (I.e. ready for the artist).\n> […]\n\n[Source](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/story-art/qabiFIYq-how-it-can-be-that-we-still-have-no-further-information-regarding-the-upcoming-comics?comment=00040003)\n\n**The (main focus of the) story**\n\nI just add a few comments which made Odin about the comic.\n\n> […]\n> 1) yeah obviously. Lux is next. Then maybe the Zed thing I wrote. (I'm not sure if that is going forward at this point) I can't speak for the Lux comic, but the Zed lets the reader take a deep dive into who he is-- but also what Ionia is like.\n> […]\n\n[Source](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/story-art/oT3p6ZRy-ashe-warmother-issue-4-available-now-in-special-addition-or-free?comment=000400000000000000000000)\n\n> It does contain flashback _scenes_ as typical comic readers and most league players don’t actually know who Zed is, why he fights, or even why he and Shen have beef. (The boards users’ knowledge level is much higher than the average joes—actually most league players knowledge of lore comes **only** from VO)\n> Like the Lux comic, the Zed comic starts in the recent past, but will begin advancing the timeline around its midpoint. But even in this recent past, for the people that already know Zed, Shen, and Jhin’s lores there’s a lot of new stuff you will discover.\n\n[Source](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/story-art/FO8MrxdX-which-story-would-you-like-to-move-forward-after-demacia?comment=00010001)\n\n> […]\n> The Zed comic is, not surprisingly, hyper-focused on Zed.

However, I think the comic will be released in December otherwise we should be able to preorder it on the online comic stores already (which we can't). It makes me sad but at least I will have Realms of Runeterra which should keep me occupied until then.\n\n>The white hair came out of trying to find a way to show Zed as both haunted and exceptional.

It was my headcanon for him because his father had the same hair color. But Pulsefire Shen looked different and it wouldn't have been the first time you made a skin look canon (see Eternal Sword Yi). Also, my Twitter is definitely current not spammed by League fan artists who are so happy to see their headcanon have been proven right. \nShen deserves all the love. He has a tough job and I feel so deeply sorry for him.\n\nI will see how Zed looks in the comic. Again, I really trust your work and I'm incredibly excited to see how you, as writer, see Zed. (Cross my fingers for some Zed &amp; Kayn interact so I actually can see my two eyes how both interact with each other. Because personally I would write their relationship as high key emotional abuse but the canon could prove me wrong).\n\nActually, I do have a different question for you - you mentioned you are not part of the Comic team anymore. Are you allowed to tell for which team you work currently? Back to the champion team?

I had to think for like 5 minutes about whether the system observes \"Lawful\" from his perspective or in a universal sense. Only settled on yes because he wants to make the Shadow Order the dominant order in the Ionia so I couldn't say chaotic.

The only true measure of a soul is the strength of their will.\"\n\nTides of Numenera had an excellent, more nuanced system for assigning character alignments that sold me on the game, shame it didn't do so well financially. Character alignment was keyed to five different \"Tides\" which were distinctly color coded. A characters alignment was decided by a assigning  a Primary and then a Secondary Tide\n\nThe Five Tides are:\n\nGold - Altruism, Charity, Sacrifice and Empathy\nIndigo - Justice, Compromise, Equity, The Greater Good\nBlue - Wisdom, Enlightenment, Mysticism, Curiosity\nRed - Passion, Emotion, Action, Zeal\nSilver - Power, Acclaim, Legacy\n\nSo you could be Gold/Silver Tide a good guy whose actions seem benevolent on the outside, but really their actions are motivated by their own selfish desire or because he's only charitable for pragmatic reasons rather than more genuine ones. The system allows for more flexibility because it isn't rigidly attached to binary world-views, but instead reflects intrinsic motivations and character traits.\n\nSomeone like {{champion:13}} would dominantly be Blue Tide first, being a mage who values knowledge and secondarily would be Indigo because he wants to protect the world from itself and is willing to make great individual sacrifices to do so. His opposite Tides would be Gold because he has trouble meshing well with others as individuals despite, but that doesn't mean he's a bad person. It just means that he has chosen the Greater Good over Empathizing with the individual.\n\nChanging the secondary alignment changes the flavor of the primary. Indigo/Gold ({{champion:86}} ) vs Indigo/Red ({{champion:10}})\n\nI think in this system Zed would be Silver/Red. He seeks and values power and he's passionate about it, displaying the opposite of the Kinkou philosophy.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Erusaurus","date":"2019-10-22T19:37:10.890+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=WAAARGHbobo,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=765RkwlE,comment-id=0007,timestamp=2019-10-22T17:35:02.722+0000)\n>\n> Nice work Lady Faceless!\n> \n> Two very minor corrections.

I mean, we shouldn't judge a book but its cover since I have high hopes but the cover really feels unfitting for Zed.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"4 Step Cadence","date":"2019-10-20T14:54:51.897+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"So there's a chance this could be made available for pre-order/released on my birthday?\nOh, joy...\n\nAnyways.\n****\nEither they made the white hair and red eyes canon because that's the way the community has always draw unmasked Zed, or that's the way he's looked this whole time and we were right all along/called that shit.\n\nEither way, though, I think its fitting.\n\nZed has been under a shit ton of stress for a long time, which ages you physically. I wouldn't say its impossible that his hair grayed/whitened over the years because of that, though I don't think it would be _that_ severe.\n\nHe's also one of original edgelords of LoL. White hair and red eyes is edgy OC material. Let the man be edgy.\n****\nI'm not a fan of that cover. At least, not as it is currently shown.\n\nThe other characters are barely on it. Compare that to the covers of the Lux and Ashe comics, where all the characters had somewhat equal space on the cover. The only prominent characters are Jhin(and that's only his mask) and Zed. The rest may as well not even be there.\n\nAlso, not a fan of Zed's \"flying superhero\" pose. It just feels out of character for him to be posed like that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Troll Slaiyer","date":"2019-10-20T21:07:32.130+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"i expect to see zed","replies":[{"poster":"ZackTheWaffleMan","date":"2019-10-22T17:38:07.364+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't know if Riot's bold enough to go there.

Akali, Shen and Zed have always been my favorite characters. I have to say though, I never expected Shen to be a ginger, even though it was mentioned. \n\nWhite hair on Zed will make him look even older than he is, but I'm sure a lot of thought has been put into their designs. The only problem I can see here is that white hair is very noticeable in a crowd so I bet Zed is going to wear his mask everywhere.\nI'm also very curious to see who Jovn Tau is. My initial guess was that he is the new fist of shadow.\nbtw, is that purple thing under Akali Kennen? WAAARGHbobo did not mention Kennen when he was talking about the cover. So it's very unlikely. \n\nAs someone who loves all of these characters, I hope all of them get enough screen time and development to let us understand their motives and personalities. Also some real interactions between them would be very nice. Champion interactions in game are not really reliable for knowing their relationships and personalities. Akali for example is very hostile towards Shen even though  he is her teacher and they parted on good terms.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jeddy017","date":"2019-10-21T02:39:35.855+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have they announced who the next comic series, after {{champion:238}}, will centered around?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jhins Girlfriend","date":"2019-10-20T16:26:57.415+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"Gotta be honest I'm not liking Zed's face at all.

You can compare how Sylas looks in the game/splash arts to the Lux comic and notice a big difference, with comic!Sylas being well...a lot uglier, to put it bluntly.
