If you want to change it, then (for Win10):\n\n1. Go to the start menu\n2. Click the settings cog shape (just above the power icon)\n3. Click System\n4. Click Default Apps\n5. Look for the 'Web Browser' entry and select the browser you'd rather use.\n\nOther operating systems have similar steps, but the internet can help you out there :D\n\n(Also, yay for a link to Universe!  Finally!)","replies":[{"poster":"Nyloaf","date":"2018-02-22T18:29:36.665+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually tried that before, tried most everything else too and it still hasn't worked.

FIGHTING!\n\n1. Open the start menu and type \"Control Panel\".  Open it.\n2. Choose \"View By\" and choose an icon size so it's not viewing by Category.\n3. Click \"Default Programs\"\n4. Click \"Set your default programs\"\n5. Wait a bit.\n6. Find the browser you want in the list on the left, and select it.  Go down to the bottom of the window and click \"Set this program as default\"\n\nGood luck?  (Sorry if this is old news to you.  Hope you manage to get an upgraded machine soon!)","replies":[{"poster":"Nyloaf","date":"2018-02-22T21:09:13.186+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"ive tried this before too- i remember this one specifically! i thought it almost worked at first but for some strange reason whenever i restart my pc, the settings revert and I have to do it all over again.
