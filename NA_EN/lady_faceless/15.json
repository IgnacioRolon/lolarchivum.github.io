We wouldn't push Volibear through first if we weren't confident in his direction just because he had more votes. Both have started early exploration at the same time, so either could be first.","replies":[{"poster":"The Iceborn","date":"2019-06-01T10:38:42.738+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Reav3,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=qYWkz0uu,comment-id=0002000100020000,timestamp=2019-06-01T00:17:37.279+0000)\n>\n> It won't be a package deal and it will be based on which one we have a solid design direction for first.
