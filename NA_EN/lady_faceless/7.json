Are you going to evolve into making an MMORPG from the story line.\n\nBefore WoW there was Warcraft.  It played a lot like LoL in a way. (few spells, maps, background, etc) Then Warcarft 2 and 3.  With their games they had a very detail and interesting back story and champs.  This lead way to World of Warcraft.  They carried everything they worked on and learn to evolved it into a WoW.\n\nLeague already had back stories, maps, and interest interactions with emotional stories.  TWOTLK imo was where the game left the basic story (had a lot of added things) of the Warcraft games.  Sure Rag, Kaz, etc really weren't in the story but added in.\n\nNow I look at these awesome maps and back stories (well fiddle is still just standing around) but you have the hardest part of a MMORPG done.  and interesting story line and different characters interacting.  All you need is a bad guy win the rift and cause chaos upon the world.  Force the champions to ban together for a new fight.\n\nTo be honest we (the gaming community) need a new one.  Its been a while.  New games don't have the Brand name nor the stories that people already know to succeed.  That is one reason wow did so well.  You have brand name with loyalty.  Use it to your advantage.\n\nSure it will be harder than that.  But you already have a platform and understanding of on-line game and the tech aspects of it.  And imo is should be subscriptions base.  To get the money for the needed content and updating.\n\nJust wonder if you have talked about the competitive advantages you have in the field compared to start ups.  And possibly making a transition like wow did.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":" CURSEÐ REVENANT","date":"2018-07-24T16:03:18.314+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"Now the big question is, \n\nIs Runeterra flat?","replies":[{"poster":"LeaoC","date":"2018-07-24T19:20:13.956+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"I for one welcome our Flatterran overlords","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Fasmodey","date":"2018-07-24T15:13:19.979+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"IT IS EVEN BETTER THAN I EXPECTED WTF","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ebonmaw Dragon","date":"2018-07-24T15:13:36.287+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"WAIT WAIT WAIT!! \n\n\nThere is information about Bandle City!\n\nGovernance:\nNONE\n\nRIP Mayor of Bandle City.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheWildPenguin","date":"2018-07-24T16:06:20.379+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"To the Rioters who worked on the map update:\nmarry me.\nyes, all of you.\nI love you.\nu da bess, was worth waiting the {{item:3027}}  !","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Decided","date":"2018-07-24T16:34:55.815+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}} \n\nGlad you like it!","replies":[{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2018-07-24T17:27:41.940+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Would it ever be possible to be able to search for the location or origins of a champ ?\n\nIt will be nice for the folks new to lore to identify where their favourite champions are from.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Decided","date":"2018-07-24T18:10:40.551+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Our intention is to continue to add content and features to the map, although what and when is still in the works.\nWe appreciate your feedback and suggestions and will definitely keep it in mind it as we move forward!","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"IllusionLord333","date":"2018-07-24T17:38:39.080+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot, you guys have outdone yourselves!\nAs a lore fanatic, this map was a great boost to my knowledge of Runeterra as a whole.\nI really like all the new concepts and art you guys added to each region and it added greatly to the depth.\nMy favorite addition was probably the art tied to the history of the Shadow Isles (Blessed Isles).\nAlready two of my favorite factions (Noxus and the Void) have gotten lore updates, and now the Shadow Isles has gotten a decent sized one too.\nI am exited to see what will be added to the map next, great job!","replies":[{"poster":"Riot wuddaheq","date":"2018-07-24T18:20:43.227+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{sticker:sg-jinx}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lyxana","date":"2018-07-24T15:49:16.483+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did anyone else notice that Swain is invading Ionia?
