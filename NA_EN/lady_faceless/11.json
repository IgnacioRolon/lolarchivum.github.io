That coin at the end really sealed the deal on Fizz being an entity that gets kicks from watching people live in terror.\n\nI disagree. I took it as Fizz was trying to compensate the man for the fun time but because of his trickster nature the man took it to be the coin that cost him his ship. It emphasises that your legacy precedes you more than your reality. I don't think Fizz was ever doing anything wrong.","replies":[{"poster":"midnight oil24","date":"2018-06-01T12:25:32.200+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's definitely a possibility, though I think that just because Fizz didn't see what he was doing as wrong doesn't mean it wasn't wrong since it was still psychologically scarring Lars.
