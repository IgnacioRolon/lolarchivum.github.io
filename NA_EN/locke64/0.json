It has several buttons mapping to spells, items, etc. and most importantly it can slide to move the camera. Now this peripheral has stopped working on PBE, and if that gets pushed to Live I'll be forced to adjust to using strictly the keyboard and mouse.\n\nSwitching from buttons to keys isn't too bad, but I'm at a loss regarding what to do with the camera. How do most keyboard users control the camera? I find that using the mouse (edge of screen) is terribly inefficient as I'd like to be moving and aiming skillshots at the same time. I'm so used to controlling the camera with my left hand, so I tried mapping it to WASD. But now I'm making too many mistakes differentiating camera keys from skill keys. How do you people do it?!?\n\n@RIOT please don't disable controllers on Live, and please re-enable them in PBE...","replies":[{"poster":"NoopMoney","date":"2014-05-01T23:06:06.946+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Lock, I just got my hands on a Microsoft Strategic Commander today and I was able to get it to work on both Live and PBE. If you're still having trouble with it you might want to try re-installing the driver and remapping the keys from scratch.\n\nFor me, I pretty much cut my gaming teeth on RTS games so I tend to use the mouse and spacebar to control my camera. If I were you I'd keep trying LtRandolph's suggestion of camera on WASD and skills on 1234 and see how you find it.","replies":[{"poster":"Locke64","date":"2014-05-10T01:33:56.708+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry for the late update, I haven't had a chance lately to try this or play. I installed the driver (v1.3) on another computer along with the PBE client and updated Live to 4.7 (from some pre-S4 version, haven't played on that computer in about a year). MSC didn't work on either client. (It did work outside of the clients though, tested by using it to type in a text document.)\n\nThen I reinstalled the driver on my main computer and remapped keys like you said, and updated both LoL clients, and it's the same as before - Live works, PBE doesn't.\n\nSo MSC works with Live on one computer but not on another, and it doesn't work with PBE on either computer.\n\nThe computer Live works on is running Windows 7 Professional, the one it doesn't work on is Windows 7 Home Premium, if that's helpful.","replies":[{"poster":"NoopMoney","date":"2014-05-16T01:55:47.467+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you tried checking your keybindings in League of Legends?

I can't even use the controller to type in the AIR client (e.g. in search fields) so in-game bindings aren't the issue.\n\nTo put things in perspective, the software also hasn't worked for several other games (MapleStory, Mabinogi, and I just tried Dawngate last night), but it has worked for others (pretty sure it worked for StarCraft 2 but it's been a while) and it's worked in PBE until just recently. I'll admit it's more likely a problem with the Strategic Engine software than all of these games (though I think at least MapleStory explicitly blocks controllers).\n\nYou may find the middle section of this thread informative: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/microsoft.public.windows.vista.hardware_devices/IGcXDPi8tsI%5B1-25-false%5D\n\nI'd give up and get a Razer but I have no guarantee that that'll work in all the games I play and I don't play them much anyway so it might end up being a waste of money.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"LtRandolph","date":"2014-04-29T21:17:07.950+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there.

I've found it's far easier if you can move your cursor (and the move the screen with it) if you don't have to move your mouse very much.\n\nWhile playing my mouse rarely moves more than an inch in any direction. If you don't lift and move the mouse and just keep moving it in the direction you want it to go it's going to make your reactions very slow.Meaning it's faster to lift and move, lift and move than it is to just keep pushing.
