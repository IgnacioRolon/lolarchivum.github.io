There may be very few niches certain champions better occupy but over the course of the game, the likelihood that the opportunity for those niches to shine is much lower. In this case, though Fiddles has a great **great** single target shutdown in his Q and an awesome AoE damage ult, the niches that supports fill often involve more than damage and 1 form of CC (ignoring silence). So \"meta\" picks are helpful because, typically, these are champions the community believes are the best at the series of niches best suited for the game. \n\nThat said, your Ashe was an idiot. People play best when they play the characters they know how to play and play well. Suboptimal picks don't matter at most levels of play and at higher levels of play, there's more coordination so typical meta picks don't apply in the same way. Sure, if everyone was an absolutely perfect player, Fiddlesticks might not be the \"best\" support nor Warwick the \"best\" jungler but we're not perfect and these characters fulfill their niches well.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Godhri","date":"2015-05-02T18:31:58.828+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Idk. I think Fiddles is way better than Sona as a support pick. His Fear CC can peel way harder and is available way more often than Sona's Ult CC.

The enemy team was full of assasins and just burst team fighting champs. I told my team to pick a siege comp, and avoid fighting all game. Everyone picked a champ with waveclear ( Gragas, Corki, lissandra, Sona, maokai) vs ( zed, thresh, ezrael, riven, sejuani) , we got every tower except base ones in under 20 minutes, but then my team started fighting under their towers :/ we were really ahead and losing 2 fights put is badly behind. We lost the game cus team stopped caring about towers and just kept trying to fight. Point being, sometimes team comp alone can win you games IF YOU PLAY THE COMP. We could've ended super easily but you know, silver players gotta be silver. Even if your teammate says he's not good with a champ you select, as long as they play the role appropriately you have a higher chance of winning. I know some people say \" pick champs your comfortable with\" but sometimes that champ just won't help the team as much. If we need waveclear and we tell you to play ziggs, but you're better with fizz.... And we already have a bruiser top or jungle, it hurts the team. Just pick ziggs and spam q and e until you get tower.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rueciel","date":"2015-05-03T08:40:27.335+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because league teams are made up of people.
