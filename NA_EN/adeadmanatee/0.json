I used all of my remaining blue essence (20250, to be precise) yesterday to unlock as many champions under 4800 as possible; I was hoping to get a few good deals from the mystery champion shards before the store closed, but now all I've done is prevented myself from taking advantage of the new deal.\r\nI don't even want the champions I purchased; I was just trying to get them out of the way so I could spend blue essence more efficiently.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-10T01:25:45.490+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmmm I kinda see where you're coming from since this change was really out of the blue for everyone.
