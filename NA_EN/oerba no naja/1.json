Your latest patches introduced tons of drastic changes (especially on those 'Juggernauts') and you're saying you have nothing planned for Cass due to the season coming to an end? Do you have any idea how that sounds?\n\nCassiopeia was downright abandoned and left to rot by Stashu, since then no one felt obliged to do anything for her. She's been an extreme nich√©pick for a long time now after the neverending wave of nerfs she has received, right now she's almost as bad as she was when the rework hit her. **Her win- and pickrate are evidence enough of that - not even her dedicated playerbase can make her work anymore.**\n\nBy leaving Cass on her own you're hardly any better than the person who singlehandely destroyed this champion. She probably is the most unpopular midlaner in the game judging by the way you're setting your priorities. If this isn't a clear sign of favoritism, I don't know what. **She needs a proper rework this time, and that very soon.**\n\nI'm tired of my main getting the short end of the stick constantly just because her name isn't Ahri, Fizz or Zed. **If all of her counterpicks are extremely popular champions, how on earth is she supposed to survive in the meta?** Can you explain this to me?","replies":[{"poster":"Oerba No Naja","date":"2015-08-26T15:59:01.320+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you are right mate .\n\nit is a smurf account ? ^^","replies":[{"poster":"Canastus","date":"2015-08-26T16:32:38.641+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I've created this account back then when people we're stuck with the old forums.

Don't expect me to play with this acc though, my ping is simply terrible over there.\n\nOver the years I managed to build up something like a reputation which is why I'm sticking with this account for any discussion on the boards.

Change the passive so that instead of being a ball of stats passive, it increases the duration of the poison DOT; adjust base cooldowns and ratios accordingly. The E reset feels really really nice right now, and I like the idea that hitting an enemy with twin fang increases your poison's damage. Anyways, just my two cents.","replies":[]}]}
