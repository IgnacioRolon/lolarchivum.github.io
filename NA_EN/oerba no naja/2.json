This spell is core to her kit because its a reliant tool that can do what poison cant , it assurs all ins , kiting , proper executes and gives her sustained dmg ( even the old cassio could build spell vamp , it was not optimal but good . ) it also make {{champion:69}} unique \n\n  * Her poison ( {{champion:6}} : thanks captain obvious ) . Well it fits totaly with her theme and make her gameplay even more unique .. but what makes cassio realy exiting to play is the duo poison + twin fangs , this combo is just {{champion:69}}  .\n\n  * Her spammy nature , yeah . Twin Fang spam (along with Noxious Blast spam) is iconic to Cassio  when those abilities are spammed together she&#039;s one of the few mages in the game that can actually kite out and duel other champs that most mages struggle handling . Thats why cassio can be played top lane btw . \n\n  * The ultimate is just perfect for her theme and gameplay + its by far the most charismatic spell in the game . \n\n**2.What issue bothers you the most when playing them?**\n\n   * THE PASSIVE : \n       I hate this passive in fact it was just an argument for her murdering during patch 4.16 :\n     this passive : is responsible for her terrible powercurve ,  for her unique build path , for her delayed   powerspike\n      And this passive is just a bull of stats wich i think is a bad design . \n      **I want a cass thats strong throughout the game .** \n\n   * UNIQUE BUILD PATH : \n         you MUST max e in first place and  thats the thing i dislike the most when i play cassiopeia is that i have no      choice  i cant max q over e  against certain matchup .. \nAlso because of her passive and super low ratios you have to build only ap to be relevant . The old cassio could    build cdr item and even a {{item:3068}} ( hard games only {{champion:79}}  )\n\n   * TOO MUCH TWIN FANGS NOT ENOUGH POISON : lel\nI think you saw enough threads about that with all the possible argues @RiotRepertoir\nTon of reasons for saying that twin fang centric sucks , i will make it shorter and just give you the opinion we see the less . \n\n         * because its not enough mentioned :\nHer miasma is propably the worst part of her kit after her passive , its just useless.\nIt used to be a zoning tool for sieging / and also in teamfights ( because it dealt decent dmgs ) i rly miss this aspect of cassi , people could ( currently ) stand in for the full duration without being worried . \nShe cant control her own lane / objectives and siege  , the push / depush is impossible with poison only : Win your lane or be useless sitting under tower for all the game . \n\n   * MANA : \nShe has mana issues. Her only form of mana sustain is killing a minion with an E. If she is not fighting near minions, and if she cannot afford to use an E to kill a minion, she is going to run out of mana ( even with a tear (wich is not full stacked ) ) . Its also the reason why cassiopeia got a restricted build , she needs a giant mana pool .\n\n   * The ultimate :\nI dont have a  real issue with this spell but it feels like the reward for stunning people is low . I say that because the spell has a &quot; big &quot; delay , a short range and the stun is rly not easy to hit against players with a brain / mobility champ. I dont want the quol to change because i dont want to cassio to become a {{champion:1}}/{{champion:54}}  skill cap tier , but i feel like it should be more rewarding  .\n\n***** What is expected from this rework ? *\n\n** *  A better poison with new mechanics ( miasma) **\n**  * Flexible build path , Being able to max q over e or  e over q **\n**  * Less dependance on Twin fangs .**\n**  *  A new passive **\n**  * the ultimate should feel more cohesive to the rest of the kit and rewarding **\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n                                                                                REWORK : \n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nPassive : The serpent embrace .\nCasting a spell causes any subsequent spellcasts within 5 seconds to cost 10% less mana and grants 2% spell vamp . stacking up to 5 times \nCassiopeias poison deals more damage up to 20%  to low champions healt   and applies grievous wounds . \n\nSry but i had no idea about a passive that fits with her identity and solve her issues . Only the old one can do it .. \n\nQ- Noxious Blast : almost unchanged \nBase dmg :  75 / 115 / 155 / 195 / 235  \n% AP ratios : 50 / 60 / 65 / 70 \nmouv speed boost :  15 / 20 / 25 / 30 \nWell i wanted to make it scale so its worth to maxe it first , and i didnt want to make her super lane bully . Mana costs may be looked at .\n\nW- Miasma. \nIts 2 in 1 with an activation you will understand . \nCassiopeia throws a puddle of poison at  a  location which expands over 7 seconds , the puddle expands  faster depending on how much champs are standing in it and it applies a small poison with a special effect .\n(1) deals  25/35/45/55/65 + 15 % ap  it also applies mental paralyze wich slow the move speed and couldowns of the enemys ( not sure about that one )  for  25/ 30/ 35/ 40/45%\nsecond activation  , Poison Cloud : \n Cassio have to go near to the puddle then  she smash the ground with her tail ( you gotta aim a location , it has a long range) making her poisson to go in the air and take the form of a cloud wich is a lot bigger than the puddle at max potential  but deals less dmg .  The cloud applies a poison .\n(2) The poison deals  10/15/25/30/35 + 10 % ap , and it applies a blind . like the blind of graves or quinn wich Reduce vision \n\nE- Twin fangs :  stays the same with less frequency but better base dmg .\n50 / 85 / 120 / 155 / 190 + 55% ap ratio . \nInteractions with poisons : \nQ  : poison dmg increased  \nW (2 ) : hiting 2 twin fangs at least  will root the target for x duration , this effect has a couldown     \nIf the enemy is poisoned by both poison , Noxious blast got the priority . \n\nThe spell goes on couldown when it hits a target . + the travel time of twin fangs is a little bit longer . \nThis is exactly how was her old e ( wich was balanced )  , if riot is going to nerf her frequency ( wich will happen ) i wish they use this quol change instead of a direct number nerf . ****\n\nR- Petrifying Gaze     added a pasive \nACTIVE: After a brief delay, Cassiopeia blasts enemies in a cone , dealing magic damage and Slow them by 60% for 2 seconds. Enemies facing her directly are instead  for the same duration.\ndeals 150 / 250 / 350 + 60 % ap\nPassive: Cassiopeia&#039;s curse : applies a litlle poison to stunned targets , the poison shreds  10 / 20 / 40 %   Armor and Magic resist for the duration of the poison ( 2 sec , same as the stun )  . If the target dies during the poison duration , it will leave a litlle cloud of cassiopeia&#039;s curse at this location . \n\nThanks for reading and please give me your feedback  :D\n\n:* \nhttp://imgur.com/ohTjyYZ","replies":[{"poster":"RiotRepertoir","date":"2016-02-10T05:33:30.456+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":1,"body":"> * What is expected from this rework ? *\n\n\n> * A better poison with new mechanics ( miasma) \n* Flexible build path , Being able to max q over e or e over q \n* Less dependance on Twin fangs .\n* A new passive \n* the ultimate should feel more cohesive to the rest of the kit and rewarding\n\nThis is pretty in line with what I understand to be a viable direction for Cass.\n\nAs far as a better poison goes, this is something I'm pretty interested in exploring, and I agree that Miasma seems like a good place to start with that, though it's possible the passive could be a viable path here as well.\n\nThe notes about being able to max Q or E seems like it goes pretty hand-in-hand with less dependence on Twin Fang. I do feel like it's worth mentioning here that my understanding of Twin Fang is that it should remain a spammy ability, but that it shouldn't be so dominant as to make Cass feel one-dimensional, which I do believe most players think she is.\n\nEither a new passive or a modified one is definitely a possibility, though I think there are some positive effects of the current passive that would be nice to retain (not needing to build a ton of CDR, some sort of sustain for a shorter-range mage).\n\nAs to the ultimate feeling more cohesive and rewarding, I agree it would be nice to blend some of the poison/petrify identities going on in her kit, but I do currently see this as a lower priority than some of the other stuff mentioned here. As to the reward of Petrifying Gaze specifically, I know players have issues with how easy it can feel to outplay the skill as an opponent in some scenarios, but I do feel like the spell is actually really rewarding when I get opportunities to use it cleverly by ducking into brush or behind terrain.\n\nThanks for the thoughtful write-up!","replies":[{"poster":"ShadowParker","date":"2016-02-10T05:55:56.274+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Can you elaborate why you think the passive has some benefits?

The things I think the passive does which may be missed if gone are in providing some sort of sustain (since she's pretty low range for a mage) and giving her some access to CDR which would otherwise feel suboptimal given the nature of Twin Fang's cooldown-reducing mechanic.\n\nEh, obviously the passive gives her very powerful stats but that doesn't mean it's actually useful for her to have - for the most part I think Cass fans would gladly accept losing everything the passive currently grants her if it meant she got back what had to be removed from her to get that passive. Look:\n\n1. +30% AP: Only necessary because you gutted her ratios almost across the board. Make her ratios normal again and it can go.\n2. Healing on Twin Fang (effectively 10% Spell Vamp on one ability): Only necessary because you completely removed her ability to damage enemies from a safe range. Make her poisons worthwhile again and you can remove this.\n3. + 25% CDR: Only necessary because you increased her poison cooldowns - this only exists so that you can gate her 3 second Q CD behind something.\n\nIf you give her the ability to do stuff from long range again then she won't need sustain anymore and if you shorten her poison cooldowns again then she won't care about not having cooldown reduction either. I realise that what I'm saying mostly comes down to \"These stats are bad because they're gated\" but I think it's very difficult to separate a passive that gives you free stats ... after you've fulfilled a certain condition, without it feeling gated. I think I speak for every Cass fan when I say I'd like a passive that gives me gameplay, not numbers. I've no interest whatsoever in random free stuff.","replies":[]},{"poster":"so chad","date":"2016-02-10T16:05:45.243+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is one of the largest problems with the Cassiopeia rework - everything you think is good about it was already in her kit.

It just seems wierd to give CDR to a mage who is supposed to be able to continously cast spells)\n\nAs for her other abilities: \nMiasma could use some work to further her poison identity, though I would prefer if it could keep (at least some of) its utility. It's one of the easier ways for Cass to deal with mobile champions. (Just try hitting your Q on a Fizz while he's doing his E+Q combo, compared to using miasma to do the job. Miasma is a lot easier :P + it gives vision, zoning, kiting capabilities etc.)\n\nAs for her Q and her E, I'd actually prefer if as little as possible happened to her Q. I do agree that her E (Twin fang) is too overwhelming at the moment (compared to the rest of her kit), though if the E spam dissapears then Riot pretty much just used a \"delete\" function on my favourite champion. It's pretty much like saying \"We wanted to improve the first half of Cass' identity, so we just removed the second half\".

Oh, and no \"Ryze passive stacking\" mechanic please :) )\n\nAlso, do you have an estimate for when we can see/read some of your/Riot's proposed changes/champion kits?","replies":[]},{"poster":"ItemsGuy","date":"2016-02-10T14:37:10.521+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"(This gets a bit involved so there's a TL;DR at the bottom!)\n\nI'm not an ultra-dedicated Cass player so I may not have the insight that some of these guys have, but I have a few suggestions as far as how all of these could be made possible without warping Cass too much or adding too many weird tertiary systems. (This is also assuming that you want to reach all of the goals on that bullet list)\n\nOne thing that could be done to keep Cass more focused around poison and its effects while both still maintaining the core of her play-pattern and keeping her progress path flexible (as opposed to the extremes of her current \"You Gotta Max It\" Twin Fangs or having her only ever want to max her Q and W poisons), could be to have Twin Fangs act as more of an enabler for her poisons, rather than a flat reward for landing one.\n\nRather than intense single-target DPS with Twin Fangs and poison with flat effects, have each poison have two \"stages\" - the first stage, where the DoT is first applied and is causing its normal effect, and an advanced stage, where the poison either becomes more powerful or gains an additional effect (ex. Q could begin dealing bonus % max health damage or ignore a portion of MR, W could reduce attackspeed or periodically apply a brief root). Her Twin Fangs, as opposed to being a main tool for DPS, would then instead be used to advance these poisons - refreshing their duration on-hit and applying a stacking mark that sets each poison to its advanced stage once it's hit a certain count (like how Darius gets that AD boost when he fully stacks his bleed on someone).\n\nTo prevent this gameplay from only being unlocked with the inclusion of Twin Fangs, it could be possible to have the system work universally, so with a single type of mark that is applicable when the target has either Q or W's poison applied, that advances both poisons when fully stacked; additionally, these marks could be immediately and quickly applied with Twin Fangs, but could also be slowly applied by maintaining either of her poisons (so chaining Q and W repeatedly could allow skilled Cass players to activate the mark from further away than usual, if their opponent sticks around). \n\nThere's also the question of whether it should be a flat DPS effect; having a more powerful DoT that can be constantly maintained has its own appeal, but there's also the possibility that her gameplay pattern could be something along the lines of \"apply the DoTs, fill the mark, and then have a powerful \"advanced\" poison with a set duration - rinse and repeat\" to exist as a bit of a more drawn-out skirmishing pattern.\n\nAs far as petrification goes, it's true that her ult (or any sort of stun whatsoever) is helpful when it comes to getting poisons on someone and throwing a hundred Twin Fangs at them, or literally anything else a champion might want to do, although the way it's presented now - both mechanically and thematically - it's a bit out of left-field, despite the connections to Medusa and so on.\n\nThat being said, \"petrification\" could still be a part of Cass's kit, but it should be completely tied to her poison theme. So, rather than the whole \"Hey look at me when I'm screaming (unless you have LCS reaction time and render Cass's ult useless)\" thing, it could perhaps be tied to the \"curse\" theme that her current Innate passive tries to demonstrate, or simply be a result of Cass's poisons. As an ult, I could see it as a sort of single-target debuff that applies a powerful stun after being \"fed\" enough of Cass's poison effects - so lets say it requires 10 pips to fully trigger, with 1 pip being satisfied for every second her target remains affected by Q or W (so 2 pips per second with both), with double pips per poison if they're in their advanced stage. So, let's say you've been doing a good job as Cass and your target has 2 advanced poisons on them (either through high-risk Twin Fang spam or just keeping someone in your poisons during a teamfight) and you pop this sucker, 2.5 seconds later and you've got someone who is very, very stunned.\n\nSo I guess at this point, it looks like this kit could be summarized as thus:\n\n**Passive: Poison \"upgrade\" mechanic**, interacts with literally all of her other abilities in a meaningful way either directly (Q, W, E) or indirectly (R) - mostly saying this because it's actually something that bugs me a little about Tahm Kench's E and R\n\n**Q: Normal DoT poison**, damage increases in some way or another in its advanced state; max this if you need a lot of damage and you need it early (might still apply the speed boost, although that could also be moved to E to make it somewhat useful without Q/W applied)\n\n**W: Slowing DoT field**, debilitating effects increase in some way or another in its advanced state; max this if you're in a bad matchup, need to fill in more of a supportive mage role (like Lux), or just want dudes to be really, really slow\n\n**E: Twin Fangs, helps advance Q and W**; max this if you want to advance poisons more quickly (probably without the cooldown-on-hit mechanic, most likely completely/partially refreshes DoTs on-hit for ease-of-use; rank up could decrease cooldown and/or amplify the poison refresh)\n\n**R: Cool snake curse to a single target, applies a powerful stun after being sated by poison effects** (possibly an additional effect upon expiring, since it has a significant prerequisite and a stun long enough to offset it might be overkill; solution could be to just give it an overall lower cooldown which would also fit into her less Veigar-tier bursty nature)\n\nWhile a few new mechanics are added, this should actually overall be a less complex kit than what Cass has now, due to everything being connected to that poison upgrade mechanic in some way - if you're having trouble against Cass, you don't need to have all of her tooltips memorized to know that you should back off if she's building up her poison on you.\n\nAdditionally, this should satisfy the want for **1) a better poison with new mechanics** (poisons are now the main focus, with E and R acting as enablers/rewards for smart use of them),** 2) flexible build path** (every basic ability should now in theory have a situation where one would want to max it first, or at least faster than they might otherwise), **3) less dependence on Twin Fangs** _as Cass's main source of damage_ (it's an ability on her kit, there should still be some dependence on it), **4) a new passive** (and one with much clearer and more immediate gameplay implications), and **5) an ultimate that coheres more with the kit** and rewards Cass more for engaging in the kind of gameplay that surrounds the rest of her kit.\n\nThis is a bit long so\n\n**TL;DR** - By replacing Cass's current passive with one that allows her poisons to become more powerful with exposure, and changing Twin Fangs from a raw DPS ability enabled by poisons to an ability that helps make those poisons stronger, as well as giving her an ult that is more dependent on her poisons and rewards her for using them well, her rework could turn her into a mage who is completely focused around their poions while still retaining some of the core identity and play patterns she has been characterized by since her release.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LoquaciousKumqat","date":"2016-02-10T21:30:45.990+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RiotRepertoir,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=VluE0x7x,comment-id=000d,timestamp=2016-02-10T05:33:30.456+0000)\n>\n> * Flexible build path , Being able to max q over e or e over q \n> * Less dependance on Twin fangs .\n> * A new passive \n> * the ultimate should feel more cohesive to the rest of the kit and rewarding\n> \n> This is pretty in line with what I understand to be a viable direction for Cass.\n> \n> As far as a better poison goes, this is something I'm pretty interested in exploring, and I agree that Miasma seems like a good place to start with that, though it's possible the passive could be a viable path here as well.\n> \n> The notes about being able to max Q or E seems like it goes pretty hand-in-hand with less dependence on Twin Fang.

Instead of Twin Fangs being \"how cass kills stuff,\" it feels like it should be a \"kindly fuck off\" to anyone who gets too close, kinda like actual snakes. \nIt'd be super cool if Twin Fangs got a damage amp depending on how close someone was to you. It'd give it a real identity aside from her poison as well, since maxing it first means you're going to be trying to walk up to people and wreck them, while maxing a poison first means you're going to be trying to keep people away. \n\nAnd the passive is just one big clusterfuck. \nA) 25% cdr is a nightmare for ocd. What madman decided that would be a good idea? If you want max cdr, you _must_ waste 5%. IT FEELS BAD MAN. \nB) Dominates your early playstyle such that you must be a bully with your poison or risk not hitting your power curve. And god help you if you get behind in lane such that you can't poison safely. \nC) PLAY THE CARNIVAL MINI GAME FOR RAAAAAAAAAAAW POOOOWEEEEEEER. Yeah. It feels bad. You play a mini game and receive raw power. It's not even a curve. At some indeterminate point in a game, you may get a ridiculous damage amp, depending on how well you played a mini game. \n\nThe old passive felt good. It had one big problem, and that was that you needed to Q every few seconds to keep the stacks going, because wasting mana on self Q's was more cost effective than not. \nAt the same time though, its problem is \"you had to cast more spells.\" That's an infinitely better problem than anything in the current passive. \n\nAs an aside, it'd be really nice if her ultimate had a small circle around cass herself. A lot of the time, I'll miss because they happen to be pressing their face in my butt.

I'll give it to you that I didn't read everything, but this came off as an immediate problem:\n\n>Passive : The serpent embrace .\nCasting a spell causes any subsequent spellcasts within 5 seconds to cost 10% less mana and grants 2% spell vamp . stacking up to 5 times\nCassiopeias poison deals more damage up to 20% to low champions healt and applies grievous wounds .\n\nThis passive would be either completely useless or require the rest of her kit to be completely useless. Allow me to explain.\n\nIssue 1: The Mana reduction.\n\nMana reduction was a feature of Cassiopeia's old passive, and it completely screwed people over when they tried to make use of it. It sounds good on paper for early game harass (If you harass them alot, then you will save mana.) \n\nHowever, the downside to this is that in order for this passive to be balanced, the mana reduction stacks cant be up for very long, or else it will seem like Cassiopeia has free infinite mana. This gets her kit or passive gutted right off the bat.\n\nOn top of that, if the passive stacks aren't up for very long, then you have to constantly burn mana in order to keep them up and ticking, this means that in the early game you won't have much use out of your passive since you don't have a buttload of mana and mana regen to cover your problems and allow for sustainable stacking.\n\nThis would effectively make Cassiopeia exactly the same as her current passive: A useless DOT mage early and an unstoppable death machine late. (If fed.)\n\nSo, in the end, it's better to skip mana reduction passives. They either screw the kit over in terms of mana costs, or they screw the passive over by forcing it to be useless.\n\nIssue 2: The free items baked in.\n\n10% spell vamp, grievous wounds, and 20% damage to low health champions? That's {{item:3145}}, {{item:3165}} and a situational DFG rolled into one! You've gotta realize how crazy that sounds, right?
