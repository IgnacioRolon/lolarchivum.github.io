Yes, I understand that change is occasionally necessary, and apparently Cass was too much like a lane bully with her old kit, but I feel that the rework didn't actually solve any of her problems, and added new ones. Remember, she got nerfed into trash-tier after her rework (which required about 5 buffs from her release rework state) because she was too much like a lane bully; considering the rework was aimed at avoiding that, it's clearly been a failure from that perspective. It's a failure from a theme perspective, too; all of her VOs, both pre-and-post rework, revolve around her being manipulative and poisonous. The rework based her entire kit around a non-poison ability that is direct and to the point. And in terms of uniqueness, we lost one of our few DoT mages for what is essentially an ADC with a worse autoattack. \n\nMy current problems with Cass are:\nA) E. It is basically her entire kit at this point. Q is to speed yourself up to keep in range and enable resets, W is to slow down the enemy to keep in range and enable resets, R is to do the same thing. This is annoying because it is by far the least interesting part of her kit. If I wanted to hit someone a lot with a targeted ability, I'd play an ADC!\n\nB) The passive. This is mostly come from an amateur game design perspective, not a gameplay one, because it has no gameplay. It's an arbitrary gating; a way to let you 'unlock' and start being super mega badass without actually doing anything differently. At least Veigar and Nasus have to farm stacks; Cass just gets it by...poisoning her enemies. Which she was gonna do anyway. It doesn't help that, instead of having a singular, granular benefit, like Veig and Nasus, she instead gets breakpoints that add seemingly random stuff to her kit (free CDR! Lifesteal!) in addition to the bonus AP.\n\nC) She has mana issues. Her only form of mana sustain is killing a minion with an E. If she is not fighting near minions, and if she cannot afford to use an E to kill a minion, she is going to run out of mana. Even when she was SUPER BROKEN OP enough to warrant dumpstering she ran out of mana whenever she tried to kill anything that didn't die in 3 or so Es.\n\nD) I don't think Riot understands her theme. Like, I get I harped on his often enough, and he doesn't deserve all the hate he gets, but it's clear Stashu did not understand why some people liked Cass. I harp on him enough for the 'Brand is a DoT mage!' comment, so I won't say that again, but he got so wrapped up in his idealized hyperscaling ADC analogue that he forgot he was dealing with a champion that people like on live, not a completely new character.\n\nE) She's still clunky. It's difficult to see poison indicators in a teamfight and there's still the delay on Q, meaning if you Q-E someone fast enough you won't get the reset (which means you lost.) The positioning requirement on her ult is still really stupid in a game where Annie/Sona exist, especially combined with her delay. And making mistakes punishes her far more than most other champions, given she has to land a skillshot to get any mobility at all.\n\nI guess this post kinda got away from me, but Cass does that. If I had to summarize the changes I want to see...:\nI want her to be a poison mage; deal damage primarily through DoTs and cripple her enemies as utility. I think she should remain less mobile.\nI want that passive gone; her old passive was boring, but it would help with her mana issues and had SOME gameplay attached to it.\nGeneral clunkiness gone; her ult isn't strong enough for the unreliability it has.","replies":[{"poster":"Oerba No Naja","date":"2015-08-10T02:45:14.555+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"I guess this post kinda got away from me, but Cass does that.

He compared Cass to Anivia, because Anivia's E is pretty weak unless it's been enabled by her Q and R. However, what he failed to realise is that he got the comparison backwards. Anivia's E is comparable to Twin Fang, not Noxious Blast or Miasma. If you use Twin Fang on an enemy that isn't poisoned, just like if Anivia uses E on an enemy that isn't chilled, it's not satisfying.\n\nThe problem is that Cass's QWR are more appropriately compared to Anivia's QR. They're the setup abilities. And there's a huge difference between them in that Anivia uses her R not just to set up her E, but to spread some big AOE damage and crowd control around. Anivia uses her Q not just to set up for E, but to get clutch stuns and do powerful damage in its own right. Her Q and R are satisfying moves independently, and in using her combo. Cass is the opposite - none of her abilities feel powerful on their own, their use in enabling her Twin Fang takes up the vast majority of their power budget. Throwing out W for a slow is OK, but even someone standing in it for the full duration doesn't feel strong (I've heard stories of people standing in it spamming laugh at level 1). Using Q for poke is something you can do if you have the mana, but it's not worth it after a few levels because you need to max E and the AP ratio is gutted. R is nice if it saves your skin but there's on point throwing down any poison on the person you've stunned unless you're gonna bite them to death.\n\nIf you were to rework Anivia today and absolutely slash the damage on all of her abilities, then give her E ridiculous stuff like spell vamp, mana sustain and much higher damage, you would have a champion that was roughly equivalent to the Cassiopeia of today. *That's the problem.*\n\ntl;dr Cass needs to be more like Anivia. Anivia has 4 abilities that feel powerful, but her combo move needs to be enabled to be satisfying. That's great design and a balanced kit. Cass has 1 ability that feels powerful (E) and there isn't a single ability in her kit that feels satisfying if it's not combo'd, because the combo move (Twin Fang) is obviously worthless without being setup, but the enablers are worthless unless they're used for setup. No champion should feel like they have 3 abilities (really, 4 if you count the passive) that function only to serve one insanely overloaded ability.\n\np.s. it doesn't help that Cass's only good ability is one that doesn't have anything to do with poison - people who wanted to play a poison mage are genuinely better off playing Singed right now, what does that tell you?","replies":[{"poster":"Terchio","date":"2015-08-10T11:38:30.772+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a skeptical bystander amongst the Cass Rework talk, this actually makes sense.

So having your poison on a reliably low cooldown is awesome.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"The Queen Viper","date":"2015-08-09T23:30:57.244+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=nomoreflame naja,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=NIPGBp7c,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-08-09T22:52:43.983+0000)\n>\n> Aspect of the Serpent 100 STACKS: cassio&#039;q range increased to 900 from 850 , on kill or assit the ms bonus is refreshed .\n\nWe don't really need more Q range, since Cass never has problems hitting people who are further away from her ... the ms refresh à la Jinx could be nice though.\n\n\n\n> [{quoted}](name=nomoreflame naja,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=NIPGBp7c,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-08-09T22:52:43.983+0000)\n>\n>  Aspect of the Serpent 200 STACKS: cassio gains stakcs of twin fangs on champs and on drake/nash/blue/red for 1 twin fang hit she gains 1 stack , max 5 stacks , when u got the 5 stacks the next twin fang will deal x2 more dmg and will ignore magic resist .\n\nThis doesn't help at all and would only emphasize her Fang spamming. The \"MRes ignore\" part would be totally broken, and so would be the dmg amplification for her Twing Fang since it already is her main source of dmg anyway, or the other main source in your suggestion.\n\n\n> [{quoted}](name=nomoreflame naja,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=NIPGBp7c,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-08-09T22:52:43.983+0000)\n>\n>  Aspect of the Serpent 500 STACKS: + 100 ap . flat values because she got decent ratios now .\n\nYou are joking right? That kind of flat value would be a direct nerf to the current version and % values are usually always superior. When it comes to your concept, those ratios are too high anyway.\n\n\n> [{quoted}](name=nomoreflame naja,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=NIPGBp7c,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-08-09T22:52:43.983+0000)\n>\n>  you should get the 200 first stacks before 25 min , the 350 stacks between 30 min and 40 min and the 500 stacks in very late game\n\nWTF? Why do you want to nerf her now? You can already get full stacks with the current passive during 25 - 35 minutes anyway. And seriously, 40 min is waaaaaaaaaaay too long to unlock her max passive and majority of the games will never last that long. Not to mention, 100 flat AP is ridiculously underwhelming since you already have a full build at that point.\n\n\n\n> [{quoted}](name=nomoreflame naja,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=NIPGBp7c,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-08-09T22:52:43.983+0000)\n>\n> now you have the choice to max q or e because they are both viable . this is rly important since u can choose your early playstyle ( max e and all in vs low ranged mages or max q and poke vs ranged \" safe\" mages )\n\nSo all you did, was pretty much increase the dmg of her Q to ludicrous levels so that she would be even more broken during late game and 2-shotting people from the distance with her Q instead.","replies":[{"poster":"Oerba No Naja","date":"2015-08-10T00:05:56.018+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"remove it could be also great\"  . cassio dealt the same dmg with \" deadly cadence\" late game because   all of her kit was dealing decent damages \nshift everything into  the twin fangs and give her % ap scaling passive  with low ratio was completly retarded . \nthe increased range is not needed i agree . giving a buff to her e isnt really broken since u can nerf the reset from 0.5 to 0.75 \n\ni know that i made something totally broken with mixing her old damages ratios with a \" better syndra passive \" \nand i knew that  u cant put  ALL  these buffs options and make cassio god like tier . this rework idea cant be taken seriously since i buffed every single spell of cassio . \nbut i wanted to share my thought on possible cassio changes/balance ( some ideas can be good , some not )  to make her feel better with her poison and feel less like a machin gun , and to give her better matchups in mid .","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rot Panda","date":"2015-10-20T14:28:59.602+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How about this:\nPassive - I don't really have proper thoughts on fixing this, other than letting poison on multiple enemy champions stack independently.\nQ - Initial damage prolly a ratio around 40-50% ap, plus poison application.\nW- Its pretty solid, only thing I could think of for making it better is giving it escalating base damage for standing in the poison too long.\nE- If we want a poison mage, why not have Twin fang move to a 1-2 second cd, and extend the poison duration on the target\nR - For the love of god reduce its cast time, a couple a days ago I tried to outplay a sona with this piece of Yoricks Mana Regen, I got hit by her q and ult before the animation 'finished' and went on CD shortly before I got wrecked hard enough to make Cass regret going to Shurima.","replies":[]}]}
