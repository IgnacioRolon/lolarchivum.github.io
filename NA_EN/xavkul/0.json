Foxdrop's videos ([like this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyPxVhAC-Kg) )) have been a really big help to me. I'd say practice jungling (or any new role) in bot matches for a while until you really feel the rhythm, then take it into normal games for live practice. Don't be afraid to ask for leashes and other help along the way. \n\nI mostly jungle with Vi (because punching) but Sej is on my list once I feel comfortable in the role. Oh!

Ward the blue or red buff camp when there's 5 seconds until they spawn, then proceed killing wolves/raptors. Be mindful not to smite. When the enemy jungler does do the buff, run into the brush and get into smite range. Smite the buff when it's low (since most junglers smite krugs/gromp), then kill the disoriented jungler. Easy peasy. Mind that you should only do this is you are reasonably confident you can get either the buff or the kill. Don't bother if you can get neither buff nor kill, that sets you back too much. In the case of getting the buff, you're still set back but so is your opponent.\n(Mind that some people do this, so ward appropriately and make sure to check your jungle is secure before monsters spawn.)\n\n2) \"On the way\" and \"target\" pings right prior to a gank help alert your team to the fact that you are coming. Good team mates will set up gank conditions for you or follow up on your action. A gank is successful when you assert your team's dominance in that lane. Your primary goal is to make the enemy laner(s) back without forcing your own to back. Secondary goals are making them spend summoners, items, ward fervently or simply die. Unlike popular opinion, it's not your job to help failing lanes. If someone goes 0-5-0 before you finish your jungle item, they're not worth your time to gank usually. (This might change pending their champion.)\n\n3) **Wards**. You may be a jungler, but you are not too good to buy wards. Ward enemy jungler if you are into counter-jungling. Ward gank paths for top and mid so they stop dying to the enemy jungler. Hell, ward dragon if need be. Ward your jungle if enemy jungler is into counter-jungling. Vision is what wins games. No reason to rely on only your trinket. If you have the gold, ward.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Their Jungler","date":"2015-06-16T05:57:33.739+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sej is one of the best junglers, but you must use others as well. She gets banned a lot. Try evelynn and hecarim is also very nice (amazing ganks and tank, can carry games). Jungling is the most fun position, in my opinion. You don't have to worry about last hitting or some guy constantly harassing you in lane. You also get to feel like a commander. Your job is to clear camps, gank, countergank, keep tabs on the enemy jungler, keep tabs on the enemy laners if they roam, take out wards, coordinate so that your team can take objectives like dragon, and overall shot caller. That's a lot of things you have to do :P.\n\nI've never tried udyr or jace, so I cannot tell you about them. I know udyr can be really good early but falls of late because of his bad teamfighting.\n\nStart the camp nearest to adc lane, then go blue and then either wolves or red, depending on your health. Choose runes carefully. Gank the lanes that are getting shoved into your tower.\n\n{{champion:102}} Is very good. She has fallen off competitive play but is still used. Her ganks pre 6 are very weak and after that they are not great, but the ult helps a lot. Don't take flash with her because your ult does the same thing. I recommend exhaust but you can try tele for map mobility. Exhaust helps in ganks. She is great at counterjungling and amazing at teamfights, both at initiating or jumping right in the middle of the fight. Just your W in dragon form can burn through the enemy team if they are grouped up. Her clear speed is amazing. You can do every single camp without having to back at level 1.\n\n{{champion:113}} Is just freelo, which is why she gets banned a lot. I went 7-0 when I bought her before losing. She is a tank, so build accordingly after getting your jungle item. She has great ganks with her q. Her ult can turn around games. Land a good ult and watch everyone in your team saying ''omg I love you sej''.\n\n{{champion:28}} Can get counterjungled early, but she has good clear speed and great early game due to her passive. Also build tank with some offensive items too (very common to start with hexdrinker, but trin force is also great on her).\n\n{{champion:120}}  More common to see him top, but I think he is an amazing ganker. He has good clear speed. He is a tank, so build armor and health after finishing your jungle item and trin force (although obviously builds depend on every game). If you get lucky you can pick someone off at level 2 with your E. His ult is also amazing for ganks and teamfights. Try to first hit with e and then ult for more cc, but you can also start ganks with it. He does not have invisibility, but he can come out of nowhere with his E/Ghost/Ulti, which is pretty much the same thing.\n\nTake {{summoner:6}}  instead if {{summoner:4}}. His E and his ult are good escapes (not to mention ghost can also help escape).\n\nThe reason you take {{summoner:6}}  is because his passive makes it so that he deals extra damage proportional to your bonus movement speed, so E and ghost are great.  Additionally, your E deals more damage the more distance you have travelled before hitting your target. So if you pop ghost and e you will go really fast and travel a greater distance, thus dealing a lot of damage and probably surprising your opponents. Going E+{{summoner:6}}  and Q once you hit the opponent can secure an easy first blood at level 2.\n\nUnfortunately ,he also gets banned a fair bit, so don't rely on getting him every game. Top laners with higher peak can also take it first (and I would probably let them and choose something like an eve instead.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AyRe CoNteMpT","date":"2015-06-16T20:42:36.903+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"read my post here\n\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/tips-tricks/EvVPRxRZ-early-jungle-strat","replies":[]},{"poster":"Felixphaeton","date":"2015-06-16T14:43:36.130+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Stay flexible.  Adapt to the game, change your patterns based on enemy jungler movements, dragon timing, lane match-ups, and play off winning or even lanes.  The harder a lane is losing, the harder you should ignore them.\n\nAlso, both Quinn and Jayce are better top, and lackluster for the ADC role.  You might win lane, but you'll lack the sheer ranged DPS that a traditional ADC provides.\n\nAlso, Sona sucks mid.

Even easier when the new hud comes out since it will put ally hp above the map (one centralized location to look), you must know at all times where all enemies are and what your allies and enemy hp is. When you're jungling you should be checking each lane so you know who needs help. If you're watching yourself kill mobs past your first clear then ask \"do I know if each lane is winning/losing?\", \"do I know where the enemy jungler is right now?\"\n\nAs for your list of picks.. well..\n\nSona not mid, Jayce not an adc or jungle either and tbh even top/mid jayce is weak right now. Quiin is also typically played Top as a counterpick and isn't a great adc. I recommend picking up sivir for 450 as she is both the easiest adc to rack up farm with and the current best adc.\n\nSej is the best jg atm but banned almost every time. You have almost no chance of playing sej in ranked right now. Amumu is very similar (requires good skillshot aim though) and goes unbanned though.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Piltover Customs","date":"2015-06-16T05:29:07.086+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"From Gold to upper Platinum Sejuani is banned pretty regularly, I'm willing to say about 90% of the time. (All I've played on NA so thats what I have to go on).\n\nSome easy tips I can give you:\nGromp dies at roughly 2:02 on 90% of champions that do it.\nKnow the routes that people take (This can easily be done by spectating a bunch of games and following junglers around).\nTimings. If your mid laner has a good all-in at level 2, start a buff and go there, if it's level 3 all-in for them do gromp/golems then your buff then go there.\nIf jungler starts bottom side of the map they will usually be top-side around 3:40~ faster junglers at 3:10 and that's also about the time people ward top lane.\nTry to always smite raptors for the free oracle.\n\nAs for jungle champs:\nShyvana has been strong lately in upper platinum most build 2/3 AD items early and then tank, she's a very strong dueler early game and can be treated well as counter jungling or if you get \"slightly\" behind.\nJungle jayce takes a good bit to get going and is prone to invades.\nUdyr does it all. I'm not a great player with him so I can't give any tips there but he can go damage, hybrid damage/defensive, defensive and do well.\n\n\nAs a general rule:\nIf you get behind due to them taking your buff, it's not the end of the world. Give up a buff rather than dieing to an invade. You can always counter invade. Best to keep wards out. Lately I've been picking up sightstone on my junglers (no matter who I play almost) and get some vision in their jungle and lanes. I usually pink for my mid laner as well.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TouchpadExpert","date":"2015-06-16T03:08:53.053+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm... your champion pool is pretty bizarre. But could be worse I suppose. I recommend not starting ranked upon hitting 30 right away. One of the main reasons why is you will start a ranked game and not know what an opponent's champion does and thus have zero clue how to counter that enemy. Get some more experience under your belt. Try to get atleast 250 normal wins before starting ranked. Usually by that time you'll have a passable knowledge of the game and may have a shot at winning. You can still do ranked anyway but I would like to give you a shot at getting a win in your first placement series.\n\nSejuani is banned pretty frequently now. Udyr is a sleeper pick, I would focus learning him in the jungle role. Shyvana is a great counter jungler and is a walking wall of stats. She lacks consistent CC though so in certain team comps she doesn't fit very well (Like if you already have an Ezreal, Vladimir or Master Yi). Jayce is bizarre in the jungle. I'm sure it works, but not to the level of proficiency of your other picks.\nMid laners you have setup I recommend focusing Ahri. She's mobile, has good wave clear and strong kill/pick off potential. She's an assassin mage and is also quietly strong at the moment. I enjoy fighting Karthus whenever I have to go mid. Especially as Katarina (who gets picked a lot). He tends to suck in the laning phase but his ultimate is extremely helpful and late game his damage cannot be ignored. Karma is my favorite mid laner but they recently made some changes to her kit. Her support proficiency got better but her mid lane proficiency got nerfed. And I dislike Sona as a mid laner. She's got her burst and decent utility in her kit but when you compare her to other utility mages (Orianna especially) she falls short. But the good news is that none of your mid laners should see bans.\n\nSupporting I assume is a role you don't enjoy playing as much since you just repeat Karma and Sona here. Both Sona and Karma are poke/sustain style supports. If you get matched with a Draven ADC he won't get as much use out of his passive as when you select a kill lane support. I recommend picking up one of the following: Blitzcrank, Thresh, Leona or Annie.\n\nADC you list Jayce. You don't see Jayce ADC so much because for an ADC his range sucks. You could use his Hammer gun's Q but that makes you go oom and its also very easy to dodge without the speed gate's amplification. Quinn also has short range. She actually functions quite well top lane. But as far as ADCs go she's very bottom tier down with Twitch. So Quinn won't be banned at all. For ADCs consider learning something with more range: Caitlyn, Corki, Ezreal, Kog'maw, Tristana and Ashe. Ashe may see some bans right now and with the improvements to Caitlyn she may see some bans also. Kog'maw is the sleeper pick for ADC.\n\nLastly is top lane. You list Jayce a lot. This is probably his best role according to the meta. I find him to be incredibly versatile so he's a good pick if you're good with him. Garen is easy enough to pick up. He just falls short compared to lots of other popular top laners. He has his silence for CC and that's it. But if you like Garen you may find Darius easy to pick up too. Half of Darius' kit resembles Garen's kit. But Darius too isn't too strong in the current meta. Right now the most oppressive top laner is Ryze. You spam spells and you win. So if you want to counter that you could go with Galio top or you can join the party and play Ryze yourself. He's only 450 IP so thats only 2 days worth of FWotD points for a strong champ. If you want a sleeper pick take a look at Shen. They finally gave him scaling MR so he has improved since then. Shen is extremely versatile as any stat (except mana) works on him. I like him.\n\nJust my thoughts. Feel free to pick and choose what info you find useful. I know you won't agree with everything I mentioned.","replies":[]},{"poster":"J3R3MYism","date":"2015-06-16T03:05:01.383+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hey friend!\nSo because you are not a high elo i wouldnt say to main anything letalone any champ.\nDont get me wrong, im not saying not to have a favorite posistion, DO THAT!\nAnywho, so sej is banned quite often due to her being rather popular in the pro scene, and for her simple to use skills.\nSo when you play in the jungle, tanks are the \"op\" champs. Sej, Udyr and Shyvana are in that group. Jayce could be good but i dont think so, because he lacks an easy to use crowd control ability. \nOK so my tips to you are thinking about your ganks, MAKE THEM HAPPEN! Even if you are playing udyr, who is typically a farm heavy jungler, gank.\nBuy wards. This should make more and more sense as you play more games. If you are warding your jungle, you can see if people are in there or anything of the sort.\n Also ward for you lanes! As the jungler you kind of feel like everyones bitch... kinda sucks I know. But if you are helping all of the lanes by doing something so simple as warding for them, that is going to help them play safer and smarter.\nKnow your teams power spikes. Gank your lanes when your laners are strong, helping them get even more ahead when they are strong..\n\nOK so for adc you should learn to play cait. she is probly one of the best laning ad carries.and learn to farm effeicently.\n\n\nI hope that i helped!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dank Hangler","date":"2015-06-16T21:20:24.650+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Gank Sh*t, Don't Feed.
