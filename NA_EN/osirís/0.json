I've seen a few other posts about latency increases, and I'm curious what ISP you're using.\n\nWe can take a look at your route to the server and see if there are issues before your connection hits the League servers. We can do this if you run a traceroute log using [WinMTR.](http://winmtr.net/) After opening the application, plug in the IP address 104.160.131.1 and run the trace for 5 minutes before exporting your results as a text. You can paste the results here so I can take a look.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[{"poster":"p00nSL4Y3r69420","date":"2016-08-31T00:27:37.525+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-31T16:53:56.024+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your route looks particularly troubling. Your connection to your own network is great, but on the first hop outside your network, your latency hits 82ms of latency, then spikes up to 3135ms  on the Level 3 node at 5-2-20.bear2.Phoenix1.Level3.net\n\nSince the issues are along Suddenlink and Level3's networks, you'll want to reach out and work with Suddenlink's Tier 2 support to start an investigation. Providing them this screenshot will give them additional context on the issue and provide them with specific nodes to look at.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or concerns with this.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DunkinNoobs","date":"2016-08-31T01:30:36.096+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dewey, AZ here.
