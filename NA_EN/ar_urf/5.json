I'm just not sure how yet. Maybe change it from 4% of your max health on melee auto attacks to 4% of your max health plus 1 for every stack? So if you procced it 50 times.

The most procs I've ever got in a game were in the 60 range on {{champion:51}}. So if the changes happened, that's like 40 magic damage after a 15 minute lane. You'd still be better off going conqueror or yellow tree runes unless you were an assassin.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-06-08T04:42:15.494+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> mame graap\n\nhttps://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/026/913/excuse.jpg\n\nBut yes, it is a completely shit keystone that, even when it is actually useful, has no obvious feedback to show you it is being useful.","replies":[{"poster":"AR URF","date":"2019-06-08T04:44:22.207+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MagicFlyingLlama,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=vZwNEe2H,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2019-06-08T04:42:15.494+0000)\n>\n> https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/026/913/excuse.jpg\n> \n> But yes, it is a completely shit keystone that, even when it is actually useful, has no obvious feedback to show you it is being useful.\n\nSorry I was typing on phone.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CrazyMonkeyCZ","date":"2019-06-08T04:50:09.621+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fiora likes you.","replies":[]}]}
