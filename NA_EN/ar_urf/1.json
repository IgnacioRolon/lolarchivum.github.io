Here, it indicates the desired _intonation_ of the text, not necessarily that the text forms a question. You can do something similar by ending a question with a period: \"Did you even read what I posted.\" That sentence is phrased as a question, but the period indicates the intonation of a statement, suggesting that the sentence's author knows that their audience didn't read their post. It can be an effective literary mechanism if used sparingly.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ZackTheWaffleMan","date":"2018-07-07T02:39:19.594+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"what.

There's too much damage overall, but on top of that there's also just too much damage that ignores defenses. I used to support target-agnostic damage as a means of equalizing damage against squishies and tanky targets, but failed to realize in the process that tanks and fighters are tanky _for a reason_, and that being able to just ignore one of their major strengths means they end up getting devalued, with little they can do against it. It creates this major balancing issue where tanky champions end up needing to be balanced around a vast portion of their defenses getting ignored completely, which then screws over whichever champions weren't updated to the newest true/max health damage craze. At this point, it might be better to not only turn back on this anti-tank damage inflation, but go even further and remove _all_ true and max health damage from the game, with appropriate balancing given to tanky champions in the process.","replies":[{"poster":"Alex h8721","date":"2018-07-07T07:54:57.690+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"nah, max health magic/physical damage definitely have a place and can still be mitigated by armor","replies":[{"poster":"Teridax68","date":"2018-07-07T07:57:20.699+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They can be mitigated by armor, but not by health, so you're still just devaluing one stat instead of another.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Colton147","date":"2018-07-06T21:50:09.009+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Getting dealt 4.8K damage on {{champion:23}}'s Super Mega Death Rocket.\nhttps://imgur.com/yGkSs4p","replies":[{"poster":"koshkyra","date":"2018-07-07T01:15:04.286+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love how one of the sources doesnt even have a name.
