Try to bait out his windwall as well before you blast your spells.\n\nYasuos farming and harass is the same ability. Most mages main damage abilities are \"minion blockable skill shots\"; By the time you clear and position to harass the yasuo his flow shield or his windwall is back up. There is no \"bait it\" when the margin for error is so large. Its like saying \"bait vaynes tumble\".\n\n> And stop saying his op if you get outplayed. It just means that he was the better player.\n\nHah. \nHaha.\nHe is over powered and frustrating. His flow shield is powerful enough as a passive, his wind wall deserves to be an ultimate ability (A defensive ultimate with a 60/40/20 cooldown. Makes sense right? Then we can tone down the power of his 2 second knockup with instant damage and %A-pen), and he is extremely mobile within YOUR wave.  \n\nThere is very little \"outplayed\" and \"better player\" - yasuos numbers and defenses are just to high for any kill to be a fair outplay. Especially once he gets his IE/zeal.\nIn fact, my last malzahar game, i had a yasuo call ME over powered because i could EQWRQ to outplay him when all he had to do is Q3 R. I silenced him  twice, Ed, Wd, then ulted. I stopped his ult both times and killed him in my own minion wave. Thats a real outplay. Not HAS A KEY?!

It's just me as a person. For example. When someone calls me trash in-game because they were able to win against me using veigar,amumu, or annie when I was playing vayne. I'm not just going to ignore it or mute them. First I will say something like. \"What are trying to prove? you're playing annie\" Most of the time they'll say something like \"mad\" or \"salty af\" or \"says the vayne player\" I one time had an enemy veigar that said \"trash vayne player\" so I responded with \"you're playing veigar, it's not hard to get fed with him\" he said \"all you do is right click\" I told him \"ok how about you try vayne out for yourself\" he said \"I don't own vayne silly\" so I told him \"if you don't own vayne, than don't say all you do is right click\"\n\nSo how is all of this relevant? Like I said, if someone is going to hate s champion that I don't think deserves hate, I'll question it. And my thoughts are more along the lines of \"just because you can't play him or got outplayed by him doesn't make him overpowered\" \n\nMost of the time people all choose the same answers as everyone else, which tells me there is some bias. No doubt people are going to hate his passive or his windwall and I agree that they are annoying, but it's not hard to play against and yasuo is countered by many champs such as lux,Jax,malzahar.\n\nI still feel there are plenty of champs more annoying than yasuo that get hate, but not as much, such as Riven,Teemo,Illaoi (who is way more annoying than yasuo imo), and fizz.\n\nMy personal ones being the ones listed as well as Draven,malzahar,brand,kennen and much more for various reasons such as\n\nFizz: annoying ult that does a lot of damage. He can E any ult, not just projectiles(yasuo's windwall) his e starts at like 13 second CD vs yasuo's 20 second windwall CD.\nDraven: I can't say too much, because I don't play him, he just has ridiculous damage.\nVeigar: very easy to use aoe stun, and when you do get stunned you can't do much but hope he doesn't have his ult up unless you're running qss. Just recently updated banshee veil, which makes him easier to burst, but still annoying because of the 40 second CD. He can be built tank so can't be killed easily by virtually any midlaner at mid and especially late game.\nYi: If you're a champion with only a slow for some mild cc, than you might as well prostrate yourself in lane or in jungle when he ults you. His q can avoid ults, has a low CD, and can displace, so if you flash over a wall at the wrong moment it's over. He has true dmg, so tank yi is a thing.\nOlaf: ult, can't be cc'd and constantly pokes with his axes.\nRiven: because of her Shields and her ult is almost unavoidable unless you flash behind her, which is very difficult.\n\nYou might be thinking \"but you're hating too, so that makes you a hypocrite\" Well the way I see it is I'm not down on threads just because of a title or because it doesn't fit my viewpoints. I'm not jumping on any bandwagons because it's trending, that's just not me. I just hate when players assume that I'm mad,salty, or butthurt because I'm trying to point out flaws or give reasons as to why they won a lane. You won't see me saying \"you're playing leblanc, so don't shit talk\" but you might see me saying something like that to Anne,veigar,malzahar,Teemo and really any lowskill champion. And I'll admit when I've been outplayed. This one game I was Warwick top and went like 4/2/? And the enemy fiora was like 0/4/1. She was better than me at farming and received more ganks. The reason she lost is because her greed. She kept tower diving me, so like any competent Warwick would do is press enter and attack, so that's what I did.\n\nThis took forever to type out on my phone lol, so you should know how firm I am in my beliefs.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DoktorKaiser","date":"2017-06-02T22:24:31.453+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah 99% of people are retards, only you are smart.

Auto attack him to drop his shield, than blast your spells on him. Don't overextend and sit on top of his minions. Try to bait out his windwall as well before you blast your spells.\n\nCan you give a good example scenario of all of that working? Because while all of those sound good individually the combination of them sounds rather difficult. \n\nFor example, how do I get close enough to him to land the auto attack (and break the shield) without being over extended? In most of the scenarios I've seen, if I'm close enough to auto him he's likely able to close the gap with E (if not to me directly then to one minion first), putting me in the danger range. He's closing that gap with Wind Wall still available, and somewhere in this I'm suppose to try bait out Wind Wall. From personal experience, there are very few times when Yasuo will Wind Wall a mage's auto attacks. So I've got to fire a spell dangerous enough that he'll Wind Wall it before backing off and proceeding to poke him in this narrow window, but about the only spell that fits the bill is my only CC ability. With that spell destroyed, he'll just keep attacking me, potentially ulting me under tower while he's outside of tower range. \n\n--------\n\nYasuo is one of those \"easier said than done\" champions to play against. I typically play Xerath, so I can mostly ignore Wind Wall. That makes it *significantly* less frustrating to play against him (thus I ban Kat), but not everyone is so lucky. Some good examples of how to trade in a scenario where both parties are full health and have everything off cooldown would be more helpful for getting people off the \"Ban Yasuo\" train.\n\nPersonally, I think if they made it so Wind Wall didn't spawn covering all of Yasuo's hit box (leaving his back exposed) it would go a long way to reducing frustrations and reducing his ban rate.","replies":[{"poster":"AR URF","date":"2017-06-02T22:24:41.497+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=DrCyanide,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=W6OXZEIs,comment-id=000a,timestamp=2017-06-02T22:05:34.341+0000)\n>\n> Can you give a good example scenario of all of that working?

Lux auto attack, than q, than e and r. Leblanc auto attack, than skill spam. Akali passive play until you reach level 6, than shroud and skill spam. Shroud if yasuo q is charged. \n\nThere's a few examples. Yasuo's windwall is like a 15-20 second CD. You just need to get creative while playing against him and know when to jump on him. \n\nWhen I played yasuo I found malzahar,lux,Jax, Riven, Darius, and akali to be a pain in the butt to fight as well as xerath.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Holy Fervor","date":"2017-06-02T23:37:08.513+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yasuo is rather straightforward to get good at. He has a very direct kit, and a lot of power. I remember before the first set of nerfs it would be brutal stopping one top without the jungler sitting there.
