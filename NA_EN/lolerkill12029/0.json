My name is Tristan and I have been playing league since season 2, maybe a little bit longer. Thing is right, I got perma banned the 5th of january 2018. Ive been crying for the past 40 minutes.. I know, it sounds like im trying to win you over. But i know the thing i did was wrong, I flamed and i was just mean to people that don't deserve it. Thing is, Ive been playing on the same account since season 2. And i've put in equally as much money as i have playing hours. If you ever read this riot, I am deeply sorry for what i've done. Please unban me just this one time, I can prove that i'm better then what I was. I will never flame again,  give me this one chance to correct myself. Please. You can even Perma mute me in chat after if i get unbanned. I just really want my account back... Please riot. Please. \r\n\r\nSincerly : Tristan.","replies":[{"poster":"Son of Ornn","date":"2018-01-05T04:54:59.309+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sad to say Tristan, I'm not sure if your account will be unbanned; checking your history it seems this is not the first time you've been flagged for negativity in game, and that repeat offense is what led to this permanent ban. As much as I respect your hard work and endeavors in LoL, no amount of time played or money can make Behavior Support or other players oversee the negativity that was displayed. <:T\n\nThat said, you can still reach out to our Behavior Support to discuss the situation with them if you haven't yet by [**writing a ticket**](http://zitck). Doing so will let you make an appeal as well as potentially give you more context should you request it. I definitely suggest reaching out to them instead.","replies":[]},{"poster":"lolerkill12029","date":"2018-02-13T17:07:05.036+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I also have another question, if i am about to get permanently banned, why do riot make the bots do it? If there is a reason for some one to be banned. And as they said it's like a 0.00001% chance of people getting permanently banned they should have time to put a real person to look into it and give feedback. And i also feel like you should get a refund for all the money you spend on that game, It's not like im hacking. If i was hacking, go for it. Take my money and everything i have on there, but i was trolling and i was telling someone off cause they banned my champion before the game started just by assuming i was \"bad\"... That sounds really stupid to me. So stuff they need to implement : A normal person if you're about to get perma banned, People shouldnt be allowed to ban a champion that someone in your team has already picked, And a refund.","replies":[]},{"poster":"lolerkill12029","date":"2018-01-05T15:06:24.896+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i understand fully with what both you have said. I flamed a rengar on my team yeastureday that led to my permanent ban. And how that happend was that i picked yasuo in game, he clearly saw that i picked him aswell yet he still banned him. I got very angry and asked him why, and he just said \"Yasuo is a unfair champ lol\" and i thought that was the most stupid answer ever. Yes i got banned, Yes im prob never gonna get my account back, But they HAVE to make a system ingame that makes so you can not ban the champion someone has picked on your team.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kokua","date":"2018-01-05T03:12:31.579+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately with behavior related bans, it's hard to dispute your case. How long you've played and how much money you've spent does not protect you from the punishment system. In most cases, you receive warnings, minor punishments, harsher punishments, and permanent punishments, and you're repeatedly told what will happen if your behavior continues on this negative path. In more extreme circumstances with extremely negative behavior, you might find your way towards the harsher and permanent punishments sooner than others.","replies":[]}]}
