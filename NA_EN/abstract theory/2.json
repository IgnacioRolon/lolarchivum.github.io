He ended in 0-13. People like this seem to provoke negative responses from their teammates. Congratz, You dont have any LP so the loss doesnt matter, but you just burned about 80LP combined from everybody else. If you are one of these people please.. change your ways and dont be a jackass. If you dont care, Dont play ranked. Simple as that.","replies":[{"poster":"InsaneSamurai","date":"2015-07-31T21:15:54.958+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, the community is probably always going to suck because Riot won't seriously invest in changing it.\n\nWeird part is this doesn't even make sense for the 0 lp guy.  You can lose a rank from your first 0 lp loss.","replies":[]}]}
