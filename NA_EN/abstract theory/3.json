The game isn't lost. Your laners surely have a reason why they didn't/couldn't help (being pushed to their turrets, which is also the reason why enemy jungler decided to invade). So just get your shit together and learn to play from a position where you're behind.\n\nOn the other hand, if it's 22/3 and you just lost your third inhibitor while you didn't even take out a single turret of them and no dragons, the game is beyond lost and if you stop trying at this point, I wouldn't blame you.\n\nIn ranked, I never left a game or stopped trying (before someone else already afked and the game was obviously lost) even when I am 0/6 because I generally play lategame champions and I know that comebacks do happen.
