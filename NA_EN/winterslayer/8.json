With Shapeshifter she is slightly better, but she needs to be replaced ASAP. Shyvana/Gnar/Swain/ as 1* are better than a 2 star Elise without both her buffs. \n\n{{champion:76}} Needs another wild, with it she is the best T1 unit in the game, but since you do not have a wild her atksp makes her nearly useless. The heal is still great if she can get it off, but not good enough. A Gnar would've gotten you far. \n\n{{champion:164}} is not good without a front line  Your only fonrtline is Jayve and GP, but by the time she ults the first time they are bleeding or dead.\nThat's a problem because that means your front line has a combined ~2.5 HP with 3 champions some  front liners have almost that alone with 2*. \n\n{{champion:236}} is a solid unit just to hold onto, gunslingers in general are bad, noble is amazing though and having 2 gunslingers isn't a problem. \n\n{{champion:126}} is solid, but you probably needed to replace Cami with Vi or Jinx and get more front line instead of the other 2 shape shifters and keep Jayce amazing ult. Jinx is the only good gunslinger (MF Sucks) so keeping Jayce luc and Jinx would've been fine. IMO\n\n{{champion:41}} is unreliable compared to other 3 cost, Shen would've been a much better blade master or AAtrox to Sync with Elise and shoot up her value. dropping the gunslinger buff wouldn't be missed. \n\n{{champion:28}} if you don't have 3 assassins don't bother with Eve the new tank eve is pretty solid, but you still need 2 more for the damage. This would've been a great unit to replace for protecting your Draven. \n{{champion:119}} Dar or Kat was needed for a chance at imperial, while not as reliable as getting 4 it can still win you a lot of rounds just having the buff on Draven. Having Dar over a lot of what you had would've given your front line to protect Draven and nice damage.\n\n\nAt the start your frontline GP/Jayce/Cami will get cut through fast, and your nid or elise probably wont even transform. Eve will abadon draven leaving you with an open draven for ashe arrows or anyone that's close.\n\n1st had a Kennen which probably killed your team everytime solo. \n2nd had an Asol which probably did the same or had Ahris help. \n3rd had leo and Ashe to lock down Draven and Braum to tank for days while Liss can absorb Eve. (Of course thats all speculation.)\n\nExtra note, everyone had more powerful synergies than you. Yordle (gold) Shapshifter\nSorc (gold)\nGlacial Guardian (gold)\n4th just had a lot of units and beef, but his Kha was a 3* and I'm assuming loaded with items. Your comp has no clear win condition like theirs did. \n\nThat can be due to rolling or luck or not picking champions that were available I can't tell though.\n\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ztoka","date":"2019-09-04T15:43:49.526+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Comp is nothing w/o items to go w/ it.
