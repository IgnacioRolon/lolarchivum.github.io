One Elise spider and one Big Shyvana. I have 3 champs left in the game.\r\n\r\nWhy is it possible, that every damn time, I lose because all my  champions attack Elise Spider instead of Big Shyvana!? Shyvana literally drains their health, but my champs decide to ignore her and hit the spider like a braindead r%%%%% so they die. While maybe when they would attack SHYVANA first they would not die.\r\n\r\nThis happens a lot. Not just with these champs. Oh, 2 star Jinx with 3 items shoots us completely to the graveyard, well lets all together focus 500000 HP Braum instead.","replies":[{"poster":"Porglit","date":"2019-08-30T19:24:27.797+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Champs attack whoever's closest.
