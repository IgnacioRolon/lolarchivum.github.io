There should be NO unwinnable games if you're playing against people that are genuinely at your own skill level... But it feels like Riot picks two players at random per match and gives one side good players and the other side bad players,  it feels like when I go 13 and 1 I am the \"good player\" carrying baddies, stomping people who aren't as good as me.  When I'm 5/4/8 with a teammate who is 16/2/11 it feels like I was matched with him so he'd get his win,  similarly, when I'm 1/0/2 and the rest of my team is 1/5/0, 2/9/2 etc; it feels like I was destined to lose that game, just because Riot wanted to feed LP to someone on the other team.","replies":[{"poster":"Nea104","date":"2019-07-13T00:54:50.943+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=XenaPhobiaFTW,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=QEXTNUVk,comment-id=00040000,timestamp=2019-07-13T00:44:04.634+0000)\n>\n> I've realized it, most games I play are either kinda close and clutch wins, or we lose by 5 minutes because the score is 2 to 12.

If you had ten people of equal skill and dumped them into an in-progress match like this one, then yes, the losing team might manage to hang on even through this massive level/item discrepancy and eventually level the playing field enough for it to be a toss-up.\n\nHowever, one team usually falls behind the other not by accident, but due to factors like skill, tilt, etc. which won't just disappear once the losing team gets items. Snowballing just makes things worse, tilts people, etc. Not many matches pit an early-game team against a tilt-proof late-game team of equal skill.","replies":[]},{"poster":"General Esdeath ","date":"2019-07-13T17:18:08.579+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=rujitra,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=QEXTNUVk,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2019-07-12T19:40:43.345+0000)\n>\n> My team wanted to surrender at 15 and 20 minutes.
