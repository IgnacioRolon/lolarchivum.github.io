I'm guessing you spent it on levels, but didn't get a T4 unit?\n\nI find the last part improbable, as you are level 8. So this is telling me more about how you don't know how to transition into late game and take advantage of your numbers.\n\nYou  can get Cho, ASol, Blitz, Gnar, Kennen. \n\nOnce you have Asol and Blitz2, you can switch out the Ahri &amp; WW (as blitz scales well with sorcerers). Now your trist can become a gnar or a kennen, which provides much better CC and damage than a single trist. \n\nOf course, still switch out the Khasix with Cho. \n\nIf you just bulldozed through lvl7 and 8 without utilizing the rolls during those levels, that might be where the downfall is, as the decision to power level was probably not for the best. \n","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-08-23T12:15:31.238+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Zazz.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecns_W9q_s0","replies":[]}]}
