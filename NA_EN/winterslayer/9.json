Plus he still can benefit from aura items since they reach 2 tiles. And stacking HP items on him is way better than raw damage because of his passive. This isn't league it's TFT, TFT yasuo has no crit effects. He's a bruiser here.

He doesn't need buffs at all because on hit items for him are just as broken as gunslingers.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sirsir","date":"2019-09-01T17:11:49.151+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:157}} really needs level 2 to be useful. Exile scales with stats. I think one problem I see is no one builds health on him. That's how his passive scales, {{item:3748}} to the rescue. \n\n{{champion:34}} is next, without AP items she does no damage, she doesn't go well with the Glacial typing. Her savior is {{champion:127}} matching her typing meaning you only need these 2 and another elementalist to reach her full potential. Of course then you get rekt by dragons...\n\n{{champion:21}} ults an almost dead target on the side? Congratulations she stunned herself. She also shows up too late for Pirate to be particularly useful, even tho paired with {{champion:41}} and {{champion:104}} she gets a lot of synergy going.\n\n{{champion:80}} will live and die by the strength of his types. If guardian is weak he will be too. Plus he's lacking a lot of cross-synergy with his other units. Still, with {{item:3075}} {{item:3083}} and Dragon up, combined with the fact that (someone tell me if I'm wrong) he still gets Warmogs regen in the air would make him nearly unkillable. \n\n{{champion:10}} ult is just silly good, even if the champ suffers a bit of an identity crisis. Great synergy with {{champion:86}} + Noble. \n\n{{champion:50}} I haven't had a lot of experience with but I could see him becoming a true monster if built around. Gunblade + Transform health + Imperial buff = won round. And he's even got demon synergy, which is super strong in general, AND and he shares it with Elise. A simple core of Elise+Darius+Swain and either Shyv+ASol or Jayce+Hextech is a very scary setup. \n\n{{champion:30}} at level 2 with a deathcap and Sorcerer 1 literally oneshot the enemy backline in the 1v1 fest in a recent game I had. Plus I've been LOVING Phantoms lately. The only downside is his ult has a tendency to get interrupted if he doesn't get a Seraphs and Sorcerer buff...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porglit","date":"2019-08-31T12:57:26.862+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've had an exceptionally bad time getting {{champion:34}} to do much of anything.
