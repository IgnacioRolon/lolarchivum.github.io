He frustrates mages mid, especially immobile mages because of his \"unique gaem dsogen mobility\"\r\n\r\nThe whole frilly set of movements gives off the flashy LC$bigplays illusion of \"high skill cap\" character. But in reality it takes zero skill to do so. Wind wall is instant and can be instantly panic mashed to \"clutch mlg big plays\" cockblock skillshot based abilities that take a disproportionate amount of skill to properly land and aim vs the amount of skill it takes for yasuo to \"counterplay\" it with his windwall. \r\n\r\nThis entire concept of being a little bitch and wasting enemy abilities missing you on your high movement low cool down dashes is reminiscent of old Phantom Lancer in dota. Phantom Lancer's unque trait was that he would make illusions of himself that would fool enemies into wasting entire ults onto him, thinking that it would be him. His actual right click carry damage was kind of below average, though it did mana burn. In this way he would carry by making the enemy waste resources. Normally I think this is good game design, a conceptually creative way of carrying but that is a game with BKB, forcestaff, and tons of immunity abilities and items to shit on carries.\r\n\r\nYasuo is a nonstop mobile character in a fighting game where mobility defines everything. \r\n\r\nThough I will admit Asymmetrical lane matchups shouldn't especially be a basis on actual balance changes, as well as going yasuo mid always means an AP jungle or top, otherwise your team comp has no magic damage and the enemy team stacks armor and facerolls you. Thus we can conclude that the majority of GD whining about Yasuo is from solo Q where there is zero coordination. \r\n\r\nThe reason why mages mid complain about Yasuo and not Zed and Talon? Zed and Talon run on resources and don't get free defenses. Their mobility is also on a much higher cooldown and actually costs a certain amount of resources, in which zed's case, makes it easy to telegraph when they will use it. \r\n\r\nYasuo takes too little skill to \"mlgoutplay\" most mid lane matchups\r\n\r\n\"I move and get free defenses\" isn't gameplay Riot, not when there is a giant area for him to walk around in lane, and unlike in dota where mid lane has highground and harder fog mechanics that make lane harassment an actual timed decision.","replies":[{"poster":"Helltoken","date":"2015-12-03T02:24:15.958+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":49,"body":"Here is how you beat him:\n1) don't fight him in minions... that's just giving him what he wants.\n2) have CC, or use midlaners that make his windwall useless.

In the height of his popularity, zed was complained about to the point where he was nerfed even though he was not dominating the game on a frequent basis. \n\nWith shiv's nerf and warlord's nerf, yasuo is COMPLETELY fine. People will downvote me for that single sentence, but it still doesnt change it's truth. He went down 20 places this patch to a meager 27th place, and his winrate is at 46%. The only thing differentiating 5.23 Yasuo and 5.21 Yasuo is the 100% crit he gets, which makes him _stronger_ not _op_","replies":[{"poster":"Knoyle","date":"2015-12-03T16:00:19.618+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not going to tell you that you are wrong in what you said.  However, I would like to point out that Warlord's \"nerf\" is about as effective as using gum to fix a leak. I have had a match where I killed Yasuo three times with not too much worry as he was reckless and rushing to kill me. However with no kills and pure CS alone he was able to reach 100% crit anyway making him nearly late game dangerous relatively due to his ability to now be able and go assassinate champs with an innate healing from just hitting them. \n\nI may be wrong that Yasuo doesn't take much skill, though from what I have seen it matters little after early game, but If a champion can get to their \"bread and butter\" status with just two items after just hitting level 7, I'm going to call this \"easy mode\".   Now If yasuo was just a \"hypercarry\" type champ with a kit similar to someone like Xin or Riven, It would be not that big of a deal. My main problem lies with the Wall. With most Fighters and/or Assassins counterplay to ranged seems to involve quickly closing distance and being able to punish ranged who are in majority very squish champs. \n\nYasuo's wall however allows him to ignore this need entirely. While One would usually get punished for being too reckless in a fight, He can summon this to negate any consequence that a ranged champ would provide while also still having his dash to fall back on for fleeing in a hurry and the free shield makes it even more of a chore if and when you actually do catch him. Also a 2 game learning curve?
