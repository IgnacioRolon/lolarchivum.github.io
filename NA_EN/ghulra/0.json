It sounds like whistling wind, occasional bird calls and other such ambience. To my knowledge, there is absolutely no way to make this horrible noise stop fucking whistling on my computer all day long  without ALSO disabling all client SFX and deafening myself to every invite, message and queue accept. I submitted a ticket, the response told me basically &quot;you can mute everything&quot; which I already knew, and to post any feedback to the boards for some reason. SO feedback; whistling noise is annoying as hell, muting my client is inconvenient as fuck.","replies":[{"poster":"Vonderhamz","date":"2017-11-20T18:54:55.434+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Ghulra - This is coming from the runes panel. It's a known issue that is getting a fix! For now, just go back to your Runes panel, click on any one of your rune pages, then leave. The sound will stop. When you save after leaving the panel is when the ambient sound comes back. Sorry about that, it'll be cleared up next patch!","replies":[]}]}
