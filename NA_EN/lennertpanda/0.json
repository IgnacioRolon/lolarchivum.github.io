But now I get a message that pops up every time again when I start up my client saying: \"We have restored this installation to an older version of League of Legends. Now we'll try to patch you up to the latest version.\" but it doesn't patch. So I click on OK and I get a next pop-up that tells me this: \"There was a problem patching League of Legends. We'll restore a backup version and try updating after you restart the patcher.\" So I restart the patcher and this whole thing starts again. I have tried to look on the forum for a solution but they didn't work, re√Ønstalling my game also didn't work. I just want to play league but I can't because of this stupid bugg. So I ask for a solution.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading and thinking of a solution with me :D\r\n\r\nLennertPanda","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-21T16:00:34.307+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd be pretty frustrating constantly getting that error, even after a reinstall.  This could be happening for a few reasons, the most prominent being a possible security setting that's blocking your game files from being accessed or updated properly.  Start off with our [permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) guide to make sure that League is being added as an exception without security blocks.  Let me know if if progress is made!","replies":[{"poster":"LennertPanda","date":"2017-04-21T16:27:16.450+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First I will thank you for replying to my post :D\nSecond I need to say that I have followed the steps of the permissions guide (except for the reinstalling because I already did that) but that I still get the error. I don't know what is causing the error but I'm even thinking of resetting my whole PC to get this fixed, do you think that's a good idea or do you have another solution?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-21T16:38:54.083+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Happy to help!  I don't think an OS reset would do a whole lot other than take up more of your time, and there could be other factors involved.
