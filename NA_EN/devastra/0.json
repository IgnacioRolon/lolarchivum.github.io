But it also means she can't cast any spells or farm easily.\n\nDunno why this has so many downvotes (nor where the Annie hate has come from?) but it's true. For an Annie player being forced to hold stun is the most frustrating feeling and really wastes time. At the end of the day no mage wants to spend forever not casting anything because it's necessary for waveclear and poke, but Annie can't do either of those things while her stun is up without risking being all-inned right after or ganked.\n\nFrustrate her when she has the stun and make it difficult to all-in. When she inevitably burns a W for waveclear or decides she can't just not harass you for any longer then you take advantage of the fact that she used her stun and didn't do something significant with it. Her passive is very good in terms of making her a \"moments of strength and weakness\" champion and her short range means you can make her moment of strength worthless if you're smart.\n\nNote that this is only about Annie mid. Annie support can and will hold her stun all day long if she wants to because she has no need to touch the wave.","replies":[{"poster":"Seth Lightheart","date":"2015-03-20T01:36:28.008+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"This....

She is fair there. If she has passive up, then you keep out of her range. If she wants to keep it, she will be forced to not use abilities. If she uses it on minions, then you can easily take advantage and harass/poke/all-in her. She is also easily susceptible to ganks. The thing that has the least amount of counterplay is her Flash + Tibbers. This combo can be ruined by good reaction, mercurial, peel, banshee's veil, or spellshields.\n\nYes, she is strong. Though she is meant to be. She is a burst mage. However, once all of her abilities are used, she switches to a \"kite around the battlefield until cooldowns are over\" strategy.\n\nThe problem mainly lies with the fact that she is a popular support. She is permitted to access her stun at level 1. She has no reason to use it, since she will not be farming minions. Her auto range is very strong at bot lane as well, but that only adds on to her ability to zone and initiate. Then later on in the game, she might be able to solo the enemy ADC, or just an enemy squishy in general. However, this would go for any AP Mid that goes bot. Generally, at bot lane, she is way too controlling with her power and utility.\n\nI am sure that Riot is looking into her, as she has grown popular and powerful, particularly in the support role once again. Before, they nerfed her early game stun time. It is likely they will not do that again, but they have to try to change her so that her support role is weaker but her mid role is about the same, because her mid-lane power is fine.

Riot need to remove the new thing they did with her Q where half of the cooldown is reduced upon last hitting something, it gives her way too much power in lane with regards to maintaining her stun, and I have no problem admitting that.\n\nYou could punish her for using her stun up previously, but now she just Q's up a shit storm and has it back up within seconds, all for no mana, but the mana refund is necessary and hardly the reason she might feel overbearing now.\n\nWith all that said though, if you try to deny that Banshee's veil fucks her up you're delusional. A flash dependent champion with mediocre spell range at best, is not going to be able to blow up an ADC if they play properly and have Banshee's. Flash Tibbers has a deceptively long range once you master the boundaries of the Tibbers impact, but her Q and W are middling range wise and if you Banshee's the initial Tibbers burst, and the stun, you as the ADC WILL NOT get hit by the QW follow up. If you do you were too far out of position and the fault is in your court. \n\n**Tl;dr**: Annie main admits that riot giving her half Q cooldown on kill was absolutely retarded and unnecessary. Everything else is fine. Build Banshee's on your ADC and position appropriately and she's fine. She only looks freelo when you don't account for her flash.

If you're playing an assassin then all-in on Annie is scary to say the least but so is it on Lissandra or Malzahar, they're all considered anti-assassins for a reason. All-ins from mages however work very well on Annie. I mean even Cassiopeia can go ham with Twin Fang (generally considered to be similar to Annie in \"countered by the fact that almost everyone reaches a lot further but amazing when in range\") without ever getting in Annie's zone of influence. Annie has no response to a standard mage all-in because short of Flash most people can delete her before she ever gets in range to do the same. What's the problem with all-in being counterplay?\n\nOn that note I don't get why you have to go ham on her anyway. Annie versus a standard mage is like melee versus ranged top. You win lane by poking down the person who can't reach you, not by trying to kill them at every opportunity.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Robert Smith","date":"2015-03-20T03:12:52.434+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The counter is living through her combo and hoping she is in range for you to fight back","replies":[]},{"poster":"N3mO06","date":"2015-03-20T00:59:08.786+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"The problem with her is that she can zone you forever because that passive has no cd and if you try to do something, she just flash full combo  for something like 1 k base damage plus a stun of  1,5 sec. And you can do nothing. Same problem in tf with her instant aoe stun and great damage. i'm not saying she is unbeatable, but she isn't an healthy champ with her point click stun and massive damage, something like the same problem with the pre-nerf stun of Veigar, an instant aoe stun on a massive burst mage","replies":[]}]}
