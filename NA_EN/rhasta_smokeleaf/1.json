Get over yourself, shut up and play. Got better reflexes? use them in game PLAYING not typing like a nob. Want to complain to people? Go write a twitterlong or some shit.\n\nOkey, what actions are you talking about?\nNo sorry I wont shut up, because who are you to tell me to shut up?\nWhy dont you grow some intellect and a personality and then approch me with some substance that we can actually discuss?`\nAs of now, you attack me for things that you dont know and again: Just like my opinion, your opnion is useless.\n\nnob? The door nob or misspelled \"n00b\" ?\n\nI dont want to complain, but you are really offtopic, no worries, moderators here are not fit to judge what is offtopic anyways.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Tactrix","date":"2017-11-20T13:32:08.773+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm gonna give you the biggest tip you'll ever get in this game, /mute all, there is no reason for you not to, even at challenger levels the players only speak in discord or real life, they don't even bother to type in chat.","replies":[{"poster":"Rhasta Smokeleaf","date":"2017-11-20T13:40:05.540+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Tactrix,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=TzIyRU1V,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2017-11-20T13:32:08.773+0000)\n>\n> I&#x27;m gonna give you the biggest tip you&#x27;ll ever get in this game, /mute all, there is no reason for you not to, even at challenger levels the players only speak in discord or real life, they don&#x27;t even bother to type in chat.\n\nBeen there, done that...\nGuess what happen?\nI got 3 friendrequests after that game... and 20 min of 3 people telling me how much we would have won if I had not muted them all.\n\nSorry, there is no winning here.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Scary Door","date":"2017-11-20T13:16:22.026+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My God, do you ever shut up during games?

I think you are jealous of me being able to multitask, play and talk at the same time... and do it at a fiarly decent level and winning games... So why are you jealous of my ability to multitask and why are you so lazy you dont work on your own ability to multitask?\n\nSure you report me too, and this is what I have made threads about... you have pride and you feel shame. WHenever questioning your pride or shame you report them, no matter if its true or not. Its as if you call me something bad, lets say \"Twister\" , and I call you \"humm\"... then you report me to the police for saying \"humm\" and leave our you did call me twister. Im not allowing you to restrict my life and Im not restricting your life, so wtf mate? Why are you holding me to different standards as you do yourself?\n\nI am the most toxic person i nthe world.\n\nOfc I am annoying to anyone who cant argue with me... that is common sense that anyone dumb arguing with anyone smart gets annoyed that he cant comprehend and lack the knowledge... very understandable and logical and resonable.\n\nSorry, I wont shut up and I wont listen to you becuase just like my opinion... your opinion is useless.","replies":[]}]}]}
