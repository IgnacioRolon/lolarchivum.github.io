Ever wonder why Mages feel weak this season? Probably partially because Caster-ADCs do almost as good of a job waveclearing and harassing as proper mages except also have lifesteal + DPS. I remember S2-S4 when teams grouped, the ADC would cease to get CS because the mage would waveclear it all, now it&#039;s just about the complete opposite.\n* I&#039;m sure theoretically they&#039;re supposed to trade raw-DPS in exchange for their burst and mobility, but I really don&#039;t see them doing that much less DPS than a normal ADC especially considering they dominate lane so hard\n* They&#039;re untouchable. Nothing better than the good ol&#039; Ezreal/Morgana combo where even if you manage to touch Ezreal despite his 9001 range and happens to not have Morgana&#039;s black shield on, he manages to blink through 90% of CC abilities anyway.\n* The worst part is they&#039;re in every goddam game. They&#039;re so oppressive that we just see them as the norm for ADCs now. We&#039;ve completely forgotten the original &#039;normal&#039; ADCs like Ashe/Jinx/Draven. It&#039;s gotten to the point where when I gank bot lane, I subconsciously focus the support because I know the ADC is just going to dash away and shoot me in the face 40 times.\n\n\nAll I want is for these champions to be an option, not mandatory. ATM they completely crowd out other ADCs, which is super lame because their design is centered around being annoying and frustrating.","replies":[{"poster":"UltÃ®ma","date":"2016-04-19T14:35:09.249+0000","up_votes":28,"down_votes":0,"body":"**Given the general discontent with Zed, why do we tolerate these hyper-mobile caster ADCs?**\n\nBecause Riot forces us to lol","replies":[]},{"poster":"WalkingInACircle","date":"2016-04-19T14:41:58.031+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":2,"body":"A mana cost and relevant minion positioning.\n\nZed: \nIs my Q on cooldown?
