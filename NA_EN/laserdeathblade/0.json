Most players main a small pool of champions, and theoretically the champions are supposed to be balanced. However, there are a huge set of rune combinations that offer strategic advantages for a specific champion and/or playstyle. Players should be free to experiment with their rune setup, as it's pretty much the only thing you'll start a game with that will offer significantly different stats/power from the other 9 players.\n\nEx: \n-A farm heavy jungle player will probably want AS Quints, a gank oriented player might want MS quints\n-A nasus player might want to offset Nasus's weak early game with Armor Quints, a Riven player is going to want AD Quints\n-A LB will value penetration runes more than an Orianna player\n-etc. etc.\n\nNow let's discuss how astronomical rune costs currently are. A lot of more experienced players have forgotten the pain of grinding out IP, and need to be reminded.\n\nLet's use this account as an example. I have a relatively small champion pool:\n -Top: Tryndamere, Jax\n-Mid: LeBlanc, TF\n-Jungle: Udyr\n-ADC: Vayne, Jinx\n-Support: LeBlanc\n\n**Now let's calculate the cost of optimizing runes for my 7 champions, which is a far-cry from a big champion pool. **\n\nThe average game is ~30 minutes long. A 30 minute win grants 90 LP, a 30 minute loss grants 60 LP. You will average out at ~75 IP every 30 minutes of IN-GAME play - not including the time you spend in queue which can be anywhere between 2 and 15 minutes.\n\n*In other words, first win of the day aside, it takes ~164 In-game minutes to farm 410 LP, AKA the cost of the least expensive T3 Rune.*\n\n**Let's start with the most basic rune page:**\n\n9 AD Reds (3690IP) : 49.2 games = 1476 minutes\n9 Health Yellows (7380IP) : 98.4 games = 2952 minutes\n9 Flat MR Blues : 738 minutes \n3 AD Quints: 1230 minutes\n\nThis would work for {{champion:222}} \n\nNow let's move on to {{champion:23}} . These are additional runes I would preferably swap out:\n9 AS Reds : 1476 minutes\n9 Armor  Yellows : 738 minutes\n9 AS blues : 1476 minutes\n3 LS Quints : 2460 minutes\n\nNow {{champion:24}} :\n3rd Rune Page : 2520 minutes\n3 AS Quints: 1230 minutes\n\n{{champion:7}} :\n4th Rune Page: 2520 minutes\n9 Hybrid Penetration: 2952 minutes\n3 AP Quints : 1230 minutes\n\n{{champion:4}} :\n5th Rune page : 2520 minutes\n3 MS Quints : 2460 minutes\n9 M.Pen Reds : 1476 minutes\n9 Scaling Health Yellows : 1476 minutes\n\n{{champion:77}} :\n6th Rune page : 2520 minutes\n6 CDR Blues : 1968 minutes\n\n{{champion:67}} :\nNothing, luckily\n\n\nSo to set up my preferred runes, it'd take:\n** 105,400 IP\n1405 Games\n42,160 minutes\n702 Hours\n29 Days**\nJust to build optimal rune pages for my pool of 7 Champions.\n\nAre some of these runes absolutely  necessary? Yes - In fact most of them are, that is, if you want to win. Some champions benefit so greatly from a unique rune page that you're really just shooting yourself in the foot without a proper page. (Ex: Trynd)\n\nAre all of these runes absolutely necessary? No - not really, but they are really desirable to me as a player because it allows me to play with a distinct style.\n\n\n\nOk, so I'm no fool - I just paid RP for my 7-rune page bundle, I've purchased IP boosts, and I actually bought a lot of my champions with RP so it doesn't actually take me like 30 straight days in-game to farm my runes; But make no mistake, Runes are definitely passing into the territory of 'pay to win', and a great deal of players aren't really willing to dish out the big RPs just for runes.","replies":[{"poster":"Kira Onime","date":"2014-11-07T02:52:58.077+0000","up_votes":35,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'd rather see tier 2 runes removed entirely and tier 3 dropped to tier 2 price.","replies":[{"poster":"Dies to Wolves","date":"2014-11-07T08:25:28.464+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I'd rather see tier 2 runes removed entirely and tier 3 dropped to tier 2 price.\n\nyes, that'd be great\n\nor at the very *least*, riot should normalize all rune costs to the lowest possible (that is, NO 820 runes and 2k quints, that's just retardedly nonsensically expensive)","replies":[{"poster":"Kira Onime","date":"2014-11-07T15:44:13.529+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> > I'd rather see tier 2 runes removed entirely and tier 3 dropped to tier 2 price.\n> \n> yes, that'd be great\n> \n> or at the very *least*, riot should normalize all rune costs to the lowest possible (that is, NO 820 runes and 3k quints, that's just retardedly nonsensically expensive)\n\nMax quints are 2k but still, bloody expensive.\n3 quints is basically a new champion.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Legostrike","date":"2014-11-07T02:49:42.763+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":1,"body":"This post is very true, and don't tell me it isn't.

I actually think they should remove the limit on runes that you can have and give a full 9 set of all t1 runes just so you can experiment and see what you like.
