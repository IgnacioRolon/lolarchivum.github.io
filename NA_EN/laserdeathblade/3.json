( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"Tristana has long since been one of my favorite champions \n\n(because I'm a pedophile ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) ) \n\nIt's not often that I think Riot does well with major updates, but the new Tristana is definitely wayyy cooler (sexier) than the old one.\n\n{{champion:18}} \n\nShe's more fun to play, no longer feels like a walking glitch-ball, has a kit that makes sense, and looks hot to boot (because I'm a weeb  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) )\n\n\n**But there's still some small things to still work on:**\n\n* Although her AA's are infinitely less bad, they're still buggy where they won't apply damage sometimes if you're stutter-stepping, even if the projectile reaches the target. This is a glitch across the board (even though it was allegedly fixed some time ago) but it's super noticeable on Tristana\n\n* Her Jump. Wat. It's buggy as hell. It's interaction with CC is weird, and just the way its coded overall is screwed up. I just had a game where I jumped and tried to flash over a wall, but I fail flashed because I'm LCS Material and dropped me to where my jump began for some reason. I can't really replicate the bug (because no game editor *cough*) but you can trust me, I'm a believable guy who you wouldn't mind being around your daughters","replies":[{"poster":"InsaneSamurai","date":"2015-01-28T20:29:59.225+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"I still cant believe they decided her biggest op move was just fine and they could not only refuse to nerf it, but actually give it a buff.
