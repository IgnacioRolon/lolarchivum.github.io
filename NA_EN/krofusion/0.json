I was curious when I saw that.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-08T01:15:45.032+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It doesn't look like that skin is available in the store right now, but it doesn't seem like she's listed on [**limited/legacy skin**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752944) guide either. I think this skin might actually be one that's not obtainable right now, so it's a little rarer than you initially thought!","replies":[{"poster":"Krofusion","date":"2017-11-09T22:04:24.391+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So is there supposed to be no symbol on it even though it's an unobtainable skin?
