Welcome to Let’s Discuss, a community-let project where we get to focus discussion around a selected topic, and give concentrated, high-quality feedback to Riot. To start off this series, let’s discuss **Rengar**: a controversial champion even after two reworks, he continues to upset many players to this day. This includes even his own core players, many of whom have major issues with his most recent rework, and whose collective efforts and communication with us Gameplay Wardens led to the creation of this megathread.\n\nBefore you post, here are some core rules:\n\n* **Constructive discussion above all:** This is the golden rule. We all have different opinions, and some of these opinions are almost certainly going to clash with each other. This is not an excuse to disrespect each other or derail conversation into personal arguments. If you are going to post here, it is going to be with the intent of contributing to the topic of discussion, and by extension the game as a whole. We Wardens will be monitoring this thread very closely to make sure this happens. \n* **Stay concise:** because there’s going to be a lot of discussion, and because others are going to be reading through this, it is important to keep things as brief as possible. This is not the place to post your full 3-page rework concept, even if a link to it or a few key suggestions will help. Be sure to read through the major conversations here, as well as the summary below, to check if something you want to share has been said before. Focus discussion about Rengar on this thread: We’ve all seen Gameplay blow up with half a dozen threads on the front page talking about more or less the same topic. This is a chance to avoid that: if you see this megathread and want to talk about Rengar, post here! You’ll have a higher chance of getting feedback from others, as well as Riot’s attention.\n* **If you disagree, respond, don't downvote:** Tbh this should be a general rule across Gameplay, but the downvote button is not for when you disagree with someone else's opinion. If a player is legitimately being toxic and disrupting conversation, you can downvote them, and are encouraged to report them, but otherwise hold off of that button and instead try to formulate a reply that states why you disagree.\n* **Try to frame your feedback around these three questions (this is more of a guideline):** \n * **What is your criticism of the current state of Rengar?** \n * **What do you want Rengar’s gameplay fantasy to be?** \n * **What changes would you suggest to Rengar?**\n\nGood luck, and happy commenting! Be sure to check on this thread in the future, as we’ll be filling out the summary in this OP of this megathread’s current major talking points.\n\nHere are some of the major points that have sprung up often in discussion:\n\n* **Criticism of Rengar's current state:**\n * Bonetooth Necklace's stacking bonus AD feels like a missed opportunity, as its bonuses feel pretty bland and not particularly interactive for Rengar or his opponents.\n * Savagery in its current state feels clunky due to its animation lock, and doesn't feel like it meshes well with the rest of Rengar's current kit.\n * Battle Roar feels like it clashes with Rengar's playstyle in its current state due to its reactive nature, which works against his Ferocity stacking, and its heal based on damage taken, which makes him feel like he's soaking up tons of damage, rather than playing well.\n * The guaranteed crit mechanic on Rengar's ultimate does not feel appropriate.\n * The telegraphing to Rengar's ult feels excessive in some circumstances, as organized teams get plenty of time to group up and deny Rengar any kind of opening.\n * Rengar doesn't feel like he's outplaying his opponents, or that he has the option to do so.\n * Rengar's diver and assassin aspects currently do not mesh well on a thematic and gameplay level; some of the things he does feel like they clash against others. W, for example, feels appropriate for a diver, but not for an assassin.\n * Rengar still needs more counterplay, but his ult does not feel like the right place to add it.\n* **Rengar's Gameplay Fantasy:**\n * Emphasis on fluidity of movement and speed.\n * It's important that Rengar gets to force duels through his stealth and roaming.\n * Rengar is a champion who should be great at making picks.\n * One-shotting is **not** an aspect of Rengar that seems particularly popular, even among his core players.\n * Players are relatively split on whether Rengar should be more of a diver, or more of an assassin, generally leaning slightly towards assassin. Many players want him to be a hybrid of both.\n * Rengar is a proactive champion with an emphasis on preparation, rather than reaction.\n * Emphasis on interactivity: Rengar should win a fight due to good preparation and skill in combat, not through spam or \"free\" power.\n* **Suggested Changes:**\n * Change Bonetooth Necklace's effects into bonuses that are both more interesting to Rengar, and more interactive for his targets.\n * Change Q into something more fluid, or revert it into its autoattack reset while still trying to give it more interactivity.\n * Alter W to be more proactive, rather than reactive.\n * Remove the guaranteed crit on ult.\n * Tone down or remove the warning on the ult so that Rengar can still catch targets by surprise.","replies":[{"poster":"Rengylvania","date":"2017-07-19T20:02:30.083+0000","up_votes":89,"down_votes":12,"body":"•    Criticism of Rengar: Bonetooth Necklace’s bonus AD is a pretty boring and uninteractive effect. Leap feels a bit too slow and is needlessly difficult to use on Baron/Drake. \nSavagery feels similarly clunky due to the built-in delay and disconnect with the rest of his kit, yet still doesn’t feel particularly interactive either. \nBattle Roar goes against Rengar’s natural flow of combat, as its reactive nature works especially poorly with his empowerment mechanic.\nThrill of the Hunt has been given both counterplay and power in the wrong places, with the free crit feeling unnecessary, and the camouflage/indicator turning his ult into a mere zoning tool once teams know how to play against Rengar.\nGenerally, Rengar still doesn’t feel like he has the proper toolset to outplay his opponents, which is also why he still doesn’t feel fun to play against.\n\n\n•    My ideal Rengar: Rengar to me represents the ultimate jungle hunter. \nHe is all about the hunt. His greatest strength, and highest moments, should be him picking out isolated targets, and forcing them into a duel to the death.\nPlayers should be afraid of rotating when Rengar is on the other team, because they should know that they’re going to be hunted down and jumped on at any moment. \nBecause of this, he should be a diver with assassin traits, i.e. a survivable duelist with stealth and exceptional speed, rather than an assassin with diver traits. He is a high-risk, high-reward champion, and every fight should feel difficult and skill-focused for both sides involved.\n\n\n•    How to improve Rengar: change Bonetooth Necklace to offer more interactive bonuses, preferably better mobility and roaming options, instead of raw AD.\nRequiring more kills to reach each bonus could also give Rengar more things to do over the course of the game, as well as allow for better-paced and potentially more impactful bonuses.\nRemove the delay on his leap, and change Savagery into a smooth AA cancel while still giving the mechanic more interactivity. \nChange Battle Roar into a proactive spell, and make it better-suited towards squishier builds, instead of letting Rengar soak up and ignore tons of damage.\nBola Strike has a few bugs that need fixing, but is otherwise perfect. \nThrill of the Hunt needs to lose its artificial crit, but either make it to lose its indicator or lower the alert range.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n***If you want a more complete indeepth analysis, you can read it*** [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rengarmains/comments/6o3vqv/rengar_megathread_is_hitting_the_na_gameplay/dkf3nxl/)","replies":[{"poster":"Rito Staff","date":"2017-07-19T20:13:40.779+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":8,"body":"Isn't isolation, 1v1 more to do with {{champion:121}} though? :P Hunt is for Rengar, however that may translate into game mechanics, but getting someone isolated is Kha thing (every assassin in a way.. so it really shouldn't be mentioned)","replies":[{"poster":"Rengylvania","date":"2017-07-20T00:42:40.345+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":2,"body":"Rengar and Kha'Zix are two half's of the same coin. Having that similarity would make sense.\n\nThey are both \"hunters\" but their perspective point of view is different still the core is there\n\nNothing is wrong on  that part\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nYou shouldn't focus on \"isolate\" like that.While it is true that assassin have that in a way Rengar and Kha Zix are special\n\nKha Zix is focused on isolating for the Q meanwhile Rengar have always been that champion to find and try to force an important target to leave the group. Rengar doesn't have an escape and with that it means once he goes in there is no going back\n\nThat's a trait that's especially focused on isolated targets.Find one or lure one(it was quite often to see that happening tbh)\n\nA LOT of Rengar mains used to make the so called  \"chicken\" tactic\n\n- Kill all the melee minions of one wave meanwhile leaving the casters alive.That would result in a slow wave pushing towards the enemy team and by doing that someone was being forced to defend that lane AKA a free way to lure out an enemy for Rengar in order to kill while you were waiting for the adc on the bush\n\nRengar have always been a champion to look out for isolated champions compering to other assassin with tools to get out of a situation,\n\nIsolation would be the best and safest way in order to gain a trophy/stack\n\nYou must admit that it's not irrelevant for Rengar to have it as he's supposed to be mirror champion to Kha'Zix. Similar to Riven having three phases (casts) of Q like Yasuo.\n\n\n I mean take a look at their release date\n\n> Rengar 2012-08-21\n\n> Kha Zix 2012-09-27\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nYou can even notice this trait on his lore\n\n> A lifetime of scars had taught Rengar the secret of hunting: it wasn't about being strong. It was about knowing when to withdraw, and when to attack.\n\n>Right now? It was time to withdraw.\n\n\nAt the end he did withdraw to just lure the beast and take him out via using his hunting tools.It's clearly shown that he didn't either called for help or received any help aside from a well thought 1vs1 with the animal\n\nAlso take a good note especially at this part\n\n\n> Feel something. Something new. Something terrible. Not hunger, anger, joy.\n\n>Fear\n\n\nSo how can we try to relate this the most inside an actual game?It's pretty simple,ofc the chances to get feared shall be higher if you take a target alone outside from a party.He is more fragile and shall loose courage easier\n\nThis part is also shown on the Predator movies(where Riot took inspiration from)\n\n \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n- Since the very beginning Rengar was that champion to either go in front of 5 enemies and slain one for one aka trade himself for the adc\n\n- Find the perfect timing and kill 1 target/more than one\n\n- Look out for or force an important target to leave the group and kill him while being  isolated","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kadius","date":"2017-07-19T20:15:36.252+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":2,"body":"Picking isolated targets is indeed an assassin trait.

Or at least at their first release they used to be.\nAgreed that the hunt is not like waiting for targets to isolate and destroy them to evolve your tools. But it is similar.\n\nRengar does not need an \"Isolated theme\" but the Thrill of the Hunt as it was annouced by Riot was a tool to Hunt down a prey alone with Rengars Kinfes represented by the old Attack speed that both (At first release) normal and Emp version of the Q given.\n\nI think giving a \"Isolated/Hunter\" theme to Rengar would be very nice.

I don't respond to many Rengar threads (because many seem to be trying to say the same things and it tends to feel like a dead horse is being beaten), but I do try and read all of them here and on places like rengarmains regardless. That said, the effort put in here is, at the very least, admirable and collaborative, so it seems like a decent place to speak up.\n\nRengar is far from perfect in his current state. I'll be the first to admit that. I do remember feeling more nervous (than other updates I've been a part of) than usual prior to his release, because it felt like we took some pretty drastic steps to try to accomplish difficult gameplay goals. Some of these worked out well. Others did not. Outside any individual item, to me, the single biggest shortcoming of the update is that he feels too different too play to really feel like the same champion, which I suppose tends to feel quite bad as some kind of confirmation of my pre-release nerves. The experience has been valuable to me as we hone in on the ingredients of a great update and the risks we may feel comfortable taking, but that should be of little consolation to players that may be feeling betrayed by this update (or any other, really).\n\nI've read many ideas for what we could do or ought to have done for Rengar, and still, I'm not sure what would be best. It is easy to know what doesn't work. It can be difficult to know what will. In the spirit of thus thread, below will be my thoughts on Rengar's kit. Keep in mind that this isn't a commitment to any type of incoming change.\n\nP\nI do think the changes to Ferocity generation were a great improvement to Rengar's gameplay, and I believe that this bonetooth is an improvement over the previous one, even if its progression and rewards are not as good as they could be. I'm unsure about the leap elements of the passive that get don't complaints, as I tried to set the range/speed/frequency as high as I could without being unfair to opponents, and I think that some of the complaints about these things mostly come from no longer being able to do some of the same exact jumping behaviors. I agree thus feels bad if you've learned all of them, but I still think the changes made here were generally acceptable. \n\nQ\nIf I were to do it again, I would take more of an approach of \"keep Q the same at all costs.\" The spell is mostly good in isolation mechanically (could be a decent spell on a different kit), but just feels bland, rushed, and uninspired here, primarily if you were attached to the previous Q. This said, reverting to the previous Q would result in the kit being back in a state where all of its damage could be applied instantly, and we were trying to move away from that for his update (which, at a goals level, I still do think is correct).\n\nW\nI don't think this spell is perfect, but I stand by it being mechanically better than the previous version. Whether that's true or not, honestly neither version is amazing. It's possible this should have been a new spell entirely, or that it should have part of a more extensive effort to make all of Rengar's instant cast spells not just stackable in the same instant. There is something to be said for the familiarity and simplicity of the spell, I suppose.\n\nE\nBola is mostly fine. I was shocked by how many players complained that they couldn't instant cast it during leap, but I do think it having a cast time at all times was the right call.\n\nR\nAfter the Ferocity changes, I think the gains made to R's play for opponents was a definitive step in the right direction for Rengar's kit. I think there some merit to the spell having TOO much counterplay for opponents in the approach and not enough once he's there, but the spell seems far, far better for the game than the previous version, and with some tweaks, could be really great. I also know people tend to complain about the \"free\" crit on it, but I think rewarding jumping to the right target is appropriate, and damage seems appropriate as well. Perhaps it's the word crit? Maybe it should just be some kind of bonus damage. I'm not entirely sure, but that seems tunable.\n\nPattern\nI'm not really concerned about whether people think Rengar is an assassin, diver, bruiser, fighter, skirmisher, or whatever. There seems to be enough division there that satisfying a singe singular majority doesn't seem possible.\n\nClosing\nDespite tending to think we made mostly good calls and took mostly good risks with Rengar's update, I think it's pretty clear that the changes to Q primarily tend to overshadow these. In my opinion, Rengar would have been best served by keeping the mechanics of pre-rework Q at all costs, though the way to accomplish that and still hit game health and counterplay goals we aimed for are still unclear, and are unlikely as simple as some passionate players may make it out to be. I'm thankful that League is a constantly changing game where we may get to circle back and revisit changes like these in the future.\n\nThanks for taking the time and effort to put this post together. I know that sometimes it may feel like we aren't listening or don't care when something like this posted and maybe there's no response from a Rioter, but I do think it's rare that we're just turning a blind eye to something players care about. I apologize that it sometimes feels otherwise, and that we (I personally, on this case) don't always make the right calls, but I am thankful for feedback like this that keeps us in touch with player sentiment and helps us to improve moving forward.","replies":[{"poster":"Noctum Flower","date":"2017-07-20T20:50:01.102+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you so much for taking the time to respond to us. I wanted to talk about your response towards his kit.\n\nP\nI do believe changing the ferocity system was a step in the right direction, and I guess yes, the AD gain from passive is better. But it doesn't really feel correct. Mementos of the Hunt IMO should represent actual rewards. Take Kindred completing a mark for example, her rewards synergize with her kit much better than Rengar's. \n\nQ\nIf you're worried about the old Q, the thing is that, old Rengar with his ferocity system would hold on to Ferocity Q -> Normal Q -> Ferocity Q -> Normal Q. The way Rengar's new ferocity system is, this shouldn't exactly be a worrisome thing.\n> This said, reverting to the previous Q would result in the kit being back in a state where all of its damage could be applied instantly, and we were trying to move away from that for his update (which, at a goals level, I still do think is correct).\n\nCurrenty Rengar's leap crit is what's making all his damage apply instantly. https://youtu.be/w34d1g7FEgE?t=38 take this video from YoumuusYT for example. The leap is doing pretty much all the damage, which is why we proposed to remove the leap crit.\n\nW\nI believe a new W would be better. The old W I'll accept had it's problems. However Rengar's W was used more of a proactive spell than a reactive spell as it is currently. You also see Rengar as a bruiser/diver. Leaping in dealing his damage and then pressing W for the instant heal and getting out. I don't see this as healthy gameplay. But I would accept a new ability.\n\nE\nI think the cast time is fine, I do wish it could be removed however the cast time does help Rengar. I hope you can remove his bugs with it however.\n\nR\nTweaking would be very nice, it is a proper step in the right direction and it's much better than the old ultimate. However, I do believe the ult has too much counterplay right now. But with the right tweaks it's fixable.\n\nPattern\nI really want a flexible Rengar, he's always been a diver, just built as an assassin mostly, and that's what a lot of players enjoyed more so. With the release of Kayn, I think making Rengar an adaptable hunter would be a good idea. \n\nAgain, thank you very much for responding, and I do hope Rengar gets worked on again, and if I'm able to make a preposition. If Rengar does get brought up again, please make a post similar to Azir with 2 or more directions in mind. Thanks for your time.\nEDIT: Please bring back the Rengar sound effects from before, we like those much better than the current ones.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Teridax68","date":"2017-07-20T21:14:16.663+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":4,"body":"Hi RiotRepertoir!\n\nFirst off, thank you so much for posting on this megathread!

Maybe make his regular W grant tenacity and let his ferocity W heal for a flat amount like before rework and remove CC like now?\n\nE: Is fine.\n\nR: The alert range needs to get significantly decreased so that it feels more like a hunt rather than a military call for the enemy team to group. Enemy shouldn't get alerted before I could jump either, either make both the alert and invisibility instant or make both have a 2 second delay. The alert indicator on the nearest target however, is fair counterplay.\n\nPassive: Good change. Prevents ferocity burst build up before ulting. Bonetooth is a little problematic and could be more creative but seems okay like this.\n\nEdit: W idea","replies":[{"poster":"PixelzGr","date":"2017-07-19T20:25:26.208+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":0,"body":"> R: The alert range needs to get significantly decreased so that it feels more like a hunt rather than a military call for the enemy team to group. \n\nMilitary call \nam done xD","replies":[]},{"poster":"Penns","date":"2017-07-19T20:23:07.732+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":32,"body":"Assassin damage isnt supposed to be instant and unavoidable anymore tho.

In this post I will be going over the core issues that I have found with the recently reworked Rengar and some possible changes that could make his play style healthier for both the player playing him and those playing against him.\n\n**Passive**: General consensus of this would be that his passive feels unsatisfying, yet it gives raw stats and is valuable in his kit at the same time.\nPossible changes: Allocating some parts of the raw power from passive stats to more a utility based style without drastically changing his kill windows or ranges.\nExamples: Longer slow E/ giving a movespeed buff in bushes/ increased armor/magic resistance in bushes. (While Rengar is known for being a bush assassin, he gains very little in terms of raw combat stats when legitimately fighting enemies in bushes.)\n\n**Q**: I believe that this ability is the cause of many problems that arise for Rengar at the moment. A problem that many people neglect to see which is that it bottlenecks his playstyle and versatility. With the change to his Q from an auto attack based ability to a skill shot dash, he has lost many of the playstyle options previously available to him. \nSome examples of this loss would be (Fervor of battle/Warlords bloodlust/Critical strike builds/Lifesteal builds/On-Hit builds)\nPossible changes: Reverting his Q to the old auto attack reset based ability. This would reopen his other variety of play styles and make his game play much healthier. Making current Q apply On-Hit effects twice dealing 50% damage on each, similar to reworked Urgot W. \n\n**W**: The changes to W put Rengar in a very good position in terms of crowd control counterplay. This skill is in a perfect spot if not a bit overpowered.\nPossible changes: Lowering base numbers.\n\n**E**: Perfect as is.\n\n**R**: Rengar's R is very iconic and unique to his playstyle, however the ability itself can be somewhat frustrating to play against. With the recent additions to several items and reworks in the game, his R has much more raw killing power than before. This creates a situation where it is much less of a scouting and hunting tool and instead a \"Give my next auto attack 700 range and a leap with double damage\"\nPossible changes: Remove the crit from the auto attack or make it a lower damage crit (similar to Jhin, Yasuo, Shaco.)\nWith a free crit, Rengar will never be a high skill capped champion because so much of his burst would be extremely simple to execute with 1 auto attack in R. Spreading out the raw power of his ult crit throughout his kit and allowing Rengar vision of all champions in his radius again would create a better gameplay.\n\nTL;DR: {{champion:107}} Rengar has become much simpler and 1 dimensional because of the reworks. This stems from his new Q limiting playstyle and the burst from a crit enabling ultimate.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rengooo","date":"2017-07-19T20:11:38.044+0000","up_votes":36,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just want to clarify something for everyone to keep in mind when reading the comments here, simply because it seems to be a very commonly raised and contested point.\n\nFor the majority of players who want Rengar back in one way or another, it IS NOT because we just want to one shot in style and drink the tears of our enemies who died before they could blink. \n\nWe enjoyed Rengar because of his fun and fluid play style... \nHis theme as a badass hunter... \nAnd his unique and satisfying abilities and visuals... \n\nI mean...

I guess before I get into the crux of the issue (Rengar’s balance), I’ll start by discussing what Rengar means to me so you know that what I’m about to say comes from the heart. In season 5 I was still very new to League (about a seasons worth of experience) and had only hit level 30 in the pre-season. I hoped into ranked for the first time and dabbled with champions here, there and everywhere. One champ I played to level 5 when the mastery system first came out was Rengar. I believe my 4 big champs were Rengar, Thresh, Yasuo and Riven. To this day those 4 are still my highest mastery level 7s funnily enough. While I enjoyed Rengar, I wouldn’t say I was a “main” until the end of the season and maybe pre-season 6. The new masteries interested me greatly, and the OP Thundlerlord’s meta of Season 6 made me into a Rengar spammer through and through. The meta fit him very well since the burst it gave helped Rengar do his job. He quickly became my favourite champion and carried me out of bronze. Rengar to this day is the only champion where I learnt the paths, routes and strats Challengers used and genuinely tried to replicate their gameplay. It worked well! I was destroying low elo. I went from going 0/12 every game to 12/0 and saw great improvement in my micro choices. I guess for all extensive purposes, this meant I was a one-trick, since all my knowledge was on the one champion. For this reason, Rengar has always had a very special place in my heart, and I continue to endure him even in his current, disjointed form. So when I say new Rengar is really not the Rengar I once loved, please know it comes from thousands of hours of dedication to the champion and not inexperienced guessing. So, onto my ideals about Rengar.\n\nThe current state of Rengar.\nRengar currently is stronger, hands down. He oneshots easier, he has AoE burst (previously only single target with Tiamat and W for AoE), faster clears, more sustain, CC cleanse, longer duration ult, further leap range at level 1 and much more. I could go on, he’s a much more OP champ kit-wise than before. However, he is far, far less fun. Rengar used to be a very high-skillcapped champion. I know many ADC mains think that Rengar was braindead “leap onto carry smash face get kill” character, when that’s not true… that’s Zed. Rengar on the otherhand, was a tactical and thought out assassin with a high APM requirement and excellent game-sense. Rengar used to require the player to build 5 stacks before going on a hunt, and to have a general idea of where the ADC was through the fog of war. This was mainly due to the fact that Rengar only had a 12 second duration on his ult at the very most, which made his options for running around and finding people very limited compared to the current 20 second duration at level 16. He required a decent amount of mechanical skill too, and this is someone with over 250k mastery points on Riven so I can definitely comment on mechanical difficulty. Rengar used to have a small combo where you would leap to a target, and Q after. It sounds simple, but timing your Q to be frame perfect just after the leap ended to get an AA + Q on a target instead of just a Q is the difference between blowing a flash or getting a kill. It took me hours in custom games to get it to be almost frame-perfect and even then I still marvelled at Dekar and Ryan Choi over how they could get their Qs to be so smooth. Now however, spamming Q mid-jump has no consequence so to execute your Q after a leap you just leap on someone and spam your Q while in the air for easy burst. His “oneshot combo” in general was very hard to master too. Think about Zed, most Zeds I see press R and go COMPLETELY UNTARGETTABLE before pressing E to chunk an ADC down 1/3 of their HP and than an AA to drop them below half with duskblade. They then R away completely untouched and than their R pops, popping Tlords and deleting the ADC. That is “easy burst”. However old Rengar’s combo used to be very infamous in and amongst the Rengar community. The empowered Q, Youmuus, leap, E mid air, W + Tiamat as you landed almost ensured a kill, but that is 6 buttons that you have to execute within the span of half a second, not to mention it involves aiming a fucking skillshot MID AIR. It was definitely easy to mess up, and messing it up meant the ADC could easily flash out of your range and kite you to death with the movespeed from heal etc. However now Rengar’s oneshot combo is Right click. Not even joking, I have oneshot so many carries by just jumping on them with Rengar’s free ult crit and a lethality build. My point is the new Rengar is basically the same champion, just simplified. You had to time your leaps to kill your target, build your stacks beforehand and become a true hunter, planning out the kill. Now you just press R whenever and crit someone for 2.5k damage. Rengar is not less powerful, in fact he’s more so, he is just more simple, less fun and more one-dimentional. He lacks versatility, creativity and multidimensional gameplay. Not to mention his new W is completely unfair to vs. Really Riot? Heal for 100% of the damage taken in the last 3 seconds if you press W twice? That’s a bit unfair.\n\nRengar Gameplay Fantasy\nRengar should be an assassin, a ruthless predator. One of the COOLEST THINGS about Rengar previously was his ult. Like a TF ult, but instead of a global “reveal” it was a radius-based detection. Instead of a TP you got a leap. However it was on a shorter cooldown and he went invisible so it had it’s pros. It was a great ability, every time I’d use it I’d feel like a true hunter. Revealing nearby enemies to path through enemy lines and find a target. Now I feel like I have to play some lame minigame to be able to crit who I want. Rengar should be a tactful, high-skillcapped hunter assassin, not some clunky leap cat like he got turned into.\n\nMy proposed changed\nPassive: Keep the leap (obviously). The bonetooth is great. The system of being able to kill 1 target over and over and get stronger was a very bad system, the new system for gathering stacks works much better. However, the bonuses it gives of just “bonus AD” is super lame, not exciting or unique, doesn’t offer new ways to play the game. Before, his bonetooth would change how you played after every bonus, now you just do the same stuff but you do it better, which is boring. I propose Riot brings back the old utility bonuses of his passive while keeping the unique kills stacking system of current Rengar.\nAs for Ferocity, revert it to the same 5 stack system so he can return to premeditated hunting and not being able to spam damage in fights mindlessly.\n\nQ: Revert it. Old Q was one of the smoothest, coolest, fun and interesting abilities in game. The sound was satisfying, the ways it flowed and interacted with his kit made sense and it overall felt good. I do propose some changed to the empowered Q though. No attackspeed. Attackspeed woul help Rengar shred tanks and clear faster in theory, but most what it’s used for is allowing a full AD assassin to deal crazy DPS and shred people with autos. Instead I believe it should do a large bleed to the target on top of the increased up-front burst to help clear and shred tanks as it’s intended, but keep his identity as a burst assassin in tact. Could either be a large bleed or a small-medium bleed that also applied grievous wounds so ADCs can’t heal through his burst. However, I believe it should be a large bleed that heals you for 100% of the damage done over time since the heal from his W is going to be gone with my W proposal.\n\nW: A preparation style ability. Rengar crouches down for X amount of seconds, rooting himself in place and allowing him to use Unseen Predator to leap to a target. Empowered version grants CC immunity while crouched and damage reduction. The ability can be cancelled any time without leaping by inputting a move command. The problems with his W currently is the heal. Being able to heal back a large portion of damage your enemies deal has no place on an assassin, neither does in-combat healing and armour/mr like his old W. The CC immunity is actually fine, it stops Rengar from being a sitting duck when outside of a bush. What IS a problem is the ability to move while CC immune so you can RUN AWAY or THROUGH A TEAM that can’t catch/peel you. Being able to crouch down and wait for cooldowns is very predator like and helps you gain a second leap which makes Rengar more versatile. This leap should probably be shorter than his other leaps to make you able to flash away from Rengar. This ability will, obviously, reduce his burst so it needs to be added in elsewhere. This is where that large bleed I mentioned earlier comes in!\n\nE: Same good stuff, the bola. A core part of Rengar. However, an instant root from stealth due to his E is super unhealthy to play against. Instead I believe it should be gradual. Bolas take time to wrap around people in real life, why is it different for Rengar? Basic slow goes from 0% slow to the full 90% after 1 second, and remains at 90% for 1 second. Empowered E goes from 90% slow to a root over 1 second, and stays as a root for 1 second. This means people can flash under tower and force Rengar to chase out of position to follow-up on the snare, creating counter play opportunities for those that are clever but allowing Rengar to still do his job. A win-win situation for both sides of the spectrum.\n\nR: Thrill of the Hunt. Rengar enters a hyper-sense state that reveals nearby enemies but does not go invisible. Instead he is able to have a free leap and gains a tremendous amount of movement speed when moving towards enemies. Perhaps also make him CC immune during the leap since you can see where he’s coming. This is an extreme change but my point is simple. Rengar mains do not care about going invis, in fact camouflage is useless. Invisibility had it’s uses, but I have never used camouflage effectively once. I would rather have no camouflage and a reveal than some shitty version of invisibility and a lack of clarity/hunting.

So I’m going to point out the biggest reason as to why Rengar’s kit failed, and what I think Riot should do should they choose to rework him into an actual Assassin. Note that if Riot wants to make him into a bruiser, I’m fine with that, but I think that if they wanted to go in that direction, they should just do a full GU like the one that Aatrox is going to get, instead of just modifying and changing his current kit.\n\nSo what’s the deal with Rengar? First of all, I want to talk about how other Assassins are balanced and countered, and how this applies to Rengar. From looking at the successful Assassins, I believe that I have divide the class into two main styles. The first style is the big outplay style. In this style, the main burst of the Assassin is heavily delayed, and often they have a lot of skillshots that can be dodged (not always). To make up for this, These Assassins have a very easy time getting to their targets, as well as a lot of mobility. Examples include Zed, Kat, and Fizz. The other type of Assassin is what I like to call a conditional Assassin. These Assassins usually have mediocre general mobility, and more difficulty getting to their targets and/or killing them in normal circumstances. However, if played in the right circumstances, or if put into the right situations, these Assassins can have incredibly fast, impossible to react damage, and incredible mobility. Assassins in this class include Kha’zix (jump resets and isolation), Talon (having to jump on walls to get to his target), and Kassadin (this one is a stretch, but his huge mana problems especially on his R lead him to being conditional). So what does this have to do with Rengar? Rengar’s kit was problematic because it had counterplay from both sides, so it had to give up a lot of the positives of both sides. His burst is delayed, but he loses the great general mobility and outplay potential that comes with it. His kill is heavily reliant on the target’s positioning, but he loses out on the incredibly fast and satisfying burst that he had. I think that part of the problem is that they didn’t go all out on either side. His burst is slow, but if he builds damage and is fed he can still kill you in under 0.25 seconds like he used to. His ult relies on targets being caught out and out of position, but that is too broad of a counterplay as that is something that you really can’t help but do sometimes, not to mention that he can track you down and find you from across the map, so that really doesn’t help with the counterplay. \n\nFor improving this design, I’d say move Rengar completely into the conditional Assassin side. Old Rengar was definitely what we’d call a conditional Assassin. He had conditional mobility in his passive when he was near brushes, and had extremely fast burst. The problem was that his ultimate lacked real counterplay so he was unhealthy. I’d say revert his Q, but make his ultimate weaker and more difficult to use, and more of an actual hunt. For a suggestion, what if Rengar had to stalk his prey, by marking the target he wanted to kill, and then having to be near them for a certain amount of time before he could jump and kill them. If Rengar got revealed while stalking his prey, his ultimate would be cancelled and he would lose his jump. Another Suggestion would be doubling down on his ferocity mechanic and making it more interactive with opponents, since it was already a condition that Rengar had to meet before being able to Assassinate his Target.\n\nAlso for the love of god if you want to make him an Assassin give him the ability to escape. I think that the CC immunity on his W was a good idea, but it had to be removed because it was already too broken that Rengar could very easily get to his target and eliminate them without much effort, he also could get out easily. But if you made his kill take more effort, I’d say that you could return the cc removal and maybe even make it stronger, as a reward for killing the target just like how k6 gets his jump resets.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nakoid","date":"2017-07-19T20:02:32.655+0000","up_votes":24,"down_votes":3,"body":"New Rengar, basically, has become more simple to play, but less fun, rewarding and fluid.

And now see him played as a hard bruiser who just go in the middle to a fight and tanky the hit is not what a rengar is mentioned to be, is not the main role for what rengar is used to be.

I climbed to master in season 5 (back when you can 1v5 with the cookie cutter 100%crit and old LW build), and slowly fell off playing until the most recent rework, after which I quit. I was actually one of the 10 members that was invited for the Rengar playtest at Riot HQ last year. I was invited based on a diamond5 smurf I had, so I don't think the Rioter in charge was aware of my level of play.  Looking back, I should've been even more assertive and adamant of my opinions, and I still regret it and feel like I did a huge disservice to the Rengar-main community. It's not like I completely pussied out and let Riot destroy the cat; believe me, I tried to voice my disliking the changes. When asked if we would continue to play the new Rengar, I was the only one who said no. Four were unsure, and five just kissed the Rioter's ass and said the new Q is way better and cooler. I talked to most of the invited playtesters, and most were plat/dia players who hadn't played in a while, and one was even a gold player who somehow got in after asking to join. The point is, this was a terrible environment to playtest anything, but one thing was absolutely clear in my mind:\n\nThe new Q was terribly bad. I was iffy about the percent healing and cc immunity (too OP?!?), and I had my doubts about the new ult (this version only allowed you to jump onto the marked target; you couldn't even jump onto minions). But after playing my first game on this new Rengar, I was sure of one thing:\n\nThe new Q sucks ass.\n\nI have been lurking in the rengarmains community ever since then, but I noticed that no one, not even the usual critics of the new Q are not taking a strong enough position against this. We need to be persistent and recognize that Riot has a reaction time of around one year. Seriously, consider dynamic queue and all the memes Riot destroyed this past year. It's expected for a company as large and inefficient as they are to be like this. The Rengar revert (or semi-revert) will be the same.\n\nLet it be known to all of you, the reworked Q is what destroyed Rengar.\n\nHow do I know this? Ask any dissatisfied Rengar main who has quit playing Rengar but still dreams about it. The vast majority of them will happily play Rengar in this current meta if simply the Q got reverted.\n\nThe reason the new Q feels so bad is because it feels like you're wielding a giant three-handed sledgehammer rather than a knife. The old Q was so deliberate and precise. I must've made over a hundred thousand auto resets with my left ring finger, and every time, it was intentional and it literally felt like I was stabbing the enemy. This new Q killed that. Everyone else has faithfully proposed changes to other aspects of Rengar's gameplay, so I will just touch up on things that they didn't address:\n\nMy proposed changes to Q, in order of worst (but still better than current Q) to best:\n\n1. Keep everything the same, but allow Rengar to walk while casting Q, and remove the half-assed dash. (Similar to Taliyah Q). This will at least make you not feel like you're stuck.\n\n2. Completely revert the Q. This is an OK option, but there are criticisms that loading all that damage into the empowered Q, especially with a 4 ferocity system will be too overloaded, and it doesn't address the lack of AoE waveclear that Rengar has in the early game.\n\n3. Revert the Q back to an auto attack modifier. Keep the empowered Q the same damage, but add a tiamat-esque (AoE) effect to it. This will keep the same deliberate stabby feeling while addressing the lack of early game waveclear.\n\n4. (POSSIBLY) Rengar auto attacks with his right hand dagger. His left hand has this wolverine claw thing. Keep the mechanics of the new Q in place, but change it so that Rengar uses his left hand claw to stab in a line straight in front of him, similar to the 2nd part of the new Q (so that you will ACTUALLY have to aim). Allow Rengar to walk while facing the direction he is casting this animation (again, similar to Taliyah Q). For example, if Rengar is walking to the left but casts Q to the right, he would face right while moving left, and damage would go to all enemies in this line of fire. If Q lands on an enemy, it will reset Rengar's auto attack cooldown timer, and the auto should hit immediately if his auto is primed onto a target. Empowered Q will be the old empowered Q with no attack speed boost. I think this will be most fun to play.\n\nThere are some other thoughts I should share:\n\nDiver vs. Assassin. I think there is too much misconception here. Rengar was classified as an assassin back when even Riot didn't have a complete grasp of how they were going to classify champions. Basically, the idea of \"diver\" didn't exist as it does now. If Rengar were released today, he would be classed primarily as a diver. In fact, in essence, Rengar was ALWAYS PRIMARILY A DIVER. A diver is someone who dives into the enemy, which is what Rengar does, even when he is assassinating someone. This sounds so obvious, but some people don't seem to understand, so I just want to make it clear so that we are all on the same page. Rengar is a diver. An assassin is someone who is able to CONSISTENTLY get away from harm even if they cannot kill their target. On the other hand, Rengar was and is and always should be someone who SHOULD die (and deserves to die) if he cannot kill his target. Rengar is a diver who is good at killing and is able to get away only when he kills all in his way. Rengar was always a diver.\n\nUltimate: The Thrill of the Hunt. Most have satisfactorily explained all that is wrong with the current ult. I just want to give one proposed idea to a change to the mechanics, which I believe will be best the best balance between fun and fair for both sides involved. Most people are arguing about how it makes no sense to add an artificial crit to Rengar's ult. It just makes it easier for no reason. I agree completely. We can extend that sentiment to the artificial stealth/camouflage that it gives to Rengar. How does that make sense? Rengar should be rewarded with the element of surprise by utilizing brush to his advantage. In fact, he should prepare for the hunt while stalking his prey from the brush. My proposal is that:\n\n1. Rengar must prepare for the hunt while he is in brush. In other words, he can only activate ult while he is in brush. For 1-3 seconds he channels his ult. When he emerges from brush, he gets a movement speed burst that quickly decays (similar to homeguards). This will punish enemies that are close to brush while giving further enemies a better chance to escape.\n\n2. Remove all the artificial stealth/camouflage. This, along with change #1 will make ult useless as a defensive maneuver, which shouldn't be allowed in the first place.\n\n3. Give Rengar heightened senses so that he is able to sense all nearby MOVING enemies by heartbeat. If they are still (aka, not moving), Rengar is unable to sense them. When Rengar is able to sense them, the enemy gets a notification. When the enemy gets a notification, he can choose to hold position (thereby removing the indicator but being unable to know if Rengar still has ult up, or he can continue to move and possibly bait Rengar into his team who is all standing still right next to him. This will allow for some very fun mind games for both sides come the mid-late game.\n\n4. There should be no global indicators. Rengar should only be able to sense his enemies if they can sense him and vice-versa (see #3)\n\nFINAL proposal: Ferocity. Rengar should be rewarded for preparing for the hunt. Ferocity should not decay. Bring it back to 5, and the problems you had before (empowered bola out of invisible cat and heavy loaded invisible burst) will not be there with my proposed ultimate and Q changes. Also with my proposed changes, you can add more utility to the bonetooth rewards. I think enough people explained why pure damage rewards are a bad mechanic.\n\nAll in all, thanks Riot for STILL choosing to work with us. It's been a long ride for everyone involved. Thanks also to the hopeful bunch who didn't give up on Rengar. I can now say that I did my part.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kattenliefhebber","date":"2017-07-19T20:07:21.107+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey guys, I'm MariusJ, and I used to be a Rengar main at heart that picked him up during the beginning of Season 6. As someone who has always being looking for that fantasy of sneaking up on an enemy champ, then going invisible and killing them in a clean way, learning and eventually mastering Rengar was a process I really enjoyed! Sadly, I've not really touched him after his rework.\n\nWhat is your criticism of the current state of Rengar?\n\nMy criticism with rengar as he is now is a bit simple. The entire 'hunter' feel and fantasy is gone, with Rengar changed from an assassin with bruiser-like capabilites to a bruiser with assassin-capabilities. I used to love being able to ult in when being ahead, feeling an actual 'thrill' when jumping on the enemy, so to speak. However, with the changes to his R (mainly the huge radius from which an enemy can see you approaching) this fantasy is gone. Add to this that the Q can't be used to cancel an AA anymore, and suddenly I found myself rapidly losing interest in the champion i happily played 300 games with.\n\nWhat do you want Rengar's gameplay fantasy to be?\n\nThe main fantasy should be that when a fed Rengar uses his ult, the players should get the feeling that they're actually hunting a champion, and that when the champion knows they're being hunted, it'll almost too late. (unless the champion has a control ward between Rengar and him/herself, ofcourse. )\n\nWhat changes would you suggest to Rengar?\n\nHonestly, I would love to see the old Q being back in place. Having a true AA cancel felt like a good way to express skill, even if not as obvious to the majority to the community. Rengar's W is currently just an ability used to get to max ferocity quickly, but I have no idea what changes could be made to this that would fit Rengar and still be useful to him in a different way. Rengar's Bola strike has always been an ability that fitted his kit quite well, and apart from a few bugs, still does. As for his ultimate ability, I think the only things really needing a change is the range from which enemies knows they're being hunted, and putting the power of the crit into something else.\n\nThat should about sum up everything when I think about Knifecat","replies":[]},{"poster":"A Jolly Jay","date":"2017-07-19T20:51:05.809+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":1,"body":"**Change of playstyle and why it fails to capture his fantasy**\n\nFollow me on this.\nRengar, old Rengar, was all about one thing.\nPicks.\n\nIt would be all you were useful for as assassin Rengar.

Always have that before looking for a pick.\n2. You are useless when your ult is down, stack that CDR.\n3. Pick out the most vulnerable member on the enemy team to start the snowballing.\n4.

Remove one and Rengar is useless.**\n\nWith the rework, Rengar got a few changes.\n\n1. Leaps have a consistent 725 range.\n2. Your ult has the same cooldown at all levels.\n3. You gain 1 ferocity when leaping at 0 ferocity.\n4. Ferocity decaying when out of combat. (Straight to 0)\n\nRengar is riddled with the problems of his old kit, an overreliance on ult to be useful. \nAnd that CAN be fine. A lot of champions have that “Problem” aswell. (Sejuani and Amumu coming to mind.)\nThe problem is that how you’re very cooldown based on your picks with it being the only reliable one you got.\n\nAnd if you can’t reliably assassinate, you can’t do your job. Thats binary gameplay, ones and zeros.\nWhere you only have ONE job and only have two outcomes.\n\n**\"If the ult was so easy as you put it, what made a good Rengar good?\"**\n\nLet me put it this way;\n\nAsk any Rengar main worth their salt and they will have 3 things to say.\nNightblu3 is a shitty Rengar main.\nOneshot montages are fucking boring.\nToplane Rengar mains are the hardcore mains.\n\nAnd so you come to my own opinion, what seperates the good Rengar mains from the decent ones?\n\nHow you manage to be useful even with the lack of your ult.\nThose were the best Rengar mains.\nNightblu3 was top percentage reliant on his ult to be useful, making him a bad Rengar main in my eyes.\nEvery oneshot montage starts always in their ultimate.\nToplane Rengar mains are forced to interact with people during a time when they don’t have their ultimate yet, when they can be the most vulnerable. (That doesn’t excuse the lvl 2 cheeses and stuff like that though.)\n\n---\n\nIn the end, it all loops back around to the ultimate.\nThe changes didn’t “Remove” the playstyle, but I would say that it tries really damn hard to stop you from using that playstyle on him.\n\nThere are definitely a lot of other problems I have with the rework but those problems I can live with for the fact that what should matter with any kind of art or enjoyment should be how fun it is as a whole, or in simpler terms;\nDoes the pros outweigh the cons?\n\nPossible solutions;\n\nReplace the ult with other methods for hunting.\nAllow Rengar the playstyle of the old and cut the stealth or vision instead.\n\nThe ult has to either go and replaced with other hunting tools to allow different pick methods which Rengar will have to work harder for.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#Methods for a nice list to start from and get inspired from.\nOr you change the ultimate yet again to allow such playstyles that the old one reveled in.\nPersonally speaking though, I would just prefer if Rengar was built from the ground and up with an entirely different kit with the playstyle of the old.\n\nPicks.\nMany different ways to gain a pick.\nFor a great analogy; Imagine the torture scene in GTA 5.\nImagine old Rengar only having a hammer to work with.\nWhat I would love to see would be to have more tools than just the hammer.\nI would like a saw.\nNails.\nA dildo.\nAnd so forth.

However, I believe there were some additions that should be considered and possibly improved upon. The idea of forcing players to think on the fly and select an empowered ability based on the situation would increase the variability in Rengar's gameplay and even if it didn't work out as intended within this rework, I still believe requiring players to make that split-second decision before acting would be an interesting feature to possibly look into once again. \n\n\n\n>**Ideal Rengar**\n\n\nAn ideal Rengar to me would feel more like an assassin and less like a tank/bruiser; Being smooth to play and relying more on positioning rather than a clunky, brute force playstyle. Previous combos on Rengar felt very fluid and were fun to practice and perform in game. Everything you could do on him felt so smooth and fast as opposed to the current clunky and powerful feel. As an assassin, I believe he should be required to position properly and time his engages perfectly, to where the slightest misstep results in his own death, while a perfectly timed jump from stealth/brush allows him to burst an unprepared target.\n\n\n\n>**Possible Changes to Consider**\n\n\nA couple suggestions I would like to see include: Fast and Smooth instead of Clunky and Powerful, Positioning & Timing instead of Engaging whenever and tanking + healing the dmg, Split-second decisions with regard to empowered abilities, keep the brush mechanics, Q as a real AA reset (Like the old one), W benefitting an assassin playstyle rather than restricting it, R indicator appearing only after fully stealthed, and finally, a reconsideration of the ferocity bar (See Below).\n\nThe previous ferocity system (5 ferocity, doesn't deplete out of combat) added an element to Rengar's gameplay which helped separate the good Rengars from the rest of the pack. Being able to adjust your route, and clearing camps in a way that would enable the player to set up a gank with 4 or 5 ferocity was a puzzle that made Rengar so unique. However,with that 5 ferocity system, came the oppressive top-lane Rengar, where a player could hold the 5 ferocity and zone most other champions fairly effortlessly. I personally lean more towards the old ferocity system, although the top-lane oppression is something that would absolutely need to be considered.\n\nThanks for taking the time to read through all these comments, and I look forward to hopefully seeing Rengar in a different state in the future!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Overwhelmi","date":"2017-07-19T20:46:55.803+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"He's now an olympic swimmer.\n\nFantasy would be a trophy hunter, the pridestalker we all knew and loved. \n\nPassive: \n\nBonetooth necklace: get rid of ad scaling, give back unique utility rewards.\nLeap: Remove leap delay, speed it up (clunky)\n\nq: Revert\n\nw: Remove and replace with a damage oriented spell.

He was the champion that made me finally \"get\" the game, and he was the champion that my IRL friends, even if they were higher rank, couldn't match me at (i played a looooot of customs to witness that) because of my sheer knowledge of the champion. Auto resets, jump resets, double jumps, jump combos, drive-by bolas and ferocity management.\nPretty much EVERY build worked with him (on-hit, AD, armor pen, bruiser, crit, AP, TriForceZhonya's, tank) and you could comfortably first pick him into something like a Rek'Sai because who knows, you might go tank Rengar.\n\nFirst let's go over my feelings regarding Old Rengar.\n\nBONETOOTH NECKLACE: It was a neat little unique trinket (later turned passive) that pretty much defined Rengar as this \"selfish\" champion, who wants all the glory to himself. It wasn't too problematic and the bonuses came at often the right times. If the enemy players overextended or otherwise were dumb enough, you could stack it on them, but it took a while because it was gated for every 3-6 trophies. That is only a minor issue though (that can be fixed with proper play), and every champion has at least some issues.\n\nPASSIVE: The leap is the defining aspect of Rengar and even RIOT knows this. I prefer starting with a smaller leap and having to build my \"cred\" to get a bigger, better stronger leap (besides laning against current leap which is 6 trophy leap early game is oppressive).\nYou could do many wacky combos with the leap, but RIOT made it so he can cast only one spell during the leap on New! Rengar.\nThe cast time post 6.2 is a major issue as well.\n\nFEROCITY: Easily one of the best parts of Rengar as well. Having to preparate the \"hunt\" was a really cool thing. Ferocity management introduced a lot of combos or potential outplays, and it opened a whole new realm for decision making.\n\nQ: Nice meme. This ability was sooo satisfying and addicting to use, it had a ton of play around it (so much for a simple auto reset) due to Rengar's passive, ferocity, and a couple of wacky combos. Post 6.2 Empowered Q pretty much perfected the vision of a Diver/Assassin \"Pick your Playstyle\" type of champion.\n\nW: Some people hated this ability, i simply like it because it flows well with his kit/theme (roaring, increasing your defenses, hence not giving up on tough prey). You can use W while Qing or leaping, and the ability just feels \"right\" to use. The armor/MR made Rengar deceptively tanky and the heal was a nice thing to have as well, although it wasn't that much, you could use it to sustain lane. It was also pretty fun to use W as AP Rengar. It's not that much reactive since you just pop it for the ferocity and for maximum fight potential (Rengar forcing a fight on you, he popped his W, will you attack him, knowing he has a state of higher defenses? You will you wait it out and punish him?). It's simple, and it works, that's what matters.\n\nE: Bola strike. I'm soooorry, i just had to say it. This ability is pretty much fine, the cast time ruined it though.\n\nR: Oh boy, the controversial, the \"Press R to kill\" many ADC's complained about. Look, this ability post 6.2 was completely FINE (the indicator was slightly longer that i would like to be but fine). It's what a good indicator should be. (it kinda fucked up early&lane ganks with the nerf but oh well we popped it later) There was a very crucial mechanic RIOT didn't fix though. When Rengar ulted in a place you didn't have vision, his indicator wouldn't pop until he was close to you. FIxing this would fix most of the complaints. The vision made Rengar useful out of SoloQ and in the hands of a good player potentially very deadly. Remember all those Rengars who ulted out of nowhere into the jungle? That's what we called, a Rengar's \"predator sense\", so to speak.\n\nAight, heres my thoughts on NEW RENGAR:\n\nBONETOOTH: Doesn't feel that much rewarding (i killed my lane opponent, i got 1+1% AD, wow!) and the concept is very unoriginal, ironically making Rengar even more feast and famine (3 stacks or you are useless)\n\nPassive: Completely busted in Top Lane due to it's increased range. Reason for this was \"muh inconsistency\", but why have Kindred & Kog'Maw run around then?\n\nFEROCITY: 4 stacks, Passive decay, free stack on leap. No longer has to hit enemies for ferocity. Aside from this new ferocity taking much of his decision making out, it just encourages mindless ability spamming (we'll get onto that later) due to the 4 stacks. Being able to go from 0 to full ferocity in one leap shouldn't be possible. He can't \"prep\" for the hunt as well, and he has took a great toll in pre-6 ganks due to it and post-6 ganks as well (we'll get onto that later.)\n\nQ: This is what a nice meme is. Your autos do more damage than this ability. This ability locks you out of doing anything, casting it during leap locks you out of E and the best thing is, it isn't even casted during leap (rather, towards the end), the ability doesn't fit Rengar that much (guy looks like he's swimming) and the sound is just...eh? The low CD promotes spammability (even if you don't hit anything or do no  damage) for the best ability Rengar has in his kit...\n\nW: ...this ability disgusts me. It went from a pretty good ability to this abomination. You know the normal behaviour for a teamfight? You zone with your ult. pressuring the enemy to clump, jump and spam W to heal a shit ton (like ~128% of the damage you just took) and bait their key abilities with your cleanse. This ability just encourages mindless spamming of your Q so you can spam W.\n\nE: Still has the buggy and clunky cast time. No longer having Old Ferocity locks you out of ganks pre-6 and what would be guaranteed kills post-6.\n\nR: Thrill of the Zone. This ability lasts too long, has a pointless 2 second lock (the enemies are warned during it as well) and a glorious huge indicator. (did i mention the indicator SCALES with your ult rank?) I personally preferred the !, felt way more iconic and a lil' bit MGS-y.\nThe crit artificially gates his power budget, and blindly focusing on the target nearest to you and warning them from miles away instead of calmly analysing the situation, waiting for the right to make a move and pick your target feels more like a Warwick ability than a Rengar one.\n\nLook, i never really cared about \"my oneshots\", several champions can oneshot and i don't play them as much as i played old Rengar (see Nocturne, guy can pretty much oneshot with only Warrior or Duskblade, provided you have Lethality runes, and it's telegraphed like old Rengar ult, so it's fair), but this new Rengar just feels **WRONG** to play. I feel like i'm countering myself by using ultimate, i feel like i'm countering myself by using Q, everybody can counter Rengar, but Rengar can't counter anybody. Rengar lost his identity of a DPSy fighter with a special element to the mix (combos, stealth, trophies) who could pick his own playstyle (a bursty assassin with proper combo'ing who has no escapes, or a tenacious fighter who keeps dishing it out and splitpushing?), he did Kayn's job waaaaaay better (see the introduction and his variety of builds). He's no longer this Magikarp who is useless pre-6 in ganking but spiked super hard with level 6.\nHis ganks legit feel like praying the enemy overextends like a mad man.\n\nOld Rengar had a very unique playstyle for (most) people who built him full AD/crit. He didn't have any escapes (one of the most defining aspects of playing Full AD Rengar and why i think forcing W into an overpowered escape is something bad) but he shined in duels with his EmpQ and his W, but he could also burst with proper combo'ing because, well, you know, he's glass cannon.\nIf Rengar suddenly turned into Rambo and just ulted straight forth into the enemy team, they would clump/pop sweepers once they saw the ! and he would jump and die (if he was like 14/4 while building crit, he would take somebody with him) which obviously isn't the best decision.\nSo how did he deal with this? He played like a scavenger, waiting for the right moment, camping in a bush, waiting for somebody to facecheck it...BOOM. Or he pushed out a lane to bait some unsuspecting target into farming the pushed wave, and either kill him in lane or between rotations, or force a teamfight. Or if the enemy team for some reason is low HP and blew all their CC skills (for some reason), he could act as cleanup crew.\nIf he really needed to, he could participate on head-on 5v5 teamfights, but he needed to not only wait out for most of the fight to happen, he needed to position his ult correctly (if you ulted from the enemy team's back that would be unexpected, so their reaction would be delayed) to thrive in a potentially dangerous enviroment and pray to god nobody CC's him and that he can flash out.\nHe always strayed away from his team, waiting for people to take the baits he setup.\n\nIt's like reworking Riven and removing her animation cancels, but giving her some really bullshit spells to aid her in fighting.\nYeah, sure, she can't pull the animation cancels skilled Riven's do and she's now P/B in the LCS, but is it worth it? That character is just a hollow husk and a generic bruiser now. Same thing happened with Rengar.\n\n--HOW TO FIX RENGAR?--\nThe less time consuming and effective option that would surely make most of the Rengar players happy (including me) is to revert him with a few QoL changes. Turning his ult into camo, adding some extra armor values and maybe a W fear on monsters so he could clear today's jungle, removing cast time on E, and using the post 6.2 EmpQ numbers which pretty much solidified this healthy divide between bruiser, assassin Rengar or whatever Rengar you want to play, (Post 6.2 Rengar couldn't oneshot unless he was massively fed) and fixing the ult mechanic discussed above.\n\nSlightly tuning down the indicator would be a helpful change since his ult is now camo and stuff.

Why? Because the main objective of the rework was to offer counterplay and remove the oneshot combo, but rengar can still one shot and the couterplay to him is the EXACT SAME as it was before the rework: stay close to your support and/or team and buy pinks to spot him while he's camouflaged.  But now, rengar  has a reliable escape in his W  after he oneshots which is something he did not have before and that makes him harder to balance. Riot basically made rengar harder to balance, easier to play and made him clunky and not fun to play AT ALL. I'd say 95% of old rengar mains agree with me about that.\n\nPassive: The new ferocity system does not make sense and does not belong in an assassin's kit, because it requires you to stay in combat long enough to get your empowered ability. Asssassins want to get in the fight, kill the carry as fast as possible and get out and that's why I personally think the old ferocity system was fine.\n\nQ: The new Savagery does not feel good at all, it is extremely clunky and does not interact well with his kit at all due to the delay on it, the only time it interacts well with his kit his when rengar jumps out of ult and Qs. To make rengar enjoyable again, I suggest you revert the Q and make it a smooth AA reset again and if it's too OP, make it so it can't crit.\n\nW: The new W makes rengar extremely strong if you build him as bruiser (which should not happen), because you are able to jump in, tank a sh*t ton of damage and heal for all of the damage you took (i've had a lot of games where it went up to 1.5k hp) and in my opinion that's really toxic, it's also stronger than the old W because it also removes CC now which makes rengar stronger and again, harder to balance.\n\nE: This ability is great and doesn't need any changes.\n\nR: If you were to revert rengar, I think leaving the current ultimate (remove the guaranteed crit) would be fine, because it makes rengar more predictable and easier to counterplay, which was the main objective of this rework.\n\nA lot of rengar mains will tell you this, we do not care about one shotting, we just want a fluid, smooth rengar that is fun to play and doesn't feel clunky.\n\n\nThanks for reading :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zétanta","date":"2017-07-19T20:36:13.664+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello folks,\n\nI wanted to write my own thoughts and rework ideas on Rengar for a long time now, but I never really had the time to do it actually. But since this megathread opened now I think this is be the best time to do it, so without further ado, let's get started.\n\nFerocity Passive\n\nI always thought from the moment Rengar's rework got released that the losing ferocity mechanic is a very bad idea, not only that it limits Rengar's kit and takes some fun out of it. There are actually Champions with a similar kind of passive, which can keep their stacks without losing them. (It's Annie btw.) Stacking Rengars passive was actually a part of Rengars kit that made really fun. It also raised his skillceiling since you had to manage your ferocity and couldn't just spam your abilities all the time when you took damage or dealt damage just to get to your empowered ability, which too, let's Rengar AND the player look pretty dumb imo, since you're just smashing buttons like a braindead lol.(Sorry for my language but it's the truth) The old ferocity system actually REWARDED you for hitting your abilities, mostly your Bola, for example if your team got sieged at a tower and your ult was down. The new one does not reward you, it punishes you without any compensation, it gives you a specific time and if this time runs out, you lose everything, for example if your enemy runs away and only turns around after your ferocity just vanished and you die only because of that, which is frustrating, and the fact that there is absolutly no compensation whatsoever for losing a full ferocity passive just makes it more frustrating. Ofc you could use your empowered bola but then you're at 0 ferocity again and probably die, or you can use your empowered W but the only thing you gain from that is bonus movementspeed for 1,5 seconds, the old W healed you at least for a small amount. (Overall Rengars complete rework is just rushed and not really thought out, but more to this later when I talk about all the other abilities) There is also the fact that Riot tried to nerf Rengars ferocity passive, which could have been done on so many other ways. Instead of lowering Rengars passive stacks, they could have been increased to 6 or 7 which dont disappear out of combat. This would have been a decent nerf too for Rengar, but lowering it to 4 also encouraged people to build bruiser/tanky like, cause you could get your full ferocity much quicker due to fewer stacks needed, and the tankier you are, the more empowered abilities you can cast, plus your passive already gives you flat bonus AD and % bonus AD. Then there was the possibility to let Rengar lose his stacks upon activating his ult, which also could have been compensated with giving Rengars ult some more utility like movementspeed or enemys Rengar can see depending on how many stacks Rengar had before ulting.\n\nWell whatever, my changes would look like this:\n\nRengar generates 1 Ferocity upon damaging an enemy with an ability. Upon reaching 6 Ferocity, Rengars next basic ability is empowered, can be cast independently of it's basic version's cooldown, incurs no cooldown of it's own and consumes all Ferocity.\nAfter casting an empowered ability, Rengar does not gain movementspeed.\n\nLets's move over to his:\n\nBonetooth Necklace\n\nRengar's old Bonetooth Necklace actually gave him much needed utility, which he doesn't have anymore, instead it gives you flat bonus AD and % bonus AD, the first 2 stacks beeing completely useless and totally unrewarding, which, again, makes Rengar frustrating to play. There are a total of 5 stacks, every stack could have had the same amount of AD, making it fairer for the player, but no, the first one gives 1 AD plus 1% bonus AD, even the mastery Natural Talent gives more AD at level 1 than Rengars passive, you get 2,44 bonus AD at level 1. Thats just ridiculous, not to mention that his passive overall is imaginativeless and cries for a rework. Rengar didn't have an escape tool like other assassin's have. He only has engage tools but Rengar was still considered more an assassin than a bruiser. Imo Rengar was something inbetween, not a full assassin but also not a full bruiser, which is totally okay, there is nothing wrong with that, as long as he is a fun, fluent to play and fairly balanced , and Rengar was indeed more balanced pre-rework than he is now. Riot changed his leap range from 600 to 725 from lvl 1 and made it so it doesn't change, with the justification that other players should accustom to his leap range. But now Rengar has a higher leap range at lvl 1 than he had before, which means that enemys who couldn't memorise his leap range and got attacked pre-rework, are now guaranteed to get jumped on by Rengar more than ever, which doesn't make sense. Especially when, after his rework, they release reworked Warwick who has a much more altering leap range with his ult than Rengar had pre-rework and then they also updated Kindred and gave her a changing AA range depending on her stacks. To give Rengars Bonetooth Necklace more fun and versatility, I would change his stacking system, currently there are 5 stacks for every unique enemy. Its kind of better than before but still, it lacks fun, versatility and also encourages you to take the kill instead of giving it to your laner, because you get a small timewindow of 1,5 seconds where you have to damage the dieing champion to get a stack, and mostly it ends in the Rengarplayer killing the enemy or not getting a stack at all, which again, makes him frustrating to play. (wow so many frustrations)\n\nWhat I would do is let Rengar have 10 or 15 stacks in total(upon debate), every opponent can give Rengar 2 or 3 stacks in total(upon debate). Rengar just needs to get a kill or assist on that champion to get 1 stack. Also, the last 2 champions Rengar has killed can't give him stacks. That prevents Rengar from ganking botlane over and over again 2 or 3 times to get all the stacks from that lane and killing the weakest champion over and over again. Now to his Bonetooth stacks, instead of bonus AD, Rengar should get utility like his old one which he highly needs since hes neither full assassin nor full bruiser. My changes would look something like this:\n\nAt 2(or 3) stacks: Unseen Predator gains 125 bonus leap range, increasing to 725 from 600 and Rengar gains 15 movement speed in bush. \nAt 4(or 6) stacks: After leaping from his ult or a bush, Rengar gains additional 10% bonus movement speed for 1 second and gainst 10 out of combat movement speed. \nAt 6(or 9) stacks: If Thrill of the Hunt is active and Rengar is in the jungle or bush, he is invisible, everywhere else he is camouflaged. (Lane, Base, River) \nAt 8(or 12) stacks: Thrill of the Hunt's duration is increased by 5 seconds and shroud time is decreased by 1 second, also if Rengar is in a bush while ulting, he has no shroud time. \nAt 10(or 15) stacks: When Thrill of the Hund is active, Rengar gains true sight of all enemies in his ult range and gains additional 20% bonus movement speed.\n\nQ- Savagery\n\nI don't think I have to talk much about this ability at all since almost the whole Rengar community hates this ability and knows that it's really bad and clunky.\n\nA basic revert to his old Q would be my solution with the attack speed steroid since his old Q was a really fun ability to use which too, got taken from him. (That's also a reason why he's not nearly as fun to play as before)\n\nOf course with some number changes, since League of Legends changed a lot with items, jungle and champions. It would also be a nerf for Rengar getting his Q back because his first jungle clears will suffer definitely, making his ganks weaker and giving him a weaker early game. I'm not just here for buffs, some changes will also nerf Rengar. I just want to make my Rengar fun to play again and remove the frustrating, clunky, current Rengar.\n\nW- Battle Roar\n\nNow this ability is, like his passive leap range, contradictory. Riot justified changing this ability with the reason, that this ability is not an assassin ability, more a bruiser-like ability. Then they changed it into an even MORE bruiser-like abilty. Which again, reflects that this rework was rushed. I already said that Rengar was never 100% assassin, nor 100% bruiser and I was actually fine with this ability. It gave you something to play around by hitting multiple enemys and gaining more from it and also a much needed sustain in the jungle, and since the current jungle is harder than the one in season 6, I definitely prefer the heal part of his empowered W. His basic W could be also a revert, giving armor and magic resistance or something like a % damage reduction on yourself or enemys in the area hit by Battle Roar deal a % amount less damage, I could also imagine that he get's a resistance against slows. These options would make sense since his ability is a Roar and should intimidate others or give him more sustain. The current W just asks for a bruiser/tank build with Spirit Visage and double W healing for 130% of the damage taken. It's an unhealthy ability and too, not really thought through.\n\nE-Bola Strike\n\nThis ability is actually fine with some number and bug changes ofc.\n\nR- Thrill of the Hunt\n\nNow this ability could have been nerfed on so many other ways making it both healthier for the enemy and also healthy for Rengar. All this ability currently does is being super healthy for the enemy player and super unhealthy for the Rengar player. First off you have a shroud time, which is ok. But during this shroud time, you can't jump or do anyting and the enemy already has your eyes above his head knowing you pressed R. This is actually a really big problem and needs to be changed. Then there is the fact that you can only see the nearest enemy and he has also your eyes above his head. This way your ult is actually one of the easiest abilities to counter. First off switch positions with a tank, now Rengar can't see his real target and everyone knows where Rengar is, making this ability almost useless, plus the guaranteed crit build in your R is also useless.","replies":[{"poster":"Zétanta","date":"2017-07-19T20:36:37.841+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Compare Rengar's R to Twitch's Q, it's ridiculous. Twitch can camouflage himself and walk around without alerting anyone, while everyone knows exactly that Rengar pressed R and from which direction he is coming from. This just cries out loud that this ability was made this way so that nobody can get caught by Rengar anymore, thus no more cryposts on the boards. You, as the Rengar player, are literally playing against your own kit with these abilities. Twitch's Q has almost the same duration, a 16 second cooldown (Rengar 150/110/70 seconds), 10% bonus movement speed and up to 50% bonus attack speed. Just ridiculous. And since he builds crit items his attacks will crit anyway.\n\nRiot could have balanced this abilty at least in these 2 ways:\n\nEither make his stealth a camouflage and keep the part that Rengar gets true sight of everyone in range, also giving everyone the mark over their heads.\n\nOr keep his invisibility and let only the neares 2 or 3 champions get that mark over their heads.\n\nBoth options would have been a nerf to his ult and would have given the enemy tools to play around his ult without his R beeing too unhealthy for Rengar himself. Now what they did is make his stealth camouflage and let him only see his nearest enemy, who also gets the mark. And an build in crit which is unhealthy and/or useless. This is a massive nerf to Rengars R, which makes it only a bit usefull for scouting. That's it. There's nothing more to this ability, except the fact that his ult indicator range is HUGE. Making it very hard for the Rengar player to catch someone and very easy for the enemy to get away...\n\nSo my proposal would be:\n\nRengar channels his predatory instincts, becoming stealthed after 3 seconds and gaining true sight of the nearest 3 enemies within his range. (with 5th passive stack all 5 enemies within his range) Every enemy within a range of 1600 gets a mark over his head (after shroud time!) While Thrill of the Hunt is active, Rengar gains additional 20% bonus movement speed while walking towards an enemy champion. After Thrill of the Hunt has ended, Rengar gains 25%/35%/45% additional movementspeed (with 2nd passive stack 35%/45%/55% for one second, only when leapt) True sight radius 2000/3000/4000 Camouflage duration 8/10/12 seconds (with passive stack 13/15/17 seconds) After ulting, Rengar can jump on an enemy within range, after 1 second shroud time is over. Casting most spells ends Thrill of the Hunt, however, placing a pinkward does not end it.\n\nThese are my proposed changes for Rengar, they are not some sloppy ideas, I really thought them through. I really want Rengar to live his Hunter/Predator style lore. Beeing very mobile in the jungle, beeing very quick, running around, dodging enemies and beeing this squishy, slippery cat in the jungle. Cause he does not really have an disengage tool in his kit, therefore he needs build in movementspeed steroids to change positions and dodge abilities and immediately vanishing, running away after successfully assassinating someone. Other assassins have their own tools (Khazix E reset, Talon E, Katarina E etc. you get what I mean) Rengar should get movementspeed buffs in his kit so he can get away too.\n\nNow I wanted to compare Rengar to a few other champions, if you're interested you can still read it, it doesn't have much to do with the changes on Rengar I mentioned above. What I wanted to talk about was this \"one shot\" story everyone keeps bringing up and yelling: \"How is this Rengar even allowed in League of Legends!\" Well, first off Rengar could only really oneshot when ahead, and most of the people who cried about Rengar beeing OP were splitpush ADC's who were behind and pushed out too far from their tower, not thinking about Rengar. Of course he is going to oneshot you if you are far behind and 3 levels under him, but so would everyone else who is ahead, even tanks can do that. I myself played Rengar for a long time and loved his high skillceiling, thats why I put so much time and work into this champion to master him, for what? To watch him die now in a corner? Nerfed to death and being absolutely no fun to play anymore? No, I didn't put so much work into this champion to do that. And because I played him for such a long time, I know exactly why these people get oneshotted and what kind of players they are. You guys probably know what I'm talking about, I don't even need to tell you.\n\nNow, let's get some Champions other than Rengar who can oneshot and even have abilities much harder to dodge or outplay than Rengars R.\n\nLet's look at Nocturne's R\n\nHis R let's everyone become nearsighted, he can ult to someone in range IMMEDIATELY and oneshot him much quicker than Rengar can, if we take the time Rengar needs to walk to his opponent into account, and the enemy does not get a notification that he's coming for you. How is this different from Rengar?\n\nLet's assume Twisted Fate is ahead in level and items, he can ult and stun+burst an enemy ADC farming alone in botlane down just as quick. How is this different from Rengar?\n\nLet's take Akali who is also ahead, enemy ADC dies within a blink of an eye. How is this different?\n\nZed doesn't even need to ult, just a full rotation of his Q W E on the ADC who is far behind him and he's is dead.\n\nI could continue with this list but there is no need, everyone of you who is reading this knows at least a few other champions who can do EXACTLY the same. You know what I'm talking about. I'm not complaining about these champions that they're OP and should get nerfed or something, no. All I'm saying is, if they can do these things and have such abilities, then stop complaining about Rengar beeing sooooo OP. He's not. There were actually a lot of matchups I couldn't pick Rengar because the enemy teamcomp would have murdered me, or where I regretted picking Rengar as firstpick. He was fairly balanced, a few tweaks here and there would have been totally enough. There was absolutely no need for a rework. Only these players on the Boards riotting about Rengar led to this rushed and failed rework...\n\nJust my two cents. I would appreciate constructive replies about my ideas, and your own opinions.

Rengar has always been able to one shot an AD carry, but now it's simply not fun. If rengar is a character who is so unhealthy because of his one shot potential, then why does he still have that same potential after the rework? Because that's what Rengar is meant to do, kill one target and then either die or MAYBE escape. However, this is no longer fun to do based on the way he was reworked. His new passive requires absolutely no management of his ferocity bar, any player can spam abilities and one shot someone if they are ahead. Pre-rework, you at least had to have some knowledge and understanding of the champion to properly utilize his passive. \n\nAdditionally, the Q is now tremendously out of the range of Rengar's intended purpose when he was first created. Because this ability now deals damage in an AOE cone, he can potential kill more champions than he would pre-rework when he goes all in during an engagement. This is problematic not only because the Q is insanely annoying to deal with as an enemy player when ahead but it's not fun to use. The Q is a boring ability, it doesn't feel good to activate and doesn't flow with how an assassin should play (it feels more like a fighter's ability). The best thing you could do for this ability is revert it, it simply must not stay in it's current state if rengar wishes to be a fluid champion with a solid understood set of playstyles.\n\nEven more so, his W also feels like rengar is somehow being cheesed by his own kit and tricked into thinking he is some sort of fighter. The new W encourages rengar to dive into risky situations and gives rengar players a false sense of security when using it. It doesn't fit his kit at all, it doesn't provide anything of relevance to his kit other than in the jungle or in laning phase. This ability could theoretically stay the same if the way healing is applied changes. To make this ability more balanced, the heal needs to actually give some sort of sustain. When Rengar has not taken damage, this ability should heal him for a relatively small amount. This gives him a bit of sustain in jungle and his desperately needed sustain i top lan e.\n\nBut oh god...the ultimate, this is the definition of cheese. This ability is a gimmick at it's core, it should not crit and at the same time it should not alert the player who is closest to him, nor should it have a 2 second windup. This ability has been gutted. This ability should likely have it's 2 second windup removed as well as the stealth effect. Give this character much more movespeed when using Thrill of the hunt and make it so that the ability notification is not given directly to the target he is nearest to.\n\nThis champion still 1 shots champions in a way that is more unhealthy than what was previously seen on his pre-rework form and is at the same time lower skill cap and less fun to play. I have loved this champion for years and he has been my main for a long time. I deeply hope that riot will see that the people who played him in the past loved him and that we are tired of being treated poorly. \n\nThe Rengar community wishes only to have their champion back and we are getting very tired of the MANY rude comments that we have gotten in the past from rioters. We have tried and will continue to remain cordial, but we do want some respect and we wish for our thoughts to be taken into consideration.

No, not at all. \nIt should however not completely counter Rengar in every way possible, \nSo, I suggest his ult no longer reveals his position. \n\nOR revert to old indicator BUT instead when Rengar ults, it can do a global sound (like Sion but a huge roar instead!) so you know he has ulted and can react, this version will however still reveal his position once he's in old indicator range.\n\nIn exchange for this i'd remove the crit on ult!\n\nI believe Rengar's playstyle almost solely lies in his ultimate. If he's to be an assassin/hunter again, his ult needs to allow him to hunt. Right now he doesn't at all feel like a hunter.

TLDR Most aspects of current rengar and ill answer those in the 3rd question.\n\n2)\tWhat do you want Rengar’s gameplay fantasy to be ?\n\nSimply put , Rengar is this ferocious Ruthless predator that likes fighting stronger foes than him and hunting them down to collect their heads , he is this relentless predator that just wants to kill stronger enemies , and that’s whats his current is completely neglecting , that is why some parts of his old kit made him so fun to play and so unique in terms of gameplay even if his kit was toxic BECAUSE of the numbers and the mechanics his kit interractions had (permanent ferocity after ulting , high Q base dmg/numbers , invisibility R , 5 Ferocity after jumping from R) this is why I have some suggestions that include some parts of his old kit (Q , the concept of old bonetooth) while maintaining counterplay and also forcing rengar to PLAY EXTREMLY WELL in order to be effective.\n\n3)\tWhat Changes would you suggest to rengar ?\n\n+Lets start with the passive: \n\nUnseen predator: The Range must go back to the old one since the *tuned* bonetooth will affect his range at a certain stack.\n\nBonetooth Necklace :  Has the same amount of stacks as it does now , but offers different bonuses and not raw damage (im not going to mention them all since I’d like to leave the experimenting to you guys if your taking this in consideration) though the range increase should be at stack N4 since it is necessary , and just to make it clear , his bonetooth must have UTILITY bonuses only AND not one single damage buff since it could make his kit stronger than it is now.\n\nFerocity :  back to being permanent and 5 stacks , the only difference here is , it will have a special interractions with R to make his burst dmg after jumping WAYYY less frustrating than his old kit.\n\nQ:  Partial revert , is an auto enhancer and reset again , instead of it being a pre-usable ability (meaning you can Q before jumping) it’s a targetable ability instead similar to camille’s or kha’zix Q , this is to prevent INSTANT burst and give counterplay to people when rengar jumps at them , ALSO number wise his emp Q dmg based level should be HEAVILY tuned , and the attack speed MUST BUT either reduced or removed if necessary , again to tone down critgar’s effectiveness and burst damage to make him reasonable to play against. ALSO , one more important thing , no longer grants 20% bonus dmg and if this ability is still toxic , the crit dmg on it could be modified to deal reduced dmg like yasuo/jhin’s autos. Experimenting is a must.\n\nW:  not sure what to say about this ability , although healing dmg is not something that an assassin would want , this is why I had this idea in mind since its called “BATTLE ROAR” I was thinking something like % increased dmg for a certain duration something like (1%/2%/4%/6%/10% for 2/2.5/3/3.5/4 based on level) this would make his dueling slightly powerful but also not too frustrating , as for his empowered W it should have healing based of missing hp (again number adjustments are a must here) but also grants 15% increased dmg for the same duration as normal W based on rank.\n\nE:  no need for changes unless there was something necessary , maybe base dmg reduction / ratio increase other than that its perfect as it is atm.\n\nR: I was thinking since rengar has this bar similar to kindred’s , it should have 2 monitors on it , 5 dots (either red/green , red for no stacks and green for successful stack) and the normal champion portraits where you would have to mark your target to UNLOCK your ultimate in order to make use of it , also his R is STILL camouflage , when you press R , the target that you marked hear you ulting from wherever you currently are as long as you press R , also they do get a small marker above their head if rengar is close enough , AND on top of that there is a new system that would allow the marked target know HOW CLOSE rengar currently is , and this is where the heartbeat system comes in , the closer rengar is to the marked target this is ofc to make rengar’s target know where is coming from , also whenever rengar uses his ultimate , he LOSES ALL OF HIS CURRENT STACKS , this is very important ,but in return he gets 5 stacks ferocity generation back to compensate.\n\n\nTLDR : I know that my suggestion isn’t the best among many others , but it’s a good place to start , hopefully these are going to be taken in consideration by riot because I can safely say that most if not ALL rengar players are REALLY unsatisfied with rengar’s current state.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GinoSoldier","date":"2017-07-19T21:31:35.438+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sona mid main here to chip in!\n\nI'll be straightforward, i don't know the in-depth details of Rengar's playstyle, but one thing's sure, if i'm not scared of the cat, something's odd.\n\nI mostly want to say; I like the idea behind these megathreads, and i will be following them around.
