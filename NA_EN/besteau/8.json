Here&#039;s a little about me. \n\nMy name is Besteau (Pronounced: Bĕs-tō). Darius is my favorite champion. I love to draw and I&#039;m self teaching myself digital art. In old GD I used to make doodle threads to warm myself up for commission work. Sometimes I stream the process. I work a full-time job in food service where I serve and take care of elderly residents.\n\n#**Here&#039;s some examples of what I have drawn:**\nhttps://68.media.tumblr.com/23dd03649e68803d55dd4621d93d9da9/tumblr_or10ohu5LN1uxiyfto1_540.png\nhttps://68.media.tumblr.com/c1eef0bc1fb528c2f0940d3e01a34546/tumblr_o406jtKG8e1uxiyfto1_540.png\nhttps://68.media.tumblr.com/b07a5ea988d32bca328dd09d21b41ed9/tumblr_opva9kaEeX1uxiyfto5_540.png\nhttp://i.imgur.com/wvLh3aQ.png\n#**Here&#039;s the examples of a &quot;low quality doodle&quot;:**\nhttps://68.media.tumblr.com/fdcb40ce6fb6f5b6642d2e36e46deaf8/tumblr_ot409zvzk31uxiyfto7_540.png\nhttps://68.media.tumblr.com/ab7eaf731548b92ff567567fa9f30f5b/tumblr_ot409zvzk31uxiyfto3_540.png\nhttps://68.media.tumblr.com/5cc5edd0cc51c5695fc1712df19b1f92/tumblr_otmdb4y4381uxiyfto1_540.png\nhttps://68.media.tumblr.com/181b6448970ab04e64be5460fa548e11/tumblr_ou5yvsrub51uxiyfto4_540.png\n\n#**Here&#039;s some memes:**\nPacha Meme\nhttps://68.media.tumblr.com/4f2c72eff05e28aaef62b4f30c7c909f/tumblr_o7m06rf0KU1uxiyfto1_540.png\n&quot;DaRiYo&quot;\nhttps://68.media.tumblr.com/31f5817caf99884020778e166492f08b/tumblr_omxnc9LZ4G1uxiyfto1_100.png\n\n_________________________________________________________\n\nWhat I want to introduce to you, is a re-usable art request thread to celebrate the merge of GD and Miscellaneous and bring everyone together.\n\nRules: \n1. I only do requests to warm myself up for commissions. I can stop at any time and skip requests that are infuriating to draw.\n2. Just because you request art doesn&#039;t guarantee you&#039;re going to get it. Please don&#039;t get mad if I don&#039;t do your piece. \n3. Stick to one character. I won&#039;t do two characters in one piece. I encourage emotion and action requests.\n4. I only do low quality doodles for free. \n\nYou can use these little doodles as FEK avatars, which help the community recognize each other with pairing the name with the avatar.\n\nNow. Request Awaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay!\n\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/the_besteau","replies":[]}
