They&#039;re just more successful than other plants. Don&#039;t down them because of their constant success. \n\nTake the dandelion species; {{champion:92}}  *Rivenxacum * for example. its very successful at growing out of control in favorable conditions!\n\nOr how about this species {{champion:1}} _Taranniecum_. It can hold onto that stun like it holds onto the dirt with those roots! There&#039;s no way of pulling her out of this!\n\nLets not forget about {{champion:91}} _Taraxatalon_. Just the use of its last ability, it just poofs up in the air and no one knows where it sows.\n\nLastly;  {{champion:150}} {{champion:74}} {{champion:117}} {{champion:78}} {{champion:68}} {{champion:17}} {{champion:18}} {{champion:115}}{{champion:42}}   the _Yordleacum_. They never seem to stop spawning and their diffusion into the environment is global. You can never stomp them out! \n\nJust because you can&#039;t evolve to beat them doesn&#039;t mean you need to tear them down. You need to be stronger than them!\n\n\n**Learn them, and you learn to play against them**\n\n\\#Theonlythingcancerhereisyou","replies":[]}
