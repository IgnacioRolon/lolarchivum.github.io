This is the first time I'll be publicly venting.","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] General Discussion","up_votes":10,"down_votes":4,"body":"So I get a phone call from my pharmacy telling me that my insurance is no longer going to cover my birth control that I receive from them and I will have to get it from mail. They decided to tell me this when I was on my last pill getting ready to pick up my next batch. So I asked the gentleman on the phone if my insurance would cover the one I had called for in advance and they said no. &quot;How much is it sir, out of pocket and will I be reimbursed by my insurance company?&quot; \n\nHim: It will be twenty dollars and they *should* reimburse you, it just involves some paperwork.\n\nSo I give the guy an earful of what I think of those money grubbing bastards willing to fuck up someones day/month just cause they want to not spend as much through a third party company. My grandmother had mail prescriptions and had nothing but a bad time with them. Considering I&#039;m moving out with my boyfriend and best friend soon I&#039;d have to go through the process of recontacting my insurance company about my change of address.\n\nThe point I&#039;m trying to make is it was such fucking abysmal timing on the insurance company&#039;s behalf. \n#**I suffer from Menorrhagia to the point where i pass the fuck out.** \nSo i have the birth control to limit my period to about 3 days from my &quot;normal&quot; 9 and makes the bleeding lighter. I only get about 20 bucks a month to spend on myself (Training my spending habits since I did some budgeting and im pretending that im &quot;moved out&quot;) So what im gonna do is ask for them to keep it at rite aid and if i have to pay a few bucks out of pocket to keep it at Rite Aid then so be it.\n\nImagine if i didn&#039;t have the spare funds to cover for it. \n\nThey&#039;re gonna fuck up my cycle and absorb my time they&#039;re gonna learn on the other end of the line that a woman on her period is not someone to \n#FUCK WITH.\n\n\n\nSo who wants to play a game of league with me so I can get my mind off of this.","replies":[]}
