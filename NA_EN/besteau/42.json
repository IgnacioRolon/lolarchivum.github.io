Sometimes they&#039;re cute, useful or they&#039;re terrifying. \nIn D&amp;D they are used as traps in dungeons engulfing everything in their path.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/sRrOh3X.jpg\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/OYUdVWr.jpg\n\n\n> **Engulf (Ex)**\n######Although it moves slowly, a gelatinous cube can simply mow down Large or smaller creatures as a standard action. It cannot make a slam attack during a round in which it engulfs. The gelatinous cube merely has to move over the opponents, affecting as many as it can cover. Opponents can make opportunity attacks against the cube, but if they do so they are not entitled to a saving throw. Those who do not attempt attacks of opportunity must succeed on a DC 13 Reflex save or be engulfed; on a success, they are pushed back or aside (opponent&rsquo;s choice) as the cube moves forward. Engulfed creatures are subject to the cube&rsquo;s paralysis and acid, and are considered to be grappled and trapped within its body. The save DC is Strength-based and includes a +1 racial bonus.\n\n\n In Slime Rancher they make cute pets. \nhttps://i.imgur.com/EsfhxE9.png\n\n\nIn other RPG&#039;s their remains can be picked up and used into craft-able items.\nhttps://media.giphy.com/media/b6u0L5RMreKpW/200.gif \nhttp://i.imgur.com/ZYHjD.png\n\nMy Favorite Slime: Alolan Muk https://i.imgur.com/suXePD3.gif\nThis thing fucking carried me through sun and moon and it devoured everything in its path. Grade &#039;A&#039; Slime monster.\n\nLeast Favorite Slime: http://www.therobotsvoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Slime.jpg\nThat smile disturbs me. :(\n\n\n________________________________________________________\n#**Whats your favorite RPG monster?
