Everything else on my computer is fin but when I go to play league I cant see the top of my screen (so the kills/timers) or my mana bar or the right side of the map etc, i tried every resolution and nothing works and tried to edit the res in the config files but nothing worked. Please help, it's extremely annoying to play with a bunch of my screen missing.\r\n\r\nOk for some reason my map is fine now but the top and left side is still messed up.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-17T18:20:55.556+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you on a 4K or exceeding 1920x1080?  Those settings can cause issues like this, so reducing your resolution should help if it's the case for you.  In addition to resteting your config as you've already done, what happens if you toggle your game to Fullscreen?

It sounds like you were able to reset your config if those changes occurred, though not really optimal.  Reach out to us in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) so our tech team can look into this.  In the meantime, you may need to try another monitor to restore your game screen to normal.
