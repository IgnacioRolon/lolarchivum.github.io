Is it an NA region url?  You should log off completely from the website, and login directly at the [na league site](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/).  You may also need to try Incognito or another browser in case a caching issue or extension is getting in the way.

I've been trying to get into the PBE for 3 seasons every now and then pressing the button again just to be sure. At first I thought the error was because I was using a browser no one else uses, Vivaldi, which works very similarly to chrome. However, using firefox, google chrome, and internet explorer all used the same results. No vpns or firewall blocks were happening either, so it has something to do with the actual website itself methinks","replies":[]}]}
