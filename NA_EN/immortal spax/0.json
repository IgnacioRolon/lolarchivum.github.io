If before was unfair, now with the new mastery is even more unfair, green father gift and the other mastery gives her a good poke with a ridicolous cd, and the funny part, the last quinn i played against had the colossus mastery, which pops with her E (?), so even if i was playing Irelia, she killed me with surving with minimal hp.\r\n\r\nWhat are some tips to play against her.(pls, no answers like &quot;dont stay in lane&quot; or &quot;farm under tower till jungler ganks&quot; they are not usefull tips)\r\n\r\n\r\nConsider also that  i will not play top with exhaust, i need tp to put pressure in map, and considering that i will lose the lane anyway, its not worth.","replies":[{"poster":"EpicMusic","date":"2016-11-10T20:15:47.273+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"you dont","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-11-10T20:16:00.014+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You dont.

Irelia is the one melee champ that actually hardcounters ranged champs. You just have to wait for Quinn to stand somewhere near an almost dead minion, Q to that minion to kill it and reset your gapcloser, wait for her to somersault away from you because you're close to her, then use your Q to get on top of her and ruffle her feathers.\nAlternately, if it's a bad Quinn, you walk right up to her, she somersaults back, and then you gapclose and beatdown.\n\nIf you're not Irelia, you hug your turret, stick your thumb up your ass, and cry to your jungler. You may find solace in the fact that your team has a better chance of winning if you don't feed during the laning phase since you'll be more useful than her later on, but that's little comfort as you spend the first 10-15 minutes of the game in absolute misery.\n\nWhich is also why Riot isn't looking at the ranged vs melee problem in top lane all that seriously; melees still tend to win the game and have the higher winrates. However, that laning phase is pure torture that pretty much takes all the fun out of the win. We're going to have to wait until one of the members of the balance team plays a Garen into a Kennen top and has the worst laning experience of his life for action to finally be taken.","replies":[{"poster":"Immortal spax","date":"2016-11-12T16:40:44.443+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"as i said, she had the tank mastery, and she survived 2 times with minimal hp, also i was first time irelia and she had ignite, but we won the game anyway even if at one point of the game i was 1-8, but this is not the problem, even if you dont feed and hug the tower, she can anyway roam and pick a kill mid, return top without missing a wave, and this is unfair.","replies":[{"poster":"BastionKross","date":"2016-11-12T17:41:55.113+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you want to stop the roam, be aggressive. Quinn has a hard time roaming if she's only got half her HP bar and has the wave pushed to her part of the lane. That way if she goes mid the mid laner could very well kill her since she's wounded, or if she does get a kill you can push the wave and be at her tower as soon as she leaves. Spam pinging your mid laner to let them know the bird is on the way sometimes helps immensely as well; a roam isn't worth it if you don't get anything.\n\nGranted this only works for Irelia specifically, but then again a lot of things only work for Irelia.","replies":[{"poster":"Immortal spax","date":"2016-11-12T23:28:27.607+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=BastionKross,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=wr79V8lE,comment-id=000700000000,timestamp=2016-11-12T17:41:55.113+0000)\n>\n>Spam pinging your mid laner \n> \n\nlol, maybe this works in your elo, but here even if i ping them in their room they will stil not notice them and find a way to blame someone else.\n\nbtw it seems like only olaf and double ring nasus can do something against here, balanced champ.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2016-11-10T20:16:18.121+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you have poke, you poke her. \nQuinn is annoying for a reason.

All you have to do is Q her when she tries to harass; after you hit level 6, you can pretty much kill her whenever you want without any issues.\n\nSinged is a pretty funny option too.  While early-game can be brutal, you just need to rush armor (possibly Thornmail) and let her kill herself on you.  You can Fling her during her Vault animation, cancelling it and placing her into your poison.\n\nBoth of them outscale Quinn and are far more useful as the game progresses.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2016-11-12T15:20:44.383+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sion has great poke.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Requiemsfire","date":"2016-11-12T13:19:32.595+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Like any other ranged toplaner or any laner in general, you evaluate risk versus reward.
