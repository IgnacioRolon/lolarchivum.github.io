Trundle easily sustains in lane against most of them, and once he accumulates enough items he can run at them and stomp them in a 1v1.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bruised Ego","date":"2016-10-03T11:47:04.960+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think its because of the ranged meta like you said.

They are just good picks at the moment. Also, Kennen and Jayce really didn't start popping up more often until they were used in pro play very often, which is relatively recent. Trundle mainly has a bad win rate Top because the Jugg update made his previous lane strengths less notable in Top Lane. He can still steal stats and have his Pillar, but everything he can do offensively can basically be done better by someone else. It is better to put him in a position that doesn't make your team have one less super damage threat.\nAlso, he is just not as good when you use him without a team. His ult isn't super apparent unless pointed out, so teams make better use of it. Also, his pillar is something that only teams really make good use of and can communicate proper placement of it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ProfDrDeath","date":"2016-10-03T12:20:48.096+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The reason for Trundle being bad in solo queue is, well, solo queue.\n\nHis main assets (Pillar, tank-destroying ult) are much more useful in coordinated play, and he received nerfs for his strengths in that field. In solo queue, he cannot go toe-to-toe with a lot of the popular picks (he has losing match-ups against the 10 most popular top laners).
