There are dozens of champions that counter him hardcore . Nautilus,Alistar,Rammus to name a few .\n\nHis jungle is pretty weak . He is one trick pony and people can punish that kind of gameplay .","replies":[{"poster":"Nucleophilic atk","date":"2014-10-11T20:27:37.332+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've learned to ignore \"Fiddles is OP\" posts. Either the person is trolling and never even played against or with Fiddles and is just trying to get a reaction, or they are just that stupid that they don't understand the million (exaggeration here...but there are so many) ways to counter Fiddles. In either scenario, it is not worth talking to the person. Given the tone of this guys argument, I would guess the former.","replies":[{"poster":"Wållace","date":"2014-11-09T18:00:14.240+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"you are retarded kid","replies":[{"poster":"Nucleophilic atk","date":"2014-11-09T18:56:23.526+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"If you are going to call me retarded, please at least use proper grammar in doing so. Making simple grammar errors pretty much makes any \"retarded, stupid, or dumb\" comment invalid. Also, you call me retarded, yet you think Fiddles is OP.
