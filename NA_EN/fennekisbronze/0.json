I'm honestly trying to figure out what I did or said that would get me in trouble and the only thing I could possibly think of is the fact that I played Yasuo and did poorly. Even then, I can't think of anything that I said that was even remotely toxic, I didn't trash talk and I wasn't even tilted that game. I was just dashing around and trying to figure out how to play Yasuo properly. Any advice on this matter is appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-10-16T23:15:26.125+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"You get a popup in the client as well as an email, both explaining why you got restricted/banned and providing chatlogs, if relevant.\n\nIf you got neither of those, send a polite support ticket to riot asking for an explanation and further investigation if you feel it is an error.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tele II","date":"2019-10-17T00:00:37.267+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well... what did they tell you you were punished for?
