Submitted a ticket and got treated like a psycho that wanted someone to kill himself.\r\n\r\nNo intention to complain, I just want to solve this. Some will think I probably said something worst or other games influenced the decition but no, all chat logs sent by Riot have no toxicity or have an intention to avoid toxicity like \"Im muting you zed\" or \"please stop\", \"play the game\".\r\nI would post them no problem but I don't know if it is appropiate.\r\n\r\nMy support got collapsed and said \"kys kys kys\" in chat fast with the intention of reminding him he could get an execute and avoid giving gold. The ticket support guy told me \"Behavioral punishments are issued based on the severity of the situation. Unfortunately, the account exhibited some very extreme behavior that we can't ignore. In the game, you're telling players to harmthemselves. That's really, really not okay.\"\r\n\r\nI really need help for this. Every response Riot gives is just robotic and they seem to not be able to check the game in question regarding \"kys\" chat log.","replies":[{"poster":"Dark Morgana","date":"2017-08-10T20:40:13.912+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"The truth of the matter is that KYS in any form is not okay and isn't taken lightly. Whether you meant it in a different context or not, the wording wasn't the best choice and the suspension isn't something that we can lift. This is only a two week suspension, so you have plenty of time to reform from here to then.","replies":[{"poster":"Furious Bonobo","date":"2017-08-10T21:04:14.546+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it just amazes me how fucking pathetic riot can be, do you have any idea how many people have told me way way way worse stuff in a game, ive been told to kill myself, told my mother would be killed, told my mother would be raped and much much more and you ban this guy for saying KYS.  i didnt even report these people, do you know why? because i told them to go fuck their dogs, do you know why?? because its a fucking video game, this isnt morality class but i understand u California idiots dont understand the difference. why do you even allow people to chat if you cant even type 3 letters into chat without being banned \n\nriot why dont you KYS. am i banned now?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Quackas","date":"2017-08-10T20:47:52.810+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No one is going to believe that context. \n\nNice try.","replies":[]}]}
