I've had no serious issues and always had the same one account for 9 years. That account got banned in the period of 3 weeks because I said the f word (I'm gay and I say it all the time in real life and will continue to say it). I've never been banned from any game or anything else in my entire life.\n\nI disagreed on it being worth a perm ban, but understood the reasoning behind it and made a second account I would refrain from using banned words on. Since then, Riot has implemented in their banning/punishment system regarding the chat log is that either one 'banned' (but still sharable?) word or a handful of instances of not being nice enough critiquing gameplay and they'll put temp and perm bans on your account.\n\nI'm completely over it and uninterested giving this company anymore of my time or money unless they fix their chat/banning system.  \n\nThe toxicity situation in League is only going to get worse as the number of non-chat trolls will grow and legit players will get frustrated and leave. Yes, you can get banned for non-chat toxic gameplay, but it's much, much less likely and toxic gameplay happens all the time. Chat however will auto-trigger from catchphrases. \n\nI still have a playable account, but after being recently temp banned for responding to a group of people actively griefing me in game, I refuse to be actively abused anymore while riot waits to ban me for reacting.\n\nI remember a time in gaming where you either got banned for something actually serious or by a childish moderator. Sadly, that time is over and now we have a monster of a system that lets you get berated and harassed unless you mute everyone all the time or you're forced to take it. \n\nI'm ending this abusive relationship and honestly, I think it will be for the better.","replies":[{"poster":"insomniacjezz","date":"2019-07-01T22:36:54.144+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"There aren’t even hundreds of thousands of hours in ten years’ time...","replies":[{"poster":"TiltaryClinton","date":"2019-07-01T22:48:09.543+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":7,"body":"It's close. 11+ years would fit.

The fact that it is more or less 100% automated for chat toxicity means it is the least random punishment system you'll ever find.  Old Tribunal is random.  If you give people a chat log one day and give them the exact same chat log a week later, the % vote to punish will vary.  That's because human is random.  The Instant Feedback System works off of the exact same algorithm that judges a chatlog today the exact same way it judges the same chat log next week.  That is not random.  The IFS is incapable of being bias or have emotions or just decide on its own to punish people more any particular day of the week like a human would.\n\nI do not support League's decisions no matter what.

Either make it 100% reliable and send us feedback notice every single report we make or just do away with it completely and send nothing like the old days.  If you put aside your bias of the board for a moment and you will notice many others including Specialists and mods and board regulars who do criticize and against one or more part of League's behavior system.  They most certainly do not auto downvote anything that is against them.  I have not vote on your thread one way or the other for example.\n\nWhether you are in a coffee shop or a super market or a movie theater or a bar, if you start being upset and yell at another customer(s) and most especially throwing slurs, homophobic, and racist comments telling other to kill themselves, you will likely see both you and the other customer being thrown out of that venue.

The fact that they have no real viable ways (that doesn't cause collateral damage) to prevent you from making new account in their free-to-play model doesn't mean they doing it on purpose.

What insane mind think it's a good business model to throw customers out in the middle of the movie in hope they will come back to buy a 2nd ticket for the same movie.  Or better question, what insane person DO come back to buy a 2nd ticket for the same movie when they got thrown out of the first one and at risk of that happening again before they can finish the movie?\n\nI have never understood this conspiracy theory.

This is a highly competitive game. I can't name one other competitive game in which you get banned for literally bantering.

When I posted here about it, people responded saying my ban was justified because I was being annoying. Because being annoying is most certainly an offence. Riot needs context, and they need actual humans policing it. I'm done with this game.

These forums do absolutely nothing to honestly reform anyone because the only legit way to avoid banning is just muting and not using chat. Aka, the chat system doesn't work.\n\nIt's not a competitive chat if you can't tell your teammates they aren't playing correctly or criticizing behavior, especially harder to report behavior. If you can't do that then they just need to remove chat like other games that don't want to deal with it.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Telephone Booth","date":"2019-07-02T22:00:44.194+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If a game isnt satisfying, why play it?

Is that friend important to you? Do they have anything to offer you in return? Do you feel you need a return? Do you feel you have a dutyto help? Maybe explore the idea of what you are and arent responsible for? Do you morals dictate an obligation to help? Itsreally a personal choice, imo. No one hasthe secrets to life, so you decide what your morals are. Dont let others decide for you, they know nothing more than you about morality. You use your logic to decide, and I will respect whatever conclusion you come to.\n\nAs far as letting a game, you no longer enjoy, die; Yes. Let it die. Its just a game, not a human life. But theres factors that go into that too. How important is this video game to you personally? Is the games impending death just your perception, or is it fact? Is it just dead to you due to not enjoying it personally? Do others still enjoy it? What impact do you think you could really have in bringing change? Whats the cost/return? So many things to consider! I have to get backto work. Good luck with whatever you decide.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"SKT T1 DRACOS","date":"2019-07-01T23:00:33.989+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just Mute them If they start getting toxic.
