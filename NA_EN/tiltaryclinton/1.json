It kept going past that image and had 2-3x that number of downvoted post. Sounds like damage control.\n\nSecond, and the reason I'm here, I went Ocean/Warden/Mage last game... got 3rd place, and could not get a 3rd copy of Vladimir. I ended with a lvl 1 Vlad and one on my bench. NO ONE was going Ocean/Mage except 1 person who had 3 copies of Vlad. I re-rolled with most of my gold. Easily 30 or more re rolls. Where were all the Vladimir cards? There's only 5 Vlads in the whole game? I got lvl 3 Thresh mid-game. It's not possible that he was 100% being taken by the shops all game despite my re-rolls.","replies":[{"poster":"NeonPanda","date":"2020-02-07T18:15:56.464+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"So you played a game of tft and couldn't level up one champion?  MASSIVE shock, game must be broken!  \n\nTFT is just about probability, and there is a probability of just about anything happening, including not getting a third vladmir the whole game.","replies":[{"poster":"TiltaryClinton","date":"2020-02-07T18:40:29.910+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"At what point does that probability become improbable? Vlad is an easy to obtain champion and not seeing a 3rd copy come the entire game to 3rd place despite spending a massive amount of money on re-rolls makes no sense. I would agree if it was a zed or olaf.\n\nWith the comp, I had to use vlad for the mage/ocean properties. No one was using him. It is improbable that he doesn't show up ever despite rolling through 30+x5 cards (on top of the normal rolls). TFT has probablility, but the point of looking at what is being used is supposed to be part of the game and it fails to work. I can't switch over to other comps being used (which weirdly still showed up) and my comp was powerful and open. How am I supposed to calculate for the generator somehow not showing me a completely open lvl 1 champ all game?\n\nThat's the definition of an unplayable game. I might as well just close the game before I start if it randomly decides it will block my win.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"NeonPanda","date":"2020-02-20T21:20:17.120+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How else should the system work?

Also remember that everyone is playing on the same algorithm, so even if it is frustrating sometimes, it's equally frustrating for everyone else.","replies":[]}]}
