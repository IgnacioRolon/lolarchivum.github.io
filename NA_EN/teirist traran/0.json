We can expect these damage nerfs to actually be *buffs* to juggernauts and divers, because their targets don't have a lot of hp in the first place and their primary weakness right now is the inability to survive. High damage-dealers like ADCs (aka: Jhin) get nerfed by all the *% damage reductions* wayyy more than someone that only needs to dish out 1.5-2k damage to kill the target.\n\n> He. Needs. Nerfs.\n\nYou've yet to explain why he needs nerfs...he's has been sitting at a 51-52% win ratio for the past 5+ patches. That's *consistence*. You know who else has been consistent? Amumu has had a 51-53% win rate for about 2 seasons now. Janna has had a 53%+ win rate for like, 10 seasons (I don't actually know but it's been awhile).\n\nBut because Amumu and Janna don't kill you fast, you don't think they're incredibly op. Because Jhin can burst you, you view that as \"op\" and inherently \"game breaking\" despite his consistent win-rate that shows the champion itself is only slightly above everyone else.\n\nBasically, you hate how he wins but you don't actually hate how often he wins, otherwise you'd be complaining about wayyy more applicable champs in terms of win-rate and consistency.","replies":[{"poster":"Ïnsidious","date":"2017-02-16T13:08:37.118+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":2,"body":"Agreed.
