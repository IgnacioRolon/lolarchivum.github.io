I was playing with the skin SKT T1 Zed. I was in top lane and I R&#039;d Sion, after this I seemed to disappear then I was killed by Sion. After this my shadow never left and when I went top again I was still able to cast spells and deal damage through the shadow, however i could not teleport to it.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Exgeniar","date":"2015-09-06T05:00:15.686+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Interesting.

And that his shadow creation sound is completely missing? It's not even swapped to where the jump sound used to be.\n\nHere is my thread in the Bug Report forum:\n\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report/PsjyzElZ-video-a-few-minor-aesthetic-bugs-with-project-zed\n\nAnd here is the video:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug2QT5E15cU\n\n(Do note that in the video, the noises are swapped, but on Live, Zed's shadow creation sound is completely missing, and the sound he makes when he creates his W shadow is switched to the sound he makes when he jumps to a shadow)\n\n(Also, this video shows a bug that removed his wind-down animation after doing an emote, but this is currently fixed on Live)\n\nIt's been a few days since I've made these threads now...and I really like the \"haaa\" sound that Zed makes when he creates his W shadow. I really want to know what happened to it. Is this a bug? Is this intended?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Exgeniar","date":"2015-09-07T03:53:30.930+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, my boss has forwarded me your thread.
