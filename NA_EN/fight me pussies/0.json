(so i can stream it to my laptop)","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yep, that's my question.  I added league as a steam game but it only finds the old client, and im pretty sure it wont switch to the actual game when it starts even if i could find the new client. help please.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-08T17:04:06.567+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We don't technically support Steam, so I couldn't really say for sure (I haven't personally tried).  My best guess is that you'll have to add a non-steam game through their settings, and search for the updated client.  League still needs to run through the patcher so you'll need to look for the client and not the game itself.  If that doesn't help, you may need to check their support resources.  I hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
