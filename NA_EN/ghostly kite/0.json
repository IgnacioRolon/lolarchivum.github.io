I would like to know if changing the language from English to any other is something ilegal? I won't use any program to do this. I will only modify the files of the game client, it doens't make anything else besides change the language of everything in the Client, including voices. I wish this was a original feacture but it doesn't seem to be the case at least here. :L\r\nI just wanna know if I can get banned for this.\r\n\r\nIf you want to know. The thing I will do is modify the file called \"System\" in \"Releases\" folder. I just have to put an \"en_US\" and that's it. nothing else.\r\n\r\nAny answer is appreciate and sorry if my gramar is not the best.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-24T03:24:43.364+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You should be able to change the language on the login section of the client just below where you would choose your region. If the language you're wanting isn't one of the supported ones for your region, even editing that file may not work since they might be overwritten after logging in.","replies":[]}]}
