It has made me come back to the original skin, even though I&#039;ve bought the project yas skin.\r\n\r\nFix it please? Just replace the circle radius of the whirlwind to make it look like more of the original skin&#039;s radius and maybe the high noon&#039;s radius. But instead of a blue or orange circle, make the project yasuo&#039;s circle red or something, I&#039;d really appreciate it and I think alot of other yasuo mains would like this to be updated aswell.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-07-10T23:42:52.333+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Kim Johnny Un,\n\nI've gone ahead and taken a look at these visuals - they're working as intended. PROJECT: Yasuo's particle is a bit more stylized than the other skins, as both base Yasuo and High Noon Yasuo have nearly identical particles.","replies":[{"poster":"Spooky Trash","date":"2016-08-04T13:14:35.966+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"the skin needs a visual update though its the worst one out of all the other project skins it felt like a lazy output by riot from some random solo project it looks nothing like the other project skins it feels a bit clunky and the feel is some random guy walking round in a giant iron pot","replies":[{"poster":"CPU Entity","date":"2017-06-21T04:12:16.164+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's because it came out a long time ago, and Riot added a chain of new PROJECT: skins to get people to spend RP on them but tbh I agree he needs a visual update, in his loading screen card+in-game animations and character look. Oh yeah, and I do not like his AA animation, why is it so different from all the other Yasuo skins anyway? It doesn't feel as clean as the slash-through animation that all the other skins.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Stars Shaper","date":"2015-07-11T08:11:32.352+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The skin is really underwhelming.
