Was it changed so only she could hear it?","subforum":"Report a Bug","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So to make up for the fact i'm broke, decided to play some games as an adc hoping to find someone with the skin. Turns out, her music, unless they changed it, can no longer be heard globally by other teammates? And the option to mute her music is also no longer there as it was on PBE. All i hear in the BG is the default music for league. Im severely disappointed if this was on purpose, but otherwise i assume this is a bug. I asked other teammates if they could hear her music and everyone EXCEPT Sona said \"No\".","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-02-26T00:27:37.905+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hiya! \n\nAllies are able to hear DJ Sona's music. You'll need to opt into the experience by holding tab and clicking on the music note icon next to Sona's portrait.
