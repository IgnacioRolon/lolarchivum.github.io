I've played like 60 games in the past week and got 0 keys. I played with friends in rift and in ARAM, nothing seems to work. This is a new month so the key fragment system should reset itself, still no key fragments. \nHow does the system work riot? is it all luck? if so then you should probably change it to a something else like play 4 games get a key, win 4 games get a key, win 8 games get a key, and so on.

With each fragment you earn, the chance to earn your next one goes down slightly. This number resets roughly every thirty days after you earn your first key fragment.\n\n\nRiot wanted to give players who didn't play as frequently a good drop rate for keys, without making it feel like farming was mandatory if you wanted keys.\n\n\n\nNote: There's currently a bug which prevents you from earning key fragments if you're playing a champion you don't own. This is unintended, and a solution for this is being worked on.\n\n\n**[Learn to craft.
