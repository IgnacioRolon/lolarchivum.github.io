We end up winning, and she stayed in game taunting us the whole time in base, and she still gets LP and isn&#039;t going to be punished? Can Riot fucking do something about this, because I know damn well nothing will happen to her. Who cares if she does it only one time? Why can&#039;t you punish people for intentionally ruining other people&#039;s games, even if it&#039;s only one time? Stupid system, stuff like this happens all too often and nothing is ever done. The amount of times I get the &quot;Someone you recently reported has been punished!&quot; compared to how many times I report people for afk&#039;ing in base or leaving game is fucking ridiculous.","replies":[{"poster":"Buster Yasuo","date":"2017-11-11T12:24:08.242+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with you, had people intentionally feed then afk and got out unpunished. So I guess if they do that only a couple times a month they will not be punished at all. Honestly I have seen so many cases where people afk/intentionally feed/\"split pushing\" and got out unpunished. It is very questionable that if Riot really bans people. I even submitted a ticket once to report a guy who decided to \"split pushing\" the entire game in a ranked game, which is essentially giving enemy free kills as he was 0/10. He even typed in chat that he gave up. Riot said they will review this player however I have checked him on OP.GG and he is still playing every single day. I am not sure if Riot does not punish him because he is diamond and he had purchased a lot of RP? I don't know, the horrible community and the horrible new runes just make me want to quit the game now, most of my friends feel the same way too.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nithez","date":"2017-02-15T05:01:11.760+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maximum punishment?

Whereas currently we have leave buster in this case to deal with afkers.","replies":[{"poster":"Risa Audr","date":"2017-02-18T18:28:11.075+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But, you're not AFK when dancing around on the spawn point.
