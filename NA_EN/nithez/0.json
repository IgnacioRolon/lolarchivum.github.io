I then accidentally said to report the Eve on our team to the enemy instead of saying Xerath because she had been typing messages telling him to chill and overall taking my side that he was being super toxic. The support staff I've been talking to has said I'm getting perma banned for using homophobic slurs and falsely reporting, yet no where in this chat log do I call anyone a homophobic slur, I simply ask the dude flaming me to stop, and tell the enemy team what he was calling me so that they could report him (even tho I mistakenly ask them to report the wrong person; shouldn't be a big deal seeing as eve wasn't doing anything wrong and won't be punished; this is also the first time I've ever encouraged \"falsely reporting\" someone). Seems a bit harsh to permaban someone for accidentally saying one champs name instead of the other. Would love some insight on this. Is it because I am a month off a 2 week ban, and this is just to prove a point? I didn't break any guidelines here. Didn't flame anyone, call anyone names, encourage self harm, literally nothing besides asking the enemy to report the wrong person.","replies":[{"poster":"Imperial Pandaa","date":"2019-07-31T02:05:24.093+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because you repeated stupid shit (zero tolerance) and had a previous 14 day ban.
