Specifically, the first hit of his double strike and the next hit after will almost never crit. The hit before double strike, the second hit of double strike itself, and his first three hits before double strike activates can all crit normally. I went into a custom game today and played around for about two hours with lots of different builds and situations.\n\nIn summary, building only zeals and crit cloaks to reach 100% crit chance, every hit was a crit. However, upon activating highlander with these same items, I noticed that my crits were significantly reduced. Furthermore, building a complete phantom dancer with 100% crit chance reduced the number of crits significantly as well. Finally, building a full static shiv with 100% crit chance reduced the number of crits, but not by as much as the phantom dancer.\n\nHere is all the data that I gathered:\n\n70% crit, no PD, no highlander\ncrits: 18\nnon-crits: 13\ntotal: 58%\n\n70% crit, with PD, highlander for 7s\ncrits: 23\nnon-crits: 28\ntotal: 45%\n\n90% crit, with shiv, no highlander\ncrits: 32\nnon-crits: 15\ntotal: 68%\n\n50% crit, no PD, no highlander\ncrits: 25\nnon-crits: 16\ntotal: 60%\n\n100% crit, no PD, no highlander\ncrits: 29\nnon-crits: 0\ntotal: 100%\n\n100% crit, no PD, highlander\ncrits: 10\nnon-crits: 7\ntotal: 58%\n\nnote: only 50% crit chance during the 7s of highlander after first 3 hits\n\n100% crit, PD, no highlander\ncrits: 23\nnon-crits: 17\ntotal: 58%\nnote: first 3 hits always crit, 2nd ds hit and hit before ds always crit, 1st ds never crit, hit after ds only crit once\nnote: same result w/ highlander\n\n100% crit, shiv, no highlander\ncrits: 15\nnon-crits: 3\ntotal: 83%\n\n100% crit, shiv, highlander\nabout 70% (forgot to record)\n\nThe video is a link to the raw footage I counted these numbers from.","replies":[{"poster":"Have at ye","date":"2016-05-10T16:37:27.875+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Does 100% crit not mean 100% crit or something?

So testing for crit rate at 70% or 50% crit chance like that is not really relevant. Though it can be an indicator.\n\nWhat is relevant is 100% crit chance. Every time Yi swung his sword I saw orange text. So I don't know what you were seeing. He even got the bonus crit from his passive, though it was often expressed as the crit damage by itself and then the standard red text damage.\n\nThat being said, I feel if you crit, you should get nothing but orange text unless there is magic damage in there somewhere.","replies":[{"poster":"Dancery","date":"2016-05-16T05:50:52.921+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think you know what statistically significant means.
