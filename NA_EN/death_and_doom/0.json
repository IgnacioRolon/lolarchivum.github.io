Its a small change, and it wouldnt make braum OP OP, but it would ENABLE diversity. \n\nThe OPTION to play outside the intended role and do the unexpected is what makes MOBAS interesting to watch and play; Who would expect lulu to actually be a fantastic jungler? Galio an ADC? Annie a jungler? Udyr a support? \nYou wouldnt.
