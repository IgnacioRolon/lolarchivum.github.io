Their 25/3 record shows how much stronger they were in the summer split of 2013. And they were a major contributing factor to the growth of NA as a whole. Hai has done so much for the NA scene, just as much as the early founders of the scene, people like HotshotGG, Reggie, STVicious, and others.

I never said hai is stronger now, but I think in his prime Hai was better.\n\nYes. In one of the pieces when Bjerg first came over, he said of all the mids in NA, Hai gave him the most trouble. Hai in his prime, before the injuries, was at least on Bjerg's level. The Bjerg of today is not the Bjerg  of then, same as the Hai of today is nowhere near the Hai of then. The injuries pretty much ruined Hai, but thats life. He was a very strong mid before carpal tunnel and lung issues, that obviously limits the amount of time he can put into the game.\n\nHai's only problem back then, wasn't mechanics, it was his champion pool, which has always been shallow.\n\nBut people seem to only remember current events. Of course the Hai of today is honestly the worst mid laner in NA. But he was nowhere near this bad before all the crap happened to him. Just like the dominating force of Bjerg today was not anywhere near what he was when he first came over. \n\nI think if Hai was still on his game, before all the injuries, C9 would be perfectly fine. He would be, probably #2 mid NA. Instead, hes number 10 thanks to injuries.\n\nAnd, I think other posters hit another key point; Balls has been underperforming for a while now, too. The only 3 players playing at a consistently decent level is Sneaky, Meteos, and Lemonation. Esp. Sneaky and Meteos. Balls hasnt been good at all this split.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Sammystorm","date":"2015-04-23T22:54:49.069+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I fwe don't use stats the comparisons boil down to opinion which is not productive.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"daemanic","date":"2015-04-23T22:56:24.366+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you have to put into the fact C9 went 25-3 in 2013 only team close was TSM at 14-14 LOL","replies":[{"poster":"ZeroAnarchy","date":"2015-04-23T23:00:07.034+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":" You can still be worse than the other mid but still win because you have different strengths (Hai - Shotcalling) and how C9 were very good in teamplay.
