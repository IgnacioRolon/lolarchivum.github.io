HE IS SUCH A GOD!!!!!&quot; the general opinion of bengi is  &quot;yeah, he is pretty good on the whole, but let&#039;s talk some more about Faker again.&quot;\r\n\r\nDon&#039;t get me wrong, I am not trying to take anything away from Faker. It is just that I think Bengi deserves a little more credit than he gets often from casters and fans. This dude has been around a long time, has plenty of trophies under his belt, and makes a strong case for the best jungler to play League of Legends.\r\n\r\nI might be alone here, but I just thought I would throw that out there.","replies":[{"poster":"Rio Sanguino","date":"2016-10-30T17:02:14.631+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"You're right man.

Definitely my favorite member of SKT. I feel like not only is he overlooked but Fakers attitude makes it even worse. They asked Bengi how he felt being with Faker for so long and he acted like he enjoyed his time. All Faker had to say was basically \"hes a good jungler\". No attachment to his teammate. Also Ive noticed Faker in general is becoming way more cocky. I know he's looked up to by SO many people but honestly he used to be so humble and now hes like yeah no need to cheer cuz were gonna be here again next year. So arrogant now.

People will just say Kobe Bryant did it again he carried the Lakers to a Championship, but people forget about Ariza's steals and Pau's effort, Fisher's 3's etc etc.  \n\n  Overall the important thing is that Faker himself thanks Benji for everything he has done on SKT with him that is why they are both still playing together and both are still winning but again it's a TEAM.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sagan Forever","date":"2016-10-30T22:02:54.891+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think Bengi is the best support jungle in the game, and this is what SKT seems to want from thier jungle so he is the best jungle for SKT. Although I will say that SKT won the group stage and the quarterfinal with blank along with spring split, and MSI. I also do not think SKT lost games 2 nor 3 in the semifinal because of blank. With that said Bengi could be the clutchest player in the game, when he is needed the most he's throws up huge.
