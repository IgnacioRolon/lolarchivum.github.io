LEGENDARY SNOWBALL STARTS DECEMBER 23 AND ENDS JANUARY 7!\r\nWhen you buy or receive a Legendary or Ultimate skin this Snowdown, you’ll unlock a free Mystery skin! If that Mystery skin happens to be a Legendary or Ultimate, it unlocks another Mystery skin and can continue to snowball from there. As an added bonus, we’re doubling your chance to unlock a Legendary when you receive each Legendary Snowball Mystery skin.\"\r\n\r\nBut I couldn't figure out if I get the bonus mystery skin, my friend does, or we both do. Can anyone help me out with this?","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-12-17T16:36:21.831+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you gift, only your friend will receive the bonus Mystery Skin.","replies":[{"poster":"TheSequelsRBad","date":"2015-12-17T17:07:59.310+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"K, thanks for responding, even though you were the bearer of bad news. :(","replies":[]}]}]}
