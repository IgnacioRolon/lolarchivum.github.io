This only happens when playing League, and normally around 11PM Central Time.  I normally average around 45ms ping, but when it gets bad it never goes below 150, typically hovers around 250, and frequently spikes up to 330.  I can run a speedtest to a Chicago-area server and get 50-60ms ping and 80mbps/8mbps down/upload speeds while getting these bad latency periods.\r\n\r\nHere's a tracert that I just ran; you can see I have no issues until I hit riotdirect.\r\n\r\n  1    &lt;1 ms    &lt;1 ms    &lt;1 ms  192.168.0.1\r\n  2    12 ms    22 ms     9 ms  cpe-70-121-192-1.satx.res.rr.com [70.121.192.1]\r\n\r\n  3    27 ms    20 ms    23 ms  tge0-0-1.snaxtx4001h.texas.rr.com [24.28.134.177\r\n]\r\n  4    42 ms    32 ms    37 ms  agg21.snaptx1901r.texas.rr.com [24.175.33.72]\r\n  5    11 ms    12 ms    11 ms  agg22.snavtxuu02r.texas.rr.com [24.175.32.160]\r\n  6    15 ms    15 ms    16 ms  agg23.hstqtxl301r.texas.rr.com [24.175.32.156]\r\n  7    19 ms    15 ms    23 ms  bu-ether16.hstqtx0209w-bcr00.tbone.rr.com [66.10\r\n9.6.108]\r\n  8    24 ms    23 ms    23 ms  bu-ether12.dllstx976iw-bcr00.tbone.rr.com [66.10\r\n9.6.39]\r\n  9    19 ms    23 ms    17 ms  0.ae4.pr1.dfw10.tbone.rr.com [107.14.19.97]\r\n 10    22 ms    18 ms    24 ms  24.27.236.233\r\n 11    25 ms    19 ms    24 ms  104.160.134.35\r\n 12   433 ms   428 ms   399 ms  ae35-br02.chi01.riotdirect.net [104.160.159.24]\r\n\r\n 13    40 ms    39 ms    38 ms  ae1-br01.chi01.riotdirect.net [104.160.159.8]\r\n 14   458 ms   484 ms   459 ms  104.160.131.1\r\n\r\nAny idea how to fix this?","replies":[{"poster":"Slimegoon","date":"2017-01-10T01:21:33.028+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Any help?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-30T18:29:34.665+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Based on these logs, it looks like there's an issue on node 11 that's having problems sending information to 12 which is riot direct.
