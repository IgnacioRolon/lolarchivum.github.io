Game loads and he has masteries that no Graves would use.  Proceeds to go down mid without saying a word, clearly running some sort of bot.  He didn&#039;t run straight to mid, he ran down mid, stopped, kept running, stopped, etc.  He was dead within 2 minutes after standing toe-to-toe with Twisted Fate and not moving.  He respawns and makes the same erratic movements, this time towards top, where he dies again.  Repeat with bottom lane, repeat the remainder of the game.  At times he would freeze as the enemy was approaching, then still run straight into the crowd without firing a single shot.  He ended 0/14/0 without ever saying a word.  I&#039;m not sure if I actually saw him cast a single spell.\r\n\r\nLooking through his match history, this has been constant.  He has a game with Jinx going 0/10+/0 with Smite.  He has games with 1 kill and many deaths running Smite on champions that don&#039;t jungle, without setting masteries.  He tends to play Twisted Treeline, probably because of how poor his bot is in Summoner&#039;s Rift (although he does terribly in TT too).\r\n\r\nIf Riot takes these things seriously, how come anyone with access to LoLNexus can figure out someone&#039;s botting, but you don&#039;t ban them?  I wonder how many Xerath scripters are just laughing somewhere where their new ranks and no bans.","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-04-15T14:24:09.833+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"They do bans for these in wavs to make it more difficult for the ones writing the programs to tell what got them caught.\n\nJust report at the end of the game with the appropriate option and he will get the ban hammer when his time comes.","replies":[{"poster":"Slimegoon","date":"2017-04-15T17:08:31.652+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's great, but he's played 6 games since the one he's played with me, including another 0/14 outing.
