Besides that, Riot doesn&#039;t seem to have done absolutely anything besides skin and  champion &quot;balance&quot;. (notice it&#039;s in quotes... There has been invisible nidalee spears for months now and nothing done about it. Pathing around minions is still a complete joke, you stand there spazzing out for up to like 3 seconds before it lets you past sometimes. Zed has been disabled for 3 or 4 days now because they can&#039;t be bothered to fix an extremely simple bug. Elise is sitting at about a 42% win rate in an unplayable state, and again, absolutely nothing done from Riot. Riot does absolutely NOTHING except nerf champions that actually *gasp* require skill to play. Who would have thought a champ with skill would be better than champions that don&#039;t require skill when played to their full potential? Is this just some game breaking new feature where skill means something?! OMG riot please nerf them! The only reason they even nerf these champs is because people will endlessly complain about them on the forums until they are nerfed to an unplayable to stop the complaints. This is just an endless loop of complaints and then nerfs. Take a look at the champs with the highest win rates, wukong, malzahar, miss fortune, volibear. (yes malz has one skillshot but it&#039;s impossible to miss because of his ult) Now look at the champs with the lowest win rates, nidalee, cassiopeia, azir, lee sin, twisted fate, ect. It&#039;s not just non-skillful champions being ALMOST as good whilre requiring no skill, no, they are flat out BETTER. Yes, most of the champs that require skill are sitting around the middle, but there absolutely should NOT be champs like ziggs with lower winrates than annie, garenn, master yi, etc. It&#039;s not just a lack of skill from the playerbase either, champions like wukong, udyr, and annie all have extremely high win rates at a challenger level as well. Riot needs to stop nerfing champions that require skill and realize that people are only complaining because they got outplayed fairly and refuse to accept that. TL:DR Champions that require no skill have higher win rates than champions that require skill. Yes, even at a challenger level...","replies":[{"poster":"Lugg","date":"2015-07-15T03:31:50.867+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I guess you missed the whole new SR map at the begging of the season.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Leu07","date":"2015-07-15T03:08:23.255+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree, sometimes it is frustrating to actually learn a high skill cap champ like {{champion:268}} , {{champion:69}}  and {{champion:60}} and riot just nerfs them to the ground, I suppose they are hard to balance aswell...","replies":[]},{"poster":"EffectFX","date":"2015-07-14T23:07:11.080+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rueian","date":"2015-07-14T23:02:03.951+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:223}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"DerZermetzelte","date":"2015-07-14T23:01:13.459+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First you complained about nothing happening concerning balance, then you are mad about champion changes.
