With what we&#039;ve seen in the past too, often a beloved character will receive a new Lore, and fans will be very upset that a certain aspect of them was changed.  Riot, somehow, cut out an aspect that was absolutely core to the champion!  How could they?  Except, often...it was never present in the canon Lore to begin with.\r\n\r\nLet&#039;s use Zed as an example.  A lot of people are big Zed fans, and I&#039;ve seen them cite his relationship with Syndra as something that humanizes him.  Except...that&#039;s not canon.  Zed and Syndra have never even so much as met in the official lore.  It springs from an extremely popular fan comic.  \r\n\r\nEspecially with characters that came out in Seasons 2 and 3, after the JoJ ended but before the launch of the new Lore content, you often had a page long biography for a character, and that was about it.  The massive League fanbase was often forced to sort of fill in the blanks.  Over time, and through countless fan fictions, art, and other content, that becomes a pretty key way people see the character, and the lines between fanon and canon start to blur. So, when those fanon establishments are replaced by canon ones, it can start to look like Riot&#039;s writing over their own stuff.\r\n\r\nYou can especially see this with {{champion:67}} .  Her short lore and Judgement basically told us &quot;Dead family, wants to destroy what was responsible, vigilante&quot;.  So people filled in the blanks with &quot;Oh, so she&#039;s like Batman.&quot;  Well, not exactly.  She&#039;s more The Punisher. (i think i&#039;ve only really seen the netflix show)  \r\n\r\nThis creates a pretty damn difficult position for Narrative staff.  The direction that Riot might intend for these characters may have already been switched by fans who have sort of adopted them.  They have to make the choice of tossing some of their own plans and going with the fanon, or using their own material and risking upsetting fans who had certain ideas about how these characters work.\r\n\r\nExample, again, Viktor.  I think it&#039;s pretty obvious Riot originally wanted Viktor to be a straight villain.  Jayce&#039;s original Lore, his ability names (Death Ray), his voice over, all point to an evil cyborg overlord.  But Viktor had established a fanbase who liked him as a tragic villain, or even an anti-hero.  So, when they saw fan backlash to Viktor&#039;s villainy, his character became what it is now, which has...honestly pretty few villainous traits.  His Universe story is about him playing with an orphan.  He uses his terrifying DEATH RAY to...heat a pot of cream.  And it&#039;s pretty great, honestly.\r\n\r\nSo I&#039;d be interested in hearing, what fanon traits of your favorite champions do you think are worth keeping?  Which would you be okay with falling by the wayside?  And, sort of a pie-in-the-sky hope here, but if any Reds want to respond about their position on preserving fanon VS establishing canon, I&#039;d be pretty damn pleased.\r\n\r\nAnyway, that&#039;s enough out of me.","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2017-11-15T21:20:20.562+0000","up_votes":40,"down_votes":1,"body":"I have complicated feelings about fanon vs canon.\n\nNow on the one hand, once a character is released to people, it's not really 'yours' any more - it lives on (if you're lucky) in the minds of the people who expend energy to imagine it.  It can go on to have a far richer existence in the daydreams, fan art, and fan fiction than any one (or small group of) creators could ever manage.\n\nHowever, potentially that's a LOT of fanon - and it may vary WILDLY from community to community, from region to region.  I'm pretty sure we could find groups of players who (because of so many gaps in the canon) have created very different fanons around a champ - probably fanons that conflict and clash irreconcilably.  Simple version - I bet there are groups who have 'shipped just about every champ with every other champ.  Most of these would clash (we've seen, in other communities, ship fights, after all).\n\nThis can mean, unfortunately, that what is obviously the fanon about one champ, might be horribly jarring to another group of players (who may never have read a fan comic, or read a fan theory, or been following an RP Tumblr account).\n\nWhich could put us in a tricky position.\n\nI'm not saying that Rioters ignore fanon (they are fans too, ofc.) but that they need to tread carefully around what is 'canon' (i.e. every player has had an equal opportunity to experience it) and what is a shared, but unevenly distributed, belief.\n\nIt can be very difficult to know if a piece of fanon is true not just on the NA Boards, but is true in Turkey, Brazil, China, Korea, Norway, Russia, YouTube, WeiBo, Twitter, Jane/John Doe's secret erotic fan fiction journal, or anywhere else.","replies":[{"poster":"Malicious Metal","date":"2017-11-15T22:06:12.740+0000","up_votes":40,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't tell me my fanon that Morde secretly has a prized collection of teacups and enjoys baking in his pastime isn't going to be featured in his updated lore.","replies":[{"poster":"Blood Magicks","date":"2017-11-15T22:08:43.880+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":0,"body":"My fanon it's that it a collection of iron teapots, because, you know, he's a giant teapot.\n","replies":[{"poster":"SpecterVonBaren","date":"2017-11-16T00:57:06.954+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm a Little Teapot Mordekaiser skin for April 1st.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Velzard of Koz","date":"2017-11-16T00:26:04.398+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"I thought he liked to collect rings until some Yordles stole them and casted them into a vulcano.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Dessem","date":"2017-11-15T22:54:44.484+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":">  Jane/John Doe's secret erotic fan fiction journal\n\nLink?

I think what I want is not really a champion thing but a regional one. For this I will talk mainly about Demacia.\n\nWe know Demacia is the region of Runeterra that harkens back to medieval times. You have knights, kings, towns of peasants, terrible magic that should be obliterated, etc. But what I believe is an important aspect about it that hasn't been really delved into would be the sexism.\n\nNow I get most of this from Fiora's lore, But her being the head of a house is unheard of and she is looked down on for it. My interpretation of this is that this medieval region still has old sexist views. You can see a bit of this is Lux's lore on how she is told to go everywhere and has no real independence of her own, and a slight bit in how the Demacians treated Shyvana but that one is lax because she is a magic being to begin with.\n\nWhy have Demacia sexist? What does that add to the lore of Runeterra? Well foils and literary diversity. Let's start with the foil bit first though. Demacia Vs Noxus is the biggest rivalry in league, they are meant to be foils of each other by a literary standpoint. One is expansive, one insular; one hates magic, one praises it; etc. One of the biggest selling points of Noxus is their acceptance of all people so long as they can hold their own and produce results. The best foil for that is to have Demacia be bigoted people like they already are with magic.\n\nLiterary diversity: None of the league regions deal at all with the issue of gender. We have power (noxus), ideology  (freljord), conservation (ionia with the vastayan albeit a bit of a stretch), and Corruption  (Icathia and the void) but nothing that really explores the gender disparity that existed in the medieval times and still exist in degrees today. \n\nHaving a sexist nation, especially having it be Demacia, is such a good opportunity for Riot to delve deep into actual social problems.","replies":[{"poster":"Arakadia","date":"2017-11-15T23:08:31.086+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"What's interesting is that if you go north to the Freljord you see a lot of fierce, determined women leading the biggest tribes in a civil war.

Riot's task with him is very tricky but can offer great rewards. It's difficult because of the immense amount of culture behind the myth they have to respect but not copy (because we're talking Saunguimancy here, not vampirism). It can be very rewarding because Blood Magic is a fresh new fantasy concept, and Riot has already willingly or not set the standards for it. Every other Blood Sorcerer in contemporary fantasy is portrayed with white hair and/or a red cloak, and thrives near war and bloodshed . Riot has a chance to set standards further and write the newest chapter in the history of a trope that will outlive League and probably most of us. \n\n**To put it simply, Riot can make it so that every future bloodmage is seen as a Vlad knockoff.**\n\nThat said here's the Vlad fanon we seem to mostly agree on:\n\n* References vampires without being a vampire, but instead a living human who has come to possess incredible power.\n\n* Merciless, power-hungry, struggles to see people as anything more than meat/vessels for his sorcery, which is what lead to his failure to fit into society at a younger age.\n\n* Various aspects of the \"mad, bad and dangerous to know\" depraved nobleman trope that inspired the first literary vampire (did you know that Lord Byron was the first vampire inspiration, rather than Vlad Tepes?).   \n\n* Actually an intelligent, serious and terrifying character rather than a joke.\n\nThis is pretty bare bones and I'm pretty sure Riot already has it in mind.","replies":[{"poster":"Craft Zeppelin","date":"2017-11-18T06:40:00.025+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually I think the best part of Vlad's lore is that he \"Inherits\" all knowledge from his ancestors.\nWhich can mean, he can know stuff that is older than Noxus itself.\n...Like no wonder you will get a high seat.","replies":[{"poster":"Blood Magicks","date":"2017-11-18T13:27:02.661+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wholeheartedly agree.

Only now we know she's psycho murder Huntress and not awesome duo with the Question Huntress. \n\nAs to Viktor, I think his problem was that when they released his lore they failed to have him do anything actually villainous.  Like, if he was supposed to be a villain, but they show him moving past his desire for revenge and gave him a goal that could be interpreted as helping humanity.  Now, I think we were supposed to take the glorious revolution as disgusting and immoral because it forsakes a part of life that is so essentially human.  However, the transhumanist/posthumanist movement is a thing, and while I disagree with a few of their beliefs they're not evil.  Viktor was ultimately written like a posthumanist hero, but the writers' own biases on what a villainous goal was made Riot think he was a villain.  Which becomes clear when Jayce's lore is revealed and Viktor basically got turned into a generic supervillain for the hero to beat up.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Valeckserai","date":"2017-11-15T23:56:16.558+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"As an aspiring writer, I am very biased on my opinion, but here it is. Fannon is a natural occurrence and is fine, but should NEVER have any real affect on the actual lore. If a character is written in a certain way in the lore, and cannon is established on something, that's it, it's done, move along. If you disagree on something, or don't like something, that is entirely up to you, you are not obligated to enjoy or approve of every piece of lore that is put out. However, you need to respect the fact that that is now cannon. For me personally, one instance of new lore that I don't like is Orianna. I LOVED her old lore. A robot that was a replacement for a human child that was trying her hardest to be the perfect daughter/human but was constantly falling short of her goal because in the end she was still just a machine, was one of the coolest lores that Rito had ever put out in my opinion. While her new lore isn't bad... it just doesn't have that same feeling to it (plus it decannonized that amazing vo). I'm not anywhere as interested in new Ori lore as old. But as sad as I am, I respect the writer's decision to take the character this way. \n\nWhenever I'm writing a character,  they're my creation, something that I've spent countless hours pondering over, fleshing out every possible area of their existence, even in areas that will probably never see any space on the page. While others are free to interpret what they read as they will, or even fantasize about what could have been if something had happened differently, it doesn't change the objective facts about the work. I know my characters better than the people reading my works, and if my experience is anything like other writers', the same is probably true of Riot writers and league characters. Want to write a fanfiction based on your interpretation of a character? Fine, it's great that you like the lore enough to have it inspire you to create something. Want to debate about grey matters in lore such as Demacia vs. Noxus? Absolutely wonderful. However, if you want to complain that your fannon isn't getting cannonized, I'm going to have a problem with that. \n\nImagine being at your work, doing your job, and a swarm of customers is around you, all shouting out for you to do the job the way they want it. Some have good ideas, but differ vastly from what you're trying to accomplish, and others have ideas that are simply wrong and will make the finished work much worse overall. As a writer, at the end of the day, I would much rather have put out my own work that I created from scratch, and take pride in the fact that there are some people out there that admire my creation for what it is, and not just what everyone else wanted it to be. \n\nWow, that ended up being way longer than I intended. Don't think a lot of people agree with me on this one, but as a writer, I feel passionately about this topic so I decided to share.","replies":[{"poster":"LordHippoman","date":"2017-11-16T00:23:16.551+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I certainly understand how you feel, and I don't think you're wrong at all.  Your post brings up a lot of really good points. In a perfect world, yes, it's going to be the artist's choice.  However, Riot is a business, and the main goal of Lore is, at the end of the day, to help sell their products.  The scenario you described with a lot of yelling customers is sort of the environment Narrative is in, because of the very nature of these Boards we're posting on now.\n\nDo they cater to the fan desires because that's where the money is?  Or do they try to stick to the original intentions because that's how the \"art\" works?  Honestly, probably neither of those, because it's a very multifaceted issue.  Taking too many fan suggestions turns into a Too Many Cooks problem rapidly, while ignoring all feedback leaves you tone-deaf as to how the audience is perceiving your work.  It's a very complex topic, which is sort of why I wanted to hear thoughts on it.\n\n(Also, minor note, not to get all spelling-anal retentive on you, but fanon/canon only has one N at the start.

I think it&amp;#039;s pretty obvious Riot originally wanted Viktor to be a straight villain.  Jayce&amp;#039;s original Lore, his ability names (Death Ray), his voice over, all point to an evil cyborg overlord.  But Viktor had established a fanbase who liked him as a tragic villain, or even an anti-hero.  So, when they saw fan backlash to Viktor&amp;#039;s villainy, his character became what it is now, which has...honestly pretty few villainous traits.  His Universe story is about him playing with an orphan.  He uses his terrifying DEATH RAY to...heat a pot of cream.  And it&amp;#039;s pretty great, honestly.\n\nWell I mean, you give the champion a sad story, it's hard NOT to humanize them. I feel like thresh is just a psychopath. His lore tells us, he was tortured by magic which eventually grew into his personality and made him who he is today; An undead abomination who loves to torture people.\n\nGangplank, now that's a villain. Graves is a good villain too. People who let their desires for something; Power, money, love, etc. drown their sense of morality become good villains because even though they're people, we see them as monsters, not people.\n\nNoxus; is it evil, or just a regular empire? Demacian propaganda would have you believe anything but the latter. In truth, Noxus is a place where talent is allowed to thrive.\n\nor at least, that's my opinion on it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PopePancake","date":"2017-11-16T17:29:17.930+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:45}} {{champion:117}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"ReisenTheDos","date":"2017-11-16T17:23:51.875+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm upset that when Vi first appear in League, it punched a hole on a lot of potential ships Caitlyn could have had fanon wise, with the exception of Jayce.
