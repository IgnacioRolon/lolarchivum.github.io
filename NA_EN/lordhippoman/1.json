He wants freedom and the chance to stop what he considers an oppressive system.  His hate has just been boiling, and it's justified.  He's also hinted to have saved Azir or another Shuriman noble's life, for no reward, and mentions Azir having \"blood on his hands\".  Welcome back motivation for Xerath!\n\nAzir though, really thought he was doing good.  And my favorite line is when he refers to Xerath as \"his boundsman, his magus, his friend\".  Azir not only trusted Xerath, he thought he was his friend.  That's a connection that hurts to be severed, and we even learn that Azir had a family, a pregnant wife, a son,  and a daughter, who died in the blast.  Now we know why Azir was so stricken by Sivir.  Maybe family resemblance reminds him of the loved ones he lost when Shurima fell.\n\nThese are really akin to the old League Judgements in that they tell us why the characters do what they do.  If these stories were released with the Shurima Event, i think the reaction would have been much more positive.  I don't agree that the IOW and Summoners should have gone, but this is a step in the right direction.  Excited to see where the story goes with the serial lores Carnival Knights mentioned.\n\nI know a lot of you are pretty angry with the Lore lately, but you should give these a read.  I really liked them.","replies":[{"poster":"kitcat300","date":"2014-10-18T01:00:28.551+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah, unfortunately due to some sort of tech issue, they couldn't be posted the way they wanted.

It's just that it doesn't sound like the old Xerath. Old Xerath was obsessed with raw magic through and through. New Xerath was looking for freedom. It seems to me Riot will just retcon characters and replace them with new ones if it fits their story better. It started with Trundle, now Xerath has joined him as well.** I can't invest in a lore where the writers will just replace characters whenever it suits them**, because in one year, Xerath could be retconned again to be obsessed with political power instead of magic/freedom. It doesn't build any trust with me if characters are just carelessly replaced.\n\n**Edit:** Read an amazing post in a different thread by Valaran Nara (random player). Realised that unlike Trundle, Xerath is almost the exact same character with only a different theme. Instead of a magic theme he now has a slavery theme. He became a tad more evil in addition, but his character is the same aside from that. There is yet hope, now if only Riot would go back to Trundle and make him Trundle again...","replies":[{"poster":"RiotJaredan","date":"2014-10-20T21:19:07.042+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":10,"body":"The story, *Unbound*, is a key moment in Xerath's life, one that shows him at a certain point in his arc, not who he had been at every point of his life.

He knew more about the Ascension ritual, what was needed to disrupt it and the power that resulted from it than anyone else at that time. That didn't happen overnight, and it didn't just happen through the course of revenge. \n\nXerath's rise was self-made, not just through his involvement with Azir as a child—and how that elevated him from his low position—but also from his own aptitude and ability to gain knowledge that was lost to virtually everyone else. An understanding he sought while under the true and perceived boundaries of his station within Shurima.\n\nXerath's drive to gain magical power and knowledge are implied within the piece, but *Unbound* is focused on the moment that irrevocably changed Xerath, Azir and Shurima, as well as where the magus was in his mind at that time.","replies":[{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2014-10-20T23:09:01.837+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":2,"body":"Old Xerath is implied absolutely nowhere.

Even then, old Xerath was all about his path to unlimited magical power, and the steps he would take in order to get there.

These were parts of Xerath's old character, but I didn't think they were the most important part of his character; it seemed, to me, that everything about Xerath was his desire for magical power. He cares about freedom because the sarcophagus was blocking his path to power, and the fridging was a tragic result of that power, but I still felt his story focused entirely upon that path. \n\nWhile there are aspects of old Xerath in the new lore piece, if you told me they were two different characters, I wouldn't think one was particularly similar to the other, especially from the limited amount of lore we have from both of them.","replies":[{"poster":"Strident","date":"2014-10-21T00:35:19.813+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":5,"body":"To put it plainly, the endless thirst for power is merely a superficial trait, that is, in fact, shared between new and old Xerath.

It's not a means to and end or anything else. Musicians often talk about making music for themselves and not for any audience. There are people who use rocket cars just to set speed records, and try to surpass them again. There is a movement called transhumanism - folks seeking to be more than what we are (whether or not it's needed or will succeed is not relevant). Why can't a mage seek knowledge and control of power for simple drive of doing so?\n\nMy issue with the change is it makes Xerath a genocidal maniac. You say he wasn't human before, but blowing up his town in an accident (humans are imperfect after all, everyone can relate...) while following his quest for mastery of a subject vs killing everyone in Shurima for reasons that the victims won't even know? Freeing the slaves by unbinding their mortal coils? He knows it will all end in horrific destruction and that's just insanity.

While the prince was falling in love and starting a family, Xerath schemed to sabotage the ceremony to finally gain his freedom.*\"\n\nIt's not perfect, I'll admit.

His present day existence resonates more with old Xerath. I would also mention that this story gave you a glimpse of what xerath was like right before he underwent ascension and does not speak to his person after that. His ascension was not a normal one. We still don't know ho much his mind was affected during and after his change.\n\nIf what you are concerned about is the fact that his new lore does not have him fervently seeking out sources of magic to forcibly ascend into a greater being... I still think this story touches on that. He obviously did not just wake up one morning knowing exactly how to sabotage the ascension ritual. he actively sought to improve his knowledge of magic in order to put his plan in motion.

If you take Riven and take out her motivation, which is to reform Noxus, to substitute it with something else, like honing her sword skills to make Noxus greater, you get a whole different character. Motivations are a core part of the character. Look at Graves, his only major characterization is actually his will to settle things with Twisted Fate. If you changed that, you'd have another character.\nChanging the focus from \"achievement of true magic and knowledge beyond any limit\" to \"taking revenge on someone and ascending just to spite him\" is no minor step. It's a huge one. I don't say the latter can't be a good story, I'm saying it's not a *Magus Ascendant* story, the focus is on a totally different note. Old Xerath was so fascinated with the arcane to kinda be oblivious of other things, like his own real desires, which he only too late realized were tied to human feelings he would lose pushing his magic further. His tragic loss of what he sought caused by his own mistake, pushed him beyond the no-return point and completed his growth into a Magus Ascendant who completely embraced the arcane and got his humanity consumed by it, reaching a different state of existence which enables him to \"see the forces which hold the universe together\" and go beyond human comprehension.\nIt's just a different theme from the new Xerath's one and for the *Magus Ascendant* character of the game the old theme was more befitting and coherent.\nLet's put it this way: if you didn't know anything about old Xerath and his kit and quotes in-game, what would you expect him to be about after reading *Unbound*? Would you expect him to brag about him being true magic and unlimited power?\n\n> I would also like to propose a question to you.

His lore after his ascension was merely to describe why he looked the way he did in game and why he went to the league. We don't even know if he even reached his goal of reaching ultimate awareness once he ascended. we don't even find out if ascending was actually necessary to reach his goal. In fact... the whole ascension part of his story was to make it easier to understand why he looked the way he did in game.\n\nIt is not all that surprising why his story was rewritten to how it is now if you look at it that way.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Earl Eulrich","date":"2014-10-20T21:29:46.603+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"well, noone can read that out of what we have so far - so either release the whole story once in a while, or bear the utter disappointment of quite a lot of people that once loved the Lore of Runeterra.\nOn all criticism it´s always \"you don´t know the whole story\" - and that´s exactly the problem, we have just no story anymore, just a few tiny fragments...and a lot of emptiness.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ShadowKnight1224","date":"2014-10-20T21:29:36.986+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"I feel this is a problem with the way Narrative is doing things right now:\n\nThere have been a lot of posts from Narrative where they tell us that \"this is just a moment in the character's life, don't extrapolate too much from it\", all right, that makes perfect sense.

Crucial moments in particular, while they make for very interesting (if shallow) storytelling, are some of the worst moments to judge a character from.

He was definitely someone who gained great knowledge of Shurima's power. He knew more about the Ascension ritual, what was needed to disrupt it and the power that resulted from it than anyone else at that time. That didn't happen overnight, and it didn't just happen through the course of revenge. \n> \n> Xerath's rise was self-made, not just through his involvement with Azir as a child—and how that elevated him from his low position—but also from his own aptitude and ability to gain knowledge that was lost to virtually everyone else. An understanding he sought while under the true and perceived boundaries of his station within Shurima.\n> \n> Xerath's drive to gain magical power and knowledge are implied within the piece, but *Unbound* is focused on the moment that irrevocably changed Xerath, Azir and Shurima, as well as where the magus was in his mind at that time.\n\nBut that piece of story should be the one players enticed by the in-client abstract read to get an idea of the character. From *Unbound*, I'd expect more of a Spartacus (in spirit) than a *Magus Ascendant*. Magic and wizardry are only on the background, Xerath could have been easily a mere secretary in the story and physically shove aside Azir as in the facebook images Riot published, the story would have gone the same.\nThere's no perception of Xerath as a powerful mage, nor any real stressed magic-related merit in his ascension. He is not the mage who went beyond what all other Shuriman mages did he once was, he is someone who had the time and patience to go dig up ancient knowledge. One doesn't need to be a mage to do so, he could've been a librarian and that would've made just as much sense.\nFocusing the whole piece on \"freedom\" rather than Xerath's drive for the arcane just leaves one wondering why in-game his quotes should all be about power and \"the will of man unbound by flesh\".\nIn the piece, which should be the one introducing new players to the characters, Xerath is never presented as someone who wants to ascend because he feels constrained by his mortal condition and is willing to become true unlimited magical power. He is presented as a slave who feels wronged by his master and thus seeks vengeance in the most spiting of ways, opting for a genocide in the process which just makes him inhuman because of the complete lack of any thought towards other fellow slaves who will die because of him.\nI can't feel him delivering on the *Magus Ascendant* fantasy, his most prominent traits in this story, which should be the one showcasing him to new players (I like to point this out), are scheming and vengeance, he thus treads into Swain's territory for the first part and into many other's for the latter (Tryndamere, Graves...), without hitting his own niche.\n\nThis is only my humble opinion and I would be most delighted to read yours regarding this.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Dotintheparadox","date":"2014-10-19T05:36:04.945+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"How did Xerath vaporize Azir's family despite being nearly immediately sealed in a tomb?\n\nAnd saying it was the ascension itself doesn't work, because then the same thing would've happened to Azir's body, so he couldn't have even been revived, ever.

Sivir is descended from a family that was utterly wiped out. How is that possible? With no hints at all to even just guide speculation, it's just a plot hole. Why do we need a mystery in this story? What purpose does it serve? We can speculate all we want, but that won't add to the story. Not knowing how it happened doesn't add any meaningful intrigue in this situation as it's so binary. Either Sivir exists because someone survived to carry on the bloodline, or this is a plot hole. There's no mystery here. Why does Sivir need to be related to Azir by blood if it opens up a plot hole like this?\n\nTo me, the best mysteries are ones that give you subtle hints and indications of motives or how events happened. We see a jilted lover or a man with nothing to lose. We see that something has happened, but don't have an explanation yet, but we do have 'clues' to go on. \nThe mystery in this story is 'How is there a descendent without someone to descend from.' \n     Barring a magical deus ex machina (which isn't always a bad thing), the only way is that someone else survived with royal blood. That's not a mystery. That's logic. Why not let us know that someone survived, but not tell us who it is or why they were out of the city at the time? Have them sigh wistfully looking back at the city as it blows up, but then keep walking into the desert. That's a mystery then, and not an impossible happenstance.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Jingerbeardman","date":"2014-10-23T03:57:43.106+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"You saying it is impossible for her to be of azirs bloodline would mean you have insider knowledge on her story? not likely.\n\nRather than thumb your nose at everything, actually talk about how she could be from azirs bloodline.

It's not mysterious. What would make it mysterious is if someone was mentioned to be a lover of Azir, or a related person whose motivations for being absent from the city during the Ritual are 'mysterious.' Until a detail to attach speculation on is given to us, it's fruitless to speculate in my view. \n\nAgain, I like mysteries. I like most of the rest of the story given to us.
