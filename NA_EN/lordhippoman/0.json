{"poster":"LordHippoman","date":"2018-01-23T22:52:47.687+0000","title":"An Analysis Of Swain's Soul Fragmenting Lines","subforum":"Story, Art, & Sound","up_votes":36,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there.  Swain&#039;s been a longtime favorite champion of mine, and his new voice lines upon pulling a Soul Fragment from an enemy champion seem...absolutely chock full of Lore and hinting.  I&#039;ve made a quick list here, along with my thoughts, and while this certainly doesn&#039;t cover everything, nor am I a Riot Employee, I hope I can shed some light on what some of these quotes might be alluding to.\n\nThe video I&#039;m using for reference is SkinSpotlights &quot;Swain Special Interactions&quot;, which you can watch for yourself here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaGaqTW6QPQ\n\nI&#039;m not going to talk about all of them, some seem self explanatory, and the VA is pretty great so I&#039;d recommend checking it out.\n\n{{champion:38}} &quot;So he&#039;s heard the rumors.  The girl who came back.&quot;\n\nWow we&#039;re IMMEDIATELY at the line that made me want to do this, huh?  So, a long time ago, in the JoJ, Malzahar threw Kassadin&#039;s daughter into the Void.  A popular fan-theory for an upcoming champion was Kassadin&#039;s daughter, somehow Void-touched.  \n\nI&#039;m not saying this confirms we&#039;ll see her again, in champion or Lore form.  I am saying that I really really hope it happens.\n\n{{champion:22}} &quot;She claimed it was the Frost Queen&#039;s Grave.  They believed her.&quot;\n\nAshe&#039;s bow is that of Avarosa, one of the original queens of the Freljord, and Ashe is very much related to Avarosa, which is what gives her a lot of her political clout.  Swain could be implying a lot here.  Could Avarosa still be alive?  Or maybe the bow wasn&#039;t hers at all, and Ashe is faking her relation to the Frost Queen?  Lots of ambiguity.\n\nEDIT: A lot of people think this quote has to do with Lissandra, another \"Frost Queen\" who faked her own death centuries ago, but continues operating in secret by killing the leaders of the Frostguard and taking their place.  If that's what Ashe is lying about, she may know what Lissandra's up to.  Why might she be concealing that information?\n\n{{champion:41}} (And other Bilgewater Champs): &quot;They fight the Mist above the seas.  Never looking beneath.&quot;\n\nThe Harrowing invasions of the Shadow Isles carried by the Black Mist are a constant threat to Bilgewater. (See Shadow and Fortune) By &quot;beneath&quot;, however, we can assume something might be going on under the island.  Nagakaborous is the first thing that springs to mind, but I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if this went in an &quot;undersea eldritch monsters&quot; direction.  Nautilus might know something about that.\n\n{{champion:164}} : &quot;My my, does your dear grandniece know what &quot;C&quot; has been up to?&quot;\n\nThis seems pretty simple at first blush, &quot;C&quot; is an old rival of Caitlyn&#039;s, Camille&#039;s actions are often somewhat...legally questionable. ~~ Seems they&#039;re related.~~  However, there&#039;s nothing saying &quot;C&quot; isn&#039;t a somewhat infamous figure in Piltover, especially among the police.  This could even refer to Vi.\n\nEdit: This one's my bad, I forgot that Camille's grandniece is an identified character in her backstory. Whoops.  No secret lineages here.\n\n{{champion:69}} : &quot;The payment for her suffering in Shurima.  A black rose.&quot;\n\nThe Black Rose is LeBlanc&#039;s shady Noxian government manipulating cult.  Cassiopeia was cursed in a Shuriman tomb (thus the snake form) back during Azir&#039;s release event.  It&#039;s struck quite a few people as weird that the &quot;punishment&quot; of the curse is a snake form, when the Shurimans seemed to be rather fond of human/animal hybrid bodies with the Ascended.  It&#039;s quite possible things were going to be much worse before the Black Rose intervened, which would involve Cass owing them a favor.  Not a great place to be.\n\n{{champion:122}} : \"No daughters.  Only soldiers.\"\n\n(I already posted this in TheWhirligigSaw's thread, so I'm going to copy/paste here):\n\nAt the end of the comic, Quill's second-in-command, Invetia, stabs and kills her. This is probably noteworthy because Invetia and Quill's names are both listed on the Trade Map released with the Piltover Update, and they have the same last name.\n\nSo it's likely that Invetia is Quill's daughter, and given the fact that Quill was involved with Darius...he might be Invetia's father. He watched her stab her mother, valuing Noxus over any family ties. She's a soldier now, not a daughter, and he knows it.\n\n{{champion:114}} &quot;She spurned so many suitors...a wonder they did not see why.&quot;\n\nFiora is a woman of high standing in a traditionally very patriarchal society.  It makes sense that she would want to avoid marriage, to keep her family power firmly in her own hands, and not those of a husband who might muck it up.  This could also imply that Fiora simply isn&#039;t interested in men.\n\n{{champion:23}} (And other Freljordians): &quot;They squabble as the winds howl and the wards fade.&quot;\n\nLong ago, the Watchers, a group of Very Evil Eyeball Monsters, were defeated and sealed in the Howling Abyss.  While the Freljordian Civil War between Ashe and Sejuani rages, Lissandra has been working behind the scenes to free her ancient masters.  According to Swain, it sounds like she&#039;s making progress.\n\n{{champion:86}} : &quot;Ignorant of the very magic you carry into battle.  How Demacian.&quot;\n\nGaren&#039;s armor is likely made of Petricite, the anti-magic ore that Demacia uses because man, they hate wizards.  It could be referring to Petricite as a form of magic of its own.  However, it&#039;s worth noting that Garen&#039;s sister had a natural aptitude for magic, and if that&#039;s a family trait...maybe there&#039;s something more to that Giant Sword From The Sky he seems to keep dropping.\n\n{{champion:59}} : &quot;His blood is the only useful thing about him.&quot;\n\nNot only is this a sick burn, to be frank, the revival of Sion required some of a Jarvan&#039;s blood.  I guess we know who they got it from.\n\n{{champion:222}} : &quot;Faces...fading in the flames...it was all her fault.&quot;\n\nWe know Jinx is an orphan, or at least that her family isn&#039;t in the picture.  We also know that she&#039;s a bit of a pyromaniac, and that something drove her to insanity.  She might be a monster of her own creation.\n\n{{champion:55}} : &quot;He asked her to do what she could not.  Kill me.&quot;\n\nKatarina&#039;s father, Marcus Du Couteau, was a big deal in the old lore.  He had gone missing, following a meeting with Swain, and Kat was very suspicious of him.  Some of that might be carrying through, and perhaps Marcus managed to get a message to his daughter before his disappearance.  Or death.  Still unclear.\n\n{{champion:141}} &quot;A child who had known only hate confuses it for love.&quot;\n\nWe know Kayn has an...odd relationship with his mentor, Zed.  He seems to look up to him as family, but also harbors an urge to kill him and become the Master of Shadows.  This isn&#039;t really new information, I just like the way Swain phrases it.\n\n{{champion:99}} &quot;Which is the greater tragedy, that she fell in battle, or that she fell in line?&quot;\n\nThis one...confuses me a little.  I assume this quote is referring to Lux herself, with the &quot;falling in line&quot; bit being her agreeing to hide her magic powers and serve Demacia, despite their hatred of her kind.  It also echoes back to the old Lore version of Lux, where it&#039;s implied she (and other Demacians in training) were beaten and abused until they swore complete loyalty.  ~~&quot;Falling in battle&quot;, however, isn&#039;t something Lux has done yet.  Perhaps this quote refers to Mama Crownguard?  Maybe she was a mage as well.~~\n\nEdit: As Interlocutioner mentions below, these quotes are meant to play when collecting the Soul Fragments of dead champions, not grabbing CC'd ones.  So she has fallen in battle, just then.  Swain's team killed her.\n\n{{champion:92}} &quot;She held their hands as they died, hoping they would drag her with them.&quot;\n\nRiven is a veteran of the Ionian Wars, and the only survivor of her group of soldiers.  If old Lore still holds up here, they were killed by friendly fire, a chemical bomb launched by Singed, leaving Riven despondent and questioning her purpose.  She wishes she was dead.  Again, not super new, but some great phrasing.\n\n{{champion:120}} &quot;A King remains in the Mist.  And another marches.&quot;\n\nThe Ruined King still sits in the center of the ~~Blessed~~ Shadow Isles.  Who exactly is this second one Swain refers to?  Could a foreign king be planning to invade the Isles, like Demacia?  Or maybe one of the Isles champs has some conquering aspirations of their own.  If so, I think we might be seeing a lot more Morde in the future, coming to reclaim his homeland from the Noxians.\n\n{{champion:50}} &quot;I already knew that.&quot;\n\nthis one is just really good okay don&#039;t judge me\n\n{{champion:421}} (and other Voidborn): &quot;A pattern.  Spreading.  It has learned to be alive.&quot;\n\nVoid Invasions aren&#039;t a new concept, but I&#039;m interested in what this implies for the Void as a whole.  Could it be a hive mind?\n\n{{champion:19}} &quot;She was closer than he realized.&quot;\n\nSomeone, a &quot;she&quot;, was important to Warwick, and perhaps still is.  It&#039;s really anyone&#039;s guess as to who that could be, but Jinx and Vi seem likely candidates.\n\n\n\nThere is a LOT more to unravel here, especially in some of his taunts, but this post is dragging on long enough.  If you&#039;ve got any other thoughts you&#039;d like to share or that you think I missed, feel free to comment.\n\nalso holy shit Riot thanks for the lore-bomb here, I&#039;m very pleased with this VO.","replies":[{"poster":"Interlocutioner","date":"2018-01-24T00:19:46.614+0000","up_votes":46,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey LordHippoman, the SkinSpotlights video is a tad misleading.

Lots of ambiguity.\n\nI don't think this is that ambiguous. If Ashe believed Avarosa was the Frost Queen, she was completely wrong. We know this to be Lissandra's self given title, because she owns the Frost Queen's Claim. If Ashe assumed that the grave where Avarosa was buried was also shared by her sisters, then she was also wrong because Lissandra is very much alive. I think this line ties in a lot more with Lissandra and her misdirections through history than with Ashe and Avarosa.\n\n> {{champion:164}} : \"My my, does your dear grandniece know what \"C\" has been up to?\"\n> \n> This seems pretty simple at first blush, \"C\" is an old rival of Caitlyn's, Camille's actions are often somewhat...legally questionable.

In Camille's lore stories, she is the head of her household, and she is grooming her beloved grandniece to be the next head. For obvious reasons, her beloved grandniece doesn't know about Camille's side work of hunting and killing those who would endanger or oppose her family, and I can imagine that it would shatter the poor girl to know what her grandaunt is up to. This is what Swain refers to, not Caitlyn or the police of Piltover.\n\n> \n> {{champion:69}} : \"The payment for her suffering in Shurima.

It's quite possible things were going to be much worse before the Black Rose intervened, which would involve Cass owing them a favor.  Not a great place to be.\n\nCassiopeia's transformation was the reverse of the other Ascended. Her bottom half became half beast, and not her top half. It's also very incomplete when compared to Nasus and Renekton.\nThat being said, I don't think that Cassiopeia owes any favors to the Black Rose, nor do I think they intervened with her curse. What we know of the Black Rose comes heavily from Elise's story. In that story, we know they take in the master manipulators and the dispossessed of Noxus. They sought out Elise after she murdered her husband after he afflicted her with a grotesque poison, and it was among their ranks that Elise felt comfortable enough to go around without her grisly face veiled. This would imply that Black Rose MUST have other members who are working from the shadows not only because of their skills at manipulations, but also because they're otherwise hideous or too disfigured operate openly in public.\nCue Cassiopeia. She, like Elise before LeBlanc gave her the knowledge to become beautiful through Vilemaw, is hideous and disfigured by Noxian standards. She's also one of the most skill manipulators in higher society, which would make her a very prime candidate to join the Black Rose. I think this is what that line implies.\n\n> \n> {{champion:23}} (And other Freljordians): \"They squabble as the winds howl and the wards fade.\"\n> \n> Long ago, the Watchers, a group of Very Evil Eyeball Monsters, were defeated and sealed in the Howling Abyss.  While the Freljordian Civil War between Ashe and Sejuani rages, Lissandra has been working behind the scenes to free her ancient masters.  According to Swain, it sounds like she's making progress.\n\nThis doesn't refer to Lissandra at all. It actually ties in to Ornn. In the set of fairy tales that came along with Ornn, there was a story about a trio of sisters who conquered these vile creatures and sunk them into the Howling Abyss. They begged Ornn to build a bridge over the abyss to act as a seal to bind the creatures in the depths forever. Ornn agreed, and built them a bridge. However, in the story, he gets EXTREMELY upset when the sisters weave together a spell on the bridge to act as an additional seal, gruffly lamenting that magic will corrode his work and eventually cause his seal to fail altogether. This is what Swain refers to, the ancient magic that the sisters enacted on his perfect bridge that is wearing it away.\n\n> \n> {{champion:55}} : \"He asked her to do what she could not.

Some of that might be carrying through, and perhaps Marcus managed to get a message to his daughter before his disappearance.  Or death.  Still unclear.\n\nIf you had read ahead in the video, you come to where he taunts Katrina. He asks her if they have located her father's killer, or if they still blame him. This is Swain's way of telling us that some other force in Noxus is responsible for the death of Du Couteau, and that Katarina's mission to kill him was shortsighted and misguided.\n\n> \n> {{champion:99}} \"Which is the greater tragedy, that she fell in battle, or that she fell in line?&amp;quot;\n> \n> This one...confuses me a little.

Perhaps this quote refers to Mama Crownguard?  Maybe she was a mage as well.\n\nThis is incorrect. You gain the Soul Fragments primarily from killing enemy champions, and by landing your W and snatching CC'd enemies with your passive. This line is a direct reference to Lux being killed in game and he gaining her soul fragment from it, hence the \"fall in battle.\"\n\n> {{champion:421}} (and other Voidborn): \"A pattern.

Could it be a hive mind?\n\nI doubt it's a hive mind. I think he's referring to the Void space as a whole. Canonically, it's a bunch of chaotic mess between dimensions with imperceivable shape, form, and function. It has a tendency to seep into other dimensions when breaches occur. I think Swain is noting that the breaches are occurring more often and more regularly, and that the creatures that are manifesting from the Void are taking on very living qualities that they probably don't have in their native dimension.\n\n> \n> {{champion:19}} \"She was closer than he realized.\"> \n> Someone, a \"she,\" was important to Warwick, and perhaps still is.  It's really anyone's guess as to who that could be, but Jinx and Vi seem likely candidates.\n\nWhy on earth would they be the most likely candidates? The only connections they have to Warwick is that they all hail from Zaun. That's it. The champion this most likely refers to is Soraka, with whom he's had connections with in the past lore, and who's lore, along with Singed's, was conspicuously not updated when Warwick got his update.","replies":[{"poster":"Jerry SeinfeId","date":"2018-01-24T17:08:06.656+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:164}} \nWhy else would he refer to \"C\", which is cait's nemesis.\n\n{{champion:19}} \nHe has lines like \"You were there\" and \"the fear in your eyes, i've seen it before\" towards jinx and vi implying a relationship/connection.\nSinged is his current creator and no longer his apprentice.
