{"poster":"LordHippoman","date":"2016-10-09T20:37:02.355+0000","title":"Request for a Sticky Topic to Make Finding New Lore Easier  @Riot","subforum":"Story, Art, & Sound","up_votes":20,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there, I&#039;m someone who frequents these boards, and I&#039;ve noticed a very common thread of discussion.  A lot of players come asking about where to find the updated bios for champions like Twisted Fate, since their clients don&#039;t have it.  Or people want to read the diary that came out with Rek&#039;sai, or Ekko&#039;s &quot;Seconds&quot; comic.  Some posters come confused on why they can only find the short form Bios for new champions like Aurelion Sol or Taliyah.\n\nEvery time this happens, we really only have two options.  We can tell them that the full Lores are now located under the website&#039;s &quot;Champions&quot; tab, but that&#039;s not always accurate, as things like the aforementioned comic aren&#039;t on their champ&#039;s page.  In that case, we have to hunt down the link to that page, which can often prove to be a hassle, since they have often long since been shuffled off the main page of the site.  I remember the last time I found Rek&#039;sai&#039;s diary, I had to use a link to the Chinese LoL webpage, because I couldn&#039;t find the NA or EU one, and the poster asking for it was NA.\n\nI&#039;ve been a Lore fan my entire LoL career,  (Season 1 vet, still don&#039;t know how to jungle!) and I think a lot of the best Lore we&#039;ve had has come out recently, with the likes of full stories like Shadow &amp; Fortune, Burning Tides, and Bloodline.  However, it is often difficult for players to find, and that disappoints me, because it feels like a missed opportunity to introduce curious newcomers to Lore.  I&#039;d like to see a way to make this content easier to access.\n\nWhile I realize that a fully updated and working hub page for Lore is something that could take a long time to get working, I&#039;d like to advocate for a bit of a stopgap mechanism.  The old Lore Discussion forums had a stickied topic, curated by user Sylph, called &quot;The Chamber Of Antiquity&quot;, which held links to all of the Lore beyond Champion Bios.  This made looking up things like Judgements and old JoJ articles easy, and I still use it today.  \n\nI&#039;d really like to see a stickied topic in the same vein on these new boards.  We already have two very informative discussions by Sharjo pinned, and I think that proves how useful they can be.  \n\n**A post that simply contained links to things like champ release teasers, event pages, and other difficult to find content could be immensely helpful both in reducing the confusion new readers have trying to find them, and making it easy for veterans to revisit and cite for discussions and such.**\n\n Something as simple in layout as: &quot;Shadow Isles Event Page: 2015: http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/site/shadow-and-fortune/ \" could help soothe a lot of questions.\n\nOf course, this is just my suggestion, but I&#039;ve seen a lot of topics over the past year or so about this issue, and posted in a few myself.  It&#039;s a frequent topic in our community, and I believe that this could be a potential solution.  I&#039;d be glad to hunt down links to contribute, and I&#039;m sure several other posters would as well.\n\nThat&#039;s all I have to say, here&#039;s a picture of Tahm Kench. {{champion:223}}\n\nEDIT: Well, we have it.  Both Tattersail and Sharjo wrote topics along these lines.  Sharjo's topic is now stickied, presumably thanks to Bioluminescence.

A lot of people wanted Riot to talk more, so he tried appearing randomly saying hi, dropping little teases, or explaining a few questions.  He slowed down a bit now.  I don't know if it is because he's busier, distracted, or the full on drive to personally take time out of his day to say hello waned a bit.  I don't blame him for the last part purely because not everyone stays motivated on hings that aren't \"necessary\" (and I mean that as in, do it or else necessary)","replies":[{"poster":"Sharjo","date":"2016-10-10T18:44:32.585+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Jaredan was actually on holiday with his family up until recently for a good while, considering he'd been working for a good solid two years with no real breaks.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TyrekGoldenspear","date":"2016-10-10T00:18:27.687+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh man, i didnt know they actually had a head of the lore team!\n\nI didn't mean it like that i assure you.\n\nWell in that case at least make him a red and a high ranking member of the lore team.","replies":[{"poster":"Valaran Nara","date":"2016-10-10T00:21:15.672+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=TyrekGoldenspear,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=YbMxoEG5,comment-id=00000000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2016-10-10T00:18:27.687+0000)\n>\n> Oh man, i didnt know they actually had a head of the lore team!\n> \n> I didn&#x27;t mean it like that i assure you.\n> \n> Well in that case at least make him a red and a high ranking member of the lore team.\n\nWe need find someone to draw a Riot Badge for Sharjo.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Aeszarck","date":"2016-10-10T01:59:48.589+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Sharjo,realm=EUW,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=YbMxoEG5,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-10-09T20:50:29.427+0000)\n>\n> I mean I can try and make an FAQ to help the process if people would wanna see it, though I can&#x27;t guarantee such a thread would be stickied.

If there were more people around things would be probably be done better, but you gotta do with what you have. I personally think the lore part is handled as best as it can during this old to new transitional period.
