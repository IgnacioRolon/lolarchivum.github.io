An unstable or poor connection to the matchmaking service can definitely cause you to be kicked out, and if you disconnect from the game platform entirely it can crash your client and kick you back to the desktop. I can definitely second going through the connection guide to see if any of those steps can resolve this issue for you. \n\nIf you still see these issues after working through that guide, let me know.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kürama","date":"2016-08-03T23:46:44.743+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Disconnects in champ select are likely due to an unstable connection with the LoL servers. \n\n[Troubleshoot your connectivity issues.](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues)\n\n\nhttp://na.leagueoflegends.com/sites/default/files/styles/scale_xlarge/public/upload/su16_keyart_1920x1080_0.jpg?itok=6nj8mHjj","replies":[{"poster":"Black Pöwer","date":"2016-08-04T00:06:20.582+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay, I can understand the whole unstable connection thing but it didn't receive any on screen message saying I've disconnected from the pvp net; the client literally freezes and puts me back on the home page. This has never happened prior to today and I've already repaired the client twice. The only thing I can compare it to from the list of things on the troubleshoot list would be \"You never reach champion select after queuing with your friends, even if they do\" but I do reach champ select, it's just been freezing and kicking me out","replies":[{"poster":"Kürama","date":"2016-08-04T00:10:40.048+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Freezing in champ select then returning the home page is usually a result of a failure to establish a stable connection to the servers. Champ Select in all modes requires a more steady connection than the home page which is why it's more vulnerable to disconnect there. \n\nThere were also some sever stability issues earlier Today which have been resolved, this could have been related to your disconnects. If you're still experiencing disconnects however, I highly recommend performing the steps listed in the guide I linked you.","replies":[{"poster":"Black Pöwer","date":"2016-08-08T10:50:25.845+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Update**\nHasn't happened since I posted this and just wanting to clarify that it wasn't kicking me back to my desktop, it was kicking me back to the home page in client but making me unable to join Q's so making me having to restart client etc. Anyway, none of this matters now; I'm on leaver buster restrictions because of something out of my control, guess I just have to wait it out.","replies":[{"poster":"Kürama","date":"2016-08-08T21:06:50.419+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was referring to the home page in the League client. :D\n\nIf you experience any issues in the future, don't hesitate to contact us!","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
