I had a game where the enemy Ryze was doing poorly and when I clicked on him he only had in the region of 800 mana at level 8 - I start the game with 800 mana. You would probably need to make the scalings scale so that people who already start the game with 400 bonus mana aren't buffed, assuming you keep the bonus ratios proportional late game. Alternatively, you could just stick a \"your maximum mana is increased by X / Y / Z%\" on his ultimate so that even if his ratios are poor - his mana pool improves. \n\nP.S. I think making his mana costs proportional to his base mana would be a lot fairer. At the moment you _need_ mana to actually afford using his rotations - which basically just makes him double-snowball from one stat. Or he needs some innate mana restoration in his kit.","replies":[{"poster":"Beoridas","date":"2015-08-18T12:37:50.419+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i dont feel there is that much difference for him. total mana and bonus mana doesnt make that much difference in dmg since the scaling is low. and he gets a tear pretty fast too.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MealReadytoEat","date":"2015-08-18T03:53:02.487+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hasn't Ryze more or less fallen off the pro scene though?

I have around a 60% winrate with him. but these are mainly accumulated from old ryze, and buffed new ryze. I doubt anyone has 125+ games just on one patch with only one champ. If anyone has, its a very very small strick minority (even the pros thinks hes weak--it was mentioned in LCS by team owners and shoutcasters on LCS today and will be picked in very very specific situations)\n\nI feel that whats gathered on champion gg is from total performance: take my data as a whole. and my win rate is quite low since the nerfs even tho i have a lot of games with him and a strong win rate. Admittedly im no master tier however.\nHis laning is strong, mid game horrible, late game good. Sort of very odd for him historically.\nWhat are the ideas on the table if I may ask? \n\nMay i suggest anything?","replies":[]},{"poster":"TerraRising","date":"2015-08-16T23:56:50.507+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RiotScruffy,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=6OPm1Awn,comment-id=0008,timestamp=2015-08-16T21:34:27.524+0000)\n>** We're slowly working on some changes that will hopefully shorten the gap in success between an insanely top tier ryze player and everyone else.** Probably still a few patches out though.\n\nSo... are we finally getting rid of that whole \"This is what separates the good (champion) players from the great (champion) players\" nonsense?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Beddlam","date":"2015-08-18T12:43:32.422+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"One option that I think might be worth trying on Ryze is switching his shield to his R and his spellvamp to his passive. One of the reasons I think Ryze is much weaker in the hands of less experienced players after the latest nerfs is that he is extremely vulnerable if he isn't ready for the fight. When stacks lasted for 12 seconds, it was fairly easy to always have a stack or two up, so if you got jumped on you could turn and fight. Now not only does it take more aware gameplay to keep a stacks on yourself, it also takes much more mana. This means if post-nerf Ryze get surprised, he is realistically going to need 3-4 seconds to get into his passive, more than that if he is kiting out of the range of his E. Adding the shield to his ultimate combined with the speed boost already there would give him a more dependable escape tool, with the obvious downsides of burning his ultimate and still being very vulnerable to cc. The spell-vamp on his passive would retain some of his early trading power while making him even more vulnerable to cc during his passive up-time. It would also give him more sustain in lane which would be balanced early by his mana-hungry nature.\n\nAnother thing to look at that might help less experienced players without being a major power boost to master Ryze players would be to make his farm better, either by giving him more AD/faster AA animation or by giving him some mana return on his Q for last hits.","replies":[]}]}
