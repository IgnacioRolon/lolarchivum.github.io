I didn't have this problem before but this just started. Turning the software mouse button off does fx the problem but I can't play without the software mouse button. Everything just seems very slow and different. Is there a solution to this problem?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-13T21:25:13.373+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You probably need to adjust the mouse settings through the mac os options to get that weird mouse stuttering figured out. Go ahead and try resetting your config settings for League to make sure something in there isn't affecting your mouse though just to be safe.\n\n- Log into the game client\n- Navigate to your League installation\n- Delete the folder named **Config**\n- Go into a practice game and verify that settings have saved properly. \n- Leave game to sync settings","replies":[]}]}
