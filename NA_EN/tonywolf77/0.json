Looking back at League&#039;s older and even the original animations that came with the game, I have to say that the level of progress in terms of storytelling and animation quality is phenomenal. If there&#039;s one thing I can say I have always been satisfied with and pleasantly surprised by, it&#039;s 100% the animations and the quality and depth they bring to Runeterra. \r\n\r\nSpecifically speaking, the newest Ryze animation was pretty good, I enjoyed it myself and it definitely met the standard of previous works, my only nitpick being that in the scene just before Ryze teleports into the sanctuary, he brushes some leaves off of a stone carving; they sounded kind of glassy and inorganic to me despite being _leaves_ so it caused a bit of mental discord for me, confusion between what I heard and what I saw. \r\n\r\nI can&#039;t wait to see what Riot has in store next, and just thinking about it makes me super excited.","replies":[{"poster":"Garentheon","date":"2018-07-26T17:54:00.991+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It’s becasu they were dead dry leaves.
