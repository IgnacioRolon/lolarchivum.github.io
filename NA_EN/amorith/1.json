Same thing goes for heimer mains, a champion that is considered niche and unplayable, his winrate is higher than anyone elses right now, at 54% and Quinn at 53%. Irelia is broken as all fuck right now, but still remains at a 50% winrate barely.\r\n\r\nSo stop trying to make this argument with me, it&#039;s really annoying.","replies":[]}
