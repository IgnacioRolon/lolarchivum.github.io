This is not the same as burning bridges, because if I was, I would be severing my connection to them. I still play the game, so learn do me a favor and learn how to use phrases correctly.","replies":[{"poster":"HalcyonDweller","date":"2018-06-26T16:13:54.724+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"https://pics.me.me/uh-phrasing-29888004.png\n\nI understand the phrasing perfectly well. If you bothered to try to understand what I meant then you'd get the point of it, but you're not even trying. Short of actually trying to understand, at least lay off the insults. I haven't made personal attacks against you here, I'd appreciate if you showed me the same courtesy.\n\nSome of the players here on the boards have worked very hard to foster an environment where Rioters will come and participate in discussions with us. When you make personal attacks against Rioters, you're making them feel less welcome here. They then stop coming to the boards and thus they stop reading the posts by the rest of us who care about sharing ideas with Riot. You're driving away Rioters who would otherwise stay and read posts from other users.\n\nIt's actually a lot like burning bridges. And they aren't your bridges to burn. Other people worked very hard to fix them. So fucking stop. It's easy enough to complain about changes without wishing cancer or unemployment on the person who chose to make those changes.\n\n","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"GayFluffyUnicorn","date":"2018-06-25T22:41:51.787+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah let's not bash the people responsible. \nLet's bash merkel or trump for the state of league. \nCould have also been Bill gates.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"wildfox99","date":"2018-06-26T06:19:28.635+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"now i know people will hate me for that,but a nice example of your argument is Rickless'\n\nhe donesn't know anything about this game and ends up messing up everything he touches","replies":[]},{"poster":"Janakin","date":"2018-06-25T19:55:02.883+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"The statement is true.

Which is why when it comes to gaming, most game designers do play their games. They just don’t play them on the highest level. \n\nThis is reminding me of the cuphead problem where people started thinking you cannot be a game journalist if you’re bad at a game. I don’t agree, I can be terrible at Dark Souls (and I am) but I can point out how well it rewards the players for learning the tactics from trial and error. \n\nKnowing how to use your product helps you in making and designing it, but you don’t need to be a master at using it to be the designer. You don’t ignore the swords from the blacksmith just because he’s not a master swordsman.","replies":[{"poster":"chipndip1","date":"2018-06-26T02:18:41.851+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"But in Ghostcrawler's case we're going to make this thread to tell him to eat a worm.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
