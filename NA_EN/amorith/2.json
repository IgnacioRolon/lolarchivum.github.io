Easy fix.\n\nThat isn't fixing anything, now you just have people pissed that someone going out of their way to ruin the game gets away scot free while they are punished. Also, how is the system supposed to know about the last three directly?\n\nThere is a reason why the latter 3 take longer to get punished, because it isn't as simple as catching someone clearly trying to sabotage with their words, afkers do eventually get punished, as do int feeders, but sabotaging is rather difficult thing to define. Do you consider someone who goes 0/5/0 sabotaging? If so, what are the circumstances because EVERYONE has games like that, I don't care who you are, there have been games where YOU are the one feeding but it isn't intentional, maybe you are getting camped, maybe your brain refuses to operate, or something just happens and you end up as the dead weight, should you be banned for a bad game?\n\nPeople just naturally do have bad games, and the sooner you realize that, the sooner you will stop flaming, hell, what even is the point of flaming, what does flaming actually get you? Does it make your allies play better, no. Does it make you win, no. Then why not simply not say anything and just play?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Shukr4n","date":"2018-06-10T05:08:17.576+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"As.i stated, toxic players stay toxic.\nSadly thaty are shameless and dont quit the game .
