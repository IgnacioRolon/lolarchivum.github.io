If you're not challenger, if you're not playing in the upper echelon, you're unfit to discuss balance.  Based on Challenger rank, Akali isn't an issue.  You're not a challenger, and sorry buddy butm, you have no idea what you are discussing.

It is why the communitycomplains whenever Zed or an assassin is buffed.  They do not see that the buffs are meant to help champions who genuinely are having difficulties and encounter viability issues.\nYou balance around the highest level of play because attempting to balance around the lowest levels of play is beyond difficult at best.","replies":[]},{"poster":"marpatt11","date":"2018-07-17T06:14:10.890+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=VermillionWolf,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=AecXzhlE,comment-id=0003000000000000,timestamp=2018-07-17T01:26:59.733+0000)\n>\n> Hope you know most league players are in bronze to gold so balancing around challenger thoughts is not exactly the best idea.
