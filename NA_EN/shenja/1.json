Depends on the type though. Healer/Tank/CC I divide them into three categories, most champions fit into multiple but its easier to track this way. \nFor a tank, it is in your best interest to either block stuns or projectiles and go all in after the enemy fails to attack your adc. \nA healer needs strong mana regen and CDR to keep everyone alive. Focus on this first and you can build whats fine with you.\nCC for sure needs CDR, but its not about landing stuns, its about where and when. Enemy in the bush? Useless stun less you ward it.\n\nThis is basic stuff and it all branches out but if you have anything else to ask just message me\nDiscord : Jyugo","replies":[]},{"poster":"Elvishwarrior","date":"2016-12-19T10:58:48.291+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Add me!\nIGN:Elvishwarrior\nDiscord:Elvishwarrior\nSkype:NathanaelOrosco1995\n\n may be able to help you out, my support only got me to like silver 3. But I am pretty sure you want to know just enough to be good at the position?\n\nEither way there are alot of things you need to learn in terms of being support, and I dont really agree that you have to know how to adc, you just need to understand whats the adc's duty, and what you need to do exactly in terms of your current team comp and the enemy team comp.\n\nBut Major things to learn are Vision Control, Peel for your adc, and using certain abilities to your advantage like Heals, Pulls, Engage/Disengage, CC, etc...\n\nI got placed in bronze after my placement games this season and should be back in silver in a week, so if you want to duo I can show you alot, And it doesn't even have to be ranked we can just do normal games, just be sure to add me in game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"EXE FallenKnight","date":"2016-12-19T05:20:13.868+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"a (non support focused tip) for when you play ranked. Mute Anyone and everyone at the start of the game. If you are a competitive person you will already be kicking yourself for making mistakes or forgetting something, you dont need your \"teammates\" kicking you for it too. I dont support but I find that the games I mute everyone I focus better and I can recover from bad plays or mistakes easier, but when I dont mute people and they start to flame me its harder to recover and get back to playing well. Its also a good tactic if you plan on playing multiple games in a row, it helps prevent you from \"tilting\" and carrying over a bad performance/mood into your next games.

Also just because you can ADC doesn't make you a good support. You must know your role (duties). I suggest Taric in ARAM to up your skills. If you like to 5v5 then try Soraka. Sona can go AP/support (a long time ago I hope she's still good) on 3v3. Co-op vs AI is not the way to go if you're trying to learn how to support. Try jumping into ranked and support 100%. DGAF on what people say about your skill (the team will either blame support or jungle for failure). Most importantly you give vision for your ADC to not get ganked and fall behind.

I got to LVL 30 like 2 months ago and i tried ranked supp and i accidentally died and my adc was like gg zilean fed 1 kill early. and also stuff like do you even know how to supp, and like where was my heal. It pisses me of so much because I;m trying to get better but their words discourage me. But that you for your help xD","replies":[]}]}]}
