The IP I used to buy them is used too. Can you guys tell me what I can do about this?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-13T21:00:24.125+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see where you bought some glyphs back on 7/10, and they are sitting in your inventory. I'm wondering if Lew might be right and that you have your filter on so that those runes aren't showing, so double check that first. If that's not the case, try to grab a quick screenshot of your runes so I can see what might be going wrong.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lew","date":"2017-07-13T06:05:11.105+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You probably have the runes filtered, click the list icon near the magnifying glass when you are looking at rune pages and make sure you have all the tiers checked.","replies":[]}]}
