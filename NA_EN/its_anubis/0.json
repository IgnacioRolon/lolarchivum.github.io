My displeasure is this; Before 15 minutes Yasuo has 100% crit chance with only a Static Shiv and a Cloak of Agility, and then there is the fun little thing about how he has 97% Armor Penetration after he ults if he has the maseries and a Last Whisper(or upgraded version). Now I understand that sometimes things slip through during the Pre-Season changes, but I seriously fail to see how somebody did not notice these very impactful issues. How do you deal with a Yasuo that has 100% crit and can basically deal True damage???? Anyone have any thoughts on this?","replies":[{"poster":"Sehlikah","date":"2015-11-16T19:56:46.117+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Was Riot aware that crit-using melee carries would be outliers before they shipped the patch?

True data for nerfing Yasuo, if such a nerf is necessary (though it will likely be needed), will only be collected after the hotfix.\n\nhonestly its not the mastery on yas thats the problem its that he has way too much power far too early. even if all you have is a cloak of agility and a brawlers glove you still have 60-62% crit chance. That's only the cost of a Zeal atm.","replies":[{"poster":"Sehlikah","date":"2015-11-16T20:21:53.342+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Warlord's Bloodlust is actually a massive component of Yasuo's overwhelming power.  He acquires massive sustain without building any lifesteal.  So, at a SS and an IE, this mastery basically gives Yasuo 50%+ of a lifesteal item.\n\nWith just a Zeal, Yasuo has a reliable way to heal off of minion waves.  This means that he can force a trade, and heal off the damage he took.\n\nDoes Yasuo synergize with the item changes too much?  Probably/definitely.  However, it's hard to say how much while Warlord's Bloodlust exists.\n\nI do not disagree that Yasuo probably taps into too much power too soon; however, I believe you underestimate the impact of the mastery.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Andrionar","date":"2015-11-16T19:54:21.499+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Warlords bloodlust masterie will be nerfed to the ground in patch 5.23.
