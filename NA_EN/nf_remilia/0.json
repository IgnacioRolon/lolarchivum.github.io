I got into bronze 2 thats fine because i didnt played much in s9 and my mmr was bad.\r\nI went 7-3 there as support. Thats fine , then i went on 80% winrate skiping ranks and everythign all the way to gold 3 was about to skip to gold 1 because my mmr was super high , i was getting matched with high plat , low diamond when i was in silver 1.\r\nThen somehow the system decided ok he had enough fun. \r\nAnd start matching me with players that has no clue what they are doing.... I got matched few times with adcs that has below 100 farm at 20mins... WHAT... \r\non top of that today i got matched with zed that has 30 farm at 12 mins... 30 farm WHAT? ... and i had Garen on my team that had no clue what to build to he bought black cleaver and Trinity force.... >.> He said that he just want to play 3 ranked games for a mission...\r\nHow i can drop from low diamond mmr to people that has 30farm at 12mins...\r\nand ofc my winrate suffer now. Because from 80% winrate in diamond mmr i dropped to below 60% winrate at now im getting matched with gold and low plat players.... like cmon man , am i mad ? yes i am... because i worked hard to get my mmr that high but suddenly and somehow my mmr got destroyed by the system and now im playing with people that face checking and has below 5cs per min... thats disgusting..","replies":[]}
