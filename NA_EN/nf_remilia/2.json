I had 4 games with afk players.\r\nDoes the afk players population increase? XD\r\nAnd they are not a dc or something they are rage quiting , saying ok im done with this game ...going on main acc and stuff like this. \r\n\r\nPlease dont ragequit and leave your team 4v5  :)","replies":[{"poster":"Nightsky Pirate","date":"2020-01-25T00:34:43.787+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"When AFKs are this rampant...\n\nNow understand that I don't think Riot is doing the best they can, and I only say it because this is gonna sound very defensive of Riot. I want change. So...\n\nI think Riot needs to blame the players. The system tolerates afk, and for good reason. We, the community of League, is attributed by some as the worst among the online games. The community needs to change its attitude. Standards have to improve.\n\nThey aren't quitting playing League, the AFKers are quitting with the players in that match.\n\nNow I'm not saying you're the problem, but are you doing all you can to encourage your allies to play it through the bad lane phase?\n\nUntil you can honestly say you're doing your part... asking players to not AFK is actually borderline going to make it worse.","replies":[{"poster":"NF Remilia","date":"2020-01-25T08:42:14.464+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey man,\nYes i do actually. When we losing i always say \"dont worry team we can comeback\" , \"its ok we will comeback\" . \"Well done team\" im not toxic at all , but some people just randomly ragequitting. You can check even my youtube channel and see how im texting to my teams i always give words of encouragment. \nThe other thing is.  I made this post not to blame the system , system is good. I wanted to reach to people and tell them to not leave their team 4v5 :[","replies":[{"poster":"Nightsky Pirate","date":"2020-01-25T08:56:00.134+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good to hear! Honestly, we need a ton more of that attitude.\n\nStill- I don't think it is criticism - \"don't ragequit\", but it _sounds like it_. I think a much more constructive suggestion is in order, and one that doesn't come off as selfish at all.\n\n\"I know it's lame to have been rocked and things aren't going well now, but maybe we can make it up for you. Won't it feel good to wipe the floor with that smug mastery-spamming laner? Even if we don't win, let's at least deny him a good K/D/A.\"\n\nThat's just off the top of my head. Of course that's not something to drawl out in game, but since we're on the forums, we can afford a lot more encouraging things to say than \"please don't be mad and make us sad\".\n{{champion:99}}","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"lavidaloca46","date":"2020-01-26T15:47:34.045+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just had 3 afkers , rage quit and went afk. and you give them 10 minute punish for waiting and i get account permanently banned for flaming them when they left.
