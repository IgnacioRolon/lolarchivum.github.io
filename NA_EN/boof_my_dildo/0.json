The thing is though... the way the Instant Feedback System works, it doesn't ask \"Does this chat warrant a ban?\"  It asks \"Does this chat warrant a punishment?\"  If the answer is yes, then the player is issued with the next punishment in the punishment tier list.  There are four of them.\n\n1.  10 game chat restriction\n2. 25 game chat restriction\n3. 14 day temporary suspension\n4. permanent suspension\n\nSo, if a player has had no prior punishments, but they get reported enough times that the system decides they deserve punishment, they will be issued the first punishment.  If they are already at one of the other tiers, then they will move up to the next higher tier, which means even relatively mild logs can result in a permanent suspension, if a player has shown to be consistently toxic.  (Note, if a player is extremely toxic, they can skip tiers and be escalated directly to one of the suspensions.)\n\nNow, one final thing to point out.  The report system is actually set up so that premade groups cannot abuse it.  Even if all 4 of them reported you in each of the 3 matches, it doesn't count the same as having 12 reports from 12 different matches.  While their reports would have flagged the matches for review by the system, if the system did not find anything inappropriate in them, the reports would be found invalid, and no punishment would be issued.","replies":[{"poster":"Boof My Dildo","date":"2017-01-11T00:21:25.337+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thanks for the info","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-01-11T00:00:03.489+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"You chat way too much.
