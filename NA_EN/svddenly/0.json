(Can't happen more than once every 6 seconds)\n\n*Q:* **Manafire-** (Toggle) When Manafire is active, Delirus oozes a pool of unstable mana from his body that deals 15/30/45/60/75 (+.2 AP) (+3.5% of Delirus's current mana) each second and slows enemies in the pool by 10% (+1% for every 200 maximum mana); slow persists for 1 second after leaving the pool.\nRange: 250; Mana Cost: 11 mana per second; Cooldown: 1 second\n\n*W:* **Supercharge-** Delirus charges an allied champion with some of his power, which shields them by 80/110/140/170/200 (+.3 AP) (+4% of Delirus's maximum mana) for 3 seconds, restores 5% of their missing mana +9/18/27/36/45 over 3 seconds, and boosts their movespeed by 75 for 3 seconds. Delirus may target himself, but he gains no mana.\nRange: 700; Mana Cost: 85 mana; Cooldown: 15/14/13/12/11 seconds\n\n*E:* **Power Punch-** Delirus empowers his next attack (lasts 5 seconds) with his mana causing it to deal 90/120/150/180/210 (+.3 AP) (+7% of Delirus's current mana) magic damage and stunning the enemy hit for 1 second, then silencing them for 1 second. If no enemy is attacked then Delirus expends 5% of his maximum mana.\nMana Cost: 50/60/70/80/90 mana; Cooldown: 8 seconds (Begins after an enemy is hit or the spell fizzles)\n\n*R:* **Resounding Energy-** (1st Cast: Battery Charge) Delirus draws in all resources (Mana, Energy, Fury, etc.) expended within 1250 units of him for 5 seconds. Once Delirus has charged his battery he may cast Resounding Energy again (Maximum Charge: 300/600/900). (2nd Cast: Resounding Energy) All of Delirus's battery explodes outward dealing magic damage equal to two-thirds (2/3) of the total charge of the battery (Maximum Base Damage: 200/400/600) plus 25% of his ability power and 10% of his maximum mana. All enemies hit by the blast are slowed by 60% for 2 seconds.\nRange: 600; Mana Cost (2nd use only): 100/115/130 mana; Cooldown (Begins after 2nd use): 85/75/65 seconds\n\n***\n\n*Lore: Delirus was a scientist from Zaun working with other scientists to unlock the secrets of an ancient stone that generated energy who was betrayed by the other scientists and was tricked into being in the same room as the stone when the others were observing the results of prolonged exposure to it. However, they did not anticipate what happened next: the stone exploded. When the others rushed into the remnants of the room, they did not find the stone or Delirus's remains. They did find an odd puddle of glowing blue liquid. The puddle then took a human shape (or as close as it could get to one), and attacked the scientists.* **(Work In Progress)**","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-03-15T00:21:04.656+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Derek, I'm glad to see this champ get a second chance in the spotlight.
