I tried manually clicking shop as well, both resulted in nothing. In fact, my entire keyboard and my mouse are unresponsive in game, except for the enter button, for all the good it does. All it can do it alternate me between windowed and non windowed mode when hit. I then tried to close the game, restart my computer, and go back in, many times. Each time i do so the game stops responding. Ive restarted my computer 3 times now, run a scan to be sure there are no viruses, and I also uninstalled any program that directly impacted my game (ie razor cortex meant to help my fps). All with the same results. My game is unplayable and i dont know why","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-23T18:21:19.834+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A constant connection is required to play through a match, so it's possible that your network is losing stability and causing your game to become unresponsive.  As a first step, I suggest going over the instructions in our[ connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to get your network running smoothly.

However, after uninstalling and reinstalling the game my issue seems to be resolved, if it happens again i would be happy to look further into the issue with you, thank you","replies":[]}]}]}
