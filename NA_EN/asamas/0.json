This is way i love them as a champion(I am a big fen of the cool concepts). I had awlyas called them &quot;they&quot; but everyone is saying &quot;she&quot;. I know it looks like the Labm is the main but please respect the concept. \nThank you for reading this. If you have any reasons why Kindred is &quot;she&quot; the tell me.","replies":[{"poster":"Eye of Twilight","date":"2017-01-12T09:51:48.666+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, the _concept_ of the Kindred suggests that we should use they/them, but the gameplay suggests she/her. In my opinion, Riot didn't deliver very well on the Kindred's concept in game. I wish they would have done a toggle system to switch between Lamb and Wolf or that Wolf was more involved with the attacks and movements of the champion. It was really a missed opportunity to make a very unique champion design.","replies":[{"poster":"Rito Staff","date":"2017-01-12T12:44:09.459+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pretty much yeh. I think Riot fails a bit on champion theme delivery. What is Yorick without the Myst Maiden or his corpses? Yet, his corpses are a bit too situational, so how does a Yorick fights anywhere else besides lanes when you don't have ultimate? Like a Nasus, bashing Q. Boring imo.\n\nSkaarl could also feel more of a character if we could play him. Imagine that when Kled lost the first portion of HP he would fall on the ground and be stunned indefinitely, meanwhile we would play as Skaarl instead, on a mission to wake Kled. (Like a Jak and Daxter duo kinda thing).\n\nAlso, a bit more detail reinforces duo champions idea. In DotA 2 there's Ogre Magi who is a 2 headed Ogre, in the minimap it shows 2 faces side by side.\n\nIn the minimap what do we see? Lamb face, not Wolf. Aren't they 2 parts of a whole champion?","replies":[{"poster":"Lùmen","date":"2017-01-12T14:08:52.747+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"? Kindred's icon is KINDRED.

Wolf is just a thematic addition and takes a role in 2 abilities, one of them somewhat unnoticed because of the fast animation. (E)\nI think Kindred could use a Shyvana level rework in order to make them just right.\n\nIt is also quite hard to notice that he is the one who hunts jungle camps, while Lamb looks for champions. >>","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Forbidden Siren","date":"2017-01-12T14:33:17.616+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Due to how small the icon is, both champ select, in-game map, etc. It looks like the face of Lamb with some sunlight on the mask (the Wolf side).

Yes, Kindred should be referred to as, \"they\", but because most casual players see Lamb as the primarily role when playing, they often refer to them as \"she\". I've been guilty of this myself. \n\nIt also doesn't help that each splash art, especially loading slice, tend to focus solely on Lamb too. Or the majority of the player base don't read the lore and have no idea their name are two champs in one.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Muzét","date":"2017-01-12T08:09:31.440+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Wolf is just secondary.
