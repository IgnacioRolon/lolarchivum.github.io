It's not. The word is highly controversial. Here's from the Wikipedia entry for it:\n\n>In practice, its use and meaning are heavily dependent on context.[1] Presently, the word %%%%% is used more liberally among younger members of all races and ethnicities in the United States.[2] In addition to African America, other ethnic groups have adopted the term as part of their vernacular.[3][4]\n\n>There is conflicting popular opinion on whether there is any meaningful difference between %%%%% and %%%%%% as a spoken term.[5] Many people consider the terms to be equally pejorative, and the use of %%%%% both in and outside black communities remains controversial.[6] H. Lewis Smith, author of Bury that Sucka: A Scandalous Affair with the N-word, believes that \"replacing the 'er' with an 'a' changes nothing other than the pronunciation\"[7] and the African American Registry notes, \"Brother (Brotha) and Sister (Sistah or Sista) are terms of endearment. %%%%%% was and still is a word of disrespect.\"[8] The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, a civil rights group, condemns use of both %%%%% and %%%%%%.[5]\n\n>Some African-Americans only consider %%%%% offensive when used by people of other races,[5] seeing its use outside a defined social group as an unwelcome cultural appropriation. Used by blacks, the term may indicate \"solidarity or affection\",[9] similar to the usage of the words dude, homeboy, and bro. Others consider \"%%%%%\" non-offensive except when directed from a non-African-American towards an African-American. Yet others have derided this as hypocritical and harmful, enabling white racists to use the word and confusing the issue over %%%%%%.[3]\n\nI'm not an idiot. I realize that there are uses for the word that are not intended to be racist. But I can't relate to the assumption that those uses would be clear during a game of League, or that somebody would honestly think that the questionable slang they're using in their specific neighborhood is somehow universal.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Telephone Booth","date":"2018-12-27T01:37:56.784+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=xxxoooxoxo,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=IbgoELgU,comment-id=00000000000100000000,timestamp=2018-12-24T04:12:58.149+0000)\n>\n> People at my job say it all the time? its not a racial slur; hes literally using common language, and to discriminate a POC for using a word that is used as a form of affection and greeting is entirely unethical and outright wrong. disappointing to see Riot ignore this issue.\n\nUmm theyre clearly not ignoring the issue if they issued a punishment in relation to it.
