But waiting for more than a month for the rest of Jhin&#039;s lore, but at the same time getting Targon lore and Aurelion&#039;s teaser out BEFORE THAT is starting to bug me. \r\n\r\nI understand that not every website, design, or story is perfect, and that things sometimes have to be delayed. I also understand that Riot has a lot on their plate, and that huge companies don&#039;t like putting all of their eggs in one basket. \r\n\r\nBut it seems as though there&#039;s almost every excuse in the book as to why Jhin&#039;s lore hasn&#039;t come out. He was wonderfully teased and hyped, and then died out; and from those ashes came Targon lore and a few celestial teasers. I mean, Shen&#039;s lore JUST popped in unannounced, and I wouldn&#039;t have known if I wasn&#039;t reading the story boards today! \r\n\r\nI&#039;m not the kind of player that would figuratively stand and picket at Riot as a company over something like this, but people are starting to think that Riot just... Stopped caring about Jhin&#039;s story, as an example. \r\n\r\n(Don&#039;t get me started on anything else that people say Riot stopped caring about. I&#039;m still patiently waiting for Swain to be dusted off and paid attention to! {{item:3070}} ) \r\n\r\nBut the fact that Jhin seems (keyword SEEMS) to be put to the back burner like that makes me a bit sad, not because I play him, which I do... But because I actually like seeing the community happy! It seems as though people have to pry JUST to post a vague-as-hell statement about &quot;Eventually it&#039;ll be released.&quot; People don&#039;t expect timelines and exact time frames, but... This is getting old.","replies":[{"poster":"RiotJaredan","date":"2016-03-03T20:08:29.756+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Jhin is not on the backburner, but I completely understand how it looks and the frustration it generates. We're frustrated too. THe issues that have arisen recently have shown that the system we had in place is not robust enough. With that in mind, we're looking to get Jhin out, as we did Shen, as soon as possible, and at the same time look at setting up a new process and tech to make things less prone to break.\n\nWe agree it's getting old, and we're fixing it.","replies":[{"poster":"Swainey Todd","date":"2016-03-03T20:45:12.532+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Jaredan! Thank you so much for responding! \n\nI know you guys are trying; and because I don't work at Riot or even have a tech degree, it's a bit of a challenge to wrap my head around what could possibly be the roadblock. \n\nMy fingers are crossed that it'll be out soon, and that it'll be awesome when it does! \n\nIs it too much to ask _when_ \"as soon as possible\" would be? Like, are you guys close to getting rid of the issues at hand, or will it be a while yet? I remember hearing that the story is finished and such, and that the roadblocks are, I assume, the only things stopping you guys from getting the story out.\n\nOnce again, thanks for taking the time to respond! I really appreciate it! :3","replies":[]},{"poster":"Meep Man","date":"2016-03-05T08:05:16.382+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please tell me this new tech and process will always get us every lost Shuriman lore as well.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Centuros","date":"2016-03-03T19:39:02.646+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And can they at least put links to these lores in-game?","replies":[{"poster":"Swainey Todd","date":"2016-03-03T19:58:46.551+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually had to scour the boards to even SEE Shen's lore.

Jhin JUST got released like what 2 months ago?  These champs have been around since league started pretty much and they have absolutely no lore/irrelevant lore because institute of war is no longer a thing.  Basically EVERY lore update they have done since the great Shurima ~~purge~~   update is getting priority over the ones who **STILL DON'T HAVE A STORY AFTER ALMOST 2 YEARS**.   \n\nYou had a fancy video, can you shh already?  He's literally a brand new champ and you're crying about his lore?   Man pls don't waste this boards time complaining about a champ who already has a long story on the website.  Kinda funny how quick this one got a red post tho,  very interesting xD","replies":[{"poster":"Swainey Todd","date":"2016-03-05T05:17:06.791+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ummm... Not once did I say that everyone else has fantastic lore. Of course other champions need it too. Yikes. Having such anger from a person posting about someone's lore is quite concerning! Maybe Braum could get you a glass of warm milk?\n\n(Oh. And Amumu got a \"fancy video\" too. Something about a Sad Mummy? But nah. That's not supposed to be mentioned.)","replies":[]}]}]}
