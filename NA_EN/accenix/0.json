Blatantly over powered champs are being left to crush solo queue, but hey look another akali nerf. Hec, Garen, Vi, Kai'sa, Dianna, rene, etc, have been absolutely crushing this entire season and all riot does is sit around thinking of cool new skin concepts. I stand true to the title. I'm a hundred percent confident I could balance this game better than riot itself. riot pokes over powered champs, slowly ramping up having them broken for 3-5 patches before they're balanced. Riot needs to nerf champs, big time, and slowly buff them up up. All of the champs I've listed need to get the zoe treatment. It's the best and least frusterating way to play vs or with this champ. Many have said this is the worst season of league, even worse than the dreaded 8.11. Step up your game, or watch it burn to the ground. Not that riot listens to their community anymore anyways. Gotta pad those skin sales.","replies":[]}
