One of the biggest issues with it is that it inexplicably has stats vastly different from it&#039;s components. Instead of just leaving the exact same AS, AP, and AD from it&#039;s components, it LOSES all AS and gains AD and AP. If it just kept the same stats as it&#039;s components, it would have similar gold efficiency and would still be a slow item that has to ramp up to be effective. All that would happen is it would be a tiny bit better on champions who rely on AS, aka every single champion who buys rageblade. \r\n\r\nHonestly it needs some buffs to be viable on anyone besides Kayle, but unless/until that happens, the super weird loss of AS needs to be addressed.","replies":[{"poster":"Iil vayne","date":"2016-10-15T00:34:29.679+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":23,"body":"False.
