If you're level 5 with 3 ranks of consume and their Jayce is dumpstering your Tryndamere, there's not much your build can do. Mine (dom sorc) will get at least another hundred points of damage from the dark harvest and that's frequently enough to tip a squishy matchup. See?

I never said that Nunu needed any work on Riot's part. That has not been a part of my discussion on this thread at all. You asked why people aren't taking Guardian on him. I told you. Nunu is not a Warden. He does not spend time near his allies. The area of effect for proccing Guardian is ridiculously small unless you use your buff on them. Even if you do use your buff on them, it gives you a very small shield, and Nunu is the tank that already has a larger health pool than most. Guardian is a lot better on champions with MR and armor steroids because they tend to have less health. Nunu has tons of it, he doesn't need more. \n\nIf Nunu could use Aftershock, Aftershock would be way better on him than Guardian. \n\nA lot of Guardian's power is invisible to the Nunu player. It involves shielding an ally, which is not something you're paying attention to while you're brawling on the front lines. That power is much more appreciative to a support player who is constantly watching the ally's health bar. \n\nNotice that most of this (except for the irrelevant health stacking on a champion who easily gets 5k+ health each game) has nothing to do with the POWER of the keystone. His win rate is all about the power of the keystone, the keystone selection rate has everything to do with the satisfaction the player gets out of the keystone. People who aren't choosing to support don't generally give a shit about supporting other players. I know I don't. I've said it before and I'll say it again: fuck my teammates. I play Nunu to ruin the enemy jungler's life, not to support anyone.\n\nAlso, Blood Boil has an odd interaction with Guardian because when you cast it on Nunu it seeks and targets the nearest ally champion to use it on automatically. That means you can waste your Guardian keystone without meaning to by just using an ability on yourself when you're too close to the mage who doesn't go in with you. Then you get the shield, the mage doesn't, and the keystone only provides half the power it is intended to. So it's not even that interactive or useful with the ability Nunu can use it with. \n\nAnd even after all of that, I am still not arguing for Nunu to get buffed. He needs a full rework, which should include giving him a hard crowd control ability because Riot seems convinced that you MUST be able to immobilize enemy champions if you are to be considered a \"tank\". Courage of the Colossus and Aftershock prove this.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"bywords70","date":"2017-12-13T23:30:06.457+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"they could legit double his health straight up and i still wouldn't want this troll champion on my team","replies":[]},{"poster":"muted team chat","date":"2017-12-13T18:56:05.525+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"He is a good pick in to certain matchups.
