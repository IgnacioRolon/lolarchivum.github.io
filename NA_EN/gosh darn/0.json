Her voiceactor was pretty talented, but Annie is a relic of the past back when Riot would use a couple voiceactors to voice every champion, and because of that limitation a lot of them really don&#039;t fit at all. She also looks a bit like a weird demon child with her eyes and hair. This brings me to my main point;\r\n\r\nMake ingame Annie look and sound like she does in Annie: Origins. She seems more like a little girl here, instead of a cartoonish parody of a child. Annie doesn&#039;t necessarily look horrible, but after seeing her video, it&#039;s painfully obvious that her current visuals and voice are out of place and subpar.","replies":[{"poster":"Carnival Knights","date":"2018-09-05T18:22:59.865+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":0,"body":"*whispering softly* and let me write Annie in Wonderland's vo, let me do it, hey, psssst hey","replies":[{"poster":"WiccanBKaplan","date":"2018-09-05T19:29:09.037+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Sounds like someone has a few voice line ideas..... any interesting one?","replies":[]},{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2018-09-06T16:25:07.484+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, if you need to show support from the player base to convince the power that be, you can show mine :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hexs Fortune","date":"2018-09-06T01:45:22.542+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Carnival Knights,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=WwpWrWTf,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2018-09-05T18:22:59.865+0000)\n>\n> *whispering softly* and let me write Annie in Wonderland&#x27;s vo, let me do it, hey, psssst hey\n\nYou say this only days after I rerolled an Annie un Vonderland skin shard\n\nI'm on to you {{sticker:sg-lux-2}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"QMighty","date":"2018-09-06T01:01:44.145+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Make.
