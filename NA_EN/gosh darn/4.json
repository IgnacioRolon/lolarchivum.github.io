Even against an HP tank like Mundo it&#039;s not even worth considering. It&#039;s absurdly expensive, provides no noteable powerspike, and doesn&#039;t scale with other items. It&#039;s active is very weak compared to other items such as ghostblade which in addition to having strong actives are still gold efficient. It&#039;s one of the least efficient offensive items in the entire game, coming in at a disgusting 73% gold efficiency without the passive. Even in extreme circumstances, the passive is not going to be doing enough damage to make up for the horrible stats. \n\nMost importantly, the champions who used to build this item are not as dominant as they were in this item&#039;s prime, before the nerf. It needs a reworked effect, new effect, price drop, or buff to the stats or passive. When a cookie cutter offensive item with no real niche is never purchased, it&#039;s obvious there&#039;s a huge issue with it&#039;s power or cost. It's not like a banshee's veil or Wit's end that is strong but rarely bought due to nice effects. It's an item nearly every AD champion in the game would consider buying if it wasn't so horribly overpriced. It's clear that the stats are the issue. We've gone more than an entire season without any champion even touching this item.","replies":[{"poster":"Requiemsfire","date":"2016-10-22T06:12:33.805+0000","up_votes":28,"down_votes":1,"body":"The active on blade of the ruined King isn't that weak and it feels like the main reason Vayne doesn't build BOTRK anymore is because her burst build has become a tad dominant. \n\nThat aside it's stats are a bit too much of a one size fits all providing AD, on hit damage, life steal, and attack speed on top of a movement speed steal active which is still really good for kiting.","replies":[{"poster":"Gosh Darn","date":"2016-10-22T06:27:02.243+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":5,"body":"How does that \"one size fits all\" argument work when it would be waaay more effective to buy more cost efficient items that give different stats?

It causes more problems than it solves. Don't get me wrong, I like that it's got multiple stats instead of just being a glob of AD, but the horrible gold efficiency makes it undesirable.

For instance, the first could be named Blade of the Ruined King (with the flavor text: *A gift of the King to his duel champion*), whereas the second could be called Freljordian Whaling Harpoon (flavor text: *Made for killing Leviathans*).\n\nSecondly, Vayne used to rush Blade because it had the perfect stat spread for her - mainly the AS to benefit Silver Bolts/Fervor of Battle/her AD steroid(one on the very few among ADCs)/its own on-hit and the Lifesteal to sustain her close-range combat pattern. The new build uses Warlord's Bloodlust for Lifesteal, allowing her to go for an AS/Crit item which has even more synergy with the AD steroid.","replies":[{"poster":"Samflash3","date":"2016-10-22T17:25:51.682+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What if they took a Liandry's route with Blade of the ruined King where it dealt its damage via physical damaging spells and autos but in exchange the damage is a burn effect?

Saying BoTRK doesn't scale because it doesn't have an ad ratio attached to the passive or active is lazy thinking. The passive and active themselves already scale with enemy max hp even if you don't include the many ways items can make those effects hit harder or more often.\n\n* This follows from the first point partially but BoTRK IS a niche item, not a generic damage item. It offers little ad and the lifestealing is inferior to what you'd get from most other items. What it offers is attack speed and on hit damage thaqt scales with enemy max hp. It is therefor not an item that most champions can efficiently buy and it is also an item that is most effective against tanky enemies who regen health rapidly (because by the % current health damage on autos does more damage if the enemy keeps increasing their current health). Champions who build tanky but also have auto attack resets or otherwise scale with attack speed can make good use of going botrk and full tank when facing enemy high hp regenerating tanks. It is a VERY niche item right now because it may be undertuned or it may not have common enemy to be used against in the current meta, but its still a niche item with a very specific set of champions who might use it and enemies it might be used against.
