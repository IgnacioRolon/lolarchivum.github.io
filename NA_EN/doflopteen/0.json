This only started happening a few days ago. Basically, I can hear the messages people send me in the results window, but I can't see anything but a small portion of the top-left corner of the client. Then, when I close League and open it up again, the client is smaller for some reason, so I have to change the resolution of the client almost every time I open the game. I've tried doing a full repair, but that didn't change anything. I also tried deleting the whole \"Config\" folder, then played a game, but that didn't change anything either.\r\n\r\nSo, I dunno, maybe I'm missing something super obvious, but I'd like to know if anyone is familiar with this problem and possibly knows how to fix it.","replies":[{"poster":"Dark Morgana","date":"2017-06-06T19:06:06.137+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's nice to see you tried all those steps for a fix! I would suggest at this time running a [clean reinstall](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202539040) of the client. It sounds as if some files didn't patch correctly and aren't getting fixed even with a Hextech Repair. After you run the repair, run into a custom game and win it really quick. If it happens there let me know and I will go over other solutions with you :)","replies":[{"poster":"Doflopteen","date":"2017-06-07T11:25:58.994+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay, so I just did that, then I restarted my computer and it worked for one game. I was able to see the results screen at the end of the first game, but then, after playing a second game, the client started only showing that one corner again. So I thought it was fixed for a while, but then it just went back to doing the same thing...","replies":[{"poster":"Dark Morgana","date":"2017-06-08T22:14:51.279+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm a bit late to the party! Appreciate you checking out all the steps. Since none of that worked it's time to send you over to the tech team in a [ticket.](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) From there they will investigate further into the issue and get you fixed up.","replies":[{"poster":"Doflopteen","date":"2017-06-10T06:04:31.182+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright, thanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Kristerino","date":"2017-07-25T01:38:30.951+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have the exact same problem and I can't fix it. ;(","replies":[{"poster":"Jhin on Ice","date":"2018-03-13T16:21:57.788+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its doing the same thing for me did you guys fix it?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Nigedi","date":"2017-08-25T12:58:49.830+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ihave same problem!","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
