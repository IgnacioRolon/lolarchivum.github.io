I love the slow buildup to the crazy action and the focus of making certain champs out as just crazy like how zed just goes balistic vs the 3 others. Even tho the videos always seem to come out for the \"good side\" as the victor its still awesome to watch. I've watch it multiple times because the work is just awesome. I wouldddddd like to see the bad guys win in a video in an obvious fashion, i think that would be cool. But thanks again, Awesome vid.","replies":[]},{"poster":"C4pt Chunk","date":"2015-09-12T20:14:48.374+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I gotta say I was severely disappointed that not only did Zed not laugh the whole time he wasn't fighting he didn't even laugh once!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Solidair3","date":"2015-09-11T02:45:15.498+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's a shame you couldn't get leona in!\n\nas for good parts, I really enjoyed the opening part when Fiora was helping Yi out, as well as the action parts with fiora and zed in particular.\n\ngreat job!","replies":[]},{"poster":"TerraRising","date":"2015-09-11T02:14:32.475+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=The5thSin,realm=NA,application-id=EBBIvmVK,discussion-id=liwGXeIa,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-09-11T01:39:59.236+0000)\n>\n> Thanks so much!

That was some very done, if subtle, storytelling there.\n\n>What do you think we could have done better?\n\nI really wish you had included more of Leona and Yasuo in the animation.  Two champions, one with the first new skin in over two years, and they're not in the _promotion_ video/commercial?  Really bad marketing decision there.  :/","replies":[]},{"poster":"BeatzBoyFTW","date":"2015-09-11T01:48:41.169+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mostly on the part on  Lucian vs Zed. It's like, sword fighting duel seems kind of a bore now, but when it comes to making guns vs sword(or blade, w/e) works, it's just truly epic :D","replies":[]}]}]}
