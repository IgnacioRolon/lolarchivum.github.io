Minions: Card Corrections","subforum":"Mechs vs Minions","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mr. Piddlesworth stated: later printings will have errata corrected.  I know rule books get updates all the time.  However, my question is if cards get errata corrections, will the people that bought wave 1 be able to get the updated cards?  I saw a YouTube video that said the cards might need some changes.  Example: One card at level one stated that you &quot;Must&quot; turn your Mech 90 degrees.  However, the level 2 of the same card did not state that you &quot;Must&quot; turn 90 or 180 degrees.  Also, will we get a PDF file with errata corrections for the rule book?","replies":[{"poster":"Mr Piddlesworth","date":"2016-10-15T16:43:15.962+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"The only card we've changed right now is the schematic with the right cost on one side but the wrong cost on the other. I'm sure we will update the rules pdfs for download. We haven't talked about replacement schematics... I'll bring it up with Kades Monday.","replies":[{"poster":"DarkRitual","date":"2016-10-15T17:51:28.931+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"How about getting full-scale updated card images somewhere?\nIf players use card sleeves, it's pretty easy to get blanks or use cards from elsewhere with a light amount of glue (I recommend glue-sticks, since they don't glob up like some other glues). Using card sleeves helps to to make sure the altered card doesn't stick out, while also being a good way to protect the game's cards in general.","replies":[{"poster":"Mr Piddlesworth","date":"2016-10-16T00:48:34.003+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Interesting idea.

Even the best board game companies have corrections to their games. I own Fury of Dracula and it is the 3rd edition. I had Cry Havoc preordered and I cancelled my preorder to get Mechs Vs. Minions. I was floored when I saw this game. The quality and the thought that went into this game is amazing. Riot has raised the bar so high that other board game companies are shaking in their boots. My kids are driving me crazy waiting for this game. All I can say is don't stop.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DarkRitual","date":"2016-10-16T09:43:30.400+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also a good way for players to replace damaged or lost cards, as another point of discussion for it :)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"El Paso Gaso","date":"2016-10-16T00:53:14.961+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please think about releasing updated cards in the future.  I am sure many of us would be willing to purchase updated cards and/or rule books.  Another Idea is to make a card creator program so the community can make their own cards.  Plaid Hat Games has a card creator for their game \"Dead of Winter.\"  What about expansions with more boss characters?
