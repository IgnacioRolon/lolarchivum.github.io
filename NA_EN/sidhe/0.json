Just take some of my recent games as an example. \r\n\r\n3/1/22 = A+\r\n1/0/14 = A+\r\n4/5/27 = A-. \r\n5/5/9 = B+. \r\nBut THEN.... 7/3/40 = S- \r\n\r\n\r\nI&#039;m putting down tons of wards. I&#039;m participating in team fights. I&#039;m not playing for an S. I&#039;m just playing to do whatever I can to help my team. I&#039;m rooting, I&#039;m shielding, I&#039;m saving them from dying. I got 3 of the honors in that last game on the list, probably because I kept my teammates from dying several times. But when I look at my score at the end of the game and see that I got 40 assists and then only get an S- I&#039;m in shock, my team is in shock, the enemy team is in shock. Everybody thought that was worth an S.\r\n\r\nMy crowd control score in that game was 120, almost 4 times what anyone else in the game had. My vision score was 78. I don&#039;t have a bunch of CS, but I&#039;m the support. I&#039;m not taking CS unless no one else is around. What the hell more can I do????","replies":[]}
