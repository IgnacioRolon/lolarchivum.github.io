That skin is currently on sale in the store.\n\nor\n\n2.) The champion for the skin is currently on sale in the store (this only applies if you do not own the champion already).\n\nAs of right now, Vi is currently on sale for 50% in the store, so if you do not own Vi, this would be why you cannot make the purchase. Now, you can purchase Vi for 50% off, and this should allow you to purchase the skin from the Snowdown Shop, or you can wait until she is no longer on sale to make the purchase, which would be tomorrow.","replies":[{"poster":"Røwdy","date":"2015-12-19T00:23:54.900+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh i see.
