I am sorry if that joke was not appropriate.\n\nThen as the game goes on, Diana player \"<removed by moderation>\" and Yasuo player \"<removed by moderation>\" are dying alot, which are fine, it is a normal game and I am just having fun.\n\nThen Diana, started to call me \"fucking trash jungle\", and I said \"toxic, reported\" which is aiming to stop her from flaming me.\n\nI said \"you're going to get reported\", then she said \"you too, me and my friend are going to report you\". I responded by \"why?\", she said \"because you're trash\" (I can't remember the exact conversation, please look at the chat log).\n\nAt this point, my goal was to report her and move on from this game. I was still playing my best, and Diana was still flaming me.\n\nThen, she called me a \"fat white **** kid\", and I said \"who?\" (Please look at the chat log).\n\nThen at the end of the game, me and my friend reported her and she and her friend reported me.\n\nI got banned and forced out of my queue for the next game, while she was still playing.\n\nDear Riot,\n\nI ask you to please reconsider this case. I had a 10 game and a 25 game chat restriction before, I admit I were wrong in both those cases. But this case, I do not believe I was being toxic or flaming at all, while Diana used toxic curse words, name calling, and racists terms. But I got a 14 day suspension and she gets to keep playing?\n\nThank you, I believe the wonderful people at Riot will give me justice.","replies":[{"poster":"Periscope","date":"2019-01-10T05:55:15.760+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"We donâ€™t allow naming and shaming on the boards; thus your image has been removed. \n\nIf you have any questions about this edit, feel free to reach out to us on [discuss the boards](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/community-moderation) or the moderation discord.","replies":[{"poster":"Shiwah","date":"2019-01-10T19:20:18.901+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Periscope","date":"2019-01-10T19:55:08.359+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks!","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Dynikus","date":"2019-01-10T05:33:02.726+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"yes, it was. your teammate's chatlog has literally no bearing on whether or not you get punished.

The chat is only meant to be helpful to winning, so like shot calling. Not telling others to feed and shut up, and taunting them with bans and reports\n(04:37:10 AM) IG TheSao: that was a joke...\n(04:37:12 AM) IG TheSao: please\n(04:37:21 AM) IG TheSao: you can clearly see that was a joke\n(04:37:33 AM) IG TheSao: I can't even say \"shut up\" when diana said \"fucking gank jungle?\"???\n(04:37:34 AM) Fromage: ya if someone reports you for breaking the rules and you do break the rules, you get a penalty and they can escalate if they're close enough to the last penalty\n(04:37:46 AM) Fromage: you can not respond to anything with negativity\n(04:37:51 AM) IG TheSao: the \"feed\" was a joke when the game wasn't started\n(04:38:05 AM) IG TheSao: what?\n(04:38:10 AM) IG TheSao: I get called \"shut up\" so many times\n(04:38:19 AM) Fromage: please only use the chat for its intended purpose or you will keep getting penalties\n(04:38:54 AM) IG TheSao: do you think this ban is justified?

Do you really think this is fair?\n(04:44:47 AM) IG TheSao: In real life, if someone says toxic things to you, do you run away?\n(04:44:54 AM) IG TheSao: or you can't even say \"shut up\"?\n(04:45:05 AM) IG TheSao: please\n(04:45:34 AM) IG TheSao: I was being very positive aside from that one \"shut up\" and the one \"Feed\" joke I made in the beginning of game\n(04:46:06 AM) Fromage: this isnt real life\n(04:46:08 AM) IG TheSao: I can't even make a joke now, is that the incentive riot wants the make players, to only type game-related stuff and not making a joke?\n(04:46:13 AM) Fromage: and you have agreed to follow our rules\n(04:46:26 AM) IG TheSao: you're right\n(04:46:34 AM) Fromage: I dont see much in this game that we would consider neutral and helpful to winning it\n(04:46:55 AM) Fromage: but yes, we only want game related things to win the game, so like shot calling\n(04:47:00 AM) Fromage: anything else, use a different chat\n(04:52:20 AM) Fromage: was there anything else I could answer today?\n(04:52:27 AM) IG TheSao: thank you for your answer\n(04:54:41 AM) Fromage: you're welcome, I hope you have a better rest of your night\n(04:54:58 AM) IG TheSao: Dear Riot, please take a deeper look into this case\n(04:55:50 AM) Fromage: was there anything else you wanted to review about it?\n(04:56:07 AM) IG TheSao: Can I talk to a different support member?\n(04:57:00 AM) Fromage: there wont be a different answer :/ but you can write in a new live chat if you want\n(04:57:46 AM) IG TheSao: So I have been playing this game for a long time\n(04:58:05 AM) IG TheSao: and spent a lot of money on it, do I really not deserve a second look at this case and a fair judgement?\n(04:59:19 AM) Fromage: there was a second look into it, you a re judged fairly because we hold everyone to the exact same standards, regardless of how much time or money was spent on the account since we dont give special treatment for that\n(05:00:01 AM) IG TheSao: I was not asking for a special treatment\n(05:00:27 AM) IG TheSao: I was asking for a right to defend myself from someone calling me toxic words and racist words\n(05:00:42 AM) IG TheSao: not even defending by responding with negativity\n(05:00:48 AM) IG TheSao: just the right to report him and keep playing\n(05:00:56 AM) Fromage: the best defense is to protect yourself, not be offensive back\n(05:01:08 AM) Fromage: you can of course report and keep playing\n(05:01:10 AM) IG TheSao: can you tell me which words I use do you consider offensive\n(05:01:25 AM) Fromage: enjoy your ban.\n(05:01:31 AM) IG TheSao: wow\n(05:01:41 AM) IG TheSao: that is offensive?\n(05:01:47 AM) IG TheSao: okay\n(05:02:06 AM) IG TheSao: Because when you say you hold everyone to the same standard\n(05:02:25 AM) Fromage: no one likes being told their getting banned, thats not a nice thing to say to someone\n(05:02:33 AM) IG TheSao: I did not report anyone who used \"enjoy your ban\" or \"shut up\" in basically every ranked game I played in\n(05:02:52 AM) IG TheSao: you're saying I should report them from now one, for saying \"enjoy your ban\"?\n(05:03:00 AM) IG TheSao: can you please\n(05:03:07 AM) IG TheSao: repost diana's chat?\n(05:03:09 AM) IG TheSao: to here\n(05:03:13 AM) Fromage: thats you though, not everyone is offended by the exact same things\n(05:03:22 AM) Fromage: thats why we make a blanket statement of no negativity in the chat\n(05:03:32 AM) Fromage: I will not post another players chat log\n(05:03:37 AM) IG TheSao: if you played the game you know a lot of people say those things\n(05:03:42 AM) Fromage: you are only penalized for your behavior, not anyone elses\n(05:03:55 AM) Fromage: I do and a lot of people get chat restrictions\n(05:04:15 AM) IG TheSao: you're the official\n(05:04:18 AM) IG TheSao: I can't argue with you\n(05:04:24 AM) IG TheSao: you're always right\n(05:04:25 AM) IG TheSao: :)\n(05:04:49 AM) IG TheSao: you're determined to not hear my reasoning\n(05:04:55 AM) IG TheSao: thank you for your time\n(05:05:05 AM) IG TheSao: just one last word\n(05:05:26 AM) Fromage: I understand your reasoning, I get why you said what you said, but that doesnt mean that we just let it slid and dont hold you to the same standard as everyone else\n(05:05:36 AM) IG TheSao: I have lost a lot of faith for this game now.
