I just dodged a game, not because I didn't want to play, but because I failed to close out League of Legends last night, so I didn't have the updated free to play rotation. With that in mind, I was just going to support, anyway, and I already had to champs for that, but by the time I'd made it into champion select, all the roles had been filled out, and my only choices were champions I couldn't choose. With that in mind, I don't mind the client's dodge punishment for that type of situation, I just wanted to let you know that my leaving wasn't because I didn't want to play, but because I made a mistake that may have caused us to lose the game from the beginning.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-11T16:27:49.841+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, thanks for letting us know about this.  It sucks that it resulted in a dodge, but you helped discover a pretty solid issue while the client is in testing.  If you haven't already, be sure to[ submit this bug report](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005466327) so our client devs can review it.  Thanks again!","replies":[]}]}
