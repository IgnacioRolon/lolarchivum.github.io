Games should be 20 minutes on average.  Who wants to play a 40 min game when 10- 20 mins in you know if your going to win or lose.  There are no comeback mechanics.  \n\nCommunity is toxic: \nJudging by the forums,and my games, I can tell you all know that this community is worse than any Blizz communities. Even OW wasn&#039;t this toxic.  Riot needs to clean up its player base. I find it hard to believe there is a game more toxic than this.\n\nSmurfing is out of control:\nEven Over Watch wasn&#039;t  this bad on smurfing problem.  Very obvious there isn&#039;t   a player performance MM system in place to put smurfs in the correct MMR.\n\nToo many hereos and too heavy a time investment to learn basics:\n141 hereos.  If average game is 30 mins, that means itll take you 70 hours just to play all of the heroes 1 time each( and thats assuming you get 0 early game surrenders).  Not to mention, there are a ton of runes and items in the game.  \n\n1 map\nVery boring. Makes the game seem super casual.\n\nNot enough macro play\nnot much of a team based game, team fights revolve around  the hyper carry to do work. \n\nNo come back mechanics:\nif your behind in levels, and enemy is up in structures,then you have a very high chance to lose the game.\n\npay to win\nthose who spend money to buy OP heroes have a leg up on other people.\n\n\nskins are too expensive\n30 dollar skins. wow riot, just wow.  \n\nBoring stale meta\nI did my research and asked around. There are heroes that are 2+ years without even getting touched and left to roast in the dumpster fire.  \n\nLOL is more casual than HOTS\nHOTS  has 70 heroes, 15 maps(each has its own meta), multiple talents and builds, macro  and micro play. LOL has 1 map. And each hero has 1 or 2 viable builds which you can look up online.  The game even tells you what items to buy.  \n\nAs long as you learn good micro skills, you'll climb up in ranks. Thats the only thing you have to learn (you can copy/paste builds,there are only 1 or 2 you usually have to worry about).\n\n\n\nTime to release LOL 2.0 I think. \n\nFeel free to tell me &quot;good bye&quot; , but remember this, I almost spent money on this game. And I&#039;m sure there are others that are similar to me.  You need new players to keep a game healthy.  Makes you wonder at what point RIot will be thinking of an exit strategy .\n\nI shudder to think what competitive play is like.","replies":[]}
