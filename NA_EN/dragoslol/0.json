I just noticed but I've yet to receive it yet. And I'm currently lv. 17 on a new account (not smurf, I deleted my old accounts and decided to come back to league, so made new account). Just wondering if it's still there cause it would be nice to have a lil bit of extra RP during all this Project stuff released. Thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-02T16:22:49.887+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When hextech crafting released, the RP provided for new accounts was actually replaced with a [new player chest](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/ZGErnvY4-hextech-crafting-new-player-chests-to-replace-400-rp).
