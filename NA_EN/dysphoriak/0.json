Since the latest patch, I can't login. I've gone through the checklist to make sure nothing is from there. Last night playing I noticed that whenever I entered hextech crafting my client would crash, weird but not totally crazy. Then again last night, while everyone was having issue, I went to log in and got the \"too many people trying to log in right now\" screen. After waiting I got unable to login and the general \"connection error, cannot connect to PVP.net server.\" I first repaired my client and then did a full uninstall and reinstall, still no luck.\r\n\r\nAny ideas?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-03T17:07:26.791+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There was some downtime last night with a server maintenance, which we tracked on the[ service status](http://status.leagueoflegends.com/#na) page.
