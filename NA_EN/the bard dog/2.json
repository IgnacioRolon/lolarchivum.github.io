You need a spree of several games in a row without any afks/trolls to be promoted. Ranked promotions shouldn't rely on having a winning spree at a crucial point. It should be about how consistently better you are than your opponents at that level. It SHOULDN'T BE about getting dealt a bad hand at a crucial moment that the system chose.\n\nMy experience exemplifies this. I won 30+ LP per match consistently in Silver V, but then lost my promos due to afks/trolls. However, when I DID win my promos, I skipped a division, meaning the system clearly realized I didn't belong there. However, because I lost two matches that it disproportionately weighed more than my previous matches, I didn't get promoted.\n\nThat is incredibly stupid and just wasted my time. The system knew full well I didn't belong there. Why force me through a ridiculous system?

For the last 2 weeks 40% of my games have had AFK's and I'm in Silver 1. Supports have the hardest time climbing because their performance depends on your whole team.

I find support to have the hardest time in ranked because of how little power you get when it comes to your team fighting. Sure this sounds absurd considering this is the point of most supports, but you can heal, use mikeals, shield, initiate all you want, the team fight is dependent on your teammates following up and doing damage.\n\n Now I do admit that some 4v5 are possible. Ive won about 6 as of right now, but the game becomes so stressful that its more about how much pressure you can take instead of the kind of skill that ranked is meant for. I can't explain what i just said very well, but what I mean is that ranked is meant to test your 5v5, not your 4v5. AFK's aren't excusable whatsoever. Numerous professionals have admitted that ranked isn't a representation of skill. A person with 1000+ games in silver is obviously more skilled than someone who started ranked at 30 and is silver. Why are they the same rank? Because of things outside of their control, like trolls and AFK's.
