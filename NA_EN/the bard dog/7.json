It's annoying, and usually only indicates to me that even if I help you, you're going to be pinging another 500 times again in another minute asking for help. At which point, even if the other player hasn't killed you yet, I will consider it a lost lane. \n\nAlso, a massive pet peeve of mine, top laners getting pissed that there's no gank coming their way...when I'm all the way on the bottom lane, and vice versa, we're only one person, we can not be everywhere on the map unless you're Shen with TP. \n\nI can tell you haven't tried new jungles, if we're clearing blue chances are, unless it is a champion with good sustain (WW and Nunu), junglers are never going to have sufficient HP for a safe gank after clearing blue, you rarely smite blue anymore and it hurts to clear it. So the fact you expect a gank after taking blue, especially if its early game is a bit ridiculous. If it was red, you might have a bit more of a better argument. \n\nJust because you think something will be an easy kill, doesn't necessarily mean it will lead to an easy kill.

Playing Jungle and Top more often of course and I can humbly say that I do not agree with your opinion at all. As a player at my current elo who is comfortable in all roles BUT ADC (adc champs just aint for me atm), I understand what everyone on the map needs and how it feels to get a good jungler and to not get one. Personally when I solo lane or even support, I make sure I DONT need the jungler by trying dominate the lane myself using various lane strategies. However IT IS the jungler's job to get your carry lanes fed and make sure you can assist every lane in any way you can. \n\nMost junglers get pissed off when yo tell them the truth about thier role simply because they aren't that well at it truth be told. As a jungler your responsibility is great and I can understand how overwhelming it can be, however you need to be more organized with your jungle path and more decisive with your decisions by having CLEAR priorities checking off everything on your to do list.  If you aren't active around the map then you aren't doing you job and you dont have to get a kill in lane for a gank to be successful. \n\nYour presence alone can help YOUR laner zone out the enemy which is GOOD. Sometimes they just needs that extra breathing room for farm. Dont call your laners bad, even if they are it helps none. Your job as a jungler is complex in execution but simple in concept. Be active around the  ENTIRE map. Thats it, and if you did your part to help top by showing up once or twice and they still fall behind, well thats on them. You dont need to camp a struggling lane, thats up to you and your situation, but you should never feel that your over burdened. Being all over the map comes with the job, dont start complaining.","replies":[{"poster":"Wînter Fox","date":"2014-12-02T05:52:06.183+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***Ideally***, yes. A jungler would love to be omnipresent, get to every lane multiple times, farm up his jungle, counter jungle, contest every dragon, etc. In practice it usually doesn't work that way.  Sometimes you have a Fizz mid that you want to get snowballing early, so you focus on him. Sometimes you have a Nunu poaching all your shit early, so you need assistance just to defend your own jungle to farm. Sometimes you want to harass an Amumu out of his own jungle. Sometimes you focus on a good bot lane duo to ramp up kills, an early turret, and easy dragon control from then on. Sometimes you have Devourer and want to get some stacks early.\n\nThe main point is that jungler has to make choices. It's one or the other. No jungler is perfect and bad choices are made all the time. but while you're trying to make good decisions for the whole team, nothing is worse than a laner who feels **entitled ** to ganks who's only worried about his lane. Asking for assistance is fine, and judging a jungler for his bad/good decisions is fine as well, but it's that selfish attitude that is the worst.","replies":[{"poster":"Droogzy","date":"2014-12-02T05:56:25.927+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> The main point is that jungler has to make choices.

If you're up against a Garen in the top lane, unless its riven or irelia or any other snowball champion, chances are, I'm never going to bother ganking that lane since he's incredibly difficult to kill. I'd rather focus on bottom lane control as constant top lane ganks which most likely will not result in a kill are a waste time as oppose to being able to control bottom lane.\n\nThis is just one example of numerous decisions a jungler needs to make.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Lord Dusteon","date":"2014-12-02T01:28:21.067+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"The jungle is harder.

With champions such as WW or Udyr, until they get a few levels, the only thing they should do is AFK farm. Another aspect is that just as a laner can be bad, so can the junglers. Often, it is not immediately evident since monsters are AI controlled, but keep in mind that not everyone is proficient with the role.
