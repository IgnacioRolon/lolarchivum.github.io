That they have no idea if this will go on sale or not. Also unknown until release.\n\n~~She will be released some time within the next patch.~~ They changed their minds, it'll be out in a few months and anywhere in between. the date will stay unknown, but until then it will be out on PBE early. I can see why. There's definitely a lot of bugs that would come with something as big and complicated as this skin.\n\nThere can only be 1 Sona on 1 team, so if you were to play blind picks, there's a chance the enemy team will have a Sona as well with the same skin. Therefore the songs will overlap, and this is why the song is not global to both teams and limited to only yours. This will also confirm that this is as unique as you can get for a skin, so she will be the only one in game to have music tracks of their own. If anybody else DOES end up getting a musical skin concept, they will not come with their own music unless it involves an ability.\n\nSong can be muted manually by YOU, and only be changed by the person with the skin, so be sure to make a majority vote on what you'd like to listen to. If you don't get what you like, well.. Too bad. It's their skin.\n\nTracks/skin can be changed by using the command /Toggle and choose or CTRL +5\n\nVO: When you listen to her voice, it has been remixed and been made to fit her track accordingly. The fact you can barely understand her is ON PURPOSE..! Check the vid above.\n\nHope this helps some people. If you have any more questions, post them down below and i may gladly look 'em up to answer it.\n\n \nI said \"FEW\" Months on purpose. Make sure people don't keep making the same mistake to buy rp and shit so early. The early hype is sly and quick. You'd want it so bad the sec it was heard you'd wouldn't think logically about saving your rp if you got it way too damn early and had to wait a least a full month till release.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Galetta","date":"2015-02-05T00:57:31.153+0000","up_votes":31,"down_votes":3,"body":"Hey just to clarify DJ Sona will not be out in patch 5.3.

There is **no way** to have any kind of voice that wont detract from, or interrupt, the music. Additionally, the fact that the voice isn't actual words leaves the player wondering to themselves \"the fuck is she even saying\" every time she talks, further disrupting the natural flow of the skin. People *understand* what Riot was trying to do with the voice, It just doesn't work in its current state and it needs to be removed, or re-thought.\n\nRight now, it seems like the whole \"don't want her voice to detract from the music\" reason just seems like a massive cop-out for making a voice that isn't up to par with the rest of the skin, and it's such a shame too. This skin is fucking godlike in every sense of the word but the voice drags it down so hard right now.","replies":[{"poster":"TTRlovesMittens","date":"2015-02-05T04:21:24.877+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":2,"body":"Once you play it, you'll know. Right now I'm testing it on the PBE and, honestly, it fits thematically. Even the mock-up mash video doesn't do it full justice. There is a video on SkinSpotlights that include the background tracks and the VO going at the same time, and the bug fixes today helped everyone have that experience. This is closest to the actual experience you get on PBE right now, and I personally love it.\n\nI have a few counterpoints I want to bring up as a defense for this choice and why I support this VO:\n\n1) The voice isn't FULLY unintelligible. In the case of the reverb and echo, Sona has had this built into her VO since day 1 really. Her normal VO has a ton of echo and reverb since it's supposed to be the mind-link she has with the summoner. Here's something I posted in another thread as a defense of what she \"says:\"\n\n> ...it IS mashed up versions of her old quote system. For example, around 1:30, it sounds like she says \"fanf-ends-a symph\" which is really close to a recutting of \"the fanfare ascends\" and \"a symphony of justice.\" At 1:37, it sounds like \"uar-er-ime-uet\" or \"quarter time\" and \"a sublime duet.\" All of the quotes are like this, good job Riot!\n\nKeep in mind these are the Kinetic VO portions. Concussive and Ethereal have their own banks with other quotes, and honestly the Concussive VO is so rad. I played back the video after the PBE patch today and I couldn't find the quotes that play in Concussive mode, though at this point it IS hard to pick out which is which, but that isn't a negative. I'll explain it in point 3.\n\n2) It fits much better over the music than you think it does. Personally, I think the VO works best with Concussive right now. The echo and reverb make her one with the genre. The best way to experience it is to look at the SkinSpotlights video of the Concussive skill set. I personally don't think it breaks the flow of the skin at all. I personally think it adds to it. I'll probably make my own video to share with friends, I'm playing with the ingame sound mixer to get the best \"DJ Sona\" settings to prep for release. In the SkinSpotlights video, the music is too soft and the voices and SFX are too loud.\n\n3) This is MAINLY a musical skin, and I personally see that reflected in the vocoding of the VO. If you've ever listened to \"Different Trains\" by Steve Reich (pulling out the BIG musical reference guns, lol), the entire purpose of that piece is to reflect the natural inflections of the voice. Inflections of the voice are pretty much the pitches you speak at, and this skin taps into this by vocoding them and using them conceptually as musical notes rather than actual words. This is how I noticed that the VO was remixed portions of the previous quote bank. Thus, they wanted her voice not to detract from the music, but to literally BE MUSIC itself. It's a fantastic concept!","replies":[{"poster":"Derpy Mike","date":"2015-02-05T04:50:21.681+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":20,"body":"\"The voice isn't FULLY unintelligible\"\nI really don't think that two or three words here and there count.\n\n\"It fits much better over the music than you think it does\"\nI'm sorry I don't think you know what I think, friend.\n\n\"This is MAINLY a musical skin\"\nNo, this is ENTIRELY a musical skin. Disk Jockeys aren't well known for their voices.\n\n\nYes you raise very good points. \n\nNone of which I agree with. \n\nAnd herein lies the issue with this entire discussion, It's almost entirely subjective. At the end of the day there's going to be people who love the skin's \"voice\". There are going to be people who are willing to tolerate the vocal imperfections because how good the rest of the skin is. And then there are people who aren't going to purchase the skin exclusively because of how strongly the feel about the low quality of the voice. And honest to god it saddens me to the fucking core that the 3rd category even exists. Unfortunately, I'm in it. The following is not my quote but I think it sums up how I, and many, many, others feel right now about the current state of the skin.\n\n\"I'm legitimately debating whether or not the skin is actually worth the asking price. It'd be like finding the perfect car but later being told it only has 3 wheels; the dealer is the only person that can sell you the 4th but they won't no matter how much you ask.

They record new lines and you can't even tell how awesome they are because they're jumbled up and remixed with the old ones.\n\nI don't like not being able to understand Sona. I guess that's subjective, but I think Riot's reason for making her unintelligible (to help her meld with the music) is weak. A voice is musical by nature; being rendered gibberish doesn't make it any more or less musical, but it does make it sound strange with the music turned off. Me? I always watch movies and TV with closed captioning on because I'm annoyed when I don't know what people are saying. Mumbling, not being able to understand what I'm hearing irks me. So I'm biased.\n\nEven so, I still don't feel it satisfies the \"a new voice over\" element of the ultimate skin tier. They're still re-using a lot of the old VO and hiding it behind a remix. I just don't like that. It seems like cut corners when she has 3 hours of sound effects.

Sometimes it does but I still enjoy some good Ana Tijoux Spanish Rapping or my Italian screamo bands. I know what they're saying only because I looked up the meaning behind my favorite songs a while back, but listening to the song and getting lost in the emotions I don't feel I need to stop and try to understand it.\n\nThat's a *personal* preference.

The argument fell apart before you were able to type it out.\n\nI'm not going to respond to all of you since you're basically saying the same thing.  \"If you don't like it, don't buy it.\"  That's a terrible argument.  Are you honestly suggesting I just accept what Riot presents to me regardless of whether or not I have issues with it and just be happy with it?  At $30, the answer to that question will always be no.  Riot is the one that wants community feedback.  if they didn't, the pbe and these forums wouldn't exist at all.  Red posts wouldn't happen and the client/customer relationship they're trying to build further wouldn't exist.  I've given Riot my feedback and I've explained why her voice was subpar.  I'm sorry that I don't bend over and just accept what's given to me by a company seeking to make profit on a product.  It's my money and I would very much like to turn it over to Riot but one small detail is holding me back.  \nFor the fellow that told me to turn off the voice sounds, are you suggesting I play at a disadvantage then?  Voice sounds provide audio cues that let me know immediately that Diana threw out her Q, Lux is ulting, Shyvana jumped in somewhere, Rek'Sai is coming in, and Sion is on the war path.  Do you realize just how bad what you're suggesting is?\nMaybe I should employ the strategy of boot-licking and perhaps I'd elicit a response from a Red over my legitimate concerns.  The only thing that I, and the others from here and elsewhere, are asking for is a Rioter to actually quell our concerns which, as of yet, they have not even attempted to do.  Or perhaps I should follow your advice and just willfully pass $30 to their bank accounts.  \n\nWhat you all seem to be incapable of understanding is that I have chosen to spend my time seeking to help Riot make that product the best it could possibly be, similar to how you're spending your time trying to convince everyone it already is.  Both of us have similar goals and both of us want the same end game.  The only difference is I, and many others, miraculously arrived at a different opinion than you did.  Perish the thought.  To clarify, I want the skin and I can more than afford it but in it's current form, I have doubts it's actually worth the asking price.  Instead of stewing in my own disgust, I am opening up dialogues because I want to be convinced this is worth the price.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Kerveros,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=a7ExrdB9,comment-id=000a0000,timestamp=2015-02-05T10:42:02.312+0000)\n>\n> snip\n\nYou sound angry.  The more you bold post, the more people will take you seriously.

But yes, I am asking for changes that I feel are within my rights.  Per Riot's own website, per Riot's own description, per Riot's own documentation...\n\n\"An ultimate skin is a complete reimagining of a champion that includes an evolved model and additional features and bonuses (e.g., summoner icons).\nFeatures: new model that evolves into different forms, new textures, new splash image, new animations, new visual, **new voice over** and sounds, additional/bonus content.\"\n\nsrc: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752874-Guide-to-Skin-Price-Tiers\n\nI put the important part in bold for your ease.  I'm sorry that my opinions and my concerns differ so greatly from yours, but a remixed voice that was, from a customer's point of view lazily done, does not constitute itself as a \"new voice over.\"  It is exactly as it describes itself,  a remixed voice over.  If you had actually bothered to read my argument like a few of your fellows have, you'd see that this is the only point of concern I and many others have.  It's not new and yet we're still expected to pay for it as if it is new.  That is shady business and I know Riot is better than that.\n\n\"So next time before anyone goes to comment and start typing their ranting and complaints about something remember, that your comment represents **YOUR** thoughts and **YOUR** complaints. There might be people who share these with you but under no condition does it mean that it represents **ALL** of the players in the League community.\"\n\nDon't you find it fascinating how well you're argument works against you?

Not every aspect of every skin is going to please every player. That's impossible. I've had several skins come out that I was extremely disappointed in that I was looking forward to. Did Riot change the skin because some people didn't like it? Uh, no. Is Riot going to change her VO because half of the players dislike it? Well, if they change it because half of the players dislike it, **then the half that did will now be in those shoes**. Someone is not going to be pleased. Someone has to be. Lucky for me, I adore the skin and believe the VO fits perfectly with the music. Unfortunately, some of you don't. I understand and respect the arguments that have been made. I respect everyone's opinion because you're entitled to your opinion. All I'm saying is some of the people who have posted act like their opinion is the only one that matters and act like Riot is going to go bankrupt without their $30 for this skin.\n\nThis is how I think of it: These skins aren't just made for players. Yes, it's content for a game that you play and have the option to purchase, but all of these skins are more than just something you, the player, can buy, **they are art**. This skin is someone's baby. They've been working on it for a long time. (Obviously, more than one person.) Just like the champions are someone's babies that they've spent countless hours on. It belongs to those people in the artful sense. I relate this to tattoos. Yeah, you get that tattoo on your body, but did you do the work? No. That is the tattoo artist's work. That is their art. You display it on your body because you love what they've done (if your experience went as planned anyway). When I got my first tattoo, something that surprised me (and demanded my absolute respect) was when the tattoo artist was explaining how to care for it and what products not to use. She said, \"Don't use Neosporin or insert-other-thing-here. Don't put that sh!t on my tattoos.\" She called the art on my body *hers*. I feel like that would anger anyone else, but I respected her immensely for it. It is hers. She's the artist, the creator. She takes pride in her work.\n\nI'm sure everyone at Riot takes pride in their work just like that. They fix these champions and skins up, work on them until they adore them and are proud of what they've done. Then they announce it, put it up for testing, and adjust it to make their vision truly come alive and function properly in the game. **Their vision**. Not yours. Because it isn't your artwork.\n\nThen they get all this hate because some people don't like it.\n\nIt's theirs. It accomplishes what they want it to accomplish and will function in the way that they want it to function. They can charge as much as they want for it, and they shouldn't be expected to listen to the whims of those who dislike it. Well, guess what, you don't have to buy what you don't like. You wouldn't hang an ugly picture on your living room wall. Don't buy a skin that you're not satisfied with. Many of us are entirely satisfied with this skin and appreciate it in the way Riot wanted.\n\nAlso, I find it disrespectful to call it bad quality and to call Riot lazy. The VO fits with Riot's vision. They are pleased with their work and are proud of their work. I don't believe it to be low quality, and they're not going to be proud of something low quality. And lazy? Oh, excuse me. Why don't you keep this extremely complex game up and running while pumping out champions and skins that please everyone? You make the champion. You make the skin. You do the VO. You do the work. You fix all the bugs and balance the game. Oh, and have it done by next patch or you won't get paid. You can't. But they do their best to accomplish it. They are professionals who spend their days making League of Legends an absolutely amazing and **completely free** experience. You sit on your computer at home and play it because you enjoy it. Please don't get so hateful and offensive because one skin doesn't meet your expectations when you did nothing productive to make it become reality and have no right to demand changes to their work. You just enjoy it - or not.\n\nAnd to clarify again, I'm not saying that you can't dislike it. It's perfectly fine to dislike it. It's perfectly fine to state why you dislike it. But please don't act like Riot is sh!t just because you're not happy with some of their work. State your opinion and why you feel that way so that Riot can produce a more variety of skins in the future that do suite your tastes, then leave it be. Don't ask Leonardo da Vinci to make Mona Lisa blonde because you don't like dark hair on women. Don't demand a new VO on DJ Sona because you can't get past her unintelligible lines (which as stated was completely intentional) to fully experience and appreciate the skin. I'm sorry if you're nitpicky and have to know what she's saying to be satisfied, but many of us are satisfied with how she is. Personally, I don't even actually listen to what they say after the initial release experience is over. Occasionally, Jinx will make me giggle when running back to lane, but I'm not lingering on her every word.

And yet you **DEMAND** not even **ASK ** from a company that it's their **JOB** to make products like these, and they have no obligation whatsoever to fulfill every single one of your demands.\n\nHow selfish, egotistical and conceited are you to  **DEMAND** things just like that? do you think it's a simple task to ask the voice actor to just take a stroll towards RIOT HQ and \"drop some lines\"? Do you think that the artists who create the art/music/sfx do this for charity? This is a Business all the people who collaborated and cooperated in the creation of this skin including the art, music, special effects, VO did not do it simply on a whim it is their **JOB** and i am pretty sure it took them a long damn time to get to the point to just present to all the people this content so far. And yet you have the **NERVE** to **DEMAND** changes on something that you don't even have a say in because even if you like it or not, this skin is not available yet and it is not for sale yet because it is still under development, and you have not contributed one damn thing to the people who created this to begin with.\n\nThere is a huge different in between **SUGGESTING** to these people what they could do and  **DEMANDING** changes to happen as if it is a royal decree of some sort.

This game might be made for the community of its players, but it doesn't mean it is also run by the community and its players. While we players just go log in to our accounts and decide to play a game pick our champ , rune pages, masteries, no one pauses to give it a thought that all this is a culmination of all the efforts and work that is done by a group of people just so **WE** the players of the league community can play a game and have fun and enjoy it while doing so. People may not realize it but it probably has taken an extreme amount of work and effort to make League Of Legends the game it is today, hell i remember when i joined the game in 2009 and compared to then the game has done leaps and bounds to the point it stands today. It is not **PERFECT** sure there are a lot of issues that are being addressed everyday, people work on these issues everyday from the silliest of things like bugs to the more serious subjects like toxic players and technical issues.\n\nSo next time before anyone goes to comment and start typing their ranting and complaints about something remember, that your comment represents **YOUR** thoughts and **YOUR** complaints. There might be people who share these with you but under no condition does it mean that it represents **ALL** of the players in the League community.","replies":[{"poster":"Zhlandir","date":"2015-02-05T16:55:00.767+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"I dunno, the argument 'Can YOU do that?

No? Then shut the fuck up' usually isn't that ... great of an argument.\n\nI'm not sure who was making this particular argument, or if something was misinterpreted, but I can try to address your points. :)\n\nThere is value in people doing tasks that we do not do ourselves. When I go to a restaurant, I pay someone to cook my food, and pay someone else to serve it to me, and I pay yet another person to clean up after me (not to mention paying the establishment for a place to eat.)  I'm not paying someone for things I cannot do, but rather what I'm not doing, if that makes sense. It's the foundation of civilization (we don't all have to farm so you can do something different for us.)\n\nThe price of the game has nothing to do with the price of the cosmetic goods they sell to go with it. For example, World of Warcraft has to be purchased, and a subscription is paid per month of use, and they also sell cosmetic virtual goods in a storefront in the form of mounts and miniature pets. The fact that their players pay $180 a year for the privilege to play their game that also has a box price is completely separate from their vanity pricing, just like skins in League of Legends has pricing completely separate from the fact that Riot has chosen to make their game free to obtain and play. \n\nThe value of the vanity additions to the game are not easy to pinpoint, because it's a matter of personal taste and preference. I love Oriana, I do not like any skin she has more than her default skin. To me, any price paid for any of her skins is far too much. I can much more personal value in even a few dollars in a champion I rarely play. That's why instead of just describing the skins as virtual goods, some of us are calling them art. Like a painting, photograph, song, or tattoo, all of the skins in league will ultimately be loved, hated, and ignored all at once by different portions of the community. \n\nAnd usually for someone to post on the boards they have strong opinions of the topic they're discussing, or have a strong desire to white-knight or mediate. That's fine, this should be a place to explore differences of opinion. Miscommunication can and will happen, especially when opinions are stated with passion and emotion. But for any discussion to be fruitful it must be directed at the problem, and the finger-pointing that crops up quickly eclipses strong and valid points that  participants have.","replies":[{"poster":"Kerveros","date":"2015-02-06T05:18:36.178+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"actually i was the one commenting about the specific person being incapable of doing such a feat as making a skin and the quote up top actually misinterprets my comment way off. what i actually said was:\n **\"So instead of being ungrateful and arrogant why don't you just take what you're offered and be glad you got at least that? considering the situation you're in no position to demand as i said previously because they don't need your money since the game is f2p. also customer concerns? ha yeah right keep dreaming if you think it's so bad why don't you do it yourself huh big shot? oh yeah cause you can't! simple done.\"**\n\ni never said anything along the lines of \"shut the fuck up\" what i was trying to say is that if the person believed that riots job was so bad in making the skin why didn't the person try the feat of \"fixing\" or creating the skin themselves?

To someone living in a West Coast, art-heavy community, this hits the nail on the head. I waited years to get my first tattoo until I found an artist that I clicked with. I didn't have my references on hand, I just stuck my head in his parlor to get an idea of his style. But when I described it and he drew *spot on* what I had in mind I was blown away, and all of my body art is from him because of it. \n\n***Morale of the story, if you love it, then get it.* **\n\n**BUT **if you cannot live with a certain aspect of it, then don't get it and end up regreting the purchase. You can still play the game like you always have, and chances are you'll get teammates with the skin and you'll be able to hear the music without the VO. With things as purely aesthetic as art, the bottom line is the artists make the final call. I have passed up paintings because they weren't the size I wanted  (too big!), and I have passed up league skins because I didn't like the particles (spells on Charred Mao clash to me).
