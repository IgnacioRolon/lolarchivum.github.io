I don't have the best of computers, and I know that i'm not the only one who crashes only to lose lp. there's gotta be some way riot can distinguish if someone leaves the game voluntarily or by dc'ing, and i want to know why they don't use it in their leaverbuster/ranking system. I want my lp back, and I know a lot of others do as well.\r\nsorry for the ranty post, hope you guys agree.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-13T03:35:07.247+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately, there no way for us to give you LP back or modify LP at all. The system is designed this way to prevent any sort of abuse. Additionally, due to the sheer essence of what a disconnection is, it's not possible for the system to determine why you've disconnected from a match, it only sees a disconnection.\n\nThe biggest reason disconnections happen are because of network settings that conflict with League. I highly encourage you to work through our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to ensure your settings are 100% good. Let me know if you still encounter these issues after working through those steps.","replies":[]}]}
