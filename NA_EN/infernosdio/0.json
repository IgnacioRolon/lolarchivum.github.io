The first login will show \"Logging in...\", then pop up a Connection Error window.\n\nClosing the Client and logging in again will be successful.  If I tried to close the Client before logging in, it will still give the same Error pattern.  Seems that it needs to try to log in first, fail, then be successful.\n\nThis is pretty irritating behavior.
