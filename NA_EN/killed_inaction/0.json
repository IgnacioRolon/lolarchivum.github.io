I'm not a huge fan of the current skin selection, so until the release of a new skin for her I would like to use a custom skin _if_ it's safe.\n\nBasically, I'm looking for someone to confirm the safety of a custom skin or give advice on how to check for any bannable software. The one I have in mind is used at 15:52 in the video above (the link should take you directly to it). To note: this is not my video, and it's somewhat loud.\n\nHere's the site that has it available:\nhttps://mapskins.com/tag/Taliyah/\n\nI am aware of the \"use at your own risk\" policy; I'm just looking for advice on a more specific scenario.\n\nThanks in advance!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-24T04:35:21.775+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since you mentioned being aware of our policy on third party software, I'll spare you those details.

I've heard before that information relating to that sort of stuff is restricted since it could give scripters/hackers/etc. an edge in avoiding triggering the system. Would that be part or all of the issue here?\n\nThank you for the reply. I'll avoid this stuff, then. I look forward to seeing what the next Taliyah skin will be.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-24T20:18:00.662+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can't say for sure if one custom skin would be okay, because there's a chance for any of them to have malicious software attached. For example, some really bored and cranky teen could make a custom skin that has a virus attached. It's not to say it happens all the time, but that's an example of why it's good to avoid them all together.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Darkdemon653","date":"2017-07-24T18:38:00.901+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Broporo,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=WwmEh4RW,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-07-24T04:35:21.775+0000)\n>\n> Since you mentioned being aware of our policy on third party software, I&#x27;ll spare you those details.
