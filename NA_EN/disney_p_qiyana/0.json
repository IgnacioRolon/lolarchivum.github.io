The amount of memory that the client uses can be affected by how long it's been up, and how many clubs, personal and chat room conversations you have going at the same time. eSports notifications and videos open in the client can also affect this.\n\nTo troubleshoot your latency spikes, I recommend working through our [network guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to ensure your local settings aren't conflicting with League. Let me know if you continue to have issues with latency after working through those steps.","replies":[]}]}
