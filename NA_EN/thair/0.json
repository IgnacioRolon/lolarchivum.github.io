At the moment he can only cast ult on people who are on top of him. I would think that give him something else to do. Giving him the instant cast of q would really help him. Even if he can still cast him q instantly he still has the weakness of getting jumped on. The counterplay could easily be wait for his cd to be down then engage like many other champs. You could even make his cd a bit longer or change it a bit to where it would be ok to be able to cast it instantly. Anivia can instantly pop her q after she fires it but aerlion sol can&#039;t. I get the tactic would be a bit unhealthy but i bet riot could find a way to balance it. He has a hard lane phase and the only thing he can do is engage but he flys in with his q being large and he is in the middle of everyone gets jumped on and then he has to ult and run away but he then cant q the people who are on him. I just think that changing his q to be able to be instantly popped would help him extremely well and be a good way to fix this amazing looking dragon to be played more instead of only being able to be played in top elo. He is a really cool look dragon with great particles and controls stars he deserves to be changed and helped a bit so that people can play the champion he is.","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2016-07-12T20:29:12.985+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"An instant, large aoe stun isn't counterplay.  It would also be followed by at least 2 hits from the stars.\n\nAurelion is already played in the LCS, showing that he at least isn't weak, so why should he get such a buff?  Especially since it would actually be a pretty massive buff.","replies":[{"poster":"Thair","date":"2016-07-12T21:15:32.874+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He was played but he got rekted and im not saying it isnt counterplay im saying you could still have counterplay even with him having a instant q i know riot could balance it. He only can be played by the pros he isnt a good champ for newer players. A new player has a better chance with azir than him to be honest. The stun would help him a ton and yes if they just changed it now he would be broken but riot would fix that but the best way to change him to be better and easiest way would be to change that q and balance it somehow nerfing the stun duration or damage  or giving it a longer cd whatever it is i feel lik that is the best way to change how much he is played and played more.","replies":[]}]}]}
