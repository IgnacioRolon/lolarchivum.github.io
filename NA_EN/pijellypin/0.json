I then present possible issues that could rise from putting URF out with my third plausible issue holding a possible solution. That is all. I'm not attempting to defend Riot. Hell there could be no issues with putting URF out right now, but I'm only touching on the possible reasons it isn't out since it. . . . well, isn't out.\n\nIn a sense, I'm presenting possible issues, questioning them, and seeing if they could be fixed. If there are no issues, then I've no Idea why Riot hasn't released URF. They said they wouldn't release it today, but if we dismiss there being any possible problems as to why they chose not to bring it back, then I don't know why they made that decision.
