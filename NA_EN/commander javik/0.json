When I finished my bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering I decided to go all the way for a doctorate degree and moved to Boston. While I was living in Boston I saw that Riot was in town doing recruiting at the local colleges for their internship program and they were hosting a Worlds viewing party at a bar near where I lived. Having no friends in the city, I thought it would be a great opportunity to meet people with similar interests as me (League) and so I went. At the bar I met Riot August - the champion designer of Gnar, Ekko, Jinx, Vi, and Jhin and we became friends. He reached out to me and encouraged me to apply! I spent some time thinking about it and then decided I'd give it a shot - at that point I realized I didn't want to commit 5 years for a doctorate degree and opted to finish with a master's. So I got my master's in Structural Engineering, applied to Riot, and got rejected! I moved back home and worked as an engineer for a year. August reached out to me again and told me I should apply once more - this time I prepared (watched a ton of youtube videos about game design), went through the interview process, and lo and behold I got the job!

For example, if you were interested in being an engineer here, I'd spend a lot of time learning about code, come up with and working on my own individual projects, and really trying my best to connect with other people who share the same passion.\n\nI did this when I was a civil engineer. I got myself really involved in various CE clubs in college, did extracurricular research and helped out professors with their work whenever I could, and attended as many conferences, meetings, etc. with other engineers in the area as possible. It's a lot of work, but I was really passionate about what I did that drive is what ultimately took me to Boston to get my graduate degree.
