This is readily apparent when switching between the default Riven Skin and DragonBlade. Animation canceling, especially on Q, is near broken and makes the skin unfit for play.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-07-08T17:29:06.760+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Loghan,\n\nDragonblade Riven uses the same animation set as other Riven skins, which means that animations and movement should not be affected. \n\nFrom what I understand (I've asked several Riven mains), the difference between this skin and the other skin is the (Q) sound. Since it's different than her other skins, it feels a bit different and may take a bit of adjusting. \n\nThe different sounds are intended behavior for this skin.","replies":[]}]}
