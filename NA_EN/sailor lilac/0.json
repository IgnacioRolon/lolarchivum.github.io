This never happened before and I had been playing league for about a year and a couple of months at this time. My ping was at a consistent 26ms before this patch and now randomly I am getting very high pings of almost 500ms. I went around and have seen that other people have made discussions of this and I've tried everything that people in those threads found worked for them, not anything that riot has suggested thus far sorry to say. My lag seems to always come 100% of the time when I'm next to a champion or a jungle monster, sometimes even when I'm not next to either. I've seen responses from Riot employees saying that it's most likely network issues happening with servers, but the answers just stop there; I was making this to ask if there is anything more we could know or if there is some fix coming that we don't know about. I have come back every week to play a game and check if the problem has been fixed since 7.2 release but it's still persisting.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-03-02T04:34:08.160+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Big changes in latency are almost always caused by routing changes at your ISP or their partner network that directly affects how long it takes for your connection to hit our servers. In order to look into this, we'll need to take a close look at your network route. I recommend running a traceroute with a network app called [**WinMTR**](http://winmtr.net/) in order to accomplish this. After calling up the application, you simply need to paste **104.160.131.1** into the host field and start the trace. After the trace has run for 5 minutes, export your results as text and paste them in a reply.\n\nLet me know if you run into any issues with this.","replies":[{"poster":"sailor lilac","date":"2017-03-05T06:16:19.047+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay thank you for that !
