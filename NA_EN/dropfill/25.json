So yes, there's tons of other champions who can use it. Not to mention Yasuo himself does less damage on crits than anyone else in the game thanks to his passive reducing the damage of his crits. But lets not forget that choosing that mastery means you can't choose the mastery that gives you up to 80 extra damage on-hit in the lategame (which would benefit Yasuo or anyone else who autos a lot greatly), or the mastery that burns your opponent for a percent of your bonus AD and total AP.","replies":[{"poster":"T RexHasTinyArms","date":"2015-11-01T22:07:26.205+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think the bonus on hit damage is going to be stronger on champions that have on hit builds for hybrid damage than on ADCs or something.
