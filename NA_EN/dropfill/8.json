I understand it is very hard to try and nerf Katarina due to the nature of her kit, and I agree she is in need of a slight one ( I am a Kat main), but in order to truly truly rework her and keep her as an assassin, you have to change her whole entire kit. Lowering damage won't solve anything on a champion based off of getting resets on kills and assists.

It just made her a better solo laner than a support. Also, I really dislike how people think all Kat players have to do is mash buttons or just E into a fight, press some buttons and get out of it. Kat is very predictable, especially if you have wards map ( none apparent in lower tiers) and she is more heavily punished by cc than most champions, nor is her assassination as quick as other assassins. Especially with the removal of DFG. I'm also tired of people complaining about how much damage she does. She is an assassin! She is supposed to do a lot of burst damage with a lot of risk, of which she has ( go in a second too late or a second too early and you EASILY can cost your team the teamfight).  To me, it seems that people just want the removal of the assassin role in general. I'm sorry you guys have to play against champions that actually take skill and forethought to play against.","replies":[]}]}
