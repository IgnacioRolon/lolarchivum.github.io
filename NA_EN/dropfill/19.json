Only CC is a slow.\r\nI mean, common. Can we buff immobile mages?","replies":[{"poster":"TehNACHO","date":"2015-02-21T22:05:56.151+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"His damage is DPS based. Ahri's Burst orientated damage will reach its peak sometime in the Mid Game, but Karthus' as a damage source for your team will still be effective upon the latest stages of the game.\n\nIf Ahri is a straight mage, Karthus is geared more like an APC. You can argue that you can't possibly beat Ahri in areas that Mages excel in and, well yeah that's a good argument. That's mostly because, however, Karthus' higher functions don't operate like a Mage.","replies":[{"poster":"blackcat1300","date":"2015-02-28T07:27:23.470+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"his Q's damage is to weak.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Leu07","date":"2015-03-02T19:39:12.334+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"IMO Karthus is one sleeper op, just wait until more nerfs come to other mid laners.

If Ahri's damage is high compared to Karthus, you're high. Karthus late game is the most powerful mage in this game. You will get butthurt if you dont stop him. Also his range and early laning phase is not weak. It just not strong as others. You cant deal with Ahri 110-130k damage in a 50 minutes game. Karthus AoE monster TF mage, Ahri is a mobile kit mage.

Just afk farm denying any pushes made by your opponent and make sure to keep map awareness for awesome ults.  Karthus isn't going to make great plays as a mid laner (he has terrible roams compared to many other champs), but going to the island of top lane works pretty well since a lot of top laners really aren't huge threats to him (and even if they do jump on him and kill him, he is going to trade it back...)
