Haven't gotten my hands on Runeglaive Ez yet, but I've been following what happened with the pros and why it worked.

They may not delete a squishy in less than a second, but they can bring any and all non-tanks in the enemy team simultaneously down to 25% or less with a full combo. This is what I'm talking about when I say that champs should be classified by playstyle. \n\nIf you lump Ez and Leblanc in with Vel'Koz and Brand, the term mage doesn't give you an idea on how they are best played, only how they might be building.

Mid game, just a quick E-W-Q combo can easily 75% any squishy. Add in the ult, or make it late game, and that'll be 100-0 with overkill. Sure, he doesn't have %MissingHealth (commonly called an Execute), but neither does Akali, Katarina, Talon, or many others, while, at the same time, Volibear does. %MissingHealth is a poor indicator of being an Assassin. \n\n-As for Mobility, I'd say that having a blink on a 7 second cooldown (given 40%cdr), which can be lowered by landing Q's, qualifies as stupid levels of mobility. The blink allows him to catch people out really easily. \n\n-What kind of assassin has \"Mow 'em all down damage?\" I mean, assassins are pretty much universally classified as single target, 100-0 damage, then almost completely impotent until the cooldowns are back up. Some of the AD assassins and even Fizz can autoattack relatively well, but they're still nothing even remotely close to \"mow 'em all down damage.\" That designation clearly belongs to mages and ADC's, who either have massive AOE to clearcut a swatch through the enemy team, or continuous, unrelenting damage. \n\n-As said before, the blink and shear range of his skills gives him a ton of catching power. At 450 cast range, 750 range on the ensuing bolt, and 1000+ range on all his other abilities, stepping out of the backline as a squishy can easily get you killed. Sure, Ez might get caught out himself, since his mobility is down, but if he picks up Zhonya's or the team's got his back, he'll be fine. Even if he doesn't, he'd still go 1for1, which is pretty much all that Zed or Talon or Fizz can really hope to do if they don't do things perfectly. \n\nI also couldn't help but notice you ignored LeBlanc in all of your examples, seeing as she is the one I've been saying AP Ez plays most like. What category do you fit her into? \n\nAlso, I think that it would be best to think of characters less about what they can do as a whole, and more about a specific build. For instance, when you think of Evelynn, do you think \"tank\", even though that's commonly considered to be the most viable build on her? I, for one, just think of her in terms of what build we're talking about, saying \"tank Eve\" not just Eve. Like how I say AP Ez, not just Ez. AP Ez is an assassin (AP, AD, doesn't matter. Playstyle is the same. Delete one person, back off, wait for cooldowns). AD Ez is a marksman/AD caster; he's got the autoattack steroid to let him deal greater than average dps on his autos, while also relying heavily on his abilities to deal damage for him.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"LICENSED HOOKER","date":"2015-07-06T21:54:55.967+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://i.imgur.com/L7qsd3J.png[/img]","replies":[{"poster":"Vistha Kai","date":"2015-07-06T21:57:18.205+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You don't need [img] tag.
