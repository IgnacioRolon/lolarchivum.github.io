Right now GP's barrel is a very high rewarding skill.  At this very moment, in the ideal situation of 6 items and a choke point, he can wreck an entire team for around 30%+ Hp for tanky  champions and over 70% against squishy champions.  I know this because I have used GP's barrels to chunk opponents for around that much in games.   On top of that, his gold generation when you max Q allows him to get basically half a minion with each kill.  Even when he doesnt max it, he essentially gets 400 gold in 100 minions. (Yes I know this is in accurate but bear with me my point is coming soon.)\n\nNow let's exam a typical GP game.  At the start, for every minion he kills, he gets more gold than you.  Even if you bully him under tower, unless you're very far ahead of him or getting a bunch of kills, you are essentially losing lane as if neither one of you takes tower until jg intervention occurs, then he will be at a greater item advantage. (His global ult allowing for long range ganking to occur doesnt hurt either.) This item advantage translates to his late game where he should finish off his full item set before anyone else.  To make him even more oppressive, one good barrel can literally win a team fight and, would you look at that, he has tons of access to it because it's not an ultimate.\n\nDoes this make GP a poorly designed champion?  No.  He is well designed.  His barrels can be destroyed easily in lanes by ranged champions.  This makes late game sieging/antisieging very difficult. However, exploiting this weakness can get much harder when you start dealing with jg terrain and a smart GP.  I cant remember the game, it was either china or korea where a team lost a dragon and i think gave enemy team five dragons but still won the teamfight because 1 barrel was placed in a bush where a ward was removed and 4/5 of the enemy team walked too close and the GP did a quick EQ combo and chunked everyone to blinking red HP even as the dragon was stolen.  Hence why Riot feels he is overtuned and needs some turning down in number values.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2015-09-10T21:01:20.534+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":2,"body":"Well put.

Which is kinda the Opposite of what they want to do. And that still wouldn't have any bearing on the maximum damage potential.\n\n2) And AoE nerf would be even worse. As Barrel damage was done to augment your own damage output. Yet his AoE is Crucial for Wave Clear, and splitpushing. \n\nAnd believe me, his counterplay is their. \n\nThat's not the Real problem we have with these nerfs. Riot decided to Nerf his Barrels on the Grounds that his, Best Case Scenario was too good. Which makes it sound like they have not factored in his Worse, or Average case Scenario. (Whether they did or not, I don't know) A) Is loosing his upper bound on his Damage output going to significantly impact his Play rate, his play style, and his win rate? And B) if Yes, how might he be compensated? \n\nThese are questions that Riot may not be able to answer until the collect player data. If GP is not Viable after Riot decided he can't have that level of Burst, Where could he shift that Power? His DPS? (Some what Dangerous being Melee) His Tankyness? (would be my choice) His Global Pressure?
