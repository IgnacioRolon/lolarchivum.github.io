That helps with surviving ambient burst but not with actual focus, at all. A mage with Deathcap/Morello/Luden's dies about as quickly as a mage with Rylai's/Abyssal/Zhonya's in most situations.\n\nAD defensive itemisation has actually got a variety of defensive passives and actives. Sterak's and Maw are both insane in 1v1 scenarios (easily turning assassins jumping onto caught out ADCs as kills for the ADC) while giving a shocking amount of tankiness in team fights, and Merc Scim pretty much automatically invalidates any attempt a mage can make at killing an ADC before you even get to the point of procing the Maw or Sterak's shield.\n\nYou haven't put any thought into the state of defensive itemisation in both stats if you don't realise how massive the gap is between the two.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DropFill","date":"2016-03-18T19:27:36.102+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Quinn of Yuri,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=KVKbT1oU,comment-id=000000010000,timestamp=2016-03-18T19:03:51.630+0000)\n>\n> {{item:3001}} {{item:3060}} {{item:3157}} {{item:3027}} {{item:3040}} {{item:3116}}\n\nRod of ages does not give ton of offensive possibilities LOL.\nNor does banner of command.

The shield is not even that great and consumes your mana pool, so there is a instant trade off. No one even builds it nowadays.\nBanner of command is only bought in supports lol","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
