It's been fixed.\n\nNote: Oriannas wave clear requires two spells or poor positioning, and when used aggressively is fairly easy to evade. Lux's waveclear skill can be charged to do hit a wave that essentially isnt smart enough to avoid it, and when used to poke, it is increadibly hard to dodge even just the base damage, plus her passive can be dropped on top. I've never liked the skill, but I accept it for what it is. Lux is a support who can mid, she doesn't need a buff, unlike orianna or Morgana that have similar support functionality, they can't freely swap between the two lanes as easily as Lux can, or be a damage dealing support, or go mid and give massive shield buffs to allies in teamfights followed by ultimate. Have you ever faced a team with lux and morganna, or lux and jannah. The two are basically tanks with the constant shield drops and massive CC","replies":[{"poster":"TastyMmmYum","date":"2015-03-27T12:05:26.305+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Morgana swaps between lanes much more easily than Lux does.

Ever. Usually E is thrown in (or additional Q's).\nViktor doesn't use Q for waveclear. I think that's a typo and you're talking about E. E is not even *half* the cast range of Lux's E. (compare Lucent Singularity's 1100 cast range to Death Ray's 525 cast range). Really Vitkor should be classed a short range mage like Annie/Swain/Cass (but unlike those dudes, he builds pure squishy due to the durability granted from his Q)\nAhri I don't play, but usually when I see her clearing a wave, it's Q+W plus a bunch of autos.\n\nTwisted Fate's Q is a much better comparison for waveclear. I see it commonly oneshot the whole wave (or at least the caster minions) Although technically wildcards is entirely damage. It does not slow, it does not grant vision (I've killed a lot of people in the fog of war randomly because of wildcards hitting them which is why I know this).\nCassiopeia's QW+EEEEEEEE not only clears the wave, but gives % max mana back. Usually she stays at full mana because of this. this does require Cass to be farmed/fed to achieve.\nZed tends to build armour pen/botrk. neither of which enhance his waveclear than building flat AD would (armour pen doesn't increase damage against targets with 0 armour; which minions have 0 armour, and also BotRK gives 25 AD, which is tiny).\nLulu isn't even played solo lane anymore (or played in general), but her Q has a much lower mana cost (and also much lower damage, but a much stronger slow).\n\nLux's cooldown being greater isn't by much. Most of these abilities have cooldowns ranging from 15 seconds to 6 seconds. And Lux's E is a flat 10 seconds at all ranks (which beats most of these abilities through ranks 1-4 in cooldown). Even then, we're talking about a 1 second difference in most scenarios.\n\nIt would be nice if the base damage at rank 5 of lucent singularity could oneshot the caster minions.

Lvl 3 with small ap ( doran ring ) + game time < around 10 minutes, her W can kill ranged minions. At lvl 4, she won't need ap items at all to do it.\nAt later stage of the game, her W alone can clear a wave with some positioning to include siege and melee, and add her Q to siege one.\n\nLux require some change to be like that since unlike other mages who can combo their kit to wave clear, she don't have combo for wave clear unless you want to R a minion wave every 30 sec. ( you call her R as low cd skill ? Try Blitzcrank )\nAnd no, she don't have ability to clear entire wave since she only able to triggering her passive for 4 times depend on her attack speed which I think no one will build for her. \n\nHere is the suggestions for her E :\n- make enemy effected by her E receive more damage depend on how long enemy stand inside her E.\n\nReason : \nLook at Morgana, range minion keep standing still for entire W duration. Her W mechanic is a DOT with recalculation for bonus damage depend on missing HP, more dying = more damage.\nSo let's change Lux mechanic to some kind like that. Rather a DOT, keep her detonation control but allow detonation damage to scale depend on how long enemy stand inside the field. Example : 5 sec standing still = 100% more damage.\nNumber can be tweaked to be like Morgana entire W duration total damage. \n\nThis can help her damage output vs champs too.\nMorgana poke combo usually is Q + W.... and that's painful enough depend on Q duration and W lvl. She can continue with self E + R.\nLux is quite the same, Q + E. But without AA trigger which technically she need to do with her W on, the damage is quite small. \nOf course you can snipe with R, but once again, you need to AA trigger R effect for more damage. \nEarly game, triggering AA is quite less painful for Lux.

I know that you want to say, \"But she is picked as support!\"  Guess who isn't:  Lux, despite having MORE support abilities than Annie, while still being able to harass and CC from a distance.\n\nI want to say you misunderstand why Annie is being picked as a support. \nFirst she has a reliable point and click 1 - 1.75 second stun. In comparison. Lux has a skill shot snare.\n\nAnnie also wields much more potential damage Pre 6 and at level 6 her early game burst is insane. Unlike Lux, who usually requires to poke others down, and can miss her abilities.\n\nYou can argue Lux having a Shield as well would somehow make her better as a support, I guess? But her shield has a cast time and still has to reach a target, and it doesn't really have good base stats early making it pretty lame. \n\n> Lulu and Morgana are both common picks, and neither has any serious mobility. \n\nMorgana has a 3 second snare, a MR shield, an Ult that potentially slows then roots 5 people. Her puddle also allows harassment.\n\nMuch better then Lux. \n\n> Lulu can speed up, but that isn't really what we think of when we are talking about mobility being important.\n\nLulu is a champion that has caused people to yell profanity at the computer many times. And I am hoping I don't have to list all her awesome CC abilities and how they are better then anything Lux can do, Do I?\n\nAnd no sadly speeding yourself up IS mobility. \n\n> Orianna and Syndra have both been picked, though both are less common.  Lissandra has a little mobility, but it is predictable and easily countered if she tries to escape with it.  Just CC her and the ability ends without her using it.\n\nLissandra has mobility. Not \"little\" mobility. Mobility. Her team fighting potential is also massive, same with Orianna. \n\n\n\nAllow me to restate what I implied before. Lux isn't picked not entirely because she is immobile, it's because unlike the champions you listed if she gets caught or does something stupid that is it for her, she is doomed. \n\nAnd while you are thinking she has CC and a shield and blah blah, It really doesn't matter. She doesn't bring to the table what the other mages are doing, and that isn't a fault in her design. She is a long range mage, and does it well.","replies":[{"poster":"LeeDark","date":"2015-03-28T05:34:03.327+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I like how you go through each one, explaining how they are all much stronger than Lux...  WHEN THE FUCKING POINT OF THE THREAD IS THAT LUX IS WEAK AND NEEDS BUFFS.\n\nHer most direct comparison is one I didn't even mention, and is commonly picked.  Xerath, the long range AP artillery, who has spells that do more damage, with lower cooldowns, for less mana.\n\nSo, thanks, I guess?  You made a pretty good argument there for buffing Lux, even though you meant to say she's fine.  Perhaps you should organize your thoughts a bit better next time.","replies":[{"poster":"Silents429","date":"2015-03-28T06:15:14.446+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Weird I recall explaining why LCS players don't pick her, I don't remember saying she didn't need a buff or anything like that?\n\n> She is an immobile mage, of course she isn't going to be picked in LCS since all those idiots ever pick is the overly safe champions with escapes up the ass.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"slÃ´w","date":"2015-03-27T20:46:49.332+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She doesn't get picked because shes a middle ground champion, there are champions that clear better, there are champions that do more damage, there are champions that have more cc, there are champions that are harder to gank.\n\nshes also not so good against the current common picks and teams nowadays don't need her strengths and there are champions with less weaknesses.\n\nShe's in a good place in solo queue.
