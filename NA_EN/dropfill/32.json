If you get two shots, you'll do about 80% of the damage that an ADC who gets one crit and one non-crit, and it goes up slightly from there.  (Calculated using PD and IE on both ADC's).\n\nSure, the other ADC could get unlucky and get two non-crits there.  They could also get lucky and get two crits in a row and completely blow Ashe out of the water in damage.  The point is that because Ashe is guaranteed to NEVER CRIT on someone who is not under the effect of her passive, you will remain slightly behind in crit scaling.

Don't you think you could change your attitude a bit?  I'm not just speaking about Aventel, I'm referring to all those posts you've done where no one is particularly addressing you or even making a negative statement, and you just take it upon yourself to insult them.\n\n\nTell me, because i'm generally interested. When you press the 'post button' do you feel a sense of pride or enjoyment that you've condescended someone? I don't particularly, in fact as you said I only feel I am instigating the very thing I'm trying to prevent in the community.\n\nHopefully you read all of this and actually understand where I'm coming from and try to improve your attitude towards others a little, not just on league but in general. However if your ways will not be changed:\n\ntl:dr: I'll beat you with any champion in any lane on any map in any game mode.","replies":[{"poster":"Loco Little","date":"2015-04-29T14:38:26.262+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Edit/ fact checker: I just checked you on Op.gg since you took the liberty of checking me. Your silver 5 with a 50 ratio and have been there since the start of the season. I was silver 5 last week, am in silver 2 promos now with a 66% win ratio. Why are you even using that as an argument?\n\nAlso if you mean the LCS, you're talking about 0.001% of the community, not the whole region, such blanket statements.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
