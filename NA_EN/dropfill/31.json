It only works on base AD. I can buy as much AD as I please and it won't do a lick of good for making Iceborn stronger.

MR items were buffed and armor items with the exception of Deadman's Plate and Frozen Heart were also slightly buffed over the course of the preseason and season 6 (sunfire for example got buffs in 5.22, 6.1, and 6.3, and Iceborn was buffed for tanks in 5.22). That's a large part of why we're seeing tanks as such a dominant class right now.\n\n>They kind need the damage\n\nNot to the degree that they have right now. In high elo, almost every good top laner is a tank, and the best team comps are the ones that stack the most tanks. It's becoming an issue, and with the nerfs to the outlier top laners like Quinn and Trundle that dealt well with tanks, they're  dominating their competition. It's not an exaggeration to say that tanks are the single strongest class in high elo solo queue, and they're the ones driving the metagame there. You either play a tank, or you play a champion specifically designed to counter a tank. Because of that, they need to be taken down a little. On top of that, the rush items for virtually every game are Sunfire and Iceborn, possibly with a small amount of MR as needed. Given that tank itemization should be more responsive than that, it's a pretty clear place to start with small nerfs.\n\nJust to reiterate the earlier point, this is the context for the nerfs. Tanks have been complained about enough that they have nerfs targeted at them, and Ezreal is just collateral damage.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Irelia Bot","date":"2016-04-06T04:59:12.056+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"This seems like an across the board intended nerf to make people get Trinity if they want damage and IBG if they want the utility.
