Really, if you hit someone with the slow and then use E, it's pretty much the same effect anyway. \n\nHer damage against squishy targets isn't really changing much, the W changes mostly impact her clears and ability to fight other tanks. I think reducing her early clears a bit while still maintaining her incredibly strong teamfighting and rewarding good usage of her ult are all good changes. She will still be strong after these changes - they, by no means, dumpster her.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Meep Man","date":"2015-03-17T23:36:09.778+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This nerf isn't too big.
