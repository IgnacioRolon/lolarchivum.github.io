Gives him an assassin role, as both a cleanup champion and a \"bait\" champion.\n\n* Missing health poison damage on his Q. Fits his theme, and solidifies him more as an assassin than a \"sort've kinda duelist maybe\".\n\n* Slight shift in power to the on-hit damage on his E rather than the poison, or allow the poison to have \"stacks\" that increase the damage per tick, or give a current health damage effect (either poison or on-hit). At the moment, building attackspeed is only *sort've* good. It *seems* like it should be good, but raw AP and Pen, like a mage, are usually vastly more effective since the only really useful roles you have in a teamfight are \"lead them through shrooms\" or \"blind their ADC/fighter\". \n* % increase to poison damage dealt to blinded enemies.\n\n* Small buff to shroom reload time.\n\n\nPerhaps nerfs would have to accomadate these, but frankly, there'd be a REASON to have a teemo on your team. At the moment he has no use in a teamfight and is situational at best. This'd give him a role as both a \"pick\" assassin, who hunts down enemies who stray onto his shroom and assassinates them while they're separated from their team. This would also give him a role as an \"anti-frontline\" in teamfights, who whittles down the enemy team's hp before the fight even begins so as to either deter them from engaging or soften them up for an engage from *your* team.\n\nAgain, numbers would have to be specifically tuned, but I don't think the issue with Teemo is necessarily his power level, I think it's that there's *no team that wants the champion in their team comp*. There's no reason to choose teemo over a different top/mid/jungle.
