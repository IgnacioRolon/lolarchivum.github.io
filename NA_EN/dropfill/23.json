A moderate slow wasn't worth trying for and the damage increase was irrelevant because her damage is meaningless regardless of using her abilities perfectly. For the enemy players it was much more important to avoid being hit by the Q full stop than to avoid being hit by the empowered Q because the most important thing to avoid was Soraka getting health back, not the damage or the potential slow.\n\nThe sweet spot was removed because it was too impractical a mechanic for Soraka players to actively care about it (why would you focus on such a difficult to use slow/mediocre damage amp when you have much more powerful abilities that are significantly easier to use?) and the power of the Q being hidden behind something so difficult to utilise meant that it became a completely ignorable move altogether. Soraka cares a *lot* more about her Q now because it's more powerful in ways you actually care about and you can actually access that power with some level of reliability. \n\nWhen Q had the sweet spot mechanic, Soraka players never bothered trying to hit the opponent with it because it was just easier to sit back and avoid taking damage if you wanted to sustain yourself. It wasn't worth putting yourself in danger for a 10% (if not lower?) chance of a slow and a mild damage increase. Now that you know you'll get the slow and a boost to your healing off hitting Q, it's much easier to justify using it than it once was.","replies":[{"poster":"Nameless Voice","date":"2016-04-24T13:09:00.016+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When I played Soraka, I always maxed Q first, and usually consistently bullied my opponents out of lane with it by hitting the sweet spot damage.\n\nThat felt like a much more healthy pattern than before.

For the vast majority of her playerbase, maxing W first and using Q only when you wanted health back was the ideal way to play her laning phase. Speaking as someone who played her a decent amount just before and after the pre-season, I maxed W first exclusively for burst healing and had no interest whatsoever in poking the enemy out of lane - I could do that with significantly more ease with someone like Sona or Zyra.\n\nPerhaps if they'd increased the sweet spot size and made her heal bigger if they hit the sweet spot, people would have been more willing to take advantage of her Q, but removing the sweet spot altogether and making the wider part of the skillshot more impactful was probably a more fool-proof solution.","replies":[{"poster":"Nameless Voice","date":"2016-04-24T18:05:41.084+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem there was that both Soraka's self-heal and her ally-heal were both on W, so maxing W first gave you both sustain for yourself and your ally.\n\nThey shifted that around in her rework so that you need to max Q to get the self-healing required to refill your own health.  That alone would have shifted her more towards needing to max Q first and use Q regularly.\n\nWith her current state, I'd like to see the sweet spot introduced, and both the healing and the damage of the spell changed to be lower for non-sweet-spot and higher for hitting the sweet spot.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Jungle Lux God","date":"2016-04-23T21:49:26.385+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good luck sweetspotting Q's against an opponent that moves faster than Eggnivia.\n\nPersonally, I'd rather Soraka be able to spam Q's than have to aim them perfectly because it at least means I can engage on her when she tried to poke.

It isn't her self-healing from her Q, the slow applied by her Q, or the tertiary effects applied by Ardent Censer or the upcoming Athene's Unholy grail.\n\nThe problem is Ancient Coin.\n\nFundamentally, she's balanced around her W's health costs. She has mana costs that prevent her from spamming without a care in the world, yes, but they're hardly prohibitive and they'll be even less of a factor after the MYMU and the new items get rolled out. As a result of being balanced around %maxHP health costs, she has a lot of somewhat unusual interaction with stats. She loathes bonus health, because it increases her costs without granting her anything significant in return, and she loves sources of regeneration and healing, because they *directly* reduce the windows of vulnerability she has to expose herself to in order to keep going.\n\nIt's that last part that's the key.\n\nShe's amazingly frustrating to play against because when you start to win lane against her - say you're good at dodging her Q - she isn't forced to keep toying with you.

Aynthing that gives her massively increased health return breaks her risk/reward payoff structure.
