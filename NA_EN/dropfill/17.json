We see this every single time someone gets even the smallest possible buff, and they usually trend back down after a patch when those players stop playing the champion and enemies become more accustomed to playing against the champion. If those are still the same 2 patches from now, it will mean something. Right now, they don't.

She does not have this many strengths.\n\n>One of the best roaming capabilities (if not the best)\n\nEh. Gotta dispute that. She has speed, but she doesn't actually bring anything to a roam besides damage and very weak CC. I'd rather have an ADC roaming with either longer range burst or some CC to gank. She can farm side waves effectively, but there is a lot more to roaming than that. She's decent at it, but it's not a great strength.\n\n>Can deal with tanks without Bork.\n\nNot so sure about that. Tanks generally do fine against her because she's very easy to get on and just open her up to punishment from their teammates. She also doesn't have steroids that synergize with other ADC stats, which hurts her DPS. \n\n>Can be very slippery in a fight.\n\nNo she can't. She's one of the least slippery ADCs in the game. The strut on the W active isn't enough to make her slippery because of how quickly it gets popped in any fight. Any ADC that has any other form of mobility is more slippery than MF. Hell, a lot of the immobile ADCs that actually have good CC are more slippery than her. She's maybe above Varus or Ashe, and even that is disputable.\n\n>Never falls off at any point of the game. (she may not be a hyper carry, but she should not be ignored either.)\n\nYes she does. She's one of the weaker late game carries. It's not quite as bad as Corki's or Kalista's, but she's close behind them.\n\nThe AoE ult and the lane bullying are really the only things from that list I'd put as strong unique qualities. They're good, and the ult is kind of hard to replace (although some like Graves can take over her role very well in an AoE comp), but they are really the only unique things she has.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Yfrappefort","date":"2015-07-27T14:50:02.736+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sadly, there is still no reason to pick MF over other immobile ADC, such as Jinx, Sivir or Ashe. \n\nAll of them bring way more to the table then MF could ever hope (especially since she lost her grievous wounds).\n\nShe is simply outclassed, yet again.

To access the 150% damage in the bounce, you need to kill the first target. In Duels, Q is basically just an AA reset, and in late game, squishies die too quickly (either you or them) for it to be worth casting.\n\nYes, her mixed damage ramps up quite a bit IF you give her time. She needs 8 stacks of impure shots to deal the full 48% ad bonus (as magic damage), and chances are, that if the target isn't dead before these 8 hits, you're doing something wrong with your build. This is the reason why she falls off late game besides her weird scalings.\n\nHonestly, they need to lower the amount of impure shots max stacks back to 5 and increase the AD scaling of impure shots as you lvl R (to 50%), to reach a similar max damage output If they're not planning to rework her kit entirely like they did Tristana's. They're even tinkering with Kalista more than they did with her, sigh.","replies":[]},{"poster":"A Miss Fortune","date":"2015-07-27T03:26:00.411+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"I agree, that's one thing that Miss Fortune lacks and It's most likely what keeps her from being flat out broken, safety/self peel.

She clearly falls off late game, however you can be AD Janna and still instakill people if you hit late game due to how ADCs and their builds are designed. But imagine if Miss Fortune actually did have something like a dash, if she had just a simple dash, she would most likely return to her old state where she was pretty much always picked as an ADC and people wanted her to be gutted.
