Thornmail already negates more Lifesteal than can be reasonably build.\n\nMaths ahead:\n\nAn attack deals X damage.

This means he takes 0.4X damage.\n\nAn ADC with Bloodthirster has 20% Lifesteal, which means he heals 0.2 x 0.4X = 0.08X.\n\nOur carry bought an MR item, boosting his own MR to 100. This means he takes half of Thornmails reflected damage, or 0.15X.\n\nThe carry deals 40% of his attack's raw damage to the enemy's HP, and 7% of his attack's raw damage to his own HP.\n\nSaid carry even needs three big items to be able to take only 7% of his attacks damage himself - a Banshee's or GA for MR, Last Whisper for penetration and a Bloodthirster for the Lifesteal.\n\nTL;DR:\nThornmail isn't supposed to make an enemy carry kill himself. It is supposed to make him easier to actively kill by yourself, as it negates his main direct defense mechanic of drain-tanking.

Thornmail deals 30% of the physical damage from an enemy's attack--including Crit, but oddly not BotRK--before accounting for Armor's damage reduction. So, if the pre-Armor damage of their attack is 500, I reflect 150 magic damage at them, which is reduced by their MR. If they have 30% Lifesteal, 500 damage will also heal 150 HP, negating Thornmail's damage reflection.\n\nHowever, Lifesteal's heal is based on the damage *after* damage reduction, not before it. So, if I have 100 Armor and they have 0 MR--just as a point of comparison, I know that's unrealistic--then I'm reducing their damage to 250, and thus their heal is only 75 HP, while the damage reflection is still 150. They can either build another 30% Lifesteal, or 100 MR, in order to heal for 150 again or reduce the reflection's damage to 75. Or they could try a combination of ArPen, LS and MR to equalize it.\n\nThat's a scenario that will not actually happen, *but it still proves the point.* I could reapply this to a real set of in-game stats and scenarios, and it would still be true.","replies":[{"poster":"qetzel","date":"2015-01-21T13:59:21.287+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, I misinterpreted what you meant.

I'm not hundred percent on how everything interacts so I'm going to be simplistic for my own sake. Mistakes may be made.\n\nThornmail reflects 30% of dmg dealt as magic dmg. A fully AA reliant adc, let's take {{champion:18}} currently. At level 18 she has 1947 health. Let's take a 3500 health tank. Resistances don't matter. To kill that tank the adc will self inflict 1050 magic damage. Trist has a flat magic resist of 30 which offers roughly 23% magic dmg reduction. This means thornmail as is deals 808.5 damage to the target on its own. Compare a similar dmg tank item {{item:3068}} deals 43 dps in an aoe. To deal the same dmg as thornmail {{champion:86}}Ts you would need to stand by someone for 24.4 seconds. And unlike this item thornmail is cheaper and the dmg is will always be in effect unless the enemy jinx or Trist can somehow kill you with just abilities. \n\nWhat is more for an adc to damage you without taking thornmail damage they would need a lot of life steal. {{item:3072}} gives 20% lifesteal so to kill the 3500 health tank our adc heals 700 hp. Meaning thornmail still gets you a net gain of dmg for 2100g, basically giving an auto attack's worth of dmg if they made the 3500g investment to counter it which most adcs won't have by the time thornmail is made. Even more against champs like vayne who build {{item:3153}}. If it applied grievous wounds it would have the healing to 350hp over the whole fight. 808-350 is 458 dmg dealth to an adc who invested 3500g with a tank who only invested 2100. That is roughly 1/4 to 1/5 of most ad's health if the adc attacks you 100-0 even more if they didn't build lifesteal first which most don't. \n\nNow let's look at Garen's spell rotation for a comparason as to how much damage this passive is. Q deals 130+40% ad. About half of thormail dmg. His ult deals before missing health 525 magic dmg. About 1.14 thornmails dmg. So thornmail is like adding an ultmate to your spell rotation for a tank. Its passive damage can be almost as ridiculous as dfg's active. \n\nNow in closing I know vayne kog and other aa reliant adc have other non-reflectable dmg sources so they are definitely not crushed by this item, but no one should be killed for you by an item, I am simply trying to show is how effective thornmail actually is as it stands. Making it stronger, yet maintaining balance, would up the cost and lower its effectiveness as a quick investment against the adc. As well this would end up hurting other melee champs just as hard if not harder as unlike adc's, lifesteal is often one of the first investments an ad bruiser builds.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shadow Gilgamesh","date":"2015-01-19T23:38:44.388+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Absolutely good, since quite often you have people lifestealing around the thornmails damage.

Because of your 30 MR, you only take ~51 damage.\n\n*You're healing 22 and taking 51 damage, meaning a net loss of 29 HP per hit. In order to have enough Lifesteal to out-heal Thornmail's damage return, you would need about 35% Lifesteal, assuming Gnar doesn't build any more Armor or switch to Mega form.*\n\nAlso, fun little detail; Thornmail is designed to counter Lifesteal, not the other way around.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Vegas Dad","date":"2015-01-20T01:41:05.777+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"as a person that thinks adc are too strong, your suggestion is retarded, all the needs to happen is a reduction in all the armour pen items.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Random Task","date":"2015-01-20T00:53:16.307+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Bad allows no counterplay.","replies":[]},{"poster":"doubleguac","date":"2015-01-20T00:30:00.073+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Probably bad.
