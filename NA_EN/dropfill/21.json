Flash actually requires serious decisions because not having it up can be fatal against anyone who knows to abuse it, and it's very easy to waste it when you either didn't need to use it,  or it wouldn't have mattered.  Flash ultimately adds a lot of depth to interactions which is why it's ultimately a healthy thing for the game, which is why riot's never bothered reworking it and hasn't nerfed it in ages despite it being omnipresent on all but a few champs.  There's a difference between something getting picked up all the time because it's too strong and something being picked all the time because it adds strategic options.  This is the core difference between flash and thunderlords.

His base AD is surprisingly low (tanky melee champions tend to have high base AD, but Amumu breaks this rule) and he rely on E to constantly proc the passive, and he can't always stick reliably enough.
