They can wipe one person off the face of the planet, wait 7 seconds an drop another to half. Not to mention both have better CC in a consistency fashion. Leblanc has a slow, bind that relies on nothing else but hitting it. \n\nBrand needs a marked target for his stun, and no way to make the shot easier. The stun is nothing spectacular either compared to other stuns in the game, nor is the damage. Compare it to Ahri's charm for example.\n\nHeimer's has a giant tell and is much harder to hit in the sense that unlike a normal skill shot, it doesn't hit them if they dash towards it or run away. You have to predict for the exact place they would be at. \n\nThrow on that if they run away you are just boned and can't follow where as if you get engaged on you are just screwed unless you can 100-0 all of them.\n\nThe only character (imo) who has the burst, damage and lane control that is immobile and feels good to play (again, imo) is Ori cause she has a ton of utility on top of mass burst potential only reliant on her ball. but her ult has so much damage and CC that is immidiate, unlike Brand, Heimer, Victor(Victor does and doesn't, His CC is better then most imo but still not worth playing him over other options, and at least he has a movement speed increase and a good slow stun). Cass got number buffed until she was good even though I don't know anyone who \"enjoys\" playing her more then she is \"strong now\"(This is friends, not random people on the forum. Since its a better stat since smurf accounts and so forth). \n\nVeigar is getting changed in ways I dislike personally. Making him dramatically harder to play with less trade off. Which goes back to why Leblanc and Kass are just better, is because they can pick a target, and that target is probably screwed if you can't rip them off instantly. Same for Zed really. But Veigar no longer has the ability to pick a target and they are dead. No instant stun to give his dark matter time to land. No targeted q  so ignore the front line to pick a high priority target. No DFG ult combo. And anyone who can stack better with the new q(being a skill shot it will inherently be harder to stack, anyone who says other is assuming theoretically perfection that should be possible against any player of equal skill and since any good player should punish you for stacking it) probably had to put dozens of hours into play. And all for what? The double hit q, better mana costs(which were ruined by the mana changes anyway and is more ofa  fix for that) late game cooldown reduction(cause the game was hard cause of his late, not his early. So we made his early game worse) , and a debuff on his ult.\n\nVeigar might be good. I suppose with his skill ceiling higher there is the potential for him to do better. But honestly? Where is the fun in picking him? Again, I haven't played him. But I'm the type of person who ran the numbers on elise and knew she was good top when she was released. Who knew the Cass rework was going to feel utterly awful with the numbers on that and the mechanic changes. I like running numbers and running scenarios. \n\nAnd in all scenarios where counter play is added to characters with no mobility, characters with mobility become more unenjoyable to play against. \n\nI still come to these forums hoping to see changes coming that will make my favorite characters(zero mobility characters, including supports, and tanks) more fun to play, or more viable or give mobility characters weakness that matters. And Kass getting his ult changed is a start, but after 3 years its hard for me to care with just that. \n\nAlso Veigar getting played in the LCS after all this discussion on him felt timed so stupidly perfect. \n\nAlso to add on the fact Kass and LB win statistically less over the years, wasn't that due to Kass and LB both being so bad for a year and a half nobody touched them? Also heimer didn't have that high of a win percentage before his rework did he? Brand maybe, I don't know, but he's always been unfun to me because his ult just kinda goes where it feels like and his stun doesn't feel good or his kit.

I don't like that it feels like the enemy has full control over my ultimate as Brand. The dagger digs in a bit deeper when you're against a super mobile person and in addition to outplaying you throughout lane, if they get hit by your ulti, they can bring it away from their team.  I don't even know how often it happens but I do know the thought of it bugs me! \n\nAs for the winrates: forgive me for speaking very generally, but LB and Kass, even when they're staples of competitive play, don't necessarily win more than half of their games for we mortals in solo queue.  Heimerdinger, Brand, and AOE mages generally perform very well in solo queue. \n\nOri feels good and I normally classify her on the immobile end of the spectrum because she doesn't have a dash but her W grants her surprising movement.  \n\nSyndra follows the no cast time paradigm, and probably not coincidentally has been one of the immobile mages we've seen have a presence in competitive play.  Hard to say for sure how much of it was that bonus mobility and how much of it was a very dominant laning phase.","replies":[{"poster":"JC DarkOmen","date":"2015-02-22T07:21:14.742+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:63}} bring the bounces back up to 9 max, but with a base of 5 going up when hitting blazed targets? and/or make q go through targets? coughchoughignitehealshimandtocompensatenamicantcogh","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Sotere","date":"2015-02-22T07:53:06.435+0000","up_votes":24,"down_votes":4,"body":"You're onto something big.","replies":[{"poster":"JC DarkOmen","date":"2015-02-23T02:16:13.181+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"not to press my luck, but are you talking about the ult, the q, and/or the ignite/nami interaction? i would take that ignite/nami interaction over an actual buff, just cuz it'd be funny as hell. forget balance, lets go for lulz!","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Sotere","date":"2015-02-23T05:04:13.722+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"The main thing that jumped out at me was the Ignite interaction.

That's easier to do with a pro team's coordination (faker just blew someone up, time to force baron) but good luck herding cats in solo queue, or in a less coordinated 5.\n\nXerath plays the mobility game by being so far back he might as well have a dash, and Annie does well for the same reason anyone with a good teamfight ult does well; a flash beardrop is a glowing neon sign for her allies to 'ATTACK NOW YOU IDIOTS.'\n\nI think the biggest reason mobile champs tend to get a lot of complaints is twofold; first off, Riot is slowly phasing out targeted abilities, especially targeted CC, because it's low counterplay. That's kinda true, but it is basically the only counterplay available to mobile champions, since you can just point and click the LB and not try to play the game of 'is she going to dash? is she going to go back to her original postion? is she going to use her ult to dash again?' This tends to get Riot accused of favoring mobility because LC$BIGPLAYS and all that.\n\nThe other major reason is the aforementioned 'playing LB's game'. Whenever I beat a highly mobile champion, I generally don't feel like I won it because of what I did, but of what they did. I don't feel like I can act, but can only react; when I get a kill on a Yasuo as Cass, I don't feel 'haha, I have outsmarted you!', I feel 'you screwed that up BADLY, dude'.

I think we should lay some groundwork first.  I suspect you understand this following concept but I feel compelled to say it regardless.  When I give my opinion, I'm giving my own personal one. Sometimes I'll chime in with what the Riot thinks at large but more often than not, what I say is what I personally feel. Sometimes I get the impression that players think everyone at Riot is aligned.  We have a healthy(?) amount of disagreement internally on a number of topics, including some of the ones you asked about.  As a QA guy for the Game Systems team, a large part of my job is to give feedback regarding potential changes.  One of my biggest takeaways from my time here is that the first idea is almost never right. It takes a lot of iterations to get something up to the quality we strive for.  \n\nSorry for the big preamble. Without further ado:\n\n> \"disruptions(knock up/backs, stuns, displacements) have become too common and thus hurts champions with channeling ultimates\" \n\nLeaning more towards disagree. I liked the Galio change to not respect Tenacity with his ult, but generally feel like those champions can play around the interrupts.  I get to play with super talented Malzahar players, though (I don't know why, but internally we got a lot of Malz mains).\n\n> Or if I said \"Annie is too binary with her Flash+R combo\"...agree or disagree? Especially when her R is undodgeable.\n\nI agree that it's too binary, and I think our team has moved gradually in the right direction by making Tibbers more important outside the initial burst. Disagree that it's undodgeable.  But that's a personal pet battle of mine.  If you play footsies around the outside of her range and force her to Flash I think people can avoid it (although, as we saw this weekend, it ain't easy) by matching Flashes.\n\n> Or \"Brand has potential, but never fully reaches it\" or \"Brand could use something beyond just damage\"?\n\nAgree that he rarely reaches his potential.  I think he does add more than just damage: he has his stun and often itemizes towards Rylai's so he provides a ridic long slow.  Not saying we shouldn't push him even further in that direction but I don't know if he's as one dimensional as people generally think. \n\n> But lo-and-behold, it turns out this [Ahri] was one area we both agreed on\n\nThis is actually something that we wouldn't have been in agreement on. I liked the Charm pattern, because it is incredibly frustrating for me to see an Ahri kill someone without landing her skillshots, when she has mobility to put her at proper angles to land them!  Because of the latest changes, Ahri will probably fill her role better, and may be healthier long term. But if you told me the basics of the change being: giving her less damage but less reliance on Charm with more mobility as compensation, I would not have thought it was a good idea.  \n\n> Now if only we both agree that [Cassio] is just messed up hardcore as well...\n\nSo there were undoubtedly some mistakes made, but when I see the end result I'm not upset about it.  On occasion now, I see Cassio showing up in the LCS, hypercarrying!  That was kind of the dream.  On the rare occasion I play her I enjoy it more because I feel like I don't get 'cheated' out of Twin Fang combinations.  Our developers are talented, and generally have good vision.

From our perspective (which is primarily influenced by champion reworks, patches, and releases), it seems like this has resulted in a large number of abilities becoming skillshots, having longer cast times, or having charges/delays before you can benefit from the full effect. In a vacuum, this is a pretty neat idea; it allows a person to perform a powerful action, but also gives the recipient of that action some limited choices to outplay their opponent.\n\nThe issue is that mobility gives a champion a significant edge over their immobile counterparts under this new paradigm. A mobile champion can reduce the counterplay their abilities have by repositioning themselves (e.g. Lee Sin ward hops so his Q is undodgable) and can also drastically increase the counterplay that is available to them against their opponents' abilities (e.g. PBE Veigar throws down his E, so Zed just shadows away during the delay). \n\nAn immobile champion, on the other hand, does not have these tools. This often forces the immobile champions to play reactively, which is frustrating. Rather than having the ability or the tools to outplay their opponents, they instead rely on the mistakes of their opponents or help from their teammates. This type of counterplay feels extremely unsatisfying. Most players prefer not to subject themselves to this frustration, unless they have an emotional attachment to a particular immobile champion.\n\nFrankly, I think that the counterplay paradigm needs to shift. To become more satisfying, immobile champions need tools to proactively outplay their opponents, especially if their opponent is highly mobile. This can be done a variety of ways (e.g. changing the way mobility functions and interacts with abilities on a very basic level or changing the cast times, delays, and animations of immobile champions), but, unless something changes, immobile champions will largely remain unsatisfying and frustrating to play for the general playerbase.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot ShadowStorm","date":"2015-02-23T07:34:33.788+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"This was a great, well-written post.

An immobile champion, on the other hand, does not have these tools. This often forces the immobile champions to play reactively, which is frustrating.

Let's say I'm playing Lux against Zed. If I throw my Q first, he can dodge it w/ his mobility. So my proactive ability is pretty limited, and I'm forced to hold it for when he tries to engage on me, and only use it reactively. Ideally, you'd want Lux to still have some kind of proactive action she can take in lane, even when Zed's mobility skill is up.\n\nIs that a the general idea?

Ideally, you'd want Lux to still have some kind of proactive action she can take in lane, even when Zed's mobility skill is up.\n\nThe point is that non-mobile champs are suffering because of champions like Zed who can safely poke you, but reposition themselves because of their overpowering mobility.  It's worse with Zed because he doesn't pay for his power - he can harass through minions, spam his spells, and dodge everything you throw at him because he has no resource constraints.  \n\nThe same can be said about Lee Sin, another champion that Riot apparently doesn't like even mentioning when the community is around (huh, wonder why) who can also spam his abilities without constraints, and can overpower pretty much any jungler that gets near him because in the early game, he has built-in lifesteal to survive this hell-on-earth jungle and % damage to execute the poor unfortunate tank jungler who has nearly died trying to get the last buff camp to afford his expensive jungle item.  Then he goes to a lane and can ward hop away if something goes wrong during the gank.\n\nNotice something similar?  They both have too much mobility compounded with too much damage that they aren't paying for.  Look at how they've been nerfed as well...yeah not a whole lot happened to them while their competition have been turned inside out and reassigned to different locations or playstyles  while they remain free.  I could criticize Riot's favoritism here, but you seem to be one of the Riotors that aren't dismissively waving their arms at the problem and are actually interested in helping.\n\n>How do you feel about Janna in regards to your ideal paradigm? I consider her a largely reactive character, but she can make proactive plays with her Ult (particularly when used w/ flash).\n\nJanna is fine, just annoying.  She pays for her ability to keep people safe by having people that are willing to be kept safe.  On her own, she does pretty much nothing but float around and stop people's backing animation.\n\n>How do you feel about Morgana in regards to your ideal paradigm? IMO, she suffers from the same reactive-only mindset that Lux does, yet she's been a popular and strong pick for a long time now.\n\nMorgana is kind of like Janna, only she has a lot more power she can dish out.  Her strength comes from the 3 year long binds and teamfight stuns, but she has to build Hourglass or otherwise stay very safe because she's right in the middle of them.  What sets her apart from Kennen is that she gets the shield that makes Annie and Thresh players cry while getting a permabind on her Q instead of having to charge up a stun that doesn't last as long.\n\n>Under your ideal paradigm, does the requirement of proactive play extend to all roles, or just certain ones? And should it extend to all champs in those roles, or is there room for some exceptions?\n\nI'm not sure how to answer this one, but I'll say that you need to be careful here because of the risk of champion homogenization. \n\nEdit: Adding that similar champs aren't bad.  Graves and Lucian are similar but fill different roles while still being unique in their own way.  Making a champ like Kalista who can't be hit by skill shots, can't be touched by melee, and is a general rage-inducing monstrosity isn't good for the health of the game.  She should be more in line with what Twitch or Varus are, stacking burst carries - not a kangaroo that makes people want to punch a hole through their screens.","replies":[]},{"poster":"5G8Nri0B54","date":"2015-02-23T07:44:13.099+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot ShadowStorm,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=uRv66Z91,comment-id=0009002400000001000000060000,timestamp=2015-02-23T07:34:33.788+0000)\n> 1.

We've had absolutely no response to the feedback we've been giving on such random and unwanted changes to League.  Since the start of season 5, every patch has introduced a number of things that have caused anger and confusion throughout the community, but they will still go to the live servers regardless of any feedback, constructive or rant. What's worse is it seems like they are making changes without considering the opinions of anyone else but their own. \n\nLook at the jungle.  Who other than Lee Sin players likes it this way?  The early jungle is complete hell, and the recent smite upgrade cost increase has made it even *worse* for the junglers who were struggling to begin with!  Thankfully there is a system coming to the PBE that will allow us to show them the problems with it, but the thought remains; are they actually going to do something with our feedback this time?\n\nLook at the balance history.  Notice how many champions get nerfed while others who are actually a problem get off scot-free?  Champions are nerfed to oblivion and assigned different roles when they might be a slight problem, or there are those times (Cass) where there wasn't anything wrong with the champion to begin with, but it was insisted that the kit needed a rework that was brutally enforced despite the champion's playerbase expressing their frustration with it.\n\nThis brings us to favoritism.  They very clearly have favorite champions, and champions they don't like seeing.  That might explain why Lee Sin, Zed, and Kalista are allowed to exist the way they are while Sona was nerfed what was it; 32 times in the span of 6 months?  You have to agree that something like this is rather odd isn't it?\n\nHow about their emphasis on the pro scene?  When you think about those favorite champions, what are they doing?  They're making flashy and \"fun,\" plays that he audience will react to.  This seems to put more focus on the flashy playmakers still being able to make their exciting plays while the immobile champions with simple and 'boring' skillsets are being swept under the rug to allow more room for mobile powerhouses.\n\nThis mobility is a problem that has yet to be addressed, rather it is being promoted and enforced by having everyone and everything that moves have a dash or a blink following a rework.  When Ahri's transition from healthy assassin to unhealthy mage occurred following DFG's removal, Riot decided to slap mobility on her as if it was an appropriate compensation for her assassin playstyle being removed from the game for no reason at all.\n\nThey can say their philosophy for what an assassin is requires them not to have CC, so explain LeBlanc.  That kind of subtle hypocrisy is everywhere, increasing at an alarming rate.  As a serious question, when was the last time they actually followed their philosophies?

What I mean is that they\n\na) are only played by those dedicated to him\n\nand\n\nb) due to their rarity, often times people have no idea wth to do against them\n\nI actually played Swain top a lot and whenever the enemy is a Vlad, I'd throw my two DoT spells onto him and his response...is to pool away not knowing how useless that move is. People have no idea of what I can do with a Swain.\n\nTherefore I don't think you should ever trust data collected from rarely played champions, because if their winrate is low, it's because they're so bad even the dedicated players are terrible with them, or they're skewed up just because they have the element of surprise on their side.\n\n\n>  Ashe gets more assists on average than any other ADC (again, according to Champion.gg currently), and also has the highest win rate. Sivir is #2 in assists, #3 in win rate. And MF is #4 in both categories.\n> \n> I don't think that's a coincidence. Their teamplay is their strength, not their \"solo-carry\" ability, but I don't think a lot of ADC players gravitate toward this. The mentality of \"I'm going to help my team succeed\" seems more of a Support/Tank one.\n\n\nI think the distinction here is **TEAM RELIANCE**. Don't get me wrong, Kog'maw and Vayne are pretty team-reliant in their own way, as in they need their teammates to tank and peel for them.\n\nBut with these other champions, they are team-reliant in the worst ways possible. \n\n\n{{champion:22}}  needs a team who can pick up the slack for her lower damage, plus while she's great at kiting the likes of Garen and Udyr, a bit of slow isn't going to help one bit against a Jarvan or Talon where slow doesn't mean a thing against their gap-closers.\n\n{{champion:21}}  is overly-reliant on her R late game since her 550 range without any mobility or self-peel makes auto-attacking often an overly-risky choice, hence she DESPERATELY needs a CC-heavy team comp to accommodate her. \n\n{{champion:15}}  I haven't played her enough, but during the few times she is Free, I have noticed the frustration similar to playing Varus when I play Sivir. That being, I have an amazing Ultimate..........and it feels like my teammates are too stupid to capitalize on the advantage I just gave them.\n\n{{champion:110}} has issues too, but I personally think he's really powerful. \n\nAs for their high winrate...I unno, maybe I just suck and can't capitalize on their strengths. Or maybe teams are just better able to synergize and accommodate unique ADC's at different levels of play. I unno, all I can do is voice my displeasure that **Corki** can poke from afar and fly over walls if anyone looks at him funny.\n\n\nAnd that is the distinction. They are team-reliant like any other ADC's. **But their flavour of team-reliance, specifically their lack of independence, is what makes them feel especially inadequate** compared to {{champion:18}} who have long range, a leap, and a knock-back.\n-------------------------\n**edit:** Okay I just realized something after typing this. All three of them have theoretically powerful ultimates...**however they are high cooldown ultimates that are frustratingly team-reliant to really get the most of**","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"undEAdbUs","date":"2015-02-22T08:40:16.068+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"https://imageshack.com/i/idqmCWb2p\nLB was only one AP (except Bliz supp) in enemy team, so I stacked armor instead of resists. She oneshotted my Heimer in 0.4 sec. I have 100ms ping, so I had only 0.3 sec to react. Even if I had Zhonia it's not enough time to react. Btw I had full items set, while she didn't. So in teamfights LB can erase Heimer with speed of light, and Heimer won't be able to do anything with it. I had same problem with Fizz before last nerf - I could stack resist, get Zhonia, but Fizz still was killing me in moment. \nAs Heimer player I can say, stronger statistically Heimer is still very dependant on combo (his team and enemy). And most time teammates don't want to capitalize his power and picking \"more meta\" mobile picks which have bad synergy with Heimer. He's perfect with good duo or high elo where ppl know what Heimer is, otherwise in soloq better solo champions not teamfighters (because its \"solo\"q).\nWish I could watch this Heimer game outplaying Faker's LB too, because LB always was strong pick against Heimer.","replies":[]}]}]}
