Her damage is only decent if she goes pure ap, her CC has a huge delay, where people can just attack her.

The shield has very little downtime at top CDR (somewhere below 1sec IIRC, if it doesn't overlap) and she can effectively manage single targets and AoE both for damage and support.\n\nHer CC isn't great, but then Lulu might be the tightest CC a mage support gets-- most mage supports don't get great CC that isn't in their ults. At least Karma doesn't have to wait that long.","replies":[]},{"poster":"xWaters","date":"2016-09-29T03:17:12.654+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dude I love being supported by Karma.

It has something to do with the massive aoe shield, amazing peel/kiting and great lane harass.\n\nThe idea is that while her tether is counting down, she is facerushing the target with a huge speed boost, with the ADC following up, and the target slowed. Also great followup CC if the ADC can stun or slow.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SilverSquid","date":"2016-09-30T02:14:30.784+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a Karma main, let me tell you the following:\nI have played her in every possible lane and i will continue to do so. Your whiny opinion will not stop me - nor will it stop any pro for that matter - to continue successfully playing her support. \n\nThat being said:\nNo hard disengage, no hard CC, no hard stat enhancement, no clutch saves, low turnaround potential or playmaking ability. I guess it must be boring. \nOther supports offer more safety. Or damage. Or carry potential. She's got some of all. But I can see why you would prefer a specialist or a support with harder impact. Karma feels mushy to play with, and since her carry potential is usually in pure damage (her fun) or huge damage absorption (feels low impact), you don't get as many opportunities to shine, as you would with others. \n\nAgain, I do understand that you might prefer otherwise.
