At high elo, it is pretty hard to play as her, since people know how to counterbuild her early ( not even talking about counterpick, which she gets easily countered ).\r\nHowever, buffing parts of her kit that does not involves her ult would be awesome. Maybe mana cost reduction or a ad ratio on her W ( passive and active ) would be pretty nice.\r\nAlso, don't use her win ratio as a source of \" she is not bad, just look at her win ratio \" .","replies":[{"poster":"Dedrius","date":"2015-03-18T17:48:53.461+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fiora is fine how she is, the only problem with her is that she is feast of famine so she either gets fed and carries or feeds and is useless.

I used to play on north america servers, but the ping was way too high. This is my other account that I did not transfer to brazil.\nHer feast and famine style is a problem, because if she pushes the lane, she can't kill her opponent, assuming she is not extremely feed.\nTabi denies a HUGE portion of her damage, doesn't matter if you are good or not. I think she needs better scaling than just a atk speed steroid, or her W that gives way less AD than zed, and the active is pretty meh","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kapppaccino","date":"2015-03-17T20:50:34.946+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Change her e to armor pen.
