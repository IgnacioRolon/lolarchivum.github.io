You're going to be miserable the entire game.\n\nHonestly, the best example of perfect amounts of counterplay is the matchup between {{champion:51}} and {{champion:21}}.\n\nBoth have clearly exploitable weaknesses that each of them can capitalize on, and the match-up is 100% skill based.\n\nNow, not every champ is going to work that well.

I am not ok with laning against a Fiora.\n\nWith Pantheon, I know that if I make smart descions, I'll eventually outscale him, and probably be able to kill him if I'm more skilled with GP than my opponent is with Pantheon.  There's a possibility there.\n\nWith Fiora, I know that if I make smart decisions, at best I'll be able to farm effectively under tower, and at worst I'll feed her horribly.  Out of the couple dozen or so matchups I had specifically against Fiora, I've only truly won one of them, and that's because my opponent was wickedly inexperienced with her, while I have pretty much gotten GP mastered.\n\nTeal Deer:  Reworks aren't just thrown around, they're used for the most egregious of balance problems this game has or has had (see AP Master YI, old Critplank, old Soraka).  Riot doesn't rework because they just feel like it, they do it because there's literally no other option.  Soraka was always going to be useless or the unstoppable lane freezer.
