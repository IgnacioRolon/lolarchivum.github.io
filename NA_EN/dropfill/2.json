Don't remember much, but her Vitals mini game is much more fun to play with than what her old kit had.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Krys Star","date":"2015-08-13T06:02:52.371+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been having great luck with her so far, in Ranked especially, if you want to check my history out. I either build a Hydra or Trinity Force first, dependent of the match-up. Now that Lunge procs on-hit effects, TF works wonders on her. Especially with how low cooldown Lunge can be, if you land it on targets.\n\nSometimes, you just have to wait it out if the vitals are not in favor of your proccing them. Just because a Vital is there, doesn't mean you *have* to proc it. Resist the urge, unless it's in your match up. Her passive portrays her playstyle very accurately: dance. You just have to dance with the enemy with your Lunge and Bladework, weaving in and out. Riposte opens up many windows of opportunities for her as well.\n\nAlso, her ult does add damage. It adds four vital points, that if you proc, shred a tremendous amount of health from the target that they can not build against. She's a true duelist now, with the ability to shred tanks. Her team fighting is tricky now, however, but doable if you play your cards right. Her new kit requires a lot of patience and precision.\n\nYou honestly just need to think about her new kit, and process how it works. Also a friendly tip: Lunging into the enemy, popping their vital and using ONE quick Bladework, then retreating, has proven pretty effective for me so far. You can try to get in a second one, but they'll either try to retaliate against your favor, or run. In which case, getting a heal and speed up is good enough.","replies":[]},{"poster":"UltraSceptile","date":"2015-08-13T03:15:34.126+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think most common build now is hydra into cleaver/trinity force, lucidity boots, then there's a variety of shit you can build.

She don't need it. I don't bother with Warlord mastery either cause it's only like 5 damage. I always go for the weaving spells 6% damage, and the feast mastery for more crazy sustain.\n\nFor items, go like Hydra/Black Cleaver/Randuin/Visage/BT and boots can be CDR boots or Merc Treads. Though with Black Cleaver and Visage, that's 30% CDR plus the 5% from masteries. Unless enemy is mostly AD, then you can probly get LW/IE instead of Visage and get CDR boots.\n\nEdit: Oh, max order is no longer W, Q, E. Cause bonus damage on W went RIP. So it's more like Q, E, W.
