(no offence but in low elo any assassin will dominate, it's proven due to what smurfs usually play)\n\nZed has basically the most counters in the game, playing Zed against competent players is so fustrating because you almost have no one to ult at certain points of the game and he has the worst snowballing out of any assassin.\n\nIf talon gets fed he instakills anything while zed actually gives you a chance to negate his ultimate with many items, abilities and summoners in the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Minrog","date":"2015-08-16T09:11:17.107+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"You don't get 100% pick/ban in pro play for more than a year without there being something wrong.\n\nHe has two summoners that will negate him in a team fight {{summoner:1}} {{summoner:3}} .

You've done nothing to actually balance the champion.","replies":[]},{"poster":"NineTailedMystic","date":"2015-08-16T03:03:38.628+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"To be fair, you guys didn't hurt him too bad.

We may not be in the process of nerfing him at the moment, but he certainly hasn't been impervious to the nerfbat in the past.\n\nWhat do you think about the idea of moving some of his power from his lane harass and safety to his all-in (especially his non-ultimate all-in).\n\nIt's always really bothered me that the unique part of Zed's kit is his shadows mirroring his abilities, yet most Zed players ignore this because he has the damage to kill someone without having to drop W and try to get two hits of Q off. If you reduced the base damage on his Q and significantly buffed the damage he gets from hitting more than one on the same target, you'd make this theme more important while also reducing the \"strong manaless harass\" aspect of his laning phase that makes him so unfun to play against, *and* you'd reduce his reliance on his ultimate making him a somewhat more useful champion on the whole since he'd be less hard countered by items like Zhonya's Hourglass.\n\nThoughts?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DogIsGod","date":"2015-08-16T11:29:02.898+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":5,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Nameless Voice","date":"2015-08-16T14:33:23.771+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"He has counterplay *on one ability*, which isn't even the one most people are complaining about.\nIt's also counterplay based on an extremely long-cooldown item or even summoner spell, or on specific champion picks, which isn't really very good counterplay in any case.\n\nA champion who has that much counterplay?
