This is still a form of mana sustain since she can use it to last-hit and charge her passive easily.\n* Xerath gets mana back on autoattack, which is mana sustain.\n* Veiger has passive mana regen, which is mana sustain.\n* Malzahar gets mana back when a target afflicted with Malefic Vision dies, which is mana sustain.\n* Swain isn't that mana-hungry outside of his ultimate, so his passive is enough for short trading and harassment during laning phase.  Now that is returns a percent of his mana when he gets a kill or assist, it's good sustain in teamfights as well.\n* Regardless of Cho'gath's current state in the meta game, he still has mana sustain (which is the topic of this conversation).","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"SlytherinUmbreon","date":"2015-05-31T17:49:25.143+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:101}} \nAnd Lissandra doesn't have sustain, but her passive is close enough","replies":[]},{"poster":"DropFill","date":"2015-05-31T18:12:27.347+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Erockandroll,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=GskEzAbP,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-05-31T17:46:42.907+0000)\n>\n> {{champion:38}} {{champion:30}} {{champion:4}} {{champion:15}} {{champion:432}} \n> \n> all of these champions have a Mana Sustain in some form passive or active. and I'm probably forgetting a few.\n\nTF mana sustain is pretty bad.\nKarthus needs it because he actually uses a lot of mana.\nKassadin damage is horrible compared to cassio","replies":[{"poster":"Leu07","date":"2015-05-31T21:40:00.276+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=DropFill,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=GskEzAbP,comment-id=00000002,timestamp=2015-05-31T18:12:27.347+0000)\n>\n> TF mana sustain is pretty bad.\n> Karthus needs it because he actually uses a lot of mana.\n> Kassadin damage is horrible compared to cassio\n\nCassiopeia needs the sustain because she uses A LOT of mana!

At least compared to other members of the same class.\nRiven can deal a ton of damage - but it's in a pretty extensive, drawn-out combo involving something like REWQQQR, preferably with a few AAs thrown in to make use of her passive.\nCompare that to Fiora's QQR combo that does cost mana, and limiting the time-frame you need to cast things and reaction time for your opponents costs considerably more mana.\n\nIf you look at Cassi - she's more in the sustained damage department compared to your typical QWER wombo-combo mage, so having somewhat cheaper skills makes more sense in the existing mana cost pattern.","replies":[]},{"poster":"xJLx MCHammer","date":"2015-05-31T18:02:21.081+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cass has a play style like an adc so it's only fair to get mana refund and sustain when that kills something","replies":[{"poster":"DropFill","date":"2015-05-31T18:11:08.943+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=xJLx MCHammer,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=GskEzAbP,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2015-05-31T18:02:21.081+0000)\n>\n> Cass has a play style like an adc so it's only fair to get mana refund and sustain when that kills something\n\nwhat?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lucentile","date":"2015-05-31T17:57:52.634+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:31}}","replies":[]}]}
