Sure hitting a single Q does less damage now, but Zed's entire laning phase is about hitting those single Q's. He's not trying to nuke you, he's trying to slowly whittle you down with his endless resource pool until you have to back and he doesn't, so he can just free farm while you're gone, or roam while you have no health so he knows you can't follow. This change doesn't change that, it just delays it by maybe 30 seconds at best.\n\nAs long as he can poke you nonstop and never have to worry about mana, he's gonna keep winning lane.","replies":[{"poster":"Elikain","date":"2016-05-28T10:52:29.997+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Wait a second, you just contradicted yourself.\n\n>Zed's entire laning phase is about hitting those single Q's.

That was even before the Thunderlord's.\nAs soon as her damage got nerfed, she is no longer bullying people out of lanes.\n\nWhy do you think the same treatment for Zed won't work?\nHis poke nerf (-10% AD ratio and -5/-25 AD) does not lessen his poke potential?\nFirst of all, this impacts his ranged wave clear (if he doesn't want to take free damage from you) and then it impacts his poke damage. It stands to reason that you certainly won't eat every single of his shurikens which then means even more staying power for you in lane - aka he can no longer bully you out that easily.\n\nNot to mention that the cheapening of Zhonya's is also Zed's indirect nerf and you also have to that into account before making an argument about Zed needing to be nerfed harder.","replies":[{"poster":"Hinagiku33","date":"2016-05-28T12:02:36.660+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"You forgot this part:\n\n\"his endless resource pool\"\n\nShall we compare Zed's mana costs with Syndra's?","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"BakedLotion","date":"2016-05-28T03:43:04.847+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":5,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Slamurai Jack,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=AAF8X6yl,comment-id=000300000000,timestamp=2016-05-28T01:15:00.458+0000)\n>\n> You prefer Talon and Fizz?
