Changed entirely from a zoning strong CC champion to a void spam champ that had all his base damage and ap ratios reduced to support his W that seems to still be broken.\n\nWho will be the next? Aurelion Sol is already being nerfed too in the PBE, Lulu was nerfed several times ( even though I only liked playing her support ), Darius is not in a good spot. Don&#039;t even need to say anything about katarina who doesn&#039;t like any of the changes you did to items at all. Vladimir is TRASH, Swain is TRASH, all reworked in your \"Mage Update\". I still see a light at the end of the tunnel for Vel'Koz, but since we are talking about Riot Games, I don't know.","replies":[{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2016-05-11T16:15:24.163+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well lets be real here.  Fiora was basically cancer before her rework and is cancer after her rework so not much changed.\n\nMalz has problems I'll give you that.\n\nAurelion Sol is deserving of some slight nerfs, lulu has always deserved her nerfs.  Darius is in a pretty good spot actually, still wins most top lane matchups, is a beast in teamfights.  Don't know enough about Kat to comment on her.  Vlad and swain are just under tuned and need some buffs, the rework part of their changes was fine. Vel was barley changed but with the new items could also use some buffs.  \n\nThe whole mage update went pretty smooth all things considered.  I like the new items and all of the changes to the old items.  Most of the reworks hit the mark albeit a bit OP or UP in some cases.","replies":[]}]}
