And the new bruiser items that we know about at present (rage gage amplifies sheen procs too. That'll be nice. Probably not as nice as it'll be for irelia, though)\n\nlike I said, dunno.

And its not even that much of a nerf. Garen's ult is getting a ridiculous buff, at the cost of his q and w. Darius on the other hand actually has counter play now, but if youre stupid youre going to pay more than ever.

They moved his stun to his E, which still has its high cooldown, making it harder to stick to enemies. Current Skarner can stack his stun on multiple targets and doesn't have to rely on such a high-cooldown spell. Also, repeated Q hits give you less of a buff, and the shrines won't do anything 75% of the time.","replies":[]}]}]}
