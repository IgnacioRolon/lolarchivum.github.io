The shield items, for example, block more damage for a melee hero than a ranged one, and the Skull Basher item has a 10% for a stun to proc instead of 25% for melee. \n\nYou could apply a harsher penalty for Ranged using Frozen Mallet. Currently they get 30% slow instead of 40%. That's not a very big penalty for having such a large advantage as being ranged. 15-20% would probably be more manageable for some champions while still not outright removing an item for ranged champions. \n\nThere's honestly several problems that go into this whole thing than just the fact that Ranged can buy Frozen Mallet. When you remove certain features of a game you came from and then try to add things that were balanced because of the features you removed, you're going to have problems and will have to properly adjust. Turn-times were one of the things in DotA that kept ranged heroes from infinitely kiting melee heroes as soon as they got Eye of Skadi, in addition to Force Staff and Blink Dagger, or even Ghost Scepter so they can't auto-attack you at all (among kit differences between ranged and melee). When I look at League, it's honestly hard to say they've properly adjusted for the fact - having no turn-times as a ranged champion is a huge boon and has to be properly accounted for.\n\nIt's clunky, but it was important. League needs to help melee a bit more than they currently are. Permaslow isn't necessarily toxic in and of itself, but the fact is also that this game has absolutely no good counter for it which is another problem that wasn't caused by permaslow's existence.","replies":[{"poster":"tooomine","date":"2016-09-05T13:20:06.056+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"swiftness boots.\nmobi boots.\nQSS.\nyoumus active.\n\n\nlol","replies":[{"poster":"crippler38","date":"2016-09-05T14:35:59.629+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"in what world is mobi going to stop slows? it's shut down as soon as you take any damage.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Dengeden","date":"2016-09-05T12:09:36.046+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{item:3009}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Pika Fox","date":"2016-09-04T19:16:33.700+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"Which is good for the game, as it opens up different build paths than just \"BFS, Runaans/PD/Shiv, IE, Runaans/PD/Shiv/BT\" etc. You make sacrifices for whichever build you choose to take.","replies":[{"poster":"Critmaster Garen","date":"2016-09-04T19:24:55.421+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Pika Fox,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=89u6uzfN,comment-id=000000000000000000000000000000000001,timestamp=2016-09-04T19:16:33.700+0000)\n>\n> Which is good for the game, as it opens up different build paths than just &quot;BFS, Runaans/PD/Shiv, IE, Runaans/PD/Shiv/BT&quot; etc. You make sacrifices for whichever build you choose to take.\n\nwhat sacrifice exactly?\n\nthere is a point where a champion sacrifices too little (in terms of damage) and gains too much (completely shutting down his opponent by infinite kiting), to the point where the build becomes abusive.\n\nand thats not healthy for the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Pika Fox","date":"2016-09-05T18:49:46.864+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You sacrifice a metric fuck ton of damage if you go ghostblade > BC over the standard crit path late game. \n\nIf you compare the damage from the standard crit path and the korean build path at max items its not even a contest on the standard ADC.
