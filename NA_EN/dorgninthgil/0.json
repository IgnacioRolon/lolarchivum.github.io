The song doesn&#039;t seem to be on the League of Legends Soundcloud, so I was wondering if it was made available through other means or simply hasn&#039;t been released in mp3 form.  If it&#039;s the latter, will it be released sometime in the future? It&#039;s such an epic piece, and seems odd that it hasn&#039;t been put on the Soundcloud.  Any info is appreciated!","replies":[{"poster":"Chemicalseb","date":"2015-05-29T04:16:06.060+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's up on soundcloud now :)","replies":[{"poster":"Dorgninthgil","date":"2015-05-30T16:07:11.468+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Much appreciated. <3  Keep on composing great music! :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Guapomole","date":"2015-05-29T04:37:55.399+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Why will you reply to a post like this rather than to people with real issues with your game in the help and support boards?
