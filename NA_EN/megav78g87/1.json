It was somewhat random when this would happen and it seemed like I was lagging, however, I believe it was a server side issue. I had been plugged into the Ethernet at the college, and both my frame rate and latency ping were fine when this would happen. I noticed this happen again in a later match, and one of my teammate had mentioned that they were having the same issue. I could sit there spamming q,w,e,r and the game sometimes never registered that I was using the abilities. I noticed it a lot when I was playing zyra and when I would use my w, I would have at least one if not two charges, followed by q or e and sometimes only q or e would activate after a delay after multiple attempts to use the abilities. I noticed that there have been a lot of issues that seem to root back to riots servers, but it seems that rioters are hesitant to look into it more and feel that the issue is on the client side rather than server side. There seems to be some error that does not come up often, but when it does it prevents some commands issued from reaching the servers, because I was still able to move around when the issue popped up, but I was just unable to cast spells. I also will randomly have fps drops for no reason and multiple people seem to have the same issue. My fps could drop while I am just walking back to lane and be fine for a 5v5 team fight which is weird. The drops will only happen for a few seconds before returning to normal.\n\nI did have one unrelated issue where my latency ping shot up to over 10k+ and my game did not seem to immediately register that I was back in the game, so I had to look at my friends screen to see what I was actually doing while on my screen it just had me attacking a tower that was already destroyed, but I was not plugged into Ethernet for that match.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-24T19:31:26.207+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you're having a connection problem, likely packet loss which would cause input delays like that.

The logs for the matches that I had the issue occurs show up to have no issues with packet loss. One of them says it had ping issues but it was just 20units higher vs the normal amount when I am plugged into Ethernet. There is some packet loss and higher ping for matches where I was just using WiFi, which is understandable.

The client crashing no longer seems to happen, but this issue I did not talk about, as it did not happen at the time of the other thread. I just played a match and had random fps drops, but I think it was caused by something else this time as it was more frequent. And there was no packet loss occurring.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
