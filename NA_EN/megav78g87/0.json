Has this happened to anyone else? Also this is the first time it happened to me. I was using the legacy client since the new client still gives me some issues at champ select. While typing this post I was trying to start another match and when I was in champ select I was in the middle of typing when the client just closed itself again. I have never had this issue before and I do not know what is causing it. Lately my game will sometimes freeze at the end of a match right after a nexus is destroyed and resume after a long delay. I am not sure if that is related to the issue now happening to me or not, but I figure I might as well mention it just in case.\n\nEdit: Loaded into a match and was at 100%, but the client kicked me out of the loading screen and by the time I realized and tried to reconnect my team remade and I got put in low priority. I am getting really annoyed of this. Now I have to play 5 matches with 20 mins because the client crashed twice and kicked me out once.
