We lost the match and my game froze at the defeat screen, so I figured I might as well restart my computer since I wasn't sure if it was acting up or if it was my internet. When I loaded league back up I noticed that my username was not saved like it normally was so I had to type it in, and I went in a custom match to check my ping. Some settings, mainly my video settings were reset, and later when I played an actual game after I realized my item sets were gone. I checked after the match and all of them were gone. I tried to remake two sets from memory, but I would prefer to have my original sets back, since I spent a lot of time to make them. I had quite a lot of item sets, but I do not know how many I had. I really hope there is a way to get back the item sets.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-03T23:27:15.040+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like either your config data became corrupt or somehow inaccessible.  If it's gone missing then there isn't a way to retrieve it unfortunately.  Your best bet would be to first reset your config so this doesn't happen again:\n\n **Log into the game** then hop into **a custom game**. *Alt+Tab* out of the match, then navigate to your League installation folder, which should be in C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\n\nDelete the folder named **Config**\n\nOnce you've deleted the folder, leave the custom match. You'll then want to hop into another custom match to confirm the changes were saved.\n\nYou'll then have to redo your lists, bindings, and options from scratch.  The reset will resync to our servers so it should be there when you login again.  I hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
