Seems to be happening when you leave the runes page and then save outside of Runes.** To get it to stop playing, go back into Runes, click a page and then exit. It should stop playing! I'm working on getting a fix for this ASAP!**\n\nEdit - looks like we can piggyback the fix for this when we do a patch for when we find something else that is inevitably broken with all the new Runes stuff that went out. In the meantime, what I wrote above should be a way to stop the ambience! Really sorry about it :/","replies":[{"poster":"Insidious","date":"2017-11-10T00:45:20.791+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for this, it was infuriating having to disable all sounds in the client to get it to stop, missed a few queue pops haha","replies":[]}]}]}
