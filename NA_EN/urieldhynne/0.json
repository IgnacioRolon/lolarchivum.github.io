Tanks go straight into a fight, have natural survivability, sustained damage patterns, team utility/CC and are usually not attractive targets to try and take down if you've got any better options. Assassins by contrast tend to flank, have extremely high target selection and burst, low team utility, lack constant survivability (instead relying on other tools like mobility, untargetability, stealth etc) and are usually great targets to kill if you can focus them. **Combining those two categories risks creating very tanky, mobile champions with high CC/utility that set up their own kills, are extremely hard to take down and will happily chew through an entire team.**\r\n\r\nTroll Rito at his finest. \r\n\r\nhttp://www.surrenderat20.net/2014/12/red-post-collection-extra-bonus-rp.html","replies":[{"poster":"Kowe The Ewok","date":"2015-01-02T16:49:47.643+0000","up_votes":28,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, so why did they decidethat Eve should be a tank/assassin?

Your opinion counts. You dont need to be an expert to know if i tell you that lee sin has almost all the mechanics of the game in his kit (without using items) that makes a big difference between him an the rest. The problem is that lee can be tank, can do dmg, can escape, can cc, can heal, can shield, slows, reveals invisible units, attack speed, energy regen and maybe i forgot something else. Youre right lee is popular, most people see the tournaments and begins to use champs that actually are played in the finals or by high elo teams. Lee is the case. And its getting worst because they dont fix lee sin (not the only one). Rito release champions that are closest to lee (Riven for example). Its a dangerous move because the game can transform in something chaotic that you cannot control anymore. Changes to the jungle (the importance of dragon, the buffs all focalized in dmg are signals that indicates the game is going that way). It can work?. Yes, of course it can... But im still dont understand why if you try to follow the dmg way, you tell me that making shen tank assassin can be a problem... The example is very clear. The game today is all dmg focused, shen´s ult many times is wortheless because you are dead before he teleports to your location and this is happening in this Season.

You see your adc getting ready to fight in lane, you head down.  You ult down getting maybe a kill, maybe not.  If you don't, you went down there for a little farm if the adc lets you.  Then you realize that riven or whatever stupid fast pushers are laning against you, have pushed two waves worth of experience and gold.  One if you take teleport, which is required, but stupid because you can already go anywhere with your r.   But if you don't take it you lose lane if a gank bot at level 6 doesn't work.\n\nThat means that you can't take battle spells like exhaust or ignite because of teleport, and the increasingly important flash spell.\n\nNot to say he isn't good in a coordinated team.   Eventually he gets so tanky that it doesn't matter.  It just feels like his e is a better spell than his r.  If I wanted to play a character to support the adc, I would have picked something like lulu or kayle, who have better support ults than uber tank shen, and sticking bot most the game means.\n\nThis is a good idea though.  What if shen dropped a blade anywhere on the map, that gave a smaller shield in an area around it, that he could jump to if he needed to with the channel.  And if someone clicked on the blade they would switch spots with him.  That would send someone top to take the farm and exp and keep the lane from over pushing, and shen could take the place of the support.\n\nThat would be wicked and could even be used in team fights to allow an adc to re-position himself.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Urieldhynne","date":"2015-01-02T17:59:32.010+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"I used to play a LOT Shen, a lot.
