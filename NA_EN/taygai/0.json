I like that in dota 2 that you can either gank or farm the jungle and be useful later. Far more than in LoL. In LoL junglers are basically required to gank to put pressure on lanes. I don't see that's wrong, but I wish we had more options as a jungler. \r\n\r\nWhat if we had a reward for stealing the enemy jungle camps? Or destroying wards? Or not even touching an enemy champion until a later stage? You can say that destroying wards destroys vision. That's not wrong, but what if we gained a permanent stack? Or extra gold? \r\n\r\nWhen riot announced they wanted more ways to end a game for season 5, I was excited. In dota 2 you can end a game by just destroying the enemy team in fights, split pushing, controlling the map, pressuring their base all game, everything. In League we have that now, to an extent. I like options, and how they're giving us more. I'd like them to see if they look more to the jungle though. Cinderhulk was an amazing improvement for tank junglers.\r\n\r\nCan we look to farm junglers now? Carry junglers? Perhaps maybe one day we'll see ADC's in the jungle, or we'll see tryn, master yi & fiora jungle again. Or ironically, we won't see them until they come out with ALOT of gold.

I love variety in anything. \n\nIt's about counter-play.\n\nThe idea of counter-play is that a mechanic/gameplay element in a PvP game should be as engaging to have used on you as it is to use yourself. Generally speaking this is accomplished by giving opponents a few options to deal with a thing (where not playing the game isn't an option considered for this).\n\nThe issue with feeling awesome about getting fat in the jungle is it sucks for everybody else in the game and there's nothing you can really do against it. Besides counter-jungling, which is so risky at the moment it's not a counter so much as either voluntarily countering yourself, or something you do when you're really fed to rub salt in the wounds of your opponents.","replies":[{"poster":"Taygai","date":"2015-03-20T19:54:31.388+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":5,"body":"But good counter junglers such as lee sin, shaco, even nunu, are great at that.

Purple smite is for making farming faster and keeping you sustained.  White smite is for jacking the opponent's stuff and getting out quickly.  There are design challenges to making both of these playstyles as useful for competitive play as ganking playstyles.\n\nWhen farming as a strategy is strong, it is riskier to counter it than it is to perform it.  That's always going to limit the upside of the thing.\n\nCounterjungling is risky to start, and has good counterplay mechanics, but it can easily snowball out of control.  That's the main design challenge to enabling counterjungling as a dedicated strategy, rather than an opportunistic thing.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"TomA3X","date":"2015-03-20T20:19:19.756+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pretty sure one of the jungling items gives you gold for counter jungling, not sure, but i think so.
