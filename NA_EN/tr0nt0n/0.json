There can be a little expection while it's not a basic, regular deal. They're left alone in whole universe. It never happened.\n\nAlso it's confirmed, they have an end.","replies":[{"poster":"Chromatic Eagle","date":"2015-10-08T20:23:21.016+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How is that confirmed?
