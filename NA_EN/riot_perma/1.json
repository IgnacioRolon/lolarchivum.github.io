{"poster":"Riot Perma","date":"2018-06-16T01:12:18.820+0000","title":"Game client anti-cheat known issues and fixes","subforum":"Report a Bug","up_votes":54,"down_votes":261,"body":"Hey everyone,\n\nWe've collected a list of known issues that we are tracking now that our anti-cheat solution has rolled out to North America. We've also compiled a list of common fixes that can remedy issues you may be encountering, based on the reports that we've reviewed so far. We'll continue to update this thread as we know more.\n\n**Known Issues**\n\n- Players with an AMD FX/Opteron (Bulldozer family) processor experience very, very long load times followed by unplayable frame rates. This may manifest as black load screens seeming stuck for some players. Make sure that you have the most up-to-date firmware (update your BIOS to the latest version) from your machine's manufacturer, as we have confirmed that this fixes the issue.\n\n- The following software products are currently incompatible with the anti-cheat. Removing the software remedies the issue. We are currently working on identifying the exact problems.\n   - [Xunyou](http://www.xunyou.com), a Chinese tunnel accelerator, is not compatible with the changes in League of Legends. You can remedy this by removing this software, following these steps:\n       1. Uninstall Xunyou.\n       2. Verify that it has been completely uninstalled by making sure that xunyount.dll has been deleted from _C:\\Windows\\System32_ and _C:\\Windows\\SysWow64_.\n       3. Run an elevated Command Prompt as Administrator (except Windows XP, where a Command Prompt window will suffice). You can do this by right-clicking the Command Prompt icon and selecting Run As Administrator.\n       4. Type this command: _netsh winsock reset_\n       5. Press enter, then restart the computer.\n   - [Backup Now EZ](http://www.nticorp.com/NTI-Backup-Now-EZ-6-cloud.html),  a backup solution bundled with Toshiba external hard drives, can cause the game to crash. The latest version of this software does not appear to cause this issue.\n   - [Spybot Search and Destroy](https://www.safer-networking.org/), an anti-malware service.\n   - [Huorong Security](https://www.huorong.cn/), a Chinese security suite.\n   - The FPS counter feature that is installed as part of the Razer SwitchBlade OEM software may cause the game to crash. This does not happen with the latest Cortex overlay software from Razer.\n   - [RivaTuner](http://www.guru3d.com/content-page/rivatuner.html), display adapter mod software.\n\n- Some players unknowingly have kernel debugging enabled which will cause the game to freeze or crash, by design. To disable it, follow these steps:\n    1. Run an elevated Command Prompt as Administrator. You can do this by right-clicking the Command Prompt icon and selecting Run As Administrator.\n    2. Type this command: _bcdedit /debug off_\n    3. Press enter, then restart the computer.\n\n**Common Fixes**\n\n- Make sure that your anti-virus or security software is up to date. We have seen a number of reports with very old versions of anti-virus software that are no longer supported or that have newer, compatible versions.\n- If you run the game in a virtual machine, you must do so with GPU pass-through technology. The game will not run in any other virtual machine configuration. Please see [this post](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report/GX3Zhxwe-game-client-anti-cheat-known-issues-and-fixes?comment=00020008) for more information about our rationale behind this decision.\n- Do not run the game with a kernel debugger enabled. This will cause a game crash or reconnect loop.\n- If your game client refuses to patch after using one of the test executables that we provided, you may need to repair your installation before trying to patch.\n\n**Issues Fixed**\n\n- Some anti-virus software (such as Comodo Internet Security, Avecto Privilege Guard, etc) would cause the game to crash on startup. This issue should be addressed by patch 8.13.\n- Players were experiencing lag spikes 5-15 minutes into the game. This should be addressed by a hotfix applied at 10:30 AM PST, Friday, June 15.\n- Stuttering or hitching was appearing for some players throughout the game. This should be addressed by a hotfix applied at 7:30 PM PST, Thursday, June 14.\n\n**How to Create a Dump File**\n\nAs we work on diagnosing issues, we may ask you to provide a dump file which will give us a lot of insight into what's causing problems for you. We would really appreciate it if you could provide these dump files to us whenever possible. You can do it by following these steps:\n\n- If you receive a critical error message that offers to generate a dump file:\n    1. Select _Yes_ to generate a dump file.\n    2. Select _Yes_ again to generate a full memory dump. This is preferred. If you would like to generate a smaller dump, select _No_, but note that this may not contain the information we need to diagnose the problem.\n    3. Zip the file.\n    4. Upload the file that is generated to a file hosting service like [Dropbox](http://www.dropbox.com) or [Google Drive](http://drive.google.com).\n    5. Make sure access permissions for the hosted file are set to _Public_, so that we can view it.\n    6. Link the dump file in this thread, providing a description of your problem with as many details as possible.\n\n\n- If you do not receive a message, but want to create a dump file:\n    1. Open Task Manager.\n    2. Right-click on the _League of Legends.exe_ process (not the Ux processes) and select _Create Dump File_. This is the \"League of Legends (TM) Client\".\n    3. Zip the file.\n    4. Upload the file that is generated to a file hosting service like [Dropbox](http://www.dropbox.com) or [Google Drive](http://drive.google.com).\n    5. Make sure access permissions for the hosted file are set to _Public_, so that we can view it.\n    6. Link the dump file in this thread, providing a description of your problem with as many details as possible.\n\n- If the game closes immediately without giving an error message, and you're unable to generate a dump before the League of Legends.exe process closes, follow these instructions:\n   1. Download the [procdump.zip](https://github.com/mvankuipers/tools-dump/raw/master/procdump.zip) file.\n   2. Extract the contents of the zip file to your desktop or folder of your choice.\n   3. Right-click on _setup.bat_ and select _Run As Administrator_. (Alternatively, you can start a new instance of the Command Prompt by right-clicking on it and selecting _Run As Administrator_, then navigating to the folder containing _setup.bat_ and executing the command _setup.bat_.)\n   4. The prompt should say that _procdump.exe_ has been set as the just-in-time debugger.\n   5. Join a custom game or practice tool to launch the game again.\n   6. If the game crashes, one or more new _.dmp_ files will appear in the folder where you extracted _setup.bat_ and _procdump.exe_.\n   7. Upload the dump file(s) to a file hosting service like [Dropbox](http://www.dropbox.com) or [Google Drive](http://drive.google.com).\n   8. Make sure access permissions for the hosted file are set to _Public_, so that we can view them.\n   9. Link the dump file(s) in this thread, providing a description of your problem with as many details as possible. Be sure to include the names of any security or third-party software you're using.

We want to give affected players some context on the situation. Virtual machine usage comprises a fraction of a percent of League of Legends players globally. The overwhelming majority of these are bots. Furthermore, virtual machines expose highly sophisticated tools for developers to debug, analyze, and reverse engineer software. This is by design as VMs are typically an important part of operating system development. Game hackers can leverage these powerful tools to circumvent our anti-cheat technology, undermining the competitive experience for all legitimate players.\n\nWe recognize that there is a passionate, dedicated base of players that have worked to ensure they can enjoy League of Legends on unsupported operating systems. With that in mind, we've decided to restore virtualization functionality in today's patch to folks who are using GPU pass-through technology to play the game in a virtual machine. However, we must be clear: we maintain our decision to **disallow all other types of virtualization**. We've decided to consciously allow this single use case and not others as it strikes a fine balance between security and functionality.\n\nFor players using Wine, the community is already at work fixing incompatibilities with our changes. These changes were live on our Public Beta Environment for several months to give developers of third-party applications time to adapt. As a normal part of software development, especially with such comprehensive changes, there can be issues introduced with third party applications. We have not consciously prevented the use of Wine for playing the game, and we ask for your patience as the Wine community remedies any incompatibilities.","replies":[{"poster":"xAsKaNx","date":"2018-06-26T21:16:48.484+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":2,"body":"I'm playing from Linux only.

I can play CS:GO or other games (have around 30 games on Steam. All run fine on Linux **natively**!).\n\nYou say that \"The community is already at work fixing incompatibilities\" but it won't work this way. There is a bug with noone knowing what you did and why nothing works now. It may take weeks or even months before someone will figure this out. And what happens if they do? Will you change your \"Anticheat\" again?\n\nPlease offer your help (registering to their Bugzilla doesn't take that much time!)\n\nOr even better: Check if it is an option to port your existing Mac client to Linux. Both systems use (or Mac used) OpenGL for rendering.\n\nBTW: I've asked everyone, I know, who is playing LoL. Noone ever noticed a cheater in LoL! So why forcing an Anticheat feature if it effectively makes the game unplayable for a part of your userbase if cheating doesn't seem to be a that big problem?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Magical Mobus","date":"2018-06-19T22:46:10.192+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":2,"body":"Thank you so much for addressing this.  I am really glad to hear that you're willing to work with the community to get this fixed.  I understand it can take some time, it sucks but as long as you're willing to work with us to get a fix in, that's great.  I can't wait to start playing again when it's ready.\n\nOn a side note, it would be really great if you could work on a native GNU/Linux port.  I know it's a non-trivial task, but it would be better in the long run for the gaming ecosystem to not stay tied to the Windows \"ecosystem\" (more like a zoo really).  League of Legends is still a giant presence in the PC gaming space, and a native GNU/LInux port would go a long way to break our dependence on Windows.  And, for every person that's going through the pain of running League in a VM or WINE, I would bet there's two more that would be willing to use GNU/Linux if only there were a native port for League (I was one of them for many years before 2015 when I finally got everything I needed working on GNU/Linux and didn't need Windows anymore).\n\nIn any case, thanks for being willing to work with the community to try and come up with a fix for this.","replies":[]},{"poster":"urmamasllama","date":"2018-06-19T18:55:15.761+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"To clarify does this mean that the anti cheat is now looking for the presence of specific hardware IDs? or is it looking for hardware utilizing specific drivers?

It continues working after the bootup, facilitating communication between the OS and the hardware.\n\nAlthough you can update today's BIOSes, doing so is more dangerous than updating drive-based software. If something goes wrong, it could render the PC completely unbootable; you won't even be able to boot a live Linux flash drive or reinstall Windows.“\n\nSo, you’re trusting average user of your game (some assume the average age of the player base is 18-24) to know how to flash their bios CORRECTLY without screwing it up and bricking their computers. I get you guys want to stop scammers, hackers, and unauthorized third party programs, but I fail to understand why you don’t provide a guide that tells people how to CORRECTLY flash a bios. Who’s responsible if they brick it? You? Nah you’ll default to “user error” but you told these people to do it to play your game. \n\nI left the volunteers for this reason. I lost faith in a company that lacks common sense and the decency to listen to their playerbase. I knew some great people who resigned from riot and the volunteers who busted their butt for the community. Frankly, I know this won’t get anywhere because it’s the boards and you guys would rather use reddit, but I hope I can educate the people here to be careful and not blindly do something to play a game you like.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shifted Society","date":"2018-06-16T21:40:39.643+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":1,"body":"Perma disconnects on MAC client every game or so (two times+ a game)\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}}\n\nEver since 2013 BTW\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}} {{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}} {{sticker:sg-shisa}} {{sticker:sg-zephyr}} ","replies":[]},{"poster":"antjr24","date":"2018-06-17T05:02:08.765+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"oh man, I thought it was just me that couldn't get on.Thought my wine config had messed up but i guess it was every linux user, well hope they don't expect us to go install windows to play lol.

My  problem was that can't load into game after champ selection, and now I know it's caused by 'Huorong Security', a HIPS/Anti-virus software. \n\nI can load the game without any issue if I turn off Huorong, otherwise will see reconnect loop. On the system task manager view, I can see the game process started normally with huorong off, but when huorong is on, the game process will end once it gets executed. Still not clear is the game process terminated by huorong, or closed by the anti-cheat function due to the detection of huorong. But I guess the anti-cheat function must  need some deep system control action, like kernel, driver or hooks, so there may be conflicts with some HIPS/Anti-virus software like huorong.\n\nSo far, I haven't found a real solution yet, what I have to do is just to turn off huorong during game time. For players who also have this issue, if all otehr fixes don't work, try to disable all HIPS/Security/Anti-virus software first and then load the game, this may help.\n\nI also found a post talking about this issue on huorong official support forum, if you want to read it, it's in Chinese:\nhttp://bbs.huorong.cn/thread-47326-1-1.html\n\nRioters, if you need more information, please let me know. Hopefully the issue can be fixed ASAP.\n\n\n# Update 20180602:\n\n1. The latest game client files solved the problem! I downloaded the latest client file (deploy_39ab702.zip) and replaced those on my computer, now I can load the game successfully without turning off Huorong! \n\n2.
