It devalues actual intentional feeding, and makes it hard to distinguish between the two. Frustrated players might think \"don't say that I'm inting when I just have a bad game or I will show you what inting means\".\n\nIn many cases, people just snap and stop caring for the rest of the game, and want to take revenge at their team mates; flamers are often the reason for this. While I don't think that getting flamed justifies feeding at all, and everyone should just mute and report flamers, I think that flamers are much worse than feeders and I can sympathize more with feeders than flamers (but I don't think it is ok to do either!). Most people who feed intentionally (which already happens very rarely) just don't want to take the harassment anymore.\n\nLooking at your post, I get the impression that you might (possibly) be partly responsible for people feeding in your game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"NoPaxt","date":"2018-02-13T23:16:27.132+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if by inting you mean feeding than sure...\n\ninting isn't a thing, not a reportable thing anyway.","replies":[]},{"poster":"gabetheguy","date":"2018-02-13T22:43:47.969+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"maybe if you didn't tilt them so often you wouldn't get them to int so consistently","replies":[]},{"poster":"Warios","date":"2018-02-13T22:12:51.266+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I looked at the kill map, your team took out one tower, the Lucian died inside the inhibitor turrets three times,  Brand died to the nexus turrets once.\n\nSo I believe you that these 2 players were trolling and yes did INT.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-02-13T22:06:25.900+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Inting is, however most of what people think is inting is just someone having a bad game or being trash at league.
