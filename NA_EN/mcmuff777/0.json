I got to gold 5 then dropped out of gold 5 and my game is now ruined. I lost 7 games in a  row and dropped to silver 1 and then i got back into gold 5. Ive been i gold 5 for a very long time now and im about to never play this game again. I get 14 LP per win and lose around 24. But I&#039;ve won way more game this time in gold 5. I won 5 games in a row and i was still getting 16LP and then i won 4 games in a row and i was getting 14 LP. I lost a few games here and there but please look at my op.gg. Ive won probably 65% of my games in gold 5 but that isnt enough to climb i guess? Imagine winning 5 games in a row then losing 2 games and having 7 LP. The thing that is pissing me off is my MMR isnt low. After i won 4 games in a row my MMR was gold 4 and yet i was getting 14 LP a win. Also what youll probably notice is a have a lot of duo games and i swear to god if another PLEB says thats the reason why im gonna go nuts. I won 4 in a row solo and this occured, then i won 5 in a row with 4 of the game being duo and the same thing happened. So thats clearly not the issue. Someone please explain how the LP system works and feel free to look at my op.gg at its a mystery. Thanks for your time.","replies":[{"poster":"Honest Player","date":"2018-03-05T22:54:18.826+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem is the amount of games you've played. You've played so many games with roughly a 50% winrate that it would take a drastic stomping spree to get decent gains. The system will keep matching you with people that are around or lower than your elo until you can consistently beat people with higher MMR than you. Losing three games in a row to people with barely higher MMR than you will destroy your gains.\n\nThe higher your winrate over a large amount of games will help your LP gains level out. It's very likely you are at the elo you should be at if you're 400 games in with around a 50% winrate though.\n\nTLDR: You're so many games in changing your MMR and thus your gains would require a major winrate (70% or higher over a large amount of games)","replies":[{"poster":"Mcmuff777","date":"2018-03-05T22:59:24.801+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"THANK GOD FOR THE ANSWER. This actually makes so much sense too. When i first got into gold 5 i literally went like 3-15 and my winrate sucked. But when i entered gold 5 i had a 56% overall winrate and it dropped the lot when i got into gold 5. But after dropping out and reentering i now have like  a 65% winrate in gold 5. This makes sense tho thanks man for the help.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Honest Player","date":"2018-03-05T22:55:59.090+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also duoing with people with LOWER mmr than you generally has no effect on your mmr.

They are just estimating what it possibly is. Riot is the only one that knows what your MMR is exactly.\n\nIf you are losing more LP than what you gain it's because your MMR is actually lower then where you are, and only consistently winning more is what increases it. And that comes from when the system places you against people who have higher MMR so that it can build yours, but if it's placing you against people that have lower MMR it will take awhile till you have consistently beaten them.\n\nAnd yes, Duoing actually does effect the overall MMR you have.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Marshbouy","date":"2018-03-05T22:54:37.647+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If your MMR is higher than the average for the ELO you are in, you will gain more LP than you lose. \n\nIf your MMR is lower than the average for the ELO you are in, you will lose more LP than you gain.","replies":[]}]}
