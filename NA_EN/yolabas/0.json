And it&#039;s not totally off-meta to have both kalista (bot) and vayne (top) in the same game.\r\n\r\nVayne: https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xS-w5d7Iq-E/V2CamTJ7guI/AAAAAAAAQJo/0Mz3st9hBiwHuBNdq6oO0FkkulDtDHLqQCLcB/s640/vayne.jpg\r\nKalista: http://67.media.tumblr.com/072eb42b549cbf0bd1523b5944ea9239/tumblr_nek3pki7VG1sajfnro2_500.jpg\r\n\r\nThe reason is that in clustered team fights, you really only see the top of people&#039;s heads. This new vayne skin, when she&#039;s facing south/down/the camera/towards the player, has a really (really) tall ponytail, similar to warring kingdoms nidalee and kalista&#039;s baseskin. This high ponytail is not shared in the other vayne skins and so isn&#039;t an immediate visual indicator that the glowing champion with sharp spiny things is vayne. In fact, the high ponytail (-esque thing) with glowy stabby things is kalista, so creating more of a visual difference between the two would be super helpful.\r\n\r\ntl;dr: Vayne, Soulstealer Vayne, please let down your hair!","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-06-22T17:10:06.375+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey yolabas - \n\nThanks for the feedback!

So I hear what you're saying, but that doesn't mean that Riot shouldn't fix it.","replies":[{"poster":"UomoAfide","date":"2016-06-21T14:43:40.832+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"True, it's a sloppy excuse yet considering the rarity of this skin puts it very low from a priority point of view","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2016-06-21T14:53:04.248+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I skipped right past this skin when I first saw it on Surrender@20 because I thought it was Kalista.","replies":[]}]}
