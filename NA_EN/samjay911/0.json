The issue you're having here might be a combination of a few issues:  Old game files not properly installing the new client, and possible security settings preventing you from doing so.  As a first step, I suggest downloading the [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) and performing a clean reinstall.  \n\nOnce complete, go over the [permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) guide to make sure that you can update without issues and allow league as an exception.  Let me know if you have any questions!","replies":[{"poster":"XTitleistYahooX","date":"2017-08-26T10:27:11.446+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have the same exact problem but with \"libcrypto1_1\". This Issue is completely random and has never happened before in all the years I've had this game. The weirdest part is that using your method works but only for one login session; the next time I try to run the game the error reappears.
