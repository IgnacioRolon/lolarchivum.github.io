There's a few things I'll do differently next time, especially regarding that anatomically correct business. :D\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/N9NzT\n\nHope you like.

It takes a fair bit of time to put together and there's a lot of not cheap materials involved. The total cost in man hours and materials is up in the triple digits and I'm not really sure there's too many who'd be into that price range.
