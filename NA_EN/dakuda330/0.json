I've played this game since 2012 and it is currently 2017. I have over 3000 games played. that's a long time to play a single game and a whole lot of games, and so i've seen this company progress for a long time, I've enjoyed this game very much during this time and typically I like the changes to the overall game. I thought the new bushes when they were implemented were pretty good, and I loved the new updated map that we have now, I loved that champs were getting reworks and I loved when they implemented the change in champion costs when new champs came out. But lets get into the complaint now\r\n\r\n     My favorite thing about Riot was, They were very involved in the community. You would often see their comments in posts, The post could've been about how they don't like new changes or the post could've been some sort of fun idea concept that a player would come up with, and they would typically respond, sometimes it would be funny and other times it might not have been something we wanted to hear but at least they gave us something. I don't want to see anymore videos or post saying \"we hear you, and we're listening\" because when they make a change it clearly shows that someone isn't listening to the communities cries for help.\r\n\r\n    When I went through a bunch of posts today on the forum I noticed that when I saw posts from 2 years ago or so there would be upwards of 4 Rioters on one post and not every post was answered but a lot of them were (note: this is only from the new forum that they updated not from the old forum before this one) But when i saw posts from a month ago or 6 months ago, even with 400 upvotes or 200 upvotes, there were no riot comments. I understand that not all posts need a Rioter to comment on them because not all of them are intended for Riot but for the community to see. \r\n\r\n    Whenever I see Rioters responding to critical post its typically an argumentative approach and not their friendly we understand and everything. It seems like how blizzards system has been working for a few years now where its a you're a player and your opinion is wrong and Riot or my opinion itself is right. It feels more like Riot is intentionally ignoring its players cries for help as blizzard has been doing in the past few years even though the company is much younger than blizzard. Its a pretty terrible thing in the eyes of a player that has been supporting this company over the past 5 years.\r\n\r\n   My hopes are that Riot as a company addresses these issues with their current staff soon because if new players come in and see stuff like this Riots dreams of League being on top for a long time is going to come toppling down in the 7 years that this game has been public (not including the beta they had started in 2009). I don't want to see my favorite gaming company turn into something like blizzard after such a short period of time. I would like to see this young company realize its mistake and fix it before its too late and the game dies like World of Warcraft. \r\n\r\n   There are only so many things you can do to attempt so save a dying community before you become so desperate that you become sloppy and release content that the playerbase does not enjoy. I ask that you please take what I've said into consideration, and I ask that you do not make the same mistake that other companies have made because I don't want to see my favorite game die.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Cactopus","date":"2017-12-05T19:34:18.367+0000","up_votes":173,"down_votes":30,"body":"Hey Dakuda330. This might sound hard to believe, but even though we don't always respond, **we actually do read the boards every day.** \n\nThis is sort of taking it off-topic, but I think you're probably right that we don't really engage on the boards as much as we used to. Just to be super real with you, I guess I can share my thoughts about some problems we have with the boards:\n\nFirst, **the boards are really small compared to other English-language League communities.** If you're just looking at these official boards, you might think the League community is tiny. But it's not. It's just that most players ignore the boards. Basically our policy when it comes to engaging with players is to go wherever players go, whether that's Discord, Twitter, Facebook, or whatever other League community pops up. We don't really care about controlling the community or trying to make our official boards the biggest community—we'd rather let players decide where to go and then join them as members there. I personally post on [the League of Legends subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/) a lot. At any given point in time there's at least 30,000 people online simultaneously there. That dwarfs these boards by a lot. \n\nOne other thing I've been thinking about recently is that there are actually fundamental problems with these boards. The biggest is that **there's almost no reason to go here unless you have a complaint about the game.** Since we really do read everything on the boards, players with issues know they can come here and get their complaint seen. This has the unfortunate side effect of turning the boards into a super concentrated echo chamber of salt. \n\nJust as an example, there's a poster in this thread who currently has 9 upvotes for saying \"they turned a once fun game into a pile of dog shit designed to make them money, except now there isn't enough interest to actually make them any money.\" Compare that to the stuff you see on any other more-popular League community (like the subreddit) and it quickly becomes pretty obvious that **this board is dominated by extreme opinions that don't actually reflect the feelings of the broader League community at all.** So, even if we read it, we're not going to give comments or posts like that too much weight. \n\nI'm curious about your opinions on this, OP: do you think we should have Rioters posting in every single thread in the boards? Or does it make sense for us to take our current \"read everything, respond when it's really important\" approach? Obviously I know how I feel about it, but I'd like to see your thoughts now that I've explained our perspective.","replies":[{"poster":"Very Hard Engage","date":"2017-12-05T19:39:04.858+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":142,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot Cactopus,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=4fAcHIyE,comment-id=0006,timestamp=2017-12-05T19:34:18.367+0000)\n>\n> it quickly becomes pretty obvious that **this board is dominated by extreme opinions that don&#x27;t actually reflect the feelings of the broader League community at all.** So, even if we read it, we&#x27;re not going to give comments like that too much weight. \n\n\nand theres the confirmation that riot knows everything already and has no need for us at all. \n\nwhen riot wants our opinions they will give them to us. \n\n\"help us improve, and share your feedback\" (5000 to 1 said they didn't like the latest change) - riot: lets keep it, we invested too much into it already.\n(cough blue essence and leveling cough) ","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Cactopus","date":"2017-12-05T19:46:38.631+0000","up_votes":143,"down_votes":18,"body":"Don't cut the quote in half to remove the context!

This might be a forum about a video game, but your video game is art, and art means something to people because it is a raw expression of self (thought, emotion, everything) that the artist can't show any other way. A game is a special type of art that people can interact with, allowing the player to connect with the vision of the creator, and thus connect with everyone else who has connected with that vision, I have made friends out of enemies after playing against and with them in League. A video game is more than just a game on a screen, it is art that touches peoples hearts and helps it develop in ways the individual never new they could.","replies":[{"poster":"l Communism l","date":"2017-12-06T04:27:17.756+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am going to chip in because he used humour in an instance where something like this should be common sense, and he's a better guy to just laugh it off than state the obvious truth.\n\nLoL isn't the community's game, **it is Riot's game**.

You have not presented evidence to support those claims, instead resorting to deflection and insults whenever anybody questions you about them.","replies":[{"poster":"Teridax68","date":"2017-12-05T21:41:59.539+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Tactrix,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=4fAcHIyE,comment-id=00060000000000000001000000000000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2017-12-05T21:20:32.709+0000)\n>\n> See the truth is you&#x27;re here crying about my evidence because you know it&#x27;s true and I&#x27;m right, as where you can make up all your false hope beliefs all day long and it won&#x27;t make them any more true.\n\nBut that's simply not the case here, Tactrix, and your replies have been both hysterically negative and completely delusional. Invoking \"most of the community\" or \"the Boards\" as somehow corroborating your opinions (what are your opinions anyway?) without mentioning so much as even a handful of evidence does not lend any credence to your point, and simply tries to turn the argument into a popularity contest, a contest you are, by the way, losing severely. At the end of the day, many of us are dissatisfied with the current state of League, frustrated with Riot because of a particular action they took, and so on, but throwing out insults and hyperbole about the game being \"dog shit\" achieves nothing. In fact, it achieves less than nothing, because as shown by Cactopus's posts here, this is exactly the kind of behavior that drives Riot off the Boards. If you want League to change for the better, express yourself in a manner that will actually generate positive change. Otherwise, don't come here at all.\n\nEDIT: I messed up and didn't see this was the point at which comments stopped being nested. Apologies Halcyon, this was intended to be a reply to Tactrix.
