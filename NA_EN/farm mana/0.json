When that happens they usually nerf the early game.\n\nSyndra's actually got a somewhat weak late game for a variety of reasons. I know that's weird to say given what her passive is but if they intended her passive to be something to make her stronger than everyone else in the late game, it ended up being just something to stop her falling behind as the game progressed. Her scaling outside of ult is generally mediocre and due to her CC being attached to her basic abilities, she falls off in utility compared to a lot of mages once teamfights are more crucial. Plus, Banshee's is a counter to her ult as with Veigar, who is similar in being a \"you'd think he'd be best late but actually no\" mage, but less extreme because his AP stacking means he scales quite a bit harder than her.\n\nEDIT: This isn't very relevant to what you said, sorry. But Syndra being quite strong at every point in the game but with a weak late in comparison to some others wasn't the worst power curve in the world. Now that her early is terrible she transitions very poorly to the mid game and naturally falls off in the late game anyway. They turned her from being moderately strong at all points with a focus on the early game to weak at every point, because she needs a strong early to scale at all.","replies":[{"poster":"Vistha Kai","date":"2015-07-19T16:54:11.761+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd argue that having CC on basic ability is a con.\n\nOn the other hand Banshee's only blocks one sphere from her ult.","replies":[{"poster":"Abyssphere","date":"2015-07-19T17:26:56.922+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Vistha Kai,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=uRsou1JZ,comment-id=00000000000100000000,timestamp=2015-07-19T16:54:11.761+0000)\n>\n> I'd argue that having CC on basic ability is a con.\n> \n> On the other hand Banshee's only blocks one sphere from her ult.\n\nCC on a basic ability is generally a boon for her, but it's a boon that is mostly felt in laning and early to mid when you are spending a lot more time solo and trading in general. Once you get to the part where everyone is grouped up you start wishing your stun was on your ultimate because it would have a much higher power budget at that point.

Just because they're the game's primary burst mages doesn't make them identical, not does it make it impossible for both of them to be good at the same time. And I don't see you complaining about Veigar being a literal better version of Syndra right now.","replies":[{"poster":"CatAndBookTails","date":"2015-07-20T12:13:29.689+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"Read all of my previous posts, i am not saying i don't want her to be good, i like her lore and theme, i just think that Veigar and Syndra are far too similiar because of bad old game design    (q poke - w aoe - e conditional cc - r nuclear launch codes)\nI'm saying her kit is \"badly\" designed, that she will either be too weak or too strong with simple number tweaking.\n\nEither one of them has to be stronger then the other, same as morellonomicon and Athene's unholy grail, it's just bad game design.\n(Although i would prefer a full on Veigar rework considering his kit doesn't fit him at all anymore whilst Syndra's kit DOES fit.)","replies":[{"poster":"Vistha Kai","date":"2015-07-20T14:39:16.302+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"And then I wonder why people shun lower ELOs.\n\n> i just think that Veigar and Syndra are far too similiar because of bad old game design (q poke - w aoe - e conditional cc - r nuclear launch codes)\n\nThat applies to 90% of champions released since Alpha.","replies":[{"poster":"CatAndBookTails","date":"2015-07-20T16:04:44.092+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"\"And then I wonder why people shun lower ELOs.\"\n\nOh look, litterally the one thing that makes me want to stop even bothering to try and have a conversation/discussion/whateveritisthatwearehaving with a circlejerking main that thinks it's main is the worst thing since 1931 and should be buffed to pick-ban tier.\n\n\"That applies to 90% of champions released since Alpha.\"\n\nBecause we have sooo many Gnar, Rumble, Anivia, Heimerdinger,Jarvan,Lissandra,Vel'koz,Yorick,Zilean,Zyra etc champion copies walking around.
