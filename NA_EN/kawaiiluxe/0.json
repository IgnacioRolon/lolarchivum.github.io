I thought I got it on sale a while ago, but that doesn't seem to be the case lol. A friend told me that I had to participate in a tournament to get it, but I don't even know what that is XD. I've also heard that you got it as a reward for playing in Season 1 but if I remember correctly I made my account around when Orianna and Vayne came out and I think that was Season 3.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-04-03T20:32:53.715+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"This was a Season 1 reward, so it looks like you've been playing longer than you think!
