I had the same problem with my 980 Ti, same shit, hovering between 100-160 FPS uncapped.\n\nFor shits and giggles I tried my old Radeon 6850, and guess what - 250+ FPS...\n\nBoth Nvidia cards works just fine in all other games, and this seems mainly to be Riot spaghetti problem - is this being looked in to? Might ofcourse be a Nvidia problem, but I don't think so. :P\n\nLastly, had similar results using a 4790k, 32 Gb ram, and same GFXs tried.\n\nEDIT: Oh, and anyone happen to have a solution? Haven't been able to find one, either myself or online. ;)","replies":[{"poster":"Giojun","date":"2017-10-20T16:07:47.726+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Check your Power options.
