Additionally, all disconnections negatively impact everyone in the match, which is why all disconnections are treated equally by the system and why we cannot remove or modify penalties for any reason.\n\nBugsplats are often caused by certain driver or hardware issues, so I urge you to work through our [Bugsplat Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes) to address the most common solutions. Please let me know if those steps caused any change.","replies":[]}]}
