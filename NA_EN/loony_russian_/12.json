I&#039;m a support main (Gold 2). I&#039;m looking to hit plat this season. 90% of the games I am in I play consistently, though at this elo I find it increasingly difficult to influence the game in such a way that can be truly game deciding or can &quot;carry&quot;. Looking for someone who can play exceptionally well at this rank, preferably an adc, and help me climb into plat. This could be a player who was high plat or diamond last season and is now in high gold or low plat. Or someone on an alternate account works just as well. I main Sona, soraka, and braum. My weakest lanes are probably against any thresh that actually has skill. Active hours are from 5pm-9pm Pacific on weekdays, most of the day on Saturdays, and mornings on Sundays. I have curse and would love to use it.
