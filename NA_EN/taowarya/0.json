Banned after two days playing?","subforum":"Player Behavior","up_votes":19,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hello,\r\n\r\n   I&#039;ve only been playing L.O.L for two days made it to level 10 as of today Aug. 5th 2016 in the morning and got an email tonight telling me I was banned. I thought it was some scam or something but tried logging in and sure enough I was banned. I guess you should get some kind of card or something explaining why but I never got one. Has anyone else encountered this before? I don&#039;t know what I did wrong. I know I said &quot;shit&quot; once but other than that I don&#039;t know. I sent in a request to riot to see what happen. But was wondering if any of you have ran into this. I didn&#039;t see any warning&#039;s or anything but after reading some of the boards it can skip all of them. I mean if I did something wrong I would like to know.

We have a few methods currently but one of the problems is that they can be slow, so by the time we find them the damage has already been done.\n\nIt's possible your account got caught up in the ban wave and if so I'm deeply sorry.  The good news though is that we can release the account if you contact Player Support!\n\n\nhttps://support.leagueoflegends.com/home","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-08-06T03:02:58.316+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":1,"body":"https://i.imgflip.com/18imn2.jpg","replies":[]},{"poster":"TaoWarYa","date":"2016-08-06T02:16:51.589+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"WookieeCookie,\n\nThank you for your feedback.
