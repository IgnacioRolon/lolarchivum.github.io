Now, i dont ask the chroma case on 590 as i thought it would be, i only ask for 30% discount on nemsis jax so i can  buy it again. (i have 750 RP now). help anyone?","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-01-14T18:20:22.279+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Levir7,\n\nThat's correct - if you own the Nemesis skin, the chroma pack would be priced at 590 RP. \n\nIf you had refunded the skin, you would need to purchase the skin again in order to pick up the chroma pack as well. Unfortunately, you'll only be able to purchase Nemesis Jax at the current price, and we won't be able to accommodate the discount you had originally purchased the skin at.","replies":[]}]}
