I let my computer update then opened League to play a game. I was able to log on and get through champ select and the loading screen. When we loaded onto the Rift, my computer froze. The game timer said 2 seconds. I couldn't get my comp to do anything so I shut it down with the power button and restarted. Everything booted smoothly and my comp was functional. I went back into League and created a custom game, and the same thing happened. So I'm all \"yo wtf.\" The League icon on my desktop was a blank white piece of paper, so I tried uninstalling and reinstalling the software. I was unable to uninstall and was given an error message telling me that it was unable to find LOL.NA.msi. I searched my comp for it, and it was gone. So I tried reinstalling the game and got an error message saying \"the older version of league of legends cannot be removed.\" I went hunting and found https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202539040-Reinstalling-League-of-Legends and http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=129468&amp;page=2 as guides. I followed the guides and am still getting the same error message when I try to reinstall. All files associated with lol, Riot, and League are gone (as far as I can tell), I've cleared my registries with CCleaner, and I'm still getting the same \"cannot be removed\" message when I try to reinstall. Even creating a new user on my comp and installing on that one doesn't work. Can anyone provide any insight as to what might be happening or any files that I might have missed when deleting things?","replies":[{"poster":"A Frothy Pint","date":"2016-08-11T20:24:26.609+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fixed it! Anyone having the same problems and is running Windows should google \"cannot uninstall program,\" click the first link and run their software. It caught bad registry keys on which CCleaner did not pick up.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-11T18:21:30.828+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you might be have a series of issues as a result of the update.

So I can't run the HRT because it has nothing to inspect, and I can't test if my drivers are working after updating because I can't reinstall the game. The current issue is that I can neither uninstall my previous installation nor can I install a new one.","replies":[]}]}]}
