So what does stacking mean in playing Nasus, is it increasing his health bar, or some kind of increase in damage or AP? what is it? {{champion:75}}","replies":[{"poster":"Riot 10YearSanta","date":"2015-03-06T03:16:48.943+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:75}} 's Q ability, Siphoning Strike, deals a base amount of damage PLUS a bonus amount of damage per use.  You get more bonus damage on his Q every time he kills something (3 damage per unit he kills, but double that for champions, large minions [like Tibbers and Cannon Minions], and large monsters [like the red buff].  So when someone says that Nasus is stacking, or asks how many stacks Nasus has, they are referring to the bonus damage on his Q ability.","replies":[]},{"poster":"kayakninja","date":"2015-03-06T03:31:29.079+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So, the others have explained the ability already, but just as a reference try to have ~100+ at 10 minutes, ~300 at 20 minutes, and try to stay on it through the whole game. Mind you, it's a fine balance between staying in lane to farm and moving around the map doing things. That'll come with practice though.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tsugaga","date":"2015-03-06T01:26:16.083+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Killing minions, monsters, and champions with his Q ability gives him Q stacks, which increase the damage of his Q.
