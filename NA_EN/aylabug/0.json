I wouldnt say it freezes, because the animations are still moving, but it stays like that. I exit out of the game, and when I try to enter back in I get an error message, \r\n\"Unable to connect to the server. Please check your network connection and attempt to reconnect to your game\"\r\nhowever everything else internet related is working just fine? Ive tried exiting the client completely and reconnecting, but nothing seems to work. Last time this happened I had to wait until the game was over completely before starting a new game.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-07T18:10:41.005+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you've got an unstable connection ranging from packet loss to failure getting back to the game server.
