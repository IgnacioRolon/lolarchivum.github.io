They weren't gifted via a friend? \n\nIf content, such as skins, are removed, it's usually due to two situations - \n\n1) If a player participates in Refer-A-Friend fraud to acquire IP or RP, then any champions/skins gifted with this IP or RP are removed.\n\n2) If a player purchases RP and gifts content with it, and subsequently issues a chargeback for the money spent on that RP, we will remove that content.\n\nIf neither of these instances apply to you, please submit a [ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to Player Support so we can investigate the issue further.","replies":[]}]}
