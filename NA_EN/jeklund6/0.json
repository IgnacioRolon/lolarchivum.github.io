I then figured I would  check to see if I had internet, so I went to a web page and it loaded fine. So I figured my league client was bugged, so I closed my game and figured I would restart my client. Well I restarted my client and logged in and there was no reconnect button or screen, only the regular home screen. I don't know if I lost lp from this or the server went down, but I do know it is somewhat annoying and should be looked at.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-25T20:26:18.519+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you couldn't reconnect after that disconnect, it's likely that the game itself crashed entirely and everyone else was kicked as well. No worries, it's pretty rare and when it happens nobody will get any punishments. It's as if the game never happened!","replies":[]}]}
