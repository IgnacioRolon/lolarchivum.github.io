If you were to get rid of 4-man&#039;s, then it could open up much more possibilities. For example, duo&#039;s and 3-man&#039;s can be put together on the same team more often, so solo players could be possibly be matched up more against actual solo players. \r\n\r\nJust a suggestion, I don&#039;t know if this would make the que times worse or better. As of right now however, due to the fact that there are 4-man que&#039;s, it really pushes the fact that there needs to be solo players in order for DynQ to work. Getting rid of 4-man&#039;s can maybe change that.","replies":[{"poster":"MrLlamaWaffle","date":"2016-04-23T19:03:05.119+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nothing about allowing any amount of players to play together makes any sense to begin with in a ranked MM.","replies":[{"poster":"Adolf Hit R","date":"2016-04-24T09:03:08.992+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MrLlamaWaffle,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=PT8sr6dm,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-04-23T19:03:05.119+0000)\n>\n> Nothing about allowing any amount of players to play together makes any sense to begin with in a ranked MM.\n\nDuo queue makes a lot of sense because bot is essentially always played as a duo lane.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Tufio","date":"2016-04-23T22:30:31.510+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Nah.\n\nFor a solo, is not like 3man are \" more acceptable\" than 4.\n\nAnd a duo+trio vs duo+trio with matching roles will be what... like a 2h queue?","replies":[{"poster":"LiveYiOrDieHard","date":"2016-04-23T22:38:48.177+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Tufio,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=PT8sr6dm,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2016-04-23T22:30:31.510+0000)\n>\n> Nah.\n> \n> For a solo, is not like 3man are &quot; more acceptable&quot; than 4.\n\nErr, not quite.
