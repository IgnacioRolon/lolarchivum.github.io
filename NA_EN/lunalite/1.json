I recently received an email from riot games with a link to a survey, i get them often so i proceeded to take it as usual. However, a few questions into the survey, I was asked if I would be interested in an onsite survey on June 7th, 8th, or 9th (pretty sure those were the dates) in Santa Monica CA. I do live close enough to attend, but was unsure of specific details and whether or not the online survey was a full invitation.\r\nI was wondering the status of this survey and if the participants have already been selected. Any information is helpful! Thankyou","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-05T20:26:16.342+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's pretty awesome that you got invited!! I'm thinking the invitation was for one of our Player Labs to get some additional feedback on certain things. Each Lab is different than the last, depending on what they're focusing on in that group, so you should be able to find all the details in the email you received. You should also be able to respond to that email for any specific questions, and make sure the email was actually sent by us by checking the [**email addresses we use**](https://www.riotgames.com/riot-games-security).\n\nAlso, I'm not sure if this is an invitation that will guarantee you a spot in the group or not, but it's still a chance to be picked to go. Just make sure to refer to that email for this group's specific details ^_^!","replies":[]}]}
