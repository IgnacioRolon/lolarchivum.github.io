Many dont like the one click true damage or % of health damage. Buy armor and true damage will make it look like paper. but why dont you buy health? then  good luck countering % of health damage and true damage.\r\n\r\nim also on the road to quit this game. S9 aka Season Riot Shenanigans isnt going to be promising to fix this poor balanced game instead it will fuck up more due to some incompetent people working in the balance. And it hurts me thinking of leaving this game i put a lot of life and effort on it but one day, one hour, sooner or later i will say its time to stop","replies":[]}
