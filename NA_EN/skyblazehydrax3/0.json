She&#039;s far better than her old kit, that&#039;s for sure. But one gripe I have about her kit without regards to balance is her passive. More specifically, that the side on which the Vitals appear is completely random. This can make it unreliable and difficult to play around, for both Fiora and her opponent, especially in the thick of battle. Popped an enemy&#039;s Vital? Now try and keep track and see where the next one shows up while also trying to survive a teamfight and keep track of eight other bodies. Even in laning the unpredictability of her passive can be costly. It requires Fiora waste valuable seconds in a game where split-second reactions are key trying to track where the next Vital shows up, and her threat level rises and drops unpredictably based on where the Vital is. Even for the opponent this is troublesome, because they have to wait and hope the next Vital shows up in a spot they can easily protect.\r\n\r\nRiot has repeatedly said they don&#039;t like luck or RNG in their game (barring crit), and Fiora&#039;s passive currently has it aplenty. So my suggestion is pretty simple; give the Vitals a predetermined pattern, or maybe even pattern**s**, that Fiora players and her opponents can learn and play around. This would give Fiora much more clear highs and lows that can be reacted to much more quickly for both sides.\r\n\r\nYes? No? Maybe?

If you aren't square in the middle of the vital when you AA, its always a miss. I've managed to kill champs and not get my ult to proc as well, presumably because I killed them without hitting them from ANY OF THE FOUR POSSIBLE DIRECTIONS? I'm sorry, but it should be impossible to AA and not hit one of the four when all four are available.\n\n\nAnd on my own note: Fiora vs Fiora matches are awful.

That's the key to beating out a another Fiora in lane, and the mechanic in general is what I think really sets good and okay Fioras apart.\n\nI feel like new Fiora in general can be pretty frustrating to play against just judging from how other people act in lane when I'm playing her (she's all I've been playing lately so I can't really speak from a victim standpoint). Last night I had a Hecarim staying so far away he was out of vision range because they didn't want their vitals poked. They lost a lot of gold and xp because I wasn't pushing lane. Others I've went against ended up feeding me kills because they wanted to farm which let me poke them down enough with my passive to finish them off with an ult, and when Fiora has you ulted and is Ghosting you aren't getting away.\nThe Riposte is also quite handy for the \"counterplay\" champions. I can't imagine what it was like for the Dariuses and such I've played against.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Biff Manly","date":"2015-08-23T04:45:34.582+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"{{champion:133}} would like to have a word with you about random, unreliable passives.","replies":[{"poster":"Ariel the Cruel","date":"2015-08-23T06:09:59.201+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"And AA's.\n(Bugs OP)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"My Waifu Vanilla","date":"2015-08-23T09:47:50.433+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just don't like when I ult someone and can repeatedly auto attack someone and not proc a single passive because the hitboxes are so unforgiving.
