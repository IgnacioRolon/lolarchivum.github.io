Hear me out!\r\n\r\nVeigar's latest lore update says that he was captured, isolated, and tortured. By who? By Mordekaiser. And not the old \"I like my music\" Mordekaiser, either; the new \"I am going to make my own afterlife in which I reign supreme and control both realms\" big bad that has even people like LeBlanc shaking in their boots. THAT Mordekaiser tortured Veigar for his own amusement, intentionally keeping the Yordle alone and isolated. And we've got a good idea what that tends to do to Yordles in the form of Kled.\r\n\r\nAnd yet all in all, how did Veigar come out of it? Well for one he came out of it **alive** and not as mortar for Mordekaiser's kingdom. So y'know, good start. But even if he isn't all there anymore he definitely came out of it better than Kled's own- self-imposed and without being tortured, mind you- isolation. He's not completely insane, and while he puts forth the conscious effort of being a terrible and twisted villain, in reality he ends up doing a lot of good.\r\n\r\nGiven what Veigar has been put through and what his magic is capable of, I have new respect for the \"Master of Evil\" for coming out of it as intact as he did. I'm grateful too- a truly malicious and entirely competent Veigar would probably be one of the biggest immediate threats to all of Runeterra.","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2019-06-19T15:56:24.167+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":0,"body":"What do you mean?\n\nVeigar *IS* truly malicious and entirely competent!","replies":[{"poster":"Hvsao","date":"2019-06-19T19:44:02.134+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In the long run who would win the battle for the title of supreme evil overlord?

Veigar is most definitely filled with some of the most potential as a character, what he has been doing, his state of mind and willpower, I would love a novella for this character or some more stories involving him. if he ever gets a VO update it would be nice to show off his goofyness have double meaning through his horrible past.\n\nalso I dont know why, but while I really want Mordekaiser to win (even though I want Swain just as much to ultimately triumph over all odds), it would be awesome if Veigar becomes a threat that even mordekaiser would recognize, a sorta spanner in the works if you will.\n\nEDIT: perhaps it would be even more tragic if his sub-conscious moral center was purely vestigial, the last remnant of the Viegar that used to be","replies":[{"poster":"SkyblazeHydraX3","date":"2019-06-19T22:02:43.061+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I doubt Mordekaiser will win, if only because of the sheer scale that would involve.
