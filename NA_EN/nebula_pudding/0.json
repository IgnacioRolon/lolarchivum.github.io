I got a capsule, and when I tried to disenchant the champ shard it kept saying it failed. After a few times of trying I went from 3k to 10k Blue Essence. Just thought I'd report this because I much rather not randomly have my account suspended for \"abusing\" a bug. Hope I can keep the BE tho if possible!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-23T01:28:42.034+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"No bug here! There was recently a sale that went live, and it ended up being launching without being announced 2 weeks in advance like usual. Since this happened without notice, it would feel REALLY bad to people who bought a champion at full price when they could have waited a couple days for a discount, so we went ahead and retroactively gave everyone that discount (where it applied) ^_^!","replies":[]}]}
