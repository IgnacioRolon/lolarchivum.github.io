Your new PBE accountâ€™s now unlocked, and you should already have another email from us with the steps to create your account. \n\nThe first dibs part I am wondering if they sent a mass invite out and it was first come first served. If that is the case that might be the reason some of some of are having trouble making an PBE account. That sucks if that's the case though but fingers crossed that they are having issues with everyone signing up at once.","replies":[{"poster":"ScriptBrand","date":"2015-10-30T02:35:00.200+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"no, that's against the law, and if it isn't ill be sure to write my congressman to change it so it is against the law....how rude","replies":[{"poster":"Xonra","date":"2015-10-30T02:44:29.994+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=PENG YILlANG,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=G2fQOEr0,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2015-10-30T02:35:00.200+0000)\n>\n> no, that's against the law, and if it isn't ill be sure to write my congressman to change it so it is against the law....how rude\n\nlmao","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"James and Summer","date":"2015-10-30T02:46:19.768+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have received the same emails, and I suppose the other email was the one that says \"create your PBE account now\" \nI mean, if they are just sending mass invites why would they tell me that I am now approved for pbe access :( \ni hope rito isnt just playin with my feelings {{champion:32}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Xonra","date":"2015-10-30T02:31:58.972+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The link saying you are accepted is automatic, but (for me at least) it took a little longer to officially \"turn on\" the ability to log in to the PBE client wise and forum wise.
