I like reading the champion lore, but it kinda annoys me that a company as big as Riot still has grammar errors in their official lore. Is there a place that I can reach a rioter about the errors I&#039;ve found?\r\nThanks in advance.","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2016-03-02T06:16:35.452+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I suspect the best place would be the [Report a Bug](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report) boards - I think we add those to the bug database so they can be brought to the attention of the right teams.  \n\nHowever, if it's in the older lores, then there's a chance that they'll be lower priority until they are updated.  If it's the newer lore, then definitely submit it.  I'm sure Jaredan will have conniptions if he hears about it too!  ;)\n\n(I'm not on those teams, so I can't look into it directly for you.
