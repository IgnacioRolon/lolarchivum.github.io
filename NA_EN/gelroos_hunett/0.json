It is clearly stated in my client that the suspension will be lifted on June 20th of 2016 at 4:46 PM. That time has passed, yet my account is still suspended and I cannot join any queues. Why is Riot so slow to remove my suspension?","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-06-21T00:12:56.383+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The 4:46PM should be in PDT, not your local time zone (such as if you are in the Midwest or the East Coast).  Its past that now, so your suspension should be lifted at this point.\n\nLet me know if it is still blocking you from accessing your account!","replies":[]}]}
