Nowhere is it stated you need to own all champions to be allowed into an aram custom game. \r\n\r\nhttps://www.dictionary.com/browse/random\r\nThe best definition for league is prolly the second one. Everything in a set has exactly the same chance of being picked.\r\nThat set being the champs i own and want to play. There&#039;s no reason for me to buy anything i don&#039;t care about. somehow this notion started that you NEED every champ in the game. and at a high level i might agree, but fuck this is aram guys.\r\n\r\nIf an account runs only aram champs then so be it. I don&#039;t, and still manage to get a decent lifetime winrate. So why do y&#039;all keep using those accounts as an excuse? you&#039;re the one who wanted to own all the champs. Why do you get a kick out of ruining someone else&#039;s fun just because you ruined your own?\r\nThen again some of you will stalk an account for weeks cuz they were mean to you once.\r\n\r\nTLDR: \r\nthe first All in ARAM doesn&#039;t mean all champions, it means all players.\r\nyou&#039;re the one who had to be competitive and own all champs, don&#039;t come ruining aram for people who actually buy a champ because they want to play it.","replies":[{"poster":"ankoanko19","date":"2019-01-06T14:23:02.629+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"That's like asking ''why were Karthus or Kassadin disabled for urf.''\n\nYes it's aram but winning is still fun.

At the same time, I recognize that some people, such as yourself, do prefer the current system for whatever reason. Just as it wouldn't be fair to you to have to play with all champs, it's not fair to me to have to play with/against curated champs.\n\nWith that said, the problem with those statements is that it directly conflicts with progression everywhere else in League. Having more champs is a good thing in League:  it adds variety to the game. If Riot didn't want you to buy more champs, they wouldn't keep releasing new ones. In ARAM though, buying more champs is often a *bad* thing. If the \"best\" way to enjoy ARAM is to handicap yourself in every other game mode, there's something wrong.\n\nUnlocking all champs in ARAM would improve the game mode, not ruin it.","replies":[]}]}
