I've won 9 out of 31 of my ranked games. I'm not necessarily looking to climb but want to stay in silver at the least. if interested in duo leave username. if you have any tips for winning ranked that would be much appreciated! Btw I usually play support (blitzcrank or nautilis) but i can also play top (nasus or rengar) and i can play mid but not as well (Heimerdinger, twisted fate, chogath).","replies":[{"poster":"Grashnim","date":"2015-07-15T23:08:44.522+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You'll stay silver if you don't play anymore ranked matches.

The fact that you are even playing ranked without runes makes me believe you don't grasp the basics of the game yet either. It's not \"luck\" that is causing you to lose. It's YOU. Every game you play you start off at a disadvantage to nearly everyone you would come up against.","replies":[{"poster":"Take My Life","date":"2015-07-16T00:30:51.740+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I understand that lacking runepages puts me at a disadvantage, but i can save up the insane amount of ip/rp to buy more rune pages (assuming that is what you are referring to).  If you are talking about runes them self then i will go back to my bad luck... The luck that you are saying doesn't exist and is me in ranked games may be true, but in normals i end up with a top lane feeder or flaming jg. which means i cant get any ip! i feel that i do in fact understand the \"basics\" of the game but you may be right for a ll i know. i am not amazing but i am good. Thanks for the constructive criticism and the not of rune page importance.","replies":[]}]}]}
