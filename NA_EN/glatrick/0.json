You have to hold tab, while still holding tab look at the pictures of your teammates to the left ( the far left of your screen, not the far left of the tab screen you just opened) there will be a box there for you to click. As far as the song not changing, that's up to the sona. She can change the song with /toggle but a lot of sonas are just picking one song and running it all game. I like to switch it with the phases personally :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"GummyBearWookiee","date":"2015-03-03T20:40:57.171+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Again...that doesn't work for some of us.
