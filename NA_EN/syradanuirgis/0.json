It is not a bannable offensive to send a lot of messages. I was still playing the game, I was still trying to win it even though it was lost as we had 7 kills, 6 of which were mine from my lane. And the opponents had 18 or something.\n\nA big problem I feel with the report system is that there is no way to tell if the person receiving punishment has been provoked or not. Likewise, knowing that this in itself is not an excuse to throw around \"extremely offensive and inflammatory language\", I, in my mind, perhaps not RIOTSs, tried  hard to stay within the bounds of reasonable language.\n\nGuess I forgot its 2018 and people get offended by literally anything now.","replies":[{"poster":"Periscope","date":"2018-02-21T03:08:03.907+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":">Firstly, an argument always involves more than one person.\n\nRealize that it always takes 1 to stop an argument.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-02-21T03:17:57.060+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Syradanuirgis,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=vGs23N1o,comment-id=0000000000000000,timestamp=2018-02-21T02:24:18.914+0000)\n>\n> &quot;Uncontrolled flaming&quot;, give me a break\n> \n> I&#x27;ve heard worse language being thrown around in a church \n> \n> Uncontrolled would be wishing death upon my teammate and his family, an offense that got you a mere 10 game chat ban just 2 seasons ago.

When you have been warned that any further rule breaking will cost you your account, you have to know that picking fights with your team is incredibly foolish.  You may try to brush this punishment off as Riot being overly harsh, or ridiculously unfair, but the reality is that these logs are considered below the standard of the League community.  Most players do not want to deal with this sort of thing in their matches.  Yes, they have the option of muting you in the current match.  But they also have the option of reporting you and letting Riot make the call on whether it wants to mute you from the game.  Which they did, and the IFS agreed that your behavior was unacceptable.
