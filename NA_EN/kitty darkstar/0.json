They are almost all memorable. The plot is pretty good, the world it sets up is cool. And there are guns and swords, monsters, and badass abilities.\n\nAlso why do people always think its not? Its just American. While anime is a Japanese term it can be applied to many different shows. And personally I dont give a crap if its \"anime\" or not, I like watching it, so what does it matter? Im not talking at you about this, just generalizing.\n\nOh and you can ship just about anyone.","replies":[{"poster":"LichKing234","date":"2016-09-28T03:18:28.988+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well it is anime regardless of what people say cause in japan anime stands for animation and it means every form of animation and regardless of where its from so regardless its anime no matter what :D","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Maximum Morde","date":"2016-09-27T13:13:18.080+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gunchucks.\nhttp://i.imgur.com/EO7AUKu.jpg?noredirect","replies":[{"poster":"MavenSong","date":"2016-09-27T22:23:52.903+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://img04.deviantart.net/d30f/i/2014/079/c/7/eyes_off_the_gunchucks_by_atsusakaneytza-d7b04kb.png","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kitty Darkstar","date":"2016-09-27T13:11:43.819+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"The writing, honestly.","replies":[{"poster":"kile147","date":"2016-09-27T13:54:30.478+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, a lot of people are offput by the animation but the brand of humor in it is too enjoyable to let that bother me.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"WarlordTim","date":"2016-09-27T15:14:14.747+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fair criticism.  The animation, especially early on where most of the gifs on this forum come from, was **really** weak.  It's the attention to detail in fight scenes and the constant overlay of omfsa%%%hatwasfingadorable that the whole show has woven into it that sold me.\n\nBut you're right, that won't make a good show.  What you aren't seeing here is pretty much anything from Volume 3.  Right from the start, the makers of the show planned to use the first three seasons to set up an idea of what the show was, then **_turn it on it's head._**  From here on?  We're excited to see where the show goes, because right now everything's up for grabs.  There's so many directions the writing could go, and the animation quality is [through the roof now](https://twitter.com/RoosterTeeth/status/780428833983868932).\n\nTL;DR This meme is from Volume 1, episode 8 (yes I know that off the top of my head don't judge me) and the show has come a long way since in both writing and animation.","replies":[{"poster":"Drugoth","date":"2016-09-27T23:46:33.857+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hope you won't be upset that I dont plan to watch it even after you explained all that to me xD","replies":[{"poster":"WarlordTim","date":"2016-09-28T03:48:41.467+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh, no worries.
