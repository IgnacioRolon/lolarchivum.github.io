The lockout animation mainly existed for functional reasons.\r\n\r\nAfter they changed the input to vector casting, the lockout animation technically wasn&#039;t functionally necessary because the spell now only required one input instead of two to make it work. So they removed the lockout. Apparently this also made the spell &quot;feel better&quot; at the cost of some game health, since this opened up the possibility for W-&gt;E combos when previously only E-&gt;W was possible.\r\n\r\nI personally don&#039;t understand why the spell couldn&#039;t keep its lockout animation after a completed input. I feel like it&#039;s much healthier for the game and her kit. Other abilities have long lockout animations without &quot;feeling bad&quot;, such as Lux R, Ezreal R, Orianna R, Braum R, etc. The return of W&#039;s lockout animation would encourage Taliyah&#039;s zoning potential more than her burst potential by removing the guaranteed E after a successful W hit, which would open up her kit to be more balanceable.\r\n\r\nTL;DR I think it is completely feasible for Taliyah&#039;s current vector cast W to have a lockout animation post-cast and remain viable, which would make her much easier to balance overall.\r\n\r\nThoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"inplane","date":"2016-09-13T20:02:20.088+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"To be realistic, Lockout was there for a reason. It was the reason why she was so unique and had a kit that allowed offensive and defensive zone control that punished gapclosing-happy players severely.\n\nEver since it was removed, her entire kit fell apart because by the nature of her W and E. Those two skills were balanced around Lockout. E was allowed to heavily burst people regardless of HP and resistances because it was situational. She couldn't perform W into E, so she had to go into a close range. Allowing her to use W into E made the setup too safe and E's damage had to be lowered to almost nothing. Of course, using E into W was affected and there is basically no point in using it anymore, getting rid of {{champion:163}}'s \"Zoning\" aspect. E is usually used as a tacked on DPS skill when W is used first. \n\nBasically, her skill floor and skill ceiling completely fell into the ground because the mechanic that made her so challenging got removed.

Yes, said delay is around 0.25-5 seconds. That might seem small in general, but to a kit like hers, that's a huge added delay.

It felt like you got better at W (you're quicker now) but the game won't let you use that hard-won skill\n* It turns out that we can either have proper spell queueing during a delay or good communication that a spell cannot currently be cast, but not both. This is one of the areas in the game we're working to improve. Either way, the experience was not up to our standards.\n\nIt also turns out that I was wrong to be scared of W into E. Ranges and cooldowns make this combo reasonably balanced. \n\nThe things we're struggling with right now on her kit are her wave clear (which we've hit very hard. It was meant to be a strength, but it was clearly excessive), the difference is usefulness of her ult between coordinated and uncoordinated play (we always knew this was going to be trouble but signed ourselves up for it because the skill is cool), and how much she falls off late game. Her theoretical DPS is absurdly high, but the later the game goes, the more of a premium there is on getting your damage out INSTANTLY, and her Q means she always has to wait a minimum of 2s to get one rotation out. Again, if you do the math? Her late game DPS is off the charts: At 40% CDR, she has a 2.4s CD spell that deals 420 + 1.2 AP. That's just the one spell.  But then you look at actual data and we see there are very few champions in the game who fall off late game quite as hard as she does. \n\nRemember that ours is a game that's never done.

People should've played her more and learn the ins and outs before demanding such a huge change. Her W change was so rushed it's not even funny. Not fine-tuned in the slightest way and visually deceptive for newer players. \n\nPeople who played her pointed out the flaws of Lockout removal such as making her play more like a binary burst mage as we see now. I would've pointed out a plethora of flaws if I knew this change was happening. Flaws such as W doesn't even have a proper targeting reticle. Or it cannot knock up anymore. I didn't even visit these boards in like 3 years until patch 6.14 went live. \n\nAlso, people could've just asked nicely. Instead, they thought bombarding Riot Zenon was a good idea and basically used peer pressure to get what they wanted. That's just screwed up and completely asinine. If I was him I would've completely ignored those people. Most of them probably didn't even play {{champion:163}} (And they probably still don't.).","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Anonagon","date":"2016-09-13T18:39:24.714+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"It doesn't need a lockout. Lockouts on other abilities exist because of cast times and animations, while Taliyah's was purely functional. It is unreasonable to have an ability that is already completely casted prevent you from using your other abilities for a while.

However, I still think E->W SHOULD be strong, since it takes forethought to set up. Hence having a lockout on W.\n\nAs a control mage, Taliyah's strength shouldn't be in her reliable burst, but rather in her zones of potential burst. I think there's no doubt in anyone's mind that E->W takes more skill than W->E, since casting E doesn't guarantee a successful W, but a successful W guarantees hitting E. Unreliability can allow room for the combo to potentially hit harder and make it more threatening as a zone Taliyah can control without making the combo consume so much of her power budget, as it does now. \n\nEdit: Hitting the combo should feel rewarding, so *nerfing* the damage is counterproductive. I'd rather they make the combo unreliable so that they can make the combo hit hard and feel rewarding. Currently, the combo has already been nerfed because its reliability was upped. Taliyah isn't supposed to be a burst mage, so imo she shouldn't have a reliable burst combo. Should she have an incredibly powerful zone that can burst squishies? Absolutely. Should it be reliable? Probably not.\n\nEdit2: Corrected \"nerfing\" (from \"needing\").","replies":[{"poster":"Anonagon","date":"2016-09-13T19:16:14.531+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"I get what you are saying about how unreliability can allow her to potentially hit harder, and I understand why you think E>W is a more skillful combo. However, I think that Taliyah actually does need reliable burst.\n\nThe first thing I want to point out is that, while W>E is far more reliable than E>W was, Taliyah's burst is still nowhere near as reliable as similar champions. If you look at her like a control mage, W is far easier to dodge than something like an Anivia walking up, placing her ult under you, and forcing you to eat a double damage point-and-click E. If you look at her in the vein of a champion like Twisted Fate or Ahri (I think Taliyah is much more similar to these two heavy roamers than she is to a traditonal control mage), W>E is much easier to dodge than point blank Ahri Charms or the targetted Gold Card.\n\nNow that I've established that her burst is nowhere near as reliable as comparable champions, let me elaborate on why Taliyah's burst needs to be strong. With a passive and ultimate that are 100% dedicated to roaming, and only one form of hard CC, Taliyah needs some way to contribute to normal teamfights. Q has minimal AoE and is weak if you aren't consistently moving around, so the W>E combo needs to provide very strong AoE damage.","replies":[{"poster":"B0OM","date":"2016-09-13T19:24:16.217+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"They could always front load E damage into its initial proc. That makes it more potent as an AoE spell since its area is actually rather large.\n\nAlso, the detonation damage only affects the champion that detonates it, so knocking more than one person into the field doesn't increase its AoE damage.\n\nI get what you're saying, but I'm still not convinced that Taliyah should have reliable burst. I definitely think she needs burst in some way, but that can be accomplished in other ways that are more healthy than a guaranteed E after W hit. They could even compensate this change by making the W a tiny bit bigger, but that's an extreme measure imo.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
