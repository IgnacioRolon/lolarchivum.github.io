I have to uninstall and reinstall my client which is annoying.

However, what you are describing to me sounds like the normal behavior of the launcher:\n\nDon't cancel that scanning file. That happens when the launcher is trying to ensure your installation / patching is done correctly, when you cancel it, it needs to do all of it again. Be patient and just let it finish and the game will start.\n\nIf the scanning files gets stuck at a number for a good 10 minutes, then I would be concerned, otherwise what you are describing sounds like normal behavior of the client.","replies":[{"poster":"exiledFromBadmen","date":"2014-10-02T15:24:42.190+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I waited for 1.5 hours for scanning files.
