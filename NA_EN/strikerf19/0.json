I'm constantly changin servers between LAN and NA so I constantly change the lenguage of my LoL in the files but a couple of patches back even if you would change the lenguage in the \"locale\" file the game would not change the lenguage of it, i personaly preffer my game to be in English. I found a way to make it easyer to change after that happended by adding some stuff in an especific file in the 4.11 update or something like that i don't really remember. Now that we got the new client i can't really find the file to change the lenguage in case I change servers. Can anybody help me with that, I would really apreciate it.","replies":[{"poster":"StrikerF19","date":"2016-11-30T22:04:30.392+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Soo im gonna have to play in the old client, cause i really like the Beta Client but i really don't like the spanish version of everthing, I can still understand it but i just don't like it cince i have played the game in english since i started playing.

Hard to say, since I don't work on the team that develops the new client. I'd say it's very unlikely, but again, I'm not sure what that team has planned for languages specifically.","replies":[{"poster":"Hige","date":"2016-11-17T20:18:22.916+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah... I bounce between LAN and NA as well and having to patch twice is a nuissance... not to mention that I also speak Japanese and at times I like my client and voices to be in japanese... I think that giving us the options to use any language we want would be nice or at least give us the option to patch both languages at once :S I know you don't work on this but if you could pass the word around we'd appreciate it!","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
