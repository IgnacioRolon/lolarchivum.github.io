It gave me two free skins as a gift from riot games which I am great full for, but it would not allow me to click anything so I re-logged and this happened and I did not receive my rewards. I am not sure if it is delayed or it just bugged out and I did not get my rewards.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-11-08T23:04:28.070+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The skins should automatically unlock on your account because you completed the mission, regardless of seeing a toast notifications or not.  First Win of The Day recycles, so that's always going to be there.  You'll want to click on View Completed instead, down below.  You should have everything, but let me know if you notice any discrepancy and I'd be happy to clear things up!","replies":[{"poster":"CoolSpeedy","date":"2017-11-09T00:50:41.501+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"~~I received the skins and the rune icon, but I did not receive my 30000 blue essence or the champion of the league emote.\n\nEDIT: Correction, I did receive the emote my bad. About the blue essence it told me I would have over 90k essence available after completing the mission which I did but still I stand at 60k instead.~~\n\nI just realized I had to look in my loot section of the client to receive me essence, I apologize, everything is all good here.","replies":[]}]}]}
