The few tanks that are played are tanks such as Gragas who have game breaking ultimates, absurd innate tankiness, etc. Other than that, I don&#039;t see any bruisers aside from Lee Sin, I don&#039;t see anybody else besides Elise and Kindred, both of which can fight Nidalee in the early game.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Sotere","date":"2016-05-13T20:08:51.836+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":3,"body":"We'll be taking a look at her for 6.11.","replies":[{"poster":"TeemoXNidalee","date":"2016-05-13T20:11:13.487+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":25,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot Sotere,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=h6H0bA7Z,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-05-13T20:08:51.836+0000)\n>\n> We&#x27;ll be taking a look at her for 6.11.\n\nPlease gut jungle nidalee, but bring back spear nidalee that was way more healthy","replies":[{"poster":"lightdragoon88","date":"2016-05-13T20:12:51.952+0000","up_votes":29,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=TeemoXNidalee,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=h6H0bA7Z,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2016-05-13T20:11:13.487+0000)\n>\n> bring back spear nidalee that was way more healthy\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umDr0mPuyQc","replies":[{"poster":"Zyvux","date":"2016-05-14T05:48:15.515+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"This person truly does not know what it means to be one shot by a nid spear the moment you spawn because you decided to pick a squishy champ.

In lower elo, differences in player skill are what determines games because the skill differences are massive there. You can win matchups you have absolutely no business winning in bronze and silver because people really don't know what they're doing. At that point, player skill trumps champion strength pretty much always. High elo, where everyone knows how to play, is where raw champion strength really starts to matter. There's a reason Diamond winrates range from 56% at the top all the way to 40% at the bottom while winrates only range from 55% to 44% in League as a whole: champion strength simply matters more the higher elo you go.\n\nAnd regardless, your opinion on Nidalee is irrelevant.
