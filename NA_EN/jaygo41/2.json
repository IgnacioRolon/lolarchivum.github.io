And so does Riot.\n\nIf there are multiple champions that fulfill the same strategic niche, often times there will be the case where one is simply just better, for one reason or more (better matchups against meta champs, better item meta, kit numbers, etc.). This has happened for years; a really good example of this was late last season, where Graves was picked every time over \"Lose-cian,\" or Xerath was picked every time over Ziggs. Even now, it happens in top lane with Naut and Malph over Maokai.\n\nThis is exactly his point: why pick Xerath, when you have Lux? Yeah, Xerath _might_ do more damage than her at the thing he is specifically supposed to do. That's good. The problem is, that that's _all_ he's got over her. On top of doing almost as much long-range damage, she _also_ has a shield for teammates, a better ult, better zoning potential, she's safer in and out of lane, she has greater catch potential and greater burst potential...Like, on a scale of 1-10, why pick the guy who is all 6s except for one 9 instead of the girl who is nothing but 8.5s.\n\nEven without that argument, it is a fact (according to op.gg) that Lux has the highest win rate mid, and has the highest pick rate.

Your opinion certainly isn't without reason.\n\non paper this all sounds very nice, but in reality the concept of this item only works in abuse cases.\n\nas the one purchasing mejais, you make a decision based on cost effectiveness of the item - nothign else - as its power is based on raw stats. \n\nif the item is not cost effective upon purchase, the only way its not overpowered, youre taking a risk by buying it. if youre already snowballing, that means youre consciously putting yourself behind in gold again and give your opponent, who does buy a more cost efficient item like dcap instead the opportunity to catch up and shut you down, prevent you from further gaining stacks, and making the item worthless.\nin case of most champions this makes majais far inferior to picking up a big ticket item like deathcap instead and keep snowballing on this item. thats why you never really see anyone actually buying the mejais on a regular basis, even when ahead.\n\nif the item is cost effective upon purchase it would automatically be overpowered, as it outshines any other option. you would get the potential of stacking the item further, while not taking a risk by picking it up. youre already ahead in kills and gold, which makes it more likely for you to contiue snowballing on your weaker opponent, than to get shut down. this is the same reason people right now buy deathcrap instead of mejais when snowballing. but if it is just as cost effective upon purchase, the mejais snowballing is even worse.\n\nand then there are those cases like lux, who can play safe enough to reliably stack the item without putting themselves into too much danger. of course this still depends on the performance of your team to some degree. if you cant at least get some assists, the item will still be useless.\n\n\neither way, there was never a way for these snowball items to reach a point of balance. right now, mejais is actually a really shitty item **except** for abuse cases (champions that dont take much risk by picking it up because theyre effective at long range). you can look at how lux snowballs with a mejais and see how the item would turn out if it was halfway decent on anyone else.\n\n\nmejais is an item that creates two extremes, and thats why its never going to be balanced and should better be removed.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Hayaishi2","date":"2016-03-06T04:56:50.516+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":9,"body":"She literally does everything mages excel at.\n\nWave clear?

There are reasons to pick her but there are reasons to pick other mages as well. Just different comps.

Clearly Syndra isnt favoured at the moment. You also forget that Lux has far better poke, and provides a shield for her ENTIRE team. Also Lux's damage is basically entirely AOE with her ult and E and even her Q hits two targets. So while Syndra can burst one target, theres nothing stopping Lux from hitting 2 people with a bind, into her E, into her ult, with maybe even an auto or two for her passive.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Abyssphere","date":"2016-03-06T05:16:38.928+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":7,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Hayaishi2,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=06ZArEIY,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-03-06T04:56:50.516+0000)\n>\n> She literally does everything mages excel at.\n> \n> Wave clear?

Most mages excel at all of those things - the only unique tool she has in terms of mid laners is a shield and that takes up an ability slot that on most mages is more CC and more damage.
