All of this Mundo nonsense has baffled me for the longest time.  Like, why would you pick him over Sion or Sejuani?

The guy can run across half the map and lock everyone down in lane twice with two giant AoE stuns.

Even if you're missing, this means Sion can cover HALF THE MAP every 36 seconds. If you can't hit them with the ulti, you can either R early to get the AoE slow, or go behind them to block off their escape route. His amazing sustain even before cinderhulk means he can pressure lanes far more often than most other junglers.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FirstSergeantBim","date":"2015-03-22T07:34:47.788+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I must be a funny fella because I think Sion has some pretty godlike ganks.  All it takes is a little coordination from your team and he can land his ult, it's not that hard.  Even if he doesn't land it, he can zone the enemy away from safety allowing your team to secure a kill.  This isn't rocket science bro.  Cinderhulk came out a week ago, but he was good before that.
