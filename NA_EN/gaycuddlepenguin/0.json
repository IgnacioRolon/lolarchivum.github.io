We can look into your account and investigate further!","replies":[]},{"poster":"FrankerX","date":"2016-02-06T21:09:32.879+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i lost a skin once, because the person who gifted it to me bought/hacked the account hm","replies":[]},{"poster":"Boulderox","date":"2016-02-06T21:03:04.522+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Check purchase history","replies":[]}]}
