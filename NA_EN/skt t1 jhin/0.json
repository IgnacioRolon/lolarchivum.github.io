I am pretty much think so that there is a bug on ornn ult... after I cast my ult right... there is an extra blue arrow appears( i guess that might be for the redirection thingy)... but the thing is that does not work","replies":[]},{"poster":"GreezerZX","date":"2017-08-24T21:05:01.924+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have the exact same problem. When I was ingame I couldn't hit the ram when he was in range, the rams ingame body would be seperated from the \"ram that does damage\" and sometimes the ram would dissapear underground. After the game I went to test it out with a friend, for him it was normal. I thought it was my internet but after a reseting my internet it still bothers me!","replies":[]},{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2017-08-24T18:02:02.182+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That seems really weird O.o  I don't think I've seen anyone else have a similar type of bug or issue.  Redirecting the ult is a type of skillshot.  You do have to wait until the ram is near you to recast your Ult again to hit it.  When you press the ult a 2nd time, you should see a line missile display, or a small radius indicating how close you need to be in order to hit the ram.  To see this in action, check out our [Champ Spotlight](https://youtu.be/WaJbuSNlVMU?t=194) if you haven't already.\n\nHopefully this helps a bit! if you still aren't able to get it to work, could you record a short video of this happening and share it with us?","replies":[]}]}
