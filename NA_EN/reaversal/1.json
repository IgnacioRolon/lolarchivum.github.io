A range of 2 hexes covers every area on your drawing from point A, and its visually intuitive that the more narrow space is still roughly a unit long.  A range of 2 squares from the middle of a 5x5 grid would miss the corners, making clarity a problem.  Hexes get rid of the diagonal problem of squares and are just visually better for 360 degree movement.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tahminatrix ","date":"2019-08-27T02:22:44.639+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So its off by around 0.5 at angles that are multiples of 30 degrees, a lot more accurate than squares which are completely off (1.0) on all corners.\n\n\nB only needs to be half a hex farther away to be same distance away from A as C and D are...\n\n\nIn a square grid, a top left corner square would be an entire square farther than the other non-corner squares.","replies":[{"poster":"Everyday Legends","date":"2019-08-27T05:29:58.831+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Tahminatrix ,realm=NA,application-id=RaE1aOE7,discussion-id=iguqzA8d,comment-id=0003000000000000,timestamp=2019-08-27T02:22:44.639+0000)\n>\n> So its off by around 0.5 at angles that are multiples of 30 degrees, a lot more accurate than squares which are completely off (1.0) on all corners.\n> \n> \n> B only needs to be half a hex farther away to be same distance away from A as C and D are...\n> \n> \n> In a square grid, a top left corner square would be an entire square farther than the other non-corner squares.\n\nYes, the difference is more pronounced in squares than in hexagons. That's why I used it as an example. It's easier to visualize and understand. The point is, the principle applies with hexagons, as well: the number of units apart and the actual distance between them can mean different things.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Velzard of Koz","date":"2019-08-26T15:54:22.416+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"The reason games like these opt into hexagon grid is literally to avoid the very issue you mentoin.","replies":[{"poster":"Everyday Legends","date":"2019-08-26T22:04:41.087+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Velzard of Koz,realm=EUNE,application-id=RaE1aOE7,discussion-id=iguqzA8d,comment-id=00030001,timestamp=2019-08-26T15:54:22.416+0000)\n>\n> The reason games like these opt into hexagon grid is literally to avoid the very issue you mentoin.\n\nPlease refer to this diagram:\nhttps://imgur.com/a/Y1UTdyc","replies":[{"poster":"Velzard of Koz","date":"2019-08-27T15:03:29.549+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's only relevant If you mix elemental tile system with non-elemental metric system which I don't find any relevant reason to do.

It's more logical and easier to use units as opposed to hexagons, which are measured in units anyway, to calculate unit range changes. But Riot might've lazied out of doing the transformation from units to hexes, when it comes to UI infos, and just took the numbers from the unit code and slapped it onto the info tabs of units. Which might be understandable since the game is still relatively new and there are a lot of fixes to be made later on, following a schedule, whatever that is.\n\nBut, I do agree that, as an information shown to the player, in the UI, where the board is measured in hexes, it should be in number of hexes. That would make it clearer and simpler to read and understandable for every type of player.","replies":[]}]}
