This genteel manner has endeared her to the highborn, though others suspect her spellbinding melodies to actually emanate magic—a Demacian taboo. Silent to outsiders but somehow understood by close companions, Sona plucks her harmonies not only to soothe injured allies, but also to strike down unsuspecting enemies._\n\nShe's an adopted member of a noble Demacian family, right? If she's nobility, then how/why is she ever near injured people to heal them, or near enemies to attack? I don't figure a musician in the nobility should ever really be near any kind of conflict.\n\nThese \"close companions\" it mentions, who exactly are they? Sona's never appeared or even been mentioned in anyone else's lore ever, for the entirety of this game's existence. The closest we've ever gotten is her adoptive family _(but not Sona herself)_ making a brief appearance in Quinn's bio.\n\nThe fact that Sona is STILL this entirely disconnected from the lore after all the recent Demacia lore updates is rather depressing.","replies":[{"poster":"goodiesohhi","date":"2019-08-09T16:19:41.037+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well Sona still exists in the limbo that is the deletion of the League of Legends.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Der Lindwurm","date":"2019-08-08T18:00:46.293+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Eventually, the lore team will realize this whole DEMECIA RLY HATEZZZ TEH MAGICKZZZZ HRGBLRHGLBHGH thing was a huge mistake and makes no sense considering what Demacians in the game actually do (necessary though it may have been to make Sylas and their new story for Lux work) and have to retcon everything again into something more nuanced (for example: Demacians talk a lot of trash about black magic and witchcraft when it's used for subversive purposes, but don't seem to mind magic at all when they're using it to steamroller their enemies, even if that means some collateral damage and civilian casualties).\n\nMaybe they'll have a clearer idea what to do with Sona and it'll be safe to make her more of a part of what's happening in the world then.","replies":[{"poster":"TheMan292","date":"2019-08-08T19:50:38.632+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Der Lindwurm,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=ebdu5ujI,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2019-08-08T18:00:46.293+0000)\n>\n> Eventually, the lore team will realize this whole DEMECIA RLY HATEZZZ TEH MAGICKZZZZ HRGBLRHGLBHGH thing was a huge mistake and makes no sense considering what Demacians in the game actually do (necessary though it may have been to make Sylas and their new story for Lux work) and have to retcon everything again into something more nuanced (for example: Demacians talk a lot of trash about black magic and witchcraft when it's used for subversive purposes, but don't seem to mind magic at all when they're using it to steamroller their enemies, even if that means some collateral damage and civilian casualties).\n> \n> Maybe they'll have a clearer idea what to do with Sona and it'll be safe to make her more of a part of what's happening in the world then.\n\nDemacia is not nearly as horrible to magic as people make it out to be \n\nI know I will get flak for this, but the public perception of Demacia is very much due to exaggerations by the community. seriously, the Demacia is considered worse than Noxus by a loud minority because it does not discriminate against an ability that has caused MANY horrible tragedies","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Reaversal","date":"2019-08-08T06:12:48.327+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"So, after poking around, Sona has made two other small appearances. \n\nShe appears in the Ryze cinematic, helping him fight off some guys.
