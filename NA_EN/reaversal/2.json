Building AS would be trading raw power for fluidity, which you can do on a match by match basis depending on how easily you think you'll be able to land the normal-speed Q's.","replies":[{"poster":"Olath Quortek","date":"2019-08-19T14:41:35.391+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Exactly^\n\nAlso, maybe this is getting too complicated but I like the idea of his chains giving him less AS on the initial hit and then more AS if the pull part of it is successful.
