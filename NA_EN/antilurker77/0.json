I got some message about some RADS error, and was forced to completely restart the client in order to reconnect.\n\nSecond time I was able to reconnect from the client without any error messages. Although when I did get back in the game I had an odd bug where the old and new SR music started playing on top of each other.\n\nIs there anything I can do to fix this?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-10T22:28:52.810+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The issues you're describing, especially the RADS error and old game sounds leads me to believe that you have corrupt or old files in your League installation.
