Those fighters/tanks are meant to be the counter to a melee carry - able to lock down and survive while teammates kill the carry. Why does she *have* to be in top lane? Because that's where she used to be played? Why shouldn't she be played in mid lane like melee carries like Yasuo?","replies":[{"poster":"Decrit","date":"2015-07-21T21:31:58.151+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thing is... are they meant to counter them?\nAs far as i know the job of a tank is to scale in fight duration and close the gap on squishies, aka marksmans, and outlive the burst of assassins to stomp them.\nHowever melee carries are focused on lasting damage, so in a fight between a tank and a melee carry the latter should wreck it up.\n\nI just tested that earlier, i was hecarim against a fiora.

I'm honestly asking. It isn't the amount of time it takes for them to kill you. Melee carries are not focused on lasting damage. Fights against Yi are over brutally quick either way. It isn't how squishy/tanky they are. Both pretty much build full damage. The biggest difference I suppose you could claim is that melee carries more often have to run through the opposing team while assassins can slip in. But that just makes melee carries worse assassins. Maybe it is how many people they can kill? But that is somewhat suspect as well. Fizz doesn't need his ult to kill you. Others like Kata get resets just like Yi. I don't see that much of a difference between 'melee carries' and assassins. Tanks are supposed to be able to lock down anyone trying to get to the carries in the back line - that means assassins and 'melee carries' equally.","replies":[{"poster":"Decrit","date":"2015-07-22T02:01:55.430+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"See, the problem is that there are melee carries that can be built assassins, and rarely vice-versa, so it' s more a matter of skill pattern that actual result.\n\nWhat makes a melee carry to me? Basically what does a marksman, but melee ( this implying the need of mobility/cc/damage mitigation or wathever).\nIf you pick a yi, as you said, fight do not usually last a lot and you are right... but if you see his kit, you actually see that he has a kit for prolonged fights, with effects on hit and attack speed. Yeah he has a nuke too, and that allows an assassin playstyle, but even in the case he still is an hybrid with his ulti and pasisve and e promoting longer fights. Old fiora too, where his burst is double tapping lounge, while compared to a zed or a talon the pattern changes drastically.\n\nIf posed in a duel situation against a tank, a melee carry does the same job as a ranged carry only without the need to stay out of range, killing one of the possible ways the tank could get the upper hand on the carry, and outdamage the tank.\n\nObviously this is idealistic and may vary greatly between character and character.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"AMYS GRAVE","date":"2015-07-21T21:15:04.080+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Why does she have to be in top lane?
