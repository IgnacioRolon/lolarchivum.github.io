Yes, Riven sucked nearly the whole season. She was pure trash from the first preseason patch on. Carry junglers and Tank toplaners really were not her thing and those few carries that were viable (aka Fiora and GP) simply outclassed Riven.\nBut the meta is changing now. Carry toplaners are coming back and Riven started to do fine. Not op, not up, just fine. Sort of viable but definetely not even close to being strong enough for competetive.. But this buff is going to make her actually viable in a way that Riven mains will be performing actually good. Keep in mind that Riven players have in average a 141 games experience with Riven and still \"only\" a <51% winrate. But that's good because Riven is a really popular champion. Every dedicated toplane main tried her atleast once. Most of them had great fun with her. Only some of them manage to find success with her/are dedicated enough to play her despite there being stronger champions. But if Riven is actually viable her playrate is going to explode. \nAnd a high playrate directly equals a high banrate. Playing against Riven is usually perceived as sort of irritating. Playing against Riven in every 4th game is perceived as obnoxious. \nSo please, for the sake of Riven mains, please revert that buff and decrease her movespeed by 1.","replies":[{"poster":"Champion Skin","date":"2016-08-24T09:36:25.714+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"If anyone really needs a buff it would be {{champion:268}} 125+ games still below 50% win rate... though I don't really see him getting buffed because of how good he can be in competitive play...","replies":[]}]}]}
