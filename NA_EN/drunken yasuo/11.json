Your battlefield 4 example shows how poor design leads to poor balance. If skill floor is too high, most players do poorly with the champ/item. If the skill cap is too high, the top .06% of players do too well with it.\n\nSo if you nerf the damage of that item across the board, most players will do worse with the item. Some players who did alright with it will now do poorly. And only the top .06% of players will do well (just not be broken OP anymore).\n\nAnd that's what we see with League, essentially. We have a few different categories to consider:\n\n1) Too Low Skill Floor, Too Low Skill Cap:  These are the champs who do very well in all brackets outside LCS but never see LCS play. Like Heimer, Malzahar, Talon, Blitz, Udyr, etc.\n\n2) Too High Skill Floor, Too Low Skill Cap: These are the champs who are virtually unplayed all around, despite some decent stats from dedicated players. Like Zyra, Poppy, Fiddlesticks, Zilean, etc.\n\n3)  Too Low Skill Floor, Too High Skill Cap:  This is where champs get near-universally good results and turn into holy terrors in the right hands. LIke Fizz, Vayne, Riven, Ahri, etc.\n\n4) Too High Skill Floor, Too High Skill Cap:  These are the champs that do badly in every bracket but get nerfed because of LCS to the point of unviability in most players' hands. LIke Evelynn, Azir, Kalista, Ryze, LeBlanc, Kassadin, etc.\n\nThe problem is that Riot \"balances\" by tweaking numbers far more than by changing actual mechanics. So right now, the skill floor on Annie and Garen, for example, is in the basement because their numbers are so high. Lowering their damage will increase their skill floor and bring them into balance without mechanical changes, but their low skill caps would probably keep them out of LCS.\n\nBut champs like Kalista, reducing her numbers also increases the skill floor on a champ with an already-high floor. So she becomes essentially unviable to a majority of players (not that I mind) to balance her in the LCS where her mechanics would still make her a contested pick.\n\nRight now juggernauts are just overtuned to the point where there skill floor is so low that almost anyone can just go ham all game, lose lane, feed early, and still win. If the lower numbers keep them out of LCS, I'm fine with that. They'll have plenty of company with the 50% of champs that see negligible or zero play who do just fine for the 10M other players.","replies":[{"poster":"Biffolo","date":"2015-09-04T02:00:48.355+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"How is that poor design?

High level play and low level play both suffer when Riot tries to balance for both low level play and high level play. \n\nNow, the deal with which they should choose is: Which one of them is being actively paid to play this game? It sure as hell isn't the Bronze players, or us Unranked players. So, since professionals are being paid to play this game at its highest potential, or at least their highest potential, then the balance of the game should fall on..

But balancing around LCS in the actual game would leave the vast majority of players with an atrocious game experience and a viable champ pool in the shape of an upside-down pyramid.\n\nIn other words, Riot is not going to balance only for LCS because that would leave them with no game to balance.
