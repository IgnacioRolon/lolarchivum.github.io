Just gonna make some logical argument that i hope convince enough people to make this change happen. \r\n\r\nI personally do not share the ideology that toxic chat should be so severely punished because:\r\n\r\nFirst: Getting raged on is the only way players have to tell the guys inting hard, or playing obvious bad picks, etc not to do that specially in ranked.\r\n\r\nSecond: IMO words aren't bullet, this is my view of the world but hey, in america we are literally killing the earth with our convenient/easy lifestyle, it's our cars, trip to Florida and meat consumption the problem. Just try saying that to anybody, they'll just push you out of their lives cause they don't want to hear it. We are lacking a fair dose of honesty and strength of character. So imo there is no moral incentive to overly protect people over strong language, it is not riot's duty to protect from or convert those who disagree with those policies. There is a money incentive though to cater to everyone and banning toxic chat make sens there.\r\n\r\nThird: the game is free... so i'm just gonna make another account, take 5 minutes.\r\n\r\nMy main point is that chat is virtually useless 90% of the time so why not just permaban a rager's chat forever? i will never spend again a single dime on that game if i don't get the account i spent 200$+ on back, i'm not gonna recommend the game since i don't take it very seriously anymore. But i can assure you i wouldn't make another account just to chat, i understand it's your game and do w/e you want with it but to me it doesn't justify those radical choice that have other mean to achieve actually better results.\r\n \r\nLet me be clear that being toxic in chat and grieving in game, like running down mid and suicide on the enemy turret are 2 different thing. Griever should be banned from the game because they are are impacting the game in a bad way. Most rager i encounter still play the game seriously even if they are tilted and rage so really how bad are their words idk.","replies":[{"poster":"GatekeeperTDS","date":"2020-02-10T23:39:19.540+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":2,"body":"> Not gonna hide the fact i'm a rager lol.\n\nAnd nobody else is going to hide the fact that we don't want ragers in our games.

Players would rack up hundreds-thousands of chat restriction games and either continue harassing others with their limited messages or just switch to trolling when they could harass people via chat or both. Some people will just keep misbehaving no matter how many chances you give them, so rather than let them continue playing it's better to permaban them instead.\n\nFrom [Riot Tantram:](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/wsObUaFj-if-tyler1?comment=00010001000000000000) \n\n> It really breaks down into two categories.\n> \n> 1.)

No as gameplay-related offenses are given a 14-day ban first punishment. It's just that it takes longer to punish them due to having to prove intent, which isn't always that simple.

Why is it that i can take toxic chat without a shred of damage to my own self-esteem, as the mature adults need riot's to ban people from saying stuff to them?
