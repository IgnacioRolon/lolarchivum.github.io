Run through the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide, making sure to go over each step to troubleshoot.

However, this doesn't seem to be issue that triggers the bug, or whatever it is. When I join the lobby for a game, I can't see any champions. Additionally, when I go to my champions, and go under the \"owned\" section, I have none. It appears that every champion is locked for me, and I have no idea why! Please help!\n\nThank you","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-30T15:17:37.193+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can still have issues reaching specific services regardless of how good your internet is.  Content appearing as locked or assets not showing up at all suggests a failure to download assets or stay in sync after transitioning from pvp.net to champion select.  Your best bet would be to go through each step of the guide to make sure nothing is degrading your connection during that time.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
