You added SFX to her Passive when she gets a reset, you made the dagger pickup and R SFX better. So why would you just ruin it right as the feedback thread for the skin closes?\r\n\r\nThe skin no longer has any SFX on her resets and R and you can barely hear any sound when she picks up a dagger. And sadly, it doesn&#039;t seem to be a bug as i myself and many others pointed out on the PBE boards that she&#039;s missing her SFX.\r\nWhat kind of dumb decision making is this?

The problem comes up when the games plays the 'Hit\" sound effect.... for every target hit. I can understand why it happens like this. Q is an ability that has a missile speed that goes through targets, so it plays the sound for each new one struck. E on the other hand, while the Sapling Toss and Sapling Chase sounds are fine, the problem arises when it explodes and applies it's effects to targets under the effect of the spell's Brush bonus. It sounds like (at least on my end) that the SFX is just increased in volume relative to the number of targets hit.\n\nWhen I play as Maokai, I can tell when the sounds will happen and can brace myself for the (heavily) increased volumes of Q and E - Brush Explosion. But I've found myself lowering the SFX volume of the whole game when I'm not the Maokai in the game, because I can't pay full attention to the exact moment when the SFX are trigger and I don't feel like having my ears destroyed by basic game actions.\n\nQ has a considerably short Missile Distance and a fast Missile Speed. Is it possible to remove all SFX for targets hit after the first, or reduce the relative volume? And if you find the time, checking the code for Maokai's bonus E effect to make sure it's not doing something screwy on the SFX side?","replies":[{"poster":"semipriceysoap","date":"2017-10-27T21:33:31.777+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Gear Kitty!\n\nI'll have a chat with the appropriate audio folks for this and see if they have any thoughts on what we could do about it!","replies":[{"poster":"Sidodah","date":"2017-10-28T02:14:27.703+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello semipriceysoap!\n\njust a comment here, and this is coming from a S3 Kata main, I for one (as of 7.21 live) think the sounds for the Katarina skin is waaaaay to low. I rely a lot on hearing the sounds and it is screwing me up... I know it is also quit for the opponent, I've played a few games with friends and against them, they all say the same things \"That q is too quiet\" or \"the ult went off? wtf?\" and i personally agree with them. I would just turn up the in-game sounds, but compared to all the other sounds in league I feel like my ears would burst. but all in all, the volume of sound fx is the only problem i have with the skin.","replies":[{"poster":"semipriceysoap","date":"2017-10-28T22:15:29.833+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey hey!

I did tone down some of the R brightness, but the volume overall is coming back up. Chatting with our release team, it may unfortunately not come out until next patch (7.22) to live but should be on PBE now. She was volume balanced against the current base Kat so should be around the same.\n\nThanks for all the constructive feedback!  :)","replies":[{"poster":"Daunt","date":"2017-10-25T16:11:05.607+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm actually testing it in the practice tool right now and it definitely seems better now.

Another chance for Kat to sound more deadly.\nI think that hearing the SFX when she gets a reset is a huge factor in why Kat is fun to play. Especially when it's a bit louder like on her classic skin. And i definitely think that the sound can aid you gameplay wise.\nThis is why i also brought up her PROJECT skin. After the rework the tone of it drastically changed and it's harder to hear it in fights as well. If it's possible could you bring PROJECT : Katarina up in those discussions as well?
