And as a die hard Katarina main it loooks really underwhelming, especially after Riot released so many high quality skins this year. Shame they flopped on Harrowing with these really lacklustered skins.\r\n\r\n_**MODEL:**_\r\n\r\nShe looks kinda weird. I really like the idea of the floating hair but reconsider the hairstyle of it when she&#039;s facing us, the hairpin doesn&#039;t really look good in my opinion. The hair could also not be as bright as it is at the moment so she&#039;s not just some sort of banshee Jinx.\r\n\r\nI dislike that you&#039;re going in the direction of EVERYTHING HAS TO SHINE IN BLUE. Her daggers seem a bit too bright and look weird.\r\n\r\nThe costume is not that bad tbh and i like the use of purple in it.\r\n\r\nWhat flips me off the most is the color palette. I think that toning down the blue and changing the pink to purple or green would do wonders for the skin. Also her face doesn&#039;t look like what Katarina looks like.\r\n\r\n_**VFX AND SFX:**_\r\n\r\nHer passive doesn&#039;t change, i was thinking it would be better if she had the green souls animation like when she picks up a dagger.\r\n\r\nBoth animation and sound for her abilities look and feel clunky. Again, the pink color flips me off again and, in my opinion, i don&#039;t think it should be there.\r\n\r\nBoth her dagger pick up and E have new SFX to them yet when you use E to a dagger it still uses her classic SFX. Not sure if this is a bug.\r\n\r\nThe ultimate is fine, i like that the entire area is filled with animation.\r\n\r\nSo again, the colors are a bit off to me, I hope the pink could be removed for purple or green.\r\n\r\n_**RECALL:**_\r\n\r\nEvery Katarina recall looks amazing and this one didn&#039;t disappoint either. The only issues i have with it is that it uses her classic SFX when the daggers get darker at the beginning of it, looks kinda weird. Also, instead of ascending to the portal she opens she kinda just disappears.","replies":[{"poster":"semipriceysoap","date":"2017-10-12T20:01:08.871+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Daunt, thanks for the feedback! I'm working on cleaning up/tweaking Kat sounds based on these sort of comments so I appreciate the specificity of the notes on what's feeling off - so thank you!","replies":[{"poster":"Daunt","date":"2017-10-13T10:37:24.484+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you so much for taking the time to go through the post.\n\nThere's also one thing that i forgot to mention. I know that you don't specifically work on the VFX department but would it be possible to also tweak her dagger pickup area? The area around the landed dagger looks a little bit weak, giving it more colors or making it darker would fix the issue i think.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ZER0 2","date":"2017-10-12T20:20:18.174+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Please don't get rid of the pink!
