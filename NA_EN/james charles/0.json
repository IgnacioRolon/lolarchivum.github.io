I was told by my friends that they heard if you don't get accepted in about a year or less, Riot has officially rejected your application. Every week I keep checking my e-mail and checking my status on the website and it's always in the \"Pending\" stage. If Riot DID reject my application, would it say? If not, why is it taking so long for me to get accepted? I have only had one chat ban for 10 games and a few LeaverBuster bans. If anyone could answer it would be great, thanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-23T03:19:01.930+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately, simply applying for a PBE application doesn't guarantee an invite. Invites typically go out in batches and the criteria for being chosen will depend on what we're testing at that time. So, if we were looking to test a new tanky support champ, we'd most likely send a batch of invites out to Leona mains. \n\nYou can find out more about the system in our [**PBE FAQ**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751904-Public-Beta-Environment-FAQ#top).
