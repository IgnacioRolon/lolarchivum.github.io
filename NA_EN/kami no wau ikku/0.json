I use darius and I had 270 phy def and yet she was eating away at my hp like it was nothing.","replies":[{"poster":"Mistress Shyvana","date":"2016-07-27T21:37:37.483+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"**On mobile and didn't feel like taking off caps. **\n\nSo here.

She hits like a truck but moves as slow as molasses. \nShe's easy to predict, she has Large indicators of her abilities. She goes to slap you? Sidestep and punish her, her main damage is tentacles. Don't be aggressive towards a illaoi in lane. Freeze lane near your tower so she's vulnerable to ganks. \nShe fucks most top landers but only if you are aggressive leave her to the midlane/adc\n\nCome team fights save some form of cc for her ultimate. Expect her to wipe your entire team if you group up and she gets a five man ult+soul\n\nYou have to play around her and just pay attention to her it's obvious. You grouped up? Here comes ult. She walks up? She's gonna E. If you're squishy and illaoi is close enough to W you..
