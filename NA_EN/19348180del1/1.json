This issue is game-breaking and Support will not know how to deal with it because any and all submitted logs will read as your client and file structure did prior to the most recent set of Windows Updates.\r\n\r\nSymptons/Signs\r\n\r\nLauncher: None.\r\n\r\nClient: None.\r\n\r\nGame: After the client directs the game application to launch, the application will attempt to switch to fullscreen. The screen will go black as it usually does before running the Process. However, the screen never lights back up, game never loads, and if you are somehow able to, closing the application and reopening it will sometimes result in \"No internet connection\" messages popping up (assuming you are in windowed mode). If you are in full screen however, you will never recieve a message because the Game application is docked in Fullscreen mode but hasn't fully loaded in all assets and cannot technically make the client out of Realtime Priority. In windowed you will be able to alt+tab and eventually find a prompt from Command Center to make changes to your computer. Press Yes to allow it. Canceling this will cause your game application to not connect to the client server and thus loop \"No internet Connection\" for the duration of that GAME CLIENT session (not Game Application). \r\n____________________________________________________\r\n\r\nWhat is actually happening is the Command Center application I mentioned earlier is attempting to load as a background process. Due to the Windows Update, the process is requiring Administrative Access and brings a prompt up on your screen which cannot be seen due to the League Game application being stuck in Realtime Priority \"Always on top\" status (if the game is set to load in windowed mode, you will be able to see the prompt come up after about 5 minutes of blank screen).\r\n\r\nIf you somehow manage to click the prompt and confirm to move ahead, you will finally load into the game. YOUR GAME WILL START AT 6 MINUTES AND THE ANNOUNCER WILL SAY \"Welcome to Summoner's Rift\" BUT IN REALITY ALL PLAYERS HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU TO LOAD THE ENTIRE TIME.\r\n____________________________________________________\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\n\r\nUpdate your drivers through the Dell.com website using their Detect Drivers feature. Make sure you install both outdated System Bios drivers. This is what is causing the the game to never launch, and for you to get Leaver Buster remarks and Negativity Reports.\r\n\r\nI hope that you all find this out here. Before this issue gets you into trouble like it did me.\r\n\r\nAre you reading this Riot? I hope so.","replies":[{"poster":"Chermorg","date":"2017-10-16T03:13:35.050+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had this problem!!!
