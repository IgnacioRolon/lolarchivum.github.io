I admit. I was wondering if you can give me a second chance, I mean, I know It&#039;s not a permanent ban and I&#039;m thankful for that, but I really wan&#039;t to play League this week, because in 2 weeks the exams session starts, and I have my free time only for this week. Can you give me a chat restriction instead? I never received one to be honest, well maybe that&#039;s because I was super toxic? I don&#039;t know. I won&#039;t flame anybody ever again. Please review my ban.\r\n\r\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2018-04-30T22:46:09.861+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm afraid that if you jumped straight to a 14-day ban it's because you were likely either *extremely* toxic, or used zero-tolerance language such as hate speech or encouragement to self harm.

It's not a \"time\" thing or a \"we didn't catch it earlier\" thing: it's a \"you REALLY violated the rules, so a small slap on the wrist won't do\" thing.","replies":[{"poster":"stereal","date":"2018-04-30T23:05:37.783+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately I have seen first hand with long time friends of mine that have been in this situation this guy is experiencing, and I have had recorded chat logs of a lot of the incidents of the suspensions.

The multi-step system is built to do exactly what you want, and that it gives players warnings, put some behavior is so egregious that a strict punishment is necessary.\n\nPersonally I agree with this strict punishment in these cases, because I don't think it should take a slap-on-the-wrist to realize that hate speech or encouraging another player to harm themselves are behaviors that are unacceptable in a game.\n\nIn short, I agree with you that a lot of toxicity can be prevented by early warnings, but the system is designed currently does this in all but the worst cases. I don't agree that these egregious cases should be given significantly more leniency than they currently are.","replies":[{"poster":"stereal","date":"2018-04-30T23:48:49.642+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with your post, honestly, I just believe it's more so the fact that because Riot knows that LoL has one of (if not, the most) toxic fanbase of all time, it's not even up for discussion considering the fact that players have to constantly go into games surrounded by an atmosphere of toxicity (especially when losing) all the time, it's almost inevitable to stop a player from acting upon this behaviour at least just once. This game causes players to lose their patience easily if they're not good at self control and when almost everyone in a game is constantly just throwing toxicity at each other, I think words like \"kys\" or \"gg ez\" really are the least to worry about when I hear half the stuff that is in my games sometimes.\n\nIn a lot of games, yes this behaviour should be dealt with immediately, however since LoL is nefariously known as the most toxic community in a video game, and the environment that players are in constantly, can you really blame them? I think there should be a little more leniency towards toxic behaviour with some players. I'm not saying \"Oh this guy told someone to kill themselves we will let it slide\", no! but maybe if they have a good honour rank or something, Riot could think \"hmm well.. he does have rank 4 honour, it could of just been one of those days\" I'm just giving ideas.
