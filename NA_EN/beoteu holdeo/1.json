Sword looks great as does the head/face but it seems the angles/direction are a bit off and the proportions on his torso could probably be better. All that being said infinitely better than anything I can do and I hope you do more! ^_^\n\nI agree with what you said about the angles. Not an artist either but I was also noticing how it seems like the main features of his body are all centered around what appear to be near 90 degree angles. His right arm for instance travels straight outward from shoulder to elbow and pulls forward into a 90 degree angle to where he grasps his sword. The arm position doesn't look nature it appears to be forced considering where the sword comes to appear at in perspective. In order to remedy this I believe his right arm should be angled slightly bawkward so that his elbow would present itself behind the plane of his back and the angle from his elbow should be far less defined that the right angle that is present. The 90 degree angle also presents itself on the left arm as it travels straight outward from shoulder to elbow and then fires at a 90 degree angle downward to his hand that is resting the ground. Again it doesn't appear to be a natural position. \n\nNot to be way knit picky over it because it's better than anything that I can do by any means. Hope to see more in the future.","replies":[{"poster":"Duke Anax","date":"2015-03-24T21:34:38.704+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I thuink the position is natural enough when you consider that he is smashing the ground. Try it out! When I did I ended up in pretty much the same position.\n\nThe only problem is the angle of the sword it doesn't quite fit into the hand. But turning it left by about 30° should fix that.\n\n@CPG Vanity hope you did this drawing properly in layers then it would be an easy fix.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"PerishSoftly","date":"2015-03-24T01:16:38.009+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"7.8/10 \"Too much blood\"\n-IGN\n\n\nHahaha, but seriously, well drawn.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jeddy017","date":"2015-03-23T23:46:39.819+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Man you are going to get a crap ton of practice.\n\nBy the time you get to {{champion:143}} ,your skills would have increased immensely.May I ask if you can post an art collection so we can see your overall growth (and all your quality artwork of course)?\n\nAs for the Aatrox piece,an overall good piece.I like how detailed the sword & wings are.\n\nThe left hand seems like a blob of colors that is attached to the ground.As StrawberryCocoa said,the body is pretty murky.Try adding a little more details & definitions so people can tell what's what.Also I feel the light in his sword could be a little more bright so it can stand out more.\nAs for the environment/background,a bit more work could be pit in overall.Unless that what you were going for or something.I understand the goal is to draw the champ,but if you're drawing backgrounds at least make sure their pretty close in quality.Try adding a few details to the ground.","replies":[{"poster":"Beoteu holdeo","date":"2015-03-23T23:58:42.153+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sure you can, just make sure to post a link to my dA in the collection.\n\nAnd thanks for the critique.","replies":[{"poster":"Jeddy017","date":"2015-03-24T00:03:26.378+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Whoops,looks like I forgot a \"you\".\nSorry,I meant to say can you post a collection.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Anidan","date":"2015-03-23T22:03:34.233+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh wow..
