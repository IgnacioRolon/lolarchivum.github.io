Does anyone else experience this kind of problem?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-13T23:25:30.514+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is that freezing happening when the game is over or when you're alt+tabbing? Freezes like that can happen if your pc is having problems switching between active programs sometimes when they're running in fullscreen mode, so you may need to try turning on \"close client during game\" so not as many backgrounds programs are running. I'd also consider running a quick repair to make sure those files are all still intact just in case!","replies":[{"poster":"C0d3gennN","date":"2017-12-14T06:54:48.332+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, the freeze happens when I close LeagueClient.exe (I log out, close the client, not just ending a game).","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-15T02:12:48.501+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"OH! So you're only seeing those freezes when you're closing out of the client entirely o_O? Weird....I'm wondering if some of those files are hanging up while it's closing due to some kind of missing or damaged files. Try running a quick repair and let me know if that helps at all.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
