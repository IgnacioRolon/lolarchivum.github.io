It has even gotten to the point where I could not even open up the client. So I uninstalled League through the control panel, and then reinstalled it. However, now when I am waiting for it to update, it has finished, I believe 2 rounds of applying patches, and is giving me the \"Something is wrong on our side that is preventing you from patching, error code 03\" or something along those lines. Is there anything that I can do to fix it? Also that was on the new client, I am trying now to do finish patching on the legacy client to see how it goes, I'll update with more information.\r\n\r\nHopefully I don't have to reinstall it again...\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for the help!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-17T17:05:32.376+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"At what percent are you receiving this error?
