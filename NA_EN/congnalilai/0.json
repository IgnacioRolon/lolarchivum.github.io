I decided to stop playing and just end the day by buying some armor pen runes and a quint, just leaving enough to buy Kled when he goes to 6300 IP next week.\n\nI started with 10700 IP and after buying 9 armor pen reds and 1 armor pen quint, my IP went to 2900.... That's not even possible because if I bought 3 armor pen quints and 9 armor pen reds, my IP would be 10700 - (410 times 9) - (1025 times 3) = 3935 IP. So 3K IP just went flying out the window.\n\nI'm really sad because now I can't buy Kled, and yes I tried relogging. If you look at my match history you would see that I played quite a lot this month so I'm sad my IP is gone....","replies":[{"poster":"SeekNDzstroy","date":"2016-08-13T23:07:12.015+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes when I buy a champion, the ip remains the same until I go back into the store. But it seems it took longer for you.

There is a missing piece here that might help clear things up, but shortly before the account also used IP to unlock Nidalee.  I don't see anything out of the ordinary here, or that IP disappearing without a trace.  I hope that helps clear things up!","replies":[{"poster":"congnalilai","date":"2016-08-13T22:15:37.445+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm that's strange. Does that mean my account didn't reflect the IP change for a while? I played several games in between the purchase and my guess is that the IP change wasn't reflected until today.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-13T22:30:40.552+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I've seen cases where balance has a delay in updated, but usually a relog can fix that!","replies":[]}]}]}]}
