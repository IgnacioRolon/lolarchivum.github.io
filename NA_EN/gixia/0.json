Compared to all the other texture rebalances, Evelynn's got quite a bit of work, and it's clear hers is an actual proper TU.  And it looks good!  Definitely a vast improvement.  But it seems to raise a few issues.\r\n\r\nIf I recall correctly, you once said that Evelynn's rig is so bad that she outright *will not* get any new skins until she receives a much needed VU.\r\nAnd if I'm not mistaken, TUs are generally reserved for champions who have old/outdated textures, but whose rig still holds up well.\r\n\r\nWhich leaves me wondering where Evelynn fits in.  I realize that, with the texture rebalances, a LOT of old champions are gonna have to be touched up to fit on new SR, but for all the others it's been mostly just colour tweaking. Doesn't giving Evelynn a more drastic texture update mean all that work is going to go to waste when she gets her inevitable visual update?  Is it that her rig not actually as bad as first assumed? Or is this a sign that her VU is still extremely, extremely far away? :( \r\n(I had been assuming/hoping she'd get it early-mid next year.)","replies":[{"poster":"Ququroon","date":"2014-09-26T01:36:55.237+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Gixia, \n\nI'm no IronStylus, but I can answer this question just as well!\n\nThe Texture Rebalances will not be impacting the work of the Champion Update team. They are being done as bandaids in order to make things look better on SRU, and look more cohesive with each other. These are different from Texture Updates which are more substantial in nature, as well as more long-term solutions to smaller problems. \n\nEvelynn still falls under the Rebalance camp here, even if the work is looking closer to an Update. We know that she needs a large amount of work, ala VU. She's on 'the list', and the Texture Rebalance does not affect her position on 'the list'.\n\nHer rig is still terrible, her visuals still meh at best, but this is hopefully a good bandaid until the time she is (rightfully) updated.","replies":[{"poster":"IronStylus","date":"2014-09-26T07:30:52.624+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":0,"body":"OH CAN YOU?\n\n..oh..

Masquerade Evelynn still needs to be pale. It's part of the appeal of the skin. Changing it to flesh tone distorts the skin entirely.  It doesn't represent what players have purchased prior to this \"band-aid\" TU.\n\nIf the goal was to bring her skin more in line with traditional skin tones; then at the very least she could have been as pale as Jinx.\n\nBut I would rather Masquerade stay ghostly pale.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ququroon","date":"2014-09-27T01:43:45.465+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Any better? :D\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/uoN01rD.png","replies":[{"poster":"Vertexon","date":"2014-09-27T03:25:01.333+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly doesn't look all that different to me.

Believe it or not, all what eve got was a fresh coat of paint a tad more dedicated than the rest perhaps but all in all I'm guessing the work was done pretty fast in comparison.\n\nNow, I think that yeah, these TRs will push most champions back, some more than others. Yes, eve model can be messy, but I think it's nowhere as messy as Taric's, Shaco's and Malphite's, her model has her almost naked so she's anatomically correct whereas Taric's has these old spikes all over the place and would greatly benefit from having more polygons, same for the other 2 who happen to be have distorted anatomy unlike Eve.\n\nI believe though that after Riot takes care of most VUs they'll go through these TRs but for now they NEED to do this first in order for the 120 champions to fit on the new summoner's rift.","replies":[{"poster":"Gixia","date":"2014-09-26T00:47:04.159+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I disagree.
