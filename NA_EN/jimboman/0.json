The game even shows I clicked, but I can barely move, or cast abilities. They're all EXTREMELY delayed, even though I am getting a constant 29 MS and 60-100 FPS. I don't know what is causing this, but I thought I could come here to get some help.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-28T01:26:19.500+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmm that sounds a lot like packet loss tbh. Do me a favor and run a quick traceroute to the NA servers at 104.160.131.1 using something like [WinMTR](http://winmtr.net/winmtr-v0-92-now-available/) and post the results here for me. Packet loss happens between your network and our servers, so there's typically not a lot we can do other than hope your ISP straightens out the issue.","replies":[]},{"poster":"jimboman","date":"2017-11-28T05:33:09.089+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also used command prompt if this one also helps:\n\n1    46 ms     2 ms     1 ms  10.246.79.254\n  2     2 ms     3 ms    10 ms  192.168.50.30\n  3     2 ms     1 ms     1 ms  hezekiah.sbts.edu [10.245.1.10]\n  4    28 ms     2 ms     2 ms  4.14.173.1\n  5     *        *        *     Request timed out.\n  6     *        *        *     Request timed out.\n  7    22 ms    22 ms    22 ms  104.160.131.1","replies":[]},{"poster":"jimboman","date":"2017-11-28T05:25:43.292+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright.
