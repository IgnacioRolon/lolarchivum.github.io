(VENT WARNING)","subforum":"Player Behavior","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ok,\r\n\r\nSo last game I was mid Vel'Koz versus a Zoe. She was objectively better, and Lee Sin kept ganking. Our support (Thresh) was not happy about how I was constantly dying. He soon after started calling me things like garbage, trash, and to \"stop acting autistic\". Now normally I'm not too annoyed by these things as he's just a guy behind a screen and can't hurt me IRL. But the problem there is it was totally uncalled for. It was obvious I was having a bad game. He got mad and proceeded to feed a kill and then disconnect from a still winnable game. I just want to see justice done, but I don't  wanna be THAT guy (AKA BAN HIS ASS NOW RITO PLZ). \r\n\r\nHave you had experiences similar? Feel free to vent here with me. \r\n\r\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"Get Ogre Here","date":"2018-07-25T19:01:15.804+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes it is bannable, Riot considers things like \"Autistic\" and \"Retarded\" as hate speech.

They were just harassing me extremely bad so I did get in contact with Riot and I told them what had happened and all of them got punished.. and honestly I've never experienced that level of toxicity ever like ever it was honestly horrible telling me that I'm trash and crap is one thing but just to start calling me racial slurs and all that crap it's just crossing the line and I'm just not going to stand for it... But saying something is retarded isn't a hate crime at all it's something people have been saying for a while but I guess the snowflakes got to get their fix somehow.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zombie Gerbil","date":"2018-07-25T19:37:59.565+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Anything negative is penalizable.\n**So don't insult.

Any insult ever should have consequence. I went to school with a few people that have autism, many of them don't take insults lightly. Hell, even normal people are affected negatively. Anyone with decent self-esteem will be affected by insults because they start to question their own existence.
