This was my second promotional series as I lost the previous one to Silver. Thus I was granted a free win. However, after finishing my game, the LoL client stated that I had just qualified for my series to Silver and I was back at 0 - 0. I was of course not too concerned, merely shrugging it off as a bug or glitch for the new client. I decided to play another Flex Queue Game to hopefully have LoL update me. I unfortunately lost the next game and in the game end screen received a loss for my promos. Now, I was slightly concerned that this perhaps was a major glitch, or I was just being incredibly stupid. After checking my profile again, I saw that I was now at Bronze 1 84 LP, after losing 16 points. I was now really confused. Wasn't I just in my promos? Should I be in Silver 5? Some assistance would be appreciated.{{item:3070}} ","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-30T17:34:17.712+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not aware of any bugs or glitches, so I took a look at your case to see what's up.  You had a series yesterday where you were 2 wins and 2 losses.  It looks like your last match was a [queue dodge](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751844-Queue-Dodging), which counts as an automatic loss, and ended your series.  It looks like you're back into a series now, so you'll have to win the next 3 games to get promoted.  Let me know if that clears things up, and good luck!","replies":[{"poster":"TerminalTortoise","date":"2016-12-31T09:37:03.782+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the clarification. I do not particularly remember if I dodged queue or not, but if I did, I now understand what has happened. While I did not win my promos, I am sure I will advance soon. Once again, thanks for clearing up the issue.","replies":[]}]}]}
