So I come in this game and we&#039;re 15 minutes in. What happens? Bot lane loses bot turret at 8 minutes, AND is 0-8 by 15 minutes. Jungler is 0-3 complete useless. They shove down mid with rift and get our inhib at 16-17 minutes. So then the bot lane starts running their mouth when I say &quot;jesus bot can u stop.&quot; \n\nEDIT: I ended up carrying this shit bot lane hard af and of course they get a win and get to report me, yet when I report both of them for INTING nothing happens. Your company is trash Riot.\n\nI mean this game is really getting absurd. This liberal company caters to people who intentionally feed ruining the games of others, and instead of making them apologize for ruining their teammates 30 minutes of being stuck in the game, they allow them to report anyone who doesn&#039;t say &quot;GREAT JOB GOING 0-10 KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK SUMMONER!&quot; You teach these kids not to take responsibility for anything just like Obama did. You teach them to act offended, claim the person is racist, and then report instead of taking responsibility. Why is there even a mute function in this game? Grow some thicker skin.

Riot has literally programmed these kids to be complete mindless dolts. Basically what you&#x27;re saying is that I should join these kids and intentionally feed every single game, but just not speak in chat, and then I should report everyone who gets upset about it. Gotcha.\n> \n> EDIT: I highly expected this comment to be from an unranked person. What do ya know? Unranked. You also literally intentionally feed every single one of your games based on your KDAs.\n\nso a couple of things:\n\nyou are right, that is a by the book answer, but Riot does not encourage Inting or brainwash them, nor do I see any riot posts even mentioning the encouragement of inting, you are not required to speak in chat, nor is it right for you to insult someone, you agreed to a term of service set there telling you \"be respectful\" and so does the summoners code \"have fun, but not at anyone's expense\" no one is forcing you to do anything, you don't have to int, you don't have to report people, but sometimes, people don't want %%%%s like you insulting them because they are bad at the game, this is why League is dying, bad players are not encouraged to improve, but discouraged to play the game outright by people like you.\n\nalso, rank dosen't mean shit, it shows your dedication to the game, not skill.\nIntentionally feeding means they **WANT** the enemy to gain gold for the purpose of causing their team to lose, KDA is based on performance, a bad player can have a shit KDA, but they aren't feeding.\n\ncheck your shit before you talk it.","replies":[{"poster":"Negatif","date":"2018-11-05T05:32:11.326+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"breakordoom444","date":"2018-11-05T05:39:16.511+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Everyone here has been trying to give you valid input, and you choose to shame them all.\n\nI hope you get banned.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"rujitra","date":"2018-11-05T04:50:54.608+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Go ahead, see how quickly you get banned for intentionally feeding.\n\nOr you could accept you're wrong here and stop being a jerkbag to others.","replies":[{"poster":"Negatif","date":"2018-11-05T05:01:17.407+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":11,"body":"You don't get banned for \"soft-inting.\" These kids just feed their ass off and don't type in chat and riot rewards them with banning others whose games they ruin.","replies":[{"poster":"rujitra","date":"2018-11-05T05:03:15.778+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"That's because \"soft inting\" is indistinguishable from playing bad.\n\nMaybe these players you're calling \"soft inters\" aren't actually doing it intentionally?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Telephone Booth","date":"2018-11-06T00:07:38.561+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Negatif,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=858H1qyb,comment-id=0001000000000000,timestamp=2018-11-05T05:01:17.407+0000)\n>\n> You don&#x27;t get banned for &quot;soft-inting.&quot; These kids just feed their ass off and don&#x27;t type in chat and riot rewards them with banning others whose games they ruin.\n\nWell... I agreed up until you just had to throw that childish logic in at the end. That sucks. Why cant you just be pragmatic and leave your fucking emotions out of it? Fuck. \"Riot rewards them with banning others\" ... just stop with that child's rhetoric. It hurts the cause. \n\nPeople start to think its just angry butthurt children who think Riots system sucks, because of shit like you are saying.
