He&#039;s purchased the Dragonfist Leesin Chroma pack and they aren&#039;t there for him to select. He&#039;s had the chroma pack since the Lee Sin one came out, and now after this new patch he&#039;s been unable to select it. Is there a quick fix bug to this problem? Is anyone else experiencing it? Thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-08-16T00:52:38.286+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Margorach, \n\nIs this happening every time he does to use this, or was this a one time issue?\n\nWe've seen issues where players aren't able to select chroma packs in Team Builder and are working to resolve it, but haven't had reports of other queues. \n\nAny additional information you have would be super helpful! ^-^","replies":[{"poster":"Margorach","date":"2015-08-16T07:33:57.542+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi, \n\nThank you for the reply. I did have him test it in Normal Draft Pick and it seems that his inability to select the Lee Sin Chroma pack was a one time occurrence. We are currently playing now and he's able to select it without an issue.
