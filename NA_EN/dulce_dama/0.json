(no i wasn&#039;t banned or anything like that at all)\r\n\r\nWhat i mean people are not reporting is that people are choosing to not report someone if they violated a summoners code at least for the most part until it is blatantly obvious. \r\n\r\nThere is some problems as to why people don&#039;t report. One being validity, if someone says report &quot;X&quot; for &quot;Y&quot; (Intentional feeding, toxic behavior, afk, etc) players who could report can not know for sure if a rule was broken. (i know afk should be easy to tell but that&#039;s another thing ill get to in a second).\r\n\r\nNow for the psychological part, some players do know a player did break the rules but choose to not report, why? this is the scenario, one team is winning easily enough to be a stomp and eventually wins, however a player on the losing team decided to afk or misbehave and now its the post game lobby. players from the losing team may ask to report the offender and the team may be upset but for the team that won, they don&#039;t report, they are so happy to win or simply don&#039;t care. You might have some players of the winning team report the offender but likely they wont, most of the time the winners are too happy and leave anyway. Even members of the same losing team may not report, why? because its over for them. (start a new game or don&#039;t want to be in the post lobby) (in no way am i saying this happens every time or nearly so)\r\n\r\nI try to do my part and figure out if a player did truly break a summoners code but its difficult sometimes not knowing what an opposing player said in-game. Now i just want to stop reporting because i know no one does until everyone talks about it in the post game lobby, i even have a screenshot of my report actually coming through with the system telling me it has taken action which is nice but how many will pass by?\r\n\r\nSolution? to be honest its difficult and i don&#039;t know, the point? awareness, i want everyone to remember to report rule breakers but to report wisely. Its difficult yes and we cant control the information that is given to us but we can control ourselves when we know for sure a player did break a rule we need to do whats best.","replies":[{"poster":"Athina","date":"2017-05-21T01:49:54.805+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"1. All a report does is flag a game for review. Multiple reports do not increase the likelihood or speed of review.\n2. Asking for reports is, in itself, reportable behavior. It is harassment and encourages others to do the same.\n\nSimply put, if you believe someone is being toxic or trolling or whatever, just report them yourself. You'll know the game will be reviewed and can leave it at that. If others are asking for reports, don't bother reporting the player in question; you already know they are getting reported, even if they weren't actually doing anything wrong. In fact, you would probably be better off reporting the one asking for it instead.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Aptest","date":"2017-05-22T07:52:14.577+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> ...choosing to not report someone if they violated a summoners code at least for the most part until it is blatantly obvious.\n\nWhy is this a bad decision? I feel that if someone's infraction is not well established, I should not report him. I repeat: why should I report someone, if it is not obvious, to me, that he has broken the code? \n\n>  One being validity, if someone says report \"X\" for \"Y\" (Intentional feeding, toxic behavior, afk, etc) players who could report can not know for sure if a rule was broken.\n\nI have been in enough situations where people flame each other and blame each other for failing and then someone asks the other team for a report. Because of that, I know that there is a very good chance that a request for a report is bullshit. So if a player asks for a report, my immediate response is to consider that person to be a lier, and as consequence also toxic piece of shit. \n\n>  however a player on the losing team decided to afk or misbehave and now its the post game lobby\n\nI don't consider every little thing you do report worthy. People get emotional and lose control a little bit. I'm not going to report them on that as long as it is \"a little bit\". I feel there is merit in leniency. \n\nIf the players on the losing team ask for a report, the infraction has to be obvious. AFKing, **intentionally ** feeding (not \"losing\"), obvious misuse of /all chat, etc. Otherwise, I regard the person who made the request as a toxic piece of shit.\n\n> awareness, i want everyone to remember to report rule breakers\n\nIt is more important to me to report correctly than to report a lot. So that's that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Silent Gravity","date":"2017-05-21T05:04:42.251+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Report the actions you see. Do that part to reduce toxicity. If you're engaging in All Chat with the enemy team as to what another of them said, then you're likely to choose a side, and it's possible for the things you say to slip into harassment. It's very easy to lie in All Chat about what's going on, and one report is all that's needed, so it's best to stay out of it. Report what you see, and maybe say something like, \"I advise you to mute them and report after the game.\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ã¨Girl Nami","date":"2017-05-21T03:58:54.862+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What LuigiTSG said is correct.\n\nAsking for reports is considered a harassment towards your team, and since 1 report doesn't differ from a 9x one\nAsking for reports is ridiculous.
