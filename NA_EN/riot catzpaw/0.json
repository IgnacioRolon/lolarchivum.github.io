I got the game two days ago, I ordered it last week after a friend told me tha game was finally available in italian. Can I say I was expecting some kind of announcement/news? The game just popped up in the store and there was no official news on the NA/EU site, the client OR the boards. I.e., if my friend didn't tell me, I would have never known the game was available in italian (also, this post is on the *american* forum, nothing on the euw boards as far as I can see) :/\n\nI mean, I will definitely pley the heck out of this game and I'm suuuper happy I finally got my hands on it, but why wasn't there any official announcement? The only reason I can come up with is that you didn't want to advertise it too much in order to avoid risking the game to sell out too fast? But eeeeh, it's a meh reason :/\nOr maybe there were plans for an announcement, but something went wrong?\n\nNow, it's gonna be tough to wait till christmas to open it (my wife and I decided to put the game under the christmas tree along the presents for our daughter :))","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Catzpaw","date":"2017-12-02T20:19:19.921+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hi! Definitely understand the sentiment. I think the only explanation I can give at the moment is we were so focused on getting these versions approved and out the door (along with the localized scenario tool), that our publishing effort was neglected in the process. Not a good reason by any means, but this time of year does get a little crazy for us. We'll look to do some sort of promotion for this in the coming weeks. Also, thanks for the heads up regarding the forum! I'll post this in the EU forums as well.","replies":[{"poster":"patmax17","date":"2017-12-02T20:31:35.419+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thank you for making the game and eventually releasing it in italian so I can finally play it (on paper it has everything needed to become my favourite game ever :P)\n\nBut next time please try to not forget to tell your customers that you released a new product xD","replies":[]}]}]}]}
