The problem is that when we print in a new language, we have to hit a minimum threshold to achieve economies of scale - we're able to just barely make the mark on some of those languages. We're still discussing the possibility of language packs (like we did with German), but run into a similar issue for those as well. I will keep you updated on this, but the current outlook points to these being the only production languages for now.","replies":[{"poster":"McPablesas","date":"2017-08-21T15:40:07.559+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm from Spain and I was thinking of buying the game this week.
