Let's see if we can play with the numbers to clarify what you might mean - because think that you might be onto something, though you weren't clear initially.\n\nLet's omit first blood to keep it simple.  We'll also ignore the supports due to their passive on their items and assume that the jungler is not present to clear the wave afterwards.  So that means you get 300g for your first kill on an oppoent.  Then, typically, you lose approximately 1 1/2 waves worth of minions, rounded to the nearest hundred (600g + 300g) - assuming that you are toplane and you took ignite.  So, yes that would add up to about 1200g per kill - now let's factor in a single turret plate which is worth 160g.  \n\nSo, we could be looking at anywhere from 1300 to 1400g as a relative gold difference between two solo laners in the early stages of the game.  (Note that this is not saying that one laner actually has that amount - but it is a relative difference between the two sides.)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Akali Prime","date":"2019-08-08T05:53:44.879+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"every single ranked game i have lost in the passed 2 days has been because one or more of my teammates hard fed the enemy or afked in early game. \n\nplease make ranked based on individual skill.","replies":[{"poster":"Razelth","date":"2019-08-08T20:26:15.847+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Yeah.

You have played 1k ranked games this season in the lowest parts of silver-bronze. An above average skilled player would win a majority of these games and rank up to at least like silver 1 or 2 idk shits a little different this season. And I know how fucking shitty silver is to play in trust me I also hate it. Buuuutttt the reality is there is a lot you can do to win each game or at least most games even when they seem unwinnable. But there a couple problems. You really need to be in a decent mood, if on tilt you going to play worse and it just makes it that much harder to win. You also need to improve and figure out what works for you then you will see the light and rank up until you hit your next skill ceiling. Like for me on the cusp of plat after all these years part of me feels worse than I ever have at the game. Like.... there is just so much I need to improve on to rank higher, but at the same time I am probably more consistent and better at the game now than I ever have been. I can play a bunch of champs in norms an fuck around and do well most games regardless of other players ranks most of the time. And even in all gold games now, which in the past would have been a challenge I find now are not too bad. It's just one of those things. The more you learn the higher you climb and then the more you realize you need to learn and that's how it works. \n\nSilver is really hard to play in because the game is very unorthodox. Trying to play \"properly\" doesn't generally work because the skill levels of people so random. Its more about caring hard and trying to lead your team to victory or stopping enemy team from winning. \n\nAll I know is I used to cry and bitch about my teammates a lot and I couldn't get out of silver. Then I finally improved and got to mid gold where I been chilling but I accepted I wasn't good enough to rank higher and was ok with it. But finally this season I decided to push myself so that's what I have been doing (plus riot changing rank distributions a bit has helped). Anyways, the whole thing is like a snowball effect just like a game of League. The better you get the easier it is to the climb plus the higher you climb where you meet new challenges and learn more which results in having to improve but once you do lower elos get even easier to play through and climb in because you are just that much better than you used to be at the average player. But when you get bogged down by emotions and you stop focusing on improving you get stuck and stay somewhere until you decide to push through and improve.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"FSRER","date":"2019-08-08T10:32:40.935+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If only it was the unfair matchmaking the only problem here.\nMany lanes are unfortunately decided in champion picking phase.
