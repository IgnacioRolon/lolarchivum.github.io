That's 45 and 9 losses each respectively. How is that such a big deal? I don't feel that percent wins within +/- 5% is a useful metric for broken, or terrible. If we use a common site to track win/loss percent across all leagues (let's use op.gg over all ranks over the last month for example), Nunu is 52.34% ranked 13 in win%. Nasus is currently at 50.00% exactly, ranked 64 in win % out of 134 champs. So there are 70 champs below 50% and 63 above 50%. After taking all the win percent, I found the median, mode, mean, and standard deviation of all win % of all champs. The median is 49.92%, the Mode 51.14%, the mean 49.61% and the deviation at +/- 2.32 percent (that's 52.32% and 47.68%). There are currently 13 champs above the standard deviation (starting with Nunu who is 0.02% above) and 21 champs below (starting with Nautilus at 0.21% below). That leaves 100 champs within the standard deviation of the mean (almost 75% of the champion pool). \nEven if you used the 50% bench mark, why Nunu specifically? Ryze sits at 40% (the lowest) and Anivia he highest (54.34%).","replies":[{"poster":"Penns","date":"2017-06-13T15:19:44.416+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because 55% is huge.

And saying it's huge with no reasoning behind it other than \"another 5% more and its 60%\" makes no sense. You could just as easily say \"and another 5% more and it's 65% and 5% more...\" etc... until ultimately you have 100% win rate. I can't even find where Nunu is 55% win rate. Can anyone provide a link to that stat? Is that in a specific tier and over what time frame? If the parameters change, so does the math behind them.\n\nAddressing Garen: If those numbers are true, then that is a low win percent. But what does it mean and why exactly? Personally I think what makes Garen somewhat broken in low elo is that he is simple to use, and opponents are reckless and greedy and mechanics are often not great. In high elo, play mechanics (as I see on pro play videos) play far outside of Garen's base capabilities. I'm not high elo, so this is just my opinion.\n\nI feel that win% far below and above the standard deviation of the mean win% is a useful metric for taking a look at a champ. I don't think it automatically assigns \"broken\" or \"useless\" by itself. \nAlso, since the 55% is a value I can't find, I can't really tell you where Nunu really sits in those statistics. According the the stats I have found, 100 champs are withing 2.32% of the average 49.61%. Nunu is only 0.02% above that. Maybe that's enough to look at him, but I don't feel it really stands out all things considered.","replies":[{"poster":"Sp33d Zer0","date":"2017-06-13T16:24:12.692+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Out of 100 games it's actually a 10 win difference, as you not only win those 5 games, getting 5 games more of lp, but you don't lose the 5 games of LP that you would have lost.","replies":[{"poster":"FreeVolibear","date":"2017-06-13T18:26:38.718+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds like an argument for using Nunu","replies":[{"poster":"Sp33d Zer0","date":"2017-06-13T19:29:02.025+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because it is.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Penns","date":"2017-06-13T15:45:40.570+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its huge because what champ has ever had 55% win rate and was balanced?\n5 out of 100 doesnt sound like much but it is, 55% win rate in ranked as non-smurf is also really good. \n\n\nIts 55% as jungler according to http://kr.lolalytics.com/champion/Nunu/Jungle/  http://lolalytics.com/champion/Nunu/Jungle/  or https://euw.op.gg/champion/nunu/statistics/jungle . \nOf course if you also count Nunu top/support players its gonna be lower.\n\nBut thats not my point, my point is that 55% win rate is big af. \nLook at which champs even come close to that right now.
