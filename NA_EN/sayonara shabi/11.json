There are 5 adcs with higher pickrates than Ezreal and they all have vastly higher winrates than he does; pointing to his pickrate to justify his terrible winrate is nonsense when apparently every other adc isn't bound by that logic.\n\nThankfully, we don't even need to have this argument because we know how well the best Ezreals are doing, which is what really matters. The very best Ezreals are [winning 50.62% of the time](http://lolalytics.com/champion/Ezreal/ADC/), which is absolutely abysmal. That's the worst out of all 20 adcs that this site collects data for.

Neither is Lucian for that matter, but that's another post for another time. As for Ezreal, he's about as specialist of an adc as they come; he's all about the poke and slipperiness but pays in the form of vastly below par dps for an adc, especially considering how he builds. His power curve is also extremely specialized, being weak both early and late while dominating at the 2-3 item point.\n\n Frankly, there aren't many adcs that really qualify as generalists, with Caitlyn being the only adc that really comes close. But Ezreal isn't much of a generalist even when compared to other adcs: he has clearly defined strengths, very glaring weaknesses, and a very wonky powercurve. In no sense of the word is Ezreal a generalist no matter how you choose to define the term. There are many, many times where Ezreal is an objectively bad adc to pick, and given how weak he is right now, that's basically most of the time. Not only is he weak against the meta champs in his own role, but meta champs in other roles don't synergize with his playstyle and his items are also on the weak side. There's literally no reason to pick him atm other than for fun or because you simply can't play any other adc; that's the hallmark of a weak champ right there.","replies":[{"poster":"SirLapse","date":"2017-06-08T18:25:08.513+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=DunkinNoobs,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=521oAEsG,comment-id=0006000000050000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2017-06-08T02:01:10.950+0000)\n>\n> I&#x27;m gonna stop you right there because your entire basis is faulty. Ezreal is not a generalist, nor is he good at everything. Neither is Lucian for that matter, but that&#x27;s another post for another time.\n\nWhat the hell? Even Riot themselves has noted Lucian as a generalist. Ezreal was king of generalists before Lucian came back into the meta, and that means Ezreal had an entire season practically to be the best generalist. Koreans loved using him all of last season and especially the beginning of the assassin meta this season. You have not been noting any historical evidence of what you're saying and you want to tell me that Ezreal is not a generalist? Think about what an ADC's most important priority is. It's doing consistent damage and NOT DYING. \n\nWhen your champion has a dash on it, has consistent hard to punish damage through poke, and more importantly a global ultimate that allows your presence to fall off less when you're not in range of an objective or teamfight (with the possibility of using it as an execute), HOW IS IT NOT A GENERALIST? Caitlyn can poke early, Varus can poke early, Miss Fortune can poke early, hell even Twitch can poke early via W>E. But none of those champions use that as a consistent measure for DPS by mid game, Ezreal however does.\n\nOn the side for Lucian, he also has a dash, high sustained damage in closer range scenarios where most ADCs would be punished, and more importantly has an ultimate that has huge execute potential when used properly.\n\nCompare this to Caitlyn for example who has the clear advantage of high range but exchanges it for low attack speed. She will do TERRIBLY against close range assassins and such unless the enemy hits a trap. That condition cannot always be fulfilled, therefore if the meta has more assassins, she will not do as well as she is doing right now. Generalists in comparison never have a bad time unless Riot nerfs them into the ground like they did to Lucian, and they are rewarded the most if their Core items are buffed since they win the numbers war through consistency.\n\n>  Frankly, there aren&#x27;t many adcs that really qualify as generalists, with Caitlyn being the only adc that really comes close.\n\nWith my above point, I've essentially proved to myself that you have no idea what entails a generalist ADC, you only know what is a dominant ADC and a not so dominant ADC, which anyone and their mother who doesn't even play the game can make conclusions of after seeing a couple statistics. You've confused \"generalist\" as \"the strongest available no matter what\" rather than stuff like Lee Sin who are \"never bad\" unless nerfed into the floor (or the respective items the champ uses have been nerfed). The only weakness Ezreal has is based on Tear usage and if the Ezreal is bad, he will likely not have it done by 20 minutes into the game. There have been many of these Ezreals and it skews his power curve more than what you're currently imagining.\n\nIn exchange, there are other ADCs that actually prioritize damage over safety and they are rewarded the most in this meta. Naturally a generalist like Ezreal doesn't use that as a primary strength, so he will not be as good.\n\nI think you need to re-assess what a generalist is and not be going full-on stereotyping based on conclusions that are reflective of the meta and not the champion itself.","replies":[{"poster":"DunkinNoobs","date":"2017-06-09T02:09:06.471+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm sad to tell you, but Riot doesn't seem to know what generalist means either since they've also called Graves jungle a generalist. I don't know what on earth their definition of a generalist means because it most certainly does not mean \"is good at a bunch of different things without excelling at anything in particular\". That's what most people mean when they call a champion a generalist and neither Lucian nor Ezreal qualify. I've already told you why Ezreal is not a generalist, so I guess it's time for a Lucian post.\n\nAll Lucian does is lots of burst damage at short range while being mobile. Outside of his ult, he has the shortest effective range in the game and he also has 0 team utility. His reliance on burst damage over DPS makes him susceptible to tank stacking and gives him a distinct \"win early and mid before you fall off late\" power curve. In terms of playstyle, Lucian is easily among the most binary in his class during the laning phase. Due to his short range, his entire game is to dash into range of the enemy, do his combo, and then run away and hope that was enough to win the trade. When he wins those trades, Lucian is good. When he doesn't, he's terrible. Lucian is good in teamfights when the enemy has to come to him and bad in teamfights against teams that outrange him or have lots of AOE. Due to his short range, his siege is also among the worst for adcs, making his team significantly weaker against split pushing. Just like Ezreal, he has a very distinct profile of strengths and weaknesses and there are objectively right and wrong times to pick Lucian. \n\nThe only adc who doesn't fit that profile to some degree is rework Caitlyn who is strong to average at all stages of the game, has enough utility to be useful in nearly any situation, has enough range to not be countered by range on the enemy team, has a decent mix of dps and burst to make her a threat to all kinds of enemies, and has enough inherent safety to be safe against divers and assassins provided her teams.

That&#x27;s what most people mean when they call a champion a generalist and neither Lucian nor Ezreal qualify. I&#x27;ve already told you why Ezreal is not a generalist, so I guess it&#x27;s time for a Lucian post.\n\nSo if you can't even agree on what Riot believes is a generalist, then I'll point it out to you that they've consistently noted that there is NOTHING setting apart a generalist from other specialized champions other than simply numbers. Highest numbers available? Generalist will perform well. Low or mediocre numbers? Champion underperforms. Holds true with Ezreal and Lucian respectively considering how Blade of the Ruined King moved up Lucian from his garbage state last season. That in mind, Ezreal and Lucian are perfect fits for generalists since they give nothing up for what their weaknesses are supposedly. Lucian in particular has high burst to compensate for low range as an ADC, and it's garbage if he doesn't have the numbers to compete with people. This is unlike Corki because your builds are glass cannon and have no flexibility for items such as Black Cleaver, Guardian Angel, etc. He does not have high flexibility on defense options like Lucian and Ezreal do and this has held true throughout the game's history.\n\n>  Just like Ezreal, he has a very distinct profile of strengths and weaknesses and there are objectively right and wrong times to pick Lucian. \n\nNot correct. Another ADC has to be directly contesting him for it to be that way. We've conveniently had them but it's *extremely* noticeable if a generalist is succeeding at the game. They have higher pick rates and higher rates of success without needing to know literally everything about the champion. Graves was especially reflective of this trend with his farming style and high accessibility to tankiness, burst, and defensive itemization. All traits that a generalist utilizes. The defensive itemization/inherent stats especially say \"you are punished less for picking this champion at any given time, whether first pick or last pick.\"\n> \n> The only adc who doesn&#x27;t fit that profile to some degree is rework Caitlyn who is strong to average at all stages of the game, has enough utility to be useful in nearly any situation, has enough range to not be countered by range on the enemy team, has a decent mix of dps and burst to make her a threat to all kinds of enemies, and has enough inherent safety to be safe against divers and assassins provided her teams.

Her mid game power spike is easily contested by things like Lucian and Draven. Infinity Edge got a cost reduction, a lot of supports in the game that are popular boost her effectiveness, and stuff like Jhin, Ashe, etc. who beat her are simply not popular right now. This is significant to her place in the meta. We've seen this for things like Ahri utterly outdone by stuff like pre-nerf Viktor, Leblanc, and Syndra who are either weak or need immense skill to contest her compared to before.

You have to be able to close out the game before you get outscaled or understand where he might try to cheese you from stealth and make sure he doesn't snowball.\n\nHe's pretty easy to shut out with a bully support when played right, let alone if your jungler comes to shut him down even further.\n\nI don't recognize Twitch ult as OP, it actually used to be much better. It's crucial to his identity as a late game hyper carry.\n\nIf anything could even be considered too strong it would probably be his stealth/camouflage. It's the same story with Evelynn, not being seen in solo queue where most people aren't fully thinking or considering where you could be is a massive advantage.\n\nDon't like saying it like this but it's one of the few cases where the counterplay is quite literally \"get good\"","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
