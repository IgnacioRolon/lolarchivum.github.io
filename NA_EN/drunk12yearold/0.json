You can participate in a debate without telling people to uninstall the game.\n\nThe trinket upgrade isn't for me and it isn't for my team... because guess what... if you are silver/gold level and thinking your team is actually going to use their minimap, you're gonna have a bad time.\n\nWhy bother upgrading my trinket when teammates don't look at the minimap anyway? It's a waste of gold. Maybe at plat level and higher it might be more crucial... but low Elo 90% of people are constant tunnel vision mode anyway.

Warding threatens to reveal the scary awaiting ambush. It literally is a subconscious fear of imminent failure that prevents players from warding to avoid failure. Those who ward are the ones who have the will and fortitude to win, and are confident in their ability to deal with the enemy. That is why warding happens more often in higher tiers.","replies":[{"poster":"Rando McGee","date":"2015-05-29T16:47:23.299+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dunno why you got downvoted, this is a good and funny post of you ask me.
