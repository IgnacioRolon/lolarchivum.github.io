Since it is not his account he flamed everyone like there&#039;s no tomorrow and got my account banned for 14 days. Then he told me, &#039;hey I borrowed your account and sorry but I got you banned. Oops.&#039; \nNow I have a 14 day ban and he&#039;s back playing in his own account. I can&#039;t change my password because I have no access to the email I used to register anymore and changing passwords require a valid code from that email address. When the ban ends he&#039;l just take my account to boost his friend again and continue being toxic. I sincerely hope that both of them gets a ban for toxicity, even if they are my firends.\n\nSorry for my crappy English, English isn&#039;t my first language.","replies":[{"poster":"SnakDatSmilesBak","date":"2017-04-01T15:37:07.259+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm pretty sure account sharing is against the rules so be careful bro.
