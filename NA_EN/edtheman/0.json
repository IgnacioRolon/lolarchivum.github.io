Ok, so this point is pretty obvious, up votes and down vote. \"Circle jerk content\" making it to the top, while the obscure and thought provoking content that isen't \"meta\" won't surface. Sure, I enjoy Reddit casually, but when it comes to the league forums I want find what's going on today, new skin idea, new streamers, new build theory, who accomplished what today and see if i can accomplish that too. I want to see the \"scum\" and really like to take a new light instead of just shrugging it off like it's spam when it's a really nice addition to the community i think.\n2. Why do we have to merge over from gd? If you don't like our threads at gd, or our \"shit posters\" why FORCE them to this place? Seems like counter culture to what riot is saying. If this place was so good with all the daily users why try to bloat it with these type of threads?\n3.  Lets be honest, these forums are better for posting, embedding, quoting, even summoner icons. Cool, if i didn't already have F.E.K on gd. Why not just integrate this into gd and allow both forums lay to be on par with each other?  Personally I feel the color is terrible, the way it's organized is dysfunctional. I can hardly read what's what, everything seems to blend into the background.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"HurriKane","date":"2014-10-08T00:12:35.721+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Currently we are locking all discussion about board feedback.\n\nIn the last 24 hours we have had hundreds of threads to communicate issues about the boards, due to this we are requesting you post all comments to this mega thread - http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/site-feedback/lLiAKid9-boards-feedback-mega-discussion\n\nPlease go ahead and post your constructive comments over on that discussion.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Iron Angel 2003","date":"2014-10-07T06:04:56.680+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"Its better than the cesspool that was old GD, aka 4chan 2.0.
