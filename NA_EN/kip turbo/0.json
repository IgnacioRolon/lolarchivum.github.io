I think its an awesome idea. What about you guys?\n\nEDIT: So this seems to be a pretty popular request for the XP Bar behind your name to be something more than an XP Bar. Ranked Players and Normal's Players both like the idea of having this serve a different purpose. The options are still open for consideration, but we think there should be an option in the client for multiple choices to cater to the likes of everyone.","replies":[{"poster":"Uiru","date":"2015-01-25T19:38:48.608+0000","up_votes":30,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't understand why nobody seems to be replying to anything anymore.\n\n But yeah, that would be neat.

An LP bar, a bar that fills as you get closer to your next daily win being available, one that keeps track of how many champions you own out of the maximum, anything.
