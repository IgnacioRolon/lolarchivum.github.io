I would like to start by saying how awful the LatAm community is, i think it&#039;s by far the worst one of all the ones i&#039;ve played on, there&#039;s at least one or two trolls/afk&#039;s every one or two games (literally) and nice people just doesn&#039;t exist.\n\nEverybody just hates each other, everybody dislikes each other&#039;s posts and counter argue themselves for no reason at all, the only reason being wanting to humilliate you as a player.\n\nPeople have their minds so closed to new things and insult the fck out of anyone in their way. Most of the Community is EXTREMELY racist (Chileans, Argentinians, Peruvians, all treat each other like sht.) Every now and then comes out a guy saying: Come on, we are all just as ugly :V. And everyone calms down...and then they start insulting each other again.\n\nIt&#039;s insane how EVERY, SINGLE GAME, there&#039;s at least one Chilean or Argentinian insulting each other.\n\nMy point is, i&#039;d like a lot more to belong to another region like NA, problem is, i don&#039;t live in NA. NA has a lot more...humor and are very open-minded about everything, is what i like about it, when i played with this account on NA everybody was super nice here (I mean compared to LAS.)\n\nThanks for reading!","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-01-29T16:27:30.314+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As long as you don't have an unplayably large ping I am sure you are fine playing on NA.
