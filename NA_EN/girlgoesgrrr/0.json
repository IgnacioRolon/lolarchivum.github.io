Whether you work a full time job,  stay at home parent, or you're simply a student. We as individuals and as a community on this beloved game have come so far. (10 years to be exact!) I myself started this game in October of 2010 and have seen my fair share of toxicity, unsportsmanlike behavior, trolls, intentional feeders...etc... You get it. Most of the time I am always a team player and try to bring out the positivity in my team, and there are also some times where I let people get the best of me and I argue with them. (Don't we all?)\n\nI think there should be more of a way to EARN rewards and allow you to send feedback on someone who made the game special. (Whether they be on your team or the enemy team.) There are times when someone on the opposite team was just an awesome person and I wish there was an option to \"Honor\" them. Now, I know that there is already an honor system. But what about a honor system that's some-what identical to the reporting system? You're able to \"report\" and leave a small message, Check off sportsmanlike behavior, over-all kindness, and great team spirit. You log into the game to see a message that says \"Hey, thanks for being an awesome member of Leagues community, here's an EXP boost for 10 matches. That'd make you feel great, right? Really would make you want to try to not lash out irrationally on your teammates or the enemy team. Might make people think twice before calling someone \"trash\". Instead of bringing each other down, how about we lift each-other up?","replies":[{"poster":"SirWimder","date":"2020-01-08T23:30:11.164+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Their use to be...\n\nBack before the new system you could honor anyone, not just 1 person...your whole team / enemy team.  They use to give rewards for it as well.\n\nBut then riot sold out. and its all changed.  At the end of the season their was rewards based off honor and ranked. but now we have swapped from being a game focused on playing as 5...to a game that has you climbing solo q as a requirement to get a spot on a pro team....\n\nSportsmanship has been something that is lost on the internet....for the simple fact that if someone call you a slew of words you can't just simply  face check them with your first to let them know you wont stand for that....you just have to mute and move on...then report and hope the bot does something about it. \n\n\nI tried for a year to make a clan based around this ideal....and only ever got 3 members....but those 3 members I now call family and we have played toghter for almost 6 years.","replies":[{"poster":"GirlGoesGrrr","date":"2020-01-09T00:25:37.026+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I know, I remember that system. It is just quite sad what the honor system has become. Really nothing special to be honest.","replies":[{"poster":"Imperial Pandaa","date":"2020-01-09T22:15:51.478+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That is a matter of opinion. While you may disagree, only being able to honor one person makes that singular honor mean more. In the old system you could honor willy nilly, which deflates the meaning behind the honor.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightsky Pirate","date":"2020-01-10T22:21:20.520+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you are trying to invalidate the opinion. To be blunt, your opinion is only better informed, but no better, because the facts about the honor rewards changes nothing. The facts are obscure estimations and objective based in design anyway. You should have linked that if you were trying to be helpful, but no, it's pretty clear you're just putting down dissenting opinions.","replies":[{"poster":"Imperial Pandaa","date":"2020-01-11T03:22:33.695+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No? I have an opposing opinion, so it will typically sound that way no matter what. I could take what you said and say it back to you right now and how silly would that be?\n\nIf you look on nearly any \"Bring back enemy honor\" post that I happened to have commented on. You will see my normal response is \n\n>Sure, but it shouldn't actually carry any benefit. You can be informed x enemies honored you, but doesn't contribute to honor progress.\n\nIn this case, I replied to one of OPs replies (unsure if you are in chrono view or discussion. So saying for clarity) that view don't feel lile the new honor system is sad compared to the old. That the new is nothing special.\n\nTo which my opinion is that the new system has more meaning behind honor since it can only be given to a single person and not Oprah style. \"You get an honor and you get a honor! Everyone gets an honor!\"\n\nIt is a forum. Believe it or not I can disagree with someone and still respect their opinion. Just because I don't agree with them, doesn't mean I'll put them down. Only time I really do that is when they insist on shoving words into my mouth.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightsky Pirate","date":"2020-01-11T03:46:56.290+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aye, that's cool then. Just *seemed* like it was that way, while the quoted response doesn't. I understand the honor system's usefulness, and even applaud that it is being used as such- in the big picture. Still, I rather agree with the OP. It is relatively unrewarding and effortless to acquire, making it worthless from the player PoV. There is no real incentive to enriching the game for others outside of the immediate benefits. OP was proposing something to incentivize it. Which just makes sense... from the player.\n\n(edit: though some who don't earn it so easily seem to value it)\n\nSo, yeah, I got bristly when it seemed like a knockdown. Thank you for the clarification of intent.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"CharDeeMcDenniz","date":"2020-01-09T00:08:55.160+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SirXerath,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=krnp04mE,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2020-01-08T23:30:11.164+0000)\n>\n> I tried for a year to make a clan based around this ideal....\n\nwhich ideal is that exactly?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TIKrunk","date":"2020-01-09T21:09:54.506+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That sounds like a pretty cool idea.
