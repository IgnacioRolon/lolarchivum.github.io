Brand has 1 useful support ability, a single cc, meanwhile Sona has heals, shields, auto empowerment, a stun and a slow, a micro-exhaust, and a movespeed buff. Also Her Q is arguably one of the best poking abilities in the game with auto targeting and then an auto to deal rather _noice_ amounts of damage with little to no AP, and then scaling extremely well throughout the rest of the match. If you hadn't guessed, she's my favourite Support. Admittedly, she can be pretty easy to play, which frankly I like. It's less stressful. Like the opposite of playing Kalista or Draven. She's just so versatile, engaging disengaging poking sustaining, the only thing she cant do is push lanes quickly. Ok, and play against Fizz, nobody can do that. Like seriously though. What's with that Fizz E. Zhonyas+Mobility on a cooldown 80% smaller(may not be accurate) like what even is that. You couldn't get that much safety and reliablity if your Barrier was on a 4 second cooldown.","replies":[]}]}
