I've been theorycrafting a top-lane Q-based build/playstyle, but that seems to be the only possible option for him now.  He gets destroyed by pretty much anyone in mid, and his waveclear (which was always his strongest aspect) is now heavily nerfed until you Augment his Death Ray.  \n\nThe problem is that anyone is able to avoid most of his burst by just walking away.  The damage nerf on the initial laser and the delay on Aftershock's explosion, combined with Chaos Storm's full 2 seconds between damage procs make it incredibly difficult to win fights 1v1.  I understand that Riot wants him (and other mages) to be more teamfight-oriented, but this is not the way to do it.  Early game most of your time is spent trying to farm (now much harder) and fight alone against your opponent in mid.  You'll be completely unable to win trades unless your opponent massively misplays, but any other champion can do that too, and probably more efficiently.  \n\nAs a Viktor main since I started playing this game around the start of Season 3, that last part kills me to admit.","replies":[{"poster":"FiddlesOnTheRoof","date":"2016-05-06T15:38:59.559+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Weird.

I think that if they were introduced on their own (without accompanying sweeping and unnecessary champion changes) that they could have had a positive impact on mid-lane. Obviously, there are some problems with those changes on Live now but there are so many confounding factors involved because of the champion change dump.\n\nBut then you have changes like Viktor, Cassiopeia, Anivia etc. that dramatically impact playing those champions in ways that current players of those champions aren't going to like, that don't seem to have been made with any input with those communities that already have invested interest in those champions. That's the change that's bad, it's made en-masse and without a meaningful dialogue between the developers who want to update the game and the community that's already invested in playing the game as-is. There's no compromise, and \"getting used\" to changes made that way isn't a great way to spend your leisure time.","replies":[{"poster":"SeaWyrm","date":"2016-05-08T08:37:39.343+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"See, but I play a lot of Anivia myself, and I think despite the backlash I've seen on her changes, they might just improve her overall. I can't speak for the other champs that got controversial reworks, since I don't really play them, but for the one I do know, it seems to me that a significant portion of the backlash is more \"Ugh! Change!\" than anything else. \n\nAnd as far as communication goes, I think people tend to assume their opinions are more common than they actually are. I think this creates the illusion that Riot pays less attention to the player base than they actually do, since we'll all tend to think that whatever parts of the change we don't like, nobody else likes either. We'll all tend to think Riot isn't listening, whether they are or not.\n\nBut they might not be listening anyway. The game design folks who make these decisions are subject to the same effect, after all, and might assume their vision of a champion is more common than it actually is. I think some clearer, more public dialogue on some of this stuff wouldn't hurt. \n\nStill, even that wouldn't necessarily help as much as it might seem like it should. Getting good feedback is hard. Sorting out what's just a vocal minority is hard. Making changes that everyone will like is, generally, hard. A lot of the stuff that seems like an obvious bad idea after the fact isn't likely to be so clear beforehand, even among the players who really care about a given champion, and regardless of whether it even is a bad idea or if it just seems like it is. Maybe Riot should try harder - either to get feedback from the player base or just to make it clearer to everyone that they're doing it - but it's a tough battle either way.\n\nReally, I just think that the course of wisdom is to reserve judgement, keep an open mind, and try to get past the initial knee-jerk against change before settling on an opinion. (And then maybe ultimately realize that the changes we originally disliked don't suck after all; they REALLY, REALLY suck.
