I didn't think you could get any more dumb. Not exactly a woman thing? Maybe you should do your research. Ever hear of ronda rousey? Search her up and look what she wears and tell me that isn't realistic. People like you live a sad life because you feel the need to ruin everything for everyone with your views on how woman should look, act, or be portrayed in a fantasy fucking game. Please go hide in your world where woman are covered head to toe in burqas.","replies":[{"poster":"IcyPepper","date":"2015-09-06T04:55:21.324+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Please go hide in your world where woman are covered head to toe in burqas.\n\nOkay, I don't think we're on the same page.\n\nI'm just hoping we eventually get a Boxing Vi skin like on the original post.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Ceridran","date":"2015-09-06T17:23:21.250+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"IcyPepper","date":"2015-09-06T20:07:21.557+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't worry, it was just a joke.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Daedalus871","date":"2015-09-05T14:58:53.190+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Something something Vi's base skin is already know for being a \"boxer\", so not in the foreseeable future.
