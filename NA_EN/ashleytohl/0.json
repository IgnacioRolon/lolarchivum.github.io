Someone told me 3. I've completed 3 today and now I have a new mission to get a certain amount of gold. So do you get a set number in one day and then more the next day? I have looked and looked for answers to my questions. Either I'm missing it and missing some screws in my head or it's just not there.\r\n\r\nWhat happens if you failed a mission. Do you get another chance the next day?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-17T01:34:51.591+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You start with the mission \"In the beginning.....\" which when completing will give you the icon Order and Chaos icons. After that quest is completed, you will have 2 daily missions each day. If you have extra missions, It could be the Force of Wills mission which is kind of an event long mission. You might have also purchased an Order/Chaos Pass which opens up two 1-time missions line for each pass.\n\nIf you fail or don't complete one of the daily missions, it will expire and you'll only be left with the mission for the next day.","replies":[{"poster":"ANT1HERO","date":"2017-06-17T11:29:45.928+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi i'm at day two and no new missions yet,what time does the server update this sorry if its a stupid question.","replies":[]}]}]}
