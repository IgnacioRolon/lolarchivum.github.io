The error doesn't occur until I get into the game load-in screen. My computer goes blue and it tells me this game is no longer supported. Prior to the 7.1 patch I had never this error happen on my desktop ever. Is there something I can download that can fix this? Or will I have to wait until this is addressed in a further patch?","replies":[{"poster":"A God Dam Retard","date":"2017-01-12T17:01:38.048+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You are not the only one. I've racked my brain over this and have tried everything within my moderate knowledge of computers to fix this. Opening the config file and manually setting the resolution does not resolve this issue. It's a major defect they let get by and you are the first person I've seen have this issue as well. This means it isn't isolated","replies":[{"poster":"A good spanking","date":"2017-01-12T18:17:53.972+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you, I appreciate you commenting because I have lost my rank due to this bug. I had played a ranked game after the 7.1 patch dropped and I got marked as leaver buster due to being AFK in a rank. I'm not that tilted that I lost my rank I just want to play the game and I know how long it takes to come out with a new patch. At first I thought this was a problem with my computer or the files for league. So I completely re-installed league as well as a system file cleanse.","replies":[{"poster":"peter geter","date":"2017-01-20T05:19:13.400+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think its the video cards on the computers cant handle it.

You should be able to quickly work around this by hitting the **ALT+ENTER** keys simultaneously once you leave champ select and start loading in the match. This will toggle you into a Windowed Mode and resolve the issue, but keep in mind that if you re-enable a Fullscreen mode, it will cause the issue again.\n\nI can't provide an ETA on when this issue will be fixed for good, but we're looking into it. Let me know if you have any questions!","replies":[{"poster":"noobgod101","date":"2017-05-23T01:12:20.872+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been having the same problem for the last week.  I'm not sure what caused it.  I have a decent graphics card that I installed several months ago, and have been playing great.  Well, I was stuck in Gold V for a long time, but that's another story.  All of a sudden, I can't play.  After the loading screen, it just goes all black, except the words \"Unsupported Mode\".  I can hear the music in the background.  Yes, I can work around using alt-enter, but that doesn't work very well.  My resolution is all messed up under Windowed Mode.  Was this caused by patch 7.10?  Please advise.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Vazner","date":"2017-01-22T16:34:04.724+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i cannot believe this is still not fixed went to see if it was fixed cuz it looked like there was an small update for it today and there was no bug notification on the problem anymore but of course its still not fixed pls riot fix this problem i have to much money supporting your company and enjoying ur game through the years to have to deal with this crap","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vazner","date":"2017-01-17T02:31:17.039+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well here i thought it was just me n my tv, I hope this is fixed soon, I have been playing league for a very long time and would hate  to not be able to play it anymore due to this issue.","replies":[]},{"poster":"A God Dam Retard","date":"2017-01-12T18:26:41.541+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have a trouble ticket submitted with all supporting evidence.
