It looks amazing, and I know the standpoint of Riot is mainly that \"we want players with us every step of the way\". I LOVE that outlook, but the basis is concerning. I think that the release of the new map was... premature ? I read on the PBE discussions about the new ambient sounds etc. and honestly got disheartened. Every Teaser/Trailer/Sneak Peek released has said \"in the coming months\" and to be honest i feel like im getting the \"kickstarter game in beta\" deal, where developers tell you \"oh its coming\" but yet you sit and wait for the full package until you forget about the advancement because honestly its taken so long youve given up on it. \r\n\r\nI LOVE league, and ill play on the old summoners rift everyday because its what i know and love. However I feel that the map is one of those things that'll happen \"one day\". \r\n\r\nThere are so many elements, bells and whistles missing from the new map, that i feel it's going to take a LOT longer than any of us expect it to. \r\n\r\nI love the fact that we got involved with the new map with the ability to see it and have feedback, but i also feel like im getting stood up on a date.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot JxE","date":"2014-07-12T14:42:55.326+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know it's tough and trust me we want to get it out to you guys as soon as possible, but releasing this early was the only way to get feedback that we can address. If we waited any longer it would just become a beta/bug fixing test. Now we can actually listen to everyone's feedback and address their concerns. It'll be worth it in the end :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Iciclewind","date":"2014-07-12T06:53:31.027+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Meanwhile Ao Shin cries in a corner...","replies":[{"poster":"Blackquill","date":"2014-07-12T11:06:06.190+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"What is better?
