Like hecarim deals alot of damage with only ar and mr. Nautilus amd amumu do this also. Also if I jungle with yi or xin game recommends attck speed upgrade on my machete instead of ad. Do they scale with it?","replies":[{"poster":"Zen Ineth","date":"2017-01-24T00:42:47.422+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It all depends, really. Once you play for a while, you start to get the hang of it. \n\nNautilus and Amumu have generally high base damages to offset the lack of scaling they're going to have with their 0 AP items, generally. Amumu also has %Max HP damage on his W, which can end up being strong against other tanks. Yi and Xin scale well with Attack Speed mainly due to how their kits work; Both are on-hit reliant champions that have benefits for high attack speed. Yi has his double strike, and Xin has his heal. \n\nGenerally, once you've built your core item, you tend to look at what enemies you're against and what they're building. Say, for instance, I'm playing Vi jungle. If, during champ select, I see that they've got a team of mostly squishies, I'll pick Fervor and max E second. If they've got a team of tanks, I'll go Colossus and max W second, and build two damage items. \n\nBut yes, the more experience you have, the more you'll know how things \"should\" go.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-01-24T00:40:49.916+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Xin has a heal that applies every three hits, incentivising him to take attack speed, also it lets him proc his knock up faster. Yi has a similar passive that works every four hits I think? Also, the jungle item that gives attack speed also has an on hit effect which synergizes with their own speed boosting skills.\n\nCharacters that are meant to be built tanky have low scalings, meaning that offensive stats won't help them much. To offset this they have high base statistics that, while they will never reach what an offensive character can do, make them enough of a threat to prioritize when they are the safest target for squishy characters like adc's.","replies":[]},{"poster":"StoryDuck","date":"2017-01-24T00:40:18.493+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Builds for champions tend to be more fluid then a fix set of items purchased x, y, z in that order.  There are optimal builds for damage or tankiness for many champion but those are just dream scenarios.  you need to take the flow of the game and who is ahead or behind into consideration when you get items.  \n\nFor example: If you are ahead in game with a couple kill under your belt getting some extra damage on hecarim or amumu can be very impactful but if you fall behind getting more tanky stats will help you survive long enough to contribute to your team.  \n\nAnother Example:  If the enemy AP mid laner is winning lane getting MR first would be great, if then enemy ADC is ahead get some armor quick. \n\nThere are a lot of other situation that will affect what you want to get for items so try not to get into the mind set that there is one build path for all situations.  If you are having trouble I would take the NPC suggested purchases, Offensive options if you are ahead, Defensive otions if you are behind.  At least until you have a better understand of what items fit what situations.","replies":[]},{"poster":"videorfeak","date":"2017-01-24T00:39:07.681+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Decide whether you want to focus damage or tank, then look at what damage/tank items synergize with your kit. After you have done this and have a basic idea of what items are good potential items to build then worry about counterbuilding.\n\nEx: oh hey their team has 4 ppl with ad and a tank so skip the mr items and build extra armor.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MrHaZeYo","date":"2017-01-24T00:35:51.165+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Everything is situational. \n\nYi can basically build anything and be successful lol.\n\nHec builds Tri Force into straight tank, I mean if your massively ahead a Ghostblade is good on him.","replies":[]},{"poster":"astrea106","date":"2017-01-24T03:01:42.738+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the help guys","replies":[]}]}
