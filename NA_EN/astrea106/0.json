My go to role is jungle I love ganking and killing adcs. But some games end really bad and I can&#039;t tell if I could&#039;ve done something different. One of my most recent games every lane was pinging for help and feeding. \r\n \r\n So I had a few questions before I entered rank soon. What should I do in this situation? Is there mismatch champions even though both can play that lane? What to do about a teammate who&#039;s 0/10. Is Thunderlord good on melee since it scales higher with ad? \r\n\r\n Also I watch challenger streamers already. Any guides or players in particular?","replies":[{"poster":"astrea106","date":"2017-01-15T04:49:22.151+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the responses will just wait till ranked","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-01-15T03:49:38.067+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You are lv27, You cant expect anyone to know what they are doing for a while yet, just carry on.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dreadlocks","date":"2017-01-15T03:44:48.334+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Play tanks :) Cause its what low elo tends to lack, and its def the game changer role <3 gl fam","replies":[]}]}
