League has one of the worst disciplinary systems I have ever seen in any online game. The tribunal is a joke and punishes players for substantially nothing. Banning players that respond to toxicity with a simple &quot;Fuck off&quot; instead of punishing the players who tell others to kill their selves. I was a huge supporter of this game for many years. I&#039;ve been playing for 6 years, I streamed league with friends, I recruited a bunch of people to the game, and have spent thousands of dollars on the game over the years. I even created a club at my school where players would come to gather and enjoy the game.  However despite all of this support and money and time I have invested with League, I am in the middle of champion select when I get the notification that I have been perma banned. Bam just like that. I submit a ticket asking to simply speak to someone about this decision but nope. I can&#039;t even get that. Just the typical robotic &quot;under no circumstances&quot; bullshit. I would like to thank you Riot for finally giving me the wake up call I needed to stop playing your over rated garbage. Thank you for ensuring I never give you another dime. Thank you for ensuring I never fool anyone into thinking this is actually a quality game. Thank you for ensuring that I never waste another 40 minutes of my life. Call me what you like, but I will no longer show blind loyalty and support to a game that ultimately treats its players like garbage and I hope some of you do the same. There are many games out there that offer the exact same thing as LoL without the toxicity and bullshit that you find in League of Legends.","replies":[{"poster":"Shadow Savage","date":"2016-02-04T00:04:31.103+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"What were the circumstances of your ban?","replies":[{"poster":"Slurpee Slayer","date":"2016-02-05T01:40:36.768+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"That's the thing, they did not tell me the circumstances. All the they said was we do not appreciate toxic behavior in the community. But when you read the chat logs, the other individuals  are the ones flaming and instigating arguments. But because they have put so much blind power in everyone's hands with this bogus report system,  all that has to happen is a couple trolls or just bitter players report you for ultimately nothing and your banned. It's just a numbers game, if enough people report you no matter what the reason you will eventually get banned. Seeing how I have had my account for such a long time eventually the numbers got there and I look like the bad guy. If these people actually did their jobs and read the logs and actually looked who was the cause of the problem, I would of never gotten banned. This game has left a sour taste in my mouth, just trying to get rid of it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Wade Funk","date":"2016-02-03T23:34:56.608+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Good for you, but I doubt Riot cares. That's the great thing about being such a large company, you can make all of the mistakes and shitty decisions you want but you're still making bank.\n\nLyte has made this game a joke. His behavioral systems do nothing but aid trolls and toxic players by punishing those whom they provoke and in turn making them toxic as well. He is a hack and his \"degree\" is as good as a piece of toilet paper.","replies":[{"poster":"Slurpee Slayer","date":"2016-02-05T01:51:42.553+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're completely right. It's the sad truth. Riot has gotten so massive and corporate it's lost sight of whats important. They don't want to put the effort in to actually dig out the really toxic players that bait everyone else into being toxic. That would take to much work. Instead like I stated above, they will just ban based on numbers. \"Oh look this player has received 100 reports over the last 2 years. We wont read the reports, or the logs because that would take work. Lets just ban him.\"","replies":[]}]}]}
