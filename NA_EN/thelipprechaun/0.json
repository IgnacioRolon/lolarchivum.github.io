I am able to open the legacy and the new client but at the login screen it gives me the Connection error popup that says I&#039;m unable to reach the PvP server. I am curious what kinds of things I can do in order to fix my issue? I have a working internet that should be able to support the game and I don&#039;t see anything wrong on the side of League. I also tried redownloading the game and it did not fix the issue. I am also on Mac if that helps.
