In general I'm stuck on a black screen. Other times I will get an error like \"You've been disconnected from the game,\" or something to that effect that force closes the game, or it will load up the loading screen with no champion portraits and quietly freezes in the background, never loading into the game.\r\n\r\nWhile I sometimes have ping spikes due to wifi interference, they don't last the 5 minutes it would take for me to be unable to load into the game at all. Any help?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-08T22:42:00.895+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"After champion select ends the client needs to bridge another connection to the actual game server you'll be playing on. If it can't make that new connection, you get stuck on those black screens.\n\nLet's adjust a couple of your network settings following a few of the steps in this [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues). Make sure you do the two points about Port Forwarding and DNS configuration, but if those don't help go ahead and do the other steps as well.","replies":[{"poster":"Dying Tempest","date":"2017-10-11T02:05:08.389+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I've fiddled with some settings after getting leaver bustered again for this same issue... hopefully this will be the end.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-11T02:49:21.996+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You mentioned 'fiddling' with some of those settings and I just wanted to step back in to clarify, your best bet is to go through each of those steps one by one for the best chance at fixing it.

I haven't had this problem in two days. Unfortunately I can't tell you what exactly fixed it because in my frustration I did a bunch of things at once, but here is what I did differently:\n\n- flushed DNS\n- turned off A LOT of start up programs\n- uninstalled a lot of programs that were still running despite not being allowed to run on startup (dropbox, onedrive, etc)\n\nI don't know which exactly fixed it, but I haven't had this same issue in two days, so.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dying Tempest","date":"2017-10-13T04:01:30.736+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry, I only mentioned this because I only did the DNS config and port forwarding.\n\nHowever, the problem still remains and I am leaverbustered yet again.\n\nI don't know if it helps, but this only occurs the first game I attempt to play after I start my computer. It doesn't matter how long it's been running, it's always the first game. I can try the rest of the fixes but I believe this may be a software issue of some sort.\n\nEDIT: I should also mention that I did update my adapter and router prior to even making this post, so they are up to date. I don't know if a wired connection would do any good but I'm not able to have one since I'd have to run the cable through doorways and such, and also buy a very long wire to accommodate that.\n\nI also already have peer to peer updates turned off via Control Panel. The only fix I really haven't done is the firewall, though the error that appears when League is blocked by a firewall is different from the one I am getting, and also I am able to get into the _second_  game of the day no problem without ever messing with it. Sorry, I'm not trying to be difficult. This just leads me to think one of the startup programs may be interfering with the connection League needs for the rift, but I'd have no idea how to narrow it down...","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
