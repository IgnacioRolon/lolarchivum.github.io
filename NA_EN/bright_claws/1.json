In fact, I&#039;m completely heart broken.\r\n\r\nShe may as well be a rock in the road, now. Why not just add a few balls and chains to weigh her down more?\r\n\r\nAhri takes so much perfect perception and timing. In return favoring you the possibility to not just go in to die. Now? Here, we buffed your stuffed but removed your ability to evade incoming attacks. HAVE FUN.\r\n\r\nNOT LIKE YOU NEED AN AOE SELF DEFENSE FORM OF PROTECTION WITH CC/ATTACK THAT YOU CAN HIT A TARGET WITH BY CLICKING ON THEM OR THAT CAN GO RIGHT THROUGH MINIONS\r\n{{champion:84}} {{champion:34}} {{champion:1}} {{champion:136}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:245}} {{champion:9}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:74}} {{champion:30}} {{champion:38}} {{champion:55}} {{champion:85}} {{champion:7}} {{champion:127}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:90}} {{champion:61}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:134}} {{champion:163}} {{champion:91}} {{champion:4}} {{champion:45}} {{champion:161}} {{champion:112}} .{{champion:8}} {{champion:101}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:115}} {{champion:142}} \r\n\r\nAND THEN THERE&#039;S JUST {{champion:103}} Q and E only goes in one direction. Only Q can go through minions/monsters. You can&#039;t target them at any one or pick an AOE location. W just pray and sprays where ever it wants to. R is just a copy of W with a wall hop distance x3 which can only be done WHEN ULTING. SO YEAH LETS JUST REMOVE &quot;Not So Fast&quot; FROM AHRI!\r\n\r\nGreat game.\r\n\r\n\r\nRIP Ahri December 14th, 2011 - April 18th, 2018. &quot;Speed of light?

Every time u used Q u stucked for a very slight moment on that spot, i rarely managed to dodge skills by using Q, mostly of the time i got that \"luck moment\" when i and enemy casted both our skills at once, and i could dodge while he couldn't. Anyways, i mean even if u die now, or get not as fed as before u basically have like a 100cs advantage at like 25min or so compared to the old Ahri for free, (that's how she feels to me tbh). And the new passive is pretty good aswell for teamfights.\n\nAlso in the end i'm not here to say you suck because you have a different opinion. Everyone has the right to have his own opinion, and the changes might hurt you, like u said, but most ahri mains just wanted changes in her kit, and riot had to react sooner or later^^ Hopefully you can recover from this and that you will like her a bit more sooner or later {{sticker:sg-ahri-2}} ","replies":[{"poster":"Bright Claws","date":"2018-04-23T02:17:46.020+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Skýcrow,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=0JQAWB7q,comment-id=000500000000,timestamp=2018-04-22T22:32:01.698+0000)\n>\n> But how?

I used it well. Or even getting around minions. Its too late though. I already refunded her and picked something else out. There's no way I can play her any more.
