I don't have specific names but \"Final Choice\" was definitely the intro. I think the second track that began at about 2:30 was the song used in the London video.\n\nI hope this helps. :)","replies":[{"poster":"Ashturion","date":"2016-09-07T22:49:47.982+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, i know.
