Now, it&#039;s here, and alive...\n\n--\n\nIs this discussion continuing?\n\n> [{quoted}](name=RiotSomeOtherGuy,realm=NA,application-id=2E4zVIwd,discussion-id=aMaqTYYY,comment-id=00010000000100000000,timestamp=2016-05-17T23:47:25.728+0000)\n> If software is available, people are going to use it, regardless of whether it&#x27;s officially supported. People are also going to run into problems, and ask for help, post bug reports, and maybe just have a bad experience. For &quot;power users&quot;, this might be totally acceptable, but we have to consider everyone, not just the power users.\n\nYou mean, just like the current situation w/ LoL and Wine?  I&#039;ve ditched Windows for... 10 years now?  The last thing to go was League of Legends, and that&#039;s just recently been basically fully featured; thanks to the hard work fo the Wine developers and users, of course.\n\nWhen Riot released a &quot;Mac OS client&quot; (hah... nice indir/compat layer; this is just, exactly, Wine...), I was **shattered** that they didn&#039;t support GNU/Linux too.  I mean, I imagined simply that, 1) the launcher was problematic, and 2) Riot couldn&#039;t figure out a packaging solution to allow marketing of Linux support.\n\n> Many of us here are huge fans of open source software, but it might not always make sense for all projects to be open sourced. That can turn into a pretty deep philosophical discussion ;)\n\n\nThen, how many times has the conversation come up around the office about the fact that, TransGaming Technologies&#039; Cider is based upon Wine, a FLOSS project?  I can&#039;t help but wonder if those engineers are shown the door and that contributes to Riot&#039;s &quot;eternally hiring soft. eng.s&quot; problem... /cynicism\n\n--\n\nAre you at least tracking to see which platforms your users are playing on?  Wine makes this simple, and I imagine Cider/Cedega do as well.  One employee mentions &quot;dozens,&quot; and I&#039;m confident that is a severe understatement.  If you&#039;re concerned about your users not trusting the application running well on their platform, why not publish the platform statistics/aggregates to help inform them?\n\nJust because your users value personal freedoms and e.g. the freedom of information, doesn&#039;t mean that Riot as a corporation has to turn a blind eye to them.  You&#039;re already raking in cash hand-over-fist; as another user said, just _glance_ outside, you&#039;ll be surprised.  If bureaucracy is the issue, I think you could rally users to help make your case.\n\nOtherwise... thanks for the game (truly, I love the game) but I&#039;m ditching the moment a truly cross-platform MOBA client catches my eye.\n\nIf you want help, or further input on e.g. the GNU/Linux packaging issues, please reach out to me and others!  _I hear Riot is always hiring soft. engs... :)_","replies":[{"poster":"Meriipu","date":"2016-10-20T08:05:08.114+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I use Linux to play and installing/launching the alpha client only required vcrun2013 as well as passing a --no-sandbox parameter because the webkit sandboxing I believe it was apparently does not play too well along with wine","replies":[{"poster":"Riot a huevo","date":"2016-10-20T16:25:59.177+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"That sounds very straightforward, I might try it, if I ever find the extra time :/ {{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"ReKlipz","date":"2016-10-20T17:29:07.120+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"On Debian, this is even simpler; I run Debian \"Sid\" (the unstable/bleeding-edge flavor of Debian), and installing League goes like this:\n\n> $ sudo aptitude update && sudo aptitude install wine-development winetricks\n> $ wget -O /tmp/lol_install.exe https://riotgamespatcher-a.akamaihd.net/ShellInstaller/NA/LeagueofLegends_NA_Installer_2016_05_13.exe\n> $ winetricks vcrun2005, ie8, corefonts, adobeair, d3dx9 && winetricks vista\n> $ wine /tmp/lol_install.exe\n\nIf you run an amd64 variant (\"64-bit\") of Debian (like myself, and I expect many others), you'll need to configure Debian to support the i386 variant (\"32-bit\") and install those packages instead, because League is a 32-bit Windows application.\n> $ sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386\n> $ sudo aptitude update && sudo aptitude install wine-development:i386 winetricks:i386\n\nPlaying the game is even simpler, :).","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Riot a huevo","date":"2016-10-20T07:07:16.516+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Are you at least tracking to see which platforms your users are playing on?\n\nOf course we are! Don't be silly, we are tracking lots of things ;)\n\n> If you want help, or further input on e.g. the GNU/Linux packaging issues, please reach out to me and others!\n\nThe issue is not wether we can build it or not; and I'm not saying it is easy or trivial at all. The problem is maintaining it.\n\nIn the original thread, the one you linked above, there is mention of all the things that need to be done every time a new patch comes out. There are QA tests, deploy pipelines and many many things around getting the binaries to the player's machines.\n\nJust as with a conventional product, even if you can produce it cheaply and easily, the process of getting it to a retail store might be what kills it because you have to think about customer support, packaging, delivery logistics etc.\n\n> I hear Riot is always hiring soft. engs... :)\n\nPlenty of opportunities for capable engineers, not only at Riot, but anywhere. There is simply not enough supply for the market's demands.","replies":[]}]}
