I simply wrote the name down of every friend on my friends list on a notepad file. a microsoft word file would work too. this way if you ever make a new account you can just add all your friends again. Because **** Riot :)","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-27T05:37:09.063+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not that we don't allow you to see your friends online because of the reason you mentioned (although you can actually see your friends outside of the client by using the mobile app....), it's more of a privacy issue.","replies":[{"poster":"RazgrizRevived","date":"2017-09-27T08:55:52.978+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How is it a privacy issue? That sounds like bs to me sorry. If a person can get into your website account, they can get into it on the client. So that really doesn't make any sense.\n\ninteresting. well you're company is also a totalitarian neo liberal dictatorship that is against free speech and freedom of expression. You're also statists. You also think your game is so important you should penalize people, even ban them from an account they spent money on, for quitting your game. That's how important you think you are. So it only made sense to me you would do everything possible to make people who are against your policies and beliefs to suffer as much as possible, even though anyone can buy a lvl 30 account with 10000 ip for 30-60 bucks every time you ban them for free speech or quitting the game (a game, that is just a game and has no effect on real life or any importance)\n\nHell, knowing your emotional marxist company i had to say this on a dummy account so my main ones don't get banned. \n\nBut please, if you really have an argument, explain to me how its a privacy issue. Also note most people aren't smart in passwords and they can be guessed within 1 week of a brute word attack.\n\nGood to hear the mobile app allows you to see your friends though. At least there is an escape.","replies":[]}]}]}
