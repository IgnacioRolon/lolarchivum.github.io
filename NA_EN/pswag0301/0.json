I don't have a PBE account and I cant purchase chests and all that to test the mechanics of the new loot chests. I was wondering if this was normal for a non PBE person to get the alpha launcher?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-14T21:01:25.279+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The Alpha Client and PBE are independent campaigns.  Anything that you do on Alpha client is in fact your Live account, not a PBE.  Share your feedback or issues you find with the community through the [alpha boards](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/AMiK4QqL-alpha-client-wont-work)!
