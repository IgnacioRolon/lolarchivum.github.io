Make it so that after so many stacks you no longer gain stacks from different camps. First you lose regular camps, stuff like scuttle, chickens and wolves.

Finally you only gain stacks from baron, elder dragon and kills and maybe assists, though you could make it lose stacking off of assists as well. This prevents the perma farming aspect of Wriggles/original devourer, and pushes it further into the healthy design that sated devour had going.\n\nThat said I'm biased in favor of the item, because I enjoyed it and its playstyle. I've never been able to figure out how to play early game junglers, so junglers that scale up and/or don't matter until 6 have always been my preferred champions.

There are few champions who can take full advantage of this mastery; namely ones with DPS and/or single-target spells. Also, they must be able to build full damage because DFT had, and still has, mediocre base damage but amazing scaling. \n\nTLD however, is usable by every champion, even though it is not the most optimal keystone for all of them. It is incredibly easy to proc (you just have to auto or hit spells until the enemy has 3 stacks, and unlike DFT it has no penalty for AoE/DoT spells), has a good base damage (you don't actually need to go full offense to make good use of it, but it is still better to go full offense to make its damage scale), and is placed on the Cunning tree which has a lot of generic masteries which are useful for every champion, unlike the Ferocity and Resolve trees which require more specific synergy with certain champion's kits.\n\nI remember back then, even when Deathfire Touch was too strong, it was still not used by every champion on every game. Other keystones were being used too, most notably Warlord's Bloodlust and Fervor of Battle, and when they fixed the weird bug, Thunderlord's Decree.\n\nThis latter was being used everygame due to the combination of being the most generic keystone (as explained above) combined with the fact that other keystones were gutted.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Meep Man","date":"2016-09-22T12:06:37.087+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, let's see here now...\n\n1.

It seems as though Riot focuses on nerfing the top two junglers and then the next top two and then the next top two, without many buffs to other junglers and it just cycles until there's an item or jungle change.\n\nThe items currently feel really good, people always go different smites for different situations, they use all the enchants for different junglers, people don't always have to rush the jungle item, there is choice in whether you complete your jungle item early or not. Yet the top two junglers will just continue to get big nerfs and other junglers get small buffs and it just ends up with jungle in this weird supportive low-income role and then there's jungle changes or item changes. \n\nI'd really like your opinion on these points specifically because it seems like this has been a reoccurring pattern over the last 3 years especially.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SlashStriker","date":"2016-09-22T18:24:42.804+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=fwbd1Jvv,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-09-21T20:33:00.795+0000)\n>\n> There&#x27;ll be some changes yes.
