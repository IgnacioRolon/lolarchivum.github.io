While Warwick sports a high Winrate and is popular he isn&#039;t nerf worthy. He fits his play style perfectly and his niche. He is an excellent duelist with hard snowball potential. \r\n\r\nHe also has obvious weaknesses. He isn&#039;t good in team fights and Grievous wounds cripples him. He doesn&#039;t have good objective control like lee sin or nunu and all of his damage is single Target. \r\n\r\nI really hope they keep warwick how he is because he fits his lore and play style perfectly without being overbearing and I see no reason to think that he is over powered","replies":[{"poster":"Attticus Finch","date":"2018-02-12T21:41:27.263+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"I see no reason to think that he is over powered\"\n\nHe has a 54% win rate with a 12% play-rate, which is massive.

Bot lane won't be  warding drake at 2:10 - 2:40 and neither will mid lane. Who would leave his lane at level 1 - 2 to try and ward/stop a double buffed jungler when he could be followed and killed in the river?\n\nDo you randomly get level 2 in lane and go into the river to see if the double buffed jungler is nearby?\n\nAlso good luck dueling warwick as a jungler at lvl 3, at best I'd guess a shyvanna with ignite stands a chance but not anyone else.\n\nYou're something else if you think this is normal and can be countered.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2018-02-12T23:16:34.575+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is not true of all damage junglers.
