I get that you played with him prior to this game but why spread the negativity? If you have bad feelings about the person, you should just keep it to yourself because all you're going to do is make other people give up faster. Not only have your teammates just been told you are tilted already, but you're also giving up already. So then your teammates are less likely to play as hard because they know they're already down to a 4v5 because you've given up.\n\nYou need to learn to handle difficult situations better. Sure it sucks to be in a game with someone who you had a bad experience with previously, but you have to just learn to let it go. They may have had a bad game in your past experience. This game could have been different but you didn't give the player the chance and you told your teammates you were giving up already. \n\nYou're on thin ice right now because after a 14 day ban, your next punishment is a permaban. \n\nYou flame once,  you argue once, you harass once... anything bad once... you're going to get a permaban. \n\nRead your pop up notice and take it seriously. Don't lose your champs. Don't lose your skins. \n\nIf you feel the urge to type, if it's because of any negative emotion, anger, frustration, hate, etc... don't type it. No sarcasm, no passive aggressiveness, no nothing. The IFS can pick up on sarcasm and so can player behavior specialists. Don't try to sneak some bad comments in there because you think you will get away with it.","replies":[{"poster":"ghands85","date":"2018-03-27T03:28:03.201+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thank you for reply without being demeaning, i just wanted to see if this was something that was caught just because my whole team reported me or because it was actually wrong, personally i dont think i did enough wrong given here to warrant 14 day suspension, but it is what it is, i feel like the judgement on this is screwed in the whole conversation of schemes, you'd notice i only ever typed the game listed was when i was replying to my flaming team, after scrutinizing someone for their past mistakes \"innocent until proven guilty\" this guy was guilty of his bad behavior, so i didnt feel i should have had to respect that, however i will own up and say it was my bad i shouldnt have came out and told the team he was going to be toxic feed then afk, like he did in two games league queued me with him in less than 4 hours time span","replies":[{"poster":"Chermorg","date":"2018-03-27T04:21:14.657+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm slightly curious - were you on chat restriction during this game? The length of message and low number makes me suspect you may have been.\n\nIf you were, know that while restricted your behavior will be examined more closely than a clean account. The idea being that you are serving a punishment for negativity already - and if you show that you're going to continue to be negative, even in only one game, while on punishment, it's obviously not working.\n\nPlease keep in mind as someone else said that after the 14 day ban, even \"light\" negativity in as little as one game can get your account permanently banned. I strongly recommend taking a step back and finding the fun again - because if you're not having fun and enjoying yourself now, you'll be having even less fun when permanently banned.\n\nAnd that seems to be the root of the problem - your fun was negatively impacted by others, thus you flame them for it. You can't control others, as much as we would like to. All you can control is yourself - so make yourself have fun even if you're losing. It takes effort. But it is possible.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-03-27T02:34:16.816+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"You started off by flaming him and continued to do so. And going by the previous game, you also threw it, likely flaming him.\n\nHis past games show he is not a troll at all, just likely not capable of carrying your dead weight. Your past games, on the other hand.. While not trolling, it does not look like you have a right to call anyone else out for playing badly.\n\nNext time is permban. Take a step back and think about things a little more objectively.","replies":[{"poster":"ghands85","date":"2018-03-27T03:00:00.528+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"all you did was insult me and say that it was my fault, im not saying its not, but im saying its not viable for a  14 day suspension. you need to relook your ethics because you and that ezreal seem to have a lot in common bud :)","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-03-27T03:03:03.546+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ghands85,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=BwjLUYAR,comment-id=00000004,timestamp=2018-03-27T03:00:00.528+0000)\n>\n> all you did was insult me and say that it was my fault, im not saying its not, but im saying its not viable for a  14 day suspension. you need to relook your ethics because you and that ezreal seem to have a lot in common bud :)\n\nIt is actually quite viable for a 14 day suspension, since you spent two games tilting yourself, throwing, and flaming a teammate (you cant even get punished for one game unless it was extreme), especially since it is a final warning after repeated restrictions.\n\nI respect your total denial that any of it is your fault, but if you keep it up, you get permbanned.\n\nAlso consider responding once instead of making half a dozen passive-aggressive rage shitposts.\n\nAlso, i can see your match history. You went support in both games, and threw in both games - or at least played support very poorly.","replies":[{"poster":"ghands85","date":"2018-03-27T03:23:12.628+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"once again all you do is post shit-talk, in several comments i said i saw my fault, but didnt think it was 14 day suspension worthy, and once again, no i was mid that game you, lulu mid nice try though, and no i didnt throw either game, so instead of being a self certified ASS seeing as you assumed once again, please leave my page so someone helpful can try to read and comment","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-03-27T20:02:37.574+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ghands85,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=BwjLUYAR,comment-id=0000000400000000,timestamp=2018-03-27T03:23:12.628+0000)\n>\n> once again all you do is post shit-talk, in several comments i said i saw my fault, but didnt think it was 14 day suspension worthy, and once again, no i was mid that game you, lulu mid nice try though, and no i didnt throw either game, so instead of being a self certified ASS seeing as you assumed once again, please leave my page so someone helpful can try to read and comment\n\nI can still see your match history. I assumed nothing.\n\nIt kind of proves you played morgana support in the game you got banned for.\n\nEither way you still flamed your team twice and got banned, semantics and distraction wont change that.\n\nMaybe instead of having a meltdown on the boards as well, you should consider how much you value your account and if you really want to continue behaving like this.\n\nI mean, i know we will see your \"WHY PERM?? RITO BAD\" post in two weeks regardless, people like you cant learn or you would never reach a 2-week in the first place.
