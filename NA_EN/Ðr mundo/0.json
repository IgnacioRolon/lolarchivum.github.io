So when I play Mundo I offen time do good or at least hold my own in lane/fights but by the time I get into mid/lategame all it takes is one person to build a Mortal Reminder and now poof im now dieing in about 5-8 sec in a teamfight and now no more usefull than a wet paper bag. Call me crazy but check my history, I will oftentimes do very good if they dont build said item or similar ones but I lose almost every game that the oponents do.\r\n\r\nSo my last remarks are as follows, should I give up on my main of 3 years to find a new champ that can actually be usefull in lategame because of like 1 or 2 items that compleatly shut him down.","replies":[{"poster":"astralwit","date":"2016-08-26T11:28:58.781+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"His AA range is stupidly short for a champion with no gap closer. He should have the same range as Sion or Naut.\n\nAlso, it's a misconception that Mundo's a late game champion. He spikes mid game and falls off.","replies":[{"poster":"dominusx","date":"2016-08-26T11:30:22.467+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i wouldnt mind that aswell even tho i dont play him it will prolly helphim out. maybe add a slow on his E 1st hit aswell","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Evewynn","date":"2016-08-26T11:39:44.010+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm surprised you lasted this long honestly.","replies":[]},{"poster":"dominusx","date":"2016-08-26T11:31:31.764+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"No that's the counterplay to Mundo otherwhise he just never dies you remember older seasons Mundo where he would walk into 5 people and come out 70% hp. As Astralwit said buff his aa range and make his E slow on 1st hit so he can do his dmg before he dies.Not to mention barely any people build reminder","replies":[{"poster":"Ðr Mundo","date":"2016-08-28T06:16:14.262+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is true not many build reminder but when I play mundo everyone does.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Bultz","date":"2016-08-26T13:09:56.937+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just read a similar thread and i agree. i built 400 armor and 200ish magic resist on Nasus a few times, I get insta melted.

It's because the tank meta is long over, and people need to realize this.\n\nAnd they also need to realize that most of the time adcs don't bother buying ANY (anti-tank) pen items in your elo, at all. Most of the time getting to full build without one, even while against 2-3 tanks...  but the times that they do get one, tanks drop just as fast as anything.  And both situations are a problem.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Meep Man","date":"2016-08-26T11:43:20.092+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think Mundo needs to be buffed to be the super HP Tank. Like, get stupid HP growth per level and have amazing Level 1 Health. Have his pssive or ultimate give him like a passive 10/17.5/25% increased bonus health.
