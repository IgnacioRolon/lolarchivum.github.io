I don&#039;t really care if i get 5v4ed though I do not play ranked.    What i noticed was that two remakes in a row ate up maybe 15 min.   Now not the worst thing in my case, but if it happened in a ranked it could eat up a much larger chunk of time even approaching maybe even 30 min for 2 remakes.   If someone were to get very unlucky and have a 3rd remaking in a row, for a lot of people it may mean game night over without every even have played?  I have another gripe about it,  when looking at my match history in my profile it used to be a red bar for loss and green for a win. Now that remakes are added and add a red bar no matter what side ff.   Since it seems 1 in 4 games is a remake,  its hard for me to tell at a glance what my recent history has been.   I  know that&#039;s rather minor complaint but does riot really want its program to feel less streamlined?    Perhaps if player involved in the remake were to get some kind of small bonus.... 20ip or something it would seem a little better.    Also i really think they should not show up in match history or should be a third color.  What do other people think?","replies":[{"poster":"Vindictive Ex Gf","date":"2016-06-17T15:48:04.795+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol Why should they pay you ip for not having played? This isn't a job you don't get paid for your time. I personally think that remake thing is silly. That said you have a point about it being a different color. It should show up grey or something. Sucks to look at match history and not be able to see the difference. But yeah your bonus is not having to play a 4v5.","replies":[{"poster":"Red Thought","date":"2016-06-18T07:23:49.536+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The reason i said that was because waiting for 30 min to get into a game so that you can play is not cool.    i would rather play a loosing game that wait 30 min not playing......","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2016-06-17T14:34:43.450+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"ok so its better if that person just wastes an entire game 4v5 then?\n\nAt least they had the chance to remake 2 more times.  And you have to be incredibly unlucky to get 3 afks in a row back to back that doesn't happen very often.","replies":[{"poster":"Red Thought","date":"2016-06-18T07:25:07.368+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A 4v5 game is better than not playing, though after today's experience it could perhaps just the system punishing all of the bad players who quit for no reason or have bugs","replies":[{"poster":"Red Thought","date":"2016-06-18T07:25:31.975+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I did not have a remake today and was happy","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Red Thought","date":"2016-06-18T07:22:48.179+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok so update.
