At the same time the number of reworks increased. Riot has said recently they&#039;ll be increasing the number of VGUs and decreasing releases so maybe we&#039;re at the beginning of another era.\n\n# Analyzing Rate of Content\n\n[Rate of Content (Smoothed over 3 instances)](https://i.imgur.com/InJK73t.png)\n\n**Marked Points of Interest**\n\n**Fastest Release Rate(2009-09-19):** The 8 champions from Gangplank to Katarina took 43 days to release.\n**Slowest Release Rate(2014-08-14):** Vel&#039;Koz, Braum and Gnar took 244 days to release.\n\n**Fastest Rework Rate(2016-09-08):** The 16 mages in the mage update, Yorick and one of the Ryze updates took 142 days.\n**Slowest Rework Rate(2012-01-16):** Tryndamere, Sivir and Jax reworks took 266 days.\n\n**Fastest Combined Rate(2016-05-18):** Taric Rework, Mage update and Taliyah&#039;s Release took 55 days.\n**Slowest Combined Rate(2018-03-07):** Zoe, Swain&#039;s Rework and Kai&#039;sa took 148 days.\n\nAlso fun to note, that giant dip at the end of 2009-beginning of 2010 is Riot&#039;s first Christmas break after the release of League of Legends :)\n\n# Number of Official Reworks per Champion\n\nRiot has a page that I&#039;ll link below that shows every update they&#039;ve done that they consider a rework so here&#039;s how many each champion has had.\n\n|-----------------------Num------------------------|Champions|\n|-\n|3 (1)|Ryze|\n|2 (16)|Cassiopeia, Evelynn, Fiddlesticks, Gangplank, Garen, Katarina, Miss Fortune, Mordekaiser, Rengar, Sejuani, Sivir, Skarner, Swain, Viktor, Xerath, Xin Zhao|\n|1 (54)|Akali, Alistar, Anivia, Annie, Brand, Caitlyn, Corki, Darius, Ekko, Fiora, Fizz, Galio, Gragas, Graves, Heimerdinger, Irelia, Jax, Karma, Kassadin, Kayle, Kennen, Kha&#039;zix, Kog&#039;maw, Leblanc, Malzahar, Maokai, Master Yi, Nidalee, Olaf, Poppy, Quinn, Shaco, Shen, Sion, Sona, Soraka, Syndra, Talon, Taric, Tristana, Trundle, Tryndamere, Twitch, Urgot, Veigar, Vel&#039;koz, Vladimir, Warwick, Yorick, Zac, Zed, Ziggs, Zilean, Zyra|\n|0 (69)|Everyone else.|\n\n# Lovebirds\n\nThe lovebird champions Xayah and Rakan were released together but they aren&#039;t the only release couple in League (◕‿◕✿).\n\n|Set|Champions|\n|-|-|\n|Release|The 17 champions on release.|\n|Four|{{champion:53}}{{champion:36}}{{champion:40}}{{champion:54}}|\n|Three|{{champion:28}}{{champion:23}}{{champion:29}}|\n|Lovebirds|{{champion:27}}{{champion:26}} \\* {{champion:32}}{{champion:31}} \\* {{champion:34}}{{champion:33}} \\* {{champion:41}}{{champion:44}} \\* {{champion:42}}{{champion:55}} \\* {{champion:74}}{{champion:35}} \\* {{champion:79}}{{champion:80}} \\* {{champion:497}}{{champion:498}}|\n\n#Extras\n\n[Non-Smoothed Rate of Content](https://i.imgur.com/A58jJfw.png)\n\nI&#039;ve also marked the maxes and mins on this chart and the only ones that drastically change from the smoothed version are:\n\n**Slowest Release Rate(2018-03-07):** Kai&#039;Sa was released 106 days after Zoe.\n\n**Slowest Rework Rate(2013-03-27):** The Karma rework happened 225 days after the Katarina rework.\n\n#Data CSVs\n\nIf you would like to play around with the data yourself here it is in CSV format.
