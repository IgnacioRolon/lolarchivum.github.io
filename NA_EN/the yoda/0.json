You have had 4 punishments in less than 2 months. Punishments start off light to remind people their behavior is unacceptable by community standards. You did not change your behavior after numerous punishments, which serve as warnings. In your last punishment, you were told that further similar behavior would result in a perma-ban. You continued this behavior so you were issues a perma-ban.\n\nThe vast majority of players never receive a single punishment. Beyond that, the vast majority who receive a single punishment never receive another. Achieving the number of punishments you did in such a short period of time, along with the recent game you played where you showed no willingness to change your behavior, was enough to be certain your account should be perma-banned.","replies":[{"poster":"Yuri By Mail","date":"2016-06-09T04:47:07.057+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{summoner:11}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Yoda","date":"2016-06-08T12:03:35.346+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"I am more than sure that I never received any warnings. I would remember them, honestly this just shows how much you guys really care about your more veteran players (I began around when Aatrox came out, so like S3'ish). I really see that riot likes to give people a chance to reform accounts back to a non toxic state, but you know, who listens to the community/toxic player? I'm relatively disappointed with this response from a Riot employee, this is why you guys have such a horrid community. Have you even explored the depths that are low silver/bronze elo? Honestly, i'm fine with how this turned out, I understand the punishment and all.

Like, he's not just making it up.\n\nAnd Riot does forgive/forget. It's why, if after receiving a punishment, you keep your nose clean for a while, your punishment level drops. Forgiveness is given to those that show remorse. You didn't and continued to do the things that got you in trouble in the first place. Stop pretending to be a victim of a system that doesn't care, even though you were given multiple chances to reform your behavior.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sqkerg","date":"2016-06-08T04:51:01.306+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Quick question, are all perms bans manually reviewed?

There is a tiered punishment system in place to track player behaviour patterns and escalate punishments as the negative behaviour continues. Most players who receive and automatic Perma Ban either cheated or were extremely toxic in chat including racism, sexism, or death threats. \n\nHowever if that is not the case then it is more likely that you have been slowly progressing up the punishment ladder, receiving chat restrictions and minor suspensions. If that is infact true then the the chat log your provided is one of many instances where you were toxic and were accurately reported in your matches. It would seem to me that you used up your first three strikes and did not change your behaviour. Therefore the final strike is permanent as the system has seen nothing to suggest your behaviour was improving.\n\nPlease note that the chat log you received is just a sample provided as an example of your behaviour.
