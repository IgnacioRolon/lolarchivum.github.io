And the adventure became a grind of the same missions over and over.\n\nI loved the game too. But Bungie ruined it.

There's a really good game in there somewhere, and when House of Wolves comes in, I'll revisit it, but people hate the grind, not the fact that you needed Vex Mythoclast (which was briefly Destiny's Irelia once it became the dominant weapon).","replies":[{"poster":"OyddAWqJ5r","date":"2015-01-24T21:10:22.728+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's both. And I left because of both.\n\nPeople who like PvE and Adventure were disappointed with the repetitive grind and 'increased difficulty' being a simple up in enemy health and damage (cuz difficulty = extra hours worth of health apparently).\n\nAnd then there's people who like PvP (me being one of them), who were completely shunned and cast off by the disgusting overpowering of the Vex Mythoclast, completely eliminating versatility in weapon usage (though Thorn and Suros users had some success, there is no denying that they could near double their kd's given a Mythoclast). I loved the PvP. I'd outplay everyone and it was awesome for me to be able to win through skill and even lose through enemy skill. But the Mythoclast introduced extremely shorter kill times which leaves less room for outplays and shifts it from the more Halo experience to the pre-Advanced Warfare CoD experience -- which is something I detest. Alongside, I reinstate, the lack of versatility due to it's gross overpowered state the Crucible became one of the more toxic experiences of the game, leaving only PvE to really have fun in.\n\nBut like we said, the grind and repetitiveness killed it. They screwed up when they went with the old Halo-style difficulty where higher difficulty = more health/shields instead of going with a more Diablo-esque difficulty system where new enemy abilities or even new stage hazards occur. Noone likes unloading 5 clips into an enemy -- feeling weak isn't cool. Having a more dynamic experience filled with more hazards while dropping enemies quickly is a much more fun experience. But alas, I'm not a Bungie employee.\n\nBut most of the Preseason League BS has been fleshed out and is alot more stable now. So I'm back here from my Destiny vacation and don't plan on returning until things have been fixed or just to get my 4 hours worth of play out of House of Wolves.\n\nBtw the Mythoclast is still the Irelia.

You're stuck on how bad it looks to be in bronze because you feel you aren't a bronze player. A few things to note.\n\nA. No one doing promos can get a higher rank than plat 1, not even challenger players.\n\nB. Your **RANKED** MMR from last season highly predetermines what league you will be placed in.\n\nIt doesnt matter if you go 10/10 or 0/10 what matters is your previous MMR. If you were consistent the 10 provisional games will have little impact , either placing you slightly below or keeping you at your previous League. This isn't about being labeled a bronze player unjustly necessarily, moreso Season 5 from what it looks like is going to be more competitive from the start. \n\nWith the hard cap being plat 1 and only players with extremely high MMR reaching that league, where you place now is going to heavily depend on your Ranked MMR. If the players around your ranked MMR, lets say for instance OP's which is 1,195 with the bronze I league average of 1, 239 MMR; then you will be placed in that league of bronze I because thats the average of those players. \n\nBecause of the rest the leagues are going to be more competitive, your current MMR may represent a lower league than last season. For some their higher MMR's placed them at a higher league than last, if you find yourself dropping leagues you need to win games it's as simple as that. No one is placing into diamond or challenger from provisionals, so when you tell me that you went from Silver V to Bronze IV what it tells me is that your MMR is representative of season 5 bronze IV players.

This current season is hardly reflecting last season mmr. In most cases it has just been putting people in lower elos.\n I was gold V last season which i had gotten to twice. Got to gold V from silver 4 over a long period of time than I stopped playing league for a while so my rank dropped to silver 2, but as you should know your mmr does not change when you don't play ranked just your rank.( and this pretty much happened right before they made it so your rank couldn't decay a whole tier). Than I got back to gold shortly after I started playing again, so my mmr would still be gold and should not have been any lower. But after my placements this season going 5-5 i was put into silver 3. If it was truly based on mmr i should have been placed in silver 1/gold 5 since it was a 50% win rate and if you have a 50% winrate your mmr won't change. \nThe way I see it is that they have done whatever they can to place your rank as low as possible. If you are gold and win half of your games you will be placed in silver, if you are silver you will almost always be placed in bronze, If you are plat and lose most of your placement matches than you will also be placed in silver.

The main problem is people think they are better than what they actually are. I should be in silver 1 but im stuck in silver 5 because I always get feeders etc. The problem is most people make excuses because they can't handle failure and the truth.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Tommy Titty Tats","date":"2015-01-24T10:14:48.677+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"This is fucking stupid riot come on you should even be smart enough to stop being lazy and make a legit promo system. You are the reason i am stuck in bronze i just won 8 out of 10 games and i finished B1 in season 4 and you mean to tell me i deserve to be in bronze 5. I really hate this system and something needs to change now before i {{summoner:4}} my ass back to counterstrike and leave this trash","replies":[]},{"poster":"ChrisB5","date":"2015-01-24T02:50:20.270+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Keep in mind Riot did say they put a soft reset on your ladder ranking from last season.  This is still pretty ridiculous.  With all green you shouldn't be pushed down, especially not that far!

Even when I played very well and lost not all my fault I still ended up in Bronze 5, so honestly what ever calculations they have done this season has definitely screwed over majority of the people who play rank.
