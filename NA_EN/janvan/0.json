Will it kill the future of this game or will it keep it relevant and alive?\r\n\r\n My opinion is that Streamers will kill this sport.  I think the esport aspect is amazing and I love watching anything that Riot puts out there.  I also love content from companies like proguides, mobalytics,etc that give great content on how to improve.   \r\n\r\nBut twitch streamers which i would say used to be good and provided good content have what I would call become the soap opera of league of legends.  \r\nOr maybe even better is they provide a Jerry Springer type entertainment.  I dont think it is good for the community.  I think it teaches kids especially the younger kids that they can be toxic and get away with it because there favorite streamer is as well.  \r\n\r\n\r\nThoughts?","replies":[]}
