It's not the worst thing because this wasn't that hard of a choice usually but I don't like the trend. I still remember when you guys had the cool smites on monsters doing different things (such as scouting a path).

Unlike chess, or Starcraft or a million other activities, every few months it's a different wave of viable champions, completely different viability of champions/items... need to throw all my theorycrafting and builds in the trash, champs suddenly become unviable in roles I used to like playing them (bye AP Kog, bye Kench JG etc.).

Item diversity seems to be decreasing, which really detracts from the game.

Part of what makes League so appealing is it's strategic depth. \n\nUnfortunately, while the item aspect of the game revolves around building for each game, in practice the core items are always focused anyway, maybe change up the build order and have 1 or 2 items that are situational.\n\nI know Riot wants to keep League fresh and exciting, but simplifying the game would have an adverse effect.\n\nBack to jg items: I think red smite should definitely continue, but pink smite should be added.  If I recall correctly, there was also a grey smite once as well.\n\nOf course, if pink smite is included, expect that to be almost the unanimous choice in LCS.\n\nI'd love to see vision item options for all roles, especially since in solo queue mid laners and ADCs have to rely on their  teammates for vision, which is no guarantee.
