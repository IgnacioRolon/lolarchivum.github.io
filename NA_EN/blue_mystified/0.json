The reasons I left are as follows:\r\n\r\n1) Toxicity\r\nmy gf literally cried just reading some of the stuff people would tell me in game and i would just shrug it off. I realized being exposed to that much constant negativity was extremely unhealthy for me. Has the community changed at all? even slightly?\r\n\r\n2) Length\r\nI left this game around when overewatch came out and used that as a replacement because the match times were effectively a half/ one third of what the game times are here. I hear from a few posts saying the biggest change is that snowball meta is out of control and first blood basically wins the game now. is that true? what&#039;s the average game length- still up to 40 minutes? \r\n\r\n3) Bard\r\nliterally the only reason I thought of this recently was i saw fan art of Bard and remembered my eternal love for him. I then learned from a friend who got into it recently that he&#039;s meta right now- is this true? Is there really a return of utility supports? I hated tank support meta (even though i rode it on leona and braum) and i&#039;ve always loved lulu, janna, bard type supports.\r\n\r\n4) Rune Changes\r\nI just read the headlines about that and I must say that&#039;s exciting. I&#039;ll probably be getting about 20k in &quot;blue essence&quot; or whatever back. When do those changes come? should i wait until then?\r\n\r\nI would like some nice responses to these questions. I&#039;ve read plenty of other &quot;should i come back&quot; posts but they never quite answered exactly what I was thinking, so I appreciate any kind replies you guys might have. (primarily cos a ton of those posts were basically just &quot;is yasuo still op&quot;)","replies":[]}
