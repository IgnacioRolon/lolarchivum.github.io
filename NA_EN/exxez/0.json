I originally want to make the design kind of reptileish, but then i figured it would be to similar to the zerg if it was to fleshy. So i decided o make the blades around her head have kind of a corbra esc look to them. Also I made the colors really dull cause while looking up spiders I read that female spiders are generally larger while males are smaller with colorful stripes or spots. So I made the design really big and the colors dull because its the color of the males that should attract the female\n\nedit:\nhttp://fc03.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2014/226/7/9/c_by_kyrin21-d7v6x44.jpg \nsome additional color schemes to make her feel more void-like","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2014-08-15T16:59:55.308+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really like the design of her, especially her head! \n\nIf we're talking void creatures, I'd like to see her in the more purple / green color scheme's you've posted further down. \n\nDo you have the reference of the centipede photo?

(only the voice in fact who make the champ female)\n\nThe main reason I choose those species is that as they most likely become the only champ for their tribe (don't think riot would make an other cho'gat or kah'zix species for exemple),  the fact that it is a female who is send to this world must be because the female version is much stronger than the male version.\n\nFor the ant, a queen who come to lead the void creature had some sense since it's the only insect who as that kind of hierarchy.\nFor wasp, it's basically because it's the most dangerous insect for human beeing (put aside mosquito), bring it in runeterra is a good move for a void invasion and the female are more agressives.\nMoth are silent and sneaky, it's the perfect spy for void and probably the invertabrate who could fit the support role the best (I want a full team void^^) and a male supp from void seems \"meh\" since they are most into the destroy way of life^^","replies":[{"poster":"Exxez","date":"2014-08-15T19:50:27.663+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"that makes a lot of sense, I like where your coming from with that\nI honestly had an idea of a hornet/bat type creature that would use sound but the centipede looks cool I had to make a design around it\n\nbut whether a void champ is male or female, void creatures consume everything for one reason or another. In the case of some kind of female void champ. I'd imagine it to be a broodmother type champion who consumes to feed her hive\n\nwhich in a way would work with kog'maw, since hes a wee little baby","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"2nd Fiddle","date":"2014-08-15T18:01:55.459+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is  that natural camouflage or real moss?","replies":[{"poster":"Exxez","date":"2014-08-15T18:08:18.133+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"its actual moss","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Valdr","date":"2014-08-15T23:15:48.062+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Reg'nox, the Hive Queen\npopped into my head instantly with all the insectoid references :D","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"SnugglyBunnies","date":"2014-08-15T02:14:30.809+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Elise is already a scary monster.
