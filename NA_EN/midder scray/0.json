It doesn&#039;t even make the noise it usually does when I transform, and it&#039;s really bothering me\r\n\r\nAgain, I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s just for Elise or other champions as well, but after this game I&#039;m gonna try repairing my client or something, because I do know this has happened before, I just don&#039;t remember how I fixed it. If anyone has any suggestions or ideas, please let me know\r\n\r\nThanks guys","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Ranger XIV","date":"2016-02-26T05:17:40.875+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey MIdder Scray,\n\nWe are aware of the issue with Elise.
