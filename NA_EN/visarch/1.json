If you combine this rapid bleed with ignite AND electrocute, HE WILL kill you VERY QUICKLY. His bleed isn't the same as Darius's (Where his slowly does minor dot over time until he reaches five stacks.) Talon's bleed last 2-3 seconds, and remember IT'S HEAVY DAMAGE. This is why \"Talon scores 25% of first bloods\" is such a meme, because squishies in mid will DIE VERY FAST from levels 2-3. DO NOT. PLAY. SQUISHY. IMMOBILE. MAGES.

Vlad can stay safe out of range and immediately use his w to escape Talon's damage.

Try to stay at the edge of his W range so that he can't W > Q > auto you and bully him with your range advantage. If he pokes you with his W, step to the side so that the returning blades won't give him a second stack on you. Play off of your minion waves and you should do fine.\n\nHis Q has a range of 575, less than the range of an auto attack of most ADCs in the game. Almost every caster in the game has more range on many of their abilities than that, and can poke him hard if he gets too close. \n\nHope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"VisArch","date":"2019-03-08T17:49:24.205+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It helps thank you.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"I love cowboys","date":"2019-03-06T18:19:26.466+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did you know Talon is responsible for 25% of first bloods?","replies":[{"poster":"VisArch","date":"2019-03-06T18:41:06.233+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"is that a game bug ?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"LatoyaFromTheBX","date":"2019-03-06T20:49:15.097+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"you got punished by underestimating his level 3 powerspike","replies":[{"poster":"VisArch","date":"2019-03-07T14:35:13.489+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I noticed that when I died.\nPunished with instant death !!!!!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"The thigh guy","date":"2019-03-06T17:41:54.545+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"Welcome to the zero counterplay bs that is assassins","replies":[{"poster":"ApathyAndGrief","date":"2019-03-06T18:15:43.813+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=The thigh guy,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=sLqJaAMK,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2019-03-06T17:41:54.545+0000)\n>\n> Welcome to the zero counterplay bs that is assassins\n\nPlay a Tank mid and piss them off","replies":[{"poster":"Doge2020","date":"2019-03-06T18:55:13.475+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Malphite mid lol","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Galaxyburstz","date":"2019-03-06T17:18:08.726+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"burst meta q _ q","replies":[]},{"poster":"The thigh guy","date":"2019-03-08T18:54:38.109+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Careful using any logical argument.
