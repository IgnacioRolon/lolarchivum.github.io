Look at job postings of the job you want -- e.g. [Software Engineer at Riot](http://www.riotgames.com/careers/10838) -- and think about applying for it right now. Really think about where you are compared to the requirements/desirables, if the description/requirements really sound like what you want to do (we aren't always right about the job we want, I wasn't! That'd be in my #10), etc.  This is something I wish I did more back in high school / college to help center myself / understand how valuable certain parts of my education were.  And to tie that in, use what you learned about gaps between you and what you want to drive personal projects, part-time jobs / undergrad research / etc.  Of course, hopefully those things are already things you want to do (or maybe you don't want the job you think you want), but it certainly helps with focus and makes it all the more rewarding.\n\nAt least, that advice would've been great for me, YMMV :) I certainly felt like a \"loosely guided missile\" through too much of my academic career :P","replies":[{"poster":"Noobspectivee","date":"2016-04-14T01:17:52.704+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"thanks!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Noobspectivee","date":"2016-04-14T00:40:41.817+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey!

James Leitch\n2. Software Engineering (diploma says \"Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering\")\n3. Champion team at Riot Games (same as Aaron)\n4. I'll try to answer questions posted here or friend me in game.\n5. My career so far has been all gameplay stuff, which means working with designers (or other content creators) and building/improving systems to support the features they want.  This can range from small things like hooking up an existing aim assist system, through larger things like building a buff system to drive elemental weapons and abilities/power ups (both examples taken from my previous job).\n6. Software Engineer\n7. Same as Aaron with regards to champions: build/debug/extend tech to support upcoming champions, while also trying to gradually improve the existing tech.  Champs I've helped worked on are Azir, Kalista, Aurelion Sol, and some minor support for Gnar, Rek'sai, Bard.\n8. Usually around 11-7, periodically staying later if I'm really focused on something or there's a deadline.\n9. Where I grew up there weren't any AP classes, so I just took the normal stuff in high school.  After graduating, I went into general engineering at University of Calgary.  I chose engineering over science because it sounded cooler.  Between 1st and 2nd year of university, I took a year off -- during which time I figured out I wanted to go into software and into games.  After that I came back and chose Software Engineering as my major.  Between 3rd and 4th year I interned at an educational software/hardware company, which is where I learned most of my practical skills (internships are important!).  After interning, I finished my degree, graduated, and started at EA, where I worked for 2 years before getting my current job at Riot.  It's worth noting that I started coding in grade 8, but I only ever thought of it as a hobby until I took that time off and decided it was what I wanted to do professionally.\n10. I would take the compiler class at university that I didn't want to get up for (it was at 8 AM).  I would also suggest working on games in Unity/UE4 to build up a portfolio.  I had tried to build a game/engine from scratch, which was a great experience, but not as relevant as building/working on gameplay systems, which is what you'd be doing in Unity/UE4.\n11. Be appreciative of how and why things work, not just that they do work.  Curiosity and desire to learn are hugely important traits.  Also try to work on some long term personal projects.  I found a lot of school work didn't do a good job of preparing me for real work, because generally assignments involved solving individual problems in a vacuum, where the code is written once, and then thrown away.  As a result, considerations like performance, maintainability, and extensibility get overlooked.  Having something you work on over the course of several years will hopefully help build up these skills, in addition to whatever you learn in school.\n\nCheers,\nJames","replies":[{"poster":"Prospectivee","date":"2016-04-14T01:11:54.926+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just want to let you know that I appreciate you.

I gained a tonne of valuable experience over the course of my 16 month internship (and getting paid for a year between 3rd/4th year was great too).

Bachelor of Applied Science in Computer Engineering with a minor in Cognitive Science\n3. Game Systems team at Riot Games\n4. Friend me in Game\n5. My degree is an intersection of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering - both writing software as well as building analog and digital circuits.  I've only ever professionally done software, although I've done it at many levels (web services, game logic, graphics drivers, line of business applications, etc.)\n6. Software Engineer\n7. I'm the tech lead for a new feature we're working on that involves touching a large number of different tech stacks.  This means I write a lot of different kinds of code and am ultimately responsible for the technical quality of the work others are doing on these features.  The latter primarily involves talking to people and doing architectural and code review.  I also fix bugs in random systems like champion select, runes and masteries, in game items, vision stuff, etc.\n8. I usually work from about 8am to 6pm, although it varies and I have a lot of freedom to shift this around according to my needs.\n9. In high school I took every math, computer science (which my school offered) and science class (other than biology, which i now wish I had taken) class they offered.  I TA'd Chemistry twice and took AP Physics and Chemistry.  I was admitted to Computer Engineering at the University of Waterloo, which is a 5 year bachelor's program where you alternate 4 months school, 4 months internship.  I ended up doing 6 internships at 5 places (two at a small .NET shop, one at Epson, one at Apple, one at Deloitte, and one at Microsoft).  I took mostly digital logic (FPGA stuff, processor pipelining) and software courses, and dabbled in analog circuits.  I failed 3 courses one term because I was doing too many extracurricular things and overloaded my term taking 7 classes at once, but talked my self out of being held back with the help of the Engineering society.  When I graduated I got a job working on Xbox Live, and then on Halo at 343 Industries before coming to Riot.\n10.  I would have taken more Biology stuff.  In my opinion Genetic Engineering is going to be the next big paradigm shift on the scale of what software was and I would be better positioned to follow that with a bit more academic rigor.  I don't really regret failing those courses, it's important to hit walls in your life so you can overcome them and it was character building.\n11.  Network.  Figure out what you want to do and attack that thing, do stuff in your spare time, go to conferences and meet people.  Have opinions on things that are well developed and that you can articulate.  Be interesting.  I got my first internship because I had joined the ASIC club and helped design a phase-locked loop in Cadence.  This had absolutely nothing to do with anything the company wanted me to do, but it made me stand out from the other 100 people that were applying for jobs in my class.  I suspect I have gotten interviews because my resume talks about being interested in Bees (and I can describe in 30 seconds some interesting things about a bee's visual system when they ask me about it).\n\nCheers!","replies":[{"poster":"Prospectivee","date":"2016-04-14T01:12:42.967+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thank you for taking the time to help some weird students out!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DizzyKa","date":"2016-04-14T01:29:27.461+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Noobspectivee,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=G43hAV7A,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-04-13T01:29:04.628+0000)\n>\n> I have a school assignment to interview a gaming software engineer and so I choose Riot Games.

Amelia Von Haden\n2.) Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering\n3.) Experimental Gameplay Team on League of Legends\n4.) Friend Aaron, he can get you mine as well ; )\n5.) Game engineering in a general sense is the creation and simulation of virtual worlds and their ancillary components. Some game engineers specialize in networking systems that send information between instances of the game and different kinds of servers. Others specialize in rendering, building visual simulations that produce a viewport into the simulation. Some engineers build tools to allow content creators to author content like VFX, animation, and AI. I'm a game engineer that specializes in gameplay so I build systems that simulate movement, camera, inventories, combat and so on.\n6.) I prefer Gameplay Programmer.\n7. ) Gameplay Programmers work closely  with Designers, Animators, VFX Artists, 3D Artists, and QA to bring a feature from an idea on paper into reality within the game. Once the system is built a gameplay programmer supports iteration on that system when the system requires new features, needs bugs fixed, ect. Empowering and unblocking our teammates so that they can iterate fast, efficiently, and have the systems they need to build content is our top priority. I worked on Illaoi, Jhin, and some new champs on the Champion Team previously before moving to my current team where we are prototyping gameplay concepts for the future of League of Legends.\n8.) 10-6 or 7 is pretty standard\n9.) In high school I was lucky enough to have a fantastic programming teacher named Mr. Frisby. I went through C++ AP certification, Visual Basic Microsoft Certification, and my high school sent me on to take Java Programming and CISCO networking courses at a local technical college my Junior and Senior years. I went to the Milwaukee School of Engineering to study software engineering where my favorite courses were Operating Systems, Robot in a Box, Computer Security, and Modern Physics. My senior design project was a home brew game console with wireless controllers, multi core processor, always on dashboard, mp3 player, and custom games. I worked at EA Tiburon on Madden, Human Head Studios on Prey2 and unreleased titles, and BioWare on Dragon Age Inquisition and other titles.\n10.) I definitely would have gone to a public school, but that is pretty specific to my personal situation. I would have also studied 3D vector mathematics harder before my first game studio interview. I dipped into them briefly in a computer graphics course in college, but the applications are so different between rendering triangles in computer graphics and aiming explosive rockets in 3D space for gameplay.\n11.) There has never been more free professional game development tools! Its pretty exciting. As a student looking to get into making games there is an array of free game engines for you to begin learning and prototyping in. I would start building games as soon as possible. A finished game, no matter how small, is impressive to have on a resume. If you're interested in console / PC gaming then try to learn C++ and choose a game engine that allows you to practice those skills. If you're interested in mobile development learn Java / C# and play with Android's free SDK. Get comfortable with an IDE like Microsoft Visual Studio or Eclipse. Use a version control system like Git to store your project's progress in to become familiar with them. Learn your 3D math! :D","replies":[{"poster":"SofaKingHi420","date":"2016-04-15T14:39:14.316+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Awesome for replying and helping a student. \n\nI have a question that may or may not be offtopic. If you were starting the learning process from the beginning, with little more Knowledge of information systems than pushing the on button - What skill/Language/Book/information would you seek out first? What skill do you find is most helpful in your current position? If you were hiring an engineer for your team, what is the one skill that they would absolutely need to posses in order to be considered?","replies":[{"poster":"DizzyKa","date":"2016-04-15T23:49:30.330+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmm... that's a tough one. If I were starting the learning process of Programming specifically from the beginning what is the thing I would do first? I personally got into programming by tinkering. I got a copy of Visual Basic, downloaded a Borland C++ compiler and just started messing around by looking up keywords and examples of what I wanted to do online. Tinkering only got me so far though. My skillset was restricted to copy pasta'ing examples, changing something in that example to see what it would do and hitting compile. I didn't start beginning to develop real skills until I started taking directed programming courses at my high school, which I know aren't available in all high schools. \n\nSo if I knew what I do now, but had to start over I would know that dry textbooks would not be effective because they would bore me, so I'd need a goal to keep me grinding through the boring parts to achieve something. I'd set my sights on a simple game, because I'd want to write my own games - Hangman, Pong, Tic Tac Toe, choose something simple like that as my goal. I'd know that graphical representation is added complexity, so since I'm a beginner I'd program these games in text form ( In a command window a tic tac toe board for instance is ouput with english characters like |X||o| | and takes input from the command line ). Then, I'd choose a language to start with. I'd choose Java or C# since they have strong OOP concepts but lack the added complexity of memory management and pointers. Choosing a \"lighter\" language like Python might not set me up well for the type of programming I hope to do ( games ) even though it would be valuable if I eventually wanted to be a different type of programmer. I might choose Java because its very similar to C# and moving from Java to C# is in my opinion an easier conversion than from C# to Java BUT I know that the free Unity game engine uses C# for script and if I choose C# to learn then I could eventually move into using a game engine to hone my skills. I'll keep in the back of my mind that one day I need to learn C++, but wait until I have proper instruction to learn good fundamentals. Then I'll buy a \"gold standard\" reference book for the language I chose knowing it will be good to use from time to time, but internet searches will likely give me most of the information I want to find. \n\nMy favorite reference for C is \"The C Programming Language\" - https://read.amazon.com/kp/embed?asin=B009ZUZ9FW&preview=newtab&linkCode=kpe&ref_=cm_sw_r_kb_dp_NXxexb1FJXWB2\n\nMy favorite reference for Programming Patterns is \"Headfirst Design Patterns\" - https://read.amazon.com/kp/embed?asin=B00AA36RZY&preview=newtab&linkCode=kpe&ref_=cm_sw_r_kb_dp_4Yxexb0RDAQ9A\n\nI unfortunately don't have favorite books for C# or Java, but maybe another engineer could chime in and suggest something. Honestly, in this modern era of available information on the internet a reference book is probably not key to your development until you enter directed programming courses.\n\nSO. Wow, that was a long answer :D\n\nTLDR; I'd choose a simple game to make like Tic Tac Toe. I'd build it as a text game. I'd choose C# and download free Visual Studio to develop in. I'd start looking up examples of how to do input and output from the command line in C#. I'd start looking up examples of data structures like arrays in C#. I might even download an example of a tic tac toe game that someone else made and tinker around in the code they wrote to see what things do. Then I'd enroll in programming courses at my earliest opportunity!","replies":[{"poster":"DizzyKa","date":"2016-04-15T23:55:04.170+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"And to reply to the second question you had : \"What skill do you find is most helpful in your current position? If you were hiring an engineer for your team, what is the one skill that they would absolutely need to posses in order to be considered?\"\n\nA long time ago when I got my first internship and my engineering manager, Mickey, asked me to look for other students that would be good to hire she told me it doesn't matter what language they know because we can train that - what matters most is they have the ability to learn. I find that that has continued to be a truth as a programmer. The most important skill you can have is the ability to keep learning, a hungry curiosity to do so. Trends will change constantly - what types of languages and tech are popular, so if you sit on your laurels your skillset will quickly be obsolete. \n\nThe industry talks about \"T Shaped\" engineers a lot. I think the term was coined by Valve. What that means is that we like engineers who specialize deeply in one area ( animation maybe ) but are generalist enough that they can help out in most other areas. This is what makes an agile developer, and if you have the ability and drive to keep learning then you'll quickly become T shaped by virtue of these things alone.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ArlanKels","date":"2016-04-14T12:34:59.993+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=DizzyKa,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=G43hAV7A,comment-id=0012,timestamp=2016-04-14T01:29:27.461+0000)\n>\n> 1.)

Michael Ivey\n2. Bachelor of Arts, Religious Studies\n3. Riot Games\n4. I’m @ivey on Twitter, I usually notice mentions there\n5. I work in Service Availability, writing mostly HTTP services and automation systems.\n6. Senior Software Engineer\n7. I write code. As part of that, I also write tests and build scripts and documentation. I spend a good amount of time talking about what we are going to build, how it will interact with other systems. I also help other members of the team with build scripts and automation.\n8. I start around 8 am most days, from my phone: checking email, reading news, catching up on chat. I usually get to my desk around 10:00. We have a daily meeting in the afternoon, and I usually have another meeting or three. I spend a lot of my time talking to other folks on my team, or working directly with them on projects. I usually call it a day by 6:30 pm.\n9. I left High School early, went to Georgia State University and got a 4 year degree in 5 years. I studied Film & Video, Folklore, and eventually Religious Studies. I graduated and went straight to work as a sysadmin.\n10. I made some decisions around where I worked a few times that I suffered for - working for people who weren’t kind, or ethical, or for projects that were doomed from the beginning. Those jobs led me to where I am now, though, so I don’t think I would change anything.\n11. Don’t feel like the only path is CS degree then grad school. If you’re passionate about learning and can do stuff on your own, it’s possible to make your own path.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Riot IronyMoose","date":"2016-04-14T00:37:30.541+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"1.

I was a bit of a slacker, but I finished strong! My career has had ups and downs, but I wouldn't change much.\n11. Just write code, no matter what it is. Make games, websites, whatever you love, make more. If you want to be a serious coder, learn C++, and learn it well.

Riot values direct feedback between individuals from any discipline to any other discipline. If you have concerns about a new item, a concept, you're encouraged to give that feedback even if you're not on the same team. The Champion team for instance is structured in such a way that each small group that's assigned to build a champion can be involved in ideation ( brainstorming ) and the whole group is responsible for being aligned around and championing ( ayy! ) the concept that they land on in the end.  It also really depends on the type of work you're doing. If you're maintaining a system that already exists then there isn't really a lot of new stuff going on, you might be focused on making the system better or just adding quality of life features. Some engineers don't really like being involved in this process and are more interested in tech for tech's sake, some engineers love this stuff and find it essential to development!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"McKeifus","date":"2016-04-13T20:15:29.281+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rito plsssssssss hnnnggggg","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gated D Latch","date":"2016-04-13T16:51:17.159+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bump {{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"R2D20","date":"2016-04-13T15:59:12.188+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://zippy.gfycat.com/EasygoingFreshKingbird.webm\nyou have my upvote - for Rito to notice you~","replies":[]},{"poster":"Serika Zero","date":"2016-04-13T12:46:36.663+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":3,"body":"This is the kind of projects kids get in NA schools?\nIt sounds like being interrogated by the police, even worse than my social skills 0w0\n\nReally that's normal?\nIf so, I'm moving to US, it should be sooooo easy to deal with people then","replies":[]},{"poster":"Troll for Trump","date":"2016-04-13T06:24:33.996+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"CertainlyT lol","replies":[{"poster":"Zedex","date":"2016-04-13T11:59:34.824+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You did read the title right? _Software Engineer_, not champion designer.","replies":[]}]}]}
