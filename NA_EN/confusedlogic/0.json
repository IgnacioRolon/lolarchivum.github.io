As soon as I start a match, my entire computer freezes and I have to force shut down my  computer because even after waiting 30+ minutes, it was still frozen. I have tried multiple times, and even custom matches, and it still freezes. I decided to do a fresh and clean reinstall, and all that did was cause my computer to freeze faster. It also does not seem to be overheating. I have seen this problem on other posts, but none of them had answers, so help would be great.","replies":[{"poster":"Æ’unky p","date":"2016-09-12T05:45:30.660+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Disabled game bar and uninstalled Xbox app all together, I'll let ya know how it goes","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-11T21:11:39.835+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're running Windows 10, this could be related to the Anniversary update that has been rolling out for the last month.
