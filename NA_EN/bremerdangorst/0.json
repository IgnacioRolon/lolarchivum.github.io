But since the cycling is random, it'll probably take more than the Electrocute CD (25 seconds) to get another skill that's as impactful, unless you're somehow fighting constantly without killing each other, maybe Maokai vs. Zac.","replies":[{"poster":"7thHeaven","date":"2019-11-26T07:41:05.577+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aphelios","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pika Fox","date":"2019-11-26T19:41:49.872+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its good on anyone that can make use of multiple runes effectively, and doesnt need to specialize in any one.\n\nIllaoi and ezreal are the easy lists, as post buff it will likely be their best rune, as its already very close to being such.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Draehl","date":"2019-11-26T18:39:24.595+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is just way too much variance for this ever to be balanced.
