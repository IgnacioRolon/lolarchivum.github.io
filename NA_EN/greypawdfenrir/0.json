Now i'm worried that he is a repeat customer for years who has essentially lost all of his skins and champions that he has paid for and accumulated over the years... A little more information on how to solve this issue please? So far i am not seeing any real actions to take to resolve this problem when there is no phone number contacts or way of getting in contact with Riot directly other than Forums.\r\nAny info to resolve this would be appreciated.\r\n\r\n \r\nThanks,","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-19T04:44:29.006+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The best method of getting your friends account secured is to have him use the [**account recovery form**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=72416).
