You had a combination of poor decision making on his part coupled with just about every cooldown you could have on your end while he did not have those. If he had his ult like you, it's a different scenario.\n\nIn the end, your personal anecdote doesn't outweigh the general performance and dominance of the champion. When you give WW a heavy crutch like he had in your video, then sure, it's possible to, just barely, kite him. But most times, people don't have the luxury of having all their defensive cooldowns up while also having the help of a blast cone while having tower shots and a laner to come flank. Of course Warwick can be killed, and you've shown just that. But to use this video as \"evidence\" that Warwick can simply be kited is ignorant. If you came back with a montage of you kiting WW over and over consistently, then sure, but a single, stars-align scenario? It holds no merit. \n\nCloud drake, by the way, only works out of combat. So it helped him get to you, sure, although with diminished effect since movement speed has a soft cap. So once he got that first hit on you, that entire dragon is worthless. Also, if you look, most of the chase he did not have it. He had it for the briefest of a second after he landed on the other side of the bush from the blast cone. It's indicated by the misty white effect. So to imply that you somehow out kited this speed demon of a champion with his double cloud drake and passive is fairly misleading. The cloud drake was just about irrelevant. What was relevant is that you're citing that this champion can be kited under the scenario that you have all your cooldowns up and he does not. If you were to recreate this scenario under equal terms, being all cooldowns up, or at least equal cool downs, the Warwick would most likely tear you apart. \n\nThat's the realistic scenario most champions deal with. It's why Warwick is climbing in ban rate. I'm not saying you did a bad job in that clip, there's a reason you clipped it. I'd honestly wager most people without a firm grasp on Lux would have died there, so good on you. But don't try and use that clip to suggest that Warwick is easily kiteable. That's laughable at best. I'm sure there's clips out there of squishies kiting Akali or Zed's one shotting Ornns. Can it happen? Yes. Is it probable or even likely? No.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Gamer Gallade","date":"2018-02-24T08:19:01.681+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Warwick is broken but he doesn't need a hotfix.\n\nHe is not breaking the game as hard like the time when he was old Weedwick and abused the living hell out of {{item:1419}}\n\nRight now he is just over tuned and should be address but not instantly.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ZephyrDrake","date":"2018-02-23T23:25:31.960+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"oh look, the thing everyone does to make something look broken but you can apply it to literally any champion in the game even the weakest champions in the game which means that it's a completely pointless thing to do... do not list \"strengths\" or \"what changed\" without anything else since i can do that with champions like {{champion:9}} {{champion:266}} {{champion:236}} {{champion:133}} {{champion:50}} {{champion:84}} {{champion:240}} {{champion:203}}  and you would not even be able to determine who is actually broken and who isn't since just saying what a champion is good at or what changed about them in a positive way means very little in the grand scheme of things","replies":[{"poster":"buPPDrmXEO","date":"2018-02-23T23:28:55.090+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I did not even begin talking about what Warwick is good at, I've just stated what they buffed on him. \n\nThings that he didn't have at 50% win rate balanced state, and the things that he has now. \n\nThey improved every aspect of the champion that lead to him being at 56% win rate that he is now. \n\nWhen champions you listed reach 56% win rate, damn well you can go and complain about them being broken.","replies":[{"poster":"ZephyrDrake","date":"2018-02-23T23:30:48.157+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Juice,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=rffGgy1O,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2018-02-23T23:28:55.090+0000)\n>\n> I did not even begin talking about what Warwick is good at, I&#x27;ve just stated what they buffed on him. \n> \n> Things that he didn&#x27;t have at 50% win rate balanced state, and the things that he has now. \n> \n> They improved every aspect of the champion that lead to him being at 56% win rate that he is now. \n> \n> When champions you listed reach 56% win rate, damn well you can go and complain about them being broken.\n\n\"balanced champion\" yeah a champion that nobody cared about was a balanced champion... winrate literally is meaningless on its own but you can keep using it like it actually means something if you want","replies":[{"poster":"buPPDrmXEO","date":"2018-02-23T23:54:11.861+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yup, noone cares about balanced champions, people tend to play champions they see more success with (Overpowered or broken ones), you're right in a way. \n\nYour arguments are really bad, I think you should just stop.","replies":[{"poster":"ZephyrDrake","date":"2018-02-24T00:01:23.555+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Juice,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=rffGgy1O,comment-id=0002000000000000,timestamp=2018-02-23T23:54:11.861+0000)\n>\n> Yup, noone cares about balanced champions, people tend to play champions they see more success with (Overpowered or broken ones), you&#x27;re right in a way. \n> \n> Your arguments are really bad, I think you should just stop.\n\nas opposed to yours which is \"warwick was balanced\"... uhh... he was rarely picked and literally anything that you did too him would sent him in the \"too strong/too weak\" category so he was left to rot until the rework.

Win rate is not meaningless on its own. There are other factors, but if something its 56% win rate, there's no excuse. The whole, \"winrate doesn't mean everything\" is the argument used to not buff champs at 47-49% because playrate drives win rate down, so it could lead to an overbuff since the idea is that players new to a champion should be doing poorly while experienced players should be doing well. 47-49 is just under 50 so that means the vast majority that are novices aren't dragging the win rate down as much as they should since the mains are doing very well, hence the true power of a champion.\n\nBut 56%? On a high play rate champion? That means not only are mains doing well, novices are as well. The champion is a problem. There's no excuse for a 6% variance except in the rarest cases being a champion has such an abyssal play rate yet his mains are finding great success, so you cannot nerf that which isn't played. Think Karthus. Warwick though? High play rate, high win rate. Even without the play rate, unless he was pre rework yorick/galio/urgot level, that's an unacceptable number.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
