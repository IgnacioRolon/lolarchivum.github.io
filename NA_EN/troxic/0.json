There is a reason why this gameplay boards are nothing more than a meme to anyone with a brain.\nMages good, tanks good, assassins and wind man bad, armor useless,  here gimme upvotes tyty.\n\nIf we balance the game around what the people here complain about and what they don't the game would be even shittier than it already is.\n\nAnd I don't know where you pull your statistics from, but he definitely isn't 5% over Olaf in wr, not even close to it.\nHe has 48.84% according to op.gg in the last week.\n\nHe doesn't need a nerf.","replies":[{"poster":"Troxic","date":"2019-07-10T21:47:14.921+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Olaf win rate in silver 45.78%.
