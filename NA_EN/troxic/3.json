That person shouldn&#039;t be allowed to play the game ever again. \r\n\r\nI strongly believe that intentional trolling in ranked should be subject to zero tolerance policy. Not only should the offenders account be banned, any accounts associated with the same email should be banned and any accounts associated with any payment methods on his account should also be banned.\r\n\r\nThis should be very clearly explained in an update to the policy so that existing players and new players know what kind of behavoir in ranked is not tolerated.\r\n\r\nTo me, this is not excusable. I can understand flaming, being toxic, upset, having a bad match, disconnecting because life happens etc. But not this. This has no excuse and these people need to not be playing ranked.\r\n\r\nRiot, you claim that you read the boards. Well respond to this and tell me any good reason why this shouldn&#039;t be adopted as a policy.","replies":[{"poster":"DaFluffyPotato","date":"2017-12-11T06:15:00.678+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There isn't anything wrong with off-meta builds or picks.
