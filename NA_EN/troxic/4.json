I had 40 when he had 9. I had 90 when he had 45. Meanwhile, my entire team runs around like morons dying, starting bad fights, losing firs turret blood etc.\r\n\r\nSo I get criticized when my farm is low, even though the trade off is me roaming, objectives and assists and kills for other lanes. But if I just straight out farm the shit out of lane and stick to my lane hard, my moron team throws.","replies":[{"poster":"Baron Barian","date":"2017-12-12T07:07:41.216+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Play Nasus if you want to try that again.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Attticus Finch","date":"2017-12-12T06:35:27.513+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Correct, this is a team game.
