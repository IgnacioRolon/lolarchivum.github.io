There are countless clips and videos showing off how she literally misses everything but still kills people\n\nThis is one of the worst champions league has ever seen, I'm not talking about JUST current champs no, she is up there with pre rework Nidalee, pre rework Talon/LB/Kassadin, Win Nhao, perma stealth Eve with stun, Release TF, Release Thresh, Release Vlad.\n\nShe is the literal definition of what league should not be.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_QEUtWv-tM\n\nLOOK AT THIS SHIT!\nSAY HELLO TO OLD NIDALEE!\n\nSee a little similarity with Zoe m8?\nJust a LITTLE SIMILARITY?\n\nAt the least Nidalee had no good waveclear at that time.\nAlso look at the non-existant damage compared to today holy fucking shit, that Graves ult didn't even scratch Ezreal, that Shyvana would have died 5 times by todays league with that engage, that lee ult would have killed both of the guys he hit.\n\nhttps://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-410-notes\n\n> With her oppressively high spear damage and catlike (maybe just cat-ish) elusiveness, Nidalee's been a contentious low-risk, low-interaction champion for quite some time. Specifically, old Nidalee's gameplay often revolved around the question of \"when should I stop throwing spears?\" to which the answer was typically \"never.\"\n> \n> To that end, our goals with this Nidalee gameplay update are to tone down some of her many frustration points while also giving her more options other than chucking projectiles. We also saw this as a great opportunity to cement Nidalee as a real shapeshifting huntress, which meant stronger ties from her human form to her cougar form. Additionally, by connecting Nidalee's offense with cougar form, she now has to balance her high escape potential against her ability to hunt down squishy targets (\"Leap away or leap at their face?\"). There's certainly more counterplay (and teamplay for those playing around Nidalee engages) when a cougar goes flying into the backline versus a single nuclear-tipped spear\n\nHow much risk does Zoe have when throwing Q's? Absolutely fucking none since you TP back no matter what when you use ult.\nWhen should she stop using Q? Absolutely never\n\nSAME problem SAME design SAME frustrating playstyle.\nOther than the fact that Nid Q was single target (so you were kind of safe behind minions) and not AOE and she didn't have a 1500 range stun to secure the hit and she didn't actually one shot people, she just chunked them.\n\nOld Nidalee is a better designed champion than todays Zoe\nTell me a single argument why Zoe has the right to exist but old Nidalee doesn't.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Academy Kayn","date":"2018-08-05T20:50:08.830+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"Bruh learn to spell.
