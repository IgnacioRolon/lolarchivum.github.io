Pick trundle (pref in practice mode for quick recreation)\r\n2. Put enemy dummy under its turret, and ally dummies on the inner turret to draw enemy minion aggro. Wait for your minions to walk into tower range.\r\n3. Go into tower range, and knock up the enemy dummy with the pillar, and tower now has aggro on you. \r\n\r\nIt even puts a DPS &amp; Total count on the dummy when Trundle E only slows and knocks up the opponent.","replies":[{"poster":"DuskDaUmbreon","date":"2020-01-05T01:43:38.208+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I believe his pillar deals a single point of true damage.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2020-01-05T01:40:43.078+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This has happened on purpose for many years.
