It adds another extra level of uneeded randomness. Where grabbing the guaranteed drops early game can ruin your game. It ruins your game by forcing you to level up in the early game so that you see fewer level 1 units. So it's harder to level up anything and keep yourself from falling behind. It also ruins the hyperroll strat.","replies":[{"poster":"ElektroAEiids","date":"2019-07-15T18:58:43.115+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey but at least you will never die to Minions if you have already 3 Units 2nd Round!

They were going to add guaranteed items, but then they force you to level before you have time to hyper-roll???

If you're in that situation, it's literally better to receive ABSOLUTELY NOTHING (just barely worse than the single coin) than to have your strat ruined with a forced level.\n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}}","replies":[]}]}
