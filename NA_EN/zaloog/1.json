I literally am not able to play team builder since I get the error and am kicked from the group. It happens in the middle of team select so sometimes I cannot change my masteries, summoner spells,etc. There have been posts about this issue popping up since 2013 in some capacity and recent posts where riot staff doesn't even bother to respond. Yet it's still a problem I recently re installed the client 2 weeks ago, and before that I tried repairing the thing 3 times it does not fix the issue.  So please someone at Riot help me fix the problem, or even better start rebuilding the client, show people your actually doing something to fix this issue.","replies":[]}
