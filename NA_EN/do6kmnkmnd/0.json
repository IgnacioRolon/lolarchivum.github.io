A few hours later I discovered that it was migrated to a different server and that my bank account was zeroed out because whoever hacked it spent all of my money on RP. I am concerned because I haven't even gotten an initial reply asking for account details. Since I submitted 2 tickets does that mean I have to wait longer? I am already upset because it was hacked two days before the ranked season ended and I was extremely close to getting to Gold, so how much longer do I have to wait (and not have my money)? I understand this happens to a lot of people but I feel like this case should take priority above many others. Whoever stole my account is definitely still using it and can do a whole lot more damage before Riot does anything. Please help.\r\n(This is not the account that was hacked)","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-10T06:00:45.177+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It *really sucks* to lose your account, so I know it doesn't feel good with every hour passing by. We get *a lot of tickets*, especially at the end of a ranked season. We deal with tickets on a first-come-first-served basis, so while your issue is really rough, we have to address the tickets that were submitted before yours. \n\nWe'll be able to sort this out together, but we're gonna need you to hold on for a bit longer until we can get back to you in your ticket. Let me know if you have any other questions.","replies":[{"poster":"DO6KmnkmNd","date":"2016-11-10T06:34:53.588+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can't log in to view my ticket or anything because the account is obviously not in my control. I just have no idea what I am supposed to expect in terms of a reply to my ticket because of this. Is it an email I should receive? If so, did I delay it by submitting 2 requests using the same email? I just need to know when I can expect something because I have no money available until this is worked out to me since I had to shut down my credit card. Thanks for the quick response!","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-10T21:59:28.453+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"So with account recoveries, your entire correspondence with our support team will be via email. I honestly cannot estimate exactly when you'll get a reply since our ticket queues are quite high due to the end of season. I can assure you that our teams are working their butts off and will get back to you as soon as possible.\n\nI really wish I had more details for you, but I hope this clarified things a bit more for you.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
