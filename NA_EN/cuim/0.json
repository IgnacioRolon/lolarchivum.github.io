I&#039;ve been playing League of Legends since season 1, and i think this game is amazing and that Riot is doing a great job with it in general.\r\nWhen Aatrox was created, like everyone else, i got very hyped for the champion cause of the thematic of a godly warrior, that would change the course of wars, consequently changing history (to a correct direction, maybe). Although that feeling was not very well accomplished in game, the champion was kinda playable at that time.\r\nWith time passing by, mechanics got modernized, champions got reworks, and Aatrox (along with other champions) became outdated.\r\nRiot did a good thing with most of the reworks. Although some champions aren&#039;t played too much, they got new mechanics and became unique.\r\nAatrox on the other hand was a bit abandoned, and became probably the worst champion in the game since maybe season 4 or 5. I could understand that because there was a lot of champions that needed some work, but why didn&#039;t the champion even receive a buff or a small change??\r\nMeanwhile we get to season 7 and finally Riot starts to seem to give some attention to Aatrox. Then they release a mini rework to this champion, while promising that the champion would get a big rework probably coming after Evelynn, and maybe in the beginning of the next season.\r\nThe rework was awfully bad, it just made the champion even worst and more unplayable, and it seems Riot continues to ignore the error they have made.\r\nNow with the new Road Map Champion post, once again Riot spits on this champion putting it in last priority again for rework...\r\nSwain already got a mini rework, Irelia needs some changes for a long time, but its still a playable champion that can go well in top lane. Aatrox is in a completely bad shape! It is extremely hard to have impact with the champion...\r\nI would like Riot, to please review their priorities in the rework plans, and start to put more work on Aatrox or at least to revert all the changes they&#039;ve made or give some mini changes to the champions to at least become a bit more playable. I understand that they already said it&#039;s going to be the biggest rework, but they have already been promising big changes for the champion for a long time, and they keep delaying them...\r\nPost {{champion:266}} if you agree.","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-10-18T15:29:44.400+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Considering how often these changes are coming out and how long the changes actually take to create, the Swain and Irelia changes are probably already way too far in development to change the order, changing the order now would more or less mean patches without changes rather than Aatrox coming sooner, they probably each have their own team working on them so changing the order wouldn't even make him come out faster.","replies":[{"poster":"Cuim","date":"2017-10-19T18:19:44.865+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's true, but i feel that it's a bit unfair, when they had already talked about changing the champion a long time ago, and they keep delaying it. It seems they don't even have any ideas. So it seems that they are not working enough on the champion which is a bad thing since he is probably the one who needs it more","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-10-19T20:01:55.451+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't believe they have said anything about delaying it, just that it was down the road. They never said \"We will have it done by X date.\" to my knowledge.\n\nAnd the issue was probably that they didn't have any ideas for him. It is hard to define what makes a character like Aatrox special and then keep that and make the game work. If you asked me, someone who barely knows him, I would say what makes him special is having built in sustain on autos. It is almost impossible to balance something like that though, and it doesn't exactly make sense for a demon (darkin) to have that identity anyway, and his lore doesn't really allude to it either.\n\nSo they have to decide whether to take him in a direction that his lore takes him (he shows up, inspires a losing army, and then turns the tides of the battle), his appearance (a powerful, dominating demon type character), or in the direction that his current gameplay takes him (a drain tank with a built in res).\n\nBut it isn't really just about choosing, it is about picking the one that the players are attached to, won't shake the mains up too much, and that gives them the design space to make him unique and able to be balanced. If they rush it then you end up with a screwed up champ all over again, and even with all of this time and resources put into it, it still might not meet expectations when it comes out.\n\nSo yeah, it has taken them a while.","replies":[{"poster":"Cuim","date":"2017-10-19T23:39:57.126+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually they have been talking about the champions in some posts for 1 or 2 years if i'm not mistaken, but you got me with your argument.\nI agree with you, it's probably better for them to take theire time to decide what's the best direction to take, and to do something really good, instead of doing something fast but that will be awfully accomplished, like the mini-rework they have made.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Sisyphean Smile","date":"2017-10-18T23:32:26.468+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:266}}","replies":[{"poster":"Cuim","date":"2017-10-19T18:20:28.683+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"thanks for the support friend.
