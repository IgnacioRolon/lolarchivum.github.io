That seems to be the standard answer. Though I've heard that low elo and higher elo are vastly different in what champions are strong/weak.

Kindred takes a lot of practice inorder to play right, you need a very good knowledge of the game and a team that knows how to peel for you. I wouldn't recommend kindred for lower elo, even when she was broken, now she's kinda garb everywhere but has a little success from kindred mains in higher ratings. \n\nKha and Rengo are good. I wouldn't say they suck higher elo, pink wards don't screw them that much considering they're about getting on a target and one shotting, kha in particular doesn't use his stealth for anything more than jukes and passive resets. Rengar may have hard ganks but only like 30% of the time a higher elo player is holding a pink ward for your ultimate and you can tab to see if its worth your time. \n\nOnly other junglers I can really say are very good right now and easy to pick up in lower elo is{{champion:32}} {{champion:106}} {{champion:154}} {{champion:72}} {{champion:9}} {{champion:28}} \n\nSome others like {{champion:60}} {{champion:76}} {{champion:68}} {{champion:10}} {{champion:104}} are great also but have a different playstyle and skillcap that might be hard to get used to.","replies":[{"poster":"Sworeclipse","date":"2016-09-18T22:03:13.528+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks so much!!!

After doing a combo you'll naturally do it and the jungle clearing will get easier (first clear is hell for new kha'zix players, watch a vid). Whether or not you see success will be as you experiment with what champions you can duel, catch out, what fights you can jump backline in, etc. Thats just player knowledge rather than kha being mechanically tough. He's only tough if you're trying to do some really crazy diamond E assist resets that are nearly unpredictable, and even thats not needed for success. \n\nRengo is the one with a lot of mechanics despite him looking like a press R champ. Every ability has a second ability based on a consumable meter. \n\nGeneral assassin gameplay is just not picking the wrong fights and not diving 1v5. Kha is a 1v1 champion and his Q passive increases damage to targets in a 1v1 scenario.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Roit Gums","date":"2016-09-18T21:38:56.898+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Graves and Khazix are god tier","replies":[{"poster":"Sworeclipse","date":"2016-09-18T21:47:08.224+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh ok, I'm not very interested in graves but I am in kha zix.
