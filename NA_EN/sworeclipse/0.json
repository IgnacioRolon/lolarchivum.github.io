It's because it's only for NA and my account is on EUW. Can a riot employee give me back the rp? I can show the gift card code for proof.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-16T00:00:17.624+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"RP cards are specific to the region it was intended for so, an NA card won't work for EUW.  Reach out to us in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new), and our billing team can take a look.
