I run at a steady 116 FPS and use a GEForce 1060 that I recently just bought. Before I got my 1060, I used a 460 and never had this problem. Despite this correlation, I think that the issue is with some software not the hardware switch. I tried uninstalling a bunch of programs that might have been doing weird stuff (any free antivirus stuff) and a PlaysTv program to record my games. \r\n\r\nDo you have any suggestions on what can fix my problem. I'll add any necessary info about my software.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-09T20:50:26.836+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since you just recently upgraded to this card, that fps drop might be caused by an outdated driver.
