Tech Bugsplat problem","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello, i have just changed from a relatively small monitor to a 24 inch monitor. I have started playing other games and now want to try out league of legends on this monitor. Whenever i join a game though, it bugsplats for me, i try to reconnect and it keeps bugsplatting each time. I can go through the champion selection process but whenever the game starts a bugsplat occurs, can anyone help me?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-03T23:32:10.493+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you so much for providing all the context you have on this issue. What's most likely happening is when you're loading into the match, it's trying to use your old display resolution, which probably isn't the same one you're running now. We should be able to resolve this by completing a reset of the input file saved server-side. First, you'll want to **log into the game** then hop into your config folder, which should be in the following directory:\n\n>**C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config**\n\nDelete these two files from inside this folder:\n**- input.ini\n- PersistedSettings.json**\n\nOnce you've deleted those files, try hopping into a custom match alone to confirm the reset went through properly. Let me know if this worked for you!","replies":[]},{"poster":"PythonArms","date":"2016-12-31T08:28:59.341+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can't get into a game either. \n\nSpecific Problem: After champion select (on any game mode), the timer counts down to zero and the game tries to switch from the launcher to the game. It crashes and gives me a bug splat error. It puts me back to the launcher with the reconnect button. When I press reconnect, it does the exact same thing with the same bugsplat.\n\nThings I have tried: \n- Clean windows boot \n- older graphic card drivers \n- updating DirectX \n- update Java \n- compatibility mode \n- run as administrator \n- turning off firewall \n- turning off anti-virus \n- uninstalling/reinstalling LoL and cleaning the registry \n- repairing LoL through launcher\n\nNone of these things in any combination seem to get me into a game. I have leaverbuster now from the ARAM games I was trying to play, so I switched to custom games to try and troubleshoot but still not luck. Any advice would be appreciated. I'm at my wits end here.\n\n**EDIT/UPDATE** This worked for me: http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/X6sPFPu8-fps-drops-and-crashes-after-the-windows-10-anniversary-update","replies":[]}]}
