The most common one is that a lot of players have the \"Close Client During Game\" option enabled in the Client Options.  This causes the entire client to go into a deep sleep in the background when you play and may not always re-appear. Make sure that option is disabled.\n\nBeyond that, it may as strange as it sounds, be a connection issue.  Whenever you enter a game of League, the client leaves itself in a hibernation type mode until the game ends.  Sometimes, some computers will simply kill the connection if it sits idle too long.  The steps in our [Connection Issues Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664) should be able to help out with that!\n\nIf it is still doing that, regardless of the steps you've taken, feel free to hit me back up!","replies":[]}]}
