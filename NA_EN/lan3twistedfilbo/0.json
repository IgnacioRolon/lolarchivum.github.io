Like the background of it to where its blurry and you cant click anything outside, that&#039;s whats showing there after closing these things. Also does it when changing summoners.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-01-13T23:05:08.627+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hiya! \n\nThanks for the report!
