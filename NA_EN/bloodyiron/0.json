I had to run on all low settings to get 85FPS in battle, which is very smooth and I can play ranked like that. If I turned everything to max (except vsync) I would get about 50FPS, enough to make playing ranked painful, ugh.\r\n\r\nI&#039;ve tried a few builds, but didn&#039;t really see any gains... until today.\r\n\r\nI switched to 1.9.2-staging-LOL3, making sure to check CSMT is on, and wow it is night and day.\r\n\r\n* all low settings, in combat, I now get 150-210+ FPS\r\n* all high settings except vsync (AA on), in combat, I now get 135-160+ FPS\r\n\r\nI&#039;m on a GTX 960.\r\n\r\nSo what&#039;s the lesson? USE THE NEW BUILD IT&#039;S RAD!","replies":[]}
