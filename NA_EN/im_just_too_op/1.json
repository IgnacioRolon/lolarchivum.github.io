Right now, im posting this from **[REDACTED]** account. \nOn LCU, I have my **[REDACTED]** id as login. But is it possible for you guys to make my **[REDACTED]**, i.e. the account im posting from, viable on LCU?

Let me know about it.\nThanks\nIm just too OP","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-18T23:03:48.331+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We can't transfer LCU access between accounts, unfortunately.
