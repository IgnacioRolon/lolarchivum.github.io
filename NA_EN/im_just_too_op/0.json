I strongly recommend you simply save your RP for a later date to partially pay for some skin you really want that has just been released or placed on sale.\n\nAlmost all players end up with a surplus of chests in the long run as key drop rates are incredibly low.\n\nEven if you somehow had a surplus of keys and no way to gain more chests, 125 RP could only really earn you 1/3 of a mystery skin which are already of dubious quality. And it could very easily amount to less than that.","replies":[{"poster":"Im just too OP","date":"2016-05-12T16:35:53.157+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know. But i rly dont buy Rp.

I'm not joking when I say you should never, ever buy them.","replies":[{"poster":"Im just too OP","date":"2016-05-12T20:22:20.496+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know.
