I was thinking what is your plan on the next champion skin? I was thinking of maybe heimerdinger and Vi. Heimi, bocoz well its been a long time since he got a skin, I believe. And Vi becoz well, http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/Fgps23E2-jade-dragon-vi?comment=000000000001 this is so epic. Pls do leave your feedback! means a lot to me!","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-06-22T16:12:21.715+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hiya - \n\nUnfortunately, we don't announce what's coming down the line for skins, just what's on PBE for the current patch. Stuff shuffles around internally, and sometimes, an idea just doesn't work out. We don't wanna tell you we're making Pretty Pretty Princess Urgot and then have it not work out. :P Clearly, Star Guardian Urgot is the right call here, and something I will be proudly suggesting once he has his rework. \n\nIt's been quite a bit since Heimer's last skin, I think he's a good candidate for something. Less so on Vi, because she received Demon Vi fairly recently. \n\nI've seen the idea of Jade Dragon Vi, and I do like the concept. It'd fit in really well with Lunar Revel, imo. ^-^","replies":[{"poster":"Im just too OP","date":"2016-06-23T22:46:37.269+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How much is fairly recently? Is it like 8-10 months? Becoz Vi got her skin in nov 2p15 i believe. And i agree, Star Guardian Urgot is the right call and the only call there should be that has no arguments.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-06-24T20:43:27.185+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Somewhere around that ballpark, yeah. We try to space skins out, but occasionally, you'll see skins a bit closer closer together due to thematics/events. \n\nI agree - Star Guardian Urgot is the only option here.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Aerothal","date":"2016-06-22T16:43:37.189+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i see you guys learned from the PFE experience :D","replies":[]}]}]}
