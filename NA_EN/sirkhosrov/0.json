An unstable connection can cause your client to not properly connect to a match and in some cases, it can crash your client entirely. Our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) will address the most common solutions for this issue. \n\nBecause disconnections negatively impact everyone in the match, regardless of the reason for the disconnection, [the system](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ) treats all disconnections equally. This is one of the reasons why penalties cannot be modified or removed. \n\nIf you still encounter issues with disconnections after working through the guide, please let me know.","replies":[]}]}
