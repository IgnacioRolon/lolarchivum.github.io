And I have an MSI GE72 Apache Pro, so my machine is no whimp. But recently no matter what I do I cannot get league to exceed 60 fps, it even feels like it's sluggish, I've reinstalled, repaired, did compatibility checks, and the like but nothing. My machine runs other games just fine and has a breeze doing so so I don't know what to do. I am running Windows 10.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-11T02:08:06.193+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Some recent Windows 10 updates pushed a new feature out to the Windows Game Bar called *Game DVR*.
