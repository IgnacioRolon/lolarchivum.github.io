And I have a few choice opinions and words to get out there, seeing as how most of them say that it&#039;s more a troll item than anything on her.\n\nIt. Is. _Devastating._ You can still build tanky if you need to, and yes it is a more damage-oriented style for her, as well as more of a late-game strategy, but that&#039;s one of her gameplay options. She doesn&#039;t have to specifically be a bruiser or a tank. Yes her passive on her W does a lot of damage on its own even without the player needing to build any damage. Yes with her E it seems somewhat redundant to get Devourer on her.\n{{champion:254}} \nTruth is, Vi is a very powerful champion either way. Whether you play her well or not honestly, she&#039;s in the meta right now and some of you don&#039;t even know it.\nAnyway, let&#039;s get on with the discussion and the stats.\n\nWarrior first. Yes, it&#039;s a good item on her for early game damage and control. Especially now with its buff with 60 AD and 10% CD reduction. {{item:1412}} This can be a very effective item, yes. If you need the early advantage whether your team is behind or you want to try to stomp early. With that item, you can build defensively and still have damage behind your blows, even not getting much attack speed. Problem is, you&#039;re not going to survive much unless you can just straight up do more damage than your opponent(s). Which brings in the tanky build from earlier.\n\nWhich brings up Cinderhulk. Yes, its health and health scaling can be _very_ effective in a tank build if your team is squishy. That with Ninja Tabi or Mercury Treads can be a great way to start off as a beefy, more supportive and lock-down style of support... jungle... hybrid thing. But it will _drastically_ reduce the amount of damage you&#039;ll be able to do.\n\nNow there&#039;s a choice to be made on which jungle item you&#039;ll _actually_ get. Whether it&#039;s the Sabre, the Knife, or the Blade.\n{{item:3715}}  {{item:3711}}  {{item:3706}} \nAll three have different bonuses. The Sabre gives you bonus damage when you smite a champion, making it powerfully effective on both Warrior and Devourer. The Knife is good for Cinderhulk because it&#039;ll give you the warding and more supportive edge and provide more vision on your map. The Blade is good on any of them, and a well-rounded item for whichever you want to use, whether you go Warrior, Devourer OR Cinderhulk, because of the slow on the smite.\n_nobody talks about Runeglaive..._\nBut let&#039;s talk about Devourer for a while.\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}} \nYes, it does take a while to get it sated. Your team _will_ need to be able to keep itself sustained and able without you for a while. But it&#039;s not game-breaking. If anything will be, it&#039;ll be your Devourer buff. The main problem everyone seems to be talking about with the Devourer method is actually farming enough to get it sated. Thing is, you don&#039;t need to seclude yourself to the jungle to rush its ending buff and get it powerful ASAP. That&#039;s the problem some people see too often with Vi&#039;s in the jungle trying Devourer. Yes you can rush it, but honestly she&#039;s too powerful of a ganker and bruiser to _not_ gank even though she has Devourer stacking.\nAnd I will admit that one of the weaknesses or counters is plainly counter-jungling. If she can&#039;t kill the big monsters and get that stacking going, then she&#039;s not going to be having a good time. That&#039;s truly the only weakness to her when she wants to get Devourer stacked and get the power advantage overall.\n\nNow the good thing about Devourer compared to the others is the attack speed and bonus damage on hit. After Devourer, it&#039;s highly recommended that you get a Blade of the Ruined King. {{item:3153}} The power of this item is magnified with the Devourer because of the attack speed of both items combined. _Not to mention her W passive._ \n\nIt is one of the most powerful combinations you can think of in mid to late game, and you can still build all the tank you want. The power of this build is in the fact that it takes just those two items to do everything you want damage wise. After those, you can build as much tank as you could dream. Spirit Visage or Banshee&#039;s Veil, and Randuin&#039;s Omen, Sunfire Cape, or even Deadman&#039;s Plate can be added to that with Ninja Tabi or Mercury Treads depending on the team you&#039;re facing. The last item you need since you have 5 now, (those being Devourer of your choice, BotRK, boots, and two of either above for armor and MR) can be either another tank item such as Warmog&#039;s Armor or Guardian Angel. Or if you&#039;re feeling safe enough as is, you can go for the BM and go for Black Cleaver or Titanic Hydra, since both are powerful in both health and damage, and the Black Cleaver has bonus armor penetration to go along with your W passive. And since you have the attack bonus of Sated Devourer, you&#039;re going to be attacking really quickly, doing a ton of percentage health damage with each second attack going with your W passive and the BotRK.\n\nIf you want my honest opinion, the people that say that Devourer is weak on Vi compared to the early/mid game bullying of Warrior or Cinderhulk. I say they&#039;re right in one regard; the early game. But the late game falls incredibly short compared to the destruction and survival potential of the Devourer path.\n\nNow that&#039;s the items dealt with. Let&#039;s move to runes and masteries. Since those are powerful, especially now. People always push for you to get Attack Speed runes of some sort with at least 12% AS. Sometimes even 15% for jungling.\n\nI want to tell you that if you want to go Devourer, you don&#039;t need that bonus attack speed, and I can show you what I use instead. I&#039;ve already told you that you have plenty enough attack speed with Devourer and BotRK alone.\n\nhttp://puu.sh/lmsPA/d4f127c7a0.png\nArmor Seals and Quintessences, Armor Pen Marks, then scaling MR Glyphs. (you can also use AD marks, but opinion is opinion)\nThat&#039;s my rune page when I play Vi using any of the jungling items, or even going top lane with her and not getting a jungle item at all, and instead getting another damage or tank item, or just since I don&#039;t have the jungle item, I go with Black Cleaver _and_ Titanic Hydra. Getting both when going top lane can be very effective.\n\nAs far as the masteries go...\nhttp://puu.sh/lmtrd/d5d3f0727c.png\nYou can do it in a more offensive way... (image was supposed to be Fervor of Battle, not Warlord's Bloodlust. And puush broke so can't get a new one rn)\nhttp://puu.sh/lmtoK/8bba2369d6.png\nOr more of a defensive way. Depends on how you want to play.\n\nThis is what my build generally looks like, with branching patterns, and in no particular order.\neither boots{{item:3111}} {{item:3068}} {{item:3156}}  any MR or armor will work\n{{item:3931}} {{item:3153}} {{item:3047}} {{item:3143}} {{item:3102}} {{item:3026}} or even {{item:3071}} \nOr dmg or healing {{item:3742}} {{item:3065}} {{item:3083}} or even {{item:3748}} \n\nThat&#039;s one of the most prime build paths when going Devourer on Vi. You&#039;re still incredibly tanky, you hit like a truck with the speed of time-skip Luffy and your only weakness is that it takes a while to get there because you need the Devourer to get sated. _Which means do Dragon and get Scuttle Crabs as many times as you can. Dragon especially. It&#039;ll boost you and your entire team hard._\n\nYou can test this on your own in normals or customs with friends, or you can add me on League and see how I do it.\nSummoner name: phyziKal\n\nVote on the poll below on which jungle item you prefer on Vi after testing out my method a few times. Just not in ranked at first.","replies":[{"poster":"GetMariahCarried","date":"2015-11-23T23:39:38.605+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cinder may SEEM like it screws her damage, but keep in mind, it's a great synergizer for cleaver + titanic builds. When you're running near 5k health on Vi, punching people for 500 physical on the titanic active, and you're still doing a beastly amount of sustain damage at anywhere from 230-300 ad, depending on what else you bought, and you STILL have over 150 armor and mr, you can be quite overpowering, no warrior or attack speed items needed. Grasp of the undying will give you somewhere between 120-150 extra damage and heal as well, which is pretty bawler.\n\nNote though, I recommend this build more from a late-S5 perspective, which is when I last played Vi jungle a lot. The few times I played her a couple weeks ago in pre-season with this same setup, if I recall correctly, I'd still have pretty strong kda's, but I just couldn't bring the same amount of threat to the other team lategame. When you have a Graves that can crit pretty much anyone to death in 4 hits, it makes juggernaut Vi seem a little underwhelming.\n\nI should probably try Devourer and Bork again S6. I had a few terrifying lategames with those combos in S5, but in general, it always seem to be weak on Vi, who already has percent max health physical damage that only scales in impact with ad, arpen, and cdr, and in some ways more so than attack speed. You'll probably say \"ewe, S6 bork\" but come on, that 2% less isn't THAT big a deal.\n\nP.S. Awwwwweee yyiiiihhh flat armor jungle quints. Still doesn't touch  my jungle taric setup: flat armor quints and marks, scaling armor seals. Puts me at 21 flat + 27 scaling, for a total of 48 lategame.

This season though, you need more of that without the low-level cdr mastery. There also was always a toss-up between using lifesteal quints for super-sustain early and sacrificing mr glyphs for more scaling cdr quints, or keep traditional glyphs and sacrificising early sustain for scaling cdr quints instead. Really don't know how I'd approach this route in full these days with the new masteries, jungle items, and pots. Haven't spent enough time trying out different things.\n\nI'm guessing Vi tests are next on my teambuilder spam list. {{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}} \n\n\nP.S.

On sej for instance, you don't really need move speed or damage items against an enemy when you can ram a boar into their bum repeatedly, every time they gain the slightest distance from you. Doesn't work out that way though without the cdr though.\n\nThen again, cdr may not be so important if you're in a lot of fights with outcomes decided in only a few seconds, which does happen a lot.\n\nIn any case: \\*cue obligatory Vimoticon\\* {{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"GetMariahCarried","date":"2015-11-24T00:36:44.747+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"P.S. on another note, tiamat early was much stronger on Vi in S5.
