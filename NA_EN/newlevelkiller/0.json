I managed to do so and everything would be fine but there is one thing that i can't find anything about it. My summoner (latrix lvl30 eune) seems to be separated to my account and instead i have this (newlevelkiller lvl5 na). I don't see anything about switching summoners, if it is possible and how. Can anybody tell me what has happened to my account?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-27T00:59:46.647+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We're unable to address account-specific issues like this here on *H&S*.

I thought summoner is always one and permanently locked to main account, now I wonder what could change this situation. I didn't find any official informations about it so I will just suppose that it is your technical failure.","replies":[]}]}]}
