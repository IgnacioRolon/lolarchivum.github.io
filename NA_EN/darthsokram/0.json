I enjoy the way the rewards system works and that people toxic get punished it is very normal. As many people also me i have been toxic and i accept my punishment to honor demotion lvl although it was so easy to get demoted to lvl0 honor it is absolutely terribly hard to get back up i have been lvl0 honor for 3 months now and i got honors in this time and still im lvl0 and also while other people have many friends to play with and gets honor from them all the time and reach lvl5 for us that we dont really play with friends and dont get so easily honor we have to try really hard and still people decide to give it somewhere else probably to their friends so in that logic i will need a year just to reach lvl1 and i really believe this is terrible because spending most of my time in this game this keeps me away and also makes me hopeless thinking why to play i never gonna get not even to lvl2 honor and is dissapointing. \r\n\r\nThank you for your time and i know its normal what you do but doesnt mean we gonna like it {{champion:17}}","replies":[{"poster":"Aneirin","date":"2018-07-16T21:53:28.313+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Honour from friends counts for almost nothing - you're better off honouring and getting honoured from randoms anyway.","replies":[{"poster":"Bazerka","date":"2018-07-16T21:59:46.425+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":6,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Aneirin,realm=OCE,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=EH1nGEnY,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-07-16T21:53:28.313+0000)\n>\n> Honour from friends counts for almost nothing - you&#x27;re better off honouring and getting honoured from randoms anyway.\n\nYou sure about that?","replies":[{"poster":"xHades","date":"2018-07-16T22:27:18.177+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Can I game the system and boost to level 5 by constantly playing with a premade and honoring each other every game?\n\nNice idea.

Unfortunately the alternative is to write something like \"have you checked in on that? I cant confirm the numbers behind it, but i'd encourage you take a look at that and your experience to confirm because I believe that answer is wrong no offense.\". While I certainly can write like that, for me it feels really stiff and lifeless. It feels safe :(. I'd rather be genuine and honest and run the small risk of being read incorrectly than sacrifice all empathy in my communication style to be politically correct.
