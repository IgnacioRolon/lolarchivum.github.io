When I play other games like destiny 2 with some friends for hours on end no issues. It happens often like every other game pretty much. I have a OCZ - ModXStream Pro 700 W 80+ Certified Semi-modular ATX Power Supply so idk if that can be causing it and my video card is a RX 580 4gb so I don't think that's the problem but I can be wrong. Like I mentioned before if I play any other game no issues whatsoever but tft it's like clockwork. Has anyone been having these issues and knows ways to fix this?","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-07-22T01:32:53.541+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kernel Power Error just means power was cut off because the system crashed, not always because of an issue with the power supply. That PSU is ancient (in PSU terms) and of questionable quality, but it is probably not involved.\n\nSince it is not the fullscreen freeze bug a lot of people are having, chances are it is a stability issue with your system. Probably not an issue with a part crashing under load, since TFT is not exactly intensive. It could be a driver issue or the gamemode using certain memory addresses/instructions that are not commonly used by your other programs.\n\nDoes it happen at any specific point or screen, or is it random?","replies":[{"poster":"krazyxd","date":"2019-07-22T01:39:19.385+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for the quick reply. It happens somewhat random I think but mostly during the early stages of the game. I played one game this morning and it didn't happen but just played 2 games and it happened both games. The first game happened during creep round I think it was during either the 1st round or 2nd so very early. The second time it happened during the early pvp rounds probably 2 or 3 round after the initial pve rounds.","replies":[]}]}]}
