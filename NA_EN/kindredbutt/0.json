It said he was for 440 Riot points but after getting him I lost the full 880 not the 440. I already used my refunds and was wondering if I can get help with this.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-02-18T06:51:07.623+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Galleni,\n\nFor something like this, it's best to [submit a ticket(https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new)] to Player Support.

In the top right corner in Blue writing should be the word \"Support\"\n\nClick on that.\n\nYou'll open a new page, on the top right there will be three options. The first of those three options will be \"submit a request\" - click there.\n\nThis should open the request page, select in the dropdown box \"I have a question about League of Legends / Riot Games\"\n\nFill in the boxes on this page. Under the \"category\" section, click on \"Billing and Store\" then it will change to a new menu and click on \"RP Purchase Errors\". \n\nHope that's clear ;)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"KindredButt","date":"2015-02-18T05:54:50.193+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay, thanks","replies":[]}]}]}
