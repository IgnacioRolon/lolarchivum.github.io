When I got into the game I noticed something **very crucial**...I had no idea what the heck I was doing. The _TFT mode_ honestly just puts you straight into the game with no help at all. This made the game super frustrating for me, no controls were explained at all. I had to actually go search up guidelines myself which didn't seem right at all. I feel that the League staff should put in like a tutorial to appeal to newcomers that want to come, and that way they will then know how to play right away.\n\nWhen I first started I had no clue that you could just right click on a character to see their class and name. I thought you had to memorise it all which made it even more frustrating. I only found out about the right click after I lost a game and searched everywhere for guidelines.\n\nAm I the only one that thinks there should be a tutorial or even just some tips in the game when you go to play it? **Every other game shows you the ropes of it so why doesn't this one?**","replies":[{"poster":"Porglit","date":"2019-08-05T14:17:40.938+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"When I first started playing, I spent numerous games putting people on the board, looking at all the synergies I had, pulling one off, comparing with the synergies I used to have to see what was gained/lost, and writing it down for each character.\n\nThen I realized you could right-click for info.{{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}}","replies":[{"poster":"KingHavik","date":"2019-08-06T10:57:58.444+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"RIGHT?! I did the same thing...until I searched up for help on the game lol. Then when I found out the right click I felt so stupid","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ryan here","date":"2019-08-05T08:41:57.933+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"For some reason though I think Riot want you to go to the twitch/youtube influencers for help. Also because the game was so rushed development wise they probably haven't had time to work on a tutorial.","replies":[{"poster":"KingHavik","date":"2019-08-06T11:01:49.927+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If they want us to go to influencers to gain knowledge on the game then they aren't using their brains much. People don't always watch others to get experience on the game, especially when they first get into the game. I am subscribed to loads of people on Youtube and none of them play League lol. So this is a terrible way of doing things. Even just implanting little tip bars everywhere would help, and having an option to turn them off if you want to. Going into a game blindly is a terrible way to play and is how you make people turn away from your games. It's a shame that they rushed through it so much that they didn't even think of inputting anything like that.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"WoonStruck","date":"2019-08-06T11:09:37.461+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"You won't find any in-game because Riot actually sucks as a company. Their priorities are entirely wrong at this point to where you should honestly be disincentivized from playing the game, however there are great resources all over if you wish to learn it anyway. \n","replies":[{"poster":"KingHavik","date":"2019-08-11T08:38:13.409+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ya I looked up quite a few guidelines from Google and got some good results. I'm not too shabby at the game now and know what I am doing. :)","replies":[]}]}]}
