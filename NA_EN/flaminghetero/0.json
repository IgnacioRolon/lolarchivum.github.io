Yoricks, Urgots, and Galios. But every morning I awaken and to no avail, it is filled with the same champions over and over again. LeBlancs teleporting through the fields. Jarvan flags lay strewn across the map, and Graves' bullets bursting with intensity. Nary do I see anything new, creative and fun. \nBut what is this new mode? Is this a joke set forth for the first of April or can it be true? U.R.F. Mode is released. A mode made just for fun. Surely this will ease my champion selection melancholy. The field will be brimming with unconventional champions.\nI wake up and play and all is well. But after a sparse number of games I find league still has the same problem. While the champions are now different, their frequency stays the same. The rift rumbles with the sounds of Sona. it is left darkened by the shadows of Zed, and terrified by the nefarious jester Shaco. There is no room for cannons of Gangplank. The field is to hot for the ice arrows of Ashe, and to barren for Zyra's plants. I go to sleep again dreaming of the eccentric champions that never see the light of day. Perhaps I will try the forgotten lands of dominion, maybe there is some creativity and fun being had there.","replies":[]}
