She approaches operations with controlled and calculated measures, almost never losing her cool. As an ADC, she'd be very defensive for her role, allowing the enemy to come to her before springing her trap.\n\nPassive: Espionage: When out of combat for more than five seconds, the Major can move through minions and remain undetected by them\n\nQ: Passive: When standing still for two seconds, Motoko gains armor penetration. Active: Seburo Burst: The Major flips to full auto, increasing her attack speed for several seconds.\n\nW(1): Tactical Cloak: The Major cloaks for five seconds and prepares to line up the perfect shot. For three seconds afterwards, Motoko gains 20% bonus damage.\n\nW(2): Cyborg Assault: The Major makes a large, inhuman leap to begin her assault. For several seconds after she lands, Motoko gains 20% bonus damage.\n\nE: HV Rounds: The Major loads High Velocity ammo into her Seburo SMG and opens fire on the enemy. Every second of sustained fire pushes her back one Teemo. She is immobile during this time unless the skill is ended early, and her aim follows the mouse. Enemies hit by projectiles are slowed 5% for two seconds, and the effect stacks with each successive hit. When the stacks reach 50%, the target is stunned for 1 second. Scales with attack speed.\n\nR: Brainjack: The Major uses her Wizard-class hacking skills to their fullest extent. The target champion receives enormous damage and is slowed. If there are nearby enemy champions, the target only receives half, but begins attacking their allies for several seconds, and are briefly rendered immune to crowd control, buffs and heals.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Solaxo","date":"2015-02-10T08:57:12.842+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"How can a native english speaker confuse \"you're\" with \"your\" is beyond me.","replies":[{"poster":"ChimeiTekinaNasu","date":"2015-02-10T17:17:59.961+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Solaxo,realm=EUNE,application-id=Ir7ZrJjF,discussion-id=FO1dkNry,comment-id=0028,timestamp=2015-02-10T08:57:12.842+0000)\n>\n> How can a native english speaker confuse \"you're\" with \"your\" is beyond me.\n\nlol.

At the same time, he's a brute and a hothead that can withstand a world of punishment. His fighting style is highly adaptive, but unrefined, so his abilities would not focus too much around being clever or highbrow; like Trundle, his greatest strength would be to hit something until it doesn't work. Despite his thuggish attitude, Kuwabara is extremely goofy and softhearted, and his spirit powers are closely tied to his emotions, so he should be encouraged to fight around teammates. No real good ideas here.\n\nPassive: Knight in Shining Armor: Kuwabara cares for his friends and gains power from their presence. Kuwabara gains 5 armor, magic resist, and his base healing is increased by 15% for each nearby ally.
