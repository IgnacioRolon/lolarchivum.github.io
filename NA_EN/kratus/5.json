What happened is about 3 weeks ago I was called for an interview, the human resource manager interviewed me and when the interview finished he thought I was over qualified for the position he interviewed me for and offered me a different position with way more pay. He told me to PLEASE wait a week so that he could call me in for my information and get it done, then he gave me his card with his company phone number and company email to contact him just in case. \n\nThe week passed and he didn&#039;t reach me, so I tried contacting him and he wouldn&#039;t pick up. I also tried sending him an email and he didn&#039;t reply to it either. Few hours later I get an email from Macy&#039;s for an interview and to schedule myself. What I was thinking is that the guy reaching me out again, when I get there no one is where they are supposed to be working. Office is closed in work hours and then I tried reaching one of the people on the floor and they got me with someone who interviewed me for a position and funny story because this guy also thought I was overqualified for this different position so he offers me another one on the spot. I tell him that the human resource manager already interviewed me and that he offered me a position. Then the guy tried to get a hold of the person but he said to give him a couple of hours so he can find out what&#039;s going on. Hours pass and I call and then the guy tells me to wait 5 more days because he won&#039;t be able to find out in the moment. \n\nDays passed and he didn&#039;t call me so I called back. To then the guy telling me to wait 2 hours because a lady from human resource was going to clock in. I then call and get put on hold. Lady then tells me thank you for interest in Macy&#039;s but all positions are filled. I tell her, are you kidding? I explain to her the situation and then she bluntly replies that all the positions in the store are filled. I tell her that I can see on the website the positions open and she just stays quiet and then repeats the same thing and that I should&#039;ve gotten an email. I didn&#039;t get the email so I said okay thanks and I tried reaching corporate. As I try to reach corporate because she clearly was no help and I&#039;m already frustrated the number is just a bot that doesn&#039;t help. I called different numbers to then get transfer to a supposed specialist that happened to be the bot again. I called again and talked to someone and he said he wouldn&#039;t be able to help. I call the lady back and I tell her that I need to speak with the guy who interviewed me first. She tells me to give her my number and that he will call me on Monday. I tell her that I don&#039;t mean to disrespect but will he actually call and she said yes and if he doesn&#039;t to call back.\n\nWhat actions do I take against this? My time has clearly been wasted by this company being unprofessional. I was guaranteed a position that then supposedly every position just got filled. What do I do? Can I take legal actions against the company?\nI was thinking that if he calls this Monday to ask to give me the number of his supervisor.","replies":[]}
