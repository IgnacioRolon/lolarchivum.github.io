Followed up by a *this is why rito sucks as a company and atoD 2 is better*\r\n\r\nMost of them are stuck in Bronze or Silver. Some rare times you&#039;ll see one of them in Platinum. But if you do see them in Platinum they spend more time in the forums talking about how much Riot as a company sucks rather than playing the game.\r\n\r\nThey will often come to be seen as the &quot;unique players&quot;. Addressing LoL jokes and the weebs as cancer. Okay, weebs are pretty weird. But if you think about it this game is pretty much more anime than cartoonish. So since they hate LoL they also have to hate anything that looks slightly animated. Dota 2 is 100% cartoonish so you can see my point there.\r\n\r\nThey come from their game to spread hate and cancer to our community. If anything they should be addressed as Gabe&#039;s witnesses.\r\n\r\nHave to shove their love for Gabe&#039;s down your throat. Then be toxic about every joke ever created in here. \r\n\r\nLeague of Legends is like our great nation United States. We are the greatest nation :v (OPINION)\r\nDota 2 is like ISIS. They want to hate on everything United States has and instead of making the place they live in better they got to come here to be salty about us pushing them around in their country. Get a taste of freedom you fuckers.\r\n\r\nYou can see in the link I posted as my previous thread got down voted by Dota 2 lovers who are mad about League of Legends being 4x more successful than Dota 2.\r\n\r\nGo to your own forums and play your own game. Why do you got to come to our forums to spread your hate for animated looking things and edgy jokes?\r\nWe like it and we are happy about it. You&#039;re just pissed because we are happy about it. So you got to make us feel bad about what we have. Pretty sure that&#039;s called jealousy.\r\n\r\nYour game is so much better than ours.(your opinion) Go ahead and play it. Why are you wasting your time here in League of Legends forums spreading hate and toxicity?\r\n\r\nGo on now and play your game that is so much better. Also use your own forums. \r\n\r\nWe don&#039;t want you here.\r\nWe don&#039;t want to hear the word of your lord and savior Gabe Newell.\r\nWe don&#039;t want to hear how much you hate animated things.\r\nWe don&#039;t want to hear how you think our jokes are cancer.\r\nWe don&#039;t want to play your game. (I actually play it :v but I&#039;m talking for the one&#039;s who mainly just play LoL)\r\n \r\nSincerely, \r\nMe and League of Legends community.","replies":[]}
