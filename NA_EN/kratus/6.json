{"poster":"kratus","date":"2015-04-27T15:39:05.051+0000","title":"Goku vs Madara","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] General Discussion","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"Now I know there will be this wild dbz c*** rider who will just say. \"lel goku will just destroy the wold gg\"\n\nLet's make this battle actually good. \nFirst: Goku isn't the type of person  capable of destroying a world. He is a good guy who would never hurt innocent people. So saying he will 1 shot the Naruverse is out.\nSecond: Madara can just make Goku literally brain dead with a gengutsu. Now I know there will be this guy who comes out of nowhere saying that gengutsu doesn't affect Goku because he doesn't have chakra. But when you make 2 characters from different universes fight, you literally have to forget about that logic and just let them use everything on each other. Because obviously they use different abilities and just limiting the ability of one character just seems unfair. \nThird: Now let's just say you are RIGHT. Gengutsu doesn't work because he doesn't have chakra. W.E. Madara still wins and let me tell you why. Because since you want to use that logic. Then I can just tell you that the sage of the six path body CAN'T be affected by ANYTHING except red chakra and sage chakra. Meaning every single ability Goku throws at Madara won't work. That's very specified in the manga. Only sage chakra and red chakra can pierce the body of a god. That god being the son of Kaguya. \nForth: You might think there's NO WAY IN HELL Madara has an ability strong enough to hurt Goku. Because if he can fight against world destroyers then he will surely not be affected by someone who can just destroy a country. Well that's true... Madara CAN'T hurt Goku at all. But so can't Goku to Madara since like I told you. Only red chakra and sage chakra can pierce the body of a god (the god from the naruverse). But Madara wins by the simple fact he can just seal Goku. Madara knows almost every jutsu ever created and how to counter it. So his sealing ability is advance enough. He is not someone who lacks the ability of sealing. He can seal very well. Now he can just seal Goku away. Meaning Goku has no way of killing Madara or affecting his body in any way. But Madara has an ability to just grab his soul and capture it. \n\nMadara wins against Goku. \n\nP.s if one of you comes saying that Goku is extremely fast and can't be catched I shall note that Madara outplayed the second hokage and fourth. Now they aren't near as fast as Goku. But if they have a seal on you then the are a billion times faster. Because teleporting isn't speed. Teleporting is instant. Meaning is faster than the speed of light. Because it isn't speed. It's just instant. So if Madara could outplay both of them being blinded or with one eye. Surely Goku won't be near fast enough to do anything on him that he won't counter and just seal him.\n\nMadara>Goku confirmed.\nBtw I have used actual logic from both sides. I didn't make anything up. Everything about his body only being affected by sage chakra can be read on the manga. Even if I give Goku prep time and he becomes a sage. Then that will mean he has chakra now and he can be under a gengutsu. So nothing Goku does can win against Madara.\n\nLeave your thoughts below :D\n\nEDIT: Please show actual facts as to why Goku wins. It's also a 1v1 so don't say Vegeta randomly appears and combine forces XD \nI can seriously already feel the DBZ fanboys downvoting this thread for being proved wrong as to why their characters aren't that OP as they think they are. cri\n\nI will list here 3 of the most powerful ways a soul can be stolen with no way of Goku to counter.\nhttp://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Absorption_Soul_Technique\n\nhttp://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Soul%E2%80%93Body_Separation_Technique\n\nhttp://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Forbidden_Secret_Technique:_Reaper_Death_Seal!\n\nOnly way for those seals to be stopped is if someone stops them before they are completed. But this is a 1on1 between Madara and Goku. Not Madara vs Goku and his amazing friends lol","replies":[]}
