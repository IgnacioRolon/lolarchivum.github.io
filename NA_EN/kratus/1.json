PLus im sure im starting to come near the 3 thousand game mark is well. so no this site does not give you a good answer.\njust saw it only shows ranked hours so 104 hours iv done in ranked it doesnt show your normal games\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"kratus","date":"2017-04-04T06:09:29.796+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Popular website https://wol.gg/stats/na/donaldjtahm/  does it for you. It probably just reads api of how many games you played and averages it.

You can see some of your stats like how many ARAM games you've played or how many champions you've killed on Summoner's Rift. \n\nI don't believe one of the stats we track is time spent in game, but you can get a nice estimation by assuming each Summoner's Rift match takes an average of 30 minutes. Multiply that by the number of games you've played and you'll have a good estimate!","replies":[]},{"poster":"FlashingThunder","date":"2018-03-09T21:36:39.362+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=kratus,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=sEq44Afm,comment-id=,timestamp=2017-04-01T01:57:58.855+0000)\n>\n> I&amp;#039;m so interested in finding out if I have done a 1000 hours.","replies":[]}]}
