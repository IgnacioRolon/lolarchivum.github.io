I understand that it might &#039;motivate&#039; users to pay RP for champs that they don&#039;t own during sale time, but it seems mildly unfair; If I already converted a set sum of money into a microtransaction currency I should be able to use that currency in the manner that I desire.","replies":[{"poster":"SGT Dingle Berry","date":"2016-11-20T00:26:17.915+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"From a business standpoint I get it but yeah I feel the same way, knowing I'll inevitably buy every champ means I'd like access to legacy skins when available. I could always drop the RP for the champ but prefer to use IP and may not be playing a specific role at that time and the hypothetical champ might collect dust for months.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sukishoo","date":"2016-11-20T00:57:58.837+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"Why would you buy something for someone you don't own?
