That can also add to your total cs but I'm curious how much it compares to killing minions. If your lane some how happens to get pushed against your favor accidentally you can always go for these.  There's also an option if your shove your lane to deny cs to your opponent. In this case I wonder how to properly way options of roaming, farming the jungle, or going back to buy. Roaming doesn't always work out and is risky. Buying is the safest bet and if done at the right time can increase your power. Farming the jungle camps is pretty safe but I'm curious is it really worth the time especially at the earlier levels when depending on your champion it isn't the easiest to do and may consume health/mana.","replies":[]},{"poster":"cwleungaa","date":"2014-10-14T20:03:37.806+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thank you for let me know that why I always miss the CS under the turret.\n\nthere's a different way between range and melee minions!!!\n\nGood post!!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sammander","date":"2014-10-14T15:54:08.145+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"+1","replies":[]},{"poster":"TenSlashTen","date":"2014-10-16T21:30:48.115+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"if riot gets me under 70 ping\n\\I'll get an average of 280+ cs a game\nUntil then Imma just play janna and press Q cause riots lag kills me.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JakeIsAFox","date":"2015-07-09T08:46:31.766+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm tired of these lame posts trying to tell you to cs better, yea the first 10 minutes are important if no one is fighting because **YOU CAN'T KILL ANYONE,** so what do you do instead? Farm it up! Tell me what the point of trying to farm an extra 20 cs is rather than trying to crush your lane?  Yea, it's 1 more kill than them but guess what if your lane's even, IT'S EVEN: FIX IT. Here's why you end up with more cs, past the 5-10 minute mark: Fear, they fear you and will not dare to push past where their closest tower is (or was >:D); and if you're consistently pushed it means you want to get ganked and because you're so far ahead because they fear you, they try to help with that gank. Well guess what happens next: you double kill the enemy bot lane because counter ganks and cleaning up is better than diving them under tower, and jungler runs away as if he just baited his bot lane into feeding... because he did. Crush your lane then crush the jungler, then crush them 5v5. Oh hey look i have 100 cs more than my laner and 10 kills up!\n\nIf you're not trying to kill your laner, are you even playing to win?

Try last hitting when the minion is **as low as possible**. This will ensure that you will get the minion. Also watch your minion auto attacks, because sometimes those screw up your last hitting. If there are two low minions but one isn't getting attacked by minions, hit the other one because the one that isn't being attacked will not die and you will not miss it. Try to find out the damage minions do so you'll know to last hit after how many minion autos. Ranged minions do more damage and Melee minions do less but are tankier. Therefore, to freeze a lane, kill the melee minions first, to push a lane, kill the ranged minions first so they don't have as much damage kill your minions.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"F0BPRO","date":"2014-10-16T03:39:00.602+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://league-of-legends-skins.tk/?rf=fSxtJrHnqg.GM","replies":[]},{"poster":"moststronger00","date":"2014-10-16T11:32:55.466+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"I'm just want to riven will be the free champion","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wasted Smurf","date":"2014-10-16T20:09:07.806+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"I don't need to practice csing, I'm already gold","replies":[]},{"poster":"A Retarded Clown","date":"2014-10-14T03:45:26.231+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":15,"body":"play dota 2","replies":[]},{"poster":"2yordles1cupcake","date":"2014-10-13T21:23:24.589+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":36,"body":"Want to learn how to cs like a pro? \n\nGo play dota 2.","replies":[{"poster":"FF1224","date":"2014-10-13T21:35:10.202+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":8,"body":"> Want to learn how to cs like a pro? \n> \n> Go play dota 2.\n\nConfirmed.
