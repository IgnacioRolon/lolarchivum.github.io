America is a mixed country, adding this could help alot. And as a user of Japanese Voice Pack, I had used up many times to search up, download Voice pack and putting them in the game. because every time the game updates, it will reset the voices. So why don&#039;t Roit take the time and come up with a **Voice Change Option** to make the player all around the world happy?","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-04-05T00:32:15.994+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Change the config file and set it to read only.
