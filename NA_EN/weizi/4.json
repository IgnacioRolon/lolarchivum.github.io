For armor items, there&#039;s Frozen Heart or Iceborn Gauntlet, this is good against 2 - 5 AD based enemies. However, sometimes you run into team with 4 - 5 AP and you want to get Magic Resist items but need to max your CDR too, then you realized that all the Magic Resist items are all only 10% CDR. Is there a solution for this?","replies":[]}
