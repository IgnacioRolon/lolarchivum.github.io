Luckily there was a jungle main and didn't swap with him because he really wanted to play top lane that particular game, but at least, I was able to talk him into giving the auto fill jungler tips throughout the game.\n\nOut of curiosity, what would you do if you were the support in my game? I was playing Leona, and the auto filled Lucian was 5/1. However, due to not being an ADC main, he was positioning badly and keep getting caught or sometimes gets zoned out of fights and not doing any damage. We had a 0/10 renekton, so we didn't really have much of a tank and I sometimes have to try to engage instead. Should I had just tried to not engage or only ult engage and then stay with Lucian the whole game instead?\n\nWe had:\nLucian(fed)\nLeona(me)\nAhri(fed)\nRenekton(0/10 -> 4/13 at the end of the game)\nMundo(fed)\n\nThey had:\nVayne(lost lane but ended out out scaling all of us)\nThresh\nCassiopia(fed)\nGragus(doing decent)\nSion(doing below average)\n\nHowever, they basically just outscaled us and destroyed us...\n\nCould you had been able to give him insight on how to position in team fights?","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-09-03T06:44:34.498+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I cant say what i would have done preciously unless i was actually myself doing it, but prob try to assist the lucian into getting into position before we fought assuming we were the one engaging(also assuming he's willing to listen to suggestions)\n\nBut i would more than like use my entire protective time spent with the ahri as she seems the most reliable according to what you've said, and if the lucian popped off well in the fight then that's a bonus.\n\n\nbut yea, i would make ahri the priority protections and lucian the secondary incase something goes awry, and if lucian died too head to mundo and help him.\n\n\nNow if you're the main engage and have to leave your carries alone for abit it's mainly trying to get lucian in position and hoping he can figure out the rest.\n\n\nAlthough it is unfortunate yall couldn't get it figured out before casso/vayne outscaled everyone","replies":[]}]}]}]}
