And my idiot friends wonder why I can&#039;t get an account past level 30 without getting banned. Every single game all 4 of my team members feed, flame each other, run it down, or go AFK/leave the game, and I am expected to be okay with it. Oh yea sure I report all 4 teammates every game because of their actions but I think we all know what good that&#039;s going to do. I&#039;m going to start submitting tickets for every single teammate I ever get because there&#039;s not one of them who&#039;s a decent human being.","replies":[{"poster":"DragonShea","date":"2019-01-02T09:12:51.410+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's not just the game but also people's attitude.
