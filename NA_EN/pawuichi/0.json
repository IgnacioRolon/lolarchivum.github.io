It would just turn grayish and won&#039;t let me click on it.\r\n\r\nIt probably has something to do with a ward skin shard from Hextech Crafting that I got a while ago, that had a weird name, something between the lines of &quot;ward_loot_that_bugs_your_client_Kappa.&quot;\r\n\r\nIs it a know bug that its getting fixed with the new client? I hope not, cause I feel scammed rn xD\r\n\r\nI&#039;ve seen some posts about it, but I don&#039;t think its getting the attention it deserves.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-08-15T18:36:38.340+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We're aware of an issue where some ward skins don't appear or prevent the ward skin selection box from appearing.
