Clearly my internet provider (optus) was f***ing up as i couldn't even access cellular data on  my phone. I played well and my team eventually won but even tho there is a WIN in my history i still lost 18 LP to a WIN. This is illogical and the leaver buster system really needs to be reworked.","replies":[{"poster":"El Sexo Goato","date":"2016-02-09T22:19:17.195+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That would require Riot to not focus solely on competitive play.
