Do you even know what juggernaut is? If we wanted to play my way, we'd go Darius...you say this, as if he's the ONLY one with this playstyle, when there's probably a dozen, maybe two dozen, champions who play like this.\n\nI agree ADC's shouldn't be able to gun people down without recourse. Trust me, I hate ADC role more than any other-as a bruiser AKA juggernaut player, I also know it's not MY job to reach them. That's for divers and assassins, and some artillery mages to do. If I am able to reach the backline, while also being tanky, while also putting out immense damage, where is my weakness?\n\nAs for the poking, even if he's poked, his regen is literally up there with Garen-better early game given Garen has to wait 7 seconds to have it kick in. \n\nNow, I'm not trying to say *EVERY* ranged champion has problems. There will be a few with very, very long range poke that can stay out of his poke and farm. But given there's like, 3 champions that truly have a good winrate against him in lane, statistically he's a very strong laner, with great teamfight potential. Again, he gets backline access by utilizing a frontliner with his ult, followed by his E to pull them to him. It's a bit unconventional, but it's worked for me multiple times, and his statistics seem to back this as well.\n\nI'm not trying to make him weak, but he is in fact in the same class as Darius-Juggernaut. As such he should have the same job-slow, very durable, high damage threat. He moves slow, but has that potential backline access most champions simply don't get.\n\nIt's not as bad 1 vs 1 as far as access goes since you do have to get close for the initial grab, so don't confuse this please-I'm referring to team fights.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Crescent Dusk","date":"2020-01-26T22:50:14.486+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Vectros,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=fwy7ywQE,comment-id=00000001,timestamp=2020-01-26T22:03:52.901+0000)\n>\n> I'd argue beating down frontlines with most of his kit is fine if that's supposed to be his thing, like Trundle, but shouldn't get backline access.

Sett has 2 viable options for 20% CDR, potentially 3 with how overbuffed FH is this patch, and easy access to 10% items in quick order.","replies":[{"poster":"Salty Mc Feed","date":"2020-01-28T12:39:38.633+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Did you actually just say that Trinity Force is expensive but Lucidity boots is bad even though the other boots are more expensive and then you suggest Frozen Heart of all inefficient items you could possibly buy on a manaless champion?
