I was juts wondering if it was something I did. Does riot not like events thrown by there community members? Im just a little puzzled at this point. Thanks\n\nAnd if i come of sounding like a bitch well..

But I definitely wasn't trying to imply YOU yourself were ignoring me since I know where you usually post at, if it was taken that way my apologies. I just thought I'd catch you while I could on this side of the boards since your pretty much the only Rioter I ever see post.  \n\nAnd about the whole Twitter thing, I haven't used social media in over 5 years so I have no clue whats going on out there other than these boards xD So i really appreciate you bringing that to light and I super appreciate your support <3","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Roasted Sigurd","date":"2015-06-22T22:10:47.492+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the reply! :D\nI play for a similar reason, to play with friends who live near and far. I often play league with someone who lives just down the road from me, but I also play just as often with someone who lives in Virginia, ~1,000 miles away. That's one awesome thing about this game, how one can connect with others easily.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nameless Voice","date":"2015-06-22T23:09:38.777+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"League of Legends.\n\nYou become addicted to it, and feel compelled to play because you remember the fun you've had in some of your previous games.\n\nYou go through champion select and feel the joy of starting a new game, bright and optimistic towards the future.  You have your favourite champion, the setup looks good, you are doing well.\nThen, the inevitable descent.  You realise you're stuck in a game full of players trying to make you as miserable as possible; you own team abuse and harass each other, the enemy team is made up of all the champions you hate playing against.  You struggle through it all, and maybe even win the game, but you realise that the flamers and the frustrating champions sapped all the fun and joy of your achievement before you even got there.\n\nBut then, a little time passes, and you think maybe the next game will be better.  Maybe your team will stay friendly. Maybe the enemy team won't be filled with those champions you hate.  Maybe it will be one of those rare games decided by skill and fair matchups in an atmosphere of sportsmanship, and you'll feel that magic you once felt when you were newer to the game.\n\nAnd so, you press on, press the SoloQ button once again, and the cycle continues.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TeemoJenkins","date":"2015-06-22T22:12:21.719+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:17}} Because my Lord and Master Teemo Commands it.  {{champion:17}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rueian","date":"2015-06-22T22:44:45.436+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I really dont know anymore...
