That is to say, the more a champion is played, the lower their overall win rate becomes. This can be due to factors like less experience, less effective builds, inefficient itemization, wrong masteries, and so on.... Basically the more a champion is played there are expected to be those with less experience who typically win less.\r\n\r\nOf course Ahri mains will argue and whine for days about how their waifu is the hardest, most challenging, and underpowered mid in the game. We will hear them whine for days about Syndra, Talon, Zed, or Leblanc.... Talking about how X needs nerfs or how Y is so broken... \r\n\r\nI'm speaking here for a purely objective point of view, in that numbers in themselves never lie. Ahri is the only champion in the game to maintain an absurdly high win rate of 54% despite being the most played mid in the game at all elos. And unlike champions like Talon, Zed, or Leblanc, her win rate doesn't still stays above 50% even after games have gone on for 40+ minutes. Her win rate is even higher during shorter games where these other assassins and combo mages are supposed to shine, and yet her win rate is still higher than theirs is for the given game duration. \r\n\r\nAhri mains please downvote this thread I really don't care.

As in, some champions are allowed to have 60+% winrates as long as only the 125+ game players are the ones winning that much. The real problem is when new players win too much.\n\nWhat the OP fails to realize is that *Ahri has been extremely popular since Season 2*. A gigantic portion of Ahri's players are dedicated \"mains\" that have hundreds of games on her. And it's not like Ahri has had many real changes in core gameplay in all these years, so all of that experience carries over season to season.\n\nhttp://champion.gg/champion/Ahri/Middle\n\n41% of Ahri players have **200+** games with her. These players are *expected* to have 55+% winrates. That's how champion mastery works and many other champions have far more excessive winrates for dedicated mains. 19% of Ahri players have 150-200 games and should likewise have very high winrates. And a further 18% have 100-150 games and should at least be over 50% on her.\n\nOnly 21% of Ahri players have fewer than 100 games on her, and only 6% have less than 50. The real issue is that these groups are the ones with a very high winrate.\n\nThe issue isn't that \"Ahri is just too powerful, please nerf\". The real issue is that Ahri is clearly a little too easy for new players. Her winrate is fine since she has a godly number of 200+ game players, but some of her power needs to be shifted into something more difficult so the newer players don't have so easy a time.\n\nI recommend lowering or removing the MS on her Q and putting power back into her E, possibly the damage amp that used to be there.","replies":[{"poster":"Eedat","date":"2017-04-13T17:31:57.711+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"Are you nuts?

Then all you can do is stick to your turret and dodge even more Q's, hoping your jungle will actually react before she hits level 6.

I'm just going to Copy-pasta the same ~~essay~~ post I used for the last one of these. \n\nIf we're only looking at Stats, that makes sense. But also look at how Syndra's graph flows (A immobile mage)\n\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/179c39b8ae44c8553fae84691b689a80.png\n\nShe peaks surprisingly high during early game. That's probably due to a lot of Syndra's getting ahead early, and snowballing the game into an early win. Then, she dips into sub 50% for 20-40 minutes of the game. This is likely due to a Syndra who isn't ahead/behind heading into Mid-game without any snowball to back her up. After that, she spikes back up to 52-53% as the game hits real late game. This would account for Syndra's who didn't snowball the game into an early win, but stuck it through the mid-game, and is now full build like everyone else.\n\nNow that makes sense for a non-ahead Syndra to be at a dip in winrate come middle game. She's an immoble Mage, who requires on bursting a Target to survive. If she isn't ahead of people, she's going to be at a disadvantage. This is where Ahri is different.\n\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/5900e672b512b084204a9cae9cbb2915.png\n\nAhri doesn't have the snowbally spike as Syndra has early game, as it seems most of an Ahri players wins end as surrenders, which is understandable, as players are more likely to dodge an Ahri charm than a Syndra stun. However, because of her Mobility, her win-rate does not drop Mid-game as Syndra's would if she's made it into mid game not ahead. That is where the difference lies, in the champions themself. A champion who requires burst to survive vs. a champion who needs mobility to survive, the mobility one is going to have a better mid-game, as she isn't going to get caught as easily as a Syndra would.\n\nIt's because of that key difference that Ahri doesn't exactly dip as hard as other mages do. An Ahri that isn't ahead, but stays alive not giving the enemy gold, is going to heighten the Teams chance of winning, simply because she isn't giving an enemy gold. As her team has a better chance of winning, so does she.\n\nFinally, I want to ask you this. This is Zed's historic average winrate and his average banrate. Even when at sub-50%, he sees pretty consistent bans. This is probably due to how frustrating Zed can be a times.\n\n https://i.gyazo.com/d6de08f75acbfa7be16a4e6a7e9cef23.png\n\nBut here is Ahri's Winrate and Ban rate averages.\n\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/0af3e5dca73a470b0c2ab4c598e1ab7d.png?noredirect\n\nHere, despite her being at a +50% winrate for a good amount of years, the only time Ahri has ever seen high-mass banrates, is when she was recently reworked, and was kinda broken as fuck. However, after several nerfs to damage, mana costs, and a later Passive sustain nerf, she drops back down to low ban-rates.\n\nIt's obvious that people don't feel frustrated about Ahri, even if she does have +50% winrates. The only time she's seen high banrates is when she truly became a frustrating champion. If Ahri is so strong, why aren't people getting frustrated against playing her and banning her more?\n\nThis is what I mean by you can't look at stats alone. You have to analyze why the numbers mean what they do, not just the numbers themselves.","replies":[{"poster":"ChargeItDownMid","date":"2017-04-12T22:09:52.915+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":17,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Anidan","date":"2017-04-12T23:13:18.957+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Can I just point out that when you carry with you the belief that something was OP but wasn't considered OP when compared to contemporary OP champions then that means that you can say that absolutely anyone was OP but nobody noticed it because there were still stronger champions?

Another reason being that she is anti early snowball because of how easily she can escape ganks if she is at the halfway point down midlane. Since its hard to snowball off her, its harder for the enemy team to farm kills and gold off of her.\n\nShe is a generalist as well. regardless of the meta, there is a part of her kit that will do well. She has good mobility and poke so she will always be good in a poke meta, though she will never be as good at poking as a lux or xerath, or as mobile as a kassadin or fizz. She shares the strengths of both champion types, but is not as good at a certain playstyle as a more dedicated champion to the class. Same with tank metas, she is good at kiting tanks and has low cd's to keep throwing abilities out. Sure true damage is there but imo its only a noticeable difference if its against a champion with high resistances but low hp, since tanks have a balance between hp and resistances its not very noticeable.\n\nAll of Ahri's natural mains have been nerfed almost to the ground. LB is pretty bad, and swain is more of a top laner now. The only real matchups that pose to be any sort of counter are fizz, orianna (and thats a stretch), katarina, vlad and yasuo (depending on the yasuo). Most of these \"counters\" aren't even good counters, they are just able to either clear waves or force pressure (that is inherent on a champion like kat or yasuo). The one thing about ahri though is that she has some of the same counterplay as vayne, where aoe can really screw ahri over. half of Ahri's kit requires you to get in auto range to use, her E and Ult damage. The other half is all skillshots and pick abilities.\n\nI think another big variable for ALL champions winrates is the huge flavor of the month problem that NA has. People tend to chose their champions based off of the meta rather than how good they are at them. This works both ways so I don't think this is a very strong point, but it is worth mentioning.\n\nOne thing I can promise you for sure, it doesn't matter if Riot nerfs Ahri, her mains will always manage to make her winrate super high. They can remove her Q ms, increase her ult cd, lower her W damage all that stuff and I can say for certain that she will always have a super high winrate and that is just because of how many mains she has, and how dedicated they are.","replies":[{"poster":"DarthFantasia","date":"2017-04-14T01:21:08.902+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not sure where you are getting the fact that she has the most mains from, that would be Lee Sin. It is impossible to be able to tell who has the most mains. She doesn't have that much poke; she is a highly mobile assassin. By no means is Ahri a generalist. She can farm well, gank well, assassinate targets quickly, and stays relevant the entire match. When you are amazing at everything and have now real weaknesses, something is gonna need to change. I agree that she has no real counters, which is another issue with her. A champion with no lane counters... Enough said.","replies":[{"poster":"Jeanne fan club","date":"2017-04-14T12:43:12.355+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Before they changed Champion.gg there used to be a section that broke down the distribution of games played. from this graph you could see how many players have x# of games. Ahri had always had about 70% of her players with 50+ games. She had one of the highest avg games played per player at about 90 for a champion of her playrate. with that information and her playrate, it can only be concluded that she has the most mains out of any mid champion. \n\nIll be honest, I didn't get to look at lee sins player distribution by # of games so you may be correct. I think we can both agree that Ahri is more straight forward and reliable to play than Leesin\n\n> By no means is Ahri a generalist. She can farm well, gank well, assassinate targets quickly, and stays relevant the entire match\n\nthis is what a generalist is... She fills many roles, so she will stay relevant regardless of the meta. \n\nAnd I know its a meme at this point, but real counters in lane don't exist anyway. Sure you can get to the point where its like a fizz vs tf in lane, but even then the lane matchup doesn't directly correlate with winrate. The TF can still ult to other lanes and win those for his teamates.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Roelo","date":"2017-04-13T10:26:01.787+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I liked it when Ahri could still interrupt dashes with her charm. It felt like someting that separated great Ahri players from the good ones, while Q just gives you movement speed without having to do anything special for it.

I know the boards passes this around as a fact, but tell me, have you seen it in action? Watching the stats, I usually find that when a champion becomes fotm, both go up. This has been true of Ahri as well. I attribute this to fotm players who simply pick champions that are strong. The belief that any given champion is hard to pickup is wrong. Most champions only take a few games to grasp the fundamentals of and get used to the key combinations. This is especially true for high level players who don't need any introduction to what a champion does.\n\n> I'm speaking here for a purely objective point of view, in that numbers in themselves never lie.\n\nVery wrong. Ever heard the phrase, \"lies, damned lies, and statistics\"? Correlation does not equal to causation. People make up meanings in numbers that aren't neccessarily there. Eg. 100% of people who breathe air die.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RainXBlade","date":"2017-04-15T04:24:42.597+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally, Ahri's a really frustrating match up for me to be in because of how safe her kit can get. I get that popping her ult for her safety allows people to have a window of opportunity to capitalize on, but that still isn't enough. Like the previous comments, bump off a few points in the MS she gains on her Q or move it to her passive w/o replacing the heal on it. This is so that she can't just, \"Press Q, now I can either go in, kite someone or make my escape.\" kind of thing when her ult is down. I'd suggest some number changes but I don't know for sure. I don't play a lot of ranked but I play a lot of norms though (yes, you can call me a casual for that), but Ahri's too much of a generalist pick for a mage.","replies":[]},{"poster":"skdKitsune","date":"2017-04-13T16:36:08.274+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dunno whats the point in these threads. Ahri's winrate is high, because players have experience with her kit. It practically did not change since her release (other than the shift from \"nuke\" E-spell to \"kite\" Q). \nPlayers who have hundreds of games with her, have a positive winrate, it is that simple.\nBut her Q movespeed needs to be toned down a bit. Let it increase with ranks and nerf it A BIT on the highest rank.

From a design perspective, Ahri is the most balanced and successful champions they've released in this game. She has appealed to a very very large amount of players, has a kit that is always viable, and despite being a strong pick, never feels overbearing/obnoxious/broken like many other champs do when strong.\n\nRiot doesn't nerf her there's not much there to nerf or very little reason to. In terms of gameplay she's pretty balanced, especially in comparison to a lot of their other champions. It'd just be nerfs to say they nerfed her.\n\nI look at Ahri a lot like I do music. You know a song is good if after multiple years the message in the song is still applicable to people listening to it (Think of the song gangster's paradise).","replies":[{"poster":"Kosm1K","date":"2017-04-15T03:29:30.097+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She's pretty balanced sure, she really hasn't needed any real changes. However, with this update, her Q movespeed just denies counterplay, which is really unfun to deal with. If you're not someone like ekko or fizz that can easily dodge her Q+E while gapclosing, then you're going to have a hell of a time dealing with her. She'll only come in close while her Q is up, and more often than not it'll be to just farm with said Q. Thanks to that Q though, she can not only get farm, but deny you yours with that same Q while making it so that you can't fight her thanks to the movespeed she has while it's flying (which also gets more ms duration since it takes longer to fly back when you run away). most mages can't handle that. All ahri has to do is not lose, while the enemy team has to win in order to actually be useful later","replies":[{"poster":"SpongebobIsLife","date":"2017-04-15T05:33:31.173+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The last statement is completely false as ahri actually gets completely outscaled by nearly every mage mid lane.
