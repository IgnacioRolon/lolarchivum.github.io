This is the LCS. If you play in this league and you can't take advantage of the map when 3 people are stalking 1 of your teammates, you probably don't deserve to be there.\n\nPoint being, Faker carries the game by completely disabling 1 player and drawing 1 to 2 others to him frequently.","replies":[{"poster":"MysterQ","date":"2017-05-22T22:17:03.512+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not saying he is bad.\n\nI am saying if his team was not good enough, his lead in Mid would not have mattered (as much).","replies":[{"poster":"Shahamut","date":"2017-05-22T22:58:18.621+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think that anyone thought you said he was bad, but your statement implied that he didn't carry that game.

They are much more professional and understanding about what is actually happening during matches.  Stop staring at the stat scoreboard and start paying attention to what's going on in the game.  The most notable and important events in a match usually can't be represented with a bunch of arbitrary numbers.  Think zoning, ergonomics, logistics, and economics.  Where were resources focused and what was gained by doing so?  What effect did a given movement, purchase, or kill/death actually have?  What's the overall strategy a team is using and what tactics and techniques are they using to accomplish that strategy?  How efficiently are the players on one team using their time and movement as opposed to the other team?  You can sit there and stare at the score tab all you want and think, \"Damn, look at those numbers!\" all you want, but at the end of the day the team that makes the other guys' nexus explode wins.  You could be 20 kills down and still win a game.  People need to try and get away from thinking in  terms of instant self-gratification and focus more on the things that matter.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Late For Tea","date":"2017-05-22T15:29:27.515+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Half of what Faker does gets blown out of proportion, and he isn't nearly the god people make him out to be. Even just a simple juke or a flash is now considered to be a godly escape, when it concerns Faker. People, mostly analysts and casters, are believing in the hype and legend they themselves created.\nIs he the best player in the world? Probably. People just forget that SKT also has 4 other world-class players on their team, that Faker can rely on. Something that isn't the case for most other teams, that have a weak link somewhere. \n\nThat said, opposing teams do often target him with either counter picks or jungle attention, making the laning phase more difficult for him. Therefore he can't snowball hard either. He still makes a ton of great plays in team fights though. \nAnd it also seems that he didn't have a great tournament in general. He can't always perform at his best.","replies":[{"poster":"Jorencice","date":"2017-05-22T21:58:08.384+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol.\n\n\"Faker is overhyped\".\n\n\"Faker is probly the best player in the world\".\n\nOne of these phrases doesnt belong here.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ale non Ã¨ male","date":"2017-05-22T21:53:08.283+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Otherworldz,realm=NA,application-id=9hBQwnEU,discussion-id=rbsOyvaZ,comment-id=,timestamp=2017-05-22T02:01:22.481+0000)\n>\n> Out of all 5 including Huni, Faker has the worst KDA, most deaths, and second lowest kill participation(lowest being Huni).

And this is the rarest skill in the game when paired with his mechanical skills. Some other guy would have tilted off the earth after having being trashed by his opponent twice in a row, instead he just shrug it off and played the test of the series very well","replies":[]},{"poster":"LegendmakerGX","date":"2017-05-22T08:22:02.406+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think Faker might retire or take a break after this season, you can always see from veteran players that they always don't try as hard any more because of them playing the game non stop and getting bored with the game.

The fact faker had the worst kda doesn't actually surprise me as people are constantly under the assumption that he's a dominant player by being aggressive/racking up kills, when in reality he's so good because of how much he denies the opponent (keeping things to the lowest denominator so to speak).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2017-05-22T08:40:42.376+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Faker generally draws a lot of the enemy team's attention to keep him down, and even then he tends to do well when it gets to actual teamfights.
