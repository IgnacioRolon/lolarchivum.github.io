Up to 150% AP ratio just from auto-targeted spells, with a triple-gap closer so that people can&#x27;t escape.\n\n\nya know, Ahri has a huge tradeoff for that gap closer. \n\nIt's range and targeting, only a single one of her abilities is actually easy to hit, the others either have short range or get blocked frequently.  And it's very transparent. \n\n\nAnd the one spell that is easy to hit....is only easy provided her target isn't moving.\n\nThose are the reasons she was never on top of the foodchain in the midlane, what has caused her to rise gradually however is the fact that all of the others have been nerfed.  With old LB and Swain gone Ahri´s worst counters where out of the game. \n\n\nNaturally she got stronger for it, but what really caused issue's is that it was made impossible to rush magic resist as a mage without becoming a cripple for mana.  Same for armor really, that is why most mages can't handle assassins, it's too difficult to gain the resistance needed to survive and still not lose the ability to be useful after losing one or two rotations.\n\nSo what happens when a hybrid mage/assassin or just pure assassin loses his/her counters? An open field to go freely, it´s not something unexpected.  But naturally people will be frustrated, a champion able to excel in such a variety of situations like Ahri is currently is naturally something that people will direct their frustrations at,  And truly, her W-R-R-R with Thunderlord and luden+high AP or just with gunblade and lichbane-thunderlord is actually too strong for a rotation without skillshots.\n\nAnd thus it was good that Riot moved strength from her W to her E. \n\nBut her R nerf might have been too much, it´s fine to make it easier to counterplay her by moving damage to her slow E but straight out cutting down her damage on the ulti will hurt her ability to actually be able to threaten her opponents.  ¨\n\n\nThus i think that some form of compensation should be added, like a bit more effectiveness out of her passive or R getting a little more dash length back (it was nerfed in the past). \n\nNot that i mind too much seeing how i mainly play Malz and Syndra for mid currently, i just worry that if all the competition dies of people will start looking at my champs instead again x)","replies":[{"poster":"GayFluffyUnicorn","date":"2017-05-24T23:36:27.135+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Where do you see swain gone? \nSwain into ahri is freelo more than ever.","replies":[{"poster":"Thefrostyviking","date":"2017-05-25T10:43:29.512+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=GayFluffyUnicorn,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=WNVw72F3,comment-id=000100010000,timestamp=2017-05-24T23:36:27.135+0000)\n>\n> Where do you see swain gone? \n> Swain into ahri is freelo more than ever.\n\nIt's because of his new Q, old swain could just walk up to her and kill her before she even knew what was going on.

Thus maxing R-Q-E-W is a healthy maxing order. And this you are not wrong to state that it won't affect her mains much.\n\nBut, the R-Q-W-E is abused for a reason.\n\n\nIt's actually a lot of free damage that is nigh impossible to avoid no matter how the opponent tries to, and abusing it has been a thing for a long time now. The fact that this is a thing is visible just looking at the fact that only a third of all Ahri players are in fact maxing E second according to the stats websites. \n\nAnd that is why i claim that you are in fact wrong, these nerf will affect the player populace, just not the actually good ones.....a lot but 15% on her ultimate is actually quite harsh. \n\nIt´s been really, really popular for the general populace since it's quick, free and most of all, easy and effective.  Call it the difference between pro players and the rest. Altho this situation is more along the lines of Pro´s and mains vs the rest. \n\n\nI guess that if this nerf is effective in shutting down this particular gamestyle of just dashing and getting kills while missing 1 or two skillshots in every rotation then she might lose 10-30% of her currently quite bloated playerbase.  And this is not bad because that style of winning fights while missing a ton of spells is actually really toxic. \n\nBut on the other hand if it fails then she will just get nerfed again after that, and honestly that is the part i worry about, for if she get's nerfed to the point where all ins cease to work then she wont be played anymore and thus another mage will cease to be played which would harm diversity.\n\nAt least she might not become a support for it x)","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"NineTailedMystic","date":"2017-05-24T18:24:09.574+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Most Ahri mains max W second.

I have almost 900k points on her and experience prior to the Champion Mastery system. Pro Play where the extra CC duration is actually incredibly useful is pretty different from Solo Q where the extra damage and overall DPS from W is usually better. In addition, one of the best things about Ahri is how versatile she is in her abilities to max based on play style and match up. \n\nCurrently, all three fires hitting one target is 224 + .64 AP compared to Charms 200 + .5 AP at rank 5. Of course, I think E max will become better overall in most situations after the nerfs as W will be 224 + .48 AP (I believe) instead while Charm will be 200 + .6 AP.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Diode","date":"2017-05-24T20:44:45.986+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=NovemCaudaVulpis,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=WNVw72F3,comment-id=000a,timestamp=2017-05-24T05:14:19.546+0000)\n>\n> Nerfs won&#x27;t make a difference, no one maxes W second anyway.\n> \n> Ahri&#x27;s winrate won&#x27;t change.
