Guess I found a new understanding for how the boards are what they are. It's true it may take some work, which is why I started over a year ago trying to voice them. \n\nWell, I think another solution which should be in your power currently, is simply to add new sections to the boards which doesn't have voting on them. Call them \"Discussion\" or \"Debate\" or something, and let us who want to talk without circlejerking, do so. Kind of like \"New player advice\" on EUW boards.\n\nResponse upvoting and downvoting would of course also be disabled here, and only a \"recent\" type tab would exist. This is more like the traditional forum types. I think this would be a suitable solution for the time being.","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2018-03-20T14:29:36.693+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Freshairkaboom,realm=EUW,application-id=6heBIhQc,discussion-id=2r0A7nZU,comment-id=0001000000000000,timestamp=2018-03-20T14:18:52.593+0000)Right, so it&#x27;s true that you don&#x27;t have the backing of Riot then? \n\nThat is not what was said.

Then add a new section that put some posts on the top based on what has the least views over the longest amount of time, if off-hours posts are pushed off the first page of new too quickly (but I think that's unlikely)\n\nSecondly, keep the upvote and downvote at the top beside the title as it is now, BUT you must vote first yourself to see the results AND it's not actually affecting the 'hot' algorithm. Basically it's like the polls except you can't opt out of it and it's embedded onto the left of the title. This is because people inherently want to quickly and efficiently voice their disagreement while remaining anonymous with the least amount of effort available. Give them tools to do so, but not power.\n\nFinally, make a big and noticeable button *at the bottom* that says \"This is a detailed discussion\" or something of the sort, this will be the new 'upvote'. For downvotes, actually require users to click report -> low quality post or spam. If a user makes or post gets an absurdly high amount of reports, a mod review might be in place (for people who make false reports or posts that are either actual spam and should be removed anyway or being targeted, in which case lightly remove some of their downvote weight). Reports feel inherently non-anonymous and it cuts out a lot of the people who think they can be cheeky and downvote every post of a certain player they disagree with.\n\n-----\n\nI agree 100% with your opinions on why voting system is bad right now (people use it for agree-disagree) but I've been directly told by trolls that they downvoted me because they don't want more opinions they disagree with getting popular. I feel like where we'd differ in opinion is that even when told downvotes are not a disagree button, people will still feel the need to downvote so as to stop a certain view they find offensive/stupid to not make it to more people's eyes. In other words, it only takes a few people who don't like you to censor you completely. By making downvotes require a set up or be lumped in with things that would usually literally signal admins, it makes the whole process a lot more scarier since your votes could probably be tracked.\n\n-----\n\nI'd like to say the Reddit style of boards isn't really good, as it does default into single picture or short text posts, and subreddits have to specifically be about a sort of 'technical' subject to attract people who like long paragraphs, like history or change my view. A video game isn't inherently technical but talking about reading gameplay should prefer long paragraphs if you're someone like a dev looking for feedback.\n\nPlus Reddit gets a lot of little things right like hiding votes for a while.\n\nFinally, subreddits are meant to circlejerk most of the time. Going through Reddit is a recreational activity where you go to a sub that agrees with you so you can discuss the intricacies and minor details of the thing you agree about (majority of political subs). This is why I think it's fine for memes and games. But gameplay is where you take your concerns, discussions and disagreements over balance.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Fresh Untilted","date":"2018-03-20T08:38:49.189+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's been years since the movements to remove the upvote/downvote system was initiated.
