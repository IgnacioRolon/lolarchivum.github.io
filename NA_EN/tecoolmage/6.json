The value of a skin is ONLY what the buyer wants it to be. This isn't a trading card game or whatever since someone could value Arcade Sona more than DJ Sona and thus be much happier getting that skin out of a box than DJ Sona. Yes, DJ Sona does \"cost\" $25 in RP or somewhere around that point (I'm on my phone can't check actual RP conversions), but it only actually costs that much to anyone who actually wants to buy it. Also, you are making a VERY ignorant statement in saying that loot boxes have random loot when in fact they don't. It's pseudo random and heavily weighted towards certain things. Riot has gone around patching to make SURE you get things after X amount of boxes meaning that while yes you may only have X% chance to get an epic skin shard out of your very first box you are also \"guaranteed\" one after Y amount of boxes regardless of the base %. Riot has a semi-functioning targeted market already in place with the \"Your Shop\" feature so there is nothing saying that they don't transition that sort of technology towards the loot boxes without us knowing since as it stands VERY LITTLE has to be told to the playerbase in what sort of metrics are used in \"lootboxes\".","replies":[{"poster":"Tomoe Gozen","date":"2018-03-02T20:46:21.671+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I only used DJ Sona because Ultimate skins are the most expensive cosmetic stuff per unit Riot sells. One could argue that Mythic skins are the same thing, which is the type of cosmetic content you are likely to buy with Gems and unlikely get from opening chests randomly or rerolling skins when you have almost all skins. But yes, you're correct. Personal value is more important for the consumer, which means that a non-Sona player might not find any value in owning a DJ Sona skin.\n\nHowever, that's what disenchanting skin shards for OE is for.\nTurn unwanted skin shards in a type of a currency that's used for upgrading any skin shards into permanents. Which means that once you get what you want, you spend this type of currency and the skin comes out free for you.\n\nIf Riot suddenly started weighting cosmetic content in loot boxes based on the champion play rate, then they'd have to actually reduce the frequency of loot boxes for everyone. Because if you're now getting what you want most of the time, they have to make sure their RP sales don't tank or else they'd be in trouble. This might help players who play a few champions but it would also hurt players who'd like to own cosmetics for most of their champions.\n\nPseudo-randomness is there as a bad luck protection tool to make sure that true RNG doesn't screw you completely. Imagine if you're one of those rare players where you open 10 chests individually and in each, there was a champion. Of course you'd feel cheated because you got 0 skins, even if you had to convert them to OE. Unfortunately, personal value of chests depends on how much content you actually want to own in League.\n\nYour Shop is one of the systems i like because it gave me things like Dragon Sorceress Zyra and Star Guardian Miss Fortune. Both of these skins came to me at a 70% discount, which was an opportunity that was too good to pass up, given how little RP i had to pay to get them. Zyra isn't a champion i play a lot currently, but i used to play her and it's a cool skin for her. MF is a Marksman i frequently play but i'm not that attached to her SG theme (skin line is cool).\n\nAlthough i believe that Riot can improve their loot system to be more satisfying for the players, it would likely come at a cost of less loot in general to even things out. So the question is, would you rather get 3 skins a year you want (completely arbitrary number, and i still think they'd have to reduce the drop rate or rarer skins), or opening 40+ boxes per season and potentially have 56+ chances to roll the dice and see what you get in large pool of content?","replies":[{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2018-03-03T08:54:17.752+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not talking about in cases where you can get loot boxes (S champs)\n\nI'm talking about honours, which aren't easy to 'farm' as there's no surefire way to get honour rewards. Being good shouldn't be connected to playing a lot of different champions, it should be an entirely separate system that favours neither playing too much nor playing too little.\n\nand of course the weighing is increases logarithmically by games. So playing 50 games in champ A and 50 games in champ B is better than playing 100 games in champ A","replies":[{"poster":"Tomoe Gozen","date":"2018-03-03T11:33:52.167+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't get the point.\nBeing honorable is only tied to getting key frags. Which means that even if you don't get a single honor during the entire season, you'll still level to at least Honor 3 and are already eligible for Honor capsules that drop additional key frags in addition to certain Honor checkpoint rewards that also grant key fragments.\n\nSwapping Keys for Chests is a downgrade of the system because you can get both, if you're playing championS. Keys are earned naturally by simply playing games while chests are gotten through S rankings on owned champions. I could see this as a trap-swap if it's not properly explained at who this is aimed to.\n\nOne tricks could possibly get a few more chests than usual but for the rest of the people who don't one-trick a champion, it's literally halving your potential loot if you're given an option choose between a chest and a key.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2018-03-02T19:54:43.407+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You could disenchant those skin shards for more OE though.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Child of the Pit","date":"2018-03-02T17:14:14.022+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Only when we will be able to exchange chests for keys","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"A Nunu","date":"2018-03-02T12:21:35.805+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same.\nhttps://imgur.com/OsCzUOf\n{{sticker:zombie-nunu-bummed}} \n","replies":[]},{"poster":"WacingTheFind","date":"2018-03-02T14:09:58.550+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Someone that understands my pain.","replies":[]},{"poster":"wolvius","date":"2018-03-02T17:36:42.387+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://i.imgur.com/S7uyDUV.png[/img]","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sukishoo","date":"2018-03-02T19:00:49.874+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Stop being a one trick /problemsolved.","replies":[{"poster":"Oxyrotten","date":"2018-03-02T21:09:19.585+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Sukishoo,realm=NA,application-id=Ir7ZrJjF,discussion-id=fHBeaR97,comment-id=000c,timestamp=2018-03-02T19:00:49.874+0000)\n>\n> Stop being a one trick /problemsolved.\n\nBooooo!!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Automated Riven","date":"2018-03-02T18:37:11.699+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Welcome to my world.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JohnnyNeverSins","date":"2018-03-02T20:23:47.439+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Honor 0 here :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"Skins Project","date":"2018-03-03T01:00:57.660+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"urmean","replies":[{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2018-03-03T08:58:38.323+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"NO U","replies":[{"poster":"Skins Project","date":"2018-03-03T12:07:33.615+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"noutho","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Tin of sardines","date":"2018-03-03T02:02:55.487+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I not one trick, I not exactly that nice (i'm just decent at controlling my rage access).\nbut since i play a lot of aram, it make sense that i don't have that much chests.\nI also tend to focus one thing at the time so...\n\nBTW, did you know that you have to play like crazy, dead few times and also kill a lot of minions to get a S on aram?\nfunny enough, i got a -S on rumble on Aram.\nand even having mastery 5, i didn't get the mastery 6 token.\nbut that is in another server, also...\nI don't what a mastery 6 anyway, but i feel cheated.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AlienPrimate","date":"2018-03-02T18:45:42.731+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's pretty outrageous.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/NtavyYA.png?noredirect","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ramza Paradise","date":"2018-03-02T18:24:23.374+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Never understood this, my friend is the same way, meanwhile I have 8 chests and 0 keys.
