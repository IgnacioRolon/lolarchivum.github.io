His poke is secondary, he&#039;s meta because he&#039;s the only poke AP with a EWQ burst combo comparable to Jayce or lethality Varus. \n\n{{champion:34}} ? QE burst and R DPS. Her CC and wall is nice but not the *main* reason she&#039;s played. Just buy a ton of damage items and one-shot the ADC\n\n{{champion:115}} Okay he&#039;s partly played for his tower taking ability but not for his poke. He deals huge AOE DPS in an engage, and is a generally good teamfighter\n\n{{champion:112}} is just a burst mage with no identity anymore, he should be played for his stun, ult zoning, and maybe his shield in tandem with his good damage but all he does these days is walk up to the carry and EWQR\n\n{{champion:99}} LuX SuppOrt iS pLAYEd fOR heR shIElD\n\n{{champion:61}} Probably one of the only champions to be played because of her ult being game changing CC, and having a good shield\n\n{{champion:4}} Actually surprisingly has avoided this as well because he&#039;s focused on early game roams rather than teamfights. Also is among the few to have point and click CC\n\n\nAnd this would be Okay in a vacuum, but that leaves champions who have this stuff as their main shtick being relatively useless\n\n{{champion:136}} {{champion:69}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:30}} ({{champion:8}} maybe) Why play these champions when you can play another champion that takes 1 second longer to shred a tank, but in exchange has better CC, (unless you need ryze point and click very badly) burst, utility, and more\n\n{{champion:134}} {{champion:45}} {{champion:63}} cool your bigger numbers overkilled the ADC by 1000 damage, but meanwhile the enemy mage overkilled the ADC by 100 and is continuing to contribute with good poke, lower ult reliance, CC, zoning, and utility\n\nSometimes a champion has such a good secondary niche that they&#039;re meta\n{{champion:268}} {{champion:103}} are mainly damage oriented like above but they have stuff like mobility, CC for picks, play making ability, etc that lets them compete with other mages\n\n{{champion:127}} {{champion:163}} pay for their utility with decreased damage more than the meta mages and in turn manage to stay out of meta\n\n\nThis is probably because of LoL slowly becoming a highly team fight and engage oriented game, with sustain and poke taking the back seat (rip poke>engage>sustain>poke triangle) to keep things exciting but I'd really prefer if playing less damage focused mage was an in between of a supportive role and carry role rather than just being second fiddle backup to the ADC when they can't go in safely compared to a longer range mage\n\nEdit: someone can probably steal my content and repost this because I made the mistake of posting in a low-traffic hour (which means it has less upvotes per hour and won't make it to front page)","replies":[{"poster":"Lady Birdthulu","date":"2017-12-19T16:13:04.177+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Karthus is an AOE champ- the whole point of him is like... anivia's ult... except you're the ult with his aura.

But his ult is one of the longest CD's in game. Considering ya'll gave lux a steriod with her ult [ for reals lvl 3 kill somebody with it and it's up in 10 seconds, else it's 27.5 seconds on 45% CDR NOT COUNTING THAT HAT RUNE]\n\nlike ok... so maybe it's high because it's a global. Again... Panth's semi global ult has a lower CDR. Soraka's global has a lower CDR. TF's is lower. Like even Zil's ult which used to have the same CD got reduced some time ago.\n\nLike I get the fact the new runes aren't working for HALF OF THIS LIST.

They don't need to deal damage. Here's some examples of non DPS/burst ways of contributing to a team, while still relying on gold or levels for bigger numbers:\n\nPoke damage (which is different from DPS in that you don't kill them over 10 seconds in a teamfight but make them back over a minute before a teamfight)\n\nHealth advantage through healing/shielding (R.I.P Soraka mid maybe arcane comet or Aery will give her back the oomph she needs. Vladimir and to a lesser extent viktor can do this)\n\nDamage to objectives (Ziggs, pretty much. Though a champion that deals extra damage to rift, Baron, dragon, inhibs and/or scuttle crab would be interesting)\n\nHeavily level dependent CC, or CC that is only useful when an ally is nearby (Anivia)\n\nThere's an un filled niche for a carry mage who has a Nami E/Sona Q/Vladimir R/Zoe E and is focused heavily on enhancing ally damage with their own.\n\nEven then there should be supportive mages who aren't outright enchanters, Zyra after all is classified as a 'catcher' instead of a battlemage.","replies":[{"poster":"Troll for Trump","date":"2017-12-19T18:41:52.591+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Carry in this context is a role not a subjective definition for how much you carry a team\nADC -> AD carry\nAPC -> AP carry\n\nTHAT kind of carry","replies":[{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2017-12-19T18:51:40.142+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oookay then mages shouldn't be only AP carries.\n\nWhen I said carry, again I meant 'where you funnel resources such as gold into', a good Alistar or Braum can 'carry' in the sense you're talking about","replies":[{"poster":"Mig89","date":"2017-12-19T20:00:05.429+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the issue with the way you define it is its a flawed premise. You can funnel gold and exp into anyone you'd like to but they may not carry. \nIts true you can carry without doing the most damage in a game. Carries tend to poke and sustain until you can find a target to go all in on and that's where they attempt to land their combos.\nA good support can easily carry through locking down enemy carries and preventing them from doing damage. It doesnt matter how strong your carry is if the enemy carry doesn't get any damage off.\nIn that sense mages are not only carrying through damage. A good example is an orianna ulti. If im playing Ori and im behind I know my ult can turn a teamfight if landed properly even if the damage is negligible. Its true damage wins games but enabling/preventing damage wins games by proxy and it can be just as obvious as that ADC unloading.","replies":[{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2017-12-21T16:53:14.316+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with this though, what I'm saying is that non dedicated burst/DPS mages should be more about winning games by proxy but instead they're about one shotting the ADC and each other, with this being a secondary (but still very huge) advantage. Xerath can stop the enemy carry from going in by making them low with Q poke but in soloqueue he's picked pretty much because EWQ can outright kill them anyway from a range.\n\nIt's definitely a large amount because solo queue teams are disorganized compared to competitive (making the deathball 5v5 team too easy and good), but it's also partly because of numbers such as how squishy/tanky each champion is, where damage is distributed in kits, and because even in competitive teamfight comps are easier to pull off than other types.","replies":[{"poster":"Mig89","date":"2017-12-21T18:40:09.879+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is pretty much up to the player one how they want to play.

If you know your damage is not going to be the reason you will win a fight you can sacrifice some damage for the CC or penetration stat and still heavily contribute, if not be the reason your team won a fight.\nMages output damage typically just like ADCs and there are also clear cases of ADCs being utilized for their effects and not just the damage. Goog examples of that would be Sivir, ashe, jhin, varus. I think it is all more defined in game based on what your team needs. Your Xerath example is alright because its true he can combo and kill almost any squishy but that Q threat is a strong zoning tool in a fight. He can ult at any time to poke whether its to initiate or to clean up or even just chunk during the fight when he cant get close enough to land his normal combo. I think they avoid going overboard on mage CC/utility because a competitive team would use it paired with AP damage/ratios to an extreme solo q would probably never see but straight up damage is not something mages are or should be soley focused on.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Troll for Trump","date":"2017-12-19T21:35:50.276+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think mages can be classified as anything else","replies":[]},{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2017-12-19T20:29:00.643+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, funnel your resources into Nunu, he's a carry {{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Mig89","date":"2017-12-19T18:39:56.008+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Carry does not simply mean gold or exp reliant.\nA carry is someone who deals damage required to win the game whether it be to towers (ADCs primarily) or champs (ADCs or Mages)\nThe rest of a team protects or targets carries because stopping their damage output even at the cost of dying will turn a teamfight.","replies":[{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2017-12-19T18:56:32.231+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There should be ways of being valuable to the team without being teamfight engage damage only.
