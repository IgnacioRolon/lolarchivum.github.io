I might have a toaster or something, but I used the updated client before and it was tolerable. Now it is taking me easily 10-20 seconds from 1-5 seconds to get into champion select.

What exactly does low spec mode do? I'd like to weight the benefits of having to wait longer to load back into the client after the game to what it is supposed to do.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Unexisted","date":"2017-02-25T05:13:46.502+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same here!!!
