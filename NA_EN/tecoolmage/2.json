That won't get you anywhere, except into the \"people with nothing to say but tales of ignorance\" category of players I shun.\n\nPlayers inevitably do \"try harder\" in some way or another (remember when that was a go- oh wait, it's still a good thing) when they're playing ranked. You've just gotta get used to that psychology. Are they dodging harder? You'll have to be more conservative with your attacks. Know when you can get away with attacks FOR CERTAIN, not just when you MIGHT get away with them, as is usually all that matters for fun in normals. Players warding more religiously? Know this, and don't rely on the jungler to compensate for your lane mistakes. If you screw up, and the enemy snowballs, it's on you. Also know when to think outside the box. Laning against a total hard counter and don't have a shot, and you know mid will do better in your lane? Switch lanes. Tell people you're switching, but don't wait for permission. If you know it's good, do it. Not everyone who feels the need to declare their opinions in a match is going to be right. And maybe you'll make bad calls too, but let's be honest, most people you talk to in matches won't be making good calls either.\n\nI say this from experience, but not as a high-ranked player (only silver here). I don't care enough to climb ranks. People see \"ranked play\" as one more justification for toxic behavior, and I'd rather climb the ranks of maturity then the ranks Riot gives me. There are times I've gotten fed up at hearing people whine at each other, and, for a few days, instantly mute all players at the start of matches. I've noticed the times I do this, that my win-rates tend to increase, my slip-ups in game decreases, and my kda's are generally better. If I ever get a solid internet service, I might start to play ranked regularly with what I've learned from this. Silence is golden. \"But you can't do dat! Chat is for teamwork!\" ... riiiiight, suuuure. Tell me more about this logical world that never existed...\n\n... My point is, don't let RANKED and the mindset of other ranked players get to you as much as it does some players. Thinking \"competitively\" for many people degrades into thinking like a child. That \"trashtalk, ignore advice, and blame 'elo-hell'\" mindset won't help you as a person (I mean, sure, it'll help your self-esteem... generally when you don't deserve any) and it STILL won't help you as a player either. Put your mind into competitive play if you care, but don't put TOO much of your mind into it. Diminishing returns and escalating losses for some people. \"Slow is smooth and smooth is fast\". You'll do better and play better if you keep calm and chive on (yes, I said it.)\n\nThat's the end of the thoughts that come to me regarding \"how to rank\".","replies":[]},{"poster":"BigBlackZac","date":"2015-11-29T01:59:58.079+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You don't surrender in ranked, or at least people are MUCH less willing to; because your LP is at stake and there's always a come back. The only actual reason to surrender is when your team is down 2 players or something.","replies":[]},{"poster":"EvilMerodach","date":"2015-11-29T01:01:21.832+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, it's more of a difference with draft pick vs blind/team builder.\nIf you pick your lane before the enemy does, except to get counterpicked.\nIf they pick before you, whatever you planned to play may not work, depending on who they picked.\nBlind is kinda just luck on who you'll lane against.\nAlso you'll find more people playing their 'main' in ranked where unranked people will just play whatever to try it out, so if you only play a few champions, there will be a decent chance you'll have more experience in the lane matchup in unranked, but less experience in the matchup in ranked.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ThePartyLeader","date":"2015-11-29T00:46:33.608+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"People just play better in ranked.

I mostly play solo rank everyday and once a week will play norms with friends. Im only Gold 4 but these are the differences i feel.\n\n- In norms people are willing to play more risky and try things out as opposed to dominating or playing smart\n- IN ranked people try to play their best champions, things that they play all the time.\n- Norms is more about team fighting and having fun where as ranked can be but not always is more objective based. \n- Their is less rage in norms because the game has no effect on rank, whereas ranked players are much more motivated because of rank.\n and thats all i got off the top of my head based on my experiences","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sir Yamazuki","date":"2015-11-29T00:44:41.292+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I play both the same, you probably just had a bad couple games.","replies":[]}]}
