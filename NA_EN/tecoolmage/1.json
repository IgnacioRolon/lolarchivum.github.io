That&#039;s not how it works at all, flat MPen is bad against high MR, and you should only get it after void staff at best.\n\nSame thing with Lethality. According to some people literally every armour item is magically countered by lethality for some reason, except for ninja tabi which is arbitrarily better because people say it's OP despite using the same stat. \n\nThere *are* large groups of people who agree with me, just ask summonerschool and lolmath or something. But hearing people in high ELO who otherwise don't use these sources of information saying MR is countered by sorcerer's boots tilts me so hard.","replies":[{"poster":"Lil Lewd Witch","date":"2017-03-30T17:20:41.201+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Math R Hard, Ohkay!?","replies":[{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2017-04-01T01:31:22.467+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But when someone else does it for them it's suddenly wrong if it doesn't follow their flawed knowledge :p","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Hawckey","date":"2017-03-30T17:57:55.602+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wait, is it not lol?","replies":[{"poster":"The Sword Saint","date":"2017-03-30T19:10:09.393+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No. Because of the way resistances factor into damage, they are less effective the fewer of them you have. This causes flat penetration to be extra effective against targets with very few resistances and very inneffective against targets with even a small amount of resistances. Resist to flat pen is not a 1 to 1 ratio, buying 10 resistances counters more than 10 penetration. You are better off stacking ad/ap or buying last whisper/void staff against targets who have even one full item that grants resists, even if its not a full tank item.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-03-30T19:05:04.420+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's even more frustrating with lethality, because the whole reason they changed the name was because \"armor penetration\" is misleading. \n\n**Armor counters flat penetration, not the other way around** {{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[]}]}
