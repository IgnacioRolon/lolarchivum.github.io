Duo&#039;s bring a new problem altogether, that I won&#039;t discuss here.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere it  is:\r\n\r\nThere are two different ways of playing this game for Solo players.   And only one of these two ways, will allow you to climb up Riot&#039;s MMR system.\r\n\r\n1) You focus on your opponent in lane. You expect everyone to do their jobs.  Even if your team loses lane, at the very least, please don&#039;t feed. \r\n  You get high CS, you win your lane, and you have map awareness for your general area.  You help the Jungler when he&#039;s near your lane if he needs help, but you mostly dominate your lane.   You win CS, you win the KDA battle, you take down their tower, you don&#039;t give the enemy Jungler any Gold.\r\n\r\n\r\nOR\r\n\r\n\r\n2) You play the Global game.  You exert your influence on the entire map as much as possible.   You take Teleport or some other high mobility champion.  You leave your lane at opportune times and help gank.  You annoy the enemy jungler when possible.  You win your lane and try to &quot;lead&quot; your team by telling them what objectives to do, etc...\r\n\r\n\r\nNow,  only the #2 method of playstyle will allow you to climb Riot&#039;s MMR system.  \r\n\r\nHowever, if you look at this game logically, intuitively....   like any other game on the planet....  you should be able to expect your team to be somewhat competent at their jobs.   So, you focus on YOUR job....  you do well, but you lose the game.  You are stuck in &quot;ELO HELL&quot;  (old term) and cannot rise in ranks.\r\n\r\nThen, you go to the forums to complain, and people just tell you to get better.  But you scratch your head and get frustrated.  You win your lane 99% of the time in your matches.  You get more kills, more CS, take down tower... you are stronger than your lane opponent and sometimes can even take on 2 enemies at once and win or damage them both very badly.  And here people are telling you to get better?\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is why.\r\n\r\nThis game doesn&#039;t let you play logically.\r\n\r\nYou have to learn the &quot;Global&quot; game style in order to rise (for Solo&#039;s).\r\n\r\nAnd honestly... it&#039;s not fun.   Having to shoulder the burden and add a lot of stress on your shoulders is not fun.    Logically, one should be able to focus on their job, do really well, and influence the game enough to still have a chance to win.  But that&#039;s not how this works at all.\r\n\r\n\r\nI don&#039;t know what the solution to this is.  But LoL really only promotes -1- style of play, the global style.   Playing anything else gets you frustrated.\r\n\r\nMaybe RIOT has balancing issues with the game, I don&#039;t know.","replies":[{"poster":"Düff McWhalen","date":"2018-12-28T00:57:51.999+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's also the time of day/year that you play.

You can do both of your options if you realize the windows of opportunity presented to you in a lot of games played. Having a lead in lane SHOULD translate to leading the team, as well. \n\nI am a very micro heavy player (Top lane main), and I tend to constantly look for fights against my laner. Doing that for me personally tends to give me a lead over them. Since I have a lead over them, I can shove lane and look to put my presence elsewhere. I can gank mid, I can look for tp plays bottom by asking them to place a ward behind the enemies ahead of time, I could even just walk into the enemy jungle with lane advantage and place a deep ward to get more information for the whole team.\n\nRegardless of how team oriented this game is, you have to be able to realize all avenues in where you can exert the most pressure and take advantage of every single second you're playing. If you cant do both of your options you provided and more, you belong exactly where you are in rank.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Don Pasquale","date":"2018-12-28T17:49:17.392+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"This isn't the reason I dislike it. The reason I'm not a fan of the MMR system is the way your MMR doesn't necessarily reflect your rank i.e. you could win a large amount of games and suddenly be playing with people well above your current rank, making it much more difficult to climb. There is no reason for this other than artificially increasing the time it takes to climb.  Just because I won 4 or 5 in a row doesn't mean I should have to have an increased chance of losing the next 4 or 5 simply because I have to face opponents way above my current rank. \n\nAlso, there are times when LP gains/losses make no sense, and are clearly just trying to prevent you from climbing too quickly. For example, after getting around 20 LP per win, I have went on a 3 game winstreak, then started to face much higher rank opponents but only getting 17 LP per win, even though my team's MMR is lower (according to OP.GG, which may be inaccurate). In any case, there is just way too much opaqueness surrounding the MMR system entirely, and it's hard to be positive about the way it works when it SEEMS to be actively working to keep a player down. This may not actually be the case, but I have no evidence to suggest otherwise, other than very high LP gains upon initial placement. That's why people who smurf an account will abandon it and start a new one if they aren't where they want to be within the first 50-100 games.\n\nConstant LP gains/losses and facing only people around your rank seems much more fair and logical to me. And for anyone who complains about smurfs, well, so what? The smurf will climb to way they are supposed to be anyway in a very short amount of time.  No need to make anyone face people one or more full ranks above them (low silvers facing high golds, etc.).\n\nAlso, as a jungler, you need to play the global game, so that's not an issue, just part of the job. You should never complain that you can't climb because of other players. Just nonsense, although bad luck streaks do happen (but so does tllting too). Similarly in life, you should never blame others for your own shortcomings and almost always assume you could have done something differently. External vs internal locus of control.

In the past it was always good to try and help teammates but you could win lane hard and still be able to fight enemy players. But after season  8 and maybe even before that playstyle changed. It's still somewhat viable but much less than it used to be. You are now forced to fight global fights all the time because people die so damn fast teams can't afford to 4v5 ever. Even if you are ahead.... if you fucking misplay even an ounce your dead to people less fed than you.

To assume that each of your four teammates will not have a bad game is irrational, it is quite common that the average skill of each team is relatively equal, but a particular lane or the jungler is a pretty uneven match up for you. Add to that the high potential of tilt, as well as how snowball-y the game is, and you should expect feeding quite often.\n\nYou seem to be confusing logically for selfishly. In a team game, teamwork should be rewarded, and it is. It makes sense that sacrificing several hundred gold of cs is worth it, because getting that gold entales a playstyle that hardly gets anything done, you are always farming. Focusing about 80% of your efforts in your own lane, rather than 100, is logical because that 20% can mean life or death for your teammates, but for you that additional 20% will simply be a moderate power boost. That last bit often doesn't matter, beacause it may simply be overkill, or may not be enough to turn around a lopsided situation, and you die either way.\n\nThis post seems to me like personal preference disguised as objective fact. You say yourself that you don't enjoy having to play that one style (which if you are good, you don't need to, selfishness is rewarded if you are much better than your opponents) and that is fair enough. But it is your opinion, I'm sure there are others who do enjoy being a supportive teammate.\n\nSolo-queue is simply that. A matchmaking system in which you can queue up on your own, your enemies and teammates are provided for you. That doesn't mean all basic teamwork must go out the window.

I.e.- if your team loses, you still lose lp but the loss is mitigated by your performance. So, if your stats are good, you lose 10 instead of 18 but if your stats are trash you lose 25 instead of 18. Work it the same way for lp gains. You help protect against hardcore stat padding because you're losing lp either way if you lose (you still need to help your team win the game first if you want to gain lp) and it would allow people who routinely dominate their lanes or carry their teams to pull away from the ranking level they are carrying while those being carried or costing games fall behind, in comparison.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MarriedToErika","date":"2018-12-28T16:56:56.252+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The game should have a ranking system that help solos in respect to the first style, not just global.

They didn't exactly win Lane, their jungler fed them a lead\n- due to being behind and knowing I couldn't do well in the 1 on 1, I sought to wave clear and roam as much as possible\n- whether I got kills/assists or not, my roams weren't punished. My tower wasn't taken, and my Lane opponent didn't get kills on opposing roams (he mostly farmed mid and tried to follow my roams too late, getting nothing because I didn't overstay)\n- even if I didn't get kills and he was still ahead of me mid/late game, I contributed drastically more to teamfights and got fed off of them. It wasn't because my allies were fed that we won those fights, it was because I made good picks to start the fights with an advantage, and got out without dying while my Lane opponent blew everything trying to kill me and ignoring everyone else. Heck, sometimes he even succeeded in killing me burning his whole kit, while I killed his ADC and half-healthed him, his jungle, and his support, so my team could clean up\n- in the end of game stats, I almost always had the most damage dealt to Champions in the game, and always more than my Lane opponent.\n\nAnd yet, he seems to think he was the better mid and I got carried?\n\nWinning your Lane doesn't just mean getting kills on your Lane opponent and a cs lead. ESPECIALLY if you're receiving jungle pressure. At a minimum you need to take the tower to open up the map to give your team an advantage. More often though, you need to transition your individual lead into a team lead.\n\nI play some jungle - most of the time when I'm deciding where I'd like to look for ganks early, it's a question of which champion can I give a lead to and expect him to be able to bring that lead across the map. Is it a mid that can easily assassinate the enemy ADC and put them behind? Is it a top that can take towers quickly and create a lot of pressure so we can get free objectives when they need to send 3+ to stop him taking the inhibitor? Is it an ADC that can carry teamfights? If you're getting jungle ganks and not transitioning your lead from those ganks to the team, then your jungle \"won Lane\" (not you) and you \"lost Lane\" because you wasted your junglers time without rewarding your team for the investment.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Highest Noon","date":"2018-12-28T16:34:49.164+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Solo Q sucks because no matter what you do you have no control over the skill levels of your allies.

The 1/9 Draven did better than me just because he pushed mid lane so that they would only be able to get inhib and have to reset. And also a scenario where a jungler sees that a jinx has better scaling than the tf mid so he only ganks bot. The jinx isn't better than tf, but she's 4/0 and tf is 0/1.

There's a give and take to everything Riot tries to do. If winning lane equals winning game, who in their right mind would play tanks top? Or scaling champions? I can win lane EVERY game if I only play Pantheon or Darius, but they aren't the best champions for most team comps. \n\nThe way Riot wants you to play isn't \"globally.\" They want you to understand your team's strengths at different points in the game, and play to them. If you're playing a lane dominant champion, you should win lane, but you need to translate that into leads elsewhere so that later in the game, when you fall off like most of those champs do, the rest of your team isn't too far behind. If I'm a smart jungler, and I see that there's an obviously losing lane that eventually swings as the game scales, I'm helping my other lanes early. So it makes sense that if you stomp lane in every game, the rest of your team feeds. I'm jungling, I see a Darius or Renekton top, who can 1v2 my tank laner and myself, I'm telling top \"just hang in there, I'm getting the other lanes ahead, and you'll be more useful in team fights later.\"\n\nIf you want to win lane every game, that's fine.

They've basically made league a solo game in the last 6 months.  League isnt some mindless shooter or linear game that you can focus on your play alone though.  It's a team game.  Playing as a team should be more highly encouraged than it is right now.  If you were on a football team or basketball team you couldnt just focus on yourself and hope to win.  Same with league.  \n\nBut since people like you seem to lack enjoyment in anything that isnt focused around yourself there have been all of these changes in the game.   Teleport is garbage now.
