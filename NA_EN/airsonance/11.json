Thus, I&#039;d like to know about the others. When should I buy Furor? Should I ever think of getting Distortion? Is Alacrity a good option if my team is ahead?

I also get this when i'm a back line support who needs to assist the ADC in kiting enemies (often janna). I really wish they didn't cost more than the other enchantments. \n\n{{item:1303}} I situationally get this only if the CD will affect both my summoner spells, usually interested in the teleport cool down as a top laner. When i know i need to be split pushing a lot and my team will need me to TP in from that duty to help with a team fight. \n\n{{item:1300}} If you are trying to stick to targets as a melee bruiser or otherwise find yourself chasing people down cleaning up team fights. NOTE: If cleaning up teamfights you should ask yourself if chasing too far is a good idea. Often letting them go and switching focus to an objective would be better. \n\n{{item:1304}} If you are losing and need to protect your base or get to lane quickly due to frequent backing. \n\n{{item:1301}} When I need to roam between lanes quickly and i don't have teleport, or if none of the other conditions apply. \n\nThe homeguard TP plays can be quite strong but imho those are conditional and infrequent. I prefer the lowered CD on TP and the MS granted by distortion over the greatly increased MS granted by homeguards that you only get if you are coming from base.","replies":[{"poster":"tplegs0708","date":"2015-08-10T08:59:12.186+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"very nice explanation and well thought out and paragraphed! after reading over thought just about the same answer and explanation for 99% of the same stuff good job.

Part of my reasoning is the move speed boost after you flash and the reduced cooldown on flash as well. In a game you might get one or two good TP+HG plays but with distortions you get one or two more flash engages due to the lower cooldown. Different playstyles i suppose. Also don't discount the added movespeed after teleport that distortion gives, it's often overlooked because it isn't as flashy.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"junglerboy16","date":"2015-08-10T17:51:41.113+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Distortion is great for if you need flash for an engage (see Annie and Galio).\n\nFuror is excellent for sticking power or kiting on ADCs.\n\nAlacrity is just good in general if you have a slow champ and aren't in a position to be recalling frequently, also good for roaming speed.\n\nCaptain is really underrated and a great tool if you are either the first into a fight for faster engage, just a speedy character in general, or need solid disengage speed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chatillon","date":"2015-08-10T07:07:55.118+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When I am adc, i get homies 90% of the time, unless i keep getting caught in fights, in which case furor is really really nice.
