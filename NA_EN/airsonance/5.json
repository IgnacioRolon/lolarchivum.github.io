It might help some people if they were able to check ability base values, scaling percentages, or duration time on buffs and crowd control.\n\nSeeing as Runes have a toggle checkbox to swap between general descriptions and hard numbers, I figure it shouldn't be too difficult to implement on champion pages as well. That way we can pick and choose. Those of us who want to see numbers can, and those of us who do not aren't bothered by having to wade through all the math an ability goes through.\n\nAs a bit of a side note, I think some abilities could do with being updated. Morgana's Q, for example, \"forces the unit to the ground.\" Are they rooted, or grounded?\n\n*Edited for clarity and clearer focus","replies":[{"poster":"e46 Fanatic","date":"2017-11-18T11:28:49.432+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel like this post is kinda all over the place, just confusing to read.
