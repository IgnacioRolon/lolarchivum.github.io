As her passive makes her auto attacks automatically crit, that means Ashe&#039;s damage as a whole against a champion with an Omen is reduced by 10%.\r\n\r\nSo, this in mind, is Ashe a viable option any more?","replies":[{"poster":"Skia Asteri","date":"2015-08-25T23:18:09.029+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Get at least 1% Crit chance, then you will do at least equal damage to non-crit hit until you have absurdly high AD (like 1000 or so, which I am not sure you can actually reach).

Now she can properly kite tanks/bruisers, and though her damage might go down a bit she can at least do what she was meant to in the first place.","replies":[]}]}
