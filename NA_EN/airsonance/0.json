Give the same champion in the same role to two people, and you&#039;ll still see notable differences in how they play, what they build, and more.\r\n\r\nThe problem? Champions and roles tend to favor different play styles. If a champion is used with the wrong play style or mindset, their performance will be sub-optimal and won&#039;t hold up as well as others. Just as well, some roles require different mindsets to play well, such as junglers needing extreme map awareness to keep tabs on lanes and know when to gank.\r\n\r\nSo, here&#039;s where the rest of you come in. What play styles do you see, and what champions or roles favor those styles?","replies":[{"poster":"T RexHasTinyArms","date":"2015-06-20T22:48:58.676+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Assassin, poke, and control seem like pretty basic options and I'd say the other modifier is early bully vs late scaling. Personally I like bully lanes that are either tanky or rely on poke so they can be safe while they bully hard. I think winning hard early and taking control of early objectives to win off objectives if you can't finish early, is easiest for me in solo que bc if your team fails helping out early is important.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheNoxusWarrior","date":"2015-06-20T00:38:22.713+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My play style I've noticed that my play style is to try to stay in lane and bully out my opponent by out sustaining them and then when they're low and going all in on them and in teamfights I like being the one laying the cc onto the carries and being able to start the teamfight by catching a carry out so I mostly play top lane, jung, or mid lane and the champs I play are {{champion:31}} {{champion:3}} {{champion:57}} {{champion:75}} {{champion:113}} {{champion:14}} {{champion:8}}","replies":[]}]}
