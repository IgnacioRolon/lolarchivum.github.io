It seems to work, but I do have questions. First, since the extra bolts from Runaan&#039;s applies on-hit effects, does this include her passive (and therefore passive crits)? Also, should I be building a different attack speed item (PD or Shiv) more often, or does Runaan&#039;s work?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for any tips!","replies":[{"poster":"TouchpadExpert","date":"2015-07-22T13:01:13.243+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Runaans Hurricane is a HORRIBLE item. Before Kalista came out nobody bought it. Now that Kalista is out, only Kalistas should be buying it. The reason why its bad is because it only grants attack speed stats and lots of it. So it should be the only attack speed item you buy. It should never be rushed as rushing it disables you from being able to freeze a lane properly making you much more vulnerable to ganks. And even when you push a lane it has a tendency to miss a lot of CS. I recommend never buying it. Ever.\n\nPhantom Dancer on the other hand is a very useful item on Ashe. It gives an attack speed boost, crit chance, movement speed buffs (Ashe is slow btw) and allows you to walk through minions, so no more minion blocking for you. This item is choosen when you're trying to kite people, duel people or bully them out of lane. Its a great item for when the enemy is not super mobile and relies on speed buffs for mobility where your permaslow puts a real wrench in their plans. So people like Udyr, Volibear, Bard, Miss Fortune and Sivir can get countered much harder when you buy this item.\n\nStatik Shiv is a good item for when you need wave clear or if the enemy is highly poke reliant or they outrange you. Buy this if the enemy team has a Caityln, Tristana, Varus or Kog'maw. Or if they have champions who excel at shoving minion waves like Anivia, Malzahar, Vladimir, Singed, Heimerdinger or anything like that. This is probably the next best choice behind PD for your attack speed item.\n\nAgain, you should NEVER build a Runaan's Hurricane unless you are Kalista.","replies":[{"poster":"TurquoiseYoshi","date":"2015-07-22T22:06:09.750+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or Gnar.

Its an item you buy when you just revived, your team scored an ace and you have to prevent your Nexus from falling before your team can rush mid and end the game. That's the only logical use of this item. Gnarbage players need not apply.","replies":[{"poster":"TurquoiseYoshi","date":"2015-07-22T22:58:25.434+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"ARAM is also a place to use Runaan's.

Rush IE, then PD/Shiv, BT/BotRK, LW/BC, boots, defensive item to taste.  Attack speed and critical hit chance both multiply your DPS, so PD will provide way more damage than Hurricane.  Shiv can be a decent comprise between damage and waveclear, but its passive procs fall off late-game.\n\nAshe's passive crit damage is tied to her critical hit % chance, so by purchasing Hurricane over PD you are giving up a huge chunk of single-target damage in exchange for slightly better turret pushing and much better waveclear.  No matter how cool it looks with her Q it's still a situational item at best.  You need your IE first for damage, and I usually pick up a Zeal as well before I even consider Hurricane.  It can fit in a glass cannon build and help out when your team really needs the extra waveclear or AoE damage, but in general neither of those things are your role on the team.  As ADC your job is to apply consistent single-target damage to objectives and enemies your mage/assassin can't burst down.  Hurricane just doesn't give the stats you need for that role.\n\nIf you're going to run Hurricane instead of PD, consider building double-lifesteal.  Hurricane applies BotRK's on-hit effect, and since you won't be doing as much critical hit damage The Bloodthirster will increase the damage on the bolts and help you sustain through enemy damage.  If the enemy insists on grouping tightly you'll still do tons of damage, but you still probably can't duel a traditional IE+PD ADC.\n\nThe only other situation I'd even think about building Hurricane is when the enemy team has two or more big damage-soaking tanks.  Killing tanks is one of your jobs as the ADC, so if the enemy has at least two really beefy champions in the front line it can be worth applying slightly less sustained damage to both.  In that case you'd usually be running BotRK and Black Cleaver with it, especially if you have an AD frontliner to take advantage of Cleaver's armour reduction.  Phantom Dancer's critical hit damage will increase your single-target damage per attack by about 50% of your AD, so if you can consistently apply half your AD plus on-hit effects to a second target the overall damage to champions will break even.  It's just usually better to focus one enemy down instead of spreading your damage around.\n\nEDIT: And no, Ashe's passive criticals aren't considered on-hit effects so your extra bolts can't crit.","replies":[{"poster":"TurquoiseYoshi","date":"2015-07-22T22:04:54.699+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's one other time you build Runann's.
