Either one or more of my team&#039;s lanes feed (my lane included sometimes. I&#039;m not saying it isn&#039;t my fault occasionally) and we end up defending our base for a good chunk of the game, or we manage to do well enough to the point that they surrender (I haven&#039;t finished a game with a victory  in a while).\r\n\r\nThat being said, is there an issue with this? I&#039;m not saying I&#039;m a perfect player, but when games go either one way or another like this, I feel somethings up. I feel like I&#039;m missing something here, but I&#039;m not sure what.\r\n\r\nAnyone have any ideas?","replies":[{"poster":"DemonBoneJangles","date":"2015-07-15T17:26:10.806+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I myself have noticed this and in my opinion your teammates attitude well effects the way the game ends. Example in a recent match I had a mid who would not stop whining and pinging for help. Mind you I'm the support so as he's getting closer and closer to flaming on us he scores a kill. Next thing I know he's boasting how godlike he is even though he couldn't outplay his opponent until all 5 of us were in the same lane. We ultimately won the match but my point is a players attitude can effect the flow of the match either badly or in a good way. It really depends on them and how your team reacts to them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SanguineLaw","date":"2015-07-14T13:04:03.115+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well in normals the teams tend to be more one sided than not due to players of various skill being placed together.","replies":[]}]}
