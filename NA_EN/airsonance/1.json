I should point out that I&#039;m not looking for the more popular pick or which one&#039;s the most difficult. What I do want to know is how they play, what areas they excel in, and what each one has that the others do not. \r\n\r\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"ilt","date":"2015-07-19T01:57:09.928+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Get Leona.
