The gameplay videos will help you learn about match ups and even the skills of champions you haven't played yourself yet. Another thing that can help you is playing some ARAM games to try out champions you don't normally play and learn how to teamfight well. \n\nHope this helps! :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zellieth","date":"2015-07-28T20:20:24.012+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pretty much everything you just said. But you I highly recommend spamming some ranked games because in normals people don't try as hard.\n\nExample: I'm a Diamond 5 player (seasons 4 and 5 but I recently dropped). I'm learning Irelia in normals. I get dumped on by a gold pantheon.\n^The gold player might think he's a genius for beating me but in reality if this were ranked, I'd have crushed him with one of my main champs.\n\nIn short: Play ranked to get experienced faster.","replies":[]},{"poster":"imonly4noobcakes","date":"2015-07-28T13:35:14.543+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please DO NOT go right into ranked. Practice this season...yes the whole season in Team Builder. Once you have a good number of TB wins under your belt and know roles/lanes then you will be ready for ranked. Don't just learn one role either please try to learn all of them, as ranked is a draft and it's pick order on what role you get. You should know how to play all roles.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ipols","date":"2015-07-28T13:32:54.298+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You should not play ranked for at least 6 more months, there is a lot you still need to learn.\nalso low-level ranked is basically flipping a coin and feeling bad when it goes wrong.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tstrong","date":"2015-07-30T12:52:18.570+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Learn how to play 4v5 because someone always quits or just afks all game","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chatillon","date":"2015-07-28T01:50:51.356+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"learn how to play a carry style champion, like nasus, tryn, jinx, fizz, kat, jungle yi, elise, basically bs.
