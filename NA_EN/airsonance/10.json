To be more specific, I was able to see and ping the cool down of my next available proc so that I don&#039;t have to ruin my ADCs farming rhythm by taking a creep he was looking at. \r\n\r\nWith the new changes, I can&#039;t do that any more. I see how pinging ward charges takes precedence, but before you get to that point, all I can ping is how much gold I have left to proc for to get my wards.\r\n\r\nThe way I see it, {{item:3302}} is the only gold generating item that can mean lost farm for your carry, since the _only_ way to proc it is minions. {{item:3303}} procs can easily be gained through poke and trading, and {{item:3301}} is just a mini game of picking up after your carry. \r\n\r\nI could totally be the only one who noticed or cares. Just my two cents on the matter.","replies":[]}
