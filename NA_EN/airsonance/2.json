I just got out of a game involving two of League&#039;s most notorious champions. Before you ask, yes, it played out exactly as expected when up against both a Yi _and_ Vayne.\r\n\r\nI get the snowballing curve. If they don&#039;t get something early, they&#039;re incredibly difficult to make useful again. However, is it possible to somehow nerf snowballing in champs? Vayne, Yi, and others are notorious for singlehandedly carrying games, and they all snowball hard. The problem I see is that right now, in my opinion, they snowball _too easily_.\r\n\r\nAnyone else feel the same?","replies":[]}
