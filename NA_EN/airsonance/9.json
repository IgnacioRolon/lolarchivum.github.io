How does mana decay, as in a progressive loss of mana, sound for a champion mechanic? \r\n\r\nStarting a game, the champion would have 0 mana. From this point, auto attacking will grant mana for use of abilities, which would then begin to decay either immediately or a short time after leaving combat. During combat, however, the decay would be inactive.\r\n\r\nThoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"Fatalit√Ω","date":"2016-01-05T01:50:45.062+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"this would make for very boring games people wouldn't roam because they would have to stack up mana and their would be less fighting","replies":[{"poster":"AirSonance","date":"2016-01-05T02:17:31.277+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Could be tweaked so people could roam.
