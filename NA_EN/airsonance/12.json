My only reservation is that I have no idea how top lane works. What knowledge is necessary to play top? What skills need to be learned or, at least, understood?\r\n\r\nI should note, I&#039;m okay with champion suggestions, but what I don&#039;t want is champions suggested purely because they are an &quot;easy mode&quot; or &quot;freelo.&quot;\r\n\r\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"colesy","date":"2015-08-15T21:59:44.173+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"you need to learn how to manipulate waves (slow pushing, freezing, knowing how fast you can shove a wave to turret so it can reset, etc.), map awareness to make crucial tps to bot lane, mid or dragon to turn maybe a 3v3 in to a 4v3. learn your champion and other champion power spikes through both their levels and purchases and get a feel for what ability they are maxing (as an adc vs jinx you know she'll just be maxing q every game, against irelia she might decide to do a stun max which can catch you out under turret if you aren't paying attention if you dive her).\n\nitemise towards your laner for your first item, like maybe you want to build a righteous glory for teamfights later on but you're against a vlad, so you could go someting like cowl in to catalyst rather than just outright rushing it since you would have no resistances if you did which can make your laning a bit suckish, plus the cowl will build in to something relevant later anyway,","replies":[{"poster":"DorkunedAuras","date":"2015-08-15T23:04:06.388+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"like Coesy said, you need wave control, as well as the ability to CS well. \n\nYou have to be willing to ward your own lane, probably getting {{item:3361}} at first back after lvl 9, as the supp can't ward you.\n\nYou have to know when you go aggressive, and when to be passive. Bad trades can lose the lane, and the jungler probably won't help you.\n\nYou have to know what advantages you have and don't have, and push what you can against your opponent.\n\nDo not get a huge head, as that leads to dumb things, often times baits into 2v1 or 3v1 situations, and unless you're a fed darius, you're not winning that.\n\nIf you see the enemy pick teemo, dodge.","replies":[]}]}]}
