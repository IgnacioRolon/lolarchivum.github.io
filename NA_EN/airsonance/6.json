Does it not proc from AOE&#039;s any more?\r\n\r\nSecond was Miss Fortune&#039;s Ult. Sure, I was standing in the area, but couldn&#039;t it at least block one wave of damage? Even if it didn&#039;t block damage, my spellshield didn&#039;t proc to begin with.\r\n\r\nThird is Gangplank&#039;s Parrrley. This is probably the shakiest one for me. Shouldn&#039;t it proc from the projectile?\r\n\r\nIf this is a glitch, it goes without saying this should be looked into and fixed. If this was intentional, Riot, can someone change the description of spellshield so we know what it can block?","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Dusteon","date":"2015-07-28T05:32:32.644+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"For the first two, those are both constant AoE damage things; Spellshields do not block those.\n\nFor the third, it could be Riot finally made Gangplank's Parrrley (which for all intents is a melee autoattack with a higher base damage) finally not stop at spellshields.
