You are able to push your lane in.\n2.  The lane you want to gank is being pushed in by the other team.\n3.  Your jungler is heading that way as well.  \n4.  The lane you are ganking for can snowball or you want to shut down a champ that can snowball while you still can.","replies":[{"poster":"Swarovsko","date":"2017-10-01T21:05:42.690+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for the advice.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-10-01T20:53:18.992+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"After you force someone out of lane or push a wave at them while they are low hp - giving you time to go places and come back without them murdering your tower.","replies":[{"poster":"Swarovsko","date":"2017-10-01T20:57:16.575+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But isn't it better if I poke the low hp enemy undertower trying to farm?

AD assassin's are great roamers and if you can't snowball your lane its a good idea to roam. \nCertain Mages like Ahri Syndra are good roamers as well but you want to shove your lane in and try to roam from Fog of war. If your opposing laner has to CS under tower chances are they won't follow the roam sometimes forget to even ping it.\n In a perfect world if you notice your enemy roaming its safe to say following the roam is worth while unless you have a pick like Ziggs who can take towers quickly. (however if you notice it too late don't even bother because you won't get there in time)\n Following a roam can be dangerous especially blind so i personally just try my best to ping roams and shove the tower in when i play control mages, with a little luck the roam wont work and you will get an XP advantage.\n Roaming with a jungle gank is nice because 4 man Bot seems to be what you do this meta.\n If you are a support after you shop always look to roam mid and catch someone off guard, or if your ADC has to back but you are healthy feel free to sneak a roam in. \n If you are Top and objs like inferanl drake are bottom as well as first tower gold and you see 4 members of your team going bot TP roam on in and just 5 man Bot because there is nothing an enemy bot lane can do vs that.\n If you take your tower in lane look to roam because chances are you can't take down the T2 tower just yet so always look to take the outer 3 towers as fast as possible.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Curious Kat","date":"2017-10-01T20:59:56.885+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can roam after getting a kill, or even nearly killing your opponent. \n\nYou can also roam after shoving a big wave to their turret.\n\nHere's a really sneaky way to roam that's pretty cheese, But roam after you base, don't show yourself in your lane, and roam through the JG to a lane. They won't have any clue unless warded. And usually, they won't ping the MIA till it's too late.\n\nOther than that, the rest is fully situational. But if you want to force a roam, the above is how.","replies":[{"poster":"Swarovsko","date":"2017-10-01T21:01:51.245+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the advice.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"YokoNomi","date":"2017-10-01T20:53:30.398+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"There's no real wrong time to do it. I think as long as you're in a circumstance where you aren't having your tower pushed down, one reason or another, that opposing mid laner will be distracted enough for you to act in other lanes before they can respond (assuming they don't catch vision of you roaming or you don't run into the enemy jungler along the way)","replies":[]}]}
