Sure, she was pretty decent before literally every carry jungler was nerfed, but now that she is the last one standing besides Kha'zix, she's now seen as OP.

If you nerf the top dogs the ones under them will overtake them. Similarly if you buff the weak (the ones under top dogs) they'll eventually overtake the top dogs. The result will be that the top dogs will eventually see lesser gameplay whilst the weak will see more. its basically distributing the playrate as much as possible. \n\n\nNow let me explain why the former is a bad idea in comparison to the latter. \n\nIf you nerf a champion and it turns out that this champion is completely out of meta then only that champion's  main will suffer. They can obviously main someone else instead.\n \nIf you buff a champion and make it OP (by mistake ) instead of balancing it with other midlaners. This'll mean that all other champions and their mains will suffer. \n\nMoral of the story is... Nerfing a champion only upsets the mains as meta sheeps will just pick someone else to climb or to win. However over buffing a champ (by mistake) means that meta sheep can abuse them and make life miserable for all other players who either are not meta sheeps (and follow favoritism) or there is no worthy competition i.e. like for example how in the history there would be one jungler that just outclassed every other jungler and etc.\n\nTherefore making a mistake with a buff can have a negative effect on the majority whereas nerfing a champ only affects a minority. There will always be picks that are meta but mistakes in buffs are less forgiving than mistakes in nerfs. You can see this from the history of LOL i.e. when lethality items were consecutively buffed, zac was buffed, kassadin in season 2, nidalee (once upon a time and then was made garbage) and etc. Now look for example how leb was made garbage (did you see an insane uproar)? Also from what i saw, only the mains were making threads about her but nonetheless i do believe in the notion of balancing all champs as much as possible. So that people could rely more on personal skills than the champ itself. It'll increase the diversity of the champs that are played and make the game much more enjoyable. Sadly that goes against the money making schemes so i don't blame a free game trying to get money to run its game.","replies":[{"poster":"Shablagoo","date":"2017-07-16T00:10:52.864+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It does more then just upset the players it sometimes removes them from the meta, Nautilus was completely taken out of the top meta after his nerfs, Shen as well, literally push now mao to the top of the tanky tops.

Nerfing Iveran just put Nunu at the top of jg's same with nerfing most carry jg like explained before this isnt good balancing.  \n\nBuffing lux because she is at the bottom wont make her overtake anivia it will make her more viable instead of being useless. If you start adding more champions to the diversity wont completely knock top dogs off it will just balance them, nerfing a champion till their useless isnt good balancing at all this is what we have been doing for so long and it literally isn't working. Adding more champions starts to add counters to the pool and making them take certain champions out, I think buffing Xer will work wonders on malz because he can poke off his shield and poke him down it might knock him off the top which is a good thing, but it wont make Xerath the new op champion because champions like kass or Kat exist to counter him.","replies":[{"poster":"sobi999","date":"2017-07-16T12:00:19.857+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Therefore making a mistake with a buff can have a negative effect on the majority whereas nerfing a champ only affects a minority. There will always be picks that are meta but mistakes in buffs are less forgiving than mistakes in nerfs\"\n\nThat above is a very important concept in league. We all know that league is a complicated game and balancing it 100% is literally impossible, especially when they make changes every 2 weeks to make the game less stagnant. Nonetheless, for riot to run efficiently they need meta picks so tbh balancing at its apex is not the actual intention of riot. \n\nNerfing or buffing champs can backfire and obviously intentional or non-intentional from riot's side, its the players that suffer. Some champs may not be strong but their utility makes them useful to be picked on LCS. For example shen is a very common pick in LCS although he is not the meta pick for top lane. Also buffing lux will make her dominant in lower elo's as she'll always be weak at higher elo's. Even if you were to nerf anivia, she'll just get overtaken by ahri or ohri but the point still remains that whichever route you go buffing comes with a lot more risks than nerfing. \n\nI agree that buffing sometimes is a better choice like you explained that it increases diveristy in the lane as there is more competition now but if a champ is dominating in lane (according to stats) then i believe its better to nerf that champ than to buff 10 other champs to bring them back to meta or make them viable. Its obviously alot more complicated than this as you have to think about counter picks and at what elo the certain champs dominates or is weak at, but i believe that buffing compromises alot more risks to the majority of the playerbase.","replies":[{"poster":"Shablagoo","date":"2017-07-16T14:34:44.948+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with you buffing is honestly something Riot has a real problem with, especially this patch Singed is at a 55% winrate, with a playrate of 5%.

If you are engaged on, your shield is your first response, then your W (which is only a slow and a bit of damage, won't help if you're against a champ that is super sticky). The last ditch response will be the ult which can buy a precious second which can make a difference, especially if you're engaged on by 2 or more of the enemy team. But because of her completely conditional CC (her only effective CC being her ult) if you are ever dived, jumped on, whatever, you are fully relying on summoners and your E shield. As a result, I don't feel like Orianna does particularly well when made a target by the jungler, or when you play against a true early game champ (i've done well playing Taliyah into Ori previously). \n\nIt's all relative though, lots of mages don't do well when being focused hard early, if any. When it comes to late game impact, Orianna is very similar to Kennen, massive potential to do something amazing, but also massive potential to completely balls it up. Late game, the safety net she has earlier in the game is completely taken away, all it takes is a trash team engage and all will be lost. You cannot force a good Ori ult, very rarely will it come easily. \n\nI would agree that late game, you would rather face a Syndra in a full on teamfight than an Ori. However, the reality is that in solo queue, you don't get that in many games. If the team grouped up at every stage and never splitpushed, I wouldn't like to be against an Ori, if the team splitpushed constantly and never grouped up, I wouldn't want to be against a Syndra.","replies":[{"poster":"RavenMagus","date":"2017-07-21T04:58:48.074+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can agree that she can be pretty weak when piled on.  In a 1v1, though, it's actually really hard for an assassin to dive on her in lane - she's got the shield that stops her from being one shot, and her ulti and the rest of her burst is really easy to land.\n\nWhich is part of the reason I dislike her.  She does so much damage that having a Morello's is pretty much enough to 100-to-0 an enemy squishy (i.e. any other mage that also has just a Morello's), and the ulti is actually impossible to dodge in a 1v1 unless you flash it or have some mobility to dodge with because its area is so huge.\n\nThat's mainly my issue with her.

She isn't massively reliant on any single ability, they all flow into each other, so if you nerf one ability, it will have a knock-on effect to every other ability too. Neither can you really shift power around her kit, if you were to say \"ok, Ori is too much of a bully early, lets hit her Q\", where would you buff to keep her balanced? Her ult and W are always used in combo so buffing either will make her teamfight and her burst even stronger. You put it on her E, she then becomes a counter to other burst champions, including assassins. You buff her passive, then Ori's will probably start buying Lich Bane. If you straight up nerf her Q without any sort of compensation, I can't think of a nerf that wouldn't open up a glaring hole in her kit that would kill her off as a champion. \n\nTo be honest I think the only thing that will help Ori fall in line with the rest of the mage pool is a serious look at the whole AP item tree. She is the best generalist mage in the game, and Morello's is the best generalist AP item in the game.
