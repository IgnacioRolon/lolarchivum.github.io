For the first time ever I had to stop playing the game this season because I just couldn&#039;t stand how unbalanced things were and the fact that this has never happened to me in my whole League Of Legends experience tells me something. I hated lethality meta with a passion to the point where I just couldn&#039;t enjoy the game anymore. This happened again with Ardent Censer meta. I still hate Twitch avoiding nerfs for more than a whole year, I still hate how weak turrets are and I hate the game even more when I think about rift herald and demolish and EVEN MORE when I think about that garbage &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;buff&quot;&quot;&quot; towers got. I hate how blatantly one sided the games have become (and how predictable they are) and I hate Riot for being silent about it. I feel like the balance team is doing nothing expect filling patch notes with words in order to make it look like they are actually improving the game but really, they&#039;re just doing NOTHING. That Ornn buff on his E proved me once and for all that.\nI&#039;m at that point were I log in and then think &quot;do I seriously want to play League of Legends tho?

I was almost about to write a post myself but it seems like the whole boards is already filled with this kind of stuff. Literally the only reason i want to play this game is cause i know it 'can' be fun (it used to be fun) and because i really want to climb in solo queue. But when you really think of it, even if i get where i want to get, it feels like all that says is that i was lucky enough to be on the right team more often than not. \n\nI feel helpless when i lose, cause I feel like we had no chance to come back at all. When I win, I don't feel a thing cause it was most likely a stomp too. And I'm talking about 90% of my games here. And don't get me started on the meta. I can't even play my favourite champs because they happen to be on the weaker side of things and they stand no chance againts their broken/busted counterparts. Also, I main adc, and i really, really hate this new poke meta, but tbh it's the only thing you can really play besides tristana and ezreal. All the others ones just get wrecked in teamfights since basically everychamp can kill you. \n\nSo basically, what i'm saying is that I'm tired of having to pick the same 3 champs over and over just to have some chance at winning and still I have to hope that my team does not lose lane either cause else I'm fucked anyway.\n\nAnd indeed the balance team should step it up. Do they even play this game themselves, or are they all Diamond+ players. Because really you can say all you want that a champ is counterable but in my elo you can not expect that everyone picks/plays for the teamcarries. Most games dont even have a tank. I really dont understand how some champs dont get nerfed harder like Zoe (land E is free kill, broken dmg even with no ap, alse free summs) or Ornn (litteraly wins every matchup. Best engage of the game. And so much dmg AND cc) for an example. Leona too (towerdives at lvl 3 when u're supp is gone for 30 secs).\n\nAnyway some people are gonna complain about my elo, yeah bla bla. But that's not the point here. Riot got to realise that 90% of the players are gold and lower and for THEM the game is not fun anymore. But no they keep doing stuff only for challenger and LCS balance. How does that even make sense.\n\nLong story short, I really can't stop playing this game cause i want to climb so bad, but Riot needs to realise that the game is not fun anymore for a large portion of their players. It's also not healthy for the game cause toxicity and ragequitters in-game are really more frequent now too. Climbing is basically RNG at this point. First player to make a mistake loses the game. \n\nP.S. this is basically just a bunch of my thoughts scrambeled together, I hope it makes sense.
