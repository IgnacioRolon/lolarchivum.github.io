With {{item:3147}} {{item:3814}} {{item:3142}} I feel like I only do damage with my ult but whenever my ult is on cooldown what&#039;s the point of Miss Fortune? I don&#039;t see damage from my autos and the only demaging spell is my Q and ult. It feels pretty underwhelming compared to champion like {{champion:18}} {{champion:29}} &amp;co who can do damage anyway even when their abilities are on cooldown.\r\nI tried crit items but I feel like I do no damage with my ult and it&#039;s hard to kill stuff only with your normal attacks with MF. I&#039;m probably just bad at the champion but what do you build on her?","replies":[{"poster":"Death by Glamour","date":"2018-02-18T01:03:54.527+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lethality for thw oneshots amd ult botting\n\nCrit for teamfighting","replies":[]},{"poster":"Azadethe","date":"2018-02-18T00:15:03.005+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally, I think MF can build anything:\n\n-She has strong Trinity/IE synergies.\n-Strong Lethality\n-Strong Hybrid\n-Strong Crit\n\nShe even goes good with Tear of goddess builds, at least as a support.\n\nLethality is for early game wins.

The idea is you dont go to lategame with her, if you can avoid it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Swarovsko","date":"2018-02-18T00:53:22.794+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"thanks for the answer!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-02-17T23:10:14.422+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Her damage is not very good aside from abilities, the point is you harass with Q, and her teamfight potential.
