This is phenomenal. Rito&#039;s actually managed to balance her mid, and support for multiple elos. In bronze she has a 53% win rate, and in plat plus she has a 51.5. Its still sloped towards bronze being better for her, but it doesn&#039;t seem like such an overwhelming gap now, and her support win rate is actually HIGHER for higher elos. I&#039;m hoping her win rate isn&#039;t found as oppressive, because she IS  simpler champion to learn and get in to. I&#039;d also like to say it feels really rewarding to have so much time on her, and I&#039;ve been enjoying the buffs a lot. I&#039;m actually really concerned Rito may just gut her randomly, praying that doesn&#039;t happen, and assuming it doesn&#039;t... You guys really knocked it out of the park in my opinion. She feels smoother to play, while still being Lux, and having clear cut weaknesses and strengths. A lot of people have complained about some balancing decisions, but I&#039;ve got to say this is honestly amazing from the POV of a Lux support main. Really well done guys, 10/10 ~~would balance again.~~ pls dont touch my champ anymore","replies":[{"poster":"Lady Hammerlock","date":"2018-05-08T10:02:36.957+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly I'm just bothered by the fact that her ultimate can have the cooldown of a basic ability(or in the case of ult hat+presence of mind, 2 kills = no cooldown)\n\nApart from that, she's actually fun to lane against now because she doesn't just spam E constantly, and having it basically be a free hit most of the time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Skeletons Grave","date":"2018-05-08T20:52:04.469+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Idc what support lux win rate is or if its gotten better, i do NOT want a lux support on my team ever.

But aside from my personal tastes I'm slowly adapting my playstyle (can't be as aggressive in early laning anymore) and she seriously is stronger. Even from midlane I find maxing w beneficial now and the reduced cooldowns help a ton in teamfights. Her overall winrate is still 48,5 as from opgg so I don't see a Nerf coming honestly, at least for what concerns her midlane. Her winrate skyrocketing in bronze is nothing to be surprised about when you put emphasis on the skill no one is able to dodge there xD","replies":[]},{"poster":"LuxannaVeritas","date":"2018-05-08T04:01:55.569+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"I've always been a Lux support main ever since I've started playing, and I have to say...\n\n...these changes are GREAT!
