This makes absolutely zero sense. When a ranked queue comes up and the option to either accept or decline comes up, any player should be able to decline as many matches as they want to their heart's content. This is a ridiculous travesty. I couldn't get over that you actually lose LP for declining a fourth match. Let alone a time penalty. What kind of horrible nonsense is that? \n\nHow is someone declining a match for 10 times, 30 times, 10,000 times in a row, doing anything but inconveniencing the person declining it? You find another match almost immediately. This is a power-mad, power-hungry, officious and micromanaging bunch of absolute nonsense. There is no reason to need to attempt such a minor streamlining of matchmaking in such an extreme, hindering and negatively-reinforcing fashion. \n\nIt takes a mere second or two before the next person jumps in for a game. There is -NO- argument that you can make that people shouldn't be able to decline matches to their hearts content. I can see an argument for leaving during champion selection as that takes considerably more time, but even then that shouldn't cost people LP. I can see an argument for some possible negative reinforcement in that area by taking away time, as they are wasting everybody else's time. But that has nothing to do with decline bans.\n\nThere could be a number of reasons why someone would decline a game 9 to 90 to 900 times. Please, for the love of ****, where is the argument, logically, without resorting to some kind of legal positivist, or obedience to the state type of argument where it is ok to punish someone for a decline, which takes mere seconds out of the other queuer's lives. This is an absolutely preposterous proposition. Sorry about the cursing, but I'm so far down the road with this nonsense that I'm subsequently extremely upset with this.\n\nHow about some positive reinforcement? Why does it have to be negative? This is the core principle that riot always preaches about trying to remove toxicity and removing negativity. How can Riot stand in this position of sacrosanctity with regards to the abeyance of accounts for the most minor err you can think of. Why not give LP to people who rarely decline matches? I'd be all for that. That would be a great positive reinforcement for people accepting games. \n\nI'm sure there are an innumerable amount of ways you could add in a positive reinforcement aspect to this game if you just put your collective minds to it. Which would have the effect of reinforcing the positive player attitudes instead of punishing players, which only serves to reinforce negativity. This is -such- the wrong angle to approach things from.\n\nYou always post all these statistics about players improvement from tribunal measures, but are you even counting players that stop playing on certain accounts and just migrate to another one? Has this fact accounted for every single possible obviating factor to posting a statistic that is surely spurious? I sincerely doubt this. Who is running this show? \n\nPlease change this Riot.\nThanks,\n-Disgruntled, non-regular forum posting league player","replies":[{"poster":"Athina","date":"2016-08-02T01:33:41.281+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You get punished because you are wasting the time of everyone else trying to get into that game for no reason at all.
