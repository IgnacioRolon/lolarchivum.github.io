I guess Riot is just lazy and couldn't be bothered to come up with an actual estimation algorithm thus instead just hard-code the string to be \"3 minute\" and leave it at that.\n\nNot to mention, that 80 million players obviously isn't talking about just 1 server, but all servers in total (the stats doesn't include the players on Garena server, too, as it was gathered from pulling data from Riot's API). So it's not like you're actually matching with 80 million players at once.\n\nLastly, that stats concerns the MONTHLY player count, and obviously when talking about the day-to-day player count, it would be significantly lower and only a fraction of the said count. Similarly, it also doesn't state whether or not it's each unique individual players or just the amount of active accounts because we all know smurfs are a thing and many people own a great number of to cycle between them, too.\n\nLeague is indeed super popular, but let's still be realistic about analysing the stats.","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-01-19T08:37:24.946+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SEKAI,realm=OCE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=EBiEOsRT,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2019-01-19T08:31:47.346+0000)\n>\n> The queue time is just written to be estimated 3 minute **at all times** despite it rarely ever go past it, even on barely populated server like OCE which only really go past the 3 min mark in queue time in late hours.

Though, last time I did use intro bot to cheese some of the missions, I didn't notice the queue time was over 3 min tbh, I'd say my impression was that the queue time for intro bot was about the same as other modes; or maybe OCE is just filled with desperate noobs who want to feel good about themselves, could be a possibility.\n\nAs for the estimate, it's also down to personal experience. Because on OCE and my experience, the timer never shows anything other than \"Estimated 3 minute\" from my immediate memory (though ofc as said, only in the late hours do the queue time actually surpass 3 min), as such I've always assumed it's a static hard-coded message.

Mb.\n\nFrom what I've seen, intro bots generally have two experienced players looking for a quick win, two scripters, and one new player. And then, of course, when you load into a match, one bot says lines from two of its teammates (possibly with an error message if one of them is Fidddlesticks), and then you open the shop and your champ has no recommended items, and so on.","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2019-01-19T09:09:40.684+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=KFCeytron,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=EBiEOsRT,comment-id=000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2019-01-19T09:00:25.384+0000)\n>\n> From what I&#x27;ve seen, intro bots generally have two experienced players looking for a quick win, two scripters, and one new player.
