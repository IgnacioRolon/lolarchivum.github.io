you gotta be kidding  i hope the adcs nerfs on the next patch stop that going tank as adc madness and destroying everyone (and lastly that was the reason Riot nerfed Ahri back in season 4-5 cause she was doing damage while building tanky thats exactly the reason today with adcs such as Kai&#039;Sa) thanks for reading.\n\n(I want actual answers not just downvotes cause i can do that too if i dont care its easy)","replies":[{"poster":"Dr Dog","date":"2019-02-01T14:57:28.120+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"TL;DR op lost to a fed kaisa so kaisa needs to be nerfed despite next patches stormrazor changes already being a nerf to her","replies":[{"poster":"manolis201","date":"2019-02-01T14:58:34.112+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Dr Dog,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=94Y6kEqX,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2019-02-01T14:57:28.120+0000)\n>\n> TL;DR op lost to a fed kaisa so kaisa needs to be nerfed despite next patches stormrazor changes already being a nerf to her\n\nYes i know we will see tho if that will change anything.","replies":[{"poster":"Dr Dog","date":"2019-02-01T15:02:31.377+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"shes in a fine spot rn anyway, shes finally found a balanced state after how long she was broken","replies":[{"poster":"manolis201","date":"2019-02-01T15:04:30.346+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Dr Dog,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=94Y6kEqX,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2019-02-01T15:02:31.377+0000)\n>\n> shes in a fine spot rn anyway, shes finally found a balanced state after how long she was broken\n\nDid you even read what i wrote?","replies":[{"poster":"Dr Dog","date":"2019-02-01T15:09:13.064+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"that your team fed a hyper carry and you lost because of it?
