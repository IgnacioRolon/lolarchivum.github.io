Looks like it's just when he dies, the gray overlay is reapplying once he's alive again. I may have not have pulled the latest file revisions when I checked before, but I think we've got solid repro now. Going to dig into this a bit more!

If you have the skin on and you die either to an enemy champion or tower, when you respawn your texture will be correct. However, upon leaving the fountain, your texture will change to the dead Wukong texture. If you want to test this, you can go into the practice tool and teleport into the enemy fountain. When you repawn run out of fountain and your texture will change either when the ghost effect wears off or after you pass the nexus towers.","replies":[{"poster":"LeeVí","date":"2018-03-23T06:07:43.601+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"YEEES THAT I WHAT I MEAN!!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Wood Four","date":"2018-03-22T21:33:10.214+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is legit.
