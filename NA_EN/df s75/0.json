And in those 10 matches, I have 1 vayne on our side who decided to go completely afk because he failed to outplay the enemy Jax and got killed. I have another 3 games involving players think some one is just plain too stupid and refuse to play. \r\nJust take my last game for example, our Lucian made a mistake and got killed by the enemy Jinx early, so he is a bit behind in items and then a fight break out in the dragon's pit, and with a under farmed adc on our side, we lost the fight 0 for 1, our support nautilus says in the chat \"Its just sad to watch this Lucian, you have no damage\", and our Lucian replied that he is under farmed, and he is trying to farm to get items to deal damage, so we should wait a bit to team fight. And out nautilus says something like its all your fault, I don't want to play with you, and he decided to when back into the base. About 5 minutes later, he come out of the base and used his ult and went back into the base again. It is clear he is not afk, he is watching the game and decide he do not want to help. \r\nI mean I understand if we lose lp in rank because we got outplay by the enemy. But its really frustrating that I lost my ranked match because there is a player on my team who refuse to play. And for some reason this happens a lot more in ranks then in normal.\r\n3 out of my 10 placement match has someone refuse to play and another one has an afk. Thats like 40% chance of a 4v5.  \r\nIt is just way to frustrating to play rank, and it is not just happening to me, one of my friend is in gold 2, and every single time in his promotion match, there is at least 1 afk, he played his promotion match 5 times this season, and happen every single time. Riot, plz, plz do something about it.","replies":[{"poster":"Sergeant Stephen","date":"2015-03-31T19:57:22.203+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":1,"body":"Only if afk wins are win prevented.

What that means is that the overall lp movement for every game is 0. The amount in should always equal the amount out when averaged over the entire game. So if my team moves up 100 LP for winning, your team MUST move down 100 for losing, or over time everyone either gradually accelerates towards challenger or descends towards bronze. By maintaining a zero sum system, the ratios of players in each league are maintained at approximately equal(with some exception accounting for people who are in the 'grace' period at the bottom of a tier). This ensures the system retains some level of balance.\n\nIf we add loss prevented to every afk game, we suddenly have a HUGE number of games that have LP in but NO(or virtually no) LP out. This results in a huge problem for the league system as we have more LP in than out and gradually over time the AVERAGE ranking rises, and thus ranking ceases to have meaning since everyone's suddenly in platinum or higher.\n\nFor anyone who might suggest that we just make the afk/leaver take the FULL penalty... how would you feel if you had an internet outage and dropped a full tier because of it even if you'd NEVER had a leave in your life other than that? 'cause that's what that would mean. Somewhere around 90-100 LP loss for a single game. This is FAR too punishing on accidental, unintentional, or emergency leaves and would simply result in a lot of perfectly decent people quitting the game over a single incident they had no control over. An accidental leave ALREADY feels really bad because of the stupid leaverbuster warning and the fact that you know you caused a loss for your team. Adding a 100 LP penalty to it would just mean most NORMAL people quit after their first disconnect while the intentional leavers just don't give a shit at all.\n\nEdit 2: I also completely missed that this was a necro lol... silly necromancers.","replies":[]},{"poster":"xXorihimeXx","date":"2015-07-03T17:14:12.065+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Coming from someone who spends a lot of time and money on this awesome game, it is very disappointing to have someone afk or quit at the start of the game, thus resulting in a loss for my team (usually) and resulting in a BIG RED DEFEAT on my match history.

It would be so great if the losses due to afk'ers and quitters, showed up as a different color (yellow maybe) that says loss prevented. That way my 1/7/2 match with Diana that lasted 20.00 minutes, will atleast have an explanation of why I did so bad (4v5) because of the indicator on my match history.
