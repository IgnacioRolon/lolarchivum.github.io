I was playing olaf and trying to chase Soracha to whack her with my battle axe weapon and a starblast fell on me and exploded I don&#039;t know what spell that was but it looks like a falling shiny planet. Her star healed most of her health back after too! I chased her but I could only move slow so i got angry and through my weapon at her but she ran into a bush and I could not see her and she got away. After that battle with her i had to ran back to the fort to gather supplies and compose myself. I ran back to her with the speed and might of a wild chicken and started smacking the jynx standing next to her. Soracha healed her to full healgth 4 times and also healed herself with that annoying starblast. I tried to flee but i died. She even through some bananas at me, what a wacky champion!! I know that bananas are a very strong fruit but it was ridiculous! \r\n\r\nSoracha has been getting away with this for too long and needs some big nurfs to her healings and banana attack. It is time that we take a stand against her.","replies":[{"poster":"Colton147","date":"2018-09-18T06:56:49.208+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"New champion confirmed.\n\n{{champion:16}}'s evil twin.","replies":[{"poster":"EvilMoustacheMan","date":"2018-09-18T16:24:25.401+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm still waiting for Riot to put her hot cousin Sriracha in the game.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Atmosphere","date":"2018-09-18T16:03:34.891+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm struggling to tell if OP has a hard time with English or if this is a god-tier shitpost","replies":[{"poster":"egOrhythm","date":"2018-09-19T10:23:01.797+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Atmosphere,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=NUy3w0ye,comment-id=000c,timestamp=2018-09-18T16:03:34.891+0000)\n>\n> I&#x27;m struggling to tell if OP has a hard time with English or if this is a god-tier shitpost\n\nIts a shietpost.\n\nMade me laugh though\n{{sticker:sg-miss-fortune}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Warlord Rhinark","date":"2018-09-18T06:54:30.894+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just buy Grievous Wounds you big brute.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Doge2020","date":"2018-09-18T07:56:35.039+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"As a soraka player let me tell you that it is kinda hard and annoying to try hit her q. It requires a bunch of prediction lol. If you got hit by it then it is kinda your fault, use your axe slows to catch up to her or buy a righteous glory too if needed.\n\nOne thing to note: ALWAYS TARGET THE SORAKA FIRST! By targeting one of her teammates you give her the opportunity to heal with ult/w, slow/cc you with q/e or exhaust you. She has no way to escape besides flash and she is squishy as fuck so she is always your priority target when a fight starts.","replies":[{"poster":"theChibiTina","date":"2018-09-19T00:04:11.083+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Plus she can't heal herself unless she lands her Q or uses her ult.

I've dodged plenty of Soraka Qs, but landed a lot myself because people either don't attempt to dodge it or just run straight at me while it's up without taking into consideration that I'm probably gonna Q the spot they're running towards to slow and kite them while I gain health.","replies":[{"poster":"Doge2020","date":"2018-09-19T02:35:53.142+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=theChibiTina,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=NUy3w0ye,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2018-09-19T00:04:11.083+0000)\n>\n> Plus she can&#x27;t heal herself unless she lands her Q or uses her ult.
