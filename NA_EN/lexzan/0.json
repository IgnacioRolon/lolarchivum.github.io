And yesterday my dream came true! Thanks Riot!\n\nI am pleased with his new lore overall, and I appreciate the hard work of the lore team, but I have some questions that I would like to know if you could answer. The question are:\n1.How can Gnar turn into Mega Gnar? \n\n2.What does Gnar have that helps him become something different from how he is?\n\n3.Does Gnar can't remember a thing about his moments while he is Mega and if so, why?\n\n4.Is he still 4 humans years old(without putting the time he was frozen)\n\n5.Did he had someone watching him before he met \"the big white yordles\" or was he on his own from the beginning?\n\nThanks again Riot for showing some love to my favorite furball, and I do hope some of my questions might be answered. I wish everyone has a great day and good luck in your games!","replies":[{"poster":"SkiptoMyLuo","date":"2018-08-29T17:59:03.503+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there! Thank you for taking the time to check out the lore. I'll try my best to answer your questions. Gold Light did a pretty good job!\n\n1. Gnar transforms into Mega Gnar in a very similar way to how he does in game: during emotional highs. Most of the time, this is shown through rage or frustration, but we have much more of Gnar to see and understand, and I imagine he'll continue to surprise all those around him.\n\n2. Gnar's ability to transform into his \"mega\" form is the result of magic. We'll have more yordle lore in the future explaining how magic and yordles go together! \n\n3. Gnar's memory is still akin to that of a very, very young child, so sometimes he can remember moments. Most of the time, not so much. He also often lacks a lot of awareness to what is \"truly\" happening, including the fact that he has transformed.\n\n4. Thinking of his \"maturity\" (or lack thereof) being \"similar\" to that of a 4 yr. old human is still pretty accurate. Like you said, in actual years, Gnar has existed for much longer.\n\n5. Gnar was friendly with many living creatures, human or otherwise. Others may also have taken notice of him, but at the moment, he is more interested in the world around him, filled with wonder at everything new and shiny.","replies":[{"poster":"Flemman","date":"2018-08-29T18:02:47.360+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"is his teasing video still canon tho?

You should always be looking for context, and meaning, and considering who is saying it, when, where and why.\n\nAre Gnar's cave painting any less characterful, just because he is an unreliable source on historical events? Not at all.\n\nDo not lament the loss of truth, where the actual point of the imagery still stands - Gnar believes he protected creatures like him from a big, scary monster. Gnar is \"primitive\", and very young. He draws stuff on walls, and is curious about the world, and himself. All of this can still be considered as true as it ever was.","replies":[{"poster":"Chromatic Eagle","date":"2018-08-31T13:59:11.805+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think we're miscommunicating. I don't assume a piece of information is unreliable until there's a reason to. Characters can lie, have a bias, be misinformed, and so on, but if everything in a story is like that, how can I be invested in it? It's like saying I shouldn't trust anything Dumbledore says because he might be under a spell by Voldermort. If that's the standard moving forward, I don't think I can be into the setting. There are people who can't get into comic books because they're afraid the parts they like will be retconned. That's what I'm feeling right now.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Gnart Even Close","date":"2018-08-29T18:39:05.059+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So Gnar drew the cave paintings?

I appreciate your time and insight. I have more questions if you don't mind!\n\nIn the old lore people said that Anivia froze Gnar to fight against the watchers in the future times. But in the new lore its not clear but it sounds like Lissandra froze Gnar on accident? Is this so?\n\nI liked the idea of Anivia freezing Gnar to have him help in the future because it gave Gnar a big role in the universe of the game. Do you still have any ideas for story roles he could have?\n\nI look forward to hearing more of your insights.

It seems to imply that he got the power from hanging around the yetis (aka \"white yordles\") since their forms are somewhat fluid, but that's just a guess at best. It's definitely likely that he doesn't remember his transformations though, if only because he's flying into a state of blind, animalistic rage. It's possible Gnar is VAGUELY aware of when he transforms, but he's still mentally a kid, so probably doesn't think much of it. If something scary attacks him, Gnar just beasts out, deals with the problem, turns back, and goes on his merry way.\n\nAs for age... I don't think he's four years old anymore since yordles have really long life spans now, but he's definitely, as stated above, still a child.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Frosttz","date":"2018-08-31T23:16:54.926+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey i want to drop another question pertaining to Gnar's old life, specifically on the stuff he hunts.\n\n1. Is Gnar's skull hat one of the hunting trophies he acquired or did he pick it up off somewhere?\n\n2. What kind of things did he hunt, does he eat them? And if he does, does he know how to atleast cook or does he eat them raw?\n\n3. Is Gnar's boomerang kept sharp or does he throws it bluntly at his prey?\n\n4. How long did it take him to track the yetis\n\n5.
