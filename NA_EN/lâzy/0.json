I fiddled with the client a bit bt it did not get better. My champion would also not respond quickly and moved with quick jerking movements, sometimes he would teleport very short distances.  It sounds like lag but according to the client I have 52 ms and 60 FPS. In addition everything except my champ and camera seemed to be moving fine. It is freaking me out and I haven't been able to locate a relevant thread or solution. \r\n\r\nThank you for any help you can provide.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-03T03:13:03.752+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is this still happening or this been resolved since you posted this?
