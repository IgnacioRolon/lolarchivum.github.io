We started to frequently duo or team together, always playing {{champion:222}}  and {{champion:412}} bot lane. Since meeting, we&#039;ve had promise rings with &quot;duo queued&quot; inscribed inside of them to honor our meeting place.\n\nNow we&#039;ve advanced to the next level. We&#039;re looking at engagement rings, but I&#039;ve always imagined our wedding to be League themed with the cute figurines as our wedding cake toppers, etc. I&#039;d like to see if there was a Riot employee who could preform our marriage, but support can&#039;t help. They said only the boards can!\n\nSo here we are, please upvote to get Riot&#039;s attention!!! I think it&#039;d be really fitting to be married by a Riot employee after dedicating so much time and relationship to this game!!\n\nEdit: Gotta get Phreak's attention :) I did tweet at him with this board post link, would love if others helped get him to see this post!!!!\n\nLove APoet &lt;3\n\nEDIT: As per request, here are my Duo Queue ring pictures :)\n\nhttp://imgur.com/2Ddo8Nv\n\nhttp://imgur.com/KCAKpim","replies":[{"poster":"General Esdeath ","date":"2016-05-10T15:59:17.836+0000","up_votes":102,"down_votes":1,"body":"All in favor of Phreak as the Minister/Priest?","replies":[{"poster":"Dextix LT","date":"2016-05-10T16:11:17.902+0000","up_votes":25,"down_votes":0,"body":"Imagine all the puns.....","replies":[{"poster":"DarkRitual","date":"2016-05-10T17:27:47.813+0000","up_votes":71,"down_votes":0,"body":"In sickness, and in death timers.","replies":[{"poster":"APoetCalledLove","date":"2016-05-11T01:42:32.136+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll have to add that to my vows :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"APoetCalledLove","date":"2016-05-10T16:48:26.589+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would approve, I like the puns XD","replies":[{"poster":"Dextix LT","date":"2016-05-10T17:10:43.309+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or just think about it, the groom, the bride and the Priest - The ultimate triforce, puns of damage initiated.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Sargonas","date":"2016-05-10T22:22:04.613+0000","up_votes":44,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would pay in a hearrtbeat to get him ordained!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-05-10T19:27:05.389+0000","up_votes":54,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey! \n\nFirst off, congratulations! ^-^ \n\nSomeone had tweeted out to me asking about this.

For our centerpieces, since the tables are named after champions, the flowers in the center have accents of the champion. So, Teemo has a Teemo shroom in the center, Lux has her staff, Morgana has her shield, etc. Depending on your colors, Thresh lanterns could be awesome - you could even base them off a skin if the base doesn't match your color scheme. ;) Wards may also make sweet centerpieces (that was originally my idea).\n\nI'm also contemplating walking up the aisle to Quinn & Valor's theme. We have a ton of awesome music that you may consider incorporating as well! \n\nOur vows have 'never one without the other' included, too, haha. \n\nAnd thanks!

For the cake, we're going a bit more traditional in terms of style, but are still considering some kind of cake topper.

I highly suggest theknot.com for planning - they suggest all kinds of vendors, and show you the top rated/ones that have won awards. They also offer a killer wedding checklist. ^-^ \n\n> It really is, I hope to see pictures of your wedding when it happens as well, for more inspiration :)\n\nI can certainly post wedding pictures! In the meantime, have some engagement photos - \n\nhttps://scontent-lax3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/t31.0-8/10924192_10152473209856353_7936400669653127570_o.jpg\n\nhttps://scontent-lax3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/t31.0-8/10580731_10152473209826353_8573942903300320616_o.jpg","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Jack º","date":"2016-05-10T19:33:52.838+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"OML When your fav rioter says they're getting married!
