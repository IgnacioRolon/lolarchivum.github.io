My friends have played league of legends for quite a while, and recently Ive been tempted to try it out. I've played two games, and naturally, im already at about diamond 3 elo. Are there any tips you guys can give me that will help me really begin to grasp  the general basics of the game. Im new to mobas, and new to master-race gaming really. Any and all tips/memes would be appreciated. Thanks and have a nice day.\r\n\r\n-huntsskanks42","replies":[{"poster":"Ashen Rider","date":"2017-02-24T01:48:50.832+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Try out a bunch of different champions until you find one that you like. Then play them over and over again until you get good at them, and branch out from there. Try to keep a small pool of champs that you consistently play though, so you can improve. Try to main only one or two roles as well.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-24T01:02:21.214+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First off, welcome to League! :)\n\nWe've consolidated a lot of the basics of League in our [**New Player Guide**](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/new-player-guide).
