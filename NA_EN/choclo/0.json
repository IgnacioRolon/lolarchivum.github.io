I am not sure what bug is causing this. It's annoying that I have to re log in after every match.\r\n\r\nAlso, the invites won't properly display unless I play around with the LoL client, trying to get it selectable.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-15T04:52:44.213+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you're experiencing an overall *poor connection* to the PvP.net service, which ties with social and matchmaking services.
