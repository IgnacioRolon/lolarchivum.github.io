Because he takes a long time to ramp up and most games are over then, and even when you do get to late game, he's been nerfed to where he doesn't do much.\n\npick a champ you can steamroll with, you have to, to get out of that elo. Assasins, trynd, riven, darius, swain, vlad, even garen are all better options, you steamroll lane then help your team get rift and play around the map.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DJMason88","date":"2017-08-03T02:20:09.825+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Buy control wards, and use them. They will help out a lot, if you're top place and blue side place it in the bush that's running along the wall, if you're red side place it in the tri-bush, use your trinket for the rest. This makes sure that if you harrass them when they try to clear it you can retreat to your tower, and it will probably last longer. Vision wins games, especially on gangplank because he has no mobiliy or hard cc, making him vulnerable to ganks, same with Sion, but a little less so. Stare at your mini-map. \n\nBuy {{item:2031}}, it saves you a lot of gold (which is important on Gangplank) from buying pots every back and you can upgrade it to {{item:2033}} later. \n\nTry to get 100 cs by at least 15 minutes if you can, 15 minions is equal to 1 kill. You might want to practice csing on champs you play a lot, it might help, go into practice tool and just farm with autos for a while to get a feel for the champs auto attacks. \n\nDon't try to do crazy LC$ Big Playzz, it probably won't work.  Especially as the midlaner, who often think they are the main character in the anime and that they are the team captain who must flash in and ult to make the winning play (I'm very guilty of this). \n\nIf you're facing a hard matchup (Say Riven, Fiora or Pantheon) don't try to kill them unless you are 100% sure you can. Just be very passive and try to freeze the lane close to your tower, and outscale them. As Gangplank, use your ult around the map to pick up kills and assists so they will fall behind you. \n\nIf you see 2 people arguing, mute both of them and wait 5 minutes. Unmute them and see if they shut up. If they don't and it escalated, report them after and mute them again. Saves you from being tilted. \n\nAfter every game, analyze it to see how you won or how you lost. Find the cause, and either fix it if you lost or do it more if you won. \n\nAfter a loss, take at least a 30 minute break to relax.\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"thecoolzole","date":"2017-08-03T02:23:58.524+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh yeah im very fond of the \"I am bjerg-faker-dopa guy I can 1v5\", but I tend to be a bit safer during team fights...sometimes.
