I have many girls starting many conversations with me. They give me their numbers, I don&#039;t even have to ask them for their numbers.\r\nGirls are attracted to me. They initiate all the conversations and we have hours and hours of talking and getting to know each other.\r\n\r\nbut........\r\n\r\nI have no friends. I told you guys that I have many girls giving me their numbers. I don&#039;t consider these girls that gives me their numbers my friends because I have no social skills. Why don&#039;t I have social skills? because I have no friends. Having no friends is detrimental to one&#039;s self because you don&#039;t know basic social skills or gestures. You don&#039;t know how to start, maintain, and end a conversation. I let these girls initiate conversations because I do not know how to start a conversation. That&#039;s why I am socially awkward because all my conversation starts very random. They just come out of no where.\r\n\r\nIt&#039;s fucking sad, how I am high elo and have the mechanics of faker but I have no friends, no social life, and a loner.\r\nA high elo, native loner...... EDIT: (naive)\r\n\r\nI always question how people that are more socially awkward and weird than me can have friends.\r\n\r\nI am not even social awkward, I am just native because I need to learn at the same pace of a 5 year old trying to socialize and converse with adults.\r\n\r\nHow I act in public, I just act myself in public, and I am very quiet like I like to keep things to myself.","replies":[]}
