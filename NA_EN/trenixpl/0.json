You clearly don't know what you're talking about at all. The entire game is based off of RNG. Every single match, you have to adjust your plan and figure out what you can do better. You shouldn't be focusing on a single build every match you play. If you're not versatile, you're going to lose. Sure you can look up the best build and try to pull it off and it may work because of how imbalanced the game is currently, which it's most likely going to change in the future.

Yes, you have to switching up your plan and learn to adapt for the best outcome with what you're dealt, but knowing what ways to adapt, and again what champions build into what comps or what items combine into, is just game knowledge. It's not something that should take a considerable amount of time in game after you've learned it.\nI didn't say to focus on one build every match, I'm not sure how you got that from what I wrote.\n\nMy point was total game length is already pretty damn long, lengthening the time you have for things that frankly you don't need the time for after you have a little experience with the game mode doesn't make sense. If you're running out of time because you're frantically looking up what champs fit into a comp or what you can build with the items you have, that's a problem with your planning and game knowledge.

That means there are so many factors you have to take into account because everything you planned may just fall apart. Now I'm assuming you don't play this way. You probably just randomly put together items, champs, and just work with whatever goes. That can win some games, but it wont win most. I'm a perfectionist and win plenty of games for this reason.\n\nYou're saying there is something wrong with my planning, but honestly by what you're saying, you don't even plan. You may have general knowledge of the game and then you just button mash. That's great, but some people want more out of the game than that. Just like actual chess, someone plans steps ahead, while the other just moves their piece as soon it's their turn. Guess who is more likely to win? But keep thinking I don't know how to play, whatever makes you feel better. Something tells me its the other way around. I just personally don't like racing against the clock because I actually plan ahead.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Illabethe","date":"2019-07-12T22:47:44.572+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I have time to tab out and look at a chart.

You're right though, this game is an abomination and it's potentially in the worst developers hands in existence. Riot never made a solid and balanced game. They simply throw stuff in the pot, mix it up, and hope it works. This is why I quit LoL years ago. Also there are plenty of other autochess games out there that do everything far better, yet currently this game looks potentially the best. Riot even made little legends be a gamble. I sent plenty of feedback for this game, but it's often unheard and criticized by casuals who simply button mash and think they're good.\n\nHonestly I'm not going waste my time anymore. I hope more companies begin to compete and take TFT out of the picture. Sure luck will always exist, but players who know the mechanics, should have an advantage. Yet playing those mechanics is difficult when there is no time to take advantage of them. Bet many of these kids don't even get past 50+ gold in a match or go on winning streaks, but yet they rage when they lose to someone they think \"got lucky\".","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"The Last Padawan","date":"2019-07-12T23:08:47.559+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Please, NO.
