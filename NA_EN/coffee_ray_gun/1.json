I like being able to occasionally get on the boards and spend 30+min without getting a headache unlike the forums.\n\nI do think they should make at least 1 option that flips the scheme back to lighter if that's someone's prefereance.

As it is now I believe the boards are actually too dark with the text too bright which hurts my eyes. If you add on the fact the boards background/colors are rather gloomy/depressing I just can't see myself being here much. I'll try to adjust, but to the best of my knowledge you are the only person that \"likes\" the new colors.\n\nHappy trails,\nSteinustine.","replies":[]}]}
