I was playing ahri mid and he was playing master yi jungle. my ping was higher than usual, about 80 ms when i usually have 40 so it was harder for me to dodge zed's qs. so I got solo killed once. then i decided to forfeit cs and xp to help my botlane out getting them a double kill. I died again in lane because i got ganked, and both of these times my friend told me to stop inting. \r\n\r\nnow he was complaining in chat too. whining because our support Braum accidentally took 2 kills. he would also constantly blame me in chat, saying we were losing because i decided to play with lags (even though it wasn't so laggy, it just affected my skillshots and the ability to dodge them...)  and just generally making me not wanna play anymore. he was very negative the whole game, he is often like this when the game is not going his way.\r\n\r\nSo after the game I decided to report him for Negative Attitude and Verbal abuse.  That was yesterday.\r\n\r\nToday he was permanently suspended, just 5 days after returning to the account after a 2 week suspension. I did not get an instant feedback report so I know it was not my report that triggered the ban. he had 1 other game in his logs that he was banned for. he claims he was just telling his top laner to stop trolling and that the rest was jibberish but i dont know what he said because he refused to send me the full chat logs.\r\n\r\nmy question is, Was i in the right here? I was very upset by what he said in game. he also insults me outside of game too, calling me things like overweight, e-girl trash, I get carried all the time and that's why my winrate is so good, and that no one would ever want to go out with me (even though i have a girlfriend myself...)\r\n\r\nanyway that is all besides the point. \r\n\r\nShould I have let him be and not reported him? I kind of ruined this friendship that lasted so long. if i had not reported him i think he wouldve gotten banned eventually anyway because of how toxic he is in his losing games..when he is winning he is nice but when losing he is just so toxic. I have seeked (suck? sook?) advice on reddit before for help with my awful mentality and mentioned my friend in this threads. almost everyone recommended that I delete him immediately. \r\n\r\nmy other good friend also kept telling me to delete him. that he is a kid and he can't get out of silver with his mentality. \r\n\r\ni was already having some bad depression because of exams...but this just made it worse...can anyone at least reassure me that i did the right thing? cuz i really dont know what to think anymore","replies":[{"poster":"Umbral Regent","date":"2019-06-19T20:59:21.152+0000","up_votes":76,"down_votes":0,"body":"> my question is, Was i in the right here?

If he was being toxic and upsetting you through flame, underhanded remarks, etc., you were well within the right to report him. Him getting a permanent suspension just showed that he hadn't learned from his 14-day ban, and just got what was ultimately coming to him.\n\n> I kind of ruined this friendship that lasted so long.\n\nFrankly, I think your friendship with him ended when he decided to call you \"e-girl trash\" amongst other things; he ain't much of a friend if he's ready to insult you and flame you like he did, both in and out of game.\n\n> can anyone at least reassure me that i did the right thing?\n\nYou did do the right thing, and I agree with your other good friend.

Not even considering the grief he put you through, he was making the game worse for random strangers and violated the code of conduct.\n\nI’d be very hesitant to stop talking to him just because random people on the internet told you too. We don’t know and can’t really judge the relationship. My advice would be to stop talking with him or spend less time talking with him if he is verbally abusive. It is impossible to spend a lot of time with someone without them impacting you so spend time with good people (or at least some time). Also, if you want to continue being his friend, tell him what you think he’s doing wrong. It can be awkward to have such candid conversations, but he may be a bit blinded to his own wrong doings (perhaps his insults were intended to be more lighthearted smack talk without realizing that he was hurting people etc.) and/or may go out of his way to change or at least act more appropriately around you.","replies":[{"poster":"Thunder Dreamss","date":"2019-06-20T03:45:38.180+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm going to very much second this.

I don't think you did the right thing and I don't think you suffered any \"abuse\" from this person, you should hear how guys talk to each other and banter over vidya.  UwU Ur no git GF lulzor.  Pfffffffffft.\n\nmy question is, Was i in the right here? I was very upset by what he said in game. he also insults me outside of game too, calling me things like overweight, e-girl trash, I get carried all the time and that's why my winrate is so good, and that no one would ever want to go out with me (even though i have a girlfriend myself...)","replies":[{"poster":"CarpeConundrum","date":"2019-06-20T12:41:56.806+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":6,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Yuumi or Dodge","date":"2019-06-20T13:24:25.365+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"what are you talking about? i was asking for advice because i was so shaken after what happened.  and yes, I'm playing support, of course I'm going to \"get carried\"...also remember that this isn't my only account.

It's extremely underhanded and a PERFECT EXAMPLE OF WHY I DON'T LIKE WOMEN IN GAMING.  Because holding any opinion or any position that is counter to the position or opinions of women is automatically sexist.  \nIf I say that women have, objectively, ruined both the AAA and indie development industries, you'll call me sexist no matter what evidence I offer (this isn't the thread for that but I could go on for hours) and that's what has ruined gaming in my opinion.  You women can screech \"sexism, sexism, sexism\" and shut down anyone who says anything you don't like, even when it's just an opinion like mine.  I never said women shouldn't or couldn't play video games, all I said was I prefer not to play games with women and that makes me a sexist somehow.  THIS IS WHY I HATE WOMEN IN GAMING!!!

The right to free association means that we have the right to freely disassociate from any individual or group we want to.  \nI prefer to be around my own people.  I don't think this makes me racist anymore than not wanting to share 100% of my time with women.  I want one fucking hobby where I don't have to deal with women.  Our grandparents had work, our parents had clubs and lodges, growing up I *had* video games and table top RPGs.  Now I have nowhere.  I don't like mixed groups of men and women.  It's inevitable that any group with both men and women will eventually unravel as men start competing with each other for female attention and women spur on the drama.  Every single discord server, every single teamspeak server, every irl group I've ever been apart of has been torn apart by women.  The problem is, or one of the problems is, that you can't treat women like equals despite that being the demand.  If OP were a dude I'd have insulted him and told him to grab his balls, but I said (more or less) the same thing to this female and you jumped in to white knight for her. The only reason she announced herself as a female in the first place is because she knew that people like you would defend her and shield her if anyone like *me* came into this thread to tell her to grow up.\n\nIt's inevitable and happens everywhere, previously mentioned discords, TS's and irl groups.  Women act in such a way as to provoke male responses and if anyone tries to patrol their behaviour, people like you white knight.  This is why I don't like women in gaming.  This is why I don't like women in any of my hobbies.\n\nI am not a racist for not enjoying the company of blacks your edit was bad and you should feel bad.  \nI am not sexist for not enjoying the company of women.","replies":[{"poster":"EvilDustMan","date":"2019-06-20T18:10:29.699+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=CarpeConundrum,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=cRgyM3ax,comment-id=00220001000000010000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2019-06-20T17:49:09.186+0000)\n>\n> No, not really.
