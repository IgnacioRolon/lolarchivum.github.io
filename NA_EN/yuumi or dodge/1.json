But I want to change that.\r\n\r\nBack when i only had a few bans, I talked back to people who flamed me and nothing else. I used to almost be like a deer in headlights, talking back to flamers but never insulting them before I would report them. Back then I was Bronze 3, I was awful at the game, I got flamed every single game I played, by allies and enemies alike. Every game. I didn't know there was a mute function back then. And I believe my habit of flaming was simply born from being harrassed and insulted every single game I played. Some grow thick skin, but I just grew the balls to fight back, and eventually flame others.\r\n\r\nEnough with that. What provokes my flaming is when my jungler is truly useless.  When I get ganked 7 times in 10 minutes, and my jungler is farming his raptors while I'm being towerdived without a single care in the world. That's what puts me on tilt and when I'm on tilt I start to talk trash. I wanna have fun with this game but it's getting difficult like this. \r\n\r\nMaybe you'll think, \"Just mute all! Just disable your enter key!\"\r\n\r\nMute all doesn't stop me typing to people. And, what is the point of disabling my enter key? sure, I won't run a risk of losing my account. But I will probably still tilt, and probably afk since I am very bad at handling pent up frustration. even if I'm not able to talk, I bet that I will end up removing the restriction in a fit of anger and bring everything down on myself.\r\n\r\nA simple keybinding or command won't fix my mental. that's the real problem here. I feel a sick anxiety before even queuing up for a game. something that shouldnt be associated with a video game. can anybody help me?","replies":[{"poster":"GatekeeperTDS","date":"2019-06-23T15:53:16.073+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"> What provokes my flaming is when my jungler is truly useless.\n\nThis is your problem right here, and since you're young, let an old man lecture you for just a couple minutes. :)\n\nThis isn't something you're going to have to deal with in just League, this is a life thing, and it's going to happen in many different kinds of scenarios. It's somewhere between \"mind your own business\" (doesn't really apply, because it's a team game) and \"not my monkeys, not my circus.\" You're focusing on someone else and their performance instead of your own, and whether you believe it or not, this is harming your **own** performance. Every second of time and every ounce of attention you're giving to what you **think** this other person should be doing, is distracting you from your own goals and harming your team as well. This is the kind of thing that will get you fired from a job IRL.\n\nNow, I'll come at this from a point of agreement that \"the jungler was shit\" even though that might not be the case. If the jungler is shit, you can't do anything about it. Not a single thing. And as you've discovered, **you've** been punished for the way you've handled this situation. Same thing if this were a job. If you're so focused on a coworker's performance that your own performance is suffering, you're going to lose your job. It's your manager's job to deal with that other coworker, not you. League games unfortunately have no manager, but the reasoning is the same - you are not your jungler's boss.\n\nTo deal with this and reform? It's not easy. But you can make it easier by separating what's easy from what's hard.\n\nWhat's hard is to control your emotions, pretend to not have them, or suppress them. That's hard and doesn't work. You're allowed to be upset, frustrated, anxious. What you **can** control (and again, life skill here, not just League) is your **REACTIONS** to those emotions. Swear outloud, punch a pillow, get up to take a piss, whatever you can do to not rage at people in-game.\n\n> I feel a sick anxiety before even queuing up for a game. something that shouldnt be associated with a video game.\n\nAs I've told people in other threads, not everyone can thrive in every kind of environment and there's no shame in that. If League makes you sick to your stomach, stop playing League. Free time is a valuable, finite resources that you will eventually run out of, and you owe it to yourself to spend it having fun.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nhika","date":"2019-06-23T15:51:04.395+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"GatekeeperTDS","date":"2019-06-23T15:55:53.620+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dude came here asking for help.

This means that, at any given time, 2-3 players on your team are likely playing worse than they normally do.\n\nAdditionally, your own perception of what is going on in the game is limited by your viewpoint and the things you see. There's often games where I think someone made a stupid move, downloaded the replay, and saw that they noticed something I didn't that would have gotten us both killed, or that I messed up a play a minute earlier that put me in that vulnerable position.\n\nIf you're ganked 7 times in 10 minutes, for example, that's a lane that, as a jungler, I'd ignore -- you're *very* far behind, and it's my job to try to help the team as a whole. I could spend my time on a losing lane to stem the bleeding, or I could try to get myself/others ahead through focusing on other lanes and objective control so we have a stronger team to deal with 1-2 fed champions. In many cases that's the RIGHT call, much as it sucks for the laner who is getting camped. 7 ganks in 10 minutes, however, likely means you also could probably have warded more and played safer.\n\nIt's for this reason that my recommendation is always this: **worry about your own gameplay, not the gameplay of others**. Sometimes, sure, someone else misses something -- but sometimes you (or I, or anyone) misses stuff as well. We can't MAKE other players pay attention to us, but we CAN work on how we can prevent getting ganked, or dying again in lane, or how well we farm under tower, or how well we learn to play while behind. Focus on that stuff and keep your chat limited to planning / encouraging your team, and the game gets a lot less frustrating.\n\nYou can't win them all, and that needs to be something you both understand and are okay with.

According to studies (and please correct me if I'm wrong) there seems to be a stigma in that area against males looking for counseling OR there's a lack of trained counselors in the area. The fact that you're prone to fits of rage could be related to puberty and hormonal imbalance. It could also be a sign of anger management issues. There's also the issue of EUW and the US having different cultures. Riot Games is a US based company and so the TOS and mindset for this game is primarily designed with US culture in mind I think (once again someone correct me if I'm wrong. I don't want to give false information). With that in mind it's possible that the \"grow balls and fight back\" mentality is just a part of your culture. If you want to change your behavior then the best advice that I can give you is...\n\nTry to understand this.\n\nRegardless of what lane you're in - your opponent is the person that gets assigned to the same lane as you. Your job is to perform better than your opponent. How you choose to do that is up to you.\n\nThe same goes for Jungler.\n\nNow the question is - what does \"perform better\" mean? To put it in simplest terms you need to be earning more gold and XP than your opponent. How your team chooses to manage those two currencies is the only difference between winning and losing.\n\n------------------------------------\n\nLet's put this into a scenario.\nYou did not specify your lane. So I'm going to assume that you're a mid laner.\n\n\n\nIn mid lane your opponent is behind. You've traded really well and now your opponent has less HP than you. They're forced to sit at the back of the minion wave and can't farm gold. This player is duoing with jungle. They ask their jungle friend to come assist them. Because they're duoing the jungle friend feels an obligation to assist the mid lane player. Jungle takes his blue buff and comes mid.\n\nWhat should you do?\n--------------------------------------\n\n\n- At this point you should retreat.\n- ping for assistance if you THINK you can take the two champions together.\n- wait for confirmation that assistance is coming\n- wait for the jungle to initiate the engagement\n- follow up from a safe distance\n- back for items if you have the gold\n- return to lane\n- play from your side of the lane because jungler might be camping your lane\n- place a control ward nearby your lane that wont get destroyed to defend against the enemy junglers pathing\n\nif your jungle decides that it's better for him to clear the jungle then try to understand that that is a valid tactic. If the jungler hasn't bought enough items or has already used his blue buff/red buff and doesn't have it going into the fight then it might be better for that jungle to continue to focus earning XP and gold in their side of the jungle. If your team knows where the enemy jungler is then your jungler knows which camps to take. Beyond that there are some champions like shyvanna and ivern that have to focus the jungle and they do it extremely well. In these instances it's very likely that the enemy jungler is losing his camps and is being forced into a lane. It's your job as the laner to continue to entice that jungler to come to your lane. If you can do that without dying then he will fall behind and be unable to contest epic monsters.\n\nBy reading into your complaint I have envisioned a scenario where you're playing as... {{champion:136}} and you're against a {{champion:45}} +{{champion:19}} \n\ni imagine that your jungler is someone like... {{champion:77}} \n\nat the beginning of the game even if your jungler chooses to ignore the 2v1 scenario that was created on the enemies team it's still your job as the mid laner to not die. If you're scared of getting dived then buy zhonyas, gargoyle stoneplate, warmogs, rylias, rod of ages, banshees veil, archangel staff,  proto belt or glp-800, locket of the iron solari, zz rot, randuins omen, redemption, reverie, steraks gage, sunfire cape, thornmail etc. if you're fearful that you wont be able to run away then just buy something that will help you not die. builds need to be flexible.\n\nOne thing about Sol is that he's immobile. He doesn't have a dash, a flash, a blink, etc. So you need to build with that in mind. If an enemy can get on top of you then you're dead.

My jungler was {{champion:82}}. The enemy mid and jungle were {{champion:164}}  and {{champion:61}} . Camille had ganked me twice before my jungelr had even finished his second camp, and there was little I could do since I had to get so close to the wave in order to farm.  Felt like there was nothing I could've done and my adc constant flaming and pinging only tilted me more.\n\nOkay so let me address this specific scenario.\n\nAs Sol you're going to lose lane against orianna. That's a fact. You have no way to deal enough damage to her and her ball's range outranges your Q's range and your extended W. Since you're immobile all she has to do is sit her ball on you and press all of her buttons for an easy kill. In this scenario and with many other scenarios similar to this one you're going to want to build zz'rot. It will help keep you from dying and provide you with a way to farm the minion wave from a safe distance. The fact that Camille was there of course did not help the matter, but Mordekaiser would have done poorly against her in a 1v1 even if he used his R. Mordekaiser's Q only works if the opponent is singled out. The insane amounts of shields and damage that that combo can deal to an unprepared player is pretty drastic.\n\nCamille is a world class diver and isolater. More than likely these two were indeed duoing for the synergy of their champs as those are unusual champions to see played. Even if mordekaiser had came mid he could not have helped you.\n\nDuring this duo mid camping you your best bet would have been to stay out of camilles lunge range. Her hookshot lunge is how she sets up her dives. Eventually had she stayed in the lane without getting a kill she would have had to make the choice to return to the jungle starved or continue to starve her mid laner. it's fine if you dont get any gold for the first 10 minutes of the game as long as you're getting xp and not dying. eventually you will outscale a duo lane as a solo lane. they also have to back to buy items and when that happens you'll have a lane to yourself. meanwhile your team is going to be outscaling and out farming those two players.\n\nthis is really just a miscalculation on your part and there was nothing to flame your allies over - nor should they have flamed you for dying as it's hard to stay alive as sol 2v1. That's the downside of the champion you've picked to main. He's DPS and not burst. You have to build him so he can take a beating and still dish out damage.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Madjack01","date":"2019-06-23T16:56:44.997+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=BLACK REALM GOD,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=fQBqp9Aj,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2019-06-23T16:24:56.389+0000)\n>\n> I noticed that your account is on the EUW servers. According to studies (and please correct me if I'm wrong) there seems to be a stigma in that area against males looking for counseling OR there's a lack of trained counselors in the area.\n\nMaybe a bit off topic, but I've studied and worked in the field if criminology and depending on what science you call home there is a stigma against psychology and counseling people (not just males)\n\nThere is a lame joke we like to tell: \"A psychologist can change a light bulb,but only if that light bulb wants to be changed.\" Not to say that that psychology often gets laughed at as a wannabe science.\n\nThere is also no unity that says that pure counseling actually works if a person couldn't have changed through their own will anyways.\n\nPersonally I believe much of that stems from the fact that counseling people is not a standalone thing to do, but rather a cog that needs to work together with other cogs in the great machine of change.

The goal is to play to the best of your abilities and improve. You get ganked a million times and your jungler/team doesn't do anything to take advantage of that? Well, your chances to win just plummeted, but that's fine. You 're not focussed on winning, you're focussed on personally doing the best with every situation. It's important that you can say that you tried to do everything right given the circumstances, even if that means not having much fun. \n\nA lot of frustration comes from people trying to control everything. Your team sucks, they react toxic to every advice you give; it's hard not to feel  a sense of helplessness. That's a feeling we all hate and try to avoid (sometimes through flaming or rationalizing it away).\n\nYou can alleviate that by shifting your focus away from winning (which is not entirely in your control) and towards what you can control: your gameplay.\n\nNot that it's easy, but maybe this approach can help you in at least a little way.","replies":[]},{"poster":"thepowerlies","date":"2019-06-23T20:09:29.793+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"best way to reform is to stop playing this game lol","replies":[]},{"poster":"C9 Aphrolift","date":"2019-06-23T16:26:16.540+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Yuumi or Dodge,realm=EUW,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=fQBqp9Aj,comment-id=,timestamp=2019-06-23T15:42:47.183+0000)\n>\n> A simple keybinding or command won't fix my mental. that's the real problem here.
