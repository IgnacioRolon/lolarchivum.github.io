I've recently orchestrated an experiment where I've created 10 different accounts, raised them all to level 30 and entered ranked. 77-100% of games engaged upon on 10 accounts (each played  25 games) Were a loss due to individuals who've either purposely destroyed the game due to not getting their lane, not getting their champion, and even because another player didn't play his/her champ the way another individual wanted them to. Majority of those games I was reported due to being camped, dived, or for no reason at all by the same people who cursed out the team, raged, and insulted anyone if not everyone.  Hopefully riot will create a more constructive way to penalize those who purposely ruin the game for others.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Whiskies","date":"2015-12-21T23:18:21.064+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":6,"body":"Rioter grrrlee here.

For me, I have never been the type to pay for things in F2P's, because I'm super cheap （˶′◡‵˶） And from my own experiences, League is the only game where I didn't feel like people shelling out real monehs were getting ahead. Before I became a Rioter, I didn't spend one penny in-game because that's not my style. Instead, I appreciated that I could hoard IP to buy champs and runes. It didn't really bother me to not have pretty skins, since they gave me no real advantage during gameplay.\n\nI suppose that's one of the things that really spoke to me about Riot Games. Unlike other F2P's I had played, Riot seemed to care first about player experience, not about forcing people to cough up cash for superior items, extended playtime, or whatever. I never even felt pressured to buy skins because there were no aggressive marketing tactics.\n\nMaybe there are other F2P's with the same model, I'm not trying to discount them or their efforts at all. I just happen to really appreciate what I have seen Riot do, and I am happy to be a part of this team.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Sciela,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=rZ0nF4y7,comment-id=00060008,timestamp=2015-12-22T06:19:56.859+0000)\n>\n> Though, I know you're just Riot's PR person to make the company seem like it's not just a bunch of suits humping their wallets, so I don't blame you.\n\nYanno, I've considered going into PR before, but sometimes I'm just not the right type for it... at times I prefer quiet and solitude in my work.

I have only recently started to lurk these boards, and I can't but find it a little disheartening that so many people seem to believe we do not care about players. I have to keep reminding myself that these Boards are not the most accurate representation of the player base. (◞‸◟；)\n> \n> As a part of this company, I have never felt that it has focused on anything other than Players [that means you and me]. In fact, it's the only thing in our mission statement, and a huge part of our manifesto [ see: http://www.riotgames.com/riot-manifesto ]. People here _really do_ aspire to be _player-focused_, as much as we are able. We are gamers; we play LoL often and can feel the player pain as much as the rest of you. I've been a part of companies that are driven solely by marketing -- bombarding customers with annoying promotional/sale emails, selling information to all bidders, scheming on how to milk every penny. I left my last job to come to Riot because this attitude didn't sit well with me, and I could see how it was affecting our customers. I have not once seen a major focus on eCommerce or marketing, and that is one of the things that I appreciate most about working here.\n> \n> If you don't believe that we are focusing on certain issues that really matter to you, you may be right. But it's prolly because there are so many other issues jumping up all over the place. The things we choose to work on, and what we ultimately end up doing, is determined by a mixture of research, data, player feedback, and our own instincts/emotions as gamers ourselves. We cannot possibly make everyone happy about everything all at the same time, but I honestly feel that this company is approaching things as correctly as possible.\n> \n> More on topic with OP: decimatetheweak, if you have documented your research, I would love to see it and even possibly share it with others here at Riot. Toxicity is something we are striving to battle better all the time, and maybe your work can help us improve. I appreciate your passion for this issue!\n\nI know your new here and I am sorry to throw you under the bus but certain statements you made here irk me to no end so I am not going to hold back.  #1 this board is actually a VERY accurate representation of the player base, you ( RIOT ) foolishly tend to believe its not and is part of why you have alot of the issues you do have. Broken champions, toxicity running rampant STILL years later, players complaining about trolls because honestly nothing is done. Bot accounts still getting to gold and getting rewards for doing it ( dont say it doesnt happen because I know of an account that did exactly this and got away with it.) taking away rewards from aug 10th to aug 17th and hurting the few that might had one ban the entire season but rewarding the ones who had bans for several months. I mean this list can go on and on and on and on with how terribly bad your company u THINK is doing good is. I mean ill keep going for real ... you still charge premium prices for skins that are 2+ years old the rune system is still prehistoric. Thunderlords is broken beyond belief and you guys think that its balance. Zed and other good champions recieve buffs while others lay in the dirt for 2 years. Your reworks are mostly crap some outright fail. Scripters are everywhere. trolls can still go 0-20 and not get punished. TRIBUNAL has been gone for like 2 years even tho it wasnt supposed to be gone that long. Replay mode was promised and never delivered. Players have begged for a sandbox mode to no avail. Players warn you of op stuff in the pbe forums but are instead ignored and champions come out of pbe still in their broken state. \n\nI mean can you REALLY defend that ? I think RIOT misinformed you.\n\n#2 on your second statement you speak about marketing ... you are now owned by tencent its only a matter of time.\n\n#3 on your last part about striving to battle toxicity again you blindly aim for the wrong root of the problem... the trolls are the ones you need to aim at first as the first step of ending toxicity. If players actually TRIED and put effort into winning a game it would curb alot of this issue. Then you need to target the remaining toxic players who continue to be toxic despite the trolls no longer being around to create the toxic environement in the first place.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Whiskies","date":"2015-12-23T05:22:52.956+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Apologies in advance that I cannot address everything; I really wish I had all the answers and could divulge all the informations.

Do car manufacturers make sure the drivers of their vehicles are roadrage-less, law-abiding consumers? Are computer/parts companies responsible for the actions of hackers? Do the makers of Settlers of Catan make sure that I am not scowling at my friends and flipping tables when someone puts the freakin' knight on my land? I know these are imperfect analogies, but they are thoughts I've had when wondering about the precedence of dealing with customer behavior.\n\nIn my gaming experience with random players, I have never really seen good implementation of combatting toxicity, and I think Riot Games is doing a great job in paving the way. Yes, there's a lot of experimenting and failing, but I hope people can see that there is some good that has come out of it as well.

On the other hand, Riot the company seems exceedingly focused on SR esports. Developments to that end are well done, but everything else is seemingly deemed unworthy. If a particular player actually is interested in SR esports, then things are great. However, if they're not (such as being a non-SR player), their grievances are simply ignored for years.

But recently after I've realized it's the repetitive, futile, inevitable experience, I figured I would do my own research, spend more of my time identifying the persistent issue, and spread it across my own website for the sake of other players as riot isn't of my concern, I'm more after providing other players with a voice that can and WILL be heard.","replies":[{"poster":"Mecha KhaZix","date":"2015-12-22T06:23:36.778+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey man, I just want you to back up your claims with evidence.","replies":[{"poster":"decimatetheweak","date":"2015-12-26T09:33:03.893+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you have any concept of hard work? Spend almost a year of your time constructing an experiment and then begin to be harassed about exploiting it by demanding biased extremest and then begin to explain to me why you feel as if you're not obligated to share your information. It's simply rude to demand something you're not beginning to want to believe to start with. I could spill 7 months of dialog unto this blog and I GUARANTEE people are still going to deny and demand it's inconclusive and fabricated. The obvious truth here is simple. Majority of you are perceivers so regardless of what I say, you're all obsessed with proving something wrong instead of embracing it and finding compromise and resolution. I'm a psychology major, I'm not going to waste my time on a handful of people whose idea of logic is to deny everything other than what they personally believe.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
