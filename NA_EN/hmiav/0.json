I created a new account on the EUW account, but have been experiencing very frequent lag spikes in my games on the EUW server. My internet speed is good, and the ping on both the NA and EUW servers are around 30-50 ms. I am using a laptop instead of my PC back in the US, but my laptop should still be able to handle games like LoL. Anyone else experienced something similar? Maybe there's some graphical setting that affects the FPS significantly?\r\n\r\nMuch love and happy holidays!","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-20T03:45:21.374+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since you're using a laptop, you may also be using WiFi, which has historically caused a *ton of issues* with League and your latency (ping). There are a number of network configurations that can be problematic for League so I recommend working through our [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to ensure those settings are all in line. \n\nPlease let me know if you continue to experience latency issues after taking those steps.","replies":[{"poster":"HMIAV","date":"2016-12-20T07:04:42.605+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah thank you.
