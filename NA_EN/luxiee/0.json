I find myself being paired in matches often with trolls and people who dc and afk constantly. I feel that this has a lot to do with my MMR. I have played thousands of games and am now stuck. It doesn't matter if I go 30-4 with a character. I have often thought about starting over, and creating a new account all together like many people do to start over. I have chosen not to go this route, because over the years my family and friends have gifted me bundles, champions, and skins. I do not want to forsake this account because I can't manage to dig myself out of the crapshoot that is bronze. I desperately want quality play and matches. I am tired of being frustrated with my teams and results of matches because of jerks.\r\n\r\nMy suggestion or question is simply this. Why can't we do a one time reset of our standings. I don't want to lose all of the data like how many games played and such. But why can't we have a one time reset button? I would even pay for it.\r\n\r\nMy frustration stems from the beginning of the season. I go 8/10 and am still in bronze and now I am still in bronze. To be honest, I wouldn't really be all that upset if 80-90% of my losses weren't due to lag, disconnects, and trolls losing matches on purpose (never made much sense to me but ok).\r\n\r\nThank you so much for taking the time to read my post. I hope that something does start changing.","replies":[{"poster":"Darkmind1212","date":"2014-11-05T19:35:53.233+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't mean to say this as a jerk but sorry dude RIOT has shown time and again that they just don't care about people in silver and under rankings. They act as if they are in some very odd denial state and are not able to cope with the fact that it is broken. Sorry dude but after what seems to be 3 years now with the same issue never even being hinted at being fixed. There is no hope in sight for this to ever end.","replies":[{"poster":"Sailor Mint","date":"2014-11-05T19:40:14.658+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They've made changes that made climbing out of Bronze and Silver a lot easier than before.\n\nEnd result is Bronze being barely 25% (from 35%) of the player base and Gold+ increasing to top ~33% (from 25%),","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Luxiee","date":"2014-11-05T19:23:11.943+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am posting this as another added suggestion.  This directly ties into another forum post on this board.  With dealing with AFK and Rage quits.  I believe that players on a team should be able to hit and Urgent button.  So that when a player on your team rage quits or afks the team members could flag the match.  Then a review board can review flagged matches and determine if this match is worthy of a loss prevention.  \n\nYou rarely see rage quits and afks in the higher tiers and this is really an major issue for bronze.  I feel that loss prevention would be greatly utilized by this.  I do not think it is fair to the rest of your team if someone afks in the middle of a match.  This is mostly a respect issue in our community.  If you are not prepared to play the match in it's entirety and put forth effort then maybe a ranked match is not the que for you, but I do believe we should protect the players trying and queing with the intention of moving forward in ranked standings.","replies":[]}]}
