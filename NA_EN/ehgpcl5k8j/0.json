Big changes in latency like you're seeing are typically caused by routing changes at your ISP that change how long a path your connection takes to our servers. Before we take a look at your network routing, I recommend going through our [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) so we can verify all your local settings are 100% compatible with League.\n\nLet me know if this resolved your issue.","replies":[{"poster":"El Pasos Finest","date":"2017-01-09T06:02:13.368+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Still acting like this is an exclusive problem to these 'few' people?
