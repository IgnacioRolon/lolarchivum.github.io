We all now know this is for sure a remake the rest of the team sits in the fountain and we dance and wait for the /remake\r\n\r\nWhen we /remake we get out of game and all of us have leaverbuster punishments and -16 LP.\r\n\r\nWe used the remake system in a normal way...we didnt have a 5th so we waited and remaked.....because we didnt go to lane we all get AFK?? How can the system read it like that....we all bought items stay connected....WE ALL 4 VOTED YES FOR THE REMAKE.\r\n\r\nHOW CAN YOU GET -LP and an AFK WHEN I VOTED FOR THE REMAKE!!!!\r\n\r\nNow i have to wait 20min 5 times to get into a game?\r\nNow in order to chat with friends i cant be in Que or i have to wait for 20min more?\r\nI open and ticket but then i read that...\r\n\r\n\"The LeaverBuster can not FOR ANY REASON be taken off of your account\" \" Because we didn't want it to be corrupt\" \r\n\r\nSo basically you have a robot effectively temp banning people from your game without any way for me to appeal this punishment?\r\n\r\nthis is a grossly unfair system and needs to be changed immediately.  \r\n\r\nBecause of someone else leaving a game and me using /remake correctly I now have to wait in que for a total of 5 x 20 - 120min\r\n\r\n2 hours of no chating while in que and waiting for nothing all because a robot thought i was afk....and no one at Riot will help me with this unfair punishment because its their rules that alll unfair punishments are final robot overlord discussions???\r\n\r\nI want some Answers mods......","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-28T21:15:59.830+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The [/Remake system](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/208754686--Remake-FAQ) marks anyone who is inactive for 90 seconds or more within the first 3 minutes of the game. Because the disconnected player could come back before the match is eligible for a remake, it's a good idea to continue playing the game normally in the event they come back.\n\nIn this case, it sounds like the system may have marked you for being inactive while waiting for the Remake. I hope this clears up the system and situation for you. Let me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"mo0on2","date":"2016-09-23T06:54:49.158+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i just got almost the same thing but i'm not sure if it's from 'remake' or not.. i was in LeaverBuster too but it was my last one,,, after i finished from the game, i got a message saying that i was AFK and i got in LeaverBuster  again!! i didn't even went AFK in this game :(","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tigstk","date":"2016-09-23T05:07:54.733+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its a simple Fix just make it so that \n\nIF I VOTE FOR THE REMAKE THEN IM NOT AFK OR THE LEAVER DONT PUNISH ME.","replies":[]}]}
