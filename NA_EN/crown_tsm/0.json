Please upvote this so Riot can see this messed up situation.  Lux was also being toxic and saying how she wanted us to lose the game.\r\n\r\nHey guys, I am an African American male who got wrongfully banned. I was recently referred to as a \"niggo\" in champion select, and understandingly it really titled me. I wanted to flame the crap out of our mid laner who called me that and banned my champ, but i restrained myself(I did lose a lot of hope in winning the game because we were way down and they were in our base, but the whole team had lost faith and certainly this is not permabannable especially considering the circumstances). I asked the other team to report her for calling me a \"%%%%%%\" (I typed the word out so they could understand the severity of the issue). I assume this is why I ended up getting permabanned. my username is \"jakobe1996\", ign \"crown TSM\". Eng√Øneer is the player who called me a \"niggo\". If you have capability of checking chat logs in champ select, you are easily able to tell. I have been temp banned before, and I have reallly been focusing on being less toxic since then. If i lose my account for this I have to imagine that not only is it messed up in the fact I was the victim(clearly shown by the chat logs) but it will also be a real disappointment to me because I love the game. Please try to get this resolved ASAP so I can get back on the rift.\r\n\r\nChat logs for your reference: \r\nGame 1 \r\nCrown TSM: lol you banning fiora ctually lost us the game \r\nCrown TSM: i would of wrecked him \r\nCrown TSM: plz report lux \r\nCrown TSM: she is trying to lose us the game and she called me a %%%%%% \r\nCrown TSM: im black yes \r\nCrown TSM: more than enough to report \r\nCrown TSM: and she banned my champ \r\nCrown TSM: wow this game is sooo over \r\nCrown TSM: plz end \r\nCrown TSM: not much fun when your mid trolls and bans your champ \r\nCrown TSM: gg","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-11T04:35:50.359+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, it's definitely not okay for someone to be calling others racist comments like that, but it's also not much better to fight back with more intensity either.
