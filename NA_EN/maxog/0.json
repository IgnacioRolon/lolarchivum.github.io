Basically, what I wish I could do is just type \"cdr\" in to the search bar and be able to see all the items that give CDR, or \"hp\" and get likewise. Yes, I know there are catagories on the bottom, but I honestly find them a little tedious to deal with. It doesn't reset the next time you enter the store, so you have to go back and uncheck all the stuff you had before, and I just don't ever have the need to use the list often enough for the order of categories to be stuck in my brain.\n\nJust a little gripe of mine.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Monsieur","date":"2014-07-17T03:09:26.148+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why can't buying another trinket simply replace the current one.","replies":[{"poster":"SerBlaise","date":"2014-07-17T17:07:40.965+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"THIS.

Say if the enemy team has a fed Akali or something.

It's his passive. If it's too strong, tune it down, but it's just a part of the champion like any other ability.\n\nIt is a bit odd that Rengar got his optional item trinket-ified while Viktor's mandatory item still isn't though.\n\nAs for it being a ball of stats, well, I for one was pretty bummed when they didn't keep the unique Rengar ward-traps thing they were doing. How that affects power I don't know but I thought it was far more interesting.","replies":[{"poster":"Cuix","date":"2014-07-19T10:13:03.529+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Except he still as a passive.
