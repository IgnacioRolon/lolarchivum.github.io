I couldn't say for sure, but game stats are not something that can be changed.  The best thing you can do is to resolve whatever is causing you to have interruptions.  I'd be happy to help with that, just let me know what's going on with more details.  Let me know!","replies":[{"poster":"Amarøk","date":"2016-08-31T18:56:22.527+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"i have two friends who were in the game with me and the same votes were also on their screen as well as everyone else who was in that game","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-31T20:21:51.890+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately, I have no method of verifying the exact votes.  In the initial post you said it was 2 yes and 3 no.  Per the[ /remake](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/208754686) guide, in a 4v5 it only requires two players to vote yes.  Two votes for Yes will pass the vote.  Hope that helps clear some things up.","replies":[{"poster":"devilsnevercry66","date":"2016-08-31T23:45:47.789+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"but it wasnt a 4v5 :/","replies":[]},{"poster":"Amarøk","date":"2016-08-31T22:04:01.531+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so basically thats like haha sh*t out of luck why should i lose 20lp not even 3lp for connecting late","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Amarøk","date":"2016-08-31T18:59:32.826+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"i also lost 20lp not 3","replies":[{"poster":"Amarøk","date":"2016-08-31T19:00:35.276+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"other then that instince ive never had a connection issue ive been playing for like 7hours","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"devilsnevercry66","date":"2016-08-31T19:00:16.446+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was in the game, he was in the game and someone started the remake. 1 yes, 3 no's, then one more yes.
