Idc to be flammed, I'm used to it as I've been maining jungle for 3 seasons, but I'm tired of getting report warnings literally every day, what use to result in chat restriction or ranked restriction.\r\n\r\nSome time ago my ranked restriction finished, and 3 days later there it was another ranked + chat restriction.

I can only say that if you are getting so many chat and play restrictions, you must either be toxic as hell or much worse than your rating implies.\n\nLooking at your match stats, you almost never ward. You consistently have the most damage received on your team. Your KDA and damage dealt to champs are all over the place. When playing solo queue, you seem to be about even with just as many and lengthy winning streaks as losing streaks. But your Team Ranked games are almost all wins.\n\nAnalysis: You are being carried hard by your ranked team and should probably not be in your current division. When you are deprived of your team, you play at your actual skill level rather than getting carried. This is why you get flamed in solo queue in your division.","replies":[{"poster":"Coolomat","date":"2015-02-23T21:49:44.226+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is this an actual troll?

I remember a guy streaming that didn't talk in his games and he got some warnings, and eventually a chat restriction. As far I've researched, it seems that now it's automatized. Once you hit some % report rate (or x raw number of reports in y time) you get restricted. \n\nI say this because I got my second restriction just after playing a ranked game with a duo-bot which I didn't gank because they were losing 0-4 and their ADC had BF at min 6, they reported me at the end of the game and then I wasn't able to play ranked anymore. I asked Riot Support about this and they answered me something like \"we are not removing your restrict blah blah blah\".

Their support team always gives automated responses. You ask anything about your ban/restriction/etc and their response is they won't remove it even if you didn't include anything even hinting at it being removed.\n\nI once said in a message \"I am not asking you to remove it at all, I just want to know what caused it\" and got the same message AGAIN even though it had been sent to me once before in the same conversation.
