Not to mention his AP ratio's aren't great (they almost got worse; his Q ratio is up but his W and E ratios are down. Of course his mana ratios are also down, but he still felt like he did a ton of damage with a mana build in the PBE custom I played). There are a ton of useful utility masteries that synergize really well with Ryze (like the increased maximum mana, HP regen based on maximum mana, biscuits, extra gold for that third pot to sustain early, etc), the CDR is only one of the reasons to take it.\n\nTear items don't stack with each other, so it's a huge waste. Righteous glory is not a waste at all; gives him tankiness, mana, *and* more mobility/CC/Sticking power (between ghost, ult, and RG, you pretty much always have a MS steroid available). It's like a perfect item for Ryze.\n\nRyze is a champion that really needs to hit 40% CDR. Having Frozen Heart as a third core item basically restricted his build path more, imo (I really like RG on Ryze, lol). I think they're also doing this to deincentivize tankier builds of Ryze, make him a slightly squishier battle mage (ie. Vladmir; he gets health from his passive, but generally doesn't build resistances), and less of a ranged fighter/bruiser. This is probably another reason they gave him long range with Q.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LilxPaprika","date":"2015-04-10T01:16:15.064+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=junglerboy16,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=laaipAmr,comment-id=000600000000,timestamp=2015-04-10T01:04:45.142+0000)\n> \n> The issue for me is, why take 10% CDR from masteries now when it means that the best mana items that doesn't have a redundant passive and doesn't take extra time to stack becomes equally wasteful to getting a second RoA, a Righteous glory, or another tear item?

You wouldn't see this before because Ryze would never get much of a chance to use it because his long combat window meant that he would never apply the Lich Bane'd up auto, but now that he has distinct moments where he doesn't cast spells that fast Lich Bane might see some use for stronger time periods when his passive isn't up.
