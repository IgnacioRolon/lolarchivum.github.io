Your team lost mid, bot and were out jungled, having a meta support wasn't going to change anything.","replies":[{"poster":"Kanzler","date":"2018-02-23T01:32:32.054+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":7,"body":"Yeah, built a support item but literally cant contribute anything until level 6 (even then it's a low damage assassin). So now it's 2v1 bot and the entire lane is pretty much lost barring constant jungle pressure. Every lane may have lost, but his picking akali did not make it possible to win bot, especially since I hadn't picked a self reliant adc.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Umbral Regent","date":"2018-02-23T01:19:51.092+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, Akali could probably benefit from _Spellthief's Edge_ as a long-term option for gold gain as it involves gaining gold through attacking people, although _Relic Shield_ could also work due to her being melee and being able to easily proc its effects (primarily for short-term lane sustain).\n\nAs for what she contributes; **Kill pressure. _Lots_ of kill pressure.** Especially when she hits level 6, she can be an extremely dangerous thing to have, especially if the bottom laner has even a modicum of CC - light or hard.\n\nShe is like Draven and Caitlyn - a constant threat that is unduly hard to put down, especially when she gets ahead. And while she lacks CC of her own, she sure as shit ain't the first of her kind. Veigar, Brand, Zyra, Zoe - all of them are kill pressure-focused Supports.\n\nIt doesn't take a rocket scientist to know what Akali contributes to a team - which, by the way, the amount of kills she'd be getting would undoubtedly cover the gold income issue presented by playing Support.","replies":[{"poster":"Kanzler","date":"2018-02-23T01:29:32.193+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"That's my point though. An akali without gold/items doesn't have kill pressure. She will pretty much do the same damage as a braum or leona without any of the other benefits involved. Plus when the other team doesn't troll pick, their support will contribute something like CC which shuts her down pretty easily.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"BladeSteel","date":"2018-02-23T02:16:13.182+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:48}}  Would like to have a word with you...","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Coopa123","date":"2018-02-23T00:03:12.385+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd rather have a non meta support in my game than a raging 12 year old.","replies":[{"poster":"MobileSuitGaren","date":"2018-03-26T00:08:07.512+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Coopa123,realm=EUW,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=e49ANMqa,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2018-02-23T00:03:12.385+0000)\n>\n> I&#x27;d rather have a non meta support in my game than a raging 12 year old.\n\nGood one.
