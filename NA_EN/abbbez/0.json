Botlane is the only place they really succeed.\n\n\"But they can go top and completely destroy top laners.\" Until people realize most marksmen are free kills for an aggressive jungler to gank. Then they're unable to farm. So, there is that. :3 \"Diversity\" in a lane at the cost of an entire class is not healthy for the game as a whole. (already traditional supports are being pushed out because of mages that are either too weak for mid-lane currently, or are too good all around)","replies":[{"poster":"reaperteaser","date":"2017-01-29T00:49:26.900+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"adcs going mid has always been a thing, jhin/cait can farm safely and ez, vayne, luc and tris can be pretty hard to gank if they know how to ward correctly","replies":[{"poster":"abbbez","date":"2017-01-29T01:43:07.733+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=reaperteaser,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=GFN3dpEv,comment-id=00000001,timestamp=2017-01-29T00:49:26.900+0000)\n>\n> adcs going mid has always been a thing, jhin/cait can farm safely and ez, vayne, luc and tris can be pretty hard to gank if they know how to ward correctly\n\nTalking about bot lane and not mid lane.","replies":[{"poster":"reaperteaser","date":"2017-01-29T02:55:22.559+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"was not replying to original post","replies":[{"poster":"abbbez","date":"2017-01-29T03:14:18.933+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=reaperteaser,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=GFN3dpEv,comment-id=0000000100000000,timestamp=2017-01-29T02:55:22.559+0000)\n>\n> was not replying to original post\n\nkinda hard to tell when you're not quoting the comment, and well your comment didn't really fit any other so I just kinda had to assume you misunderstood.","replies":[{"poster":"reaperteaser","date":"2017-01-29T04:49:10.007+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"just switch to discussion view","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"winteriscoming97","date":"2017-01-29T00:25:44.595+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think it is moreso that the marksman class is inheritly flawed.
