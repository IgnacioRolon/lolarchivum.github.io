League is most likely to be the main game we play, so I've come back to practice and make sure I'm not as bad as I used to be(Hint, I'm still shit).\r\n\r\nIssue is, though, every time I open League, it goes through the client update again. Wouldn't mind it too much, but it takes 30 minutes to update the whole thing every time I try to play. That's about the length of a regular game, and I'd rather not waste the time like that.\r\n\r\nIs there some way I can fix this, then?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-06-14T18:28:04.047+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"An esports club at your school sounds amazing!  I hope you all are having a great time!  If League is updating every time you launch it, then a security setting or the location of where the game is installed might be forcing the files to remain temporarily.  Firstly, make sure League is installed in your primary internal drive, not a usb or anything like that.\n\nThen you'll want to go through the [permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) guide to make sure that League is added as an exception and there to stay.  I hope that all helps, and have fun out there!","replies":[{"poster":"Misplaced Faith","date":"2017-06-15T16:57:09.414+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Our practices start the 24th of this month.
