Ive tried Hextech repair, changing regions, restarting my computer, etc. I was playing fine yesterday so I'm very confused as to why this is happening and haven't found any solutions on the boards. Please help.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-08-22T18:07:58.811+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Our tech team has received a few reports about this error, and we believe there are a few bad ISP nodes causing this while routing.  Until it's fixed up, see if using a [VPN ](https://haste.net/)can assist in logging you in.  Let me know if that helps.","replies":[{"poster":"Newbcakez","date":"2017-08-22T21:22:59.596+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is correct, if you run either a trace route or use the WinMTR tool and look up 104.160.131.1 and you are routed through a level 3 node in Denver, that area is still down and will prevent you from logging into the game client. Currently the only work around is using a VPN. A VPN that you have to pay for mind you. \n\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yugamineena","date":"2017-08-22T18:35:17.647+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That program doesn't allow me to log in at all. Thought I'd try it out due to others not allowing me on voice programs and stuff. RIP. Is there any timeframe you could give us on when the servers will be fixed?","replies":[]}]}]}
