You will want the extra damage and crit chance from Infinity edge or essence reaver. Especailly with his 4th shot. A lot of Jhin's kill pressure comes from his snare, so you will want the cdr. Every time I rush youmumus I don't feel its worth it.\nIf you are really ahead and you want to buy the cheaper yomumus and then annother item right away you could probably get away with it tho. \nYou could also benefit from the movement speed active, but I wouldn't recommend relying on it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Escheton","date":"2017-01-31T22:30:59.220+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, when you get 4 man ganked you want the active to either run away or kite.","replies":[]},{"poster":"reaperteaser","date":"2017-01-31T22:24:36.894+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i prefer getting bf sword then rfc then whatever armor pen before finishing reaver/blood thirster.  the rfc is just way too mich of a powerspike not to rush","replies":[]}]}
