Particles would look great.\n-Gatekeeper Illaoi\n   -Spectral hands similar to those in the new Galio's Q animation coming up from the ground\n   -Meshes with her theme arguably better than Elderwood, as the hands are dragging you to the underworld.\n-Warden Illaoi\n   -Not sure how to describe the tentacles on this one, look at the picture for a good idea\n   -The concept that she is protecting something and fighting for good could be a cool spin on her current lore, and the particle effects look great.\n-Marauder Illaoi\n   -Axes on chains instead of tentacles\n   -Personally I think this would be the least likely but it still looks dope.\n\nOverall, the Elderwood and Gatekeeper ones are highlights for me, and I would love to see them come to fruition.","replies":[{"poster":"lCantPauseltMom","date":"2017-03-22T05:40:42.301+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Holy those skin concepts look epic!!!!

Q would be a giant pool noodle crashing down on someone - same with her tentacles. W would be the usual squeak. E would rip someone from their body, causing the blue watery figure to stand before Illaoi. A shark would start circling the spirit while playing the jaws theme. If the target leaves beyond range, the shark bursts from the ground and eats the spirit. R would make Illaoi divebomb into a pool of water before emerging with a massive amount of pool noodles to whack enemies with!\n\n**EDIT:** When the pool noodles are no longer active, they attempt to camouflage by turning into coconut trees perhaps? Idol could be a giant coconut? She might be dressed up in a Hawaiian-theme get up, similar to others of the same theme like Lee Sin and Leona.","replies":[{"poster":"Eternal Torment","date":"2017-03-21T08:52:55.287+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is simply genius but most likely will end up as a 1350 rp or even as a 1850 rp skin from all the necessary texture changes added to the additional features","replies":[{"poster":"lCantPauseltMom","date":"2017-03-21T09:51:58.845+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah that's true, sorry I might have missed it but was the price range supposed to be kept as low as possible when coming up with ideas?
