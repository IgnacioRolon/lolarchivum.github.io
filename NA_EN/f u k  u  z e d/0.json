The drop chance does reset about 1 month after you earn your first key fragment at the original drop rate.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-07-11T15:30:32.353+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Zombiemaster provided some good info here and is absolutely correct. To quote the [Hextech Crafting guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207884233-Hextech-Crafting-Guide) verbatim:\n\n> The drop rate for key fragments is a curve, not a line. With each fragment you earn, the chance to earn your next one goes down slightly. This number resets roughly every thirty days after you earn your first key fragment.\n\nI highly recommend reading through that Guide to get the most out of the Hextech Crafting system.","replies":[{"poster":"Cosnirak","date":"2016-07-11T18:00:07.925+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As someone who has always known how it works I personally just don't like that it's not only possible, but for many players in fact the regular monthly occurrence, to go ~3 weeks without a single key fragment dropping. You get 90% of your key fragments in the first 2 days after the reset, the last 10% over the next 2-4 days after that, and then nothing for the rest of the month, and that FEELS awful.\n\nAlso you can track when your monthly key reset is, as well as track your key fragments dropped that month and know when no more can drop for you. But you have to do all that completely on your own... Meanwhile potential boxes are clearly displayed in the client including when the next one will be available. I think we should be able to see our important key fragment info in client as well.\n\nAny chance you can pass this feedback along to the appropriate people Targons Blade? I know I'm not alone is disliking the current way key fragments drop and the lack of transparency and I'd love to hear Riot speak about it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Inting Pillow","date":"2016-07-11T16:49:08.034+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just gonna ask, is there a chance that you will be completely unable to get fragments till reset?","replies":[]}]}]}]}
