{"poster":"Phoneixflare","date":"2016-12-02T09:17:59.195+0000","title":"Let's Talk About Master Yi","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":22,"down_votes":10,"body":"Alright. So let&#039;s talk about Master Yi for just a second.\r\nI&#039;m not sure why Riot decided to hit him with the nerf stick, but Master Yi is weak at virtually all stages of the game currently. He needs to have some form of flow of power whether it be late game with his dueling power, or early game clear speed. There&#039;s a few things wrong with his kit, some of which results of nerfs to him\r\n1) His Q needs to deal more damage on critical strikes. It should maybe deal part of the bonus damage to minions/monsters if it crits in addition to the 60% ad increase. Otherwise, it doesn&#039;t really feel like a &#039;critical&#039; strike when after armor reductions in damage calculations, you are looking at maybe...300-400 damage? depending on how much ad you have(which usually isn&#039;t that much)\r\n2) His base values are actually pretty low for what he is designed to do(to me, which is be able to turn a small advantage in a fight of a low opponent into a chain of resets/continued ultimate because he is a MELEE AD CARRY). He does not have the base health, ad, or attack speed to really fit into this role. As a melee AD Carry, he should have something in the form of a tool/aspect of his kit, or extra utility thrown in so he is on par with someone like Fiora(her passive giving bonus damage, her ultimate healing if played properly), Tryndamere(unkillable in ultimate, passive crit chance generation and healing, ad reduction of nearby enemies and a decent slow with a great ranged gapcloser) or a hybrid melee carry such as Jax(aoe stun that dodges auto attacks, auto attack reset that deals bonus magic damage, scaling attack speed buff the longer the fight goes on)...but what does Yi have? How can he excel when he is clearly outclassed by everyone else in a similar category as him. If he has hardly any utility or crowd control, he should deal more damage or have more attack speed and movespeed somewhere. Because as it stands...why play Yi when you could play so many other champions in the same way to the same effect or better and actually have a solid team composition? It honestly just feels like Yi is so underpowered that he has no place on any team, even one with lots of crowd control and engage because everyone else still ends up outdamaging him.\r\n3) His e(and most of his kit in general) doesn&#039;t scale into late game very well with the passive 10% ad bonus. It should start smaller than 10% and grow to something like...say...18 or 20% passive bonus ad. this way he&#039;ll actually have the ability to fight and win against people who he should normally win against. And honestly, it needs an auto attack reset functionality to it. That extra hit is almost always the difference between a kill or not, or having q off cooldown or not. Late game you should HAVE to flash away from a master yi who ultis and q&#039;s you or risk dying in a few autos. \r\n4) His build paths are incredibly limited. Virtually, there are only two build paths currently: on hit bloodrazor(-&gt;bork) and then full tank after that(deadmans titanic/mallet/visage GA), and the bloodrazor crit build(which I personally prefer because it has applications with his q being able to crit which means extra burst potentially as opposed to 0 from the onhit build.) However, since there is not a good way to reach 100% crit rate as a melee without sacrificing some damage items, your damage is unreliable from the crit build, and the onhit build forces you to auto attack as much as possible meaning you have to stay in the melee range of the fight longer and hope your onhit does the killing for you instead of getting lucky crits. This is partly because of the removal of things like feral flare and devourer when yi was at his prime because he could build less damage and still deal a fair amount while succeeding at what he is good at: clearing the jungle very quickly. Especially now in the farm oriented jungle, it doesn&#039;t make sense that Yi who has decently fast clear speeds doesn&#039;t really get to benefit at all. He is either a glass cannon or a meh tanky dps guy who still needs to use his ulti to close the distance between his opponent and him. I mean, Shyvana gets buffs to allow her to have sticking power. Olaf gets buffs(a looooooooong time ago albeit) to allow him to have sticking power. How come Yi gets left out of the party? Slow immunity? Olaf gets all cc immunity. Just play olaf. He&#039;s better and has a better kit overall.\r\n5) His ultimate time is FAR too short. 7 seconds doesn&#039;t allow him to get in position and then keep it in the fight like it is supposed to. Often times you&#039;ll use highlander to try to catch a speedy opponent, who you should be able to outrun with the movespeed bonus(which also needs to be increased) only to have your buff expire before you can land 2-3 auto attacks. It&#039;s honestly not fair when you feel like you don&#039;t ever have an ultimate unless you are already in the fight and get to pop it. It should be about 10 seconds long(which I believe it used to be). Otherwise, if you were to keep the short duration...it needs to do more or be extended by a lot more on a reset because it doesn&#039;t actually allow him to chain the way he should be able to unless everyone is all grouped up. Yi should 100% be able to clean up a fight of low hp enemies and only through incredible outplay on the enemy side should they come out victorious. I mean, Yi should be this one man army. His ultimate is called Highlander...aka there can be only one. \r\n6) His passive. If it&#039;s called double strike...why does it only do 1.5x damage? I get it, early game an extra FULL auto attack is a lot of dps, but late game it should deal at least 2.0x damage(and be able to crit) OR give it some sort of scaling where it starts off at 1.25x, then 1.5, then 2.0 OR give it crit scaling where the crit on the double strike enables it to deal full damage and crit instead of 50%. I preferred the old double strike with 7 autos getting to actually hit two times and proc on hit effects.\r\n7)His W doesn&#039;t offer much to his kit aside from the damage reduction which is canceled by crowd control. The heal is minimal, and that&#039;s being generous. The heal is ONLY ever good when you are lower on health but when you direly need to heal it doesn&#039;t ever seem to be enough. I think the healing increase at lower health values should be increased so that he can play around certain enemy champion&#039;s cooldowns and effectively duel them/outplay them instead of hoping the damage reduction will be enough to survive one auto or spell before you can hopefully either flash away or flash q and kill them somehow.\r\n\r\nWith the fervor changes, I thought Yi would have the potential to really be good this season. But he seems the most underpowered he has ever been in my opinion. Which is really sad because...he was the first champion I fell in love with back when ap yi was still a thing(i started out playing him ad of course though) and was the first champion i wanted to buy a skin for. Thunderlords doesn&#039;t seem to fit him because he isn&#039;t exactly and assassin like say, shaco or talon. Warlords..eh...the lifesteal might help sometimes but overall the fact that it&#039;s inconsistent sort of makes it hit or miss and only helpful in dire situations(which is basically what warlords is used for anyways, but doesn&#039;t fit the archetype that is yi to me)\r\n\r\nHonestly, playing Yi is just sad at this point. It feels sluggish. Ganks(as a jungler) are extremely difficult to be succesful even at level 6(which should be a major power spike for yi) because his ultimate level 1 is honestly garbage. Not even close to enough movespeed, not nearly enough attack speed for it to be profitable to actually try and fight someone who will most likely out damage you with their abilities and/or find a way to survive through utility.\r\n I think what you SHOULD do with Yi to make his ulti really fun(since he has to be in melee range anyways) is do what you did to old rework Kogmaw, where it doubles his attack speed value and allows him to exceed the limit of 2.5. It would make Master Yi the champion of on hit builds, and even crit would be incredibly strong on him!  \r\nOf course, obviously you&#039;d need to reduce the power of his e so he wouldn&#039;t absolutely demolish anyone who stays in melee range of him(although that IS what should happen when you don&#039;t effectively kite or cc an yi, he should be like a chainsaw to people who stay in melee range of him. shredded.), and probably tune down his q damage if you were to do that. I understand that his ultimate makes him a lot less susceptible to being kited because of the slow immunity, but given that so many higher tier champions have gap closers or cc of some kind(even assassins) Master Yi is hardpressed to find winning fights in many stages of the game. If he gets cc&#039;d, he&#039;s useless. If he sits at the edge of the fight, he&#039;s useless dealing no damage. It&#039;s sort of a lose lose situation. However, a champion very similar named Irelia gets tenacity based on the number of opponents around, a built in flat value on hit heal that doubles on activation(but without a scaling true damage on hit like yi), and a REALLY long stun and gap closer that applies on hit effects, such as lifesteal or hiten style. Irelia is able to dash in to start a fight, stay alive long enough in the fight to remain a damage threat or threat in general that needs to be peeled, but Yi runs into the problem of being instantly popped the second he gets crowd controlled. \r\n\r\nANYWAYS, TL;DR, \r\nMaster Yi needs some changes because he is in a very bad spot right now. He&#039;s very out of meta and needs some tweaks in order to remain relevant in the span of a game.\r\nhis ultimate needs buffs/changes. His e needs buffs. overall he isn&#039;t doing as much damage as any of the other melee adc&#039;s are capable of doing who ALSO have more utility than he does.\r\nriot pls","replies":[{"poster":"CppL","date":"2016-12-02T09:59:54.161+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":5,"body":"They buffed botrk and rageblade ,thats prety nice buff for yi.","replies":[{"poster":"Sex on Rìft","date":"2016-12-02T15:39:56.498+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rageblade kills Yi himself, that item is ABSOLUTELY UNRELIABLE.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GULAG 4 U","date":"2016-12-02T22:00:41.977+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rageblade fucking sucks on Yi.

Idk, I just don't think Yi can realistically be played in a competitive way because he just doesn't cut it the way other champions do.","replies":[{"poster":"ForgivenSoul","date":"2016-12-02T10:23:56.691+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"you could check out Cowsep. you might be able to get some ideas from him for builds and such. hes a Diamond 1 Yi main on the Korean server.

Duration 7s sucks, +7s / kill or assist is irrelevant, 4 was fine. But 10 s initial duration is a must have for the viability of his ganks. The CD as well is too long (was increased on a nerf). Yi can't fight at all without ult. That's it, he doesn't need any more changes than reverts on that. Sure, he'd_ like_ other buffs but I'm pretty sure that would end up in him being overnerfed afterwhile, so just this is fine.","replies":[{"poster":"Phoneixflare","date":"2016-12-07T22:33:19.910+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think the biggest culprits are his ultimate and e damage because thats his primary source of damage.
