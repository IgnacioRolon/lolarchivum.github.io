Is anybody else experiencing MASSIVE ping spikes in game where they have never had lag issues previously before the new update? I'm wondering if its just me. When i run a speedtest without league running I get 9 ms ping but with it running it's sometimes over 100 and sometimes 40 and sometimes 20 depending on what happens in game. But I have never had an issue with myself lagging or experience raw frame drops or anything. Can someone help?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-11-17T16:57:52.054+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't want you to log anymore either, that has to be frustrating!  These sudden spikes suggest packet loss, but run a [log reader](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743-Connection-Troubleshooting-Log-Reader) on these games so we can really know for sure.  The results should also offer some troubleshooting steps specific to you, but let me know what you find.","replies":[{"poster":"Phoneixflare","date":"2017-11-21T15:08:28.021+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"okay so...today I straight up cannot log in at all. so...now I dont know what to do.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Phoneixflare","date":"2017-11-21T13:15:41.689+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thank you so much!
