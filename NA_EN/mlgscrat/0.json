I can use the shop, open chests, and join champ select just fine, but as soon as my game launches, it shows a black screen. This had happened in a ranked game, and when trying to fix it, I found that holding alt tab would let me see the screen, but I would still like to fix it. Any help would be appreciated, thanks :)","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-20T00:13:31.584+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If hitting alt+tab makes the game window viewable again, something might be forcing its window to the front of the screen which would explain why you couldn't see the game. You could try resetting your config files to make sure League knows it's supposed to stay in the front, but let me know if this doesn't help!\n\n- Log into the game client\n- Navigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\n- Delete the file  named **game.cfg** and **persistedsettings.json**\n- Go into a practice game and verify that settings have saved properly. \n- Leave game to sync settings","replies":[]}]}
