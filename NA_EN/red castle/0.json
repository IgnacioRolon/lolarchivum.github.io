When killing Kled, Yorick says **\"One more nail in the coffin of the isles.\"** This voice-line is supposed to be reserved for Shadow Isles Champions ONLY. I'm 100% sure Kled is NOT from the Shadow Isles. This bug is tiny and it doesn't matter that much overall, but its a major annoyance for Yorick players. A fix would be lovely Riot.","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2017-08-25T03:19:20.113+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"hmmm...this definitely sounds like it might be a bug.  To be honest though, on the grand scale of things, this is going to rank pretty low.  So it might not get fixed any time soon >.<  \n\nStill, I really appreciate you taking the time to create a Boards post about it!  Definitely worth bringing it to our attention!","replies":[{"poster":"Red Castle","date":"2017-08-25T07:26:44.701+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No problem!
