I saw on Deviantart or other websites tributes to their work shown in art. Also I noticed that people very often play with art by picturing their favorite characters as different genders. It looks super funny so I wonder what Riot would think about this idea. What about making gender bender skins for some characters? Also what do you - players - think about it? Would you like skins like that? Which characters would you like to see as different genders?\n\nI think that people could like gender bender skins because it would be funny, ridiculous or on the other hand interesting and different. Can you image female Garen? The big, muscular lady with square jaw and short girly skirt? Or super hot and sexy male Ahri? Or old granny Zilean rushing with her walking frame and putting on heads of enemies explosive applepies, mugs of hot chocolate or what grannies usually like to make? I bet Wawrick would love to eat her.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\n\nhttps://i.pinimg.com/originals/37/f1/89/37f189c1340e503d64e152fd60c24f98.jpg\n(The picture of lady Twisted Face is from https://monorirogue.deviantart.com )","replies":[{"poster":"kattzkitti","date":"2017-11-12T15:02:48.939+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":1,"body":"Every gender bender skin would require new voice work, so would at minimum be priced at Legendary tier (1,820 RP).

I wonder why political agenda would like some gender bender skins in the game. I mean it's obvious that people don't need to associate themselves with characters in LoL by gender, they like characters in the game NOT because of gender but because they are funny or cool or super dark and evil or cute or anything they like and gender bender character main strenght is just being funny or interesting. I think that being prisoner of agenda is not only letting it dictate what you have to think but also not allowing yourself thinking freely about things even in some distant way connected to agenda. Not allowing yourself being creative because it has something similar to somebody's agenda.\n\nYou know, I just had an idea and I shared it. It would be great to think about it without any background, but I can understand that people in US or other countries are hypersensitive about gender stuff. I already started to lose hope this idea can succeed.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Pandemic Punch","date":"2017-11-13T01:59:51.196+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"GROSS","replies":[]},{"poster":"BoNaFiDeOuTkAsT","date":"2017-11-12T17:41:39.844+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"+1 I love it!\n{{sticker:garen-swing}} \n\nWas kinda hoping this was about cross dressing.
