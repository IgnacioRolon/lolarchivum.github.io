Merc Treads tenacity is lowered to 20%. This will be highly beneficial to CC-based mages, tanks and supports. And also make champions with kit-intrinsic tenacity more valuable. Hello {{champion:36}} {{champion:39}} .\r\n\r\n**Initial spawn timers reduced.**\r\n\r\nGames now have 15 seconds less downtime in the beginning. Potentially, less early action?\r\n\r\n**Major Tower Buff**\r\n\r\nTowers now work more like minions, with no resistances, but increased health pools. The new health values are higher than the raw conversion of the previous eHP into HP with the removal of resistances. E.g. outer towers had 100 res and 1000 HP, now have 3500 HP.\r\n\r\n**AP ratio for tower damage increased to 0.5**\r\n\r\nAP champions are now slightly better in tower taking potential. With Nashor&#039;s, an AP will be able to take a tower almost as fast as an AD.\r\n\r\n**Teleport is nerfed**\r\n\r\nNo longer has reduced cooldown on teleporting to towers. \r\n\r\n**Jungle changes**\r\n\r\nJungle monsters have less XP. Jungle items give bonus XP. Laners will no longer be able to take camps for fast level 2.\r\n\r\n**Elixir of Iron buffed**\r\n\r\nNow gives 300 HP, too - and Tenacity, which has increased in value.\r\n\r\n**Powerspikes**\r\n\r\nEspecially the gold flow changes, but also the item improvements, will affect the timings and impacts of champion powerspikes. This is the most intangible change, and its effects will not completely revealed unless everyone got used to the changes.","replies":[{"poster":"pripustas","date":"2015-11-01T12:21:43.703+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":18,"body":"Also with games made more fast paced early game champions will fall out of meta completely.

No one teleports to towers in the first place! They couldn't care about their outer turrets falling because it wouldn't have protected them from dives anyway, and sidelane pressure doesn't matter anymore since tower dives are so easy to pull off with your team in other lanes.

I feel like he has too many options for offensive items without having to worry heavily on HP + Resists items due to his Passive and his Mega Form. \n\nAnyway. Gnar's boomerang into AA's plus Frozen Mallet is one of the most painful things to deal with as his W procs chunk and he will be able to stay on you no matter what you do unless you have a teammate or tower nearby to dissuade him from pursuing.","replies":[{"poster":"Marquis","date":"2015-11-04T01:11:13.652+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is so much false info in here, I'm just gonna put it in list format:\n-the only item in there that is viable on Gnar is black cleaver\n-he isn't even close to a great user of Sterak's\n-all dedicated tanks need at least 5 tank items (Gnar is a \"dedicated tank\")\n-black cleaver was changed, not nerfed (it lost 10 ad, 10 armor pen, gained 200 hp, and  gained rage passive)\n-you shouldn't be giving people \"advice\" if you have never played a ranked game","replies":[{"poster":"Hard4Hamsters","date":"2015-11-07T02:53:37.986+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I will say that you have the false info here. I will start by stating that every item that I mentioned as an offensive/semi-offensive option has a situational use on Gnar and that every one of the mentioned items has been used by professional players in competition as stand alone items or in conjunction with more offensive options. Check the games of Zion Spartan, Impact, and Smeb to see what I'm talking about. \n\nSituational buys on offensive items early help you hold your own in lane and give you a damage boost in midgame teamfights even if you are going to be a main tank of the team. Hexdrinker is one of the best items into a magic damage opponent like Rumble to be able to effectively trade with him. The passive of Hexdrinker will also give a significant shield in the midgame to help you survive that extra few seconds to dish out a little extra damage or get away without giving a kill over to your enemies. \n\nAnother thing to consider is that if you have another main tank on your team (say a Jungler) and your other laners are behind or your comp is lacking in damage overall. Getting an offensive item or two can make you more of a threat to the enemy team and with the items of {{item:3022}} {{item:3155}} {{item:3053}} {{item:3071}}, you aren't taking a massive hit to your overall tankiness, meaning you will still be a pretty good frontliner.\n\nOn Sterak's specifically, he is actually a fairly good user of the item right now and I think the item is only good on a handful of champs situationally, but Gnar can use it very well due to having a lot of Total AD scaling on his abilities, his AA's being a very important part of his damage output, and his Mega Form having the highest Base AD of any champion in the game (pretty sure) meaning he gets the most AD out of the item. His passive charges based on how much he outputs damage and how much he takes as well making Sterak's perfect for him. Gaining size and a shield (particularly in Mega Form) will also be very beneficial for his Crowd Control and tanking ability in Mega form. \n\nOn Black Cleaver, I was mentioning the preseason changes that are currently on the PBE for the item. The cost was increased to 3500 and the AD went up to 55 while the HP it gives has gone down to 300, so I felt like it was an overall nerf, at least to Gnar with the item as the cost increase hurts him and he didn't care about the AD as much as the CDR, HP, Rage passive and armor shred. \n\nLastly, I wasn't giving people advice like you stated. I was making an observation and stating my opinion on the matter. If people read it and thought on it, maybe they would come to the same conclusion or maybe they would land somewhere else. But I will leave with this. Whether or not someone plays ranked does not really indicate whether or not they have some basic knowledge of the game and can make assumptions based on experience and numbers of items, champions, and abilities about interactions within that game. Rank can be a very good indication on how much you know about the game as you have to know a really good volume of it to achieve higher ranks, but it is not a requirement of someone who has good game knowledge to have a high rank or to even play ranked at all. I personally have played over 2000 games of League. Maybe one day I would decide to try my hand at Ranked but I don't see the point other than to prove to a bunch of people on the boards that I have some idea of what I'm talking about. \n\nAnyway.
