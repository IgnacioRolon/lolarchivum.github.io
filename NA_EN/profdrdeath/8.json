I'm no artist, but I think the splash would do better with a bit of a warmer palette (not warm, but warmer; I'd like some of the \"charm\" feel), larger/darker pupils (they look a bit too distant), and a hint of a smile (for the \"charm\" feel). Perhaps have her hair a bit neater, while still having that \"wild\" look (more on the side of curly than uneven lengths?). Maybe I'm off with the suggestions, I don't know...to me she looks like a scared fox running away, instead of a cunning fox luring you in closer... (I think Dynasty Ahri does a better job with Ahri's character)\n\n{{champion:53}} : Such Hit, wow. Out of habit I found myself juking to the side irl to try to dodge the hook :P\n\n{{champion:81}} : I'm a fan, Hit. Ezreal looks more like that cocky, punky kid he's supposed to be\n\n{{champion:40}} : Miss; like you said, she looks too distant, also very elfish and too skinny, doesn't look like her lore depicts her as (which sounds like a retconn is coming....I hope they don't change too much...). Janna is supposed to be a human that becomes more otherworldly; her new splash makes her seem a bit too otherworldly, too inhuman (Frost Queen and Victorious Janna hit a better mark imo)\n\n{{champion:10}} : ~~Hit, my lord she looks awesome.~~ Unsure, [Legacy of Xion](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/story-art/l1LzKs52-new-splashes?comment=00090000) brings up some good points; I still like the splash, but wouldn't be opposed to some of the changes Legacy of Xion brings up. I agree with [Ashes Arise](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/story-art/l1LzKs52-new-splashes?comment=0003), her thumbnail could use some touch ups (Lee Sin round 2/Shiny Diglett), but overall I like it.\n\n{{champion:62}} : Miss, it looks like he's trying to be aggressive and playful at the same time, basically face pulling in opposite directions. Like [Ashes Arise](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/story-art/l1LzKs52-new-splashes?comment=0003) was saying, the cheeky expression is pretty canon. (See his old splash and Jade Dragon Wukong)\n\n{{champion:98}} : Hit. Shen looks so awesome. I agree he looks a bit sinister, but he *is* a ninja; it'd be cool if they found a way to make that protector element a bit more apparent (for people who don't know what his ult does), but I like the new art.\n\n{{champion:91}} : Hit. He actually looks like an assassin now. Poor helmet bro\n\n{{champion:18}} : ~~Hit, almost perfect,~~ Not sure, actually, she looks a bit stylistically different than Rocket Jump Tristana, which is my personal favorite, but I do like the new look. I sort of wish her clothes looked a little less like she found them on the ground. Not sure what to suggest, I like the armor, but the clothes seem sort of plain in comparison.\n\n{{champion:45}} : ~~Hit,~~ definite improvement, but not quite sure either, there's something sort of playful or comical about Veigar that doesn't fully come across. I do like the new look, though.\n\n{{champion:26}} : Hit, he looks awesome\n\nBasically, there's something playful about Ahri, Janna, and Wukong that I think the splashes don't capture; the art is great but it doesn't feel like the characters. There are certain characters that are very serious (Kayle, Shen, Talon), and the splashes do a good job with that, and there are characters that are more playful (Ezreal, Tristana) and their splashes do a good job with that too. I'd say Ahri's is the worse offender; I only really have a problem with Wukong/Janna's faces, they're almost there; the rest of the splash seems pretty good. Ahri's looks like it's a harrowing skin, which it really shouldn't, the layout and general look of the splash is good, just certain details and colors would make it much better imo\n\nThe ones I'm split about I generally like, but I don't know if they're as spot-on as the ones I listed as \"Hits\"","replies":[{"poster":"Legacy of Xion","date":"2014-10-13T20:59:21.004+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> My opinion (Hit or Miss):\n> \n> {{champion:103}} : Miss, she looks sort of ghostly, doesn't really capture the vixen nature about her.\n> \n> {{champion:53}} : Such Hit, wow.\n> \n> {{champion:81}} : I'm a fan, Hit.

She does enact Justice. But we also know that she does so with finesse.  She listens and investigates. Justice is ugly, but she doesn't drop a hammer on the guilty - she ensures justice must be served.\n\nThis splash just gives me either \"evil angel\" which Viridian did fine or \"cold justice angel\" which she isn't. I see the light effect but the melted gold outer shell just does not fit at all. It makes no sense, looks bad...GAH. It makes her look less androgynous as a whole.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"insaiyanbacca","date":"2014-10-13T22:09:32.812+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"the only ones that really stood out to me were {{champion:98}}  {{champion:26}}  and {{champion:53}}  other then that while the others look better then the current ones these ones are the best IMO.(i now have to buy {{champion:98}}  just for that awesome splash)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rew711","date":"2014-10-14T02:33:01.134+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think Wu looks fine.

The shield confuses the shapes, so you don't even get a clear idea of what Kayle is.  From that splash art, I'd almost Imagine that Kayle was a woman in armour who travelled around inside a floating sphere with wings, rather than that the wings are attached to her and the sphere is a temporary shield.\n\nI also don't like the new Wukong splash - it looks really cartoony, with large patches of flat colour on him, and the background too blurry.\n\n\nThe new Zilean is awesome, though.

You guys are changing so fast!  O_o\n\nWhile I can clearly see a darker tone in many of the new splash arts, I'm O.K. with it.  I think that Riot has nailed it with this splash art change strategy. The first contact between a player and a Champion is usually the splash art, and these new splashes will make great first impressions. \n\nI'm gonna prepare my tissues, because if Wukong got a change, Leona will also get a new Splash. And I can't wait. Make me proud, guys. :´)","replies":[]}]}
