But I always take 9 points as a Jungler for cooldown on smite and increased buffs.\n\nThere are some idosyncracies though:\n***Phasewalker:*** that one second is barely noticeable, maybe it should add up to three points?\n***Fleet of Food:*** 0,5% is about 2 points, almost no effect, either increase the value or give it in one point.\n***Vampirism:*** The three points mean you can't take it whole without sacrificing Havoc in offense. Otherwise 3% is hard to notice.\n***Culinary Mastery:*** I know it was added as a joke/easter egg, but 10 mana? come on!\n***Greed:*** again, three points for not much, but you need it for Scavenger.\n***Bandit:*** this gives a lot less gold for melees, to the point where you have to question it's worth.\n\nThe other options are great. Especially the gold ones, except for greed, they only cost one point and they add up. Inspiration gives you an entire level throughout the game.\n\nWhat I'd like to see here is:\nsome form of CC on Attack or Spellcast and/or increasing the effect of your CC by a percentage.\nSome addition to heals, shield and buffs (think Ardent Censer) or a percentage increase of those.\nMore vision, like increased trinket duration. Or maybe: all your spells provide vision.\n---\nDefense\n\nThe tree feels just weak on every step. \n\nThe entire first line is about giving one point each.\n***Reinforced Armor*** and ***Juggernaut*** are probably the only good options here, but they are limited to a single point.\n***Veteran Scars***, ***Perseverance*** and ***Legendary Guardian*** are the right stuff, but they take too many points for what they give.\nAnd ***Runic Blessing*** is not even a joke, \"after each death, you block two minion attacks\" ... This needs to scale or use %hp and it needs to recharge on recall.\n\nWhat I'd like to see added is a CC on being hit.\n---\nOffense\n\nThis tree is the most comprehensive I think. It provides solid options for all AD, AP or AS based builds, even Hybrid. It could give a bit more for crit based builds other than ***Frenzy*** though. And some other small stuff:\n\nI think ***Sorcery*** and ***Fury*** take too many points for 5%. \n***Sorcery** should be 2/3,5/5 % and Fury should give 2/4/6/8 %.\n***Butcher*** and ***Feast*** are for minions and monsters, but because monsters are a lot stronger, it's a lot less usefull in the jungle.\nIt's annoying that the scaling AD/AP come before the flat ones, sometimes I only want to spend that one point there, because I wanted AS and Cdr.\n\nWhat I think is missing aside from the crit options, is and option with defense reduction.

With new baron buff, you could have a 3 second recall with that. lol. That's how I like to look at it, but yeah, by itself it's not noticeable much.\n\n> ***Fleet of Food:*** 0,5% is about 2 points, almost no effect, either increase the value or give it in one point.\n\nAlso, I've done some math on this. 3 points in Fleet of Foot is 1.5% which is exactly the same as a movement speed quint. Which is why I use on my Katarina for more mobility. 3 movement speed quints, and that (which is then like having 4 movement speed quints), and if you get Sorcerer Boots early, then that's a lot of movement. Could spend time roaming more early game. If I remember right, 1.5% gives 5 movement speed. So that would be 20, plus 25 from normal boots of speed.\n\nbut yeah, I generally agree on this one. Not much, and I only use it on certain champs.\n\n> ***Culinary Mastery:*** I know it was added as a joke/easter egg, but 10 mana? come on!\n\nDid you know, they don't value the return of mana at all. They have good mana masteries like mana regen and expanded mind, but they don't care about the return of mana. Only the health. Culinary: 20 health, 10 mana. Feast: Was 2 health, 2 mana at first I think. Now it's 3 health, 1 mana. Like really?? Would be nice if it was 3 health, 2 mana. The hate on mana returns.\n\n> ---\n> Defense\n> \n> The tree feels just weak on every step. \n> \n> The entire first line is about giving one point each.\n> ***Reinforced Armor*** and ***Juggernaut*** are probably the only good options here, but they are limited to a single point.\n> ***Veteran Scars***, ***Perseverance*** and ***Legendary Guardian*** are the right stuff, but they take too many points for what they give.\n> And ***Runic Blessing*** is not even a joke, \"after each death, you block two minion attacks\" ...

I like that. Would make choices a bit easier. Seriously. 8% attack speed would also open more options for runes so I also like that one. For champs that use AD marks, AS Quints. You could then go AD marks, 2 AD quint, 1 AS quint and have the other 8% from masteries. So you get more damage at the cost of 1% AS.\n\nActually, it would then be more effective to go 3 AS marks and then the rest AD. 1 point more damage, 0.6% more AS, and only 0.4% AS less than 3 AS Quints. With that 8% from masteries. Giving you 13.1% AS with 12.45 AD instead of the normal 8.55 AD with 13.5% AS.","replies":[{"poster":"Rock Rockburgh","date":"2015-01-09T20:02:50.294+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Note: Phasewalker decreases the channel time of Enhanced Recall by only 0.5 seconds.","replies":[{"poster":"ChimeiTekinaNasu","date":"2015-01-09T21:10:01.323+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"From that comment, I can see you play a lot of Dominion, sir. \"Reduces the casting time of Recall by 1 second.

The way it is worded it sounds like it only protects the user of the mastery. Kind of a weird mastery because all of those conditions except slow greatly limit enemy damage output as is.\n\nInspiration is weak and poorly designed.\n\nStrength of spirit is very weak.\n\nVampirism is in a spot nobody can effectively use. I believe the offense and defense trees out power creeped utility in the last rework. I don't see solo lanes or jungles going into utility. Lifesteal runes/masteries got a lot nerfs. But honestly was it deserved? We can't have lifesteal builds without losing way too much HP from masteries and whatever quint slots offer?\n\nI'm not really a fan of a support role tree to be honest. I have to wonder what if we had a Berserker/Gaurdian/Sorcerer trees instead. It's more cookie cutter... Yeah, it would remove 21 offense carries the possibility of a choice of 9 defense or utility. But supports would diversify. Already existing goodies in utility can go into other trees.\n\n9 defense is too attractive compared to 9 utility. Too much value from bonus hp and damage mitigation. Buy more sustain instead if needed. 9 utility would be cool if extra starting gold or a biscuit could be obtained early in the tree. I don't run 21-6-3 for meditation on anyone anymore. Feast and teleport OP.\n\nIs 21 defense balanced compared to 21 defense? What does Darius choose... Usually offense because he is a snowball type champion. Maybe that isn't a good example... Sure, plenty of champs still prefer defense masteries, usually slower bruisers/tanks. I feel safer when I run them on Gnar although seems most Gnars run offense it looks like. But is it possible offense being better 1v1 skews the top lane meta in favor of mobility and range? I know defense is nice in teamfights because of legendary gaurdian.\n\nYou can nerf 21-9-0 and buff 9-21-0 by moving some of the good stuff in 9 defense deeper into the tree. Probably Unyielding. Or 3% hp. This might make 21 offense with more in utility easier to buff.\n\nI wonder what if a 21-9-0 Darius had a fight with a 9-21-0 Darius.
