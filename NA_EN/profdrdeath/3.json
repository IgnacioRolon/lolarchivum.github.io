[Champion.gg](http://champion.gg/statistics/#?roleSort=Top&sortBy=general.overallPosition&order=ascend) has put her on top of the top lane food chain for quite some patches now.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAs an Irelia player since my inception into LoL, what I'd like to see if she still proves to be on the too-strong side after the next patch:\r\n\r\n- Change Equilibrium Strike to physical damage. Currently, Irelia can level E and get a really strong magical nuke (due to high base damage) and long CC - while building for both burst and sustained physical damage with Phage, Hiten Style and Sheen-empowered auto-attacks. This makes playing and itemizing against her in lane tedious at best - if you build either resistance, she wops you with the other type of damage and the true damage from HS. If you build health, you are protected against all her kinds of damage - but health is not optimal against sustained damage.\r\n- Have the stun duration scale from half to full with the actual difference in absolute %-HP. The remainder of the duration would be the slow. For example, a rank 5 E of an Irelia with 0.01% HP less than you would stun you for 1 second, then slow you for another one.\r\n-    If it nerfs her too hard (or E max proves still to be problematic), add a slight total AD ratio to the damage, while lowering the base to some degree (so she has the same damage at a desired breakpoint).\r\n\r\nChanging E to physical damage gives Irelia's opponents a way to actually deal with her (buy some armor), but might also open up new itemization options for Irelia herself (how about some penetration?). The latter especially if the AD ratio is added.\r\n\r\nNow, with all that said, I'd be sad if Irelia was totally nerfed out of viability. She's still one of my favorites, after all.","replies":[{"poster":"Martyrofsand","date":"2015-03-15T00:36:58.322+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"What ia funny is Irelia being strong right now isn't a product of her as a champ but is instead a product of the top lane meta.  Honestly when top lane was Shyvana/Mundo/Renek/etc Irelia didn't even look at top lane, but when it became Ryze/Gnar/Liss/Morg/etc surprise surprise a champion who can instantly close the gap, stick to them and deal a mix of damage becomes strong.\n\nIf top lane returned to a melee slug fest or tank battle Irelia would vanish almost over night without any nerfs being needed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Renaille","date":"2015-03-14T12:34:36.513+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"I like how \"doesn't get shit on by ranged top laners as hard as most melees\" means someone is too strong.","replies":[{"poster":"ProfDrDeath","date":"2015-03-14T13:20:35.310+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://champion.gg/champion/Irelia/Top\n\nScroll down to the match-ups.\n\nThe first two match-ups with ranged champions in which Irelia seems to have problems are Swain and Heimerdinger, and they are not even in the 10 worst match-ups of her.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"NorthernDruid","date":"2015-03-14T15:07:59.724+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"That Image is so awesome, where is it from? :o\n\nI think one interesting nerf would be to change her Hiten Style to a toggle between health-on-hit and true damage.
