Sums it up pretty dam well as do many of the comments.\nOne common opinion is that keystones and masteries in general add absurd amounts of damage with very little flexibility compared to the previous (no key-stone) mastery system. Keystones saw champs nerfed due to their mere existence and the \"options\" boil down to 2 at most, 1 in a majority of cases. There has and always will be an optimal cookie cutter build and there is no way around that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LankPants","date":"2017-01-18T23:57:31.384+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you plan to nerf CotC more and nerf jungle EXP further then what the fuck is your plan for jungle tanks?

You also say that you plan to nerf CotC and EXP again. CotC is an obvious nerf but so is EXP. Jungle tanks are level reliant, most aren't that gold reliant but they need levels to function. If If they're underleveled they end up being squishy and lacking core ranks in skills that they need to function. That's why most tank only gank opportunistically before level 6 and mostly hard farm there.\n\nYou also didn't answer my question at all, what are you going to do about how weak the class is currently?

When you get Cinderhulk on a tank you're still squishy as fuck unless you're Rammus. The item gives a block 450ish HP on completion but it really doesn't help you be tanky at that. You're still massively lacking in resists, you need 3 items to really be tanky as a tank in the jungle in most cases. Normally that's Cinder/Rands/SV.\n\n>It's the early levels that're the problem, but it's hard to buff tanks and only tanks, there.\n\nSo let them have a weakness and give them a strength in another area. If jungle tanks are weak early game they should scale up hard. Currently they don't. Someone like Lee starts stronger and keeps pace to around 3-4 items. Why would I play a tank when they take so long to scale and barely outscale anyway.\n\nCinderhulk is a good solution to this. It's a solution that only effects jungle tanks and doesn't help out lane tanks who aren't struggling in the same way. A simple buff like 15% increased HP>20% increased would mean an extra 100ish HP at 3 items, that's a very useful buff.\n\nIf I'm wrong and early game still winds up being a problem then my solution would be to tweak the Legendary Guardian mastery at T5 of the resolve tree to be something like 'take reduced damage from non-minion auto attacks and reflect an equal amount as magic damage'. Something like that would help tanks clear while being relatively exclusive to tanks, since it would require at least taking a resolve Keystone. With some tweaks to CotC to make it less attractive to bruisers *cough* %bonus HP *cough* you could expect most offensive junglers not to want to spec all the way down the resolve tree.","replies":[{"poster":"Hyrum Graff","date":"2017-01-19T23:33:37.543+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry, I was unclear.

That way it doesn't have as much benefit in trades and skirmishes, but still shines in late game fights.\n\nSuggestion 2 - Replace Courage of the Colossus with a keystone that reduces damage taken while under the effects of hard CC. Tanks are supposed to body block and absorb CC, so taking less damage while CC'd would fit. Maybe make the reduced damage scale off armor and MR so that skirmishers and assassins couldn't use it to cover their weaknesses.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Varnoc","date":"2017-01-19T21:16:39.221+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just finished something that I wanted to bring to your attention.

I find there is a lot of ways to go about it. (small rant incomming)\n\nRegarding tanks being too squishy against magic damage I personally agree with you, but could this not at least in part be attributed to there just not being that many great magic resist items? According to champion.gg the most frequent build on maokai is {{item:3068}} {{item:3075}} {{item:3065}} {{item:3026}} {{item:3111}} {{item:3025}}  a build which gives far more armor than magic resist.\n\nEven if I wanted to I cannot build 3 purely magic resist items and be happy with the final build (Spirit visage is very good but {{item:3102}}  has little hp and the passive is kinda useless on tanks since it gets popped by poke, and other than that the items either are team focues like {{item:3190}} or provide just as much armor {{item:3026}}  ). Even poppy builds {{item:3065}} since there is no other good magic resist item for her.\n\nI am not confident that making more magic resist items will be all that is needed but it seems like a good place to start.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DemoGuide","date":"2017-01-19T01:59:39.833+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Meddler, what about bandaid fixes? For example, you see Lee, Vi, and Heca overperforming in the new jungle. You think that is due to jungle changes, and immediately think of ways to solve the problem. But it takes much more time since jungle is a complex system than simply nerfing them. So what about you do some simple nerfs to champions, with a note to yourself to remove them next patch? For example, Vi W proc deals 50% damage to monsters, same for Lee Sin Q and Hec Q. These changes reduce their jungle domination, and they are also kinda feel out of place, so removing them next patch wont feel bad for anybody.
