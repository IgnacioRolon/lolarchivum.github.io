If ADCs were more relying on Lifesteal for their sustain (for instance, in their third item), this overly high damage could potentially be delayed/not feel as overbearing.\r\n\r\nNon-Lifesteal ADC sustain options:\r\n\r\n- First up is Fleet Footwork. Despite its recent nerfs, it is still the most common Keystone on ADCs, and it especially synergizes with the Rapid Firecannon builds.\r\n- Second is all the sustain from the support position. There&#039;s the Relic Shield line, which amounts to a lot of sustain in the end, and gives that sustain option to a class of supports whose weakness normally is a lack of said sustain. \r\n- Third, and a lot of people don&#039;t have this on the front of their mind, is **Red Buff**. This buffs is usually reserved for the ADC from the midgame onwards. However, it features a really powerful sustain effect that allows ADCs to start every fight with full health, despite not dedicating resources into said sustain.\r\n\r\nWith these options, specifically itemizing Lifesteal is less necessary, freeing the ADCs up to sink 10k+ gold into offensive stats without having to worry about anything else.","replies":[{"poster":"LegitBusinessman","date":"2018-03-23T22:45:21.663+0000","up_votes":24,"down_votes":3,"body":"Teamfights end in one rotation.

As an adc you either have full health or you&#x27;re getting insta-gibbed.\n> \n> I wish it were not the case, but that&#x27;s what the game is now.\n\nI disagree with this. Far too often, I'll dive the back line in a teamfight and nearly kill the ADC before dying. They're at under 200 health, any stray ability would likely kill them. One would think that forces the enemy ADC out of the fight (or they have to take a risk to go back in), but instead they just have to wait 3 seconds for a shield cooldown to be available, then go in with the shield (in case they do get hit before they lifesteal) and they start attacking again and are full health within a few seconds.\n\nI would like to see that if I dive the enemy back line and nearly kill the enemy ADC, any of my allies can recognize that and flash on them to kill them. Like when the fight has been lost and our support is the lone person running away from the enemy top + adc (fight was 4 for 3), the support can choose to turn on the ADC and finish them, so the enemy team can't get any objective off of the won fight (instead of the top tanking baron or a few towers while the ADC melts them, all the while healing back to full health). Likewise you lose a fight mid, the enemy team's 4 survivors keep pushing down mid. The ADC was almost dead and built no lifesteal, but is always full by the time you respawn. So even though they overstay and have no lifesteal, you again can't one shot the ADC because they somehow healed to full.\n\nThere's a LOT of unappreciated value in the sustain that ADCs are getting that they don't need to buy for, and this definitely contributes to the issues people have with ADCs overall power level right now.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SpiritOfOdysseus","date":"2018-03-23T23:21:16.673+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":2,"body":"Meanwhile melees get the same lifesteal values as ADCs, but 95% of them don't have crit so they actually get lower values.\n\nYou guys should've been around in the early seasons, when lifesteal and spell vamp were so egregious that it was mandatory to carry it","replies":[{"poster":"Eedat","date":"2018-03-24T03:19:23.071+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"Every single ADC rushed BT first item","replies":[{"poster":"Spank the Fox","date":"2018-03-24T06:32:31.117+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Didn’t help BT was a stacking item that also gave more raw AD than IE","replies":[]},{"poster":"saltran","date":"2018-03-24T08:38:47.302+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Eedat,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=WVxkgEgR,comment-id=00030000,timestamp=2018-03-24T03:19:23.071+0000)\n>\n> Every single ADC rushed BT first item\n\nYeah, when with max stacks it gave me 100 AD.","replies":[{"poster":"Champion Skin","date":"2018-03-24T10:56:02.708+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Didn't it also give like 32% lifesteal or something crazy when at max stacks or is that just me not remembering it correctly?","replies":[{"poster":"XeroKimo","date":"2018-03-24T12:34:26.877+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It started at 12% stacked to 20%","replies":[{"poster":"Champion Skin","date":"2018-03-24T13:26:00.793+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh thanks for informing me\n\nAnd you seem to be correct from what I found if https://lol.gamepedia.com/The_Bloodthirster_(Item) is correct then it seems it was 25% then it was nerfed down to 20% and remained that way for a long time\n\nv1.0.0.136\nLife steal reduced to 12% from 15%\nLife steal per stack reduced to 0.2% from 0.25%\nNow only loses half stacks on death rather than all of them\n\nv4.10\n**REMOVED BLOODTHIRSTY PASSIVE: No longer grants bonus attack damage or lifesteal per unit kill**\nNEW BLOODTHIRSTIER PASSIVE: Lifesteal can now overheal, granting a bloody shield that absorbs 50-450 damage (based on champion level).

And that it is pretty much outclassed by the other rune in the same row that gives attack speed? (Even the tenacity one outclasses the lifesteal one, on champions that don't need attack speed) \n\nAlso, another reason why ADCs are pretty lifesteal independent is beacause supports give them a lot of survivability, enough to make lifesteal not necessary.","replies":[{"poster":"Z3Sleeper","date":"2018-03-24T00:59:48.255+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not necessarily, I see tons of people in high elo opt for Legend: Bloodline.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Thefrostyviking","date":"2018-03-24T14:35:38.527+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am fully aware that you need to stack it, hence i wrote \"if you are lucky at the time laning ends\", the meaning behind that being that if you get a good lane off then stacking it fully is not difficult.\n\nThe attackspeed rune is 18%, the lifeteal one is 8%......but if you think about this for a moment, how much lifesteal do you actually need? For most marksmen its around 10-15% to be in a good spot.\n\nBut if you have fleet footwork and a RFC an entire lifesteal item can become redundant with the bloodlines rune.'\n\nSo its becomes the choice of \"do i want a 18% attackspeed rune and having to buy a lifesteal item or do i want the 8% lifesteal rune and just whatever item i want instead of a lifesteal item?\". \n\nSo, if i can get away with it i in 10 outa 10 games prefer to get the heal setup with bloodlines rune and then just grab another damage item instead of a lifesteal one, or a outright tank item if some particular enemy champ is giving me a headache.\n\n\nSo with the heal setup and a AD heavy build or a ruunan´s hurricane i dont basically need any more lifesteal for a long,long time on most marksmen.\n\n\nAnd you clearly dont play any marksman champ a lot if you think its possible to get away without any healing or just fleet footwork alone, i can tell you right now, it's completely impossible against any tank with thornmail or any long range mage that pokes a lot.\n\nHell, its hard to just get through laning against some mage support like Xerath, brand or Zyra without a high healing page and sometimes even a vamp scepter early depending on how good they are at landing shots.\n\n\nThe only time lifesteal isn't needed is when the enemy team doesnt have the ability to ever reach or poke you and they dont have any tanks with thornmail, otherwise its always needed. \n\nFor illustrative purposes, i while playing Ashe shooting a rammus with thornmail+ninja tabi+bit of health for items and his W up in a skirmish at 2 items....lets say, IE+Ruunan, can in the time i deal  1/3rd of his health i will have lost roughly 50-70% of mine even with a support like nami healing me or one like Janna giving me a shield.\n\nMarksmen are actually hella fragile, glass cannons even and they have the damage to boot, and while some supports makes it hard to hit them they still explode extremely fast if actually hit.\n\nThats why so many are so into going fleet footwork+overheal, the movespeed buff makes avoiding damage worlds easier and the barrier generated from overheal helps one endure poke and just survive a lot better.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"xXCairoKingXx","date":"2018-03-24T07:18:34.265+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its called sustained damage, are you saying assassins should have lifesteal or vamp wouldnt make sense","replies":[{"poster":"ProfDrDeath","date":"2018-03-24T07:27:03.129+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"No?\n\nI am saying that ADCs should have more incentives to go for bought Lifesteal.
