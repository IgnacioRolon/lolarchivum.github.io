{"poster":"not a starburst","date":"2014-12-20T23:20:26.219+0000","title":"List of Champions that need some Riot Love.","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":7,"down_votes":3,"body":"This is just a list of champions that need work of some sort. This is strictly my two bits from what I've seen on League over time, or advice from veteran players. I just thought other people might want to see this and comment on it. I'm aware some of these champions have reworks pending, but I put them down anyway, because remember, Sion rework took something like two years. Riot does good work, and I'm confident they'll get around to most or all of this eventually- but it's going to take a while, probably.\r\n-----\r\n{{champion:12}} Could use some visual updating. His model's not too bad, so he's kinda low priority, but even so I'm sure Alistair players would appreciate it.\r\n{{champion:32}} Again, his model's pretty old, so it could certainly use some touching up.\r\n{{champion:34}}  Likewise. Anivia is *especially* important, because she's a *pheonix* made out of *ice*. She could look infinitely cooler.\r\n{{champion:268}} Bugs. Bugs EVERYWHERE. No, but seriously. His ult and kit are notorious for having bugs here, there, and everywhere. Riot's doing their best, though, so I'm not going to grumble too much about it. On a more serious note, his soldiers are annoyingly uninteractive. Your options against them consist of: running away. That's not terribly fun and it makes for some predictable and boring gameplay.\r\n{{champion:31}} His model is... bleeeaaagh. *Terrible*. Like, completely awful. He looks like an overgrown lizard, and his cast animations are *way* too long. It's all the telegraphed forewarning of Sion and none of the damage or early cast ability. His kit, like Sion’s, needs CC for his CC to be fully effective, which is a pretty silly situation for a tank to be in unless they have some way to balance that. It used to be that maxing Q was the way to go, but the advent of every champion having a dash or jump of some sort meant that he could never land it.\r\n{{champion:9}} He's not scary enough, both with his in-game texture, splash art, and VO. You could replace his VO with complete silence and he'd be much scarier, really. Riot fix pls.\r\n{{champion:114}}: Ult. Do something about it. The untargetable AoE damage with Hydra is very painful, and lifesteal makes is so she heals up far too easily. Currently, she seems to have slipped through the cracks for this meta, but I suspect she'll make a return at some point. The damage even without Hydra is painful and the HP return is even more so.\r\n{{champion:3}} Yeah, he's continually edging towards not viable. If it weren't for his ult, which is ridiculously scary, I'd put him under urgent. Relying on your mid lane opponent being AP is increasingly a bad idea. Zed and Talon are picked every game where they're not banned, and the easiest way to counter this dude is just running ADC mid if those two are banned.\r\n{{champion:150}}: Could his kit get possibly get any more overloaded? Gnar does it all. He tanks, he pokes, he speeds, he has health shred, he has burst. The ranged top meta is a bad meta. It gives melee champions virtually nowhere to go. Gnar is a burning problem because he counters the people that are *supposed* to go top: bruisers and tanks. And there just aren't any other lanes for bruisers and tanks to go in, really, unless you're jungle suitable, which is rare as long as a certain blind monk is hanging around.\r\n{{champion:120}} He's a unique champion with a lot of interesting strengths and good play potential, but he's just too weak. He just needs a few number tweaks, probably to help his sustain, and he'll be back in business in no time.\r\n{{champion:64}} See the other 5 trillion billion comments about Lee. He's been overtuned since release.\r\n{{champion:25}} Her snare is just so *long*. The CC on it is very strong, since positioning is very important now, and with mobility often dictating teamfights, Morgana's snare is possibly even stronger than before.\r\n{{champion:2}} He still exists? I saw an Olaf a week or two ago. Prior to that, the last time was two months ago, I think. He needs buffs, or he's just going to be made utterly irrelevant by people like Jax and Gnar who just avoid his damage and then turn around and murder him.\r\n{{champion:78}} Her ult is game-breaking. Invincibility is a very dangerous mechanic to have on a champion, and Poppy's has a legendary reputation for being extremely toxic in lategame teamfights.\r\n{{champion:421}} Too cool. Rito nerf pls.\r\n{{champion:6}} This guy is famous for being unloved. Top he usually gets wrecked by whoever because he has no escapes, bot, he gets outranged, mid, he gets bursted, and the jungle is just too hard on him. He's mediocre at everything and can't usually carry hard enough to make up for it even if he does get fed. He still *works*, just not particularly well.\r\n{{champion:110}} This guy is close to being on par with other ADC's. He literally needs just a little buff to make him as good as the others. He's very close.\r\n{{champion:161}} No escapes means this dude is a dead eye walking. The lack of extra passives to help him out makes him tough to play and win with. With practically anybody able to dash into his face, he can't do much against the enemy team, and his ult is comically easy to interrupt lategame. Vi and Braum say hello.\r\n{{champion:238}} His early game is too safe for how strong he is late. He farms far too easily and far too safely early for how powerful he becomes late. The problem is that shadow + shruikens means he can farm with little to no danger. The fact that he doesn't use mana means he can basically get a lifesteal item then lane forever.\r\n-----\r\n**PRETTY URGENT CASES**\r\n{{champion:28}} She's not at all good in the new jungle. No sustain, no tank, no great AS buffs. She needs love, desperately.\r\n{{champion:429}} She counters every melee champion I can think of except maybe Lee Sin, but that's because Lee Sin is Lee Sin, the Blind Monk. She's contributing to both mobility creep and the ranged meta- a serious problem for anyone melee. She’s pretty much the growing problem in League in a nutshell- melee champions just get wrecked by the ADC, and immobile champions get destroyed by ones with better mobility.\r\n{{champion:96}} How the mighty fall. Now that everybody and their mother can shred tanks with BoTRK, Black Cleaver, Last Whisper (of the item design team), DFG, and Void Staff, his tank-shredding abilities are irrelevant. His lack of defense or mobility means that he just gets blown up instantaneously by whoever gets to him first.\r\n{{champion:19}} His ult is so strong that they had to gut his kit to make room for it. Also, the on-hit part makes it really broken with any on-hit items like botrk, wit's end, and whatever they're calling feral flare now. He needs a kit rework desperately because he's practically impossible to balance.\r\n{{champion:157}} Who on earth thought they could possibly balance a champion around *doubled crit chance* in his passive? It doesn’t even interact with the rest of his kit, it just gives him stupid amounts of damage for free with IE. The rest of his kit is fine, interesting even, and he offers both good potential for play and counterplay- but his free crits are painfully difficult to work around. There's no chance Yasuo will ever be balanced- either he'll be so badly nerfed his free crits won't matter or he'll be ridiculous.\r\n{{champion:83}} He's been out of free-week rotation for *two seasons* now; that's a pretty solid testament to how skewed he is. Granted, he’s in need of Sion-level work, but at least put him back on free rotation so people can just try him out, as he’s currently lying in a dark unloved corner.\r\n-----\r\nAgain, just my perspective. If you disagree or you have someone you think should probably be up here, I'd really like to hear your thoughts.","replies":[{"poster":"IlyaK1986","date":"2014-12-21T01:27:13.788+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Diana?
