I'm not going to couch my terms nicely or give specifics, because that's been done before.\nI believe that currently, Riot's designers:\n\n* Have replaced the strategic engagements of older League with a battle of reflex and reaction time, weakening the more cerebral portions of League in exchange for flashier play potential, which threatens to damage League's core element of gameplay, which still is *strategy*, not *speed*,\n\n* Have created mobility champions that excel at counterplay simply by virtue of being mobile instead of having specific counterplay abilities, and therefore thrive in an environment where most skills are now skillshots and where pure tanks, with their more reliable CC, are weak,\n\n* Have largely reduced point-and-click CC, the largest counter to mobility, further buffing mobility champions,\n\n* Produce champions whose kits give them far too many options on what they do and how they do it, at great expense to champions with more clearly defined weaknesses, because generalist champions are very easily able to use their large number of abilities to find and capitalize on the weaknesses of other champions while still remaining extremely safe,\n\n* Produce champions that do not have a true weakness, or have a weakness that is largely irrelevant, who proceed to dominate the meta until they have to be nerfed and then become simply mediocre at everything and therefore useless,\n\n* Often produce uninspired solutions to problematic portions of a champion's kit that could easily be addressed with a more creative solution rather than a flat nerf or buff,\n\n* Often buff champions after release, before the playerbase has fully adapted to that champion and learned how to play them, making them ludicrously strong when the playerbase adapts,\n\n* Have not fixed some very obviously overtuned champions at the expense of every other champion.\n\n* Have failed to clearly and reasonably address the *absolutely* devastated lore,\n\n* Often stonewall community feedback, leading to considerable frustration when *nothing happens* despite loud, continued, unanimous community feedback asking for a change.\n\nRiot, I don't need to sing your praises about what you've done right. I believe that there are a *lot* of things you have done and presumably will continue to do right, and I appreciate the thought you put into your work. \n\nFor what it's worth? You're my favorite game company, and if I didn't think you were good, I wouldn't tell you what I thought, because I wouldn't care at all. Your power has always been listening to your playerbase and acting for feedback. I ask you to continue doing that, despite that not being strictly necessary, because I believe it is integral to the community you have built. I would hate to see Riot fall into the trap of 'we've got 'em, now we can ignore them' and then throw us under the bus. So far, that's been far from the case, but recent changes have worried me.\n\nThank you for your time.\n\nEDIT: And thank you for all the upvotes. Wow.

Sometimes (weak enemy top lane, farm oriented team comp, enemy has protect-the-kog team comp) he is an awesome pick. Sometimes (strong enemy top lane, facing mobility, enemy has multiple strongly scaling champions) he is a weak pick.\n\nThis is how Dota is balanced as well. Almost everyone is the best pick ever in certain circumstances and completely useless in certain other circumstances.\n\nThe glut of champions that are good at everything (starting at around champion 100 - Jayce; there was a time when bruisers had all the tools as an answer to ranged dominance but the overload didn't creep into other roles, now it does) has made champion select irrelevant except as a place to ban/secure the champions with the highest numbers, because there is no longer a point in picking strategically.\n\nThis actually makes balance issues *worse*. When there is no reason to pick one champion over another unless its stats are better, the champion that is even slightly better at its role becomes overwhelmingly strong because there is no weakness for other champions to exploit. This is why balance is so bad in S5. Most champions are not actually shit, but they have no answer to a champion that is just 5% better across the board.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Raptamei","date":"2015-02-21T15:37:05.436+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Retillin,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=tudnEmGv,comment-id=000000010000,timestamp=2015-02-21T15:11:48.834+0000)\n>\n> What do you mean by this?\n\nHe means people need to stop equating counterplay with \"can I dodge it\".

However, the problem remains that they are rebalancing Veigar in terms of other \"normal\" champions, which means that he will now be even more useless against the favoured high-mobility top picks.\n\nI don't think that's problem with the idea behind the Veigar rework, though.

Their platform hasn't been successful at increasing or fixing the communication issues. I don't even think that the format matters so much as nothing is addressing the elephant in the room. Communication on this scale takes dedication. And I get that developers should be dedicated to their job, which isn't necessarily communication. So how will this dedication crisis be resolved?\n\nYou've already shot down CM's, so I will suggest something that I know your gut will instinctively shoot down. Bring back the Riot Ambassadors:\n\n>ARE YOU INSAYAN PRYOTRA!?!?!?! NEVAR AGAIN!!!!\n\nOkay, yeah, the old version of the ambassadors flopped, but I feel the idea behind them was spot on. They were not designed to replace Rioters on the forums. They were designed to be in betweens, effectively bridges between the community and the various parts of Riot. However, they were implemented in the worst possible way, more like walls between the community and Riot, ultimately leading to their failure. With proper implementation, that initial idea could very well be highly sucessful.\n\nSo, with that in mind, what should the new \"Ambassadors\" do differently?\n\n* **No More Copy Pasta** - I think we can all agree that Copy pasta responses generally don't play well with large scale communications. Make them more Human, and allow them to type their own sentences.\n\n* **More \"Fowarded to X department\"** - This way we can know when and who got the info sent to them.\n\n* **Personalized names** - Allow them to have their own personalities. Don't make them just sign for the same account. That's just dumb.\n\n* **New color for posts** - Kinda like the wrenchmen get that special orange name, allow them to get their own color to distinguish them from players, but also not forcing them up on the Red Tracker for simple \"forwarded\" messages.\n\n* **Don't make them Answer for riot** - Instead, give some general FAQ's for some of the departments that are easy to find, so that if it is a question that has been answered 100 times before, the answer can be easily found. If they are easily found, the community can link them for the player and point out where the answer is, so that nobody at Riot needs to waste time answering \"Do Unique Passives Stack?\" or other obvious questions.\n\nIn the end, I feel that the Ambassador's could have worked as imagined. As implemented, they were more like moderators that tried to keep the forums clean of controversial topics. Keeping true to the idea should have better results in further implementations. And no, you don't have to keep the name \"Ambassadors\" if you don't want to. =P","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2015-02-22T17:53:45.887+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Tamat,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=tudnEmGv,comment-id=002e,timestamp=2015-02-22T12:43:28.198+0000)\n> Thanks for the post, I hope the development team jumps in here at some point to give you their 2 cents.\n\nSo do I, Tamat.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Thefriendlyorc","date":"2015-02-21T06:53:06.871+0000","up_votes":49,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a person who has been playing LoL a long time I remember when a dash was a significant thing.

Thank you for the collection of feedback. \n\n> I believe that currently, Riot's designers:\n> \n> * Have replaced the strategic engagements of older League with a battle of reflex and reaction time, weakening the more cerebral portions of League in exchange for flashier play potential, which threatens to damage League's core element of gameplay, which still is *strategy*, not *speed*,\n\nThis is the most interesting topic to me so forgive me if I delve in a bit.  What strategic engagements of yesteryear are you yearning for?  When I've been in this conversation internally it boils down to, \"Fiddlesticks could turn the game around with a good ultimate and there were global teams,\" and now that doesn't necessarily ring as true. Is that because the game has fundamentally changed? Certainly, Fiddle's fear doesn't last as long and there are more available countermeasures... but to me it's primarily a function of players getting faster, and partly due to them being more mobile. Interrupting an ultimate is a lot more feasible now, in large part because of people's quick reactions and in some part because people have got better at the strategy, and know how to avoid the big surprise parties.  \n\nI feel like other strategic elements of the game have become more and more prevalent in League.  Trinkets helped more people buy into the vision game, and a year later, there's still an upwards trend in number of wards placed and destroyed.  \n\nS2015 brought about more focus on objectives.  Dragon became 'the thing'.  Much of competitive play has balanced out in terms of people's talent. You can't count on people winning lane consistently, you have to out-rotate and out-vision.  \n\nI guess this loops back around to: what are the strategic elements that are being underplayed?  What could we bring back into the fold?\n\n> (paraphrasing a ton): champs are too generally strong, without any actual weakness, too much mobility creates free counterplay, point & click CC is down\n\nI don't have a lot to add to these points.  GC talked a bit about mobility over here: http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/2TavB1Ax-dear-riot-can-we-get-a-straight-no-nonsense-description-of-what-your-vision-for-this-game-is?comment=0016 earlier today.  I can say you're right, we're reducing targeted CC.  The goal obviously isn't to make mobile people stronger, but that is a side effect and we should be cognizant of that.  \n\nI know it's also a goal of the champion team to have actual weaknesses on their champions. To the extent that isn't the case, your feedback and call-outs are warranted.  \n\n> * Often produce uninspired solutions to problematic portions of a champion's kit that could easily be addressed with a more creative solution rather than a flat nerf or buff,\n\nThe more creative a solution, generally  the more divisive it will be and the harder to finalize.  I am often a proponent of less creative changes (straight tuning), when champs are simply out of line but perhaps that's why that's not my job. ;)  \n\n> * Often buff champions after release, before the playerbase has fully adapted to that champion and learned how to play them, making them ludicrously strong when the playerbase adapts,\n\nGuilty as charged.  It is frequently very difficult to avoid.  A designer has spent around a year on a champion.  It's released, they suddenly see tons on tons of players using the champion. They spot some quality of life fixes they can make. They are going to make them, because they just make the champion holistically better. Then it's a question of, \"should we 'compensation' nerf this champion along with these QoL changes?\" and since the community thinks the champion is underwhelming, the answer is frequently no.  And then there are other times we miscalculate.\n\n> * Have not fixed some very obviously overtuned champions at the expense of every other champion.\n\nAre we talking the Lee Sin variety or some separate beast?  Generally agreed that some champions stick around too long.  \n\n> * Have failed to clearly and reasonably address the *absolutely* devastated lore,\n\nThis is way out of my wheelhouse, sorry. :( \n\n> * Often stonewall community feedback, leading to considerable frustration when *nothing happens* despite loud, continued, unanimous community feedback asking for a change.\n\nThis is certainly never our intent.  Not all feedback will be acted on, but on the flipside: our aim is to make the game better for players.  We only know that the game is better/worse based on your feedback. I do say 'your' in a very general sense, though.  There have been instances when these forums have been much more negative about a change than the general populace (as taken from surveys in the game).   I think the more constructive posts like yours we have and the more dialogue we create, the better off the game will be.  \n\n> For what it's worth? You're my favorite game company, and if I didn't think you were good, I wouldn't tell you what I thought, because I wouldn't care at all. \n\nThank you for caring!  We care, too.

I never expect Riot to act on everything that gets posted on the boards. That said, There are alot of quality pieces that go un-commented on, and some of it feedback that turns out to be spot on, and yet we rarely see anything from that department. Dialogue is a 2 way street, and even saying \"yeah.... NO.\" is better than not even posting. Ok, maybe not necessarily better, but knowing that a relevant Rioter has seen it helps set alot of people at ease. And currently, there just isn't any way to know if anyone that is relevant has seen it unless they post.\n\n>This is way out of my wheelhouse, sorry. :(\n\nDoes this wheel house still exist in Riot? The only department quieter than them is the legal department. Seriously, even your pricing guys talk more than them, and they only do when pagan rituals are invoked. Another issue that ties in to the above, I guess, and I know it isn't your wheel house. But it's SUPER frustrating not being able to talk about patching things up between the community and them *because they never have a discussion with us*.\n\n>Are we talking the Lee Sin variety or some separate beast? Generally agreed that some champions stick around too long.\n\nI'm curious on the definition of \"Lee Sin variety\". Does he live in his own league, or is there a Lee and Co. that you are referring to?\n\nBtw, there are others that are pretty painfully obviously out of line. Kat maintaining both an incredible play rate *and* high winrate? Constant complaining at all levels of play about Kalista? *Notice the high mobility trend?*\n\n>The more creative a solution, generally the more divisive it will be and the harder to finalize. I am often a proponent of less creative changes (straight tuning), when champs are simply out of line but perhaps that's why that's not my job. ;)\n\nAs a counterpoint, sometimes the more \"creative\" fixes aren't straight buffs/nerfs but still very easy to implement and test. As an example, lets use Kallista's over the top mobility. The easy solution would be to just gut her hop range so that people have a way to catch up. A creative fix would be to apply slows to the hops, so that she hops \"slower\" or just travels less distance during the hop. Probably a bad example because I'm tired as hell, but I hope you see the point.\n\n>I guess this loops back around to: what are the strategic elements that are being underplayed? What could we bring back into the fold?\n\nMobility has all but killed the concept of \"out of position\" or those \"gotcha\" ults where being caught by said ult is devastating. For example, J4's ult back on it's release was *very* scary. Now a days he uses it to execute, because we all know he aint catching jack in League of Gapclosers. Another example is nunu's ult. I've seen Nunu's get off the *perfect* EMPIIIIRE ult on the enemy team, only for them to pop it on only 1 person because everyone hopped out of it. There is also Anivia catching out people in her wall, deviding the team perfectly only for the exposed ones to hop over and back to safety, even though their bad positioning should have been punished League of Unending Mobility allows them a free pass. I've seen really cool things in this game basically become irrelevant due to mobility. The fact that flash *still* exists in this game creates a rich get richer experience, and as a result all but a select few champions carry Flash. And even then, it's a viable choice.\n---\nI'm tired. Maybe sleep mode will help. BEEP *Booooop*.","replies":[{"poster":"Dopeson","date":"2015-02-23T10:55:22.985+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> There is also Anivia catching out people in her wall, dividing the team perfectly only for the exposed ones to hop over and back to safety..... their bad positioning should have been punished League of Unending Mobility allows them a free pass....\n\nWhile I agree with a lot of your points on mobility and how it has made some forms of engagement and fighting obsolete there is something that I think a lot of people forget, so I am going to play devils advocate here:\n\nPerhaps those players are only in that position because they are aware their mobility will save them. Its the same idea as someone who has flash on CD playing more cautiously than when they have flash up. A common issue in low-mid tier play are people acting as if flash and jumps don't exist and believing they got cheated out of a kill when the enemy player uses that ability to avoid a CC or ability. There are some champs who definitely do abuse their mobility to avoid situations that should otherwise get them killed (lee sin/nidalee) but that is merely because they know that safety net is there which lets them throw caution to the wind.\n\nThe bigger issue in this situation (excluding the nid/lee/kassadin) is that less mobile champs tend to have their weakness defined by this ability the mobile champ is probably dodging. So if you are Anivia  who uses Q or W you are extremely vulnerable while the enemy mobile champ can generally miss abilities and escape despite their mistake.. If you are an Ashe and the Lucian dodges your ult you cant win that fight. Meanwhile if you are the Ashe and dodge Lucians Q W or R he can choose whether he wants to fight. Basically the more mobile champ always dictates when a fight is going to happen, and can choose a situation that is more favorable to them. This situation can be countered by having a team built around your weakness, but in a Solo Q situation players frequently wont want to choose a Janna or Thresh just because you chose Anivia or Ashe.\n\nThe solution I see to this is actually not as much in champ balance as it is in item design. Ashe will never be as good as Graves or Lucian because with the same items Graves and Lucian offer burst and mobility with only a slight drop in damage over time. If item diversity did more to separate damage potential then you would see a purpose for less mobile champs if they offered something more than novelty. If Ahri and Brand are rushing the same items with similar damage, but Ahri lets me have all that safety then why would I choose Brand. To bring out this item diversity, I think stats need to be stripped from a lot of higher tier items so that the order you rush an item has more of an impact on the early and mid games. Maybe if Morello's only gave mana and CDR but less AP Ahri would go for a more AP focused item. Then in the mid game Brand could be useful by using more spells with CDR and not running oom while Ahri would hit harder but be able to use her spells less.","replies":[{"poster":"Pryotra","date":"2015-02-23T16:30:39.097+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Maybe if Morello's only gave mana and CDR but less AP Ahri would go for a more AP focused item. Then in the mid game Brand could be useful by using more spells with CDR and not running oom while Ahri would hit harder but be able to use her spells less.\n\nSorry, It really bugs me that morello's became THE mana regen item. Shouldn't that have been athenes?\n\n>Perhaps those players are only in that position because they are aware their mobility will save them.\n\nWhich is the exact problem of losing the cerebral value in the game. Yes, you could argue it's more cerebral to factor it in, but Honestly that isn't how pro's are looking at it. They don't play Anivia because the Wall is effectively not good due to all the mobility, and therefore have effectively 3 spells while still being immobile. They don't use J4 for the terrain and setup potential of his cataclysm, because that setup potential hardly exists anymore.\n\nThis over abundance of mobility needs to end if these abilities are going to find value again. A good start would be removing flash, and compensating immobile champs that relied on it with either range or something else. That said, for the Hyper-mobile, they are going to need to be equalized.\n\n>The bigger issue in this situation (excluding the nid/lee/kassadin) is that less mobile champs tend to have their weakness defined by this ability the mobile champ is probably dodging.\n\nActually I don't think there weaknesses defined by it, but rather their strengths are being negated. For example, take ashe vs kallista. Ashe really just effectively loses her slow, which is her \"big strength\" that defines her, and her stun becomes infinitely harder to land, which is her \"great equalizer\". Meanwhile, assuming the support is next to Kallista, Kallista still has an easy time landing her entire kit because Ashe doesn't have the mobility to dodge, especially with Kallista's press button slow.\n\n>The solution I see to this is actually not as much in champ balance as it is in item design. Ashe will never be as good as Graves or Lucian because with the same items Graves and Lucian offer burst and mobility with only a slight drop in damage over time.\n\nI don't think this is a solution, and Riot agrees. They have experimented with specialized itemization on a few champs, and everytime it was either not worth it or a huge must buy, but never a niche thing and sometimes still not necessarily worth it in the long run. They have said repeatedly that they don't like this solution as it \"makes it hard to make builds when you have to think if ashe has access to that or not\". And if they did start making items with some form of \"anti-mobility clause\" you will find that the item would have to give pretty terrible stats for mobile champs to not pick it up, and even then if you did then even the immobile would likely not want it either. This simply isn't a good solution.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"InsaneSamurai","date":"2015-02-23T10:14:50.331+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"Very glad to see red posts in here, and generally the post is very awesome :)\n\nOne thing I had to mention though, is it seems like you politician dodged the Lee thing, which scares me.  :P","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Sotere","date":"2015-02-24T08:44:50.077+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":11,"body":"I did kind of dodge it!

It's less of a battle of skill *with the champions themselves* or cooperation and more a battle of reflex. And whoever is playing the champion which gives you the most power for your reaction time. I played Kalista a few times, and I was garbage at her, tbh, yet I won a *lot* of engages, not because I was skilled, or particularly clever, but because Kalista has a ton of mobility and I was able to leverage that mobility by, well, clicking really fast, to just avoid damage and win fights simply by virtue of not getting hit. I mean, I wasn't being **strategic**. I wasn't positioning very well, I wasn't focusing the right people 100% of the time, and I wasn't stomping lane, but I won pretty hard despite all of that because I had just had like three Cokes and had artificially jacked up my reflexes into the realm of slow-mo arrow catching and Legolas sniping.\nThe game itself seems to be doing great. That's not really my complaint in terms of strategic diversity (except maybe itemization and jungle diversity but wow that is another post entirely). My worry is that the *champions* in the game are making it less about strategy and more about speed and reflex, or the champions are so strong they force the meta and therefore much of the game to revolve around them.\nBut, you know, this is just my two bits.
