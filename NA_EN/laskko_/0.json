Someone with ability damage, rather than someone who relies on basic attacks. Renekton and Darius have enough sustain and innate tank to survive to level 2, where they can engage and pump out a bit of damage, and their main source of damage is from their bread-n-butter Q spells. \n\nOption 2 is where you take someone who can deal with him in equal measure. He's got ranged harass? Give him ranged harass of your own. Teemo, Ryze, Swain, etc. are all good at throwing damage at him from far away, with stuff that gets through his passive. Something to remember here is that these champions tend to not be as good in combat when Panth inevitably hard engages and commits to a fight. The idea here is to keep the fight poke-based. Whittle him down from range to make him afraid to get closer, and stay out of his way when your stuff is on cooldown. \n\nOption 3 is where you take a hypercarry and turtle it out. Grab Irelia, Gangplank, or whomever you want, and then just wait it out. Take Corrupting Potion or Doran's Shield, and just last hit to the best of your ability. This is more difficult in the beginning, and tends to be the more dangerous path, since Panth has a lot of mid-game power. The idea is that you only want to stay on the fringes of combat. Grab the minions that you can, but don't go too deep for just one or two. If you get chunked down for such a small thing, you're going to be at more of a disadvantage than before. \n\nAlso remember that top laners can smell fear. Mid lane and bot lane are different, because they either push the waves out all the time, or they have a support protecting them, but up there, it's just you, the enemy, and waves to manage. Top laners usually grow to know when their opponent is afraid to engage, and they capitalise on it, moving in when you least expect it. In top lane, -always- expect the engage. In time, you'll  also know the signals for when you should press your advantage or not.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SquashCannon","date":"2017-01-12T21:52:54.673+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Zen Ineth,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=z1K9iFZA,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2017-01-12T16:18:07.489+0000)\n>\n> Lane bullies exist as a counter to the typical late-game scaling hypercarry.

Like a camille's double autoattack reset **BROKEN** but she has some sort of sustain but that's not what makes her a bully. Renekton is a bully for having 2 dashes for free trades. It's VERY hard to out trade a renekton unless you're a tryndamere or someone along the lines.","replies":[{"poster":"singiel38","date":"2017-01-12T18:00:32.800+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you try to heal yourself with minions, champs with good range can poke to delete this sustain, but it's hard.","replies":[{"poster":"Gallows madness","date":"2017-01-12T18:35:24.582+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"True, ranged champions are a struggle to fight for some champions but then if we refer it to that way I'll bring up 3 scenarios where it all depends on skill if that's the case. \n\nRenekton vs Jayce. when renekton uses his dash right ontop of jayce if he doesn't e *knockback* the renekton in time, he will be punished severely for it but if you freeze the lane on your side, then you can have him overextend and all in him ... As long as he doesn't E at the right time. Basically his dash as the time.\n\nRenekton vs Quinn... Oh Boi this is quite the hard one. If the renekton can't w quinn before she uses e then rip renekton. She will destroy renekton if he doesn't play smart to force her to overextend or stay longer for minions. \n\nRenekton vs Teemo. This one is actually quite easy to tell, renekton has to play safe till lvl 3 and when the teemo q's you, you actually let him blind u then u wait out the blind in lane and after it's over you should be on top of him through his auto animations or your dash and w and q him immediately. Playing smart and losing a few cs is cool as renekton at lvl 1 but you can't take a lot of damage till you hit lvl 2-3 when you can pressure the teemo. \n\n\nNow if your in mid of laning phase, let's say 11 mins which is usually near the end of laning phase for some champs. You have a black cleaver as renekton but you have 65 fury and you have first turret and at 1/3 health to a full health teemo with the build for liandry's components *the mask* with tier 1 boots,  and has died 1 time to you and is 15 cs under you. What would you do, with the wave froze near his turret but you don't have vision of the jungler to go back? well, I'd go to scuttle or go get a honey fruit at the time and sustain q the scuttle if you do it. If both are up, go get them, and set a deep ward in the tri on either side. (after blue or near red side place it in that bush that shows the 3 paths going up to krugs)\n\n\nThis should help you sustain back up with it.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"DarkPh0enix","date":"2017-01-12T16:25:36.889+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"To make sure snowball champions don't snowball","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fluffeh","date":"2017-01-12T15:58:18.015+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Theyre on a different power curve. Lane bullies have strong early-mid presence but grow weaker as the game progresses(comparatively, they dont lose gold or stats). Since youre new that means nobody in your elo knows how to end a game before 40 minutes which puts lane bullies at their weakest, unfortunately people at your elo also tend to shovel ludicrous amounts of gold into these bullies making them impossible to deal with.\n\nThe primary counterplay to a bully is \"dont die\" Thats the golden rule. If you pick a scaling champion(A tank for example, like poppy) then youre getting stronger than him by just last hitting(eventually). Speaking of last hitting, dont die for them. Missing a few cs is much better than giving more gold and experience to somebody who --needs- it to contribute to the game. \n\nSince this is low elo they wont have any knowledge of lane mechanics and will likely shove the wave into your turret endlessly, your main goal here is to maximize how many last hits you can get from the tower and hold out for the jungler who will let you turn the tables on the bully. If he succesfully ganks enough you can in turn bully the bully and also enjoy your scaling into late game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Quepha","date":"2017-01-13T02:46:01.467+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To diversify strategy.\n\nYou play a champion that shuts them down in lane either by being a bigger lane bully or countering their kit OR you farm, stall and outscale them in teamfights.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Papa Slothy","date":"2017-01-13T01:29:42.136+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"they exist as counters to strong late game champions, easiest way to beat them is to lose to them.

Strategically, they're important to have because they're great at setting other champions behind, especially late-game champions, and can also help allies snowball in order to close games out earlier. They're also good comfort picks for players who want an easier laning phase, since playing them then can often be less stress-inducing than the likes of, say, Karthus or Singed, who start out really rough and only start getting really strong later on.\n\nDealing with a lane bully depends on the champion you're picking, your team and how you're doing. Ideally, you'd want to play defensively and try to relieve some pressure with ganks: if you're also playing an early game champion, use any advantage you can get to snowball over them, and if you're playing a mid- or late-game champion, try your best to survive until the laning phase ends, whereupon you can rotate to another lane. A key thing to remember is that, when playing against lane bullies, it's usually about you reacting to their plays, and not the opposite: unless you are sure that you have a large advantage, don't force trades or all ins, and remember that merely surviving against them is a victory, as you'll outscale them later on. If you go through the laning phase against a lane bully and end up even with them, or even a little bit behind, you've won against them, and aiming for that tends to be significantly more reliable, if less exciting, than trying to get a kill lead over them. What you should avoid is going too aggressive and feeding your opponent kills, which will usually let them snowball hard enough to become a nuisance in the mid game as well.","replies":[]},{"poster":"iPooUnicorns","date":"2017-01-12T19:59:07.446+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So champions like Nasus are kept in check.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Laskko ","date":"2017-01-12T16:26:04.003+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the help.
