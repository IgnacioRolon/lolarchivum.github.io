For instance, you go on 5 vs 5 and then a random map is automatically selected after matchmaking and before selecting champions.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"paisy","date":"2017-05-16T15:32:41.523+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd like alternating 5v5 maps","replies":[]},{"poster":"Elkington VI","date":"2017-05-16T15:41:07.044+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot has tried this before, but they're not willing to put any effort into maintaining the maps, so people lose interest, and eventually the map is removed.

Sure, but they're staggered enough to sink in and be accepted. Hanamura is probably the one that sparked the harshest reaction so far simply because of how boring it is.\n\nLeague of Legends has gone through a few different map changes, significant enough to be a new map each time. However, I do actually think the game could benefit from some new maps. Hell, completely retool Twisted Treeline! Keep it a 2-lane 3v3 and shake up its formula. I actually prefer that map to Summoner's Rift, funnily.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ObscureParticle","date":"2017-05-15T20:58:27.534+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not \"out of the asshole\", just a few (2-4) so that it's not ALWAYS the same.","replies":[{"poster":"Erockandroll","date":"2017-05-15T21:34:26.891+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ObscureParticle,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=eV8K9BZd,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2017-05-15T20:58:27.534+0000)\n>\n> Not &quot;out of the asshole&quot;, just a few (2-4) so that it&#x27;s not ALWAYS the same.\n\n\"Welcome to the Cosmic Ruins\"\n\nBut okay, Riot is pretty much done with making maps, outside of the RGMQ. After putting out a measly 3 alternative maps, they had to retire one of them (Crystal scar) because they couldn't justify supporting it. They were also working on a 1v1 map called magma chamber, which got canceled based on the poor numbers from the 1v1 and 2v2s on Snowdown showdown. \n\nThere's simply not enough support to justify making new maps as permanent game features. And actually supporting multiple maps on a balance level is too taxing on Riot's resources. So if a champ becomes OP on a specific map, tough luck.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Hyperiön","date":"2017-05-16T15:16:55.050+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If they were to do more maps, they would literally be the same thing, just different colors.\n\nKind of like with the snow one.\n\nThey can't have different maps and expect people to play on the same level in each map.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KakitaMike","date":"2017-05-16T15:13:42.623+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"People should go play HotS if they want a variety of maps.
