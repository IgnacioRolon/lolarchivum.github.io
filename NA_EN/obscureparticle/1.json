There are too many flaws in his kit that can be exploited by the enemy team. They also mess with his builds. Right now, DotKaiser is basically a slightly tanker than average ap mage with no range. He only has tankiness when he is in a 1v1 fight and the shield isn't instantly deleted. He needs to have damage and tankiness if he can overcome the debilitations of having no mobility or cc. You can't just give him damage and situational tankiness. Personally, I would like to see his ult completely changed. It fits thematically, but it reliant on so many different factors that it is unreliable. Right now, its purpose is to finish people off who are running away or to get a 6v4 team fight after you gangbang someone. I would like him to get an ult that lets him finish people off or have a way to force fights. Not like a jargon multi, but something like ilaio e maybe.\nFeel free to disagree with me and argue!","replies":[{"poster":"BuppleBg","date":"2017-09-04T11:03:45.577+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see this comment after 4 months but i got this thing in my head that if they remove his ult he will be good but not fun i want a fun champ interesting something that you can try with not a champ that got the same things again and again ...\nMordekaiser is so unique from 3 things his passive his W and MOST OF ALL his ult i still wanna see how nautalius is doing a moon walk.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ObscureParticle","date":"2017-04-26T21:11:00.887+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Seem's like your builds are somewhat different than mine. Seems like you go for full AP while i normally equip SV and Deadman (or Thornmail depending on match up), which makes him a little tankier, yet still have substantial damage. Yes, I think he has many flaws which make him a bad pick in many situations if you are going alone, but paired with the proper support, there isn't that much to go around. I do agree a little more tankiness would be good, his base hp makes me mad, since i think it barely makes him have the same amount of \"health\" as other juggernauts when combined with MAX shield value, so a buff there would be good. Fixing Rylais to be more of a melee item would be good too.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Khâmul","date":"2017-04-26T18:19:23.245+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be honest, I'd like a full rework. There' 3 things defining Mordekaiser: Convert damages to shield, enslaving people for sexual purpose (occasionally for war) and a big mace.\nThe thing is,For some dude with a big armor,he isn't that durable  and for a melee without mobility, it's quite bad. I still don't understand why they removed his armor/mr buff from his W and still keep it for annie ...\nDarius is a really good rework since he doesn't hurt that much UNTIL he gets a kill with his ultimate:there he becomes a monster. Darius feels like a juggernaut, Mordekaiser do not. I still play him because well,it's an afinity,you don't need a champion to be OP to appreciate playing it. but here ,he is a pale copy of what he was and make him rely on other people...Mordekaiser relying on the power of friendship...there's a problem there.\n\nBut yeah,I agree with you,he should have more HP. A passive shouldn't be used to cripple someone .\n\nIllaoi and Darius have kits that allow them to do a lot of damages even if they don't build damages. In order to do damages,morde must build ap, so no tanky,so he dies,so no juggernaut.\nI'm not saying he isn't viable (because he is strong), but still,he has no identity","replies":[{"poster":"THUNDERMINE","date":"2017-10-22T06:27:50.187+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think he needs +10 movement speed and his q needs to have the mini maces that fly off and hit other players on the third hit as a dmg buff which adds a slow on the third hit and when he ults someone it automatically adds a 10% slow. ggwp","replies":[]},{"poster":"ObscureParticle","date":"2017-04-26T21:22:07.918+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well.. he does have an identity. How many melee mages casters are there in the game. Yes, you do have a few, but no one really that can go bot lane and still be viable. I think also the fact that he is based around shield and hp regeneration while doing significant damage has it's own identity. \"The power of friendship\", yes I get you there, it is pretty bad to be caught in the jg alone with no one to cast your W or to prevent the enemy from kiting you. But that doesn't mean it would need a full rework. May be a small slow on the E or changing the speed on W to be \"towards visible enemies\" would do it.  The problem with a rework is that he might be damaged even further than he already is...

What would be an identity for me would be \"a skishy melee mage with high damages\" or \"a tanky melee mage with sustained damages\"\nif you take first option,you die because you lack mobility and get ganked so easily(your entire kit is designed to push while trading). If you go tanky,you're worthless because all of your spells depends on ap.\nYou can find ways to play him,but I think he is failed in a design point of view","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"That1Llama","date":"2017-10-06T02:02:34.106+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly, I think Modekaiser should get a visual rework, A rework to his w (maybe make it some kind of dash but keep the aoe) his e can be a lot better if it had some kind of on hit effect such as a slow or lifesteal. He should keep his passive and his r. I just think he needs an engaging skill and on hit on his w as well as a visual rework.
