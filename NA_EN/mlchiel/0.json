My ticket sits there, open and unresolved and as far as I know unread, even.\nLast time when I sent a ticket to riot support it was answered in a day so I find this a bit strange.\nNow my request is a server transfer on my other account, which has been recently hacked and tranfered to Russia since it only cost 1 rp a couple of weeks ago.\nThis means I haven't been able to play for the past couple of weeks.\nIf any rioter happens to see this post and is willing to help me out, here is my ticket number: #32049849\n\nThank you.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-11T15:38:51.181+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't have a lot of visibility over EU support, but there might be some investigation time here as EUW support collaborates with Russian support to find out what happened.
