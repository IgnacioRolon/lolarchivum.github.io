After I click around a bit it will tell me that the client is not responding and will close down. What doesnt make the most sense is that I was just able to play a 1forall game earlier this weekend, but since yesterday have had no luck. This even happens now when i try to put just myself into a custom made game. Any suggestions???","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-30T04:45:49.369+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"These symptoms typically pop up if your connection to the gameservers is *pretty poor*.

Champs get selected and then client closes out to load the game, see league of legends logo then BAM, game closes out and bugsplat asks for a report.\n\nI've tried disabling firewall and anti virus and also allowing permissions through them. I changed the compatibility mode to Windows 7 and Vista and also tried running as admin. I flushed the DNS and did a few other things and made sure all my software is up to date and nada. Only thing I haven't tried doing is reinstalling so I can run the old client. I tried to run the beta client to help em out but I didn't expect it to stop me from playing completely. Hopefully reinstalling fixes it.\n\nEDIT: Running the game as the legacy client didn't fix it either. Fuck this game, I've already spent too much time trying to fix a game just for assholes to abuse me once I get into a game anyway.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fonomika","date":"2016-11-29T05:24:05.910+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Me too.
