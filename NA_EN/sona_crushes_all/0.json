This makes the text of your name look fuzzy and jittery.\r\n\r\nSince 2 days ago the problem seems to have become much worse, when i lock camera and issue movement commands the screen can judder sharply moving and snapping back into place briefly. This is quite uncomfortable visually too look at and makes the camera tracking really rough.\r\n\r\nI have a 144hz monitor with frame rate unlocked, i remember when i bought this for xmas, the motion was REALLLLY smooth when i locked down the camera. Now it basically vibrates, and the panning motion looks messy.\r\n\r\nIve tried v-sync enabled and disabled...changed res... same problems...\r\n\r\nAny ideas?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-05T16:11:41.359+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let's first make sure that your config isn't the culprit here, in case of some corruption.
