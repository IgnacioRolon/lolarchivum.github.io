Most people think that Garen is pretty much a joke or don't actually remember him at all and for a good reason. His lore is kind of lame and his kit is just too simple etc. I still like playing him thought but one thing just amazes me: his ult's cooldown! There are actually only 5 champions with longer cooldowns on rank 1 ultimate (karthus, shen, soraka, noct, tf) and all of these are global! To top this all off Garen's ult is a joke at rank 1; it deals almost no damage to even low targets. I really don't understand what's the point of having 2:40 cooldown on a execute skill. I doubt this post will have any impact because it's not on reddit frontpage but hey at least I tried.

Three if you think you can get away with it, which sometimes you very well may be able too. Even Hexdrinker can be a good buy, just last game I had to itemize specifically against auto attackers, and hexdrinker allowed me to get away with building full armor, even tho the enemy had a Katarina.\n\nBC is only good if you have muiltiple teamates who can benefit from it, or if your adc is actually carrying.

Also applies on-hit effects to minions and neutral monsters. This is a slight nerf to his early game damage output, but the scaling should be enough to improve his lategame. No longer slows Garen's movement through units when he is using ghost or phantom dancer.\n\nR: Range increased to 550 from 400 (I really don't wanna touch the early CD on this thing, it's always up when I need it during the laning phase, but requires suicide rushes to pull off during teamfights)","replies":[]},{"poster":"redniwediS","date":"2015-02-06T23:45:09.801+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Now that the abomination that was DFGaren is gone for good perhaps his ult can get a little tune up.
