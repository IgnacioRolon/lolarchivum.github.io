You guys said URF would be back this month, and you put it in Nexus Blitz!? And u think that will be ok? come on... \r\nEven so URF is the best mode in game, and the only reason people quit and come back to game JUST to play that, you guys add URF in game like... once a year for like, 3 days or something.\r\n\r\nSometimes the game get&#039;s boring, URF is the best mode to make people have fun in game again and change the boring pace of things in game.\r\n\r\nWE WANT URF!!!! BRING IT BACK PLEASE!!! (more often, for longest time!) {{sticker:sg-soraka}} {{sticker:sg-janna}} \r\nNo one cares about Nexus Blitz, and that&#039;s gonna be there for at least a month...\r\n\r\nPS: NOT ARURF, the REAL URF! {{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}}","replies":[]}
