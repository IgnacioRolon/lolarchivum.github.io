So, what happened? People wen't \"fk it, I want IP!\", and voted guilty ON EVERY SINGLE CASE, because there was statistically a higher chance of cases being punished than not. That lead to a metric sh\\*tton of punished people who had literally done nothing wrong, and forced Riot to shut its ~~nice~~ garbage system of handing out IP-for-\"justice\" down._\n\nNow, could you design the system in a way to prevent that? Yes, you could. With a huge pile of ressources, and constant supervising on the part of Riot invested into it. And at that point, the cost simply outweigh the basically non-existent benefit.\n\n---\n\nAlso, if new players want to learn the ropes, there are PETABYTE of instructional vids and written guides out there.","replies":[{"poster":"Z Statistic","date":"2016-12-01T21:44:04.676+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"If there is a case opposite of rose tinted glasses, this is one of them.\n\nRiot removed the IP reward because of an accuracy deficit.

But I'll do this for fun since I'm a stats guy.\n\nYou don't get to pick and choose statistics you like or dislike unless you have a methodological quality reason.\n\nThe fact of the matter is that Tribunal players were primarily motivated by goodwill. Of the minority that was motivated by IP, their accuracy was significantly lower. Was it skewed to Type I or Type II error? It doesn't say. It makes sense that people on the Forums would say 'spam punish' because of the self-selection of activeness, but what of the people who didn't post on the forums and were still in it for the IP? They may have a different distribution of error. This is something untestable except by Riot, however, so arguing this point in meaningless.\n\nAlso, youtube, reddit, gameplay, whatever. They're all self-selected samples, which means they are shit for representing the population. At best, they are simply some ideas of where to look for some opinion polling, but I'm pretty sure Riot knew that Dynamic queue was unpopular.\n\nBut anyway:\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/XvqbAgrF-letos-talk-about-dynamic-queues-and-ranked-play\n\n\n> When we polled a random set of players across all of League of Legends the specific question: “I like that you are allowed to queue with any number of people to play ranked”, about 55% of players agreed, 20% were neutral, and 25% disagreed. We’re not saying this to sway opinions either way--it tells us the system is both polarizing, and broadly desired. We’ll check in on this statistic again next week.\n\n\nNow move down to here: http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/competitive/riot-pls-ranked-pls-2017-season-ranked-changes\n> \n> Anyone who followed our ranked changes this year is now probably thinking \"so what changed?\" For months, we resisted calls to re-release Solo/Duo Queue alongside Dynamic Queue because we believed queue health for both queues would suffer. We also thought we could improve Dynamic Queue enough to satisfy those who feel left out by its design—specifically, those players who really hate playing against premades (or who think premades destroy the integrity of the ranked ladder).\n> But over the course of the 2016 season, we developed matchmaking and design improvements to Dynamic Queue that have increased our confidence in our ability to support two ranked queues. So now we want to try it out.\n> Ultimately, there are fundamental, irreconcilable differences between Flex and Solo/Duo Queue beyond their varying rules on premades. Our hope is both queues will thrive by leveraging those differences to attract different types of players.\n\nSo here is the picture that is being painted:\n\n1. More people enjoyed dynamic queue, but more people who dislike dynamic queue dislike it very strongly than people who like dynamic queue like it strongly\n2. There are regional differences in population of playerbase; the US is not how every region works and dynamic queue was designed to be a one-size fits all\n3. After a year of committing to dynamic queue only, Riot still couldn't make it accomplish the goals it set out despite numerous changes, and since it was polarizing they decided to cut their losses and revert back to Season 5.\n\nSignificant deviation from this explanation necessitates the claim that Riot is flat out lying. Do you have a third party source that did its own research and came to a different conclusion than Riot? Because if you don't, you are talking out of your ass.","replies":[{"poster":"Martensitic","date":"2016-12-02T18:41:30.365+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">that would be thrown out on face value in any journal\n\nPlease make me laugh more.\nBecause other than most people, I wrote scientific articles in my professional career when I was still in academia.

All queues need solo players to survive. It may work in some regions, but not others.** If that's the case, we'll turn the Flex Queue into a strict five-man queue, **effectively converting it into the old ranked fives queue (minus the roster management restrictions and plus all the algorithmic improvements we developed during the 2016 season). \"_\n\nSo basically, even they had to realize in the end, what an enormous FAILURE Dynamic queue was, and how universally HATED it is in the community.\n\n**And the first step has already arrived: Flex queue can no longer be accessed by parties of 4.

Yet, he kept on ranting on about some bullshit made up fact. And the say the tribunal was unfair? That's ridiculous. The tribunal was pretty much the most fair system we've ever had. To say it was unefficient is 100% true cause of how slowly Riot made it operate. But the amount of troll judges was insignificant in the amount of people who honestly wanted to make the game a better place.","replies":[{"poster":"Blue Collar Bear","date":"2016-12-02T19:59:19.734+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> He wants to be right.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Chimp Joker","date":"2016-12-02T19:54:53.180+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do like the idea behind it, but you can already do that by playing the game. Let's say you play a game of league, see someone on your team or the enemy's who carried hard and send request them. Ask the player if he/she can mentor you and help you. I mean, there are people on the board who have offered to teach/mentor another player. I don't see a need for Riot Games to use up time and resources to make a program that anyone can relatively already do.","replies":[{"poster":"Blue Collar Bear","date":"2016-12-02T19:58:39.135+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"New players often don't know where to look. The end game lobby isn't an effective place to seek mentoring. Ever get trashed, and you're immediately like, \"I gotta add that guy and ask for him to be my Master Roshi.\" It doesn't work at the level of play that new players are at.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Imperial Pandaa","date":"2016-12-02T14:17:11.524+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would like to do it, but asides from abuse by  some people, how would you balance it? This is also a reason some surfs exist. They make a new account to help level and teach a friend the game. Would the program be designated to a specific map?

Any player who has been punished by the automatic feedback system is automatically rejected from the program. Players sign up through a website, similar to how we gain access to PBE. Players are matched based on familiarity and skill level with MOBAs.","replies":[{"poster":"Imperial Pandaa","date":"2016-12-02T16:47:01.041+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So, we would be on another serve like how PBE is or just using that as a sign up example? Matching based on familiarity would be problematic I believe. For the same reason as people who smurf to bully newbies. Could make an account and slick the new to MOBA and then cause chaos that way. You wouldn't be able to just ban people like that due to some people adapting to games very easily and dominating quickly. The only way I can see something like this working is if you forced it to be either a bot game, or a custom (maybe sandbox when it comes out).","replies":[{"poster":"Blue Collar Bear","date":"2016-12-02T17:35:51.353+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's as an example.\n\nIt's possible you could aggressively whitelist players that would be acceptable mentors. People always bring me fresh out of the box players who have no idea what they're doing. If I'm busy, I introduce them to my group of friends (who are also coaches) and they always have someone to be a resource. I'm not sure why this would be that much harder.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
