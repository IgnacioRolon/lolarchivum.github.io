That game is amazing though, nice work.","replies":[{"poster":"Blue Collar Bear","date":"2015-07-16T19:32:20.252+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Perhaps he would, but Braum jungle is something I've done since season 4 with Feral Flare. He has a surprising amount of sustained damage output. I got 30 stacks pretty easily. It only took me about 14/15 minutes in, since we got both dragons. I was also able to solo anyone on their team at about 20m into the game, and I got at least two triple kills that I can remember.\n\nThis was also a 4v5.","replies":[{"poster":"GundayMonday","date":"2015-07-16T21:45:53.790+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Legit. How do you handle the early clear? Honestly curious, want to try this out. Wouldn't he be better as a cinderhulk jungler since his Q scales with HP?","replies":[{"poster":"Blue Collar Bear","date":"2015-07-17T03:06:19.777+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can run him 21/9 or 9/21 in the jungle. Both have their strong points. Personally, I take 9/21 with scaling armor / mr runes with the rest being full attack speed. The idea behind Braum jungle with Devourer is that he has a lot of on-hit magic damage, and you can easily stack that up to become a front line bruiser that sticks easily to targets. His passive has an insane amount of magic damage, and by the fourth stack with a Wit's End, you can legitimately be dealing true damage to a squishy with Sorc Boots. The reason why I take Devourer over Cinderhulk is because with Devourer, your damage is all about auto attacking and proccing your passive. With Cinderhulk, your damage becomes more about landing your skillshot that scales off maximum health and being present in fights (i.e. less up front, sustained damage).\n\nI personally forgo clearing early. I get my buffs or just my red, and I immediately head in for a gank. In that game, I went Krug - Red and then straight to mid for a summoner burn and kill. If you have to clear, take your E second. The damage reduction is no joke and with your passive, you really don't take as much damage as you'd think.\n\nFeel free to keep discussing! I love talking about off meta picks like this.","replies":[{"poster":"GundayMonday","date":"2015-07-17T13:43:22.709+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Makes sense. Will try it out tonight.
