Maybe  they could put different requirements depending on the Q (like D3 for Solo, Master+/Challenger for Flex), but if you didn't to want to run risks get to D3+ in Solo","replies":[{"poster":"Blue Collar Bear","date":"2016-11-21T16:03:53.665+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How'd you manage to insult me and still not answer my question?

Get a source next time.\n\nInsult you? How? If a player is not mechanically skilled enough he has no chance to make to CS given how former LCS and CS players + highly skilled SoloQ players will be in teams competing for the spot. And if you are good enough to get in CS you have no problem in ranking up till D3\nD3+ for Solo is surely going to be a requirement as it has been for ages, so if you want to get sure to be eligible being sure to be D3+ in Solo\nNo one knows yet if they will put some alternative eligibility requirement for Flex Q players, since Riot hasn't posted any official source\n\nDon't be an asshole, otherwise no one will answer you next time, scrub","replies":[{"poster":"Blue Collar Bear","date":"2016-11-21T16:15:01.652+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That response time, though.
