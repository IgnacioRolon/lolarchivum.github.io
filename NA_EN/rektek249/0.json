I have pretty much everything setup except the \"install\" button. I have no idea how to manually install a skin since everyone on internet says \"Step 1: Install skin installer ultimate\". The only guide I found was written in 2010 which doesn't work anymore. How can I do that ? Which folder is it in ? Thanks all.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-09T21:48:05.019+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can't really give any suggestions on how to manually alter the game files since there's a pretty decent chance that could end up breaking your copy of League somehow. Riot's official stance on custom skins sits in a firm \"use at your own risk\" state, and also keep in mind that Riot reserves the right to take action if you're using custom skins to unlock skins you should normally pay for. \n\nIn the long run, be careful about how you're modifying game files as it could break something if not done right, and there's a chance those files could be flagged by our anti-scripting system.","replies":[{"poster":"RekTek249","date":"2017-06-09T22:18:14.446+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm fine with the chances of it breaking the game. Note that I'm not using this to \"unlock what you should pay for\" but to \"unlock what you cant pay for\". Also, since it's only one side, you can't pay for client-side skins, so technically, it would be legit. Also, just knowing which files to change would be fine. Thanks for your answer.","replies":[]}]}]}
