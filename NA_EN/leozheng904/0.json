However, so does everyone else. This right only protects you from the governnment, which is restricted from passing laws that infringe on your right to free speech, assembly, and so on. It doesn't force other private entities, such as Riot Games, to provide you with a platform and compel everyone to listen to you. We all have the right not only to speak freely, but also to not listen if we so choose. When Riot restricts your chat privileges (not a right - a privilege), they are choosing not to listen to what you have to say, and choosing not to transmit it to other players. If a theater employee asks you to quiet down during a movie, or a friend tells you not to swear at their house, or a newspaper rejects your submission, they are not infringing on your right to free speech. They are exercising their own.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=leozheng904,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=x4qoWPm7,comment-id=,timestamp=2019-12-26T05:28:32.811+0000)\n>\n> I did not mean to insult the other player.\n\nEven if I believed you, you had to have known that it's an insulting term. And even if you _somehow_ didn't, you do now.","replies":[]},{"poster":"NF Remilia","date":"2019-12-26T07:45:46.589+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Theres a huge difference between hate speech and freedom of speech.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2019-12-26T07:27:01.702+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Dude, judging by your name you probably have an Asian background so you may not know it, but the n-word has a long history of slavery and hate and should not be used.","replies":[]}]}
