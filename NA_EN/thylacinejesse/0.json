I remember when she came out she&#039;d shout things like &quot;Burst!&quot; and &quot;Erupt!&quot; when she shot that chunk upwards out of the ground (also my personal favourite: &quot;Maybe you should go over there!&quot; \r\n\r\nI remember these quotes are what made it feel fun playing her. However, maybe late in the summer of 2016 I noticed those quotes disappeared. I was really sad to see them go. BUT this past week I noticed they made a return with the new patch update. \r\n\r\nRito... or anyone, is this intentional or have I just gone a year-ish without hearing them? I feel like they were disabled but idk. Did anyone else notice this?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Zimberfly","date":"2017-07-01T22:51:45.624+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi friends! As Krabohod mentioned, Taliyah's W voice lines simply unintentionally broke somewhere down the line, and I wasn't aware until there was a discussion on the boards. Remember that if you notice VO or SFX missing, keep reporting those bugs here on the boards and your boy Zimber will fix 'em right up for ya.\n\nAgreed that her W quotes are some of my favorite lines or hers, and it's a bummer they were gone as long as they were! For the next patch, I've fixed them on her Freljord skin as well, and I've also improved the way they fire off (as right now they emanate from the rock, and that's well...a bit weird).\n\nHappy Taliyah mains make a happy Zimberfly. Catch ya on the Rift!","replies":[]},{"poster":"PurpleKingCrazy","date":"2017-06-30T15:52:36.698+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh so there were Taliyah Quotes I've never seen before? Man, and to make her feel more interactive is just another part of how I love her.
