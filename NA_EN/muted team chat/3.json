Sometimes I need to go the other form and the extra 3 minute wait has me transforming at the 18 minute mark... feels terrible.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m playing him a lot right now but I&#039;m staring to catch on that he kinda sucks in the current meta. It&#039;s the same weak early game as yi but with less reliable hyperscaling.","replies":[]}
