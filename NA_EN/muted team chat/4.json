I was Udyr vs a jungle Leona. My team played terribly early: ignored Leona&#039;s telegraphed pathing and even the wards she was walking through, dying to her ganks repeatedly. However, as a duelist jungler I was able to take every crab  and invade her because the lane comps were favorable. Eventually I was taking all her camps and warding her jg freely because she couldn&#039;t really stop it. We won and it was boring.\n\n   The enemy team PLAYED BETTER but lost because we PICKED &quot;BETTER&quot; CHAMPS.\n\n   I play this game because I want to have the fun I used to have in previous seasons, but it just isn&#039;t happening. The time investment of learning how to play a new game is seeming less and less daunting.\n\nI miss karthus jungle, or fid jungle, or teemo jungle, or pre-rework GP jungle or Garen jungle... etc. I miss options. I don&#039;t like jungle to be defined as &quot;be at this point on the map by this time.&quot; This was the wrong way to shake things up and the outcome was PAINFULLY predictable.\n\nedit:\nTLDR for you mouth-breathers: my beef is with the pigeon-holing of the jungle in to crab-centric duelists rather than allowing there to be variety in jungle play-styles. Leona went gank-heavy SUCCESSFULLY, but that isn't viable any more.\n\nHere is a video that summarizes my feelings cause judging by the comments you all have reading-comprehension problems...\n\nhttps://youtu.be/fPLiXiJw0Xg\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"Snowplosion","date":"2018-05-23T03:54:06.327+0000","up_votes":61,"down_votes":3,"body":"you sure it was because you were a duelist jungler or was it because she was a fucking leona...","replies":[{"poster":"SSShutTheDuckUp","date":"2018-05-23T05:13:29.968+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":5,"body":"Kinda on point.

In any competent elo, Leona will never be a good jungler, no matter what changes they do to the jungle or her. Early game duelists will destroy her constantly.

Not lose because the other team just happened to have Udyr. She should have lost if she didn't play well.","replies":[{"poster":"Snowman Arc","date":"2018-05-24T15:47:01.891+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"She didn't play well enough. Her ganks worked because his allies were blind and because she has a lot of CC. That doesn't mean anything. I could play jungle Soraka and walk between lanes and heal up my laners so that they win their lanes. I did well, right? Oh wait, the enemy Graves farms 2 jungles now and has solo killed me 5 times, but hey, I'm supporting my lanes.\n\nIt's not black and white. Jungle, and any other role to be honest, covers a huge variety of things that need to be done. Just because Leona got off some ganks doesn't mean anything. She couldn't contest Udyr farming her jungle, which put her behind so much, that eventually Udyr took over. That doesn't mean that Udyr is strong, it means that Leona jungle isn't viable, because the basic thing of her role (contesting, farming and defending her jungle) can't be accomplished by herself.\n\nYou gotta realize that ganking as a jungler is a secondary option. Your main win condition as a jungler is to beat the enemy jungler. How? By keeping vision on the map (invading), by stealing their camps to set them behind and also trying to kill them as well. If you can't do those, that's when you resort to ganking. If 1v1ing the enemy jungler is risky, or your champ can't do it, that's when you focus more on ganking. That said, you still need to at least be able to have some farming power in the jungle. Amumu is weak in duels, but he can at least clear camps quite fast, and can gank well. Leona can't clear camps at all, which means that she can't invade the enemy and can't even 1v1 either.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"IcyPepper","date":"2018-05-23T04:37:41.311+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":3,"body":">My team played terribly early: ignored Leona's telegraphed pathing and even the wards she was walking through, dying to her ganks repeatedly.\n\nI mean sounds like the Leona wasn't doing half bad.

It&#x27;s been the case since Season 2.  You try to jungle, you have no clear, you suffer for it, even if your ganks are great.\n\nYeah, but before you at least had a choice in viable junglers - you could have a duelist, or you could also play non-duelists with great clear and ganks  (Once again - {{champion:20}} comes to mind.)\n\nNow, forget playing the solo clear gankers - the meta is comprised of duelists and tanks who can survive the duelists only.\n\nDo we really want to see {{champion:141}}{{champion:5}}  {{champion:59}} {{champion:104}} {{champion:11}} {{champion:102}} {{champion:164}} {{champion:107}} {{champion:106}} {{champion:72}}{{champion:154}}  duking it out for the next year to the exclusion of just about everybody else?\n\nIt's like the old toplane melee meta went to the jungle instead, and nobody wanted either change.","replies":[{"poster":"jadelink","date":"2018-05-25T17:02:43.594+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Most tank jgers (zac included) are weak at the moment.  But tanks in general are weak at the moment.  When was the last time we saw a Maokai or Naut in top lane ?  I cant remember seeing one for ages.  Sej is in a miserable spot too.\n\nI suspect tanks are weak in top and jg alike due to not actually being able to take the bruisers and skirmishers at the moment.  I've certainly had success on early junglers who don't want to duel.  Good pathing has me keep up with them fine.  Though Im not thrilled about jg being determined by mid lane quite so much, thats probably my jg bias.\n\nThe nature of the game being so snowbally is favouring assassins and skirmishers a lot at the moment, in both top lane and jg, and sadly I do expect that's going to be worse with the vast extra tank busting power they can access when the new items come to live.   Losing the ability to mitigate crit with Tabi and Randuins is going to mean teams of squishy fighters on both sides, which I don't like, as it tends to mean boring, one sided stomps, where even winning doesn't feel great, as it gets to be a forgone conclusion 12 minutes in.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Somebody Love Me","date":"2018-05-23T03:54:59.858+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":">    The enemy team PLAYED BETTER but lost because we PICKED &amp;quot;BETTER&amp;quot; CHAMPS.\n\n\nYup.
