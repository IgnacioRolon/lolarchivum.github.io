I have not played LoL since the end of July 2016, but lo and behold my account had some matches on it from the beginning of the September 2017.\r\n\r\nDo I have any options to get my account unbanned? While I have not played for over a year, I imagine I would play again at some point in the future, and I have invested money into the game for skins and the like, so it would irk me if I lost all my achievements in the game because someone did something malicious while I wasnt looking.\r\n\r\nThanks for any support or feedback you can give.","replies":[{"poster":"FNC kcal12","date":"2017-09-09T01:35:01.069+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Call this guy ------> he knows how to revenge-hack someone, heard he likes gorillas http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/navy-seal-copypasta {{champion:62}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"TC X0 Lt 0X","date":"2017-09-08T19:40:54.312+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cheers everyone, I got my account unsuspended.

If you weren't the one who played the games that got the account banned, we might still be able to help out. Reach out to our account agents in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and they should be able to start looking over everything after verifying you created the account.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chermorg","date":"2017-09-08T00:04:17.810+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I recommend submitting a support ticket. They have been known to (read: they might, but no guarantee) give a one time exception to the rule against never reversing bans if your account was punished for actions solely taken by a hacker.\n\nBefore they do that, you'll have to give them some information such as first champs/skins purchased, emails associated with the account, and lots of other information so they can be 100% certain you're the original owner.\n\nBest of luck to you!","replies":[]}]}
