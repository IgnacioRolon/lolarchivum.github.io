With fiddlesticks, throwing an e (Dark Wind) anyone hit doesn't take burn damage unless you auto attack.  Fear, drain, ult...none matter until you auto attack them once to reset the debuff.  I think it has something to do with their healing.  I've found they don't have to heal all the way back up either.  If they heal at all then it's like it turns liandry's off.  After testing this in several ARAMs with Kai'sa (w), Lissandra (q,w,e,r), Nasus (e), and Shaco (w,e), I've found it affects them too.\n\nAlso, after hitting one person (and they heal any) and you hit a different person, the burn doesn't go on the other person.  You HAVE to auto attack the champion to reset the burn.  You can't even auto attack a minion.  I've been testing it on most champs I've tried.  If they have an ap ratio, it affects them.  Auto attack based champs like Diana, Akali, etc. would still be affected, but they wouldn't feel the effects of it since they auto attack so often.\n\nAny ranged poke champions get kind of devastated.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GonahtanuGepardi","date":"2019-12-17T19:27:00.233+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"Liandry's is working as intended.

I know its 10s on the TFT items) then the burn will stop applying damage. Meaning, on people who dont constantly re-apply burn damage from the same spell (i.e., if you built it on Ryze) then it should work normally. But on someone who applies the debuff multiple times from the same spell (any DoT effect, or summon effect...Teemo, Fid, Zyra, Amumu, etc...) then the burn will stop applying from that spell after x time has passed, even though the spell should be reseting Liandri's on every tick of the DoT, or attack from the summon.\n\nThey can theoretically fix this in the same manner they did the TFT item bugs.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Trias000","date":"2019-12-17T16:57:29.419+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Bug Splat Report,realm=NA,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=o7ihPVQm,comment-id=,timestamp=2019-12-17T04:33:46.756+0000)\n>\n> 3, turn on w and burn the dummy (note 3 types damage tickers: 2 magic (blue) and 1 % of health (white))\n> 4, walk away and let the dummy heal with w still going\n> 5, walk back up to the dummy and let the w hit it again (% of health (white) damage is gone, dps is changed too)\n\n\nThe white number is true damage from Amumu's passive.

The confusion comes either from the Amumu passive, or a possible use of the \"Cheapshot\" under the domination tree (first row rune).

OP mentioned a few champs and some of them fit this bill (Shaco w,e; Liss q,w,e,r) but some don't (Nasus e; Kai'sa w). The screenshot of Ziggs shows true damage values of \"16\" and \"28\" which would be consistent with the 15-45 true damage range of \"Cheap Shot\"; this makes sense as Ziggs' e slows and would thus be able to proc \"Cheap Shot\". However, \"Cheap Shot\" has a 4 second cooldown which would mean some other form of true damage is responsible in addition to, or instead of \"Cheap Shot\".\n\nIn conclusion, Liandry's is working AS INTENDED.
