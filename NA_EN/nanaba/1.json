RIOT has been constantly pushing out new champions, skins, and visual updates rather than the much more important problem mechanics. We all love you RIOT&mdash; despite what many of our comrades have done and completely ditched the idea of playing league anymore after giving up on the idea that you&#039;ll ever fix your game&mdash; We have stayed. If you are a veteran like me then you have undoubtedly noticed that RIOT&#039;s focused has shifted from making a quality game and instead have tried to please the community with visuals. Luckily graphical updates are a good thing. That isn&#039;t the thing that worries me the most, it&#039;s the champions. Your graphic designers and artists can always work on skins and such in their spare time, but why are your programers (And whoever else is included in the champion balancing processes.) focused on new champions instead of the incredibly broken ones? I myself enjoy playing Poppy, but we can all tell she&#039;s broken as hell. When I look closer though it isn&#039;t that bad. She only really needs a few minor nerfs to make her balanced. She actually is quite underpowered in some cases. There is the problem, _&quot;minor changes!&quot;_. Why are you (RITO) putting so much time and energy into new champions? In the time it takes you to make a new champion you probably could have fixed several champions. This brings me to another point: Jhin. I give you my compliments RITO, Jhin is incredibly well balanced. He seems slightly weak but if played correctly he can be just as insane as a fed Draven. I think RITO has it&#039;s ups and downs, but they aren&#039;t gone or anything. Broken champs are not as broken as they may seem. Some champions may seem broken but maybe they are technically balanced according to the code. Some champions might not be broken but are simply too _easy_ to play. Here is my example for this: Master Yi. Master Yi isn&#039;t broken at all, he&#039;s actually quite balanced in my opinion. If Yi get&#039;s &uuml;ber-fed  then he will obviously seem quite broken because of how easy Yi is to play. From experience however, I can tell you that if you decimate a Yi in the early game you can prevent him from ever doing well. The thing is that later, he&#039;ll catch up and be more over-powered. This is because it just flat out isn&#039;t hard to play Yi. There are a few other characters like this (Darius, Mundo, and for whatever reason most agree that Zed can be one of these champs.) most of the champions that act like this are snowball champions. They can do well- or terrible. It&#039;s also based on team play. If a Poppy (I know all of this from shear experience) is quite fed, trying to 1v1 her will guarantee your death almost every time (Similar to Jax). If you work together with your team though you can catch Poppy and engage in a 1v5 situation, you will slaughter Poppy, she&#039;s incapable of 1v5ing. All it takes is some co-operation. That is a huge problem in a solo queue as you obviously lack good communication with your teammates. I think that at least half of the champions considered to be busted are simply looked at in the wrong situation. It&#039;s not that they&#039;re overpowered it&#039;s that you are engaging the champion in the wrong way. I hope that every summoner out there can take a page from my logic that RIOT probably notices the problem but doesn&#039;t actually think we are right in assuming a champion needs to be nerfed or buffed.\r\n {{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[]}
