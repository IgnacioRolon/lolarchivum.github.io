Over at [/r/QuinnMains](https://www.reddit.com/r/QuinnMains/) we&#039;ve been discussing her because of [RiotRepertoir stating that he&#039;s working on her](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/yE4n71RT-repertoir-or-meddler?comment=0001). Though RiotRepertoir has a good reputation we&#039;re still antsy, so we&#039;re trying to show Riot what we and everyone else like and dislike about her.\n\n**Quinn mains agree:**\n\n * Quinn is buggy and [needs bugfixes](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report/gR4xnthq-quinn-e-bug-fully-reproducable).\n\n * Quinn definitely needs to keep her passive, her E, and the transform on her R. Only QoL and number changes. We feel these are the core abilities of her kit and define her as Quinn, for better or worse.\n\n * We like Quinn for her identity as a duelist and roamer. We would like for her solo lane playstyle to be preserved.\n\n * Skystrike as it is needs some changes. Opinions on this vary from preferring minor to major changes, to outright removal and compensation. A large number of us would like an escape post-ult, and everyone would like a lower cd.\n\n * Quinn&#039;s W passive is really nice (though the timing between it and passive should be synced), yet the active is dull.\n\nHopefully with your help we can make sure that any Quinn changes are done well. We&#039;d also like to know some of your opinions on Quinn, playing with her, against her, etc. Since we are the ones playing Quinn, we can&#039;t provide that useful info for Riot.\n\nIf you want to read up on the discussions that came before this post, you can do so [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/QuinnMains/comments/3ktnrf/if_were_going_to_survive_any_quinn_changes_we/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/QuinnMains/comments/3l2eq4/our_unified_position_on_quinn_prt_2/), and a number of other posts in [/r/QuinnMains](https://www.reddit.com/r/QuinnMains/).

In her changes, we're trying to mostly preserve what is cool and fun about the character while hopefully making the whole package make a bit more sense, especially from a gameplay perspective.\n\nI will say that in the update, you can expect her abilities to mostly be the same, with changes here and there to their effects, cast types, numbers, etc.","replies":[{"poster":"TurquoiseYoshi","date":"2015-09-21T20:48:50.556+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"And there are bugfixes?

Now that she's being looked at, I'm worried that a surge in her popularity might make top lane a \"no-go\" zone for melees for a patch or two until she gets nerfed to the point she can't solo lane anymore.

I'll just respond to them in order:\n\n* **Bugs:** Quinn's blind (if it isn't removed) need to be WAY more consistent than it is now. The fact that it just doesn't work on some empowered autos (most notably Vayne's Q) but does work on some others... it baffles me. Her E is little less wonky, in that it messes up a lot less often. If you can easily fix those rare glitches, good; if not, don't sweat it.\n* **Core abilities:** Her passive is core to the theme of Quinn and Valor and to her \"windows of opportunity.\"\n* Her Vault is core to her flexible playstyle, and is just a good ability. There's a good decision point in it; Maybe you use it to chase, maybe to kite, maybe just for damage. Either way, it's a cool, unique ability, with a small window of counterplay, and it's a lot of fun.\n* Obviously, her transform Ult is very important. When she's done scouting and knows the coast is clear, she uses her Ult to go in for the kill. It's crucial to her identity that she can punish out of position enemies with her ult, whether that be with a quick burst to finish someone off, or with the sustained dueling power to keep that pesky Caitlyn from farming bot alone.\n* I would actually disagree with the OP and say that her W active is also important to her identity. She's a scout after all, she should have some vision. I like that I can quickly check if that pesky Caitlyn has a support hiding just out of view, before I fully commit. Or I can use it to keep vision as my target enters a bush. Or I can just make sure the entire enemy team isn't waiting to kill me in our jungle when I rotate. I suppose the ability is a little basic, and could be more interesting (especially for the opponent), but I wouldn't change it much.\n* And since I mentioned every other ability, I guess I'll say, yeah, her Q is probably the least interesting of her abilities. I think it's important for her dueling power, and without it, she would need something else to let her duel enemy ADCs (that pesky Caitlyn must die!). She also needs it to at least keep up with top-lane duelists like Irelia. So I dunno. It's not a very cool ability, but it defines a lot of her power and who she can or can't fight.\n* **Overall Identity:** I play her as an ADC, but I know a lot of people play her top. I think both of those roles should be supported, or people will be upset (see Morde rework). Unlike a lot of marksmen, Quinn is not a good teamfighter (although not useless in a teamfight). Rather, she is a good duelist or split-pusher. Her strategic strength is in her ability to skirmish/duel, make or follow up on picks, and move around the map quickly and safely (using her ult and W). In otherwords, I agree that she is and should stay a duelist/roamer. For me, one of the most important things about Quinn, is that I have the option to go really aggressive, but I can also play safe and kite like a normal ADC.\n* **Skystrike (Ult):** This a tricky subject. On the one hand I like being able to occasionally play as an assassin (especially if I have to teamfight, and there's no way I can match the sustained dps of the enemy Jinx; I'd rather sacrifice my life to dive and kill her.) On the other hand, assassin was not one of the roles I mentioned as core to her identity. What kind of scout dives head first into the enemy, acting like a kamikaze pilot? If Skystrike were removed, I would be sad that I can't one-shot a Vel'koz, but I would understand if it had to go to make room for the rest of her identity. And yeah, the cooldown is REALLY long. I'd rather Quinn's ult be short cooldown with a little less combat power, allowing her to move around more and always be able to make a play if the opportunity is there.\n* **Heightened Senses (W):** I don't really notice the passive much, but I know the speed helps a lot. It's invisible power. Maybe move the attack to only be on her ult (for dueling), and buff the MS a tiny bit? And like I said before, I think the active is really nice, for knowing when I can fight and when I need to flee, i.e. scouting.\n\nThis is all just my personal belief, but I hope it helps you identify what is really important to Quinn and what can be improved.\n{{champion:133}} Godspeed","replies":[{"poster":"Saixos","date":"2015-09-21T20:03:40.259+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just real quick to clarify some things, her W in some form is part of her identity, but not exactly as it is.

A large number of us would like an escape post-ult, and everyone would like a lower cd.\n\nI'd either like to see it removed or made more relevant than Jinx ult which has like half the CD, when you compare Jinx's execute ult damage to skystrike it's pitiful, or have lower CD, so I don't need to feel a need to build CDR every game <_<, {{item:3158}} have been become a near staple buy on her for me lately cause I can't stand how long the CD on it is (and for more Es).","replies":[{"poster":"Phanron","date":"2015-09-21T18:59:59.977+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Vault is both Quinns most defining ability but also the reason she has dificulites in botlane and teamfights.\nI made a comment about it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/QuinnMains/comments/3ktnrf/if_were_going_to_survive_any_quinn_changes_we/cv0z8w6).\n\nI think Skystrike was only added to her so that she looks cool when she enters the fight again.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ultîma","date":"2015-09-21T21:11:33.908+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"I know this is a Balance & Gameplay thread, but I thought I'd come in and share a few thoughts for how I wish Quinn would appear thematically as well as mechanically. \n\nCurrently Quinn has a very awkward, crouched posture and wields her crossbow like a pistol when idle, and a more commando-esque animation when she's on the run. Her suit has a lot of neat detail and touches that are completely missed by the player due to the fact that while Quinn looks like a regal scout, she doesn't really move the part. \n\nAnother thing that I feel is really awkward about Quinn is how her passive looks; Valor swoops in every once in a while to mark an enemy, and disappears until another mark is set. It would be so much better if Valor remained on the battlefield, circling above as a non-intractable object, only flying upward to reveal enemies in the area upon using W. Currently it's really a shame that one of the hallmark of Quinn's character - her bird - is only glimpsed at in her current format. Valor should constantly exist on the battlefield in one form or another. As an interesting bonus, it would be cool if leveling W gave Valor his own circle of vision as he circled-about overhead. \n\nAlso while I love how Quinn's ult works, it looks extremely strange that Quinn just vanishes to let Valor take the lead - and that he suddenly grows twice his size... If you look at some of the earlier [Quinn concept arts from IronStylus](https://twitter.com/moobeat/status/420128324363382784) Quinn wielded a sword. Wouldn't it be cooler if, when using her ultimate, Quinn ditched the small crossbow to head directly into the fight as this agile, dagger--wielding rogue? Her skills could function the same, but Quinn would now be actor and fully display her Demacian skill and training. I think this change would really solidify Quinn as this analog to playing a Rogue in LoL.","replies":[{"poster":"Saixos","date":"2015-09-21T21:18:58.905+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think you'd get along well with Eagleheart.\n\nThat being said I'd love it if Valor was permanently present in the battlefield, or just had random small flight animations above Quinn ever now and then. Or even better if her autoattacks would randomly have Valor attack the enemy instead of shooting with her crossbow. But unfortunately I doubt these changes would happen considering the scope of the update, I doubt they have an animator with bunches of spare time to put together this kinda stuff.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ßae","date":"2015-09-21T17:05:23.110+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"More upvotesssss {{champion:133}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"GastonBarnacles","date":"2015-09-23T15:07:08.177+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"THERE IS A PAGE FOR MAINS??
