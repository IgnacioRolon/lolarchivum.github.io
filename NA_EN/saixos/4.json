Before warding limits were a thing, the sightstone let you have 4 charges but you could only have 2 wards from it on the map at one time and when you upgraded it you could place 3 at one time with 5 charges. There was an incentive on top of the minor health boost. Supports almost always rushed ruby because you had the extra effect of placing 3 wards at 1 time without having to purchase them. It was a big spike in vision control. Now that the regular sightstone isn't limited more to the normal ward limit there is no reason to get the Ruby sightstone. \n\nRuby needs to be brought back in line with the vision shift that occurred.

This is the sole reason it  has to be geared towards vision only. \n\nRuby SS was a must buy for supports before because it allowed us to do our job at an extremely low cost. My team always knew what was coming because i would have at least 5 wards on the map at all time. Personally i liked being able to do this. I didn't have a problem with it and the only people who did weren't support mains, but peopel who weren't happy getting stuck playing support. Ruby SS let us ward out and save tons of the money that we didn't get. \n\nThere needs to be something that sets apart Ruby SS from normal SS. Personally I think it needs to have a Trinket-esque regen style where every 2 minutes you'd generate another ward.

Won't be up much, but relatively useful in lane in that one case you can't save your adc under normal circumstances. It's an emergency active when your usual kit just isn't enough that one time.

And hey, actually LOOK at the matches in the history. I have 5 (five) support games in the relevant history without sightstone (I figure a year ago is outside of relevant history, and also 4 of the 5 were 10 months ago)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Mast3rShake","date":"2015-08-15T22:26:54.813+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"You are:\n1-0 thresh (0/5/9)\n0-2 taric (1/6/2)\n0-1 annie (3/10/3)\n\nyou don't support, even when you are the support apparently","replies":[{"poster":"TotalJerk","date":"2015-08-15T23:34:20.712+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are actually a few high ranked supports that occasionally forgo sightstone in favor of just upgrading their trinket and buying wards.
