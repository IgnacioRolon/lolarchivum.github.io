Knowing how many of our reports are labeled as false would make a lot more people trust the system, and having the chat logs of the games where the report was deemed as accurate would help us identify attitudes the community dislikes even if we haven't been punished. It would also let us send messages to Riot Support with inaccurate accurate reports, to help them improve the system.\r\n\r\nIt would probably also make people less surprised about incoming punishments - if the monthly status card says that your account is in poor standings, then people can try to reform and better themselves without even needing to be punished. Likewise, if you've been punished recently and then the monthly status card says you're in good standing, you can feel good knowing that the system has recognized your reform.","replies":[{"poster":"Periscope","date":"2018-05-11T18:33:31.602+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":17,"body":"I'm locking this thread.

I like your idea above but your missing the most important variable \"Number of justified reports\".\n\nWhat if you reported 400 players and only 3 got punished, 387 of those reports ware justified but the reported players reformed their behavior after couple of warnings? Is  that not what we need?\n\nThe system learns from us, if most of the players think that \"ez\" is unsportsmanlike conduct and report them, the system should deem that phrase as  an offense. The accuracy should depend from constancy of reports for similar cases/offences .\n\nI'm really frustrated when I see people with your idea of how the \"tribunal\" is deciding on a false report: \nReported + Not Punished = False Report.\n\nIt was imagined like this I believe, I mean the ideal cycle of life for a case;\nReported + Not Punished = Reformed player.\n\nDon't get me wrong I am not saying the system is working, I hate Lyte for his \"5% only are toxic\" claim, the fuck is that.

Reporting people is a good thing, but people would feel angry when their reports don't result in punishment as often as they believe they should. This is one of the hardest things for me to remember because I think I feel like most people: I don't report for nothing and I expect a response. It doesn't always work out that way, however.\n\n* When you give people a thermometer for how close they are to punishment, it gives them a way to maximize their toxicity while remaining safe. That's not cool.\n\n* People are already unsurprised by punishments - they receive warnings in advance. That or they're super-toxic and they get what they deserve\n\n* As far as \"false reports\" tallies go, that's a highly grey area. A low-weight reporter might report you correctly, but not have much affect on your account. Conversely, the checking systems might nullify a report by a high-weight reporter. Both of those are \"false\", but mean vastly different things.
