I say this, given that in my few ranked games this season, I am 6-0 on Sivir, with close to a 5.0 KDA.

That would empower her abilities in different ways. One boomerang gives her Q a minor slow and her W one extra or empowered attack. Another lengthens the range of Q and makes her E last 1s longer (although her spell shield doesn't really correlate with her boomerang, let's assume it's a magical one). Another gives her a MS bonus when her Q is out (think Ahri) and a minor slow on her W. Maybe one boomerang empowers her W to do extra damage on structures (towers, etc.). Some simple ideas. \n\nI love the physics of flying objects and boomerangs are some of the coolest flying objects. Design is EVERYTHING in how a boomerang flies, so if she chose between different boomerangs to use per game it could fit quite well.\n\nAdditionally, this gives her great strategic advantage in playing into different matchups. Against a poke comp she may go for longer range to combat that. Against a hi CC comp she may go for longer E duration or maybe it's a reduced CD. \n\nGive her more versatility in her utility.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nahui","date":"2016-02-04T15:12:43.080+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":4,"body":"The issue is her ult is so retardedly good that riot wants that to be the reason you play.
