The game would run at 37ping and would randomly jump to high 300s. Like I said I've only been having this problem since patch 7.4. My ping was perfectly fine during patch 7.3. I'm not sure what the issue is. I've tried everything that was suggested by the tech support and still haven't fixed the issue. I've re-installed my wireless driver, re-installed league, checked if my anti-virus was somehow interfering with League, re-started/refreshed my modem, tried DNS Flushing and changed my DNS Server IP address. These ping issues only seem to be affecting league since my ping is fine for the other games I play (i.e. CS:GO, TF2, etc.)","replies":[{"poster":"Citizen Cain","date":"2017-03-12T23:42:11.951+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Me and my gf have been experiencing the same issues lately, I have no idea how to fix it or whats causing it but I haven't had any trouble in For Honor (aside from their network issues lol)","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-03-13T20:56:53.032+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you both are getting high ping spikes when playing together, but not when you're playing other games, it could be a sign that your ISP is sending your connection through a less than optimal route.
