We're all connected to the same router, speedtests all OK. 3ms with 70Mbit download speed so that's fine.\r\n\r\nWhen we are all online in LoL the following scenario is there:\r\n- not all people show as 'online' , this differs per PC and person\r\n- if 1 of us invites the others, some get the invite after 2 mins or not at all\r\n- when we are in the lobby as 5 eventually, some people see only 3 in the lobby\r\n- when the host queues, not all people are in queue\r\n- when we get a game, some of us can see someone has to ban, but for some people the person who has to ban has 0 seconds remaining forever\r\n\r\nThis has been going on all day. Any ideas?\r\n\r\nWe already tried rebooting all PC's and resetting modem and switch, doesn't seem to help","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-16T03:16:16.815+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This may have something to do with your router not being able to handle that much traffic all at once. While the speedtest can turn out just fine, once you all start trying to connect the router has a _much_ heavier load to work with so it starts to have some issues connecting everyone together. The fact that you sometimes can't see any champions to ban backs this up, since that is happening because your client isn't able to get the champion pool data from our servers.\n\nYou could try using ethernet cables as opposed to wifi and that may be able to help some. Overall though, that router is probably having a hard time with that many connections at once.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Action Hank","date":"2017-04-15T15:12:46.364+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Additionally; playing CSGO is going without problems, we can all play at normal latency and no connection issues. I guess there is something wrong with the LoL (EUW) servers. It's near impossible to play a game with my friends at the moment.\n\nIs Riot looking into this?","replies":[]}]}
