Because that's literally the only prerequisite to a review and a punishment. If you didn't report him, it's your fault he \"got away\".\n\n> but him getting away with it seems like somebody didnt do the tribunal system justice.\n\nThe Tribunal's been dead for years. The current punishment system is the IFS (Instant Feedback System), an automated system that reviews reported players' matches and decides if it warrants a punishment. Which, as mentioned - the only prerequisite to a player's chat being reviewed and potentially punished is that you report them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2018-01-08T01:06:39.575+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"everything umbral said, also you have no idea if he got punished or not.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Modi","date":"2018-01-07T21:28:35.757+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":">  quietly playing the game?\n\n> responding to insults \n\nThose two are mutually exclusive.
