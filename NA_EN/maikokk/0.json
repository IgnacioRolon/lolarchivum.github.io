However, it's very faint compared to other ability audios, and the nature of the sound, means it doesn't stand out very much. I have the same issue of properly reacting to whether or not I've procced it, and it often ends up with me not utilizing the effect properly which causes me to lose a trade or even dying if i was too reliant on it. I use it on Riven to trade against slow-reliant champions who use their slows to force a longer trade or chase you down(Darius, Tryndamere, Olaf, etc.), and not timing the Stromraider's Proc properly, means I'll either disengage before proccing it, thus losing the trade because I can't get away, or stay in the trade during some of the duration of the effect making it time out before I can run far enough away. This problem comes solely out of not knowing whether or not the effect has procced or not.
