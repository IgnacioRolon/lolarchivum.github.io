If I restart the installation, I keep having the same issue, where the installation gets stuck and then freezes the whole computer. The specifications are all up to scratch so please could someone provide me with a solution or some form of information.\r\n\r\nThank you very much!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-03T16:30:03.632+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Getting stuck at this phase of the installation can indicate an issue with your connection reaching the patching server.
