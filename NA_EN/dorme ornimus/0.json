flames back in a passive aggressive way simply to try to piss him off.\n\n\nGame 2 you were just straight up flaming Galio, like he was 0/3, he knows he was doing poorly, you don’t need to telling him

then why not just mute him and play then instead of wasting time flaming him cutting down your chance of winning?\n\nDo remember that flaming doesn’t just hurt you, or your opponent, it hurts your whole team including the other three trying to win:\n\n> And another great example why riot needs to give context on this backlogs, it doesn&#x27;t really help a lot to se if it was a proper

experience in the game, since i was retaliating most of the time\n\nTwo wrongs don’t make a right and just like real life if you get in a fight with someone, both of you are getting in trouble.\n\n>nevertheless i was somewhat of annoying and i understand that but, if this system is based on an AI looking for words, and sintaxis we&#x27;re on a really bad shit.\n\nThis is just false or at least partly false, the game will punish you for bad words but only if what you say is really really bad, like only if what you say is homophobic or racist.\n\nThe reason you got a punishment is because you display a pattern of this kind of behavior and the last set of reports was the straw that broke the camel’s back to get you punished.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"HalcyonDweller","date":"2018-05-24T22:32:41.305+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Main thing I see here is that you repeatedly berated a teammate who

Context doesn't matter to Riot, at least for now.\n\nOne other thing to consider is that a teammate who is flaming you is doing it because they want a response or acknowledgement from you, if you can stand it without replying or if you can mute them then they will give up on it eventually because they will realize that it's not going to work. Alternatively when you respond you're kind of feeding the behavior.
