I sometimes also get error messages about my network connections even though it's fine.\n\n\n\nWhen the game does load it is almost impossible to play because of how much it laggs and freezes. \n\nI updated my graphics cards, drivers and lol to try and fix the problem. It had been playing fine for months but all of a sudden this has happened. \n\nSomeone please help xD","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-29T22:41:58.062+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds to me like your network is just having a *really* hard time connecting to the game servers after the match actually starts. There might be something blocking your connection somewhat, so make sure you have firewalls either disabled or have exceptions for League setup. Also, go through our [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) for the steps on Port Forwarding and DNS settings, as those have good luck getting players a smoother link with us.","replies":[]}]}
