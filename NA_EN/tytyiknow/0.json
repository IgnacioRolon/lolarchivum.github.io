Once this happens, my whole computer locks up and alt+tabbing or accessing the task manager takes about 2-5 minutes. I love this game and I'm trying everything I can to make this playable again.\r\n\r\nI've cleaned out my computer physically and on the software side using numerous virus scan tools, cleaned up the registry and even run chkdsk to see if it's harddrive failure. No problems were found with my harddisk.\r\n\r\nI'm also monitoring my heat and everything seems to be pretty normal so my mind is boggled. Needless to say, I have to restart my computer to get everything running smoothly again as it affects my ability to just navigate through regular internet browsing tasks. \r\n\r\nMy specs:\r\nSony Vaio Laptop vpcf1290x\r\ngeforce 340 1g video card\r\nIntel Core i7 q740 \r\n6gb ram\r\n\r\nI've just done a fresh install of LOL just to ensure cleanliness.\r\n\r\nOne thing I've noticed is that if LOL is the only thing I have open, my memory usage is extremely high at about 5.6gigs of usage according to the performance chart in Task Manager. Please Help me, I'll drive over to your headquarters to troubleshoot, it'll be my pleasure. I live very close to you guys. \r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nA loyal and dedicated summoner.","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2014-02-06T07:16:00.726+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey TYTYIKNOW!\n\nI do not believe you need to drive over to our headquarters for us to resolve this issue ;)  Fortunately, there are several different steps that we can take, which can resolve issues such as these.\n\nFirst, make sure that you visit the following Knowledge Base Article if you havent already, which includes many common solutions to resolve FPS issues with League of Legends:\n\nhttps://support.leagueoflegends.com/entries/21695399\n\nIf you have completed all of these steps, and if you are still experiencing issues with your FPS, then please do not hesitate to let us know here in Player Support by submitting a new [Support Ticket](https://support.leagueoflegends.com/anonymous_requests/new) and make sure to include the latest hardware information for your computer:\n\n1) Dxdiag information: http://support.leagueoflegends.com/entries/20100477-obtaining-a-direct-x-diagnostic-or-dxdiag\n\n2) Please send your most recent r3d log where you experienced the problem (You'll notice that the file name starts with the date/time and ends with r3dlog.txt): https://support.leagueoflegends.com/entries/22128450-League-of-Legends-Logs\n\n3) Process List: http://support.leagueoflegends.com/entries/20132988-obtaining-a-process-list","replies":[]}]}
