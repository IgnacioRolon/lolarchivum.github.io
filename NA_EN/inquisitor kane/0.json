Am I going to get noticed by LeaverBuster and lose LP?\r\n\r\nThat would be a bummer and discourage me from trying rankeds in alpha. I don&#039;t mind losing 5 LP for crash if it helps testing and improving the client, but I never rage quit games and don&#039;t need any trouble with LeaverBuster.","replies":[{"poster":"FrodoBagginses","date":"2016-08-05T21:46:17.317+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The legacy client has crashed on me more times than the alpha.
