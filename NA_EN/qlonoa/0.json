One day I opened the app and this error showed up. I noticed that if I didn't update the client, it would work so I started using the Legacy client. Today, May 3rd, the legacy client isn't available anymore and so I had to update to the new one and this error showed up once again. I've tried everything in order to solve this... I've reinstalled, I've used the repair tool, I've disabled the Firewall, I can't seem to figure out what is wrong. However, I noticed that the LeagueClient doesn't show the League icon. \r\nPlease help me solving this.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-03T21:16:28.656+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This might be a combination of old game files that didn't properly update during your transition to the updated client, and security settings blocking you from accessing files.  A reinstall and adjusting firewall settings are solid steps, so far.  I also suggest going over each step of the [permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) guide to make sure that the updated client and game files are added as an exception.  Let me know how that works out for you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Red Brambleback","date":"2017-05-03T15:25:41.604+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My friend have this problem too.
