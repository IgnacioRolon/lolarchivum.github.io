Often times its one of the higher stressed lanes simply because \n\nA) your most likely to have a 4-5 man gank before minute 10.\n\nB) if you die once or twice, there is always someone there who is like \"wtf, why did you do that?\" \"Report this adc/support\" etc.\n\nC) you have to actually find some kind of common ground between eachother's aggressiveness levels, and you need to know 2x as many champion strengths and weaknesses just for early game.\n\nD) it is a highly pressured part of the map. The only lane that sees ANY kind of similarity is mid lane. This is only because it is fairly close to Dragon pit as well, and its an easy roam for supports to go mid.\n\nThis is just part of the issues with your mentality there.\n\nThere is no \"easiest role\". If you are new to that role you will get stomped by a main of that role 9 times out of 10. Thats because they have the knowledge of that role and the various strengths and weaknesses of that role.\n\nThere also is no \"circle jerking\". There is people telling you things that you obviously overlooked. So get over yourself with your highly held self opinion.\n\nI repeat. There is no \"easiest role\". There may be an easier for you...... but there is no blanket easiest role.","replies":[{"poster":"Fowus","date":"2017-09-18T22:08:30.862+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"still the easiest role even with bad adc if u have someone who is average its easy","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"sobi999","date":"2017-09-18T14:37:26.726+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"in lane support role is hard af, outside lane and in team fights maybe you're right.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"PePsiLemoNN","date":"2017-09-18T15:55:28.341+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Is anybody even taking nb3 seriously anymore? lul","replies":[]},{"poster":"KoKoboto","date":"2017-09-18T15:24:33.336+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wait explain to me how this strat works?\nCarry + Support top lane\nMid lane (maybe a roamer w/ waveclear or good CC)\nCarry + Support bot lane?\n\nThat actually sound pretty interesting. Perhaps you take smite one one of them as well to occassionally clear camps.\n\nFor example, if you run a high peel support like Janna / Braum / Alistar or whatever than the carry can run smite and clear camps after clearing a wave or something with the support.\n\nIn past seasons the strategy is definitely not viable but now with the strength of hyper carries w/ ardent, coin, shields, heals, I see it being plausible with proper execution.\n\nI gotta try this out.

If jungle goes bot, you take a free first tower.\n\nSona top (for the 2v1 pressure), Taric bot might be most optimal. Not sure about ADC priority though. I imagine ones like Lucian or Vayne would be better, due to self-peel. Tahm's probably what you want if you're going to run immobile champs w/ waveclear.\n\nLulu+Kog is always good too, and obviously Trist.\n\n__________\n\nA big part of the concept is that not having a jungler actually sets the enemy jungler behind, due to how catch-up exp works. Even if they farm both jungles. \n\nThe lack of jungle pressure is compensated by the fact that if bot gets ganked, top just dives and takes a free tower.\n\nLack of smite isn't generally an issue because nobody does objectives unless the jungler is dead anyway at high MMR. \n\nIf you have to teamfight over an objective, your team has the advantage due to two marksmen/supports.
