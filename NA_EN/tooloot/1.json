I'm not complaining I love free stuff (I also understand the marketing and the money behind this) but players getting S+ on the losing team and not getting a single key fragment sucks. \nI'm not asking for us to easily get fragments but considering that you need 3 to get a single key and that chest drops are pretty rare, I think we should be rewarded when we have a great performance.\n\nIt's not every day you get S+ playing support on the losing team.\nIt's not a bragging thread BTW I can't really brag I'm only a silverino but I'm using my performance as an example.\nWhat do you guys think?","replies":[{"poster":"Melinda May","date":"2016-04-06T14:38:01.714+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its simple, keys are so fucking rare cuz Rito want you to buy them in the store.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Live2LetDie","date":"2016-04-06T14:29:06.026+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Working like they are suppose to.

You maybe should be able to produce a full key in a month. I would say maybe even 1 key frag a month.

Riot basically copied CS go and improved on the case key system by giving a possibility of free skins. Riot is rich becuase it sells skins. CS go at least you have to buy the game.

Asking for more key fragments is logical (even more when it's for rewarding great performances) . As I said they are already making big bucks with hextech crafting. Rewarding people for playing great might actually make certain players take the game more seriously.\n\nOh and just to be sure, were talking about KEY FRAGMENTS as in you need THREE of em to make a single key which might not open any chest in a month or so because they barely drop. People would still buy chests with RPs.","replies":[{"poster":"Live2LetDie","date":"2016-04-06T19:14:06.316+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ToolooT,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=sfsBgOXQ,comment-id=000000000001000000000000,timestamp=2016-04-06T18:54:21.957+0000)\n>\n> I bought a bunch of skins AND chests/keys with RPs.

It's basically just an add on to reward players for doing what they are going to do anyways. \n\nI was playing league before and now I get free stuff every year for doing.

However, the drop rate also rises along with the chest refresh.
