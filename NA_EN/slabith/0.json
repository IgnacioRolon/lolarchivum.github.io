Things dont become FoTM unless they're the least counterable things out there. Not that they dont have counters, but theyre the least counterable.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Who is Taliyah","date":"2017-01-04T06:59:35.089+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just Play \"shit tier\" Champs.","replies":[]},{"poster":"tyt921","date":"2017-01-04T17:20:18.570+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just learn to get better. If you and your enemy is same level, same skilled, if hes got FOTM then maybe he will have the edge. But if your skill level cap is higher than his, and youre more skilled, you should be able to take him down even with his FOTM. Sure there are OP champs, but if you play safe and use teamwork, like jungler ganks to help you give pressure. It will help ALOT. I been winning almost all my mid match ups. TBH, I dont think FOTM is factored in too much. CC's always counter OP/FOTM champs. In fact CC's win games.\n\nFor an example I cant believe I did, but I had the most difficult time against a ziggs last week. It was miserable. But Ziggs is not a FOTM, and typically hes easy to lane against if you dodge his bombs. I did for the most part, but the jungler kept ganking mmid and his damage was crazy after he built lich bane + his passive proc.....anyway\n\nMy top favorite mids right now are Ori and Syndra. Easy to play, and the burst is real lol. BUt there are other ones that are really good too like LB, Kat, or like a Viktor.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Attticus Finch","date":"2017-01-04T16:32:29.541+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because League has always been in a broken state.\n\nNostalgia and rose-tinted glasses are the only reason people believe in a time where there wasn't a meta of overbearingly strong picks standing out above the sea of chaff champs.","replies":[]},{"poster":"IA9hRfpP5q","date":"2017-01-04T16:31:08.263+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:164}} I heard someone call me... oh you said Broken.
