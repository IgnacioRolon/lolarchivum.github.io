His thematic and idea of a Marksman worked, Graves had a mismatch of thematics because he played with a shotgun and he performed like every ranged Marksman, shooting one measly pea out of his massive gun. Putting a real shotgun in his hands was the right course of action but i believe that he needs more mechanic changes in order to play on that aspect of his kit a lot more.\n\nJhin had a whole mechanic invented for him in order to work as a 4-shot Marksman. Graves needs more because he plays with 2, very short range cartridges that get stopped by minions, structures or terrain. He just isn't reliable as everyone else and he has no upper hand by having a bit more relative power of a true Marksman on very short leash. He isn't even a tank/bruiser busting Marksman and this role could potentially suit him currently.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DestructoDave","date":"2018-04-25T08:47:52.719+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Just ChiII,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=zYzl5hTM,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2018-04-25T08:16:12.193+0000)\n>\n> Dude graves got released so much earlier before.. &quot;Lucian Clone&quot; get outta ere you have no clue what you&#x27;re talking about.\n\nI know he did.

Old graves was just a Lucian Clone.\n\nExactly.\nI don't even know why people want his identity mixed again.\n\nI love the new Graves but i have to admit that he still has problems.\nHis Marksmen qualities do work but given how strong ranged Marksmen really are, he can't play their game because of how he was made to not have immediate damage upfront. He literally has to melee most of the times and his Q isn't a good damage dealer if people don't stay in the area or it explodes on contact with the terrain.\n\nHe works even better if he can melee shotgun someone in the face but that's a hard-pressed issue as Graves doesn't have stickability to his target. And what's worse is that he's in the same area as Urgot - considered as a ranged champion, played really close to a melee fighter instead. He needs survivability if he is to perform better in his role and his only option is upfront damage without the same safety net his ranged peers have. He is not even in the assassin territory anymore due to Duskblade and Lethality receiving nerfs quite a while ago.\n\nI don't know.\nEither his kit would need changes again in order to compete or he needs a classification of a melee champion. He needs access to bruiser items in order to perform in the role he's been given. I personally wouldn't mind him receiving changes again to play up on his shotgun mechanic a little bit more but i think that either option would do him a lot of good.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SîlentStorm","date":"2018-04-25T18:40:38.821+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOhoeIwLrMI I feel your pain","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mandalorian 117","date":"2018-04-25T21:26:57.573+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really like what they did with graves despite not playing him.
