Then when i hover over the grayed out play button it says that i've been banned and to relog to see my ban duration and reform card. So i do that but it just tells me the same thing that i have a chat restriction and the mini series. There is no notification of a ban. I have also checked the email associated with my acc and theres no email from riot at all about anything. Idk if this is a bug or what but i would like to resolve this ASAP. Below im going to link the pictures of what i am talking about.\r\n\r\nhttps://imgur.com/a/J4QdG\r\n\r\nhttps://imgur.com/a/kvx3P\r\n\r\nhttps://imgur.com/a/9kOB6","replies":[{"poster":"Hi Its Vari","date":"2017-10-03T04:11:19.208+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"soo how long does this process usually take because im sitting at 2 days of waiting so far and it would have been much easier and faster to have it dealt with by a rioter on here. I'm not sure why but every time i've ever had to deal with submitting a ticket to riot it always seems like it takes forever to get things going.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-02T04:37:53.528+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So from what I can tell on my end with the tools I have, it looks like this account was in fact dinged for toxic language which got you hit with the chat suspension, but that the system also has a ban in place. I am seeing reasons for both of those being there, but they definitely shouldn't both be active *at the same time*. \n\nGo ahead and hit us up in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) so that we can go over exactly what happened one on one with you.","replies":[]}]}
