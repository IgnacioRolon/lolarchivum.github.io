And now when I tried to log into the game it took quite some time (atleast 5-6 tries). Anyway when I finally get into the client i try to start my ranked games, i get into a que, but then it says can't connect to the client or w/e. So now I'm on my 8th time trying to log in. Finally I get into a ranked game! So I'm in champselect and i do my bans and picks. And when the game should start it says i can't connect and i have no internet (I skyped during this time so I had internet at all time). So I restart the client and try to log in. Wont let me. Second try... Wont let me. Third and final i get leaverbuster and 5 lowerque games. I'm quite certain that it wasnt my fault that i could not go into the game. So I'm asking if you could remove the lowerque time. And if not I'm sure you have your reasons. Anyway love the game and where it is heading!\r\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-01T22:49:29.728+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately, we are unable to modify or remove any sort of Leaverbuster penalties.
