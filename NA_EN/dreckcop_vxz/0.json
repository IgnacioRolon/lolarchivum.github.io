That is why it kept snowballing into overreacting because riot NA (or anywhere else aside from that one person) tried to be cute about it and not give any real info.\n\nThis is why it happens time and time again the past year, because Riot seems to feel we prefer them to be sneaky and cutesy with no info instead of just telling us like it is :P (I know that was all long-winded, sorry).","replies":[]}]}]}
