I mean skins you just give Riot money and they give you premium content but to go as far as having to travel to get something like a ward skin just seems a bit excessive.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-07-05T19:29:24.185+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not necessarily - it's not only events.
