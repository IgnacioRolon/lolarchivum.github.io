I have 8GB RAM and i7 core, surely this coupled with a 2GB card would be enough to run 120FPS on max graphics instead of 17-25FPS. I turn the settings down to min and its still only hitting 90-100 FPS. Before anyone suggests driver update etc I've done all that including deleting and reinstalling fresh drivers, downloading AMD catalyst controller and changing power play options/switchable graphics options to maximise performance. Has anyone encountered this issue? If so I would really appreciate some help!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-20T20:38:15.470+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds to me like your laptop might have a power setting that's not providing enough power to get the ball rolling.
