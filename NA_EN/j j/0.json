It gives champions that were unviable (mostly melee tanks or bruisers, or squishy assassins) to actually partake in initiation or getting a chance to be apart of the game. The spell has good counter play because of how slow it travels. So, people who get stuck with rammus, volibear, singed after feel relevant and even udyr. The problem I experience time and time again is the enemies would always have vast amounts of cc such as slows, roots, stuns. etc. which made initiating impossible and completely ruined the opportunity for those champions to be viable in the gamemode. I normally am against mobility but everyone knows that feeling of getting udyr and face palming because you knew you were 90% of the time useless to your team. It&#039;s also good for champions that already did fine with flash but relied heavily on flash so were truly useful only 4 times a match. (5 mins per flash ish avg game 20 mins)\r\n\r\nMy only complaint on mark is the cool down is ridiculously low. Mark serves as an offensive summoner ability that should probably land in the 45 second to 1 min cool down area. The enemy should not be bombarded by mark endlessly. It should not be a skill you throw around hoping to hit somebody just so you go in. It should be planned and executed as if you were using a longer cool down summoner spell. Mark is valuable for initiation, assassinating, and all over just catching up to an enemy. It should be used in it&#039;s most valuable uses. Not tossed around because the cool down is low. That&#039;s my only problem. Usually I am really upset with changes riot implements but this is actually something that was much needed and healthy for aram. Really impressed now please nerf the damage a bit and increase the cool down.","replies":[{"poster":"junglerboy16","date":"2015-04-29T16:51:11.621+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I 100% agree about the cooldown. I'm all for making melee champs able to stand toe-to-toe with ranged poke champs, but they've basically ruined ARAM's tension and moments of intenseity, because everyone is constantly hucking snowballs at each other and it is now even *more* about how fast you can dodge a skill shot. If they made it work like this: \"45 second cooldown, reduced by 30 seconds if you both hit and dash to a mark.\" then it would be much better, but right now, it is far too spammy and thoughtless and took away a lot of what made real ARAM fun.","replies":[{"poster":"j j","date":"2015-04-29T16:53:59.975+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wouldn't even want the CD reduced after landing it and dashing.

I understand the want to make certain champions actually viable in ARAM, but this ability isn't the way to do it. I feel like many champions are balanced around not having an instant gap closer, so giving them one that can be used in tandem with Flash is just stupid. It also seems to have a pretty damn short cooldown considering what it is, so I feel this ability seriously needs to be reworked already. Honestly I never felt like I was worthless in ARAM with any champion, be it Rammus or Garen or Volibear because all of these champions have some means of gap close even if its just a ms increase.","replies":[{"poster":"j j","date":"2015-04-29T19:17:20.617+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Shameless copy of my reply to someone else :\n\n\nFirst of all galio's ult is counterable via items and via dodging the snowball as well as champion abilities. Secondly I stated it would be good for champions who relied on flash but only could utilize flash an X amount of times per game. Giving the snowball a longer cool down would give people wiggle room to actually dodge them. Nobody said galio was not viable. The reason mark is good for aram is because it gives teams with awful rolls opportunities to make plays hence the champions I listed.\n\nGalio and alistar did fine without it and could do even better with them this is a very small downside in light of making teams with crap rolls actually viable. Aram games that are one sided due to another team being heavy melee or getting that udyr is now not going to be so one sided. Also you're just crying random crap to say it now. You can pefectly cs even with the snowballs especially if the cooldown is increased. Seriously don't be so dramatic. The mark is not in a perfect spot to which I already admitted despite it being very healthy for aram.\n\nMark + kennen is also strong but it's only as strong as the enemy makes it by allowing the mark to hit them. With a short cooldown the chance of it hitting is going to be more than if the cooldown was longer. I'm willing to sacrifice giving kennens or galio a slight advantage in light of also giving a vast majority of unconventional champions an advantage in aram as well. I personally believe this is a better advantage in favor of melees more so than it is for kennen + galio or even alistar.\n\nReally think about how toxic the concept was of rolling the champions I listed. In very few games ever did they shine in aram because they were limited to being sieged or cc'd non stop thus preventing them from retaining anything useful for an entire game. That's seriously toxic as hell for a gamemode. It promoted a significant problem that needed to be addressed. Mark completely alleviates the pain and visions of regret people had when entering an aram match and getting a champion which would be considered awful. I seriously cannot think of many backfires of implementing this summoner ability to aram. And as I previously mentioned I normally am extremely salty with increased mobility or anything riot does.\n\nI played a game on rammus earlier in aram with mark and my god was it a so much better experience. I highly doubt the galio, kennen thing would make or break a game because again this comes down to the skill of the team facing such a composition but also the skill of the player using that champion. This is \"aram\" not everyone is going to excel at these champions despite the simplicity in the concepts of their design. I think there are a lot of variables to consider and while it looks OP mechanically speaking for certain champions it is outweighed by the champions that are now viable. I think with some minor changes to mark you will change your perspective on it but also when you are given champions that actually rely on the ability. I think then you will understand but you are entitled to your opinion.\n\nMS increases don't do much in aram even with the horn there is so much sieging and slows and stuns and roots in aram and less coordination amongst teammates. I typically enjoy playing the tank role in aram and It's actually a pretty awful experience mostly in part because in order to reach your target more often than not you are burning flash or poked upon reaching your target. It's generally only easy if you're nautilus anything else is rather difficult. Blitzcrank also being an exception but for other offensive tanks or bruisers aram is pretty crap as they only get to make a play once every 5 minutes where as most other champions can make theirs within the 1-2 minute range depending on the champion they are. There are minor balance problems I think with mark right now but it is a much better experience for me and will be even when they nerf it.","replies":[{"poster":"Ghost Monster","date":"2015-04-30T03:21:06.205+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"tl;dr I have no idea how to play tanks in aram without a free half map flash on a 20 second cooldown.\n\nTanks were fine.  I'm getting tired of explaining it, but they were never useless and the people who thought they were were bad at aram and most likely really low elo at it.  Sure there were god tier super long range pokes, but as long as my team had one or two pokes on it I would never roll a tank.  The team with the tank and poke was the team that would win if the other team only had poke.  Tanks were merely like the supports of aram.  They were best played as anti engage early on, and then after mid game rolled around they became strong enough to be able to start engaging and breaking past the zones created by the poke champs.  \n\nPeople who thought that melees were weak were doing it wrong.  I never felt useless as a melee, and you never needed more than two sources of poke.  Now the best teams would be all melees.  ARAM was actually fairly balanced to those of us that actually learned to play it, and I own all but 16 champs and have nearly 2000 games in ARAM.  Mark is broken and has turned ARAM into a tank meta.  \n\nWere there OP characters before?  Absolutely.  But now more characters have become unviable than before.  A lot more champs are unplayable with this spell.  The spell is cancer and needs a sever nerf or better yet it just needs to be removed.  Melees were fine and some were even god tier, like Wu Kong.  This spell is the completely wrong way to fix a problem that was actually never there.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Delioth","date":"2015-04-29T23:55:26.013+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreed, the fact that it's on a 20 second CD makes it feel like the CD refund for going in on it just isn't useful...

That's crazy. There is no incentive to take flash unless the skill is nerfed slightly. Flash incentives right now it involves a gauranteed gap closer, defense and offensive capabilities. But for a tank flash is useless compared to mark, which it probably would nearly always be. But we still want to keep incentive for other people to want flash such as an adc, ap or squishy assassin.\n\n The trade off of them taking mark would be sitting ducks mostly and utilizing it outside of being a tank could ultimately be death for a majority of squishies without a form of escape. (Granted they could take both) Typically I enjoy taking exhaust with it as a tank so I can peel for my team better but also if I need to also get somebody caught after engaging on them with it. I think the spell is good but it's too good where it stands. \n\nThe reverse argument I have for you is how many summoner abilities recharge as fast as mark? None not nearly! Not near by almost 10 x the recharge rate. That's insane not counting you landing + dashing for even further CD at that point it is almost 15 X. I'd actually be fine for the damage to be completely removed if the ability could function as transportation for champions who rely on it. But the cooldown would still need to sit around 45 seconds to 1 minute for it to retain any sense of balance. \n\nTransportation alone is valuable for these champions. They usually either have the damage or have the defense long enough for them to kill their enemy and not need the extra damage while nice it is not necessary. The thing we want is to create incentives for other summoner spells. Right now mark does everything too well. Reliable damage source for a summoner, transportation, and in comparison to cool downs it's 10-15x shorter than any other summoner spell and in my opinion should be considered the best given it's current state. \n\nIt needs nerfs to both damage and the cooldown. That I know to be true and I don't even deny that. It became viable just as a method of transportation, which it was designed and meant to do. It did what was intended now it's time to scrape away the extras.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Gazragar","date":"2015-05-07T00:44:40.580+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"Full agreement on the CD suggestion.
