I really liked when you added the warning marker, but with youmuus giving him MS that doesn&#039;t really change much. Now that he is showing up in so many of my games I can&#039;t help but think he&#039;s a bit strong. I believe(maybe im wrong) that he was intended to be a hyper snowbally champion that gave the player the fantasy of getting max trophies to have a superior champion, but could be shut down. Currently his numbers are so high that he is gauranteed to kill a champion of his choice at pretty much any point in the game, and considering he no longer loses stacks on death it&#039;s pretty much always worth it for him to jump in for an easy kill, even if it means a high chance of death afterwards.","replies":[{"poster":"MLDzXnRRR","date":"2015-11-20T07:09:04.733+0000","up_votes":26,"down_votes":6,"body":"You can see that Rengar is getting constant nerfs since release.
