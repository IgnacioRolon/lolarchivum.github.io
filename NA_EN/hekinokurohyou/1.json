Invariably it always leads to the enemy team getting a baron with no vision on them, and multiple dragons. The question is, will there actually be any punishment for these players who are ruining games? If they always queue for support and refuse to buy the KEY item for their role...they are ruining so many games every day.","replies":[{"poster":"DaenrysTargaryen","date":"2017-09-23T02:11:38.909+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"it is not reportable, it is stupid not to buy them but it is not reportable","replies":[{"poster":"Hekinokurohyou","date":"2017-09-23T02:13:03.592+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"its literally not doing your best to win the game :l","replies":[{"poster":"UnboundHades","date":"2017-09-23T02:17:06.651+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"not really if they manage to do well without vision and arent running down mid then they are fine","replies":[]},{"poster":"Beas7ie","date":"2017-09-23T02:17:11.350+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Yiff My Tailhole,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=AgUAa1hT,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2017-09-23T02:13:03.592+0000)\n>\n> its literally not doing your best to win the game :l\n\nBut Rito has stated over adn over and over and over that they will NOT punish people for going \"off meta\".
