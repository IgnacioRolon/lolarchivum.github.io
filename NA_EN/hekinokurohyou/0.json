I dont see how its fair considering hes playing on a primarily english speaking server and speaks no english except to insult people. Also, i speak some chinese and most of what he said in chinese was rude too...soooooooooooooo. This isnt an appeal to overturn my ban. This is just how ridiculous the race issue is and how broad the &quot;hate speech&quot; report can be. Its honestly sad.\n\nEdit: oh yeah, the chinese guy was first pick and just PICKS jinx and expects our adc to swap with him? like regardless of what she wants. then when she doesnt he starts cursing her out in chinese/broken english in champ select.\n\nYiff My Tailhole: lol\nYiff My Tailhole: well. hopefully after this you will be banned and will go back to playing on chinese servers\nYiff My Tailhole: noone knows wtf you are saying\nYiff My Tailhole: mf. i was talking to the jinx lol\nYiff My Tailhole: gotta respect the leona all in\nYiff My Tailhole: dude who taught you english?\nYiff My Tailhole: lol\nYiff My Tailhole: goit enough pinks on that dragon?\nYiff My Tailhole: thank jesus\nYiff My Tailhole: lol\nYiff My Tailhole: wish i lived but my stopwatch wasnt up\nYiff My Tailhole: one play?\nYiff My Tailhole: k nah\nYiff My Tailhole: im done\nYiff My Tailhole: so were you\nYiff My Tailhole: sitting here\nYiff My Tailhole: pot calling the kettle black\nYiff My Tailhole: im not going to argue with you\nYiff My Tailhole: you&#039;re wrong and you know it.\nYiff My Tailhole: lol\nYiff My Tailhole: that is you getting fucked\nYiff My Tailhole: what a silly game\nYiff My Tailhole: mind reporting my adcs? the jinx first picked for mf without asking but mf handled it like a big baby\nYiff My Tailhole: you dont think you are to blame for your own actions?\nYiff My Tailhole: aatrox\nYiff My Tailhole: help with baron\nYiff My Tailhole: lol\nYiff My Tailhole: i think we broke the leona\nYiff My Tailhole: XD\nYiff My Tailhole: gottem\nYiff My Tailhole: bruh. do you ever stop?\nYiff My Tailhole: you&#039;re already getting deported to china so shut up already\nYiff My Tailhole: XD\nYiff My Tailhole: ow\nYiff My Tailhole: id be laughing if we didnt have this jinx typing everyones scores like a shout caster XD\nYiff My Tailhole: omg\nYiff My Tailhole: jinx gave me cancer","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Tantram","date":"2018-04-03T22:17:37.354+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":1,"body":"You were not banned for this.

Only player behavior specialists can help you reverse a false positive punishment. \n\nTrying to convince us a partial truth is a whole truth is a waste of your time and a waste of our time because you won't learn how to reform because you're hiding the true nature of your punishment, which ultimately means you will continue to make the same toxic mistakes, which will get you permabanned in the long run.\n\nIs misrepresenting the facts and trying to get sympathy really worth losing champs, skins, emotes, etc...?

Some non-English speaking people are bound to be playing on the NA server, and you being a jerk to them because they don't speak English is as bad as the player you got punished for harassing being equally bad with what little English he could/may have known.\n\nGranted, if they don't speak English, there's a fair chance they might not understand it, but regardless, that doesn't give you the right to be an asshole to them.\n\n> ...and most certainly dont presume i would ever act like that scum bag.\n\nThey're not. They are simply saying, \"if you played on a different server that primarily speaked a non-English language, would you be okay with people being assholes to you for not being able to speak their language?\"\n\nNowhere do they bring up the thought of you acting like the other player, and they certainly aren't defending their misbehavior.
