Some of these bundles came with exclusive skins like Black Alistar and Young Ryze.\n\nYou had to purchase both the Champions Bundle and Collector's Pack to obtain all of the launch roster. And it obviously didn't include skins (only contained the special skins that came with the bundle but otherwise no other skins) and it was only at the very start of the game when there was like 40 champs and it doesn't extend to any releases beyond what's included in the pack.\n\nWhat I'm referring to is basically is being able to purchase an \"unlocked\" status for your account where all contents in the game are unlocked for now and any content in the future as if you have purchased the golden pass to the game that holds the key to everything that will ever be in the game in 1 go, which is atm only available (I think for free) to tournament players since they're sponsored by Riot.\n\nNeedless to say, a sensible price for something like that probably will never exceed $200 dollars so long we're not dealing with ripoffs. And obviously Riot can't have that, since they want to sell you bits and pieces each worth $10-15 dollars; and such a privilege is only given to pro players who've each on their own already made Riot thousands if not millions.","replies":[{"poster":"PhoenixArc","date":"2019-08-23T00:29:09.580+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So essentially you want a Season Pass included in the game which unlocks every skin Riot will ever make, every champion Riot ever creates, and every event Riot ever puts out.\n\nYou also realize that Season Pass' only really exist for games where the amount of DLC is limited.  Riot is planning on releasing content until people stop playing their game.  They have to somehow keep up revenue to not only make the game better, but to also keep releasing content that people enjoy (and give people a decent paycheck).\n\nThe core function of the game is still available to you without any money spent.  None of it is pay to win (which it technically used to be with the old Rune system) and you can enjoy the game to its fullest.  Skins can be obtained for free and there is nothing locking you out of gamemodes.\n\nDo you honestly believe with EVERY skin and champion Riot has released, that a measly 200$ is a fair price to charge?  You've probably paid more money than that buying coffee every now and then and yet you still do it.  The difference is, the 5$ skin you just got, you can keep using over and over and over again.  This is a business model that doesnt lock you out of content that is intrinsic to the game.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"DeleteSuppRole","date":"2019-08-21T18:47:42.089+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"The game is free, no one is holding a gun to your head and forcing you to play the game, you chose to do so, you're willingly putting time into the game by your own choice, if time is money you're exchanging the time you spend playing for entertainment instead of said \"money\" however that form of entertainment is provided to you for free, so this argument is always in favor of riot, i pretty much consider anyone complaining about the items riot put in the store for money an entitled brat.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-08-22T06:51:17.756+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SEKAI,realm=OCE,application-id=Ir7ZrJjF,discussion-id=AKNt8aHx,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2019-08-21T17:38:54.979+0000)\n>\n> If there is an option to purchase the entire game for $60, hell make it $100, and it unlock all champions, all current and future skins, emotes etc, a LOT of people would pay that without even blinking an eye.\n> \n> Why doesn't Riot do that?
