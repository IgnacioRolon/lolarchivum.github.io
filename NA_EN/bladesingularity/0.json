So, I'm working on a writing project for Xayah and Rakan, and I realized that there are a bunch of blind spots in their lore.  So I've got a couple questions.  If you have an idea, feel free to comment, and I really hope to hear from a Rioter about this - it would mean a lot to me.\r\n\r\nAnyway, let's get into the questions (WARNING TO RIOTERS - if you comment, I may reply with more questions because I forgot some here ...)\r\n\r\n1. In Vlonqo (the town where the two first meet), Xayah is on a mission to recover a stolen artifact.  Any ideas on what it is, such as a name or a description?\r\n\r\n2. Through Xayah and Rakan's bios, stories, or in-game quotes/interactions, there have been a bunch of teased events that I'm curious about.  Honorable mentions are the \"tavern brawl\" scene Xayah mentions in one of her first move quotes, the Affae Waterfall, and the first time Rakan experiences an ally death.  Any details about these scenes would be appreciated, and any details on Xayah and Rakan's first missions together would be helpful too.\r\n\r\n3. Speaking of the \"tavern brawl\" scene and the Affae Waterfall, can someone explain the difference?  Xayah says, \"We pledged ourselves to each other in the middle of a tavern brawl,\" so would this be like the marriage scene in _Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End_ (sorry, closest thing I can think of out of movies I've seen), or is this a vastayan mating tradition (most likely something like this, since Rakan does ask \"You going to marry me today?\" as one of his in-game quotes, which suggests they aren't married)?  Or is the Affae Waterfall the actual site where whichever of the two options I mentioned happened?  Sorry if this question seems a bit complicated.\r\n\r\n4. Is there any way I could get translations for the vastayan language Xayah and Rakan use?  For example, what do their nicknames for each other (\"mieli' and 'miella') mean?  And what about that joke Rakan makes (one of his movement quotes when Xayah is near, not sure how to spell what he says) in vastayan language?  Or the line Xayah chants (movement quote when Rakan is too far away or not on her team)?  Created languages in League have always interested me, and I'm curious to see what Xayah and Rakan are actually saying.\r\n\r\nI may have forgotten some questions ... so I'll add an \"EDIT\" notice if I do change this post.  Thank you!","replies":[{"poster":"JacctheInsomniac","date":"2017-12-22T00:55:15.001+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"BladeSingularity","date":"2017-12-22T03:41:20.366+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is an excellent point too ...  I think, based on some of Xayah's lines, that her idea is to \"free magic\" - but what exactly that entails isn't entirely clear.  Does that mean just destroying Zed's temples, or reclaiming their old lands from Ionians completely?\n\nThanks for adding this though!","replies":[{"poster":"WAAARGHbobo","date":"2017-12-22T17:37:39.520+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":0,"body":"So I can't do spoilers.

Vlonqo is a town with a monastery and a Quinlon.   An' no.  I'm not going to tell you what a Quinlon is.  'Cause I'm a stinker.  (also cause I don't remember if I've spelled it right)\n\n2.  a) Xayah views their relationship as starting after a tavern brawl.  b) they had the sexy time there-- it's very scenic. It's just a nice memory.  c) Ally_Death should be viewed as a \"what if\" scenario-- and often purely as a joke.\n\n3. The Vastayan culture's relationship and marriage rituals are somewhat different than ours-- in part because magic is literally a part of them and their landscape.   Their culture is big on declarations.  Symbolically when you declare something it becomes true-- but with the magic the vastayan's use-- those sort of declarations also form a weak charm.   Reinvoking it maintains its status and makes others aware.   From an american perspective the are not married or even engaged, and would self-describe as \"a couple.\"  --But for a Vastaya declaring someone your boyfriend/girlfriend is a much bigger deal than for americans.  It means you are allowing your magics to entwine.\n\n4.  mieli' and 'miella'    =\"my love\" in masculine and fem.   Other words I don't have in front of me. But I'm sure the boards or wiki's have documented the translations somewheres (it's come up several times) \n\n\nHope this helps.\n\n- O","replies":[{"poster":"BladeSingularity","date":"2017-12-22T23:08:03.459+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Warning: I came up with more questions ... sorry!\n\n1. You mentioned that Xayah sees the tavern scene as the beginning of their relationship.  But what event does Rakan consider to be the beginning?\n\n2. Regarding the artifact in Vlonqo, is it in the monastery or the Quinlon?  And can you describe it a bit?  I may need a brief description for what I'm writing.\n\n3. Where in the timeline of Xayah and Rakan's relationship is _Wild Magic_?  I'm guessing after the tavern scene, but before or after Affae?  Not sure here.\n\n4.  At this point all I have to go on is Xayah and Rakan's first meeting, the tavern scene, Affae, and _Wild Magic_.  Are there any other important scenes from their early days I'm missing?  And what's the approximate time difference between each scene (days, weeks, months)?\n\nIf you don't mind answering those too, thank you!

Remember Rakan's emotional intelligence and self awareness is threw the roof.  Also he's very \"present\" all the time. --He lives in the moment.  Rakan was aware of his emotional journey as it happened--  he knew he was interested.. then he knew he was falling for her, then knew he was into her etc...    It's not a singular moment for Rakan it was a journey.  \n\n2. You've seen a roughly built shadow magic Quinlon destroyed.   Most do not gather shadow magic.\n\n3.  It is not a part of the timeline.  Promotion team just takes inspiration from the lore-- they do not make stuff within the timelines.  Because...  uh.. Reasons?   Well you'd have to ask them.\n\n4. Yep that's what you've got.  What has not been written has not been written.  --one thing to keep in mind though as soon as you enter a vastayan forest, time --as we know it--  becomes to be less reliable.   This is the border to the spirit world,  so time can go strangely --Days can become years; or months can become seconds in the world outside of the forest.","replies":[{"poster":"BladeSingularity","date":"2017-12-23T18:06:05.407+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay, thanks.
