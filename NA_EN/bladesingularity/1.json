So, tomorrow, November 28, (well, tomorrow as of posting this) is the one year anniversary of Elementalist Lux's release, and I wanted to share a tidbit I noticed.  It's quite possible someone mentioned this before and I never noticed, so I apologize if I'm not giving credit where it's due.\n\nhttps://1.bp.blogspot.com/-TKOveeiSMss/WCtoYqId02I/AAAAAAAAYVU/BoxOe4Gk9gw7KfoWqyoPGanleHw36u07QCLcB/s1600/Lux_Splash_7.jpg\n\nSo ... take a look at Elementalist Lux's splash art.  Pretty, right?  Well, for now I want to focus on that stained glass window behind Lux.\n\nThe first thing that you might notice is a butterfly at the leftmost edge of the circle (let's call it to the west, as if the circular window is a compass).  And you might also notice a familiar-looking shape at the bottom (or South).\n\nRecognize them?  The butterfly is the symbol for Mystic, and the other shape is the symbol for Ice.\n\nBy that reasoning, the symbols for Magma and Storm should also be on the glass window - probably at North and East (which are cut off in the splash).  But which is where?\n\nNow, it's time to look towards the center of the glass.  At the very center is the symbol for Light (the bottom of it is hidden by the enchanted gem from Lux's staff, which she is holding up).  If you look diagonally downward to the left, you can see, just barely, part of the symbol for Water, mostly hidden behind Lux.\n\nWell, Water makes sense in that exact spot, since Ice and Mystic both require a combination including Water.  Ice needs Air too, and you can see the top of that symbol at the right edge of the splash.  As for Earth (I'm calling it Earth, so those who call it Nature, don't get mad at me) ... you can _barely_ make out the very edge of the symbol at the top of the splash.\n\nSince we know where Water, Earth and Air are, it stands to reason that Fire is in the hidden (because the splash art doesn't include it) spot, diagonally upward to the right.  Now, what about Magma and Storm?\n\nAir is downward to the right, and Fire is upward to the right, so Storm is at the rightmost edge (or East).  Therefore, the remaining spot, the top, goes to Magma, since that is the spot between Earth and Fire.\n\nSo that's all nine elements ... wait ...\n\nWhat about Dark, you may ask?  Why isn't it represented?\n\nThere are two possibilities.  (You don't need to read this part, just my theories.)  One, since Dark can only result from the combination of opposing elements (Water and Fire or Earth and Air), and the only possible spot in the glass technically in between opposing elements is the center, where Light is ... maybe whoever made that stained glass decided to just leave it out.  Or, two, a - sorry - _darker_ theory is that Dark is viewed as a forbidden element, and anyone who uses it or has an affinity for it is exiled, or possibly even executed.  In [The Light Within](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjrfYZsZLJA), for example, when Lux makes the transformation from Fire to Dark, she seems almost resigned to her fate (yes, there are many other interpretations of that scene, just giving one possibility here).  That could suggest that she saw it as an absolute last resort, only to be used if there is no other option left.  And on a simpler note, if an element is forbidden, it makes sense that whoever made that window would leave a forbidden symbol out of the design.\n\nAnyway, that's it for now.  Hope you all liked this little discovery of mine (I think ... if someone else found it first, sorry then)!\n\nEDIT: Right now while I'm adding this, it's 11/28.  Happy 1st Birthday/Anniversary, Elementalist Lux!","replies":[{"poster":"Final Spark Lux","date":"2017-11-28T04:16:11.778+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am disgusted by the fact that a year has somehow already passed since I purchased this skin. How has it been a YEAR already? I feel like I bought it a few weeks ago. Also https://i.gyazo.com/ca2daea947af0f840ef6f7b20a06434b.png this sounds like what you're describing, but slightly rotated. \n\nThat video Riot made for the skin is -really- powerful. It...makes me feel ways I probably shouldn't. It also makes me feel sad that Lux was driven to that point. Normally Lux is all about the light, but after all she had been through, I can't say I blame her. \n\nEdit: Also, I never really remember dates of skins, though I do always remember Lux's birthday; but in honor of her skins anniversary, I think I'll finally buy the last skin of hers I don't currently own (which would be Sorc. Don't ask why the cheapest one somehow ended up being the one I never bought) Thanks for the post lol","replies":[{"poster":"Placentas","date":"2017-11-28T06:59:01.754+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dude same, I saw a thread about this years ultimate skin and I was like, wait, isn't that Lux's?
