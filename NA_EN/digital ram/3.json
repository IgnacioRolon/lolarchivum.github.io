{"poster":"Digital Ram","date":"2014-12-11T19:38:25.020+0000","title":"[Bug] My patcher will not open after patch 4.21!","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":11,"down_votes":2,"body":"Hey everyone, \n\nWe've noticed that there has been an increase in players that are experiencing issues with the 4.21 Patch. We have three potential fixes that may resolve this issue for you guys:\n\n1) Localhosts files have been negatively affecting this patch. Players who have 0.0.0.0 as their localhost are not able to open the game. We are currently investigating this issue, in the meantime players can try to run a Host File reset by using the [Microsoft Fixit](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/972034). \n\n***NOTE***: This will reset your Hosts file. As long as you run the Microsoft Fixit, this shouldn't negatively impact your computer. If you are playing from a Campus or from a restricted Network, you should verify with your Network Administrator before altering these files. \n\n2) For players using Avast! Antivirus, another potential fix for this issue is to uninstall the program. Avast may be blocking the connection between your computer and our patcher server.  Please run the [Avast Uninstall Utility](http://www.avast.com/en-us/uninstall-utility). \n\n3) Another fix is to run through the [Patching Issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202969434-Patching-Issues) article on our support site! It has a list of the most common solutions for these types of issues.\n\n\nPlayers affected by patching issues can also help us investigate further by attaching their Patcher Logs by following these steps:\n\n- Navigate to Your Installation Location (Generally C:) > Riot Games > League of Legends > Logs > Patcher Logs\n\n- Find the most recent patcher and patcherUx logs. You can find the most up to date by observing the titles.\n The logs should look like this: 2014-12-10T15_LolPatcher.log and 2014-12-10T15_LolPatcherUx.log\n\n- Then Attach it to your post here!\n\n\nIf none of these help resolve your issues, Please [submit a ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) on our support site! Our Tech team can assist further!","replies":[{"poster":"JEST3M DEBILEM","date":"2014-12-12T16:36:53.316+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":1,"body":"Solution:\nGo to your LoL folder -> RADS -> projects -> lol_patcher -> releases and delete folder 0.0.0.14 and then run again lol launcher, enjoy game :D","replies":[{"poster":"Kittyrina","date":"2014-12-19T15:11:45.951+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you!
