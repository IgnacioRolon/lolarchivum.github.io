Well as soon as I go into champion select my screen becomes black. Fine, I repair the client and still the problem exists. Next thing I do is completely redownload League of Legends and still the problem happens. Fine, next step is reinstall Windows 10, redownload League of Legends and still the problem keeps happening once again. I know I can just switch to the new client and things will be fixed but I want to look at my builds that I made because my memory is shit and why such a good system they implemented will not be going to the new client. Any type of help will be amazing on why this problem keeps happening.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-18T23:02:36.261+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"The black screen you're getting is usually caused by a connection problem, not installation.  You could have an unstable connection that's failing to download assets.  You should run through the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide instead to fix this up.
