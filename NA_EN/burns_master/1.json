What usually happens is one bad players lose the game. What you perceive as a good player carrying is almost always bad players losing the game and it gives the appearance of the good player dominating but really it comes back that crapper on your team who fed and then let them roam. Nothing worse than that 5 death in 12 minute laner who then spends the rest of the game pinging \"mia\" while they stand behind their turret last hitting suddenly fearful of dying now that they are worth no gold and their opposing laner is able to win 2v1's....","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"I Main Swain","date":"2018-03-30T14:45:00.887+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"the game being too snowbally and also being able to be ruined by one player arent opposites.  as far as snowballing goes, the real culprits are team shut down gold (which theyre planning on getting rid of to make the game a lot more individually impactful), the squishiness of turrets combined with their team gold bonus, and the power buff you can potentially get from getting drake/herald.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ZaneShadow","date":"2018-03-29T16:52:34.868+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"That you are quite the Thicc Bricc. \n\nAnyways memes aside,  I wish that the gold value of champ kills grew and dropped faster.

Reaching mid game at all is completely dependent on your team precisely because the game snowballs too hard preventing contributions from anyone but the worst player who is likely getting mercilessly camped.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Meep Man","date":"2018-03-30T15:33:48.397+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"The whole \"one person can lose you the game, but one person can't win you the game,\" is a paradox in and of itself.
