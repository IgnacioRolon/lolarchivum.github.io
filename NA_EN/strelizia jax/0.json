Of course, as Jax levels up, his bonus magic damage from his enhanced auto attacks would go up too.\r\n\r\nIdeas for build with Jax would be Guinsoo's, since this item lets Jax proc his third auto more, and the AP would give him more damage with the enhanced auto, and he would get magic resist to deal with the late game hypercarry magic champions.\r\n\r\nAnother good build would be triple Infinity Edge since he would gain 120 AD and 120 armor, so he could just be completely amazing against a fed Draven.\r\n\r\nObviously this could be broken, so Riot could tweak the scaling on his passive to only give him maybe half as much armor per AD.\r\n\r\nWhat do you guys think?","replies":[{"poster":"Titanium70","date":"2019-07-13T20:52:20.188+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"See and that's exactly what NEVER EVER should happen.\n\nAdding random Champions Synergy1 traits.\nThat would turn into absolute garbage where actual synergies no longer matter.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PlsRitoRepairS10","date":"2019-07-13T18:06:22.779+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would like to see him on his Nemesis Skin.

I had the same general idea as you with him being like Yasuo and 3 strike mana system. He sai he wanted to see him get full mana and be a jump AoE stun.","replies":[{"poster":"Z3SIeeper","date":"2019-07-13T11:34:59.557+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He'd most likely just do that tbh.\n\nI can see him as a 3/4 star that uses Leap Strike + channels Counterstrike for 2 seconds before stunning surrounding units.\n\nOr possibly just a 1/2 star that only uses Counterstrike (with the damage ramping on hitting him during it thing).\n\nDefinitely can't see him as an auto-based 5 star unit though. Sounds too bland to me as he'd basically just be an auto'ing statstick and not add much more depth to the game with new mechanics and whatnot.","replies":[]}]}]}
