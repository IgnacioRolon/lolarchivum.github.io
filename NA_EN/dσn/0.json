I really hope it stays! I know quite a few people don't like the Gangplank voice and the music, but I love both. I actually really disliked the old announcer and old music. I hope they at least let us change it when the Bilgewater theme is over, because there are some of us who do really appreciate the new Gangplank announcer and music. It puts me in such a good mood as opposed to the other one. I hope it stays.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ExcaIibur Morgan","date":"2015-07-30T01:14:37.474+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{item:3070}} {{item:3070}}  I want GP's announcing to stay. :(","replies":[]},{"poster":"5000000000000000","date":"2015-07-26T07:37:29.527+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I heard the music will stay as an option, but I don't think the announcer VO will stay.","replies":[]}]}
