I normally see how toxic the game is at the postgame chat, and sadly, I see much more toxic postgame chat than silence this season. The community has definitely gotten worse since last season and has gotten exponentially worse since I started back in 2011.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Digital Daddy","date":"2016-11-03T05:23:40.008+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"LOL THE COMEBACKS.

I think they should stop perma banning people, in the last 4yrs I been playing I seen over 30 people get perma banned, my teams best mid player just got perma banned he spent a lot of money on this game which supports Riot and helps them pay their employee's and fund their charity program. Now he wont come back no matter how much we beg him. He doesnt want to grind out the long dreadful 30 levels and get all his runes and whatever. So, it stinks for us. I understand why he got banned because he was negative but in reality people should make better use of their mute or Riot should remove talking before it removes players. I have never been able to type and play anyways so I dont see the problem with it. When your highly invested in something your more likely to stick around so in a sense by perma banning these folks they are setting them free lol. Thats a bad buisness move, hopefully Riot generates all the income it needs from other things besides players buying things.","replies":[]}]}
