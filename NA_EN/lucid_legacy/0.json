I believe the i5-6500 would be the best value for my CPU. The RAM and SSD are completely adequate for streaming. But as far as the GPU goes, I am unsure if I should buy the GTX 970 or the R9 380x. Or maybe I don't need all of that and I can downgrade to the much cheaper GTX 960. But if I downgrade I don't want to bottleneck the entire pc. Any help and suggestions for what I need to do so I can play league on high settings and stream smoothly are highly appreciated","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-07-31T22:48:44.217+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Lucid,\n\nI'm happy to hear that you're about to build a super sweet gaming/streaming rig! Regarding choosing the right video card, there are a ton of factors that this will rely on. But first, let me stress how important it is to have a good upload speed in order to get a good stream bitrate. All the GTX 1080's in the would couldn't output a quality stream if your upload rate is capped at 500Kbps. You can test your upload speed by running a quick test on any speed testing site (common ones are speedtest.net and speakeasy). \n\nOnce you've figured out what upload speed you're dealing with, you'll understand what quality your stream will be limited to. On average, you'll want to have over 2Mbps upload to even think of achieving a stable 1080p 30fps stream to most services. I'm no expert, though, so if you'd like to get an in-depth answer from those who know their stream tech, definitely reach out on the forums of whatever streaming platform you were planning to use.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheSingularity","date":"2016-08-01T01:12:43.292+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would recommend starting on YouTube first. As allot of the high vid quality streamers actually use 2 separate pcs. One to drive their games and the other loaded with speed to drive the stream. Even with that $$$$$$$$ investment they still need the fast stable upload connection for it to be even worth it.\n\n\nAnd until you hit a sub threshold your viewers won't have access to the vid quality option. So if your connection or pc is meh the fps and quality will plummet.\n\nIf you start out on youtube you'll get an idea of your viewer base, upload speed and how much you should invest into streaming","replies":[]},{"poster":"Desiderium","date":"2016-07-31T23:41:19.609+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Streaming is more dependent on your upload speed and the speed of your CPU rather than GPU, but it does have a part in it.","replies":[]}]}
