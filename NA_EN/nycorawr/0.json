I kept it low poly where possible (Tail, etc), but because I know just a little bit less than nothing about rendering engines, the only program I am truly comfortable with for renders is poser so.... Stuff like the fur, water, etc, got exported as way higher poly than it needed to be but, it looks good, didn&#039;t kill my PC, and rendered in less than 2 hours so, we&#039;re good.\r\nIt took a total of about 40 hours, not because it should have, but because I just started learning Zbrush so there were many &quot;i can do that better&#039;s&quot;. Once I was satisfied with each piece I exported them as OBJ files to poser and created dynamic clothing for a base model. The base human model was then exported to Zbrush and I assigned many.. many morph&#039;s to import back into Poser so she looks like a Nami and not like a genderless mannequin.\r\nAnyway, I like her, there are things I want to change but I&#039;m really just sick of looking at it by now so, I hope you like my Nami-Tee.\r\nSculpted in Zbrush Textured in Zbrush/Photoshop Rendered in Poser 2014 using Firefly\r\nFinal render is 9000x9000 300DPI and took around 2 hours.\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\nHere&#039;s the same image on a grey background so you can see a bit better.\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/IgmIlXd.jpg [2]\r\nWallpaper Sized: http://i.imgur.com/y5ngHYY.jpg [3]\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n(I did Janna too from way back when, here she is: http://i.imgur.com/cWtk5jO.png )","replies":[{"poster":"Kindlejack","date":"2015-04-16T04:19:53.272+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"That is amazing >:O\n\nI'm glad people really 'got' the joke with Nami being Urf's number 1 fan and cosplaying as him. I imagine as a young kipper she had posters of Urf on her walls and would tweet nasty comments to anyone Urf was publicly seen with.\n\nLove that Janna too - those boots...
