Dragon spawns in random variations, giving different buffs!\n\nEdit: I'm not quite sure what the details are, they said \"the mini-site comes out three days before this podcast\", but  earth dragon seem to allow splitpushing, wind gives MS/Janna passive, Water boosts regeneration, Fire gives damage.\n\nEdit2: Malzahars ult devours someone with three giant voidlings, apparently.\n\nEdit3: They've talked broadly about items and the removal of mage mana regen for a while now. \n\nEdit4: They seem to have taken down the podcast for now, but I can still listen. They're starting to talk about some mage updates now!\n\nEdit5: I'ts hard to figure out what the mechanics are because they assumed the info would be out already so they're not explaining the kits in detail. Brand seem to put \"bombs\" on people, the ult in particular prioritizing to put bombs on people that isn't \"bombed\" yet.\n\nEdit6: Haha, they really are like giggling fanboys! They didn't go through all the changes, basically they just fanboyed about a few specific things and no details. (Leaked Cassio, Ziggs finishing towers, Xerath is awesome-er, Fiddle has a bunch of changes but they where vague about the specifics.)","replies":[{"poster":"Meep Man","date":"2016-04-19T18:12:58.789+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not sure I exactly agree with COMPLETELY random Dragon spawn. It would be a lot cooler if you could somewhat control which Dragon came, such as an across the map \"Quest\" that can be done to \"summon\" the specific dragon next time it spawns.","replies":[{"poster":"Dreampod","date":"2016-04-19T18:23:19.510+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually completely disagree.  I think having something random like that allows a skillset that normally doesn't get much workout in League, the ability to adapt on the fly, a chance to shine.  League has lots of room for micro-based skill to show off but less for strategic so I'm excited to see how it plays out.","replies":[{"poster":"Meep Man","date":"2016-04-19T18:28:20.377+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is also true actually. The ability to adapt ({{champion:121}} ?) should be a needed skill and this enforces it. I'm just a little afraid that, with the Dragons, relatively longish spawn time, that this could make some games feel decided from RNG, such as if the enemy team has a big split push comp and Earth Dragon spawns frequently in a game.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Meep Man","date":"2016-04-19T18:00:47.542+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"No link, no proof.\n\nEDIT:\nHere it is\nhttps://soundcloud.com/leaguecommunity/ep-18-inside-midseason-magic","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2016-04-19T18:04:21.287+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mention of the elemental dragon system coming in the mid-season patch is indeed in the podcast! \n\nWe should have a micro site up with a general mid-season rundown shortly, along with a more detailed discussion of what we're doing with the dragons and why in a separate forum post.","replies":[{"poster":"Malicious Metal","date":"2016-04-19T18:21:52.663+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can Morde enslave every single dragon?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Solideus","date":"2016-04-19T18:07:17.677+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Very excited! :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ez dePaz","date":"2016-04-19T18:25:12.719+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aw itÂ´s down ):","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Solideus","date":"2016-04-19T18:02:40.818+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Check the podcast! :)\nEdit: https://soundcloud.com/leaguecommunity/ep-18-inside-midseason-magic","replies":[{"poster":"Meep Man","date":"2016-04-19T18:05:48.655+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see now.
