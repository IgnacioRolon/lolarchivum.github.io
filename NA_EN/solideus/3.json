You wouldn't see everyone carrying a hextech pistol on their hip. In fact, walking around with such a weapon for everyone to see would quickly garner the sort of attention you don't want. Unless you're Graves, who is perfectly happy with that sort of attention. Destiny is a unique gun that very few smiths in the world would have any hope in replicating. In the story world, you wouldn't necessarily see the exact type of effects as you see in-game. \n\nI hope that helps.","replies":[{"poster":"Sneak Dog","date":"2015-07-08T15:49:26.314+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"Sooo... guns're hextech.

Their guns use bullets and gunpowder.\n\n{{champion:18}} similarly uses a cannon, and it's just a full blown cannon. No trace of hextech in sight.\n\nI'd argue that {{champion:222}} has only one hextech weapon, that being Zapper, but I'm not 100% sure if Pow-Pow and Fishbones are hextech or not.\n\nLeague's cast is a bunch of the more remarkable folks who live in Runeterra. The fact the many have hextechnology at their disposal isn't all that surprising.","replies":[{"poster":"Solideus","date":"2015-07-09T10:26:40.282+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Jinx likely got her guns from Piltover and/or Zaun, so it wouldn't be surprising for them to have a fair bit of hextech in 'em.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2015-07-08T18:19:30.095+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Sooo.... you can't read.

Just straight up d&d style hits easier and deals more damage, or more esoteric things like bullet bending, or lighting a sword on fire, or firing lighting from your spear? or other fantastical effects?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Solideus","date":"2015-07-09T10:33:00.360+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks a lot for replying!
