Could we discuss why the \"Unique Playstyle\" champ's don't have these Subclasses?","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":6,"down_votes":4,"body":"Hello! I think the subclass categorization is a great way to work with champions, both for improving design and for new players to find and understand champions they&#039;ll enjoy.\r\n\r\nI don&#039;t, however, think &quot;Unique Playstyle&quot; is a useful category, and an unique kit shouldn&#039;t disqualify them from being categorized in a way that makes sense. The output of the kit can still be categorized in some way. \r\n\r\nAnyway, the subclass DOESN&#039;T have to fit PERFECTLY, they are only a loose definition so you have common ground for discussing a champion, but these champions need that common ground too. They don&#039;t fit perfectly anywhere, but there&#039;s a category that best suits their needs.\r\n\r\nThese following subclass-categories make sense to me; I&#039;d love to hear you argue why they don&#039;t work for the champion. That goes for you other forum-goers as well, of course!\r\n\r\n* {{champion:31}} - **Battle Mage** (Hybrid Juggernaut)\r\n* {{champion:53}} - **Disruptor **(Hybrid Warden)\r\n* {{champion:27}} - **Juggernaut**\r\n* {{champion:9}}  - (Jungling) **Disruptor**\r\n* {{champion:85}} - **Disruptor** (Hybrid Battle Mage)\r\n* {{champion:6}} -  Too Be Determined. Post rework, possibly Battle Mage or Artillery\r\n\r\nI don&#039;t think those are nonsensical categorizations! The new Controller/Disruptor categories really filled a gap in the class-categories, which you might have underestimated! I think some of these champions have had confused identities because they&#039;re actually Disruptors! Great news, Woho!\r\n\r\n**Here&#039;s my rationale behind the categories for each champion:**\r\n\r\n* **Cho&#039;Gath**: He&#039;s a lumbering, often kite-able, titan with a kit that plays like a mid-range mage;\r\nTherefore, **Battle Mage** with a splash of **Juggernaut**.\r\n\r\n* **Blitzcrank**: Compare him to Taric (Enchanter + Warden-Hybrid) for a second; Blitzcrank is what you would expect of the tanky melee Disruptor counterpart to Taric.\r\nTherefore, **Disruptor **with a splash of **Warden**.\r\n\r\n* **Singed**: He wants to splitpush and wants to be chased, but that&#039;s irrelevant to what subclass he is, IMHO. Ultimately he (should be) kiteable but tanky and brings a lot of sustained dmg, so I can&#039;t see him as anything but a Juggernaut. Looking at his kit, most of his abilities look like those of other Juggernauts.\r\nTherefore, **Juggernaut**, _possibly_ with a splash of something like Disruptor, Battle Mage, etc.\r\n\r\n* **Fiddlesticks**: Unlike other Disruptors he&#039;s a dedicated Jungler, but that shouldn&#039;t be held against him; Kindred is still a Marksman, after all. In summary, despite his archaic kit, you find in it what you&#039;d expect from a non-laning Disruptor, I think.\r\nTherefore, **Disruptor**.\r\n\r\n* **Kennen**: He is a flex-pick, but let&#039;s stick with the primary mage-y version. What&#039;s most iconic about Kennen? His Passive and Ult. He locks down opponents and entire battlefields (Disruptor) and has the tools to go into the thick of battle (Battle Mage).\r\nTherefore, **Disruptor** with a splash of **Battle Mage**.\r\n\r\n* **Urgot**: Kind of irrelevant, as his kit is archaic and will change so much after the eventual rework that there&#039;s basically no use arguing what to call him yet. But I&#039;m SURE he&#039;ll belong to some subclass once his modernizing VGU is finished! That one is just a matter of waiting for the drop! Because his E-Q is likely to stay I&#039;d guess Artillery or Battle Mage, though.\r\n\r\n***\r\nThat&#039;s it, please bring your viewpoint to the discussion! What do you agree/disagree with? I hope some Reds chime in too!\r\n\r\n//Best Regards, Solideus","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2016-06-09T02:09:58.668+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hi!\n\nWe went back on forth on those champs quite a lot, with some similar arguments to those you've outlined being made.

Have these groups been considered before? If an issue with marksmen is that they're too similar in terms of what they do, would you consider doing another class update to nudge them towards greater separation?","replies":[{"poster":"Solideus","date":"2016-06-09T07:53:28.031+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I personally think Marksmen, if anything, are better served with hybrid-subclasses than they would with their own subclasses, at least right now. \"Powerhouse\" marksmen are \"pure\" marksmen, while others simply borrows things from non-marksmen classes.

You're also right that the other two subclasses I mentioned tend to be closer to others for different roles, with utility-oriented marksmen borrowing from Enchanters and duel-oriented marksmen having similarities to assassins or divers. With that said, though, many other subclasses have some running similarities, e.g. Juggernauts vs. Battle Mages, Disruptors vs. some Battle or Burst Mages, Divers vs. Vanguards, etc., so it would still make sense for marksmen to have their own subclasses, even if those have direct, or at least very close, connections to subclasses in other roles.\n\nI also suspect a major issue getting in the way of marksman classification is that, even though there likely are marksman subclasses, practically every marksman dips into two or more of these tentative groups at a time. BluePolarizer mentioned above, for example, that Kalista is a top-tier duelist, despite also having a very ally-oriented kit, and that Sivir provides huge amounts of both AoE damage and team utility. Even the most duel-centric marksmen, like Kindred, Quinn or Vayne, are much more able to switch or chain targets than, say, assassins or even some divers, and having kits with limited innate waveclear doesn't really mitigate their pushing power once they boost their autoattacks well enough. The issue isn't necessarily with marksmen being OP or overloaded, though I feel the class as a whole might be a bit too strong relative to the others, but with there being few explicit tradeoffs between different kinds of marksman-specific power, and consequently often few differences in playstyle or general contribution.","replies":[{"poster":"Solideus","date":"2016-06-09T11:06:22.718+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Absolutely, there are similarities between other different Subclasses, but that seems superficial to me because those that are similar have different primary Classes, so the strength-weakness profiles are actually quite different. The Juggernaut/Vanguard/Battle Mage _Subclasses_ are all more or less \"tough & aggressive\", but that expresses itself _very_ differently for respective _Class_. \n\nAll marksmen are ranged sustained damage threats but they have to keep their distance; otherwise they go down quite fast. Other distinguishing features are secondary to that core profile. Their profile is so specific that Marksmen are more like a Subclass than a Class, really! Anything straying too far away from that would no longer be a marksman, so it's inherently hard to split them into subgroups with distinct core strengths/weaknesses, at least in any useful way.\n\nI don't think there currently is a need to create a split; they are somewhat few and don't really need to become more distinct right now; the Marksman Update was quite successful in doing that already, IMO. To create two sensical Marksmen Subclasses you'd almost have to first divide them and then make each subgroup more similar to each other, which of course would be very counter productive.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"BluePolarizer","date":"2016-06-09T06:01:25.450+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"that's actually pretty good, but typically utility marksmen either end up as powerhouses with huge AOE damage (Ashe and Sivir have huge AOE damage, especially with Runaan's) or as duelists (Kalista is one of the best duelists in the game and Ezreal has pretty high burst).","replies":[{"poster":"Teridax68","date":"2016-06-09T07:25:37.655+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's true; Sivir in particular is known for her tremendous waveclear/AoE through her W + Q, so it's entirely possible that any hypothetical utility marksman subclass could just fit under other subclasses with utility or crowd control as a unique feature. With that said, I think some of that may come from marksmen each going into multiple potential subclasses when they should really be specializing in fewer features (Kalista, for example, has a really confused identity, as her whole theme is ally-centric power but her passive and E make her one of the best duelists in the game, as you mentioned). On one hand, it's difficult to differentiate marksmen because they all do very similar things (i.e. autoattack-based DPS, which usually bleeds into objective control, pushing power, tank-busting, etc.), but one of the main issues with the marksman class is probably because any individual marksman guarantees too many things, which is partly why the class is mandatory above any other in every game.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Solideus","date":"2016-06-11T10:05:01.165+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd argue NO champion fits _perfectly_ into any subclass, so it seems arbitrary to single out the one's you put in \"Unique Gameplay\".

Otherwise he might turn out all over the place!\n\nHis hook is unique and awesome already, and would of course inform what'a appropriate to have on the kit as well, but the subclass helps aligning the rest of his kit in a cohesive direction.

Some of these are pretty old kits, which may contribute to making them complicated to define, but my opinion on that is that picking the right subclass gives a solid direction for filling in what gaps are missing in those old kits and make them make more sense. I don't think finding and filling those gaps would take away from their uniqueness, frankly. They still retain what makes them Unique even if you smooth out the kinks or modernize their abilities, or laser-focus their output-niche!\n\nI'm excited and intrigued by the possibility of new subclasses! The curent ones do a pretty decent job at broadly covering all the bases, so I think the call to add more depends on how specific you want to be. The \"Risk Mage\" makes a lot of sense and fits several champions much better (because it's more specific!), but I could also see an argument for Battle Mage (\"Fragile Battle Mage\"?) or Disruptor (\"Damage-Centric/Damage-Threat-Zone Disruptor\"?) being malleable enough to broadly contain and represent those with the current terminology, if you chose to.\n\nMarksmen I _personally_ don't see a great need to distinguish in the near future; there just doesn't seem to be much value to doing so.

(his ult is tankiness, not in combat defense/sustain) A better classification is vanguard, burst mage as he is a good offensive tank and has very high burst damage.\n\nJuggernaut: A relatively low CC tank that moves slowly and has immense damage potential if not kited. \n\nSinged is a juggernaut, but should primarily be a disruptor. He creates large zones with his poison and glue and has a fair amount of CC. He does have much damage potential and tankiness so juggernaut secondary is good.\n\nDisruptor: creates lasting zones of control that change how the enemy moves/reacts. \n\nBlitzcrank is not a disruptor. Yes he 'disrupts' enemy champions, but he does not fit the description of the disruptor class. No, your champion's existence isn't a zone to play around. I categorized him as only vanguard. He does a great job initiating fights with CC but doesn't fair too well when engaged on.\n\nFiddlesticks is a disruptor with his ult but I feel his battle mage elements with his short range and godly sustain are more prevalent. battle mage, disruptor.\n\nKennen can go any of three directions, disruptor/marksman/battle mage it really has more to do with how he is played than his kit overall.\n\nUrgot... not enough information to make judgment.\n---\nThese are just my thoughts on your classifications, above I linked the original post for ease of access and my post if you want to see proof that I know my sub classes.

I'll be a bit more specific on my thinking with the above champions. I didn't want to be too detailed in the original post to keep it somewhat concise.\n\nI'll use the subclass definitions givien by Riot themselves in their [Devblog](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/gameplay/dev-blog-classes-subclasses) on the subject.\n***\n{{champion:31}} Cho'Gath\n\n>Battle Mages get into the middle of the fray, seeking to wreak havoc upon the entire enemy team with their overwhelming sustained area damage. Due to their relatively short (but not melee) combat ranges and the need to burn down their opponents over time, Battle Mages have significant defensive capabilities that range from sustaining endlessly to literally defying death for a short period of time.\n\nBattle Mages don't have to have small-windowed defenses. In my opinion Cho'Gath's sustain from his passive and heal/tankiness from his ult qualifies as his significant defensive capabilities. \nHis abilities are of similar uptime and output-profile as Swain's, whom is an archetypical Battle Mage. Despite his sustained damage E I can see an argument for Burst Mage, but he IS very tanky and the damage is gated by low range, so I'd err on the side of Battle Mage.\nHard and soft CC isn't prohibited for Battle Mages; many of them have it. I think the Tankyness and kiteability of Cho'Gath is core enough to merit him being a hybrid Juggernaut, though.\n***\n{{champion:27}} Singed\nHe does have Disruptor-like capabilities, but if you look at the [other Juggernauts](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/3A5uuBw7-champion-subclass-list) it isn't unusual for them to have such abilities _witout_ being considered hybrid champions. \nIf he had a hybrid component it could be Disruptor, but Trundle, Volibear, etc, seem to be considered Juggernauts even with similar capabilities.\n***\n{{champion:53}} Blitzcrank\nI actually think his hook is an uniquely dangerous pick-off ability that it merits being considered a threat zone around him, despite otherwise melee abilities. I think he really _**IS**_ a zone of threat to play around. \nIsolating one poor opponent from his team seems like it falls into the Disruptor category. Being tanky and melee is why I consider him a hybrid Warden in the same way Taric is distinguished. \nAlso compare him to the Warden Alistar, which Blitz has a similar disruptive- and peel-capabilities to once in the thick of a fight. That's why I don't consider him a Vanguard anymore.\n***\n{{champion:9}} Fiddlesticks\nI think the ult being Disruptor-esque has huge merit for Fiddlesticks, whom is _very_ reliant on it to succeed. the Fear and crows also seem Disruptor-esque to me. The drain is great jungle sustain, and can perhaps be used in a well-positioned gank, but in teamfights it's rarely usable. In-fight sustain WOULD be a point for Battle Mage, but considering he's so extremely fragile and that his drain is so unreliable in a teamfight scenario I DON'T think he should be considered a Battle Mage.\n***\nThat's my take on them, at least!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ZT Xperimentor","date":"2016-06-10T07:51:39.388+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Am I the only one that found it strange they just bisected all the previously established classes, instead of actually trying to categorize them properly?","replies":[{"poster":"Solideus","date":"2016-06-10T09:31:18.978+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Could you elaborate what you mean?","replies":[{"poster":"ZT Xperimentor","date":"2016-06-10T17:29:14.061+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They more or less took every class, and split them in half (except mages & marksmen); using a ratio of damage vs utility types. \nhttp://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/gameplay/dev-blog-classes-subclasses \n\n~\nBasically dividing each class based on; do they perform offensively or defensively, and how well?\nTanks; defenders like braum, and playmakers like leona.\n\nFighters; immobile like darius, or mobile like xinzhao.\n\nAssassins; kill one target like zed, or kill teams like yasou.\n\nMages; split into 3 based on their range & rate of damage (burst, artillery, and battle), rather simple.\n\nSupports; like the tanks, protectors such as janna, verses disruptive like zyra.\n\nMarksmen; the lazy undivided class, here's one that should've been obvious though; auto-attack reliant such as vayne & sivir, and ability casters like corki & lucian.\n~\n\nThe way they tried to oversimplify it by cutting down the middle appears as a lack of forethought.

Seriously, how often do you see a vayne get kills using only condem, or corki mow down teams with only autoattacks? \nThat's why riot was separating the classes into subclasses in the first place wasn't it?
