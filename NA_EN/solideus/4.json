This is partly due to the core of Noxian society being built on a rather aggressive meritocracy, so it's about what you can do or what you have. It's not about your name or your background.

While Jarvan earned her respect during his misterious journey after his capture at the hand of Noxus (i suppose that is still canon) she just followed him out of loyalty. Shyvana always suffered the fact that she is a mixed blood, refused by the dragon kind and feared (and i suppose even respected in some certain degree) by humans for her ferocity. She has always been an interesting character on that point of view. It was also stated that Shyvana hates the fact she can't socialize with humans as easily as others could do, if you read LoLWiki you would know Shyvana envies people like Nidalee, capable of being both wild and human without any socializing problem. She's an outsider in Demacia, and though respected and feared she knows she will never be able to be able to feels like a proper human being like the rest of Demacians.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"OuttaControl56","date":"2015-06-21T04:50:38.523+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Who the hell would close a door on a Du Couteaus foot though....

There could be barbarian-decent families or districts with a distinct sub-culture within Noxus. Other \"ethnicities\" would be even more interesting; how would descendants of Demacian defectors live in Noxus, and what would their flavor of sub-culture be like? There's lots of possibilities for descendants from various other nations.
