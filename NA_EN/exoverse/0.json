But, could there be a competitive feel to it? The generally game play of it is already good, but what if people don&#039;t like to play ranked on Summoner&#039;s Rift? Ranked on ARAM would make less people troll in ARAM. We all had that one guy on our team that has a good champion for ARAM like a {{champion:3}}  or {{champion:30}} . Then they just afk and make you lose. Since everyone knows that its just an ARAM, nobody reports them and they receive no punishment. Adding ranked would make people a lot more serious about it, and we can finally play 5 games straight on ARAM without someone trolling.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-10-24T03:07:15.081+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Loooooooolnope.\n\nThis would set a whole new level for idiocy in league. The sort of garbage players that infest aram already, can you see them in a competitive environment? Not to mention the games are mostly luck-based (that siad, S6 ranked is basically luck-based too, but that is not what riot intended).\n\nYou play ranked on summoner's rift? If so, you should know people troll, ragequit and afk about 10 times more in ranked than normals.","replies":[{"poster":"Exoverse","date":"2016-10-24T03:24:05.766+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ranked on summoner's rift is more or less the same thing. I realize that there a people who troll either way. They will keep making new accounts and keep getting banned. Ranked is just a word added to replace normal. People play ranked over let's say draft pick, because they want the status. More or less the same for my idea of ranked ARAM. It's just a status thing, and a new game mode that would make climbing a multi path thing.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Yooba","date":"2016-10-24T02:54:03.215+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"You seem like the kind of guy who flames in ARAM.\n\n\"OMG WHY REROLL GALIO WE NEEDED A TANK RETARD\"\n\nPlayers like you make me sick.
