Despite this however during the game it was giving me trouble Azir when using attack move (and sometimes just normal AA&#039;s) would walk in the direction of the click after preforming one auto attack, making for some very hard to control movement. Like i said i don&#039;t necessarily know the trigger but i thought i should say something.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-03-14T17:17:09.164+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hiya! \n\nThis is a [known issue](http://status.leagueoflegends.com/#na) - \n\nAzir has been re-enabled after fixing a few critical issues. We're aware of a lingering bug where Azir can start automatically moving after issuing soldier attack commands. However, because movement is canceled by other inputs and Azir is a high-input champion, we feel it didn't warrant leaving Azir disabled. It'll be fixed next patch!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shope The Schmul","date":"2016-03-12T22:33:03.656+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i just posted a report about the same thing! this needs to get fixed! especially since he was just removed and patched because of another bug!","replies":[]}]}
