I will say that some of the forms have some voice processing, which means that if one line isn't done playing, another won't. It's basically the 'trail' of the VO finishing. Another example of this occurring would be with Reaper Soraka, where you can't spam her emotes, and if the 'tail' isn't done on one line of VO, another won't play, but she'll still do the animation.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-12-02T18:07:00.854+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This was adjusted from the original play rate (increased).

There is a bug which sometimes causes a form to simply not play any of its voice lines (except for the initial transformation and the R cast voice line). This happened to me with Dark form for several games in a row. Lux was quite chatty in Light, Nature, and Air forms, but the moment I switched to Dark form she went completely silent, except to yell \"FADE!\" when I cast my ult. On my 4th or 5th game in that form, the bug didn't activate, and she was speaking quite frequently for the rest of the game. I've also run into this problem with Storm form. I have yet to hear that form's voice lines. Nature, Air, Fire, and Magma forms work normally for me, and I haven't tried the rest yet.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Aethiala","date":"2016-12-01T06:56:12.912+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bummer man.","replies":[]}]}
