RIOT LIKES MONEY, WHAT ABOUT SKINS?**\r\n\r\n-\r\n\r\n**Yuumi** is just the perfect sloth, floating around hanging from her little branch, doing no sudden or forceful moves, just throwing her spells.\r\n\r\n**Gnar** on his small form could be a sloth, and a megatherium (huge and badass prehistoric sloth) on his mega form.\r\n\r\n**Ivern**, a really cool sloth, slightly shortening his legs and making his arms longer, it would follow the theme of peace and chill very nicely.\r\n\r\n**Nunu**, sort of following the same theme as Gnar, Nunu would be a tiny sloth hanging from the megatherium that replaces Willump\r\n\r\n\r\n-\r\n\r\nI'd certainly buy all of the above, and I don't even spend money on league, ever. I'm pretty sure there's many more sloth lovers in LoL community who would greatly appreciate them too.","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-08-10T04:17:41.445+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"A sloth champ has already been released.

This jungle is said to be the nesting spot of one of the infamous sins - Sloth. There was a boy who lived in this village, a young boy. He would not pull his part for his village, for his people. He was a young well watcher. Tasked with keeping the village safe from infesting fire bugs from the nearby jungle, he would need to put out small palm sized fires around the village, before they spread. Usually, this boy would leave his duties up to the other children; Instead, he would traverse the outskirts of the jungle, searching for treasures. Sloth watched the boy through the souls of the trees, as he would stomp on the very life that fueled himself. The boy was a tad wicked, mistreating the environment and the animals within. He would take the very soil he tread on for granted, as if he did not understand that the plants could feel his tugs and twists. He would stray further and further into the jungle, each day, ignoring his well watching duties. There was one day, where Sloth decided he had enough of this boy; Sending a large swarm of fire bugs towards the village. The boy had ventured far enough into the jungle, where he could not hear the chaos ensue, let alone smell or see the smoke. This smoke began to attract more fire bugs, pushing the smoke deeper into the jungle, grabbing the boy's attention. He rushed back towards the village, hoping for something other than oblivion. Perhaps a large banquet is being prepared on the ceremonial fire pits? He thinks to himself. As he breaks through the tree line into the field clearing, he sees the village burning to a crumble. Figures he knew as his friends and family run before him, struggling to get the fire off of them. He can't breathe as he takes in his surroundings, and attempts to rush forward but passes out in the grass before him. After a few hours, he awakens... It's sundown. A single trail of smoke gradually climbs to the heavens. An owl coo's as he looks around. The gaping jungle maw stands over him, Sloth's eyes glowing through the branches. The boy begins to hyperventilate, crawling backwards towards his rubbled village. Two large tendrils emerge from the jungle towards the boy, holding him in place. He screams for a moment, as Sloth peers into him. A voice bellows out of the jungle towards the boy, \"You are going to pass, boy.\" Sloth states, seeing his heart slow before the boy notices. He begins to cry, clutching his chest, feeling his life force bleed out of him. \"I didn't mean to... I jus-... I didn't want that stupid job!\" The boy screams, throwing a nearby branch into the jungle. Sloth's eyes do not break contact with the boy, as the branch seemingly dissapears. \"It doesn't matter what you meant to do, child. I do not believe that you meant to do anything, this day, boy. You are never... Doing anything.\" Sloth taunts. \"But for that, your people suffered at your negligence.\" The boy calms down for a moment, lost in thought. He looks towards the village... \"How do I... Save them?\" He asks Sloth. Sloth peers at him once more for a moment, more vines emerging from the jungle. The vines are covered in strange leaves. \"Eat the leaves boy, and you will be healed. Your lungs will vent the smoke from them.\" Sloth says, motioning towards his tendril. The boy hesitates once more, but runs towards the tendril after looking at the burned down village once more. He begins to eat the leaves, taken back by the earthy flavors. As he continues to eat the leaves, his lungs begin to feel much better, and the leaves begin to actually taste great to him. He loses his restraint as he begins plucking each leave off of Sloth's tendrils. Sloth stares at him again, his tendril receding into the jungle as the boy finishes the last of the leaves. He wipes his mouth, \"What are those?\" Sloth pauses for a moment, \"Eucalyptus. They have spiritual healing powers through me.\" The boy begins to feel woozy, his stomach rumbling. He looks towards Sloth, \"What's happening to me?\" His hand begins to split in pain. Sloth does not answer, as he watches the boy step back a way. The boy screams as his fingers meld together into large, long sloth-like claws and his face condenses. The boy passes out as his metamorphoses takes hold. He awakens again the next morning, his head feeling woozy. He hears birds, and sees them chirping around him; He notices he is laying on a large branch, suspended above the ground. He's in a tree.. He goes to yell but out comes an unfamiliar sound... He examines his arms and body as he moves, noticing he is no longer human. He quickly drops towards the ground, exiting the large tree, and finds a puddle with his reflection... He moves over the reflection slowly, revealing that he has become an extension of Sloth, the sin. He looks around, a small sloth tear pooling from his eye, only to be met with the gaze of the Sloth Sin once more. He meets his gaze at the middle, staring into one another. Sloth delivers his will into the once, boy, demanding rectification. Sloth wanders deeper into the jungle, farther than he ever had been before to search for a toxic negligence, consuming humans. He must put a stop to those who destroy and neglect life under them. _\n\n\nJungle Rumble\nPassive:\nWhenever Sloth is in the jungle and bushes, he does increased damage to enemies. He may also click on walls and climb up them, moving on the jungle walls away from melee attacks.\n\nKnock Some Sense\nQ: Activate:\nSloth will punch in a target direction, dealing physical damage to all enemy units it hits. Enemy champions hit by this begin to bleed over time for physical damage. Sloth's auto's reduce this cool down by 1 second.\n\nSloth Wrath\nW: Passive:\nSloth cannot benefit from attack speed. He caps at 1%. Bonus attack speed will convert into AD.\nActivate:\nSloth will launch both of this arms in a target direction, dealing physical damage to all enemy minions it passes through. He will latch onto an enemy champion if it hits, and may reactivate this to pull himself to them.\n\nNutrients\nE: Activate:\nSloth will begin to eat eucalyptus over time, healing him for his max missing health, increased if he is in the jungle or bushes. This will cleanse him of any debuffs as well after 1.25 seconds of eating.\n\nTake To the Trees\nR: Activate:\nSloth will launch himself into the tree canopy, removing him from combat. He may reactivate this to drop down to the ground in a target location, dealing physical damage to enemy champions he lands on.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zeńith","date":"2019-08-10T23:27:56.630+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"really cool ideas. i like the gnar or nunu concepts the most.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Alex Luu","date":"2019-08-10T21:51:10.899+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"sloth skin ivern can be a thing tbh","replies":[]},{"poster":"FURRY V2","date":"2019-08-10T05:49:11.150+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"####**_~~Here is a Sloth champion concept for you~~_**\n\n**_*~~[Passive] Lifesaver lazyness~~*_**\nSloth starts the game with the movement speed of 1.
