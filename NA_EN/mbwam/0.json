Upon reinstalling and havin the client load and clicking the Launch button, my old friend the 'Whoops, something broke' window appeared again. Repeat (2x). I then opened the window and clicked the '?' in the TR corner and ran the repair. It took about 15 mins and scanned like 2700 files but when it made the sound that it had finished and I clicked launch, my old friend came back yet again.\r\n\r\nLost for words at this point. Any other courses of action?\r\n\r\n(to clarify: beginning this whole process, I could log on and just couldn't queue for a game.

The problem started after my client restarted to download the patch. It restarted and opened fine, just when it started downloading the patch it crashed. After the crash every time I reopened the client, this message would appear:\n\n\"We have restored this installation to an older version of League of Legends. Now we'll try to patch it up to the latest version.\"\n\nSo, I logged in just fine but I couldn't queue for any games (the client was not updating, the play button was simply grayed out). I ran the repair tool several times with same result, tried opening the client through the admin file, run as administrator, and now the game instantly crashes when I open it.\nI can't figure this out.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-06-14T20:15:52.676+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you still getting the older version error even after using the repair tool to reinstall?  You've started off with some solid steps, but it's super important to go through every step of the [permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) guide.  It's very likely that some setting on your OS is blocking your game files from updating, but that should fix you up.","replies":[{"poster":"Bologna squirts","date":"2017-06-14T20:21:20.323+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes I am still receiving the same error message. I opened C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends and found the file titled \"LeagueClient\". I deleted this and reopened LoL by clicking lol.launcher. This so far has seemed to do the trick as the client finally opened without instantly crashing or displaying the previous message stated above. Currently, the game appears to downloading again. This could be a possible fix.\n\nI would like to thank you Porocles for responding and I hope other players experiencing similar difficulties can use this as a solution.\n\n\n\nUPDATE***: This fixed my issue.","replies":[{"poster":"Halpdesk","date":"2017-06-15T04:51:59.969+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had an identical issue and this solution also fixed it for me.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-06-14T16:56:17.668+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"'Whoops, something broke' sounds like a very uninformative and recently new error message.  -.-  Your issue sounds like something with your OS (or an overzealous antivirus) is blocking your game files from being read or prepping updates.
