All of the hoodies for Europe were received in the warehouse earlier this week and shipped out. You should have received a shipping notification in EU and your hoodies are on the way. The hoodies for all of North America are checking into the warehouse in the morning and will begin shipping immediately, we estimate that by Wednesday or Thursday they will all have also shipped (they can get about 2000 per day out the door starting tomorrow). Thank you again for your patience and we will post a final update when NA has completed shipping.\"\n\nI recommend keeping an eye on the facebook page for the final update once all hoodies have shipped, but it's looking like good news so far! Let me know if you have any other questions. ^.^","replies":[{"poster":"Morick Yori SCOC","date":"2016-12-08T05:56:01.175+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is good and all but are we going to get any compensation or just even a heartfelt apology for making every person who ordered one of these wait 2 whole months past when they were due to ship.{{sticker:zombie-nunu-tears}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"lil dini","date":"2016-12-06T01:15:21.835+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wasn't aware there was a Facebook page!
