In the case of the perma ban we were playing a game together where we both did poorly in bot (not trolling and not even feeding for that matter) So we were getting flamed by our jungle hardcore saying that we&#039;re trolling and inting or should I say (YOU F***ING TROLLS) so we both tried to get him to calm down but he had just kept going and going we both just said to kys and he revived a perma ban from just one sentence, or acronym, while a angry flamer gets off scot-free.\r\n\r\nHis name is Blue Balls Shaco btw and he also got a ban for both him and i saying kys to our party member and our other teammates reported him. We aren&#039;t actually toxic just constant flaming is quite annoying and is hard not to respond to.\r\n\r\nSide note if someone sarcastically says something about the mute button I will kill a whale cause we both do use it after a bit.","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2018-03-28T02:48:12.674+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Telling another player to kill themselves is one of Riot's strictest zero-tolerance policies, and, while someone flaming you is frustrating, telling them to end their life is *not* an appropriate or acceptable response.\n\nWhich the punishment is aggressively tuned, a permanent ban for this likely means there was previous punishment history, as it normally earns an immediate 14-day ban.
