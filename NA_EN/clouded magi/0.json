After all this time she&#039;s finally stable again, and you guys are like halving the heal AND simultaneously nerf the mana gain?   Don&#039;t punish good cass players for getting a lot of stacks, instead here&#039;s an idea:\r\n\r\n\r\nRemove the slow when she misses her ult stun!\r\n\r\nBam, suddenly she can&#039;t just force an engage even when shes behind, and the good cass players are now separated from the bad!  It&#039;s not even a large heal anyway, there&#039;s absolutely no reason to nerf it.  I really, really hope some riot ppl consider this.","replies":[{"poster":"Leu07","date":"2015-05-20T00:50:59.069+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think it was an overnerf, she kind of needed a little tweak, but they gutted her mana sustain in half and ALSO they nerfed her passive spell vamp ratio from 0.1 to 0.06, they shouldn't go so hard.
