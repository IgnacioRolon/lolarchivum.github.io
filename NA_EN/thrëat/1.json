The games before that I was going vs D4/D3 with some D2s. The games before that for my plat team mates they were going against plat 2-3s. This is a full tier difference. The queue time was only around 7 minutes so I don't know why the window opened up so much that it allowed for such an imbalanced game.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Thrëat","date":"2016-08-03T19:25:37.208+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"GG team lost.
