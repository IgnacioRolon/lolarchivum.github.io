I will suddenly be unable to move, use abilities, ping my latency, etc but I will still be able to see everything that is happening around me with 0 lag and utilize the chat. These micro disconnects sometimes prompt the \"attempting to reconnect\" window but not  always. I'd say  it only prompts it 20% of the time. They last anywhere from 20 seconds to a full minute.\r\n\r\nI checked if anything was open in the background that could be causing it and I don't see anything out of the norm. I checked my ping via command prompt and I was not having any packet loss issues. My ping will stay in the low 60s the entire time and remain in the low 60s after without any spikes. I tried doing a client repair and computer/router/modem restarts it has not helped. Sometimes my girlfriend will be playing on her computer next to me and while I'm having issues she is unaffected.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-07T21:52:19.748+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You might be having a local issue within your own network that's cutting you off from reaching or holding on to our game servers.  A client repair would not really help with solving connection issues, but restarting your router was a good step.  Go through each step of the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to troubleshoot and rule out any possibilities in your network environment.  That should do the trick, but let me know if you run into issues.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LocTesMunster","date":"2017-02-07T20:40:39.665+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is happening To me as well.
