This has never happened to me before its not like a shitty computer problem i run at like 200 fps it randomly started happening any suggestions?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-06-13T17:58:49.202+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What Eanruig said!  You might have close [close client during game](https://i.gyazo.com/a39e12ca76e54359342203c476a0e9c1.png) enabled.  It's ended to reduce pc stress for a better in-game experience, so it may take a bit for the client to restart and get you to post-game.  Disabling the option should fix this!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Eanruig","date":"2017-06-13T05:01:18.860+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In the options menu on the first \"tab\" there should be a check box to \"close client during games\". something like that, make sure it's un-checked and it will keep the client open/minimized in the background. Post-game stats and lobby _should _load within a reasonable time.","replies":[]}]}
