Then when we go to load in i get a black screen and nothing happens. i mean i can leave it until the game is done and it is still black. works like this in every game mode custom included.\n\nIf any one can help me with the second issue that would be great or if you can help me get ahold of riot so i can talk to them.","replies":[{"poster":"RiotBok","date":"2016-04-05T00:37:13.820+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The support site login issue should hopefully be fixed as of ~1 hr ago so let me know if you still have troubles with logging in.\n\nAs to the black screen in champ select, I'd say that it seems like a connection issue.  You're able to connect to our platform, but something seems to be preventing the connection to our game servers.   Go ahead and try the steps in our [Connection Troubleshooting](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide and let me know how that works for you!","replies":[]},{"poster":"A Housewife","date":"2016-04-04T23:08:31.586+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been having the same problems with the black screen then an ''Error'' \nI just played against bots to check if i would have that same issue, since i kept having it yesterday every time i wanted to play a match, i had no issues. Then i decided to play Draft Mode since i wasn't having issues, but to my surprise.. that dumb black screen.  I just want to play Soraka!! I've been having this issue since Aurelion Sol came out. I really hope i don't get banned for this, i can't connect to my match. \n\nI've seen a lot of posts on this, so i hope Riot/Someone figures out a way to fix The Black Screen Of Death.
