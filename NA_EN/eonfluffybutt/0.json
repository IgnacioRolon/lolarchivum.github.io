This sucks but its just a minor bug.  Please fix if possible Q~Q ","replies":[{"poster":"ChimeiTekinaNasu","date":"2015-02-18T20:19:35.209+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually, no. Clicking it like that isn't how it works. lol. There's a sweet spot. Just click once beside your green dot and you'll be able to change your status. By \"clicking a million times and then it lets you, then doesn't\", I'm guessing you're moving your cursor around and clicking in that one spot then moving your cursor away. Is what I'm guessing you're doing.","replies":[{"poster":"EonFluffyButt","date":"2015-02-18T20:44:45.017+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ChimeiTekinaNasu,realm=NA,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=7ng0akv1,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-02-18T20:19:35.209+0000)\n>\n> Actually, no.
