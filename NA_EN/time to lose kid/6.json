Got nerfed for being a good lane bully. Now he is just a mediocre laner who falls off. Dead weight 90% of the time.\n\n#4\n{{champion:75}} \nBe useless. Sit top and get stacks because &quot;muh late game&quot;. Decides to group after 45 minutes only to realize the 1000 stacks he acquired doesn&#039;t mean shit if he gets CC&#039;d.\n\n#3\n{{champion:429}} \nterrible ADC who is only good if you use scripts.\n\n#2\n{{champion:427}} \nInferior to nunu in every single way. u really gotta be awful for nunu to outclass you.\n\n#1\n{{champion:238}} \nuseless champion. goes mid while being the antithesis of a mid laner. Lacks utility, AoE, waveclear. AD champion so your team is essentially mega fucked if you don't build around your special snowflake zed main. Falls off after about 10 minutes into the game. Exhaust and Zhonyas invalidate him. Trash.","replies":[]}
