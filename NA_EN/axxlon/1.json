Other emotions that trigger this response include fear, excitement and anxiety. The adrenal glands flood the body with stress hormones, such as adrenaline and cortisol.\n\nThe brain shunts blood away from the gut and towards the muscles, in preparation for physical exertion. Heart rate, blood pressure and respiration increase, the body temperature rises and the skin perspires. The mind is sharpened and focused.\n(FIGHT OR AFK FOR A FREE LEAVER BUSTER)\nMany people express their anger in inappropriate and harmful ways, including:\nAnger explosions – some people have very little control over their anger and tend to explode in rages. Raging anger may lead to physical abuse or violence. A person who doesn’t control their temper can isolate themselves from family and friends. Some people who fly into rages have low self-esteem, and use their anger as a way to manipulate others and feel powerful.\nAnger repression – some people consider that anger is an inappropriate or ‘bad’ emotion, and choose to suppress it. However, bottled anger often turns into depression and anxiety. Some people vent their bottled anger at innocent parties, such as children or pets.\n(STARTING TO SEE SOMETHING ABOUT MANY OR EVERYONE)\n\nSuggestions on how to express your anger in healthy ways include:\nIf you feel out of control, walk away from the situation temporarily, until you cool down.\nRecognise and accept the emotion as normal and part of life.\nTry to pinpoint the exact reasons why you feel angry.\nOnce you have identified the problem, consider coming up with different strategies on how to remedy the situation.\nDo something physical, such as going for a run or playing sport.\n(DO SOMETHING PHYSICAL SUCH AS GOING FOR A RUN OR PLAYING A SPORT AND GET A LEAVER BUSTER FOR GOING AFK IN YOUR RANKED GAME BECAUSE YOUR TEAM IS A BUNCH OF ASSHOLES)\n\nThe way you typically express anger may take some time to modify. Suggestions include:\nKeep a diary of your anger outbursts, to try and understand how and why you get mad.\nConsider assertiveness training, or learning about techniques of conflict resolution.\nLearn relaxation techniques, such as meditation or yoga.\nSee a counsellor or psychologist if you still feel angry about events that occurred in your past.\nExercise regularly.\n(LEARN RELAXATION TECHNIQUES DID ANYONE FORGET THIS IS A VIDEO GAME?)\n\nPeople who are stressed are more likely to experience anger. Numerous worldwide studies have documented that regular exercise can improve mood and reduce stress levels. This may be because physical exertion burns up stress chemicals, and it also boosts production of mood-regulating neurotransmitters in the brain, including endorphins and catecholamines.\n(YOU DON'T KNOW THE PERSON BEHIND THE KEYBOARD, DON'T SAY YOU FUCKED THEIR MOM)\n\nExpressing anger appropriately is a learned behaviour. Suggestions on helping your child to deal with strong feelings include:\nLead by example.\nLet them know that anger is natural and should be expressed appropriately.\nTreat your child’s feelings with respect.\nTeach practical problem-solving skills.\nEncourage open and honest communication in the home.\nAllow them to express their anger in appropriate ways.\nExplain the difference between aggression and anger.\nPunish aggression or violence, but not appropriately expressed anger.\nTeach your child different ways of calming and soothing themselves.\n(BY CHILDREN THIS MEANS LEAGUE PLAYERS)\n\nWhere to get help\nYour doctor\nCounsellor\n(MUTE THE SON OF A BITCH PUTTING YOU ON TILT AND REPORT HIM)\n\nThe long-term physical effects of uncontrolled anger include increased anxiety, high blood pressure and headache.\nAnger is a positive and useful emotion, if it is expressed appropriately.\nLong-term strategies for anger management include regular exercise, learning relaxation techniques and counselling.\n(GET OFF LEAGUE AND COOK SOME DINNER)\n\nHope you guys got a laugh out of this one\nTHE (quotes) are from me :D\n\nSource Information\n(https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/healthyliving/anger-how-it-affects-people)","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Walking Faces","date":"2015-11-04T02:30:08.258+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":24,"body":"I don't care if they perform worse after I tell them they've fucked up.
