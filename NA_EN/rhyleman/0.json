So I got leaver busters(which i guess i deserved) but i got ino a game finally after a 30 minute q. then i locked in and pulled up steam to play another game while i waited. someone dodged however the client didn't alert me, i am now sitting here in another 20 minute q still having not played a game. if there is any way i can get one leaver removed(since i have already waited out the twenty minutes) ide apreciate it if that could happen","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-12T01:27:57.910+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Whelp, that really does suck that you ended up with an LPQ for missing that queue.
