One of them (being last game) decided to play this build with 3 other ap champs on our team which is the main reason we lost. I don't understand why people play this build especially in ranked. There is nothing great about this except for:\r\n1. Late Game Burst from Dragon form E\r\n2. Extra mage (if there isn't enough ap on your team)\r\n\r\nShe's basically useless until she has her ultimate, and even then she only has her E as her main form of damage. W doesn't scale that hard off of ap, and her Q is more for an AD build. Yet people play this, expecting to win even though they are at a disadvantage for a good portion of the game. What is the main cause of people wanting to play such a build that leaves your team in a 4v5 scenario until late game???","replies":[]}
