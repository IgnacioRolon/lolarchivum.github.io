(I'm currently writing this up from a separate account) Every time I get one, I change my password. A couple times, I have found my passwords don't actually work, and I end up swapping the password again and recovering the account with my email. I have never shared my account info with anyone and I don't even leave the computer accessible with league logged in.  Recently I added a credit card to the account for convenience for a couple of purchases, was too lazy to punch in the information twice for 2 separate charges of RP.  Saw the account was hacked and they made off with a couple hundred bucks of RP, but the problem is they used the money to purchase a transfer to another region, as when I try to log in, I get the message \"Your account is currently in the process of transferring, please try again in a few minutes.\" When I look up the account and have friends check it, they are still able to see it in NA, so I guess the transfer hasn't gone through. I submitted a ticket, and was hoping to get some attention to the transfer aspect - Riot's FAQ sends me a link for account recovery, but I already have the account recovered with an even more secure password. I was really looking forward to using this time to play on my main account in ranked, as I have a limited amount of time off from work to play. Hoping any rioters can add some clarity to this issue. Thanks in advance.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-28T23:27:51.330+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Since we're both pretty certain that account was compromised, your best bet is to go ahead and use that [**account recovery form**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=72416). Those account agents will be able to make sure your account is still safe as well as help reverse any fraudulent purchases as well.","replies":[{"poster":"ßlack Lake","date":"2017-05-29T06:31:57.515+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"My account was hacked then send to the Russian sever I used the account recovery form, I got my account back but it stayed in that region, when I reported back that my account was still in that region the account agents said that I need to put RP in my account to move my account back.\n\nP.S : I cant paid in that sever IDK why.\n\nThis account I'm using is my EUW account that account has the same name and was in EUNE","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-02T01:09:13.847+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've got your old ticket pulled up right now, and I'm not entirely sure why the agent you spoke with said that.
