If you walk into a bush as fizz your eyeballs pop out and look really disturbing i don&#039;t know if this is intentional but it has remained in the game for ever. I feel like i&#039;m the only one to notice this and i hope that it isn&#039;t intentional cause i will feel dumb.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2017-09-14T17:30:25.340+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi GrandmaJenkins! \n\nThis one's a bit tricky. His model does do some weird things when in the brush. It's not best case scenario, and you aren't dumb. :P This is a larger scale issue with the brush tech itself not playing nice with a lot of champions and skins. It's something that we're aware of, but it's an issue that would require an entire overhaul of the tech, and that isn't something we have bandwidth for at the moment. \n\n{{sticker:sg-syndra}}","replies":[{"poster":"GrandmaJenkins","date":"2018-02-13T08:11:39.645+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ay i forgot about this post but thanks for the  feedback i finally got an answer :D {{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Reletr","date":"2017-09-14T21:01:17.436+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah this brush bug has existed for a while, at the very least since Camille was released, you could see the cylinders that protrude during her hookshot in the brush without using hookshot","replies":[]}]}]}
