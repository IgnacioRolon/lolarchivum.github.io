When people that just try to give the advice for lets say a rookie mistake and you just to just explain a simple thing to them and you get called all the terms, &quot;flaming&quot; &quot;bm&quot; or just simply &quot;reported&quot; other then the additional &quot;I&#039;m muting you&quot;...and what all these seems to do is just drag down the people trying every day to get out of the elo hell lol. But then is the justice system really justice? For a premade they could tali up the reports like a monopoly affect and just get you suspended if not banned when people have spent hundreds if not thousands of dollars on there account? Just curious on the outlook of this because I hate going into a match not wanting to speak to anyone.","replies":[{"poster":"Alpha Samsuni","date":"2016-10-02T19:21:34.161+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Difference between \"I don't think you should build IE, does it work?\" and \"OMG YOU NOOB WHY ARE YOU BUILDING IE BUILD LAST WHISPER INSTEAD\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2016-10-02T15:41:51.359+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First of all, you cant \"tali up the reports like a monopoly affect\", as you so eloquently put it, because nine reports against you in one game is the same as one report in one game. It just treats the game as being reported.\n\nSecond, I give people advice all of the time and don't get backlash, its just in how you word it. Think of how you would like things to be said to you if you were in already nervous because you are doing poorly in the game. If you don't feel confident in your ability to do that, which is fair, just don't give advice. You can talk to people without giving them advice.","replies":[]}]}
