Most of the time it's an upgrade in the visuals and over all feel of the champ.

Cannot be balanced.\n\n{{champion:3}}  Super OP, and had literally everything in his kit from shields, cc, tankyness, and fucking raw damage. Consistently nerfed every patch since and still an amazingly strong tank support. Success imo cause he's my favorite champ, but cannot be balanced as is.\n\n{{champion:84}} True invisibility? Nope. Broken.
