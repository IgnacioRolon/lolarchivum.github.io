I just got permanently banned for using the N word in chat. I made a statement about the use of bannable words in the chat system, despite the term being flagged by Riot as a bannable word. I essentially got perma banned for saying:\r\n\r\n&quot;Hey, we can banned for saying X but Riot still lets us use X in chat. Isn&#039;t that weird?&quot;\r\n\r\nI can understand if I got a suspension or a warning to not use these terms in chat, but perma banning me over this seems pretty extreme. It&#039;s honestly really depressing because I&#039;ve changed my entire behaviour since my last suspension. I&#039;ve turned from being a toxic, malicious individual with no regard of other players feelings and time to actually being one of those guys who says things like &quot;It&#039;s all good guys, we can get them next time.&quot;\r\n\r\nRiot, look at my chat logs. Other then light teasing or jests, I haven&#039;t provoked or inflicted any kind of emotional pain or trauma onto anyone in this game. I&#039;ve changed completely as a League of Legends player. I didn&#039;t even intend to push my boundaries or anything with that statement. I was just making an observation and I really didn&#039;t know or think it would end in a permanent suspension to point out a bit of irony in the game chat. I&#039;m really sorry if I still caused trauma or emotional suffering with that statement. I had no intention of being toxic, nor did I have any intention of dehumanizing anyone.","replies":[{"poster":"Shamose","date":"2018-09-02T21:44:34.196+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"_Yes let me say this bannable word a bunch of times.
