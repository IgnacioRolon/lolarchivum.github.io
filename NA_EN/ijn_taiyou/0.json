As if they get some kind of superiority for saying it. \"There's no proof so it can't be real, right?\" Unicorns are yet undiscovered but that doesn't mean unicorns don't exist, or have never existed, or never will exist. \n\nThese are the people that will snarf Christians for saying, \"I will pray for you\" or \"God bless you\". What's important isn't the words but the meaning. You're just making whatever religion you happen to follow look intolerant, which is not what I'd consider good PR.\n\nEDIT: Inb4 thread gets deleted for \"attacking individuals or groups outside accepted social norms\".
