The last time it happened was in December over winter break. Unfortunately, I don't have the match history page for this but I wanted to back up UPJedi on this since the few times I have had it happen have been extremely demoralizing for my entire team.\n\n Edit: I went back and found the match through op.gg. It occurred on December 27th in the game where my team was {{champion:23}} {{champion:113}} {{champion:111}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:99}} vs. the enemy team of {{champion:8}} {{champion:161}} {{champion:121}} {{champion:236}} {{champion:78}} . Our Tryndamere didn't connect until about 6 minutes into the game as can be seen from his 0 EXP and 0 CS up to that point. When 3 minutes hit, we tried to /remake but were given the dialogue that we couldn't unless a member of our team was dc'd which Trynd was. It even said \"Reconnected\" when he did finally come back at about the 6 minute mark. At the time of writing, this was about 20 days ago. Here's my op.gg page if you'd like to find the match by scrolling down a ways there, sorry I am not sure how to find the official match history page when it is not in my most recent. http://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=Blakiepug","replies":[]}]}]}
