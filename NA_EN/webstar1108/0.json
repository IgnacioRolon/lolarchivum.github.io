The fact that they are exhibiting a behavior that is pissing people off means that RIOT has not done a good enough job. My opinion is RIOT is very inconsistent in discipline.\n\nJust yesterday there was a poster who was whining about being suspended 14 days for hate speech. There was also a representative from RIOT who came on and explained to him how ugly that type of behavior is and why he got 14 days. I posted that RIOT don't understand what zero tolerance is and all they are doing by suspending instead of banning is encouraging that type of behavior because people will see that and think it's ok, I won't get banned.\n\nThat whole thread has since been deleted.\n\nThere is no reason whatsoever to use hate speech and if it happens in my game then yes I lose my mind on the person because RIOT is inconsistent in their discipline for everything.","replies":[{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2018-06-12T20:37:50.684+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"See, your problem with the system is actually about the clarity of the system. \n\nThe system works, but does a horrible job in telling people that it's working, so people ASSUME they can get away with certain stuff, cos they saw people do / say horrible stuff and think the toxics got away with it. \n\n\n\n\nSo when you say the system doesn't work, it should really be corrected to add in the \"feeling\" that it doesn't work and feels inconsistent.

There was really no reason to post that part. It is your opinion. Not everyone thinks like you do. Different people might, heaven forbid, think winning the game is fun as well and IMO those people that don&#x27;t approach anything they do in life in a positive light, IE. succeeding or in this case winning are basically useless in my world.

Do You?\n\nI do understand, and no I do not think you are wrong to play a game to win, but if you are going to be constantly angry at losing a team based game when you can only contribute so much towards your team's effectiveness I think your time could be better used elsewhere (probably in a pve setting), though obviously it is your choice to queue up or not (nor would I really tell people not to play just because they might get tilted, they have to make that choice for themselves).\n\nAgain it is not apathy to not take an extreme reaction to something not going your way. You can be invested in a game without freaking out every time a team mate dies, or getting angry every single time you lose. Apathy isn't a lack of negative reactions, it is a lack of interest in general. You can play a game to win, and enjoy winning. Nothing about that says you have to lash out at people when you lose.\n\nYes, I do understand people have natural reactions, but people can also improve themselves and work past those reactions. At no point did I say it doesn't sting to lose a game, it can feel bad when a single miss play costs you your nexus, but I do my best to keep that feeling from becoming anger, or lashing out at my team mates.\n\nAll that being said I do not appreciate the seemingly condescending tone, or the putting words in my mouth (even if they are stated as assumptions on your part).","replies":[{"poster":"dragfins1213","date":"2018-06-12T19:01:31.682+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Kordeleski,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=mHWgd1gN,comment-id=00000000000200000000,timestamp=2018-06-12T18:46:56.337+0000)\n>\n> I do understand, and no I do not think you are wrong to play a game to win, but if you are going to be constantly angry at losing a team based game when you can only contribute so much towards your team&#x27;s effectiveness I think your time could be better used elsewhere (probably in a pve setting), though obviously it is your choice to queue up or not (nor would I really tell people not to play just because they might get tilted, they have to make that choice for themselves).\n> \n> Again it is not apathy to not take an extreme reaction to something not going your way.

Apathy literally means to not care. If there is any aspect of what a person is doing at any given time then apathy exists. I have no patience for the slightest bit of apathy when it involves something that I am doing and I am going to let that person know about it. It don't have to be mean or \"toxic\" but they will know it. If they want to argue about it then that's on them and they will be reported for negative attitude but I will call them out for not giving a shit on my time if they chose to que up and bring that horseshit attitude into my games.","replies":[{"poster":"CloudedLogic","date":"2018-06-12T20:45:31.013+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=dragfins1213,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=mHWgd1gN,comment-id=000000000002000000000000,timestamp=2018-06-12T19:01:31.682+0000)\n>\n> You don&#x27;t understand at all.

I simply understand that the out come of a game (a single match especially) doesn't have a very lasting impact on my life, I also understand that \"calling someone out\" doesn't really change anything in the slightest. This also isn't apathy, this is me understanding my position and working with what I have.\n\nNone of this, however, means I won't be bothered the next time I get into an match and one of the players on my team says \"Sorry got to go to work,\" 10 minutes into the match. That being said I am not going to flame him for starting a match when he knew he likely wouldn't have the time to finish it. I'll play the 4v5, and then if I feel he deserves to be reported I will do so and move on.\n\nWhat I am getting at is me choosing not to let people get me down isn't apathy, at best it is exercising self control.\n\nYou can care about winning, and not get angry about losing. They aren't mutually exclusive emotions tied to opposite outcomes at all times. To not care either way would be apathy (which if you truly feel apathetic about the game I don't know why you would play). To use a word, say \"You don't understand at all,\" then to try and describe your intention behind using it, just feels like I am being attacked for not being telepathic or something and isn't really helpful in trying to express your sentiments.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Saibbo","date":"2018-06-12T22:48:50.438+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"My chat :\n\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"Colgate Gator","date":"2018-06-12T17:20:12.404+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"It still amazes me how people can go nuclear enough in order to get banned, to be honest.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HalcyonDweller","date":"2018-06-12T16:19:24.437+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Solid advice! +1","replies":[]},{"poster":"La Belle Sauvage","date":"2018-06-14T19:05:13.312+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"3 full season,not one ban or warning.
