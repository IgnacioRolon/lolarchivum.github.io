That's making me feel like the main issue lies somewhere completely different than with your hardware. Since you're never seeing any champions load in the match lobby, there's a chance that your network isn't able to actually grab any of that data from our servers. \n\nLet's go through [**these steps**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) first the make sure adjusting some of those network settings doesn't do the trick. Hit me back if you're still having problems, and make sure to test those changes in a custom game.\n\nAlso! You can absolutely post images here, you just need to link the image url including the .png/.jpg and it'll show up here.","replies":[{"poster":"alex01763","date":"2017-05-09T15:03:04.498+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i ran the hextech repair tool and made a simple batch file to release and renew ip before launching league. that seems to have fixed the network problem but the framerate issue is still there. and i still cant figure out how to upload pics... do i have to upload it to imgur or something first?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-11T21:28:12.077+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yup!
