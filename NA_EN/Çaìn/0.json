I submitted a ticket on this account as well regarding my ticket on my other account on the Russian server. It has been 4 days since I submitted my first ticket and I still haven't got an answer so I'm wondering how long it will take for riot to answer my submission? Its really frustrating not even getting an answer or anything at all in as long as 4 days. usually I get answer within 24 hours from riot support but now it just feels like my ticket has been thrown down the trash bin. please respond and help me.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-26T15:20:49.043+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It usually doesn't take too long, but our volume has increased quite a bit for most teams over the last few days.
