It happens almost as soon as I enter the loading screen, and I stay stuck at about ~30%. I've tried the file checker before launching the League client, and it did not detect anything.\r\n\r\nWhen in the loading screen, I cannot:\r\n*  Alt-Tab out  \r\n* Ctrl-Alt-Delete\r\n* Ctrl-Shift-Esc\r\n\r\nTo clarify, all of my background tasks continue running, I just cannot leave the loading screen, and I cannot load into the game. \r\n\r\nOriginally, my laptop was having connectivity issues and then broke, leaving me with Low Priority Queue for a few games.\r\n\r\nSo I bought a new laptop. That's when the loading screen started freezing, and it was also when 6.13 was released. I have since then returned that laptop and got a different, brand-new one, which is also having the same problem now. I'd love to get back to playing the game, so i would greatly appreciate any help that can be given me. \r\n\r\nThank you all! :^)","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-07-09T18:13:27.387+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since you've consistently seen issues across multiple devices, it's very likely the core cause is a poor connection to the servers.
