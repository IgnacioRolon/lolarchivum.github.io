I recently upgraded to a i5 4690k (not overclocked) and a gtx 1070 with the rest of my components staying the same, with 8 gb ddr3. \r\n\r\nEvery few seconds for a few seconds the game will slow down dramatically. It is still responsive, is not Internet lag related, and no components are maxing out or coming close. \r\n\r\nSometimes nervous the end of the slow motion period I'll jump to where I guess I should be, sometimes not,  and then it'll go away for a few seconds and then return. \r\n\r\nA few older posts suggested resetting the pc clock speed which I did through the command prompt and it did not fix.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-03-17T04:25:40.785+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like what you're describing is what a lot of players call \"rubberbanding\". This is referring to anytime the champions appear to slow down, jump back to where they should be, or teleport around. This can happen when your network's connection to our game servers is unstable, causing your champion to move around awkwardly as it tries to catch up to the game. Let's go through our [Connection Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to see if we can narrow down the main issue.\n\nLet me know if that helps out!","replies":[]}]}
