It is already one of the best escape tool for your support in the game and removes the weakness of many hard initiation support with no gap closer/escape(this is extremely powerful as those supports are balanced around having to reply on flash). The ult should be used only for escape and a gap closer rather than a long duration aoe cc itself(knock up is also the strongest form of cc in game).\nAnother problem of kalista is that her rend damage isnt capped against monsters. Afaik every execution move against monsters have a damage cap(I guess you can argue it is fair because she has to build up stacks). Also, 20% max hp every 6 second seems pretty high compared to say zed or j4's passives.\n\nFor reksai, I think her knock up radius is fine. She has to get into melee range to use it and it is her only cc, with a reasonably long cd that cant be reduced by cdr(tho its hitbox does seem to be a bit bigger than the visual effect). I heard more people complain about her tremor sense. It is a really big counter to champions like rengar, evelynn, shaco and also very useful for checking baron/ambush. Maybe you can nerf its range a little bit.\n\nEdit: I forgot to talk about the mana cost of kalista's rend. Her e has a mechanic similar to twitch's e. Their cd's and base damages are similar but Kalista's has a higher ratio(it also scales off total ad not bonus ad), has a slow, the damage is uncapped, and can be reset, but rend's mana cost is only 40 while contaminate has a mana cost of 90 at max rank. Kalista can basically spams it. Sometimes you can even see people just use her e to last hit one minion. If you want to take away some of her power, maybe we can increase her e mana cost by a little bit.","replies":[{"poster":"Atsuki Kimidori","date":"2015-06-26T15:27:06.214+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Ult are suppose to be the strongest skill of a character kit, while other adc have ult that deal ton of damage or game changing in some way, you want kalista ult to be just a free escape that many other characters have as their basic skill? be reasonable please, there are nothing wrong with a high cd skill to have some of those power.","replies":[{"poster":"Saintshing","date":"2015-06-26T16:48:36.091+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Knock up is the strongest form of cc in the game(not affected by tenacity, cant be qss'ed like suppress). Kalista is the only champion in the game with a 2s knock up. Even malphite ult is just a 1.5s knockup. Not only that, it also amplifies the initiation power of your support. Annie already has one of the best engage in the game but she relies on her flash. With kalista, her engage range is increased by 1200 and she can do it every 60s.\n\nIn addition, it is one of the most powerful escape ability, it is a reposition skill and it renders your support untargettable for FOUR SECONDS. Zhonya has a 90s cd(kal ult has 60s cd at max rank) but it only makes you untargettable for 2.5s and you can't move(same for liss ult). Kalista+thresh is basically ungankable.

He said \"I heard more people complain about her tremor sense\"\n\nHe's not beeing salty in any way, so calm down pal. Sounds more like Rek'sai is your beloved champion going hard against anybody who dares to criticise her.\n\nLearn to accept criticism.\n\nB2T:\nI personally think Rek'sai's knockup is just as good as it is. The radius is completely ok. Maybe you can incrase the time on knocking them up again. But everything else is ok.\nTBH I don't see Rek'sai often in my games. \nShe has slightly above average winrates (53-55% on average) and her banrate is not a problem as well beeing at around 28-30%\nI don't see the proble with her or playing against her.\nShe was way more annoying when she was that durable and had assassin'ish dmg when she came out.\n\nThere are other champions to tone down and who should have a higher priority to balance.\nGragas for example. Nearly 100% Ban or pick rate.\nEkko (hopefully the nerfs hit him a bit and he'll tone down now)\netc. etc.\n\n\nFor Kalista? \nI guess people finally got used to her and her harder mechanics.\nI think there isn't much counterplay to her. People who train with her and adapted to her passive have an easy time to avoid skillshots and be rather safe. It's hard to count with the stacks she is doing to you (maybe add a debuff where the stacks are counted which you recieve from her rend) so you can actually kinda predict her dmg output more in a fight. \nPeople who don't play her often underestimate her output at the end and of her W passive.\nAnd yes Q+R poke with some ad hurts allot. She is \"too\" safe to pull that off.\nGraves for example has to be point blank to do that amount of dmg.\nMaybe change some of that stuff?\nHer ult...Well...idk about that. Heavily depends on the support. The knockup itself isn't that bad. The followup ult's and stuns from a Leona/Nautilus for example are devastating. 90 sec CD rank 1 is ok, 100 Mana is pretty normal, it doesn't hurt people initially since the dmg is 0 and there is kinda no restiction if you bind your support since you are most likely in his range. Bonuspoints if you are in Teamspeak with that guy.\nMaybe change it to a lower knockback instead of a long knockup?

Her enemies need to have one (or preferably more) of the following to be able to do anything against her:\n\n - Targeted or instant-AoE CC (root or stronger)\n - Heavy burst damage to delete her before she can react\n - Multiple gap-closers (or a single gap-closer combined with burst and/or cc)\n - Ranged non-skillshot damage at a longer range than her autoattack range (marksman autoattacks count here)\n\nAny champion who doesn't have one of those has extremely few options to deal with her.  They will lose any fight unless an ally with the above can either lock down Kalista for long enough for them to interact with her, or burst her down quickly enough to take her out of the fight.\n\nThis means that she tends to win or lose games based entirely on which champions the enemy team have picked.\nWhile that tends to make her roughly \"balanced\" in terms of win rate, it directly contradicts Riot's own stated [Design Values](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/features/dev-blog-design-values-league-legends):\n\n> League isn’t won at champion select and no phase of the game should be decided before a team steps up to fight.\n\n.\n\n> A fight loses its excitement if the first punch wins – it's what you can do after that adds depth and complexity. ***We try to prevent hard counters*** and abilities with no room for reaction, as no game should be over without a real show of skill.\n\nJudging by the many threads that have been made about her here on the boards, most people seem to agree that her passive hopping mechanic is simply not fun to play against if you happen to be one of the (large) subset of champions that she excels against.\n\n----\n\nOutside of the gameplay and balance issues, her theme is a vengeance spirit that works together with her soul-bonded invoker to hunt down and punish her target.  All of her other abilities fit towards that purpose, but her passive doesn't.\nA vengeance demon that hops around like a rabbit, and mostly uses those hops to rain down death while running away (and being uncatchable) doesn't fit that theme at all.\n\nHer kit has enough unique abilities in other places that she would still be an interesting and usable champion even without her current passive.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LaceUp23","date":"2015-07-05T19:13:28.632+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are their any plans for Fiddles?
