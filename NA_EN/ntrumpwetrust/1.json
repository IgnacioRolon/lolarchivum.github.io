This makes absolutely no sense. The problem was, people weren't getting items, or the items they were getting were bad compared to what other people were getting, and some people were getting 4-5 items on the first 3 pve rounds. The change on pbe does almost nothing to remedy this problem. You should be getting GUARANTEED items from pve rounds, all this change did was substitute getting nothing with getting 1-3 gold or exp (which can really fuck you over). \r\n\r\nAnd for the love of god, put a cap on the maximum amount of items someone can get off pve rounds.","replies":[{"poster":"Bregan","date":"2019-07-14T16:11:40.322+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"they only change we needed was for every player to get the same COUNT of items. the rng of WHAT item you get is fine, but things just need to be the same COUNT. maybe one match every player gets 4 items from the minion rounds. maybe another match everybody only gets 1. it doesnt matter, as long as everyone gets the same COUNT from each pve round.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Toadwart","date":"2019-07-14T08:39:49.663+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Correct.\nIts next to no change at all. You can still go through npc rounds and receive no items, just like you did before. Its a placebo to shut people up.\n\nGold or xp...they do not have the power curve of items. You can buy XP with gold right now, you can earn more gold right now by managing your gold and collecting interest. Neither of those 2 things are equal to the power boost you get from items and neither of them can be traded for items.","replies":[{"poster":"2Charmnot2Charm","date":"2019-07-14T11:40:51.882+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Getting XP is even worse because it forces you to level up sooner than you wanted incase you would like to stay at X level for higher chances of rolling what you want.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Meritas","date":"2019-07-15T01:53:37.584+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wait what, you can get random increases in XP? {{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}} {{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}}","replies":[{"poster":"Porglit","date":"2019-07-15T21:16:01.212+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meritas,realm=EUW,application-id=RaE1aOE7,discussion-id=AMYyhEXK,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2019-07-15T01:53:37.584+0000)\n>\n> Wait what, you can get random increases in XP? {{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}} {{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}}\n\nYeah...
