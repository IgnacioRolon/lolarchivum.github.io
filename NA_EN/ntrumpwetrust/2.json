Unique BE Chromas for each champion's Classic.\n - One of the issues I currently have with buying Chromas with BE right now is that the current set of Chromas are either for Champions I don't play, or Champions' skins I don't own. While getting a new Chroma for every champion would take time, having at least 1 unique Chroma for each Champion that could be bought without RP from any player who owns them would be nice incentive.\n2. Expressive Unique Emotes\n - Personally I'm in the camp who thinks that Emotes should just have a BE cost in general (Or a price re-evaluation) , but the current two emotes seem like they're just BE dumps, rather than being desirable icons for me to express myself in a match. Having solid and expressive BE exclusive emotes, and importantly having emotes that aren't just BE dumps, would be nice.\n3. Seasonal BE Skin.\n - Simply put, something similar to how HexCrafting has their own unique skins, only this seasonal skin could be used as the big BE dump item. Have 1 per year with a high BE cost to reward habitual players, and we've got something to look forward to at seasons' end.\n4. Rotating BE skin Sales\n - If we have a BE store only open at very specific times of year, you could have a rotating sale going on, spread out depending on the time the store stays up, and how frequently the store comes back. Change the sale every few days or each week while the BE emporium is in town and you can keep people checking up on what the store has to offer.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ahferroin7","date":"2017-11-09T00:07:01.309+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Um, content that's likely to appeal to a wide group of people perhaps?

That leaves me with A gemstone, which would bring me up to 5. Yes, I have earned 4 gemstones from quite a few chests. And you need 10 for just one of the hextech skins...so it's a pointless investment as well for that price. Soooo, I guess I'm just gonna sit on my 60k and slowly lose enough currency to not be able to buy new champs with BE through mystery shards at some point in the future...which, I guess, is what they want to happen.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lollapalooza","date":"2017-11-09T00:09:34.016+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly I feel like I got fucked, I spent RP on rune pages, I got blue essence in return and I'm just like \"cool so now I just do what I did before and wait for a new champion\"\n\nyou guys do realize there are 5 roles in this game, Warwick fills one of them, it's cool that we get the option to buy a \"meme\" skin and an old one at that, but the whole \"more options to spend on\" didn't satisfy the community, just the 2% who main that champion, and the 0.5% who still find the urf meme le funny xD.\n \nnot mad I know you guys can't offer every champion's skins for blue essence, I can suggest that you'll consider these things:\n\n1.Make a random skin shard store option just like the champion shard.\n\n2.Make personal store have at-least one random skin cost blue essence.\n\n3.give me money back le xd\n\nP.s: I could put the stupid ass cannon minion icon and not give a shit for eternity, I'm pretty edgy like that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"OnanThaMan","date":"2017-11-08T21:48:31.102+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea, pretty saddened by it, though all chromas were gonna be blue essence for a while.
