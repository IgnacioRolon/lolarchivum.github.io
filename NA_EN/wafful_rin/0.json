HeyItzSteve is correct, account-related issues is best solved by contacting my colleagues through the [Support Site](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). With that said--in my experience--the majority of \"my account has been reduced to Summoner Level 1 (or lower than it was before)\" cases tend to be because someone has multiple League of Legends accounts and has logged into the secondary hasn't-been-touched-in-a-long-while account.\n\nYou can quickly check if this is the case by using the Forgot Username page here: https://recovery.riotgames.com/en/forgot-username?region=NA1\n\nYou'll receive an email with the accounts currently associated with your email address.
