However i fear a decent chunk of the community will be turned off by a full page of paragraphs. I don&#039;t believe this is because of lack of interest, rather the incentive to put the time in reading when  an individual could just play and not care about the lore. \r\n\r\nI truly believe the lore for this game is great and has near limitless potential, I for one get excited to play certain champions because I know what kind of person they are. For example, Poppies old lore made me want to play and do well with this young yordle who&#039;s been through so much. Background Story gives champions there soul if you will, to compliment there personalities. I love playing Olaf and Darius, knowing I&#039;m playing as these warriors who crave battle with there bloodthirsty and cocky attitudes. Other champions like Jarvan IV and Galio, I get excited playing these champions because there lore expressed there personalities given us players someone to root for. \r\n\r\nGoing back to Spirit Guard Udyr, I remember feeling so hyped and excited seeing the comic, interacting with it, and &quot;ultimately&quot; buying the skin because I really wanted to be a badass like Udyr was in his comic. This is just food for thought and to express my feelings towards these champions we&#039;ve grown so close to. I also like the idea of  further exploring each individuals player&#039;s feelings towards there favorite champions, and how Riot as well as the community can work together to think of ideas to express our devotion to the characters we love the most. I&#039;m personal not worries how Riot will hype up new champions, skins, etc because they rarely disappoint. Thank you Riot Games and thank you everyone who&#039;s made it this far in my post.\r\n\r\nEnding questions:\r\n1. In what ways can Riot hype up new content such as champions, skins, etc?\r\n2. How can Riot provide ways to help players personalize and or help them express there love for there champions other than masteries?\r\n\r\nPut your answers and comments below, constructive criticism is always welcomed, and please be respectful to your fellow players.

Those definitely made me feel more connected to the champion than a written story could. (Except for Skarner. Skarner's was on point.)\n\nAnyways, I'd love to see something along the lines of a lore-based community-interactive event, like Bilgewater. That way players who don't normally look into lore can build a connection with their champs, and perhaps influence the outcome of their stories through play.","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2016-05-24T20:23:15.340+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Pheonixwish,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=KXLrdENE,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-05-24T16:56:46.924+0000)\n>\n> They&#x27;ve definitely turned to comics many times, for the Poppy and Taric rework as well as Ekko.\n\nLinks to the comics in question, for reference :)\n\nEkko: Chronobreak - http://na.leagueoflegends.com/us/site/ekko-comic/\n\nPoppy: A Hero's Calling - http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/site/poppy-comic/\n\nTaric: The Ascent - http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/site/taric-comic/\n\n(The Ekko one was my fave, personally).","replies":[{"poster":"patmax17","date":"2016-05-24T21:02:40.061+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"does this count, too? :P\n\nhttp://promo.leagueoflegends.com/en/spirit-guard-udyr/comic/\n\n(hope this opens a comic, can't load it atm)","replies":[]}]}]}]}
