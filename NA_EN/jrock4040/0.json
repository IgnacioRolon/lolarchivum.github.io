One game I was frustrated and my Jungler just kept making it worse. Insulting me and feeding my lane. \r\nI got really toxic and flamed him. Next time I tried to play a game I got perma banned. That was the first time I had ever been toxic on that acc at all. Really? A perma ban after ONE game? Riot have mercy please. I personally think it should be two or three games before perma ban, I&#039;m ok with a chat ban after 1 game even, idc I just want the acc back.","replies":[{"poster":"Treeofwar","date":"2016-07-29T21:55:25.941+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"have you ever gotten a chat ban or a 14 day ban on that account","replies":[{"poster":"jrock4040","date":"2016-07-29T21:58:05.444+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, first ever ban of any sort on that account.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Tantram","date":"2016-07-29T22:04:43.656+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":1,"body":"You did have a 14-day ban recently, which you may not remember.
