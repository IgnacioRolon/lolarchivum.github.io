Rather than having conversations that occur in chronological order like discussions SHOULD happen, you have discussions that become sprawling messes that bloat out other discussions. It becomes drastically more difficult to follow conversations unless they happen to be the most popular conversation in the topic.\n\nI stayed on the LoL forums because I enjoy the community here, and because I enjoy forum interactions overall - even after I've mostly stopped playing.\n\nThere is no variation of this upvote centric nested topic style that I will like, so I guess my time being a part of this fine community is limited.\n\nThank you Riot for creating a good community - but no thanks for thinking Reddit's popularity comes from it's format being usable. There's a reason every other site that has tried to use it has failed shortly after... Reddit's success lies in when it came about and the communities that have built within it, not in it's format.\n\nEdited on August 30 2014: I didn't realize this thread would remain popular enough to get views a year after I created it, so I want to point out that when I made this thread 'chronological view' wasn't an option since nearly every comment in the past while has been about it ;)","replies":[{"poster":"Krylhos","date":"2013-09-18T05:32:09.370+0000","up_votes":74,"down_votes":161,"body":"I appreciate your perspective, and would like to get to the root of why conversations are hard to follow, and why you feel like direct replies are a \"sprawling mess\".\n\nI would however, like to challenge the idea that conversations occur in chronological order, particularly when more than one person is involved. A discussion is often a topic which spurs further conversations from different people who chose to react at different times, and also only choose to react to either the original post, or a response to that post. \n\nIn a typical chronological format, one would have to read every single reply to determine which ones were directed at you, or which ones were directed at which response you made. Quotes can only get you so far when trying to carry a decent conversation. One of our goals is to make effective use of your time, and nested replies allow for that kind of conversation to be more easily facilitated and followed.","replies":[{"poster":"Eleshakai","date":"2013-09-18T05:44:35.187+0000","up_votes":120,"down_votes":8,"body":"A fair point, and it is valid. But there are a few things that make it extremely awkward. \n\nFirst and foremost... unless the thread you're following is either the most recent one started or the most popular it's impossible to view it in any reasonable way. In a traditional forum you just have to remember what page you were last at and you can instantly jump to it. In a reddit you have to either go to your profile(assuming you actually posted in it and are not just following it without posting) or you have to scroll and hope it's still in the same place as it was before. And if a different thread has come up that has a lot of likes, that thread is displaced and you end up reading every thread anyways in the hopes of finding the one you were following.\n\nSecondly... having posts and comments constantly changing positions leads to a TON of re-reading. This leads to a ton of wasted time. Time that leads to me being less able to follow discussions.\n\nThirdly... as someone who, when he follows a thread, FOLLOWS the thread, this type of format makes that extremely difficult. I don't care what other people think is the most popular post... I want to read everyone's opinions. With a traditional forum, I'll remember which page I've read up to... and just read from there. With a reddit style, no matter how I sort it, I have to re-read basically every post since even if you sort it by 'most recent' it only sorts it by when the subconversation started as opposed to being able to just straight up read from where I last left off.\n\nFourthly... As someone who likes to be involved in the conversation on the whole... a forum allows me to reply to multiple people at once. Meaning I only need to make one post. Since most forums have post limitations, this is important. It sucks seeing 3-4 things you want to reply to, and in stead of being able to just do one big reply quoting people respectively... you have to make one short post, wait x minutes, make another short post, wait x minutes, etc. \n\nThere are more reasons why I hate the format... but it's almost 1 AM and my mind is starting to lag.","replies":[{"poster":"AWildCard","date":"2013-09-18T07:42:35.898+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":49,"body":"As some one that dosent really like to reply to much, I rather enjoy an up vote type system.

It's about participating in a thread, FINDING topics of discussion, getting your topic noticed, and following threads.\n\nParticipating in threads is more difficult since you can only reply to one point at a time, and you have to create tons of separate posts that artificially clutter the thread and also force you to run into the post timer issue far more frequently.\n\nFinding discussions is far more difficult since you are only exposed to the most popular topics unless you explicitly choose to view new threads in which case ALL you see are new threads.

This relates to the last post. If people are forced to choose between seeing either new or popular topics, the vast majority of the time they're going to choose popular.

If I'm following a forum thread, and when I leave for work they're at page 12 all I need to do is remember that I was at page 12. When I get home, I start at page 12 and read however many new posts there are. In the Reddit style, I have to basically reread the ENTIRE discussion because even if I choose 'recent' it will just show me the recent threads, not recent replies to old threads. This means if I want to truly follow a thread, I have to literally read over the entire thing again to look for new posts in each and every thread that exists within the discussion. And since there are no pages, that means I could potentially have an IE window that is so long it starts to lag.\n\nOnce again, it isn't about the first time you read a thread.

You're only exposed to the very small number who are ACTIVELY SEEKING new topics at that exact moment.\n\nEssentially in stead of having a brief window where everyone on the forum could potentially have their eye alight on your forum subject and be interested... you only have a very small number of people - and these people would have seen it anyways.\n\nAs to the 'giving people choice'... they already have choice: They can click in your thread, or they can ignore it. If they were forced to read your thread regardless, then you might have a point about that... but I see threads I'm not interested in all the time... does it negatively affect my experience? No. I just scroll down to the next on the list. Oddly, these threads that don't interest me? Usually the most popular threads.\n\nYou say \"Most relevant to you\" - I find that kind of offensive. The system doesn't have any special algorithm to determine interest to a specific person. It merely tracks three things: public opinion, current activity, and how recent a thread was posted.

Quoting people is no longer as straight forward and quotes aren't as specific to their source as in vBulletin.\n\nThere's also a huge damage to the sense of community because vBulletin threads are much more conductive to conversation and human speech flow than Reddit style posts, which seem to be more a barrage of information fighting for the top positions.\n\nI also have to take points off for Riot's community boards overall, because there is a sense of indignation that comes with having no avatar, no signature, and no distinguishing values to your profile.

Champion rework discussions are the most obvious example - which does not make them the ONLY example, mind, just the easiest one to explain.\n\nIn a discussion, the flow of discussion generally changes over time, and this is what makes champion rework threads such a great example. The conversation will start at point A - \"Hey guys. We're looking to rework this champion. Here are some details, give me your thoughts.\" Then everyone chips in with their thoughts, discuss different possibilities, what have you. Then the designer comes back and gives his feedback, responds to a couple of people, etc. While this \"phase\" of the conversation happens, a reddit style is probably just fine. However, in these rework threads, there is inevitably some bigger, more important red post that changes the flow or direction of discussion - if you look at the Skarner rework, this happens several times. The idea comes up to move the shield's secondary components off onto the E and the Q, and in the traditional forum style, the flow of conversation then changes. As far as discussion goes, posts from before this revelation are less relevant, and it's assumed that posts after this point are accounting for this change. In the old forums, the discussion has now evolved. However, in this reddit style... how does one even denote that the flow of conversation has changed? One red post doesn't work, because only people reading/responding to that specific post will know about it. It's also unclear how that post has affected other branches of discussion, if it's done so at all. The alternative is to add it to the original post as an edit, which is kind of fine for new branches, but it's unclear which branches were made after that edit; which ones are taking that into consideration and which aren't. It makes discussion foggy, and results in a lot of tangent branches that trail incredibly far off from the current focus of discussion. Now imagine there are five more iterations of this, each one massively changing the intended focus of discussion as the rework progresses.\n\nThe strength of the old discussion style is that the discussion is always laser-focused. Everyone is on the same page with the discussion, or at least not too far off - by the nature of that style of discussion, tangents die off, and the posters that contributed to them return to the main branch of conversation. In this example, every time a new \"big\" red post comes in, the discussion shifts - it's assumed that new posts take that change into consideration, and it's VERY CLEAR to the reader which posts come before and after those shifts. It results in a single thread of discussion, even if that single thread changes direction here or there.\n\nThe reddit style, on the other hand, results in a broad web of discussions spawned off the same topic (assuming posters care enough to keep clicking \"show more\" on the threads of that web). That's kind of fine for those taking part in the discussion in those threads (which eventually turn into tangents), but it's much harder for someone to jump in and find the flow of conversation, and harder to identify which post comes from which shift in flow. I think it's fine for short-lived discussion, but any long-form discussion gets diffused by this style.\n\n(I would just like to reiterate that while this is ESPECIALLY true for champion rework discussions, it is NOT the only case where this applies. Every long-term discussion evolves over time - it's just slightly less noticeable than the instant shifts followed by red posts.)\n\nEdit: I also dislike the comment about the \"signal to noise\" ratio. Aside from the most extreme (ie, bannable) cases, I abhor the idea of letting popular opinion decide what I would consider \"noise.\" How is anything aside from popular opinion supposed to be discovered in that environment? Blegh.\n\nEdit edit: It's also impossible for this format to \"preserve the same flow of conversation\" when the presentation is entirely different.","replies":[{"poster":"Stillhart","date":"2013-11-18T22:50:19.277+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"I agree with Sproctor on this (though I'm clicking reply on Pendragon for visibility).\"\n\nThis is a great example of one of the BAD things about the Reddit style \"discussions\".

The old forums were not that great with the way it was setup but I preferred it more because it made any conversation go from post 'A' to post 'Z' in a sense. This Reddit style forum makes it so you almost have to read the entire thread over again if you wish to follow the conversations.\n\nSomething else I do not really care for in many forums is the fact that there is essentially no quoting or it is does poorly. *Chan websites have a fairly useful way of quoting where you can specify the post number and if you hover over it, it shows the post. Even if multiple conversations are going on, you can follow them fairly easily so long as users use the function. The function works both ways as well, so if you are viewing the first post, you can hover over the link and it would display the reply and if you look at the reply, it would have a link you can hover over to read the first post. If it doesn't make much sense, you can look at a website like 4chan.org to get an idea of it.\n\nAnother function of several forums that I really like is the ability to, given you have read the thread before and there are new replies, 'jump' to the newest post in the thread. It makes it very simple to follow threads that are very popular or if you have a hard time remembering exactly what page you left off.\n\nI do like the ability to hide and show posts, makes it slightly easier to remember what posts you have read and to just hide them when you are done reading them.\n\nLast thing, I promise, I do not care for the upvote/downvote system because it generally just encourages users to follow a style of use like Reddit where members post merely for upvotes. The rating system, in my opinion, should not dictate a style of post that is prevalent on sites like Reddit. Instead, there should be a system that is more like 'This post helped me!' Everyone has a voice and the upvote/downvote system basically casts out unpopular ideas from a conversation that would otherwise benefit from it.\n\ntl;dr Hard to follow specific conversations. Implement system like 4chan to easily quote other posts without creating really long pages. Make a 'jump to' button to easily navigate to the newest post. Good job on the 'hide/show' post function. Karma whoring may become as prevalent on here as it is on Reddit and essentially is just a really bad choice when you wish to promote deep conversations.\n\n\nWeeeee!

You don't keep your forum moderators in check (they move anything and everything they feel like to the Dominion sub-forum and never bother going there to moderate for us), any posts Dominion players make on the main LoL Reddit have to be mass-upvoted by the community just for it to stand a snowballs chance in hell of fighting against SR-auto-downvoters, and to top it off this Reddit style doesn't even have a Sub-Community for the alternate game modes.\n\nIf this becomes the replacement all non-SR threads are just going to vanish into the ether under a hailstorm of GD-style downvotes and moderator 'because I feel like it' deletions.

Another discussion community notices it and starts talking in it, spiking discussion. Very rarely do posts get noticed initially without some outside attention because there's just such a small chance of anyone ever seeing it.\n\nThis, to me, is a huge downside because it reduces the opportunities for people to do exactly what you described above: KNOW if they're interested in a less popular topic.
