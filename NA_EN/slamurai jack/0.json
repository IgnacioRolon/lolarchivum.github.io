You need to have pretty high CDR to even get the E CD low enough to do it, and you can always just wait out the remaining .5 seconds or so of E and then use it.

The way to do it would be having both locket and ohmwrecker in your final build, but it's hard to justify prioritizing these over boots/cinderhulk/spirit visage / randuins / sunfire cape /...or even arguably a GA or dead man's plate or warmogs.

That leaves me with 35% CDR which feels sufficient while still giving enough early game power as to not be vulnerable and the defensive masteries scale really hard as the game goes on.","replies":[{"poster":"EndlessSorcerer","date":"2015-10-20T18:35:00.803+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can skip the 5% CDR in masteries without much issue, leaving you at 25%.\n\nI used to use 5/25/0 masteries before they made the alterations to the defensive mastery tree and I haven't really played Mundo since those changes (I've just had other people I wanted to play).\n\nHonestly, now that I think about it I would be tempted to use [0/30/0 masteries](http://www.mobafire.com/league-of-legends/mastery-tree-planner#&tree1=0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0&tree2=2-2-2-0-1-3-0-1-1-3-3-3-1-1-1-1-3-1-1&tree3=0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0&v=2) on Mundo again.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
