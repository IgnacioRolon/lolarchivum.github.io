Second, while Naut does have a lot of CC, Leona has a good 150 range on him (Naut's Q+R= 1955 and Leona's R+E= 2075) Making her ganks scarier. On top of that, Leona's ult has a much lower CD than Naut's, making her ganks even more scarier. As far as your \"real\" answer, Tahm was broken as fuck and just did what he wanted, he was also designed around his whole \"eat people\" theme and Riot didn't really have a role assigned to him. And Naut was primary made to be a jungler, but it just so happens that a ton of CC is good for bot lane too.\n\nThe only other role I can see Leona feasibly existing in, without having to change her too much, is top.
