When reading the patch notes it says that, \"Players on low-spec machines will see a dialog asking them if theyâ€™d like to enable low-spec mode\". How low is considered \"low-spec machines\"? also would there be a way to manually activate it?\n","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-12T23:18:42.069+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're near [minimum required specs ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752654-Minimum-and-Recommended-System-Requirements)then you could receive the notification.\n\nClick on the gears button on the top right, General, then toggle Low Spec Mode.  To reduce even more stress on your pc, you can also disable animation.  I hope that helps! \n\nhttp://image.prntscr.com/image/598e949fe2904c85b3220875cf13760f.png","replies":[{"poster":"Draconoth","date":"2017-01-13T00:16:19.709+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok thank you so much!","replies":[]}]}]}
