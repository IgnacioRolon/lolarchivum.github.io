If you report players who behave poorly, they will be investigated and punished as appropriate.\n\n>, am i not allowed to respond in kind to defend myself.\n\nNo, you are not allowed to \"respond in kind\".

Because I would call it a valid punishment if the only game given to you was that one.\n\nThat aside, don't ask people to report or say that you're reporting people. All it takes is a single report for someone's game to be reviewed by the system so you're just using the behavioral system to attack them in chat.\n\nReport them and move on.
