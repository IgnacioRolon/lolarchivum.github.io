It used to be 180 when good and 220 when bad. Even at 220 it was playable, but now it's 100ms higher and the game has become unplayable. My ping to the JP server is unchanged and I've got good speeds to everything else but NA lol. All of my friends are on NA so I'd really like to be able to play there. What can I do to fix my ping?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-29T18:00:29.383+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're playing from a pretty far physical distance, so you're generally going to have higher ping.
