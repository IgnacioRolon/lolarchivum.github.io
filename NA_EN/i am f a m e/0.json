Since a few patches i did noticed something that really annoys me. When i try to ping using ctrl+click (one of the 4 choises) it works really bad. If i try to do i normaly (normal speed )i end up using a wrong signal (ping) because it is liek i have 1000 mouse sensitivity and the cursor ends on the edge of the monitor. Everything works fine during the game but when i want to ping the cursor is going crazy. As far as i can see..after every patch it works well 1-2 days but then it goes back to the crazy sensitivity problem. If u cant understand my problem , just leave a comment bellow and i will post some screenshots too, maby it will halp.\r\nThank you for your time.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-02T19:52:48.826+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I haven't heard of any mouse sensitivity issues solely while using smart pings, so that's really weird.  Do you have any programs or mouse settings that somehow increase mouse speed while holding down ctrl?  Are you able to try another key or even mouse to help rule out possibilities?  Let me know!","replies":[{"poster":"Kappadar","date":"2017-07-14T02:35:42.668+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I also have the same problem. I do the Ctril + Click into drag and the sensitivity is insane and it even drags my camera sometimes...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jojo1124","date":"2017-07-07T17:09:01.599+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have had the same problem recently. I do not use ctrl + click, however. I use the V + drag and once the 4 pings appear my sensitivity skyrockets. I use Razer Synapse if that helps. What's weird is that when I tried swapping out for an ancient Logitech mouse, everything was fine. I really wouldn't like to have to switch devices  though.","replies":[]}]}]}
