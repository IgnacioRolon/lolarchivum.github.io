As the above people have said continuing to play and raising your mmr is the best way to stop having them on your team. If you are not a bot then that means that you have a statistically higher chance to not have a bot on your team since you take up a slot. That means that you have a higher chance to win and therefore should be able to rise easily.","replies":[]}]}
