Hell fucking yes I did. Before we start let me say I am sorry to everyone&#039;s game I was ruined everyone&#039;s day I have ruined and even worse to everyone that I have ever flamed. I know u probably don&#039;t even remember me but I&#039;m sorry, when I was younger I was rude had anger management issues and was extremely explosive, this resulted in the perma ban of my account of 3 years with over 15,000 hours played and around 600 or more dollars sunk into it. When I was permanent banned I was devestated and I turned my self around, I went to anger manament classes as well as read many books on anger management and haven&#039;t even touched the game in awhile. I spent a long time playing rugby focusing on school and learning to control that rage that&#039;s built up inside of me due to family issues with my father being a drug addicted and brother following his footsteps. After a year of training I feel like I have learned to control my anger and even learned how to diffuse arguments with my self as well as with others. I&#039;ve learned a lot of self control. Now I figured I was ready to come back as a reformed player and benefit the community and game that I once terriozied only to find out that perma bans are 100% indefinite and the experiment to allow players to reform was destroyed by people like the old me. So my question to you as the community that I once flamed but still loved, to the game that I once ruined but still was addicted to, do you think there should be a system in league where after a year or more u can come back and get your permanently  banned account resolved if you pass a certain reform sheet or maybe even something like where the next ban with negative activity results in an immediate perma ban as if your name is on a black list or something that can never be wiped? I feel like I deserve another chance but Maybe I&#039;m wrong maybe I&#039;m still scum but I think they should give players like me a chance to reform and be an asset to the community instead of someone who wants to hurt it thank you for your time have a great day","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2017-07-19T01:44:11.979+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do agree there could be some slight changes to the punishment tiers, but not revoking a permanent ban.

No. This was for removing permanent bans, meaning that 95% of the time it was the correct decision, and trying to reform them after that point is a futile effort.

I'm sure this was all a big experience and you took it to the best direction now. However your previous account was marked by many people as the source of their sadness.\n\nYou are not even allowed to have the same name as an account that have been permanent banned. Ever.\n\nI would see your old account as a mark of the past and the money and time you spend as the price you paid to get to this better experience.\n\nA friend advice would be to not try to reform to fix things up (getting your account back), as a lot of things in life we mess up and there is no fixing to that, but reforming because you want to fix yourself up and move on.\n\nBe grateful you only had to pay 600 to understand more yourself and help yourself with your case. Some people spend 20 years and 100.000 dollars on clínics and continue stuck in the dark and being banned from many other things different than league.\n\nThere is nothing good there to go back to and people feel more secure when everybody think this way.
