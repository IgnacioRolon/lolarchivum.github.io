I play a lot and had 2 or 3 in the last few weeks; usually 1 a week or so. It&#039;s typically obvious. Previously both sides agree upon what is happening and the game ends in a relative cordial fashion with everyone reporting the d-bag.... However, something dark and sinister has begun happening....\r\n\r\nApparently the new dank thing when the troll is on the enemy team is to tell anyone who requests you report the troll (however politely), that you are reporting them for verbal abusing the troll. Then proceed to argue that the troll isn&#039;t intent feeding at all and that they need to stop flaming them.\r\n\r\nOf course I&#039;ve not suffered any account penalties (No matter how mad I get, I make sure I don&#039;t swear at all) - but you want to talk about a real trigger... To anyone who does this, I hope you rot in hell.","replies":[{"poster":"Kallian","date":"2016-09-21T22:50:58.511+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"well... you _actually_ aren't allowed to ask people to report someone for you","replies":[{"poster":"LuvsChineseGrls","date":"2016-09-21T23:00:24.166+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes but come on... after the guy pulled ctrl + 4 for the 3rd time in mid lane and died, I think the normal response is, \"Sorry for your troll.\"\nMy point is this community has hit a new level of toxicity.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Please Hurt Me","date":"2016-09-21T23:05:32.135+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=WaterIsAwetsIut\n\nI just won a game feeding. <3","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-09-21T22:53:58.043+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because it is not allowed (and punishable) to ask other people to report someone. And typically, they are completely justified for reporting people who do that, because usually they are just a ragebaby that is flaming a teammate who is having a bad game.","replies":[{"poster":"LuvsChineseGrls","date":"2016-09-21T22:58:37.569+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Made it clear this wasn't someone having a bad game. Talking about someone running it down mid to die over and over... and yes I understand Riot's stupid logic that talking about punishment is punishable. Riot is also a Chinese company now, so that makes perfect sense.","replies":[]}]}]}
