A light breeze shook the tall grass around them. \r\nThey were standing on a gentle hill's side, in a shade cast upon them by a grove, only few steps above. It was late afternoon, so the shadows were long and they could easily hide, had anyone stumbled across them... Splashing of a nearby stream should easily drown out their voices.\r\nYasuo was still slightly put off, unsure why the Exile brought him here... He had a feeling, though, that whatever it was Riven wanted, he would soon be forced to unsheathe his blade.\r\nThe woman turned to him then, causing Yasuo to tense up a little... He instinctively wanted to reach for the sword, but forced himself not to.\r\n“Why is it you brought me here, Riven?”, he asked instead, slowly examining her face, trying to pay attention to her every movement, ready to defend himself at any moment... Then his eyes met hers... \r\nSuddenly, he felt a slight push... When did she manage to place her hands on his chest...?\r\nAnd why was his body's reaction to give in, rather than spring up and leap away?\r\nBefore he could answer himself, he found that he laid on his back and Riven knelt over him... She was blushing slightly... His every instinct was failing him. He didn't push her off... He didn't strike... He didn't move at all.\r\nRiven took her eyes off him, before smiling delicately...\r\n“I thought you were a famous warrior, yet you were toppled quite easily, Yasuo...”, she said after a moment of silence, turning her stare back at him. \r\nOnly then, the Unforgiven started to grasp what was happening. A smile entered his face, as he chuckled lightly.\r\n“Your name is equally praised, Riven”, Yasuo noted. “I feel no shame losing to someone of such skill!”\r\nRiven's laugh was much sweeter, than one would expect...\r\n“I have no need for honeyed words”, Riven lowered her upper body, placing her lips next to his ear.“Talk dirty to me”, she whispered.\r\nThis time, Yasuo knew exacly how to react.\r\n“_I want to rework Mordekaiser_”, he said immediately.","replies":[{"poster":"Hextech OwI","date":"2018-09-22T16:45:26.099+0000","up_votes":27,"down_votes":0,"body":"Get this out of my christian game","replies":[]},{"poster":"borrow","date":"2018-09-22T16:29:58.962+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":1,"body":"GO UP.
