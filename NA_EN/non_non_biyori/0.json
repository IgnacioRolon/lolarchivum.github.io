I had quite a lot and some of them were legendary and epic skins. Is there any way I can get anything back?  I'm so goddamn pissed... it really takes a while to earn all of that. Also, they played and trolled/inted in 2 ranked games. I'm not high elo or anything, but it's really frustrating because I was one win away from promos.\nIf nothing can be done, someone at least be here for me because it's a bit lonely with an empty friends list :/","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-07-06T21:53:11.497+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rest easy, we can help and certainly do our best to make reparations.
