Just Installed Windows 10 and read and tried multiple guides and fixes.","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well I just installed a clean new version of Windows 10 last night and installed league after that. I am able to see the patch notes and champion rotation information but the second I click \"Launch\" it just doesn't do anything the window closes and nothing happens. I updated my computer to make sure I had the latest drivers and everything but League will still not launch.  I searched the forums up and down trying multiple fixes and nothing has worked so far. I've changed compatibility settings, run it as admin, and other special property fixes yet no solution yet. Please help me solve this horrible issue.\r\n\r\nThanks so much\r\n**-Her Royal Majesty Queen Catherine de Medic**i","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Morgageddon","date":"2016-04-19T01:16:58.023+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heyo,\n\nSounds like you've got a program preventing League from running properly. Are you running an antivirus suite, such as Avast!? You may want to check and see if any of your Firewalls are setup properly to allow all processes of League through. Hopefully you've created a support ticket as well so we can look at your logs if need be?","replies":[{"poster":"QueenCatherine","date":"2016-06-18T02:46:45.659+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey,\n\n I just got on the forums again yesterday and I had resolved the issue with Microsoft. I am so sorry for the late reply but thank you for support advice.","replies":[]}]}]}
