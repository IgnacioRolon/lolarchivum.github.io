You report these photos just to see what&#039;ll happen, only to find out that somehow they&#039;re not in violation of policies.\r\n\r\nAn Eve cosplayer with **ONLY** body paint is acceptable on Facebook and Instagram, but Muay Thai Lee Sin is a violation of terms.\r\n\r\nLet&#039;s put some equality in our games. I&#039;m not saying go to Saint&#039;s Row levels of shenanigans, but male character models could use a little more attention to detail in the gaming industry.","replies":[]}
