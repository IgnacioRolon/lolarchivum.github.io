This is an issue we're aware of and deployed a fix that solved this for some players, but we're still looking into a permanent solution that works for everyone. For now, you should be able to work around this by exiting Fullscreen mode in the loading screen. You should be able to do this by hitting **ALT+ENTER** in the loading screen to enter a windowed mode.\n\nLet me know if this worked for you.","replies":[{"poster":"Radiant Wukong","date":"2017-02-01T23:57:37.364+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Didn't work, but I changed windowed mode from 0 to 1 in the file and it worked.","replies":[]}]}]}
