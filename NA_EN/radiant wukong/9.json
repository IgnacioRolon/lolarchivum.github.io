Though i don't like the Vel'Koz Support idea that much, but hey, it works, so be it.\nRakan mid is already a thing, and though rarely i see that, so far it's working pretty well.\nSo no, it's not reportable, and it's acceptable. They both still have their strength and weaknesses.\nI've seen Lulu ADC on ranked, with Blitz, and we got 1st turret in like 10 minutes (i was Vel'Koz support, of course at first i was concerned).\nSo just chill man and give it a chance from time to time. Don't judge a book by its cover.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mahou Chinchin","date":"2018-05-26T20:40:06.965+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"You should not be able to ban people for their picks.
