Then again it&#039;s only priced at 520 so that might be a part of the skin. Pls no hate if it has already been fixed, I&#039;m just trying to help out.{{champion:104}}","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2017-09-18T16:10:37.078+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Mama Spaghetti! \n\nI'm really sorry for the delay on this. I've had this bug sitting on my to-do list to follow up on. So, this was a lot easier to resolve than we thought! \n\nTurns out, this guy was just missing the VFX that base had. (Both guns have a gap in them, but with VFX, you don't notice it!) \n\nHere's what Hired Guns Graves looks like all touched up, along with a comparison of base Graves!\n\nhttps://imgur.com/lRa0Q37\n\nThis should be ready for live in 7.19. Thanks for the report! :)","replies":[{"poster":"The Equalizer","date":"2017-09-18T16:50:49.074+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm sorry to reply to you here, but there are a few Rumble bugs new to 7.18 that hits him pretty hard, such as not receiving the Danger Zone bonus damage sometimes while he has the orange bar and he can't fire his E at all while overheated. I'm just concerned that this will be live during worlds since Rumble is a competitive pick...","replies":[]}]}]}
