Maxing E means ganks can happen more often. Its also better for slowing pursuers.","replies":[{"poster":"Venowolf","date":"2017-12-18T19:29:50.867+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agree the E always go first. I am M7 Skarner , and he can go well both AD and AOp,,, Also I play all the iterations since the Perma slow Q to the high damage Q (Juggernaut) to this one (mini game passive). I really like him as a Vanguard tank not as Juggernaut. But as you said in a previous post he play more as a warden tank in tf and punish bad position. His passive motigates a lot of his potential so maybe that could be the issue with him. Is a pain pint need to be or create problem/tf in the Skarner´s shrine to unleash all the potential . IMO he needs a whole new passive and focus more on the Vanguard side without lost the hybrid fighter theme.\n\nPD: I always see you on my boy Skarner post. please share your thoughts with me, maybe we can put the giant purple Scorpion (Brackern race). I really miss my kind","replies":[{"poster":"Shahamut","date":"2017-12-18T19:44:43.146+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you dont mind me sharing: \n\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/LM6KvNAQ-skarner-rework-idea?\n\nThis is a thread I started and have put my thoughts in many of the replies there in.\n\nShort version:\n\nSkarner was (when he first made his appearance) advertised as a hybrid fighter. Back then, Fighter simply referred to melee damage dealers without much distinction. If you look at Skarner's kit as a whole, you can easily see it focuses very well around one thing: Fighting 1v1. He has/had :( high sustained damage through auto attacks and crystal slash. A low cooldown shield, a slow+stun, and a single target suppression.\n\nIn my opinion, if Skarner were made with his original concept in modern day, he would be a Slayer- Skirmisher. Perfect for jungle or top lane. He would be a strong ganker (in jungle or as the laner) with his single target lockdown and damage, a good split pusher, etc.","replies":[{"poster":"Venowolf","date":"2017-12-18T21:04:32.612+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nice I put some of my thoughts in your post.

I mean his OLD kit. He was the sticky tank that just would not let you go. He didn't do a lot of damage but once he got to you he never lost you. It even had decent AP ratio on his QER. His 2nd kit, which I thought was his best kit, actually gave him a passive. His stun was attached to his Q and required you to hit a player 3 times with skills before it could proc. This was a better set up than this current kit since you couldn't just immediately stun someone, you had to work for it. He was given scaling passive attack speed from both his Q and his W but his damage was still low, so that was the trade off. This 3rd kit, which is an abomination, needs to be reverted. Having a passive that only sits in specific areas of the map, which can be turned **off** is stupid. Imagine the outcry if Yasuo's crit could be turned off.\n\nHonestly he just needs to be reverted back to his 2nd kit. Tweak the attack speed bonus from Q and W and you have a fair champion once again. This actually forces people to play Skarner appropriately as opposed to his current ER>AA, which is 1 dimensional and bland.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shahamut","date":"2017-12-15T16:37:20.782+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its interesting to be sure, but I am not a fan of it:\n\nSkarner, for me, was the inescapable hunter.

(RIP dominion.)\n\nSkarner, just before the juggernaut changes, was in my mind exactly what he needed to be. He had ramping attack/movespeed on Q, sustained damage pattern cc (passive), A slow, and his ult, which had the option of having more damage via passive, or the ability to chain it with the inital stun. \n\nYou still had the kiting weakness, but good players where able to find a way around it. He scaled well as a 1v1 duelist, but still had a niche role as a secondary engage tank, or as a vangaurd (peeling tank) in bigger team fights. He was a pick fighter, and a pretty good and underrated one in my opinion.\n\nWhen juggernaut changes happened, he was way over tuned, E became his best max skill (Slow, Damage, Stun+burst damage, Passive stats for 1 second [attack/movespeed+ Mana regen], self cooldown reduction per stun proc.), and they nerfed him into a state of uselessness. Everything is on E now, and Q is just a poor scaling sheen proc.\n\nI don't like ideas that have Skarner burrowing, we already have Rek'Sai. As far as Lore goes, if Skarner was to have a burrowing skill, it would pretty much be to hide or sleep, not hunt.\n\nI had attempted a rework idea for him that tried to center his play around being \"charged with crystal energy\" which, for me, was kind of his unique take on resource if you took that route. Idea inspired by what was ORIGINALLY his bread and butter skill, Q: \"Skarner charges himself with Crystal Energy, empowering this ability...\"\n\nShort version: Passive is now Crystal Energy, Skarner's unique resource. Auto attacking and using Crystal Slash gather crystal energy. The more energy he has, the faster he moves/attacks.

Uses Crystal Energy to regen HP based on missing health. Passive: Exoskeleton: Skarner gains AR/MR based on his current crystal energy.\n\nE: Costs Crystal Energy to fire, no longer slows missile speed as it passes through targets.

Your version is more like Akali W plus Graves smoke screen.\n\nPre-Juggernaut Skarner (no numbers)\n\nPassive: Crystal Venom- Skarner's spells/abilities infect enemies with Crystal Venom for 5 seconds, stacking 3 times.

A short cooldown prevents recently stunned targets from receiving Crystal Venom.\n\nQ: As it is, but with base damage and scaling. Hitting targets with Q grants Skarner a stack of crystal energy, stacking up to 3 times. Each stack grants skarner bonus attack and movement speed. Continuing to hit more targets with Q refreshes the duration. All stacks fall off at once.\n\nW: Same, different scaling was all that changed.\n\nE: Didn't slow down as it passed through targets, dealt damage, slowed and applied a stack of crystal venom to all targets hit.  The real one point wonder.\n\nR: Same, except that it did bonus damage for every stack of crystal venom currently on the target, consuming the marks.
