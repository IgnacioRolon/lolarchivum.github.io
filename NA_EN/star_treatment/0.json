Twisted Fate is white according to all the splash art that riot created. I feel this is how riot created him. However when playing him in his default skin in game his skin tone looks quite dark, which is very strange considering in his splash art he looks very white. Let me just get this clear first im not being racist, like i have no problem with it, i am just wondering if its a glitch or if he actually is ment to have like a tan to him it just looked strange to me.\r\nThanks any response from riot or anyone who wants to comment would be much appreciated :) {{champion:4}}","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-07-28T15:59:54.891+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think they chose the skin tone to make it seem like the hat was casting shade on his face without having to program light particles (that could potentially slow the game down) or make it part of the texture (which would look bad when turning the character or looking at it too closely.\n\nIdk about the hands though, probably just didn't want him to have one skin tone somewhere and another somewhere else.","replies":[]}]}
