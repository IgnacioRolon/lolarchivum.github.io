Usually like once or twice a game; almost ALWAYS as soon as I get botlane to kill the first melee minions. I get this really fast flicker(not 1s), and then I wont notice again or get it again. Sometimes I might get it again in a game. and its pretty anoying to get this this in midle of fight.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-23T02:40:48.635+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Make sure you've got all the latest graphics drivers and DirectX updates. If those aren't helping, I'm curious if something deeper in your system could be messing with the graphics while you're playing League.","replies":[]}]}
