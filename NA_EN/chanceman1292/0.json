I love how he can be so curious, sinister, naive and boastful all at the same time. My particular favorite is how in some of Vel'koz's lines he takes a villainous pause (pausing for camera close up no doubt) before finishing his thought. \r\n\r\n*\"You may experience mild...incineration.\" \r\n\"High concentration test subjects...wonderful.\" *\r\n\r\nI have one request and its going to keep nagging at me if I don't say anything. \r\n\r\n**Is there a way to make Vel'koz recite one of his observations after killing an enemy with his ult?**I found it quite odd he wouldn't give the player insight into what he learns upon killing an enemy. This something that is played up in his lore and his VO. It just seems natural to me that killing an enemy with his ult would be a perfect time to add this character quirk. It could just be one of his attacking or movement lines really. Some that stand out...\r\n\r\n*\"Flailing appears to be a universal response.\"\r\n\"Human melting point remains... inconsistent.\"*\r\n\r\n\r\nOR HE could just have one line and that would be enough for me... \r\n\r\n***\"Thank you for your... contribution.\"***","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Tokkelossie","date":"2014-08-05T21:09:04.244+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are some interactions similar to this that are in as easter-eggs (Vi and Cait have some fun interactions), and as a tentacly dude that kills people for research purposes, it would be a pretty sweet tie-in to his character, I agree.   \nI can't make any promises but I'll mention it to the Narrative and Sound depts and see if that's something we can look at.  They would be the best guys to determine if that's feasible to implement :)","replies":[{"poster":"cHAncEman1292","date":"2014-08-05T21:33:24.456+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I understand!
