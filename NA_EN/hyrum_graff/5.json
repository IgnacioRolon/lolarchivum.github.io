Essentially, I think the final product should mimic what the post looks like before you apply formatting. -> I'd like the same change you made to paragraph breaks with normal text:\r\nA single 'return' makes a new line.\r\n\r\nTwo returns makes a new paragraph.\r\n\r\nI shouldn't have to put 3 returns after \"You can put a space between lines,\" in order to make \"or\" and \"not\" appear one under the other.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nHyrum Graff","replies":[{"poster":"Daen","date":"2014-07-29T19:02:21.579+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"For anyone confused with what this post is saying:\n\n* In order to format a set of bullets\n\n\n* Like\n* This\n\nIt has to look like the following (replacing bullets with tilde):\n\n~ In order to format a set of bullets\n[enter: new line]\n[enter: spacing]\n[enter: ???]\n~ Like\n~ This\n\nObviously this is a bit unnecessary, as it should logically look like this:\n\n~ In order to format a set of bullets\n[enter: new line]\n[enter: spacing]\n~ Like\n~ This\n\nHope that clarifies.","replies":[{"poster":"Hyrum Graff","date":"2014-07-29T19:09:42.657+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is correct, thanks!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Montag","date":"2014-07-31T15:16:08.676+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let me see if I understand. In the situation you're describing, you have two lists that you want to separate with a double newline to indicate that they're different lists (let's call it first list, second list). Logically, you should be able to write something like this[^1]:\n\n> \\- First list, first item\n> \\- First list, second item\n\n> \\- Second list, first item\n> \\- Second list, second item\n\nBut the end result looks weird:\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/5Rd6btR.png\n\nYou'd rather it look like the source: two lists, separated by a small space, or something like this:\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/qlilW00.png\n\nIs that right?\n\n[^1]: Minor footnote, I made the Markdown formatting visible by using an escape character \\\\ in front of the bullet character (\\-). We don't have support for Markdown's version of <code> or <pre> just yet.\n\n**Edit:** Edited for clarity. Even I got confused by first and second lists.

You learn something new every day :D\n\nI like to make list with sub-bullets, and something like this:\n\n- Point one | Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit\n - elaboration one | Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit\n\n\n- Point two | Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit\n - elaboration two | Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit\n\nlooks a lot nicer than\n\n- Point one | Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit\n - elaboration one | Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit\n- Point two | Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit\n - elaboration two | Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit\n\nIn my opinion, at least.

I think the problem is that the Markdown engine is inserting a <p> tag *inside* the second list, which adds an extra margin at the bottom, which creates the weird extra space between the second list's items.
