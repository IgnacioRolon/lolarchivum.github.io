I'd rather see them change the *dragon* to be more blue than keep the icon green.\n\n---\n\n**Edit2:** I played around with this in grayscale, which is the best I know how to simulate being colorblind. Here's what that looks like for the *current* emblems. I found it pretty interesting how the \"random blotches\" actually play a big role in telling them apart, by changing how bright they appear.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/ROjkpgc.png\n\nThe above emblems are easier to tell apart in grayscale than mine, except for air (although part of this is just because of loss of clarity as I have put them through filters). Here's another edit, changing the color/lumosity a little bit to help, including a revert back to Riot's earth emblem. If I were willing to do a bit more work to make it look good, I'd make the water a little brighter, but if I take the shortcut it'll look bad.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/fHMeJCB.png\n\n---\n\n**Edit1:** it never fails to amaze me how much more people vote in polls than vote on the thread. And I didn't even include a joke option..\n\n**Edit3:** I'm talking about, 500 poll votes compared to 175 thread votes. This isn't a complaint about people not upvoting -- I care about the visibility from votes but if my thread is on the front page already, who cares; it's just really interesting to me, that people will use a poll if I make it but not the poll that's built in to the system.","replies":[{"poster":"Wînter Fox","date":"2016-05-05T23:28:15.153+0000","up_votes":57,"down_votes":0,"body":"The Air one definitely screws with me - \"Where's my regen!?
