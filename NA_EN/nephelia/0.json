It starts the download but over the course of three days its only made it to 73% and stopped. Is there a way to make it so that the download doesn't take the rest of my life? I've re-downloaded League before but it has never taken this long.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-03T22:52:04.443+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you have a bad or poor connection then your download could certainly stall, so it will try to go back and pick up files that it missed.  My suggestion would be to use our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to troubleshoot your network and tune it up.
