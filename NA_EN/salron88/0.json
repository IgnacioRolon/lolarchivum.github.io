I'ma spell this out as simple as I can.\n\nYou are a late game tank. There is no such thing, all tanks fall off in the late game. We are strongest mid to early late but easily get outscaled. Secondly, you are a tank. You are also comparing a Jinx to Vayne. Jinx is a hyper carry who relies on finding a quick kill for resets. Vayne is someone who specializes in tank killing. Very few adcs are specd to do so. Vayne, Kog'maw, and I believe Kai'sa. You follow me now? You (a tank) got beat by Vayne (a tank killing adc.) That is what is suppose to happen. It happened. And you are only complaining because of one instance that has you tilted beyond belief. She isn't even a premier adc. If you want to be mad, be mad at yourself for not grouping to beat her with your team. Or be mad at your team for not following with damage behind what tank you brought.","replies":[{"poster":"Salron88","date":"2019-10-05T06:26:33.703+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"again. why is there a champ in the game who renders useless every items in the shop specialised for defense. i want a champion who i can build agaist becouse that is part of the game strategy. i can build vs kaisa and kogmaw. i cant build vs vayne.","replies":[{"poster":"WhyEvenBotherFR","date":"2019-10-05T06:29:03.701+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Salron88,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=swsEHEFw,comment-id=0001000000000000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2019-10-05T06:26:33.703+0000)\n>\n> again. why is there a champ in the game who renders useless every items in the shop specialised for defense. i want a champion who i can build agaist. i can build vs kaisa and kogmaw. i cant build vs vayne.\n\nOne you can't build against a kogmaw. Even with ninja tabi and adaptive helm among other tank items he can still shred tanks in about 5 seconds, sometimes less. He's pretty close to on par with vayne in a latea game setting.

TRUE DAMAGE BASED ON MY HP %. its not based on her hp or attack or crit or whatever. on MINE. i want to be able to build tanky vs her withou % HP TRUE DMG.","replies":[{"poster":"The entire team","date":"2019-10-06T21:49:25.557+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well, too bad. The true damage is there to stay, so play smarter, get around it, or slow her attack speed, or (as any smarter Sejuani player would do) STUN HER. That should stop her from being a threat for a small bit, which is enough for your team to kill her. Besides, she can only shred one target’s health at a time.","replies":[{"poster":"Salron88","date":"2019-10-06T21:58:16.409+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"OR....OR...the true damage is not there to stay if people just start to disscuss it and dont simply go with well thats how it is and its staying that way. \nthen give her that damage in some other way. make it true damage based on her attack but not on a stat that is mine. all im saying is to vayne tank or no tank it does not even matter becouse she was designed outside of the game concept where tanks are tanks and crit adc's are crit adc's not % damage adc .6 hits ur dead.","replies":[{"poster":"The entire team","date":"2019-10-06T23:37:51.419+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"OR... OR... ORR... learn to play around it. She's still super squishy. She's still trash early game. She still has no wave clear. She still has short range compared to other annoying ADCs like Trist and Ashe. She still has the true damage despite the people clamouring to Riot to remove it for 8 years, and it's STILL HERE. That proves that it's not a problem, due to her weaknesses that you, for some reason, can't accept.\n\nBe more tactical against the Vayne. Not just strategic. Because items won't save you, nor will it counter damage dealers like Vayne. Plan your champs against her. Plan what you should do against her.","replies":[{"poster":"Salron88","date":"2019-10-07T11:27:15.079+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"and she has every tool to make up for it. she has been given tumbles which no other adc has becouse she is shorter ranged and she has her ult which makes her disapear from view and show up again once danger has passed. for  a short range adc she has been given dhe kit and mobility to play with it.\n\ni dont want items to save me. i want them to give me an advantage on defense just like with every other adc becouse i focused on defense and for that i lost on attack points and its not paying off.

Caitlyn? Range, crit passive synergy with her self-peel. Ashe? CC and long range initiation. Twitch? STEALTH, which is more annoying that Vayne’s. Kai’sa? Long range poke, magic % damage, INVISIBILITY, speed, and can shred like Vayne, except with self peel. Jinx? Hyper carry potential that’s much more dangerous than Vayne (rawkets hurt). Ezreal? Huge kiting potential. Lucian? A better Vayne, as he needs no stealth to bully early game. Vayne, without her % true damage, would be nothing without it.","replies":[{"poster":"Salron88","date":"2019-10-07T20:33:12.166+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"caitlyn barely has traps to make up for anything ganks included and a small escape barely out of melee hands. \ntwitch has exchanged with vayne stealth for tumbles, which again with ult she can use invisibility and she can push the turget away.\nkaisa can peel if she hits her void seeker.\njinx? getting in from her 3 traps its super easy compared to cait or anyone. she needs cc from someone else or someone running in a straight line to make use of them. \nlucian? he has his escape ability which again vayne has one aswell + push away + invisibility with R\n\nin whole cases mentioned above vayne has the kit to be more mobile then anyone. advantages given to her becouse she is shorter ranged where even if jumped on she can tumble and if in real trouble use R + the push away \nout of all the other adc's she is the worst to catch if tried to jump on out of mobility. so to end the case she has plenty of advantages becouse she is shorter ranged in her kit. its been already made up for.\n\n\nand again i EDIT: you want to give her %health true damage make it based on another stat not the enemys health bar. make it so the % is based on a stat of her own champion so it does not differentiate from tank to squishy so hard damage wise.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
