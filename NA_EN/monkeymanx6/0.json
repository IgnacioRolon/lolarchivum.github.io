It has been a very big problem to have the ability to download the game in one single time. The patcher needs the ability to PAUSE and RESUME the download. It could be a very big improvement if you don't have the time or if you just have a slow data connection like me. I have downloaded around 2500 MB like 3 times and it is a huge bummer to see that you have to download them again while you are on a limited data plan. \"I just wanna play, man.\"\r\n\r\nSo... RITO plz... Hear my plea.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-06T02:50:19.576+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since you're looking to suggest a feature rather than looking for troubleshooting assistance, I recommend reposting this to the [**Miscellaneous Boards**](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous) where it is better suited.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}
