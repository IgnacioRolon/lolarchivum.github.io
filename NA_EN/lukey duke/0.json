I had recently reached out to you guys about a problem that occurred in my shop 9/23/17. You have a promotion event that began about a week ago, that allows you to get discounted prices on skins for champions owned. I had received little devil teemo and a few other skins (irrelevant to this situation), all at high discounted prices. When I first opened them, it was shown that the little devil teemo skin was at a discounted 70% off, making the price: 405rp. I had only 235rp at the time, and I wasn't gonna pass up the opportunity at an epic 1350rp skin for a champion that I play quite often. The following day, I had purchased a 5 dollar subway card in order for me to get the skin that I so desperately wanted. And the next time I login to purchase the skin, I open to see the price of the skin had been increased to 675rp-50% off. Shocked, I had reached out to you/Riot immediately to assort this situation. I STILL haven't received a message, email, or anything regarding what issue had occurred. So now I'm forced to have to spend the extra 270rp because my account is not being accounted for! Honestly, not that big of a deal, because I was planning on purchasing the skin regardless. But its disheartening to know that your community doesn't reach out to all of your players and fans like you claim to do, me, being the clear example. If nothing, I wish the best for the game, as it is a huge part of my life and I hope it continues to expand and grow in numbers! I hope we both learned a lesson from this situation. Mine being not to rely on your employees to accommodate my issues. And for you, I hope you learn to strengthen your support team for further issues. \r\n\r\nThank you again,\r\nLukey Duke","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-27T02:34:06.432+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A little patience goes a long way. I was able to find your ticket, and it looks like it wasn't even in the queue for about a day before someone was able to get to yours. We had a small influx of tickets due to the Shop issues, but we have to work through them in the order they came in, otherwise, it wouldn't be fair. \n\nIf you'll check your email or ticket, you'll see the agent has already responded and is waiting on you to reply ^_^!","replies":[]}]}
