Riot's data has shown that voice communication is more detrimental to the game than it is helpful. On top of that, some people (like me) just don't want voice chat because we'd rather focus on the game rather than chatty teammates, but that also creates the issue of ignoring potentially important communication (yes, muting does the same thing).\n\nBeginning of this article (after the Urf picture):\nhttp://www.surrenderat20.net/2015/04/red-post-collection-urf-q-on-april-6th.html\n\nMore on the topic:\nhttp://www.newsoflegends.com/index.php/lyte-on-why-there-is-no-voice-chat-in-league-but-might-be-when-you-are-chat-restricted-for-not-talking-ironstylus-talks-caitlyns-design-and-more-20942/\n\n\"126% more toxicity and 47% more reports\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"Laughing Fish","date":"2015-06-04T12:03:58.443+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Voice chat is only really good for pre-arranged teams, which could already use Curse/Skype.

The majority have voice chat because it offers an advantage of not having to type everything you want to say and in Riot's case, I think it's pretty underwhelming for the game to be out this long and not offer in-game voice chat and instead, having their playerbase seek third party software to communicate vocally in the game.\n\nThey even promote the use of voice chat with the LCS and the players communicating via mics and headsets, but then not offer it in-game.\n\nJust imagine how those LCS games would go if they took the voice chat away and forced the teams to only communicate via chat and pings. I guarantee you it wouldn't go nearly as smooth.\n\nI will also let it be known that I have joined other peoples/teammates calls and met other people over them. Making my history with voice chat being very positive and noticeably improving my performance and team performance in-game.\n\nNot everyone out there is going to be a nice person, but I find that chatting with people vocally decreases toxicity compared to typing (This is just in my experience) because people tend to be less reluctant to be toxic if they feel as if they're actually talking to a person on the other side of the screen instead of a character using a keyboard.\n\nJust my 2¢.","replies":[{"poster":"The Queen Viper","date":"2015-06-04T14:22:20.416+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Sky Shadow,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=yQrAE38M,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2015-06-04T12:30:02.954+0000)\n> I strongly believe that voice chat should be in the game, however, with an **optional opt-in and opt-out button**.\n\nWell there's no point in that... since we already have one, called Curse Voice. \n\nThose who opt-in will download and use it and those who opt-out, won't.\n\n> I think it's pretty underwhelming for the game to be out this long and not offer in-game voice chat and instead, having their playerbase seek third party software to communicate vocally in the game.\n\nYou don't need voice chat in #yoloQ where people don't give a shit about communication and teamwork anyways.

I am not talking about a premade party who will definitely use skype or so, but on soloqueue or normals. Why do I have to invite random person to my TS server or add someone on Skype JUST to play one match? It makes no sense. The game should offer it by defaut.\n\nThe same way people can be completely jerks on voice chats, they can be even worse texting. How many games did you lost because someone was \"busy\" flaming eachother on chat and always get off guard?\n\nIt is a simple thing: Do you not like voice chat because you're afraid of trolls?
