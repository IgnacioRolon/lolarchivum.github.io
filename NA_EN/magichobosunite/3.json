He is a great pick if the enemy team is tank heavy or has a lot of AD. The ability to forge items in lane gives you a MASSIVE advantage vs the enemy bot lane. It allows you to never have to leave your AD (unless you need to heal or die). It gives you early advantages like boots, the 2nd tier gold income (I use coin), and a SS when the enemy bot lane has starting items. It allows you to not miss exp backing to buy, so if you play well you are basically guaranteed to hit 6 first and your ult (if used well) is almost always a kill in lane. His kit is all about applying Brittle to as many enemy champions as possible, and chaining knockups. He doesn&#039;t need solo lane gold to do it. Try it out.","replies":[]}
