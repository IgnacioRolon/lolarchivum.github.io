Anyhow, I remember Bronze in S3 when I first started playing ranked, and I can honestly say some crazy stuff happens in Silver that I have never seen in other ELOs. \r\n\r\nRecently I have been getting teammates that go \"full r%%%%%\" (which we all know you should never do) and force fights in the worst imaginable places. When the game ends and they have 10, 15, even 20 deaths and I have ~5 I am told \"I did nothing all game because I didn't fight with them\". Apparently making terrible plays and feeding the other team = carrying your team on your back in Silver logic.","replies":[]}
