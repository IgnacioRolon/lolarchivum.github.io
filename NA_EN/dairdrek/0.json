Yet still I agree that these champions are really powerfull , but they can be counteredm pick fiora get rekt with Jax or Jayce, trynda just pick Vladimir you poke him down with q and when he e you, you just go swim on blood, Katarina is the easiest one to counter you just need one cc and nail it when she ults and she is dead supports like Taric Thresh Alistar Annie and Junglers like Rek´sai and lee and Nautilus its just Katarina´s hell, hope I little bit of this type of counters help you when you have to deal against them","replies":[{"poster":"Dairdrek","date":"2015-06-12T04:24:20.020+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for being polite with your response, I didn't think about all the factors I guess :P.
