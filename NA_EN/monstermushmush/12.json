It isn't now. Sometimes Riot makes a Galio or a Kai'Sa, but in most cases, build variety isn't concerned with \"Building lethality and being 100% viable one game, then build full tank and still being 100% viable the next game...as Sivir\". Build variety means that \"Within your role and class, you have a decent breadth of viable items to choose from for different variations of the job you have.\" It's less about making \"Glass cannon AP Zac\" a viable ladder climbing strat and more about making sure that Zac functions well enough as a tank to do his thing. Damage builds on a tank champion are an afterthought. If it works out, cool, but no one cares if it doesn't.\n\nAnd before you get the wrong idea: I tried making damage items like TriForce and Cleaver work out on Poppy for a mad minute, myself. It's just blatantly unnecessary. You feel strong for a bit, but when you use that slot for some mid game damage instead of all-game tankiness, you fall off faster and find yourself unable to make plays where you should be able to because you'd trade 1:1 at best instead of actually survive. Tanks aren't concerned with glass play patterns. It's as much of an afterthought as full tank Sivir. If that means that Riot sort of eliminates the notion outright while trying to make their main play styles better...honestly, not a lot of people care. I'm just being honest.","replies":[{"poster":"dome025","date":"2018-10-24T15:30:12.897+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First: I don´t expect ap Zac to be viable (as I remember it wasn´t viable prior the update either but just the possibilty to build ap existed).\n\nI understand that current Zac has no room for good ap ratios because of the strong cc that got added on his q and the his ult being less punishing (you can´t accidentally knock back enemies into safety anymore if you mess up).\n\nHowever it´s still a legitimate concern of some Zac players, cause they lost something they cared about. \n\nLook for example at Aatrox. Some mains complained that his rework changed his gameplay way to much. Riot was right to rework Aatrox because he was unhealthy (stat check, low counterplay) for the game. Yet it was a legitimate concern of those players cause they lost something they liked to play.

Imagine they only updated his ult.\n\nThis isn't much of a point to get tangled up in in the first place.\n\nZac's rework was done to do the things described previously, and they changed his Q and ult to do that. Separating the changes and analyzing them in a vacuum makes this a question of parts rather than sums, which isn't the point that anyone wants or needs to be discussing in the first place.

He'd E in, and if he hit the E, he ults, which knocks everyone he hit into the air. Riot was trying to elongate tank play patterns so they wouldn't just dump buttons on your face, then wait around with nothing to do like Amumu or Malphite tend to. This new ult, to the least, gives some decision making and counter-play to those involved. \"How long do I charge and where do I send everyone I recently caught?\" vs. \"Do I have the means to escape this before he launches this move?\".

It did three bounces + the initial jump, all knocking back the enemy slightly. Each opponent could only be cc'd once, and it did aoe damage scaling with ap. \n\nLooking at this, the only real difference is in the fact that the damage/cc instances were seperated by 1 second intervals rather than Wukongs persistant ult.\n\nCompared to Zac's current ult, which can bring one or many opponents to a certain spot, his old ult was less impactful.

Tanks shouldn't win 1v1s regardless. Technically speaking the only thing the old ult did better in a 1v1 was it did more damage. Riot could theoretically just buff the numbers to the old value on a full charged ult and it is \"equally\" as good as the old one in a 1v1. The thing is tanks should not do well in 1v1s (barring exceptions such as Cho) since they have much stronger 2v2s and 5v5s than the non-tank junglers. Zac has VERY \"unfair\" gank patterns and does extremely well in counterganks since he offers SO much CC to the table that giving him an \"alright\" 1v1 as well will cause him to be a tier 0 jungler again.","replies":[{"poster":"dome025","date":"2018-10-24T16:07:08.526+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Tanks shouldn't win 1v1s regardless.\n\nCool, except old tank Zac wasn´t able to 1vs1 someone.

And it also triggered Rylais which helped him to escape.\n\n>The thing is tanks should not do well in 1v1s (barring exceptions such as Cho) since they have much stronger 2v2s and 5v5s than the non-tank junglers.\n\nThey shouldn´t be the best at duels, however this doesn´t mean that they should be total garbage in 1vs1 situations. Also Cho is rather a juggernaut (still a subclass of tanks but different to the traditional tanks).\n\n>Zac has VERY \"unfair\" gank patterns and does extremely well in counterganks since he offers SO much CC to the table that giving him an \"alright\" 1v1 as well will cause him to be a tier 0 jungler again.\n\nYeah and his new ult and q make his gank patterns more unhealthy. New q is stronger for ganks than his old q because of the additonal, hard to mess up with it cc and his ult just got harder to mess up with / less counterplay for the enemy.\n\nHowever I need to admit that his new ult is also good in 1vs1 situations. I didn´t know that it was possible to activate it without a channel for a knock back. But I would say that his old ult was still better for disengaging in 1vs1 situations (it was more forgiving -you could still mess up/ the enemy could still play around it- and more effective in 1vs1 situations).","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"zlumpy","date":"2018-10-23T13:32:03.267+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"The old ult resulted in more healing for him as well allowing him to stay longer in an enemy team and actually tank.
