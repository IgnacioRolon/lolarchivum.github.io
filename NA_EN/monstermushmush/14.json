If you want to escape a gank, it's QEWQ for the long snare. If you want a ton of damage, it was QWQEQ. If you wanted to waveclear, it was EEQ... Now it's just EQ. His E bounce does no damage. You need to Q to use the flux spread damage. I know that he's nearly impossible to balance, but these are my observations. I have no idea on how to fix him.
