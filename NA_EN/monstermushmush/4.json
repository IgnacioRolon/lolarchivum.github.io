They most certainly have too much damage, because y&#x27;all can pretty much one-shot anyone at any time with little to no preparation.\n> \n> Basically buff up and take your enemy by suprise.\n\nIf you think that, then you've literally got an extra chromosome. Having the damage to 100-0 someone is completely different from actually 100-0-ing someone. If having the damage is all matters, then Karthus should be a 1v5 freelo champ with 100% winrate. Aside from the counterplay built into each assassin's kit, the damage of all assassins are also already gated by macro plays such as grouping the squishies with someone who has {{summoner:3}} , building BS items like {{item:3026}} {{item:3157}} , and rotating better than the assassin to avoid them altogether. That's why assassins aren't just running through two towers to bulldoze an ADC whenever they feel like it. That's also why assassins need more damage--any worthwhile player would do one of those things to deny assassins a full combo on a lone ADC. So, if an assassin can only delete people under the most ideal situations, then they would be absolutely fucking worthless beyond silver or bronze or whatever hellhole you crawled out of. As the game currently is, the kill potential of assassins are gated more than enough, and if you think anything beyond that is necessary, please stop responding to me. You'll just be a waste of my time. ","replies":[{"poster":"WAZZZUP500","date":"2018-12-17T12:47:13.929+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What a dickhead. Don't take what i say out of context.
