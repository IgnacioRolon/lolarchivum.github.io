What you gain from it on a PERSONAL level (Shyvana alone) isn't worth the struggle of either sneaking the first one, or grouping to kill the rest. If the enemy team is any good, they will be ready for Shyvana to try to take dragon. \n\nShyvana can take dragon at level 4 or 5 depending on her rune setup and health. If ANYONE comes by pit for any reason or it is warded, she will die. Even a Janna can sit there and auto Shyvana and win if she is caught fighting the first dragon.  All it takes is an early ward, map awareness, and timing awareness. Any dragon Shyvana and her team engage after that is wholly dependent on back timers, death timers, and shotcalling. I have played plenty of games where the enemy team had a Shyvana and I just kept dragon warded the whole game. We played smart, didn't fight bad fights, and were able to easily deny her any benefits to her passive. She can't duel most junglers and win until level 6. And even then, all she gets in dragon form is a tiny bit of health and extra damage on her E.\n\nDon't get me started on the proposed jungle experience changes. That's just going to make things even worse for powerfarmers.","replies":[{"poster":"xDogMeatx","date":"2019-01-18T20:29:06.030+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i hate jungle nerfs just saying it makes jungle less fun. 2ndly all i can say its a team dependent type champ run conditioning if you want to boost it further.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Monstermushmush","date":"2019-01-19T19:08:22.424+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Corrector1,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=FwV9thcW,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2019-01-18T19:19:35.080+0000)\n>\n> actually her style of play is this she gets more &quot;theory stat&quot; gold per dragon kill so she doesnt have to buy defense items as much as other divers/ fighters. it rewards more aggressive objective taking.\n\nIt's literally 5 MR and armor.
