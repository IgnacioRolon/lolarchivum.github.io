Not only has Riot made the jungle neigh impossible for 80% of the cast, but if a lane loses, it's your fault. Top dies because they have the enemy pushed right into their turret, no wards, and they get ganked; first thing \"Jung where are you?!?!\". Oh I'm sorry? Was I suppose to be a living animated ward to just sit in the bush and guard you? You tell bot you are coming to gank and suddenly they start pushing, wiping out whole minion waves and push the enemy back instead of playing cat and mouse. Ok....great, I made the trek down here for nothing; you leave after sitting in a bush for 10 seconds and they get ganked 15 seconds later \"WOW jung wtf???\" \r\n\r\nEnemy just took Dragon jung, no wards? Seriously? Yes seriously.... I am already under leveled, and have a fraction of the gold you have in lane, you really think I can afford that quick pink ward instead of an extra 2 health pots? \r\n\r\nWell, game is lost, Jung is too busy farming instead of helping. Again.... sorry but ya know..... I can't really gank that lane when you already gave them 3 kills and they are now 3 levels above me. I guess you want me to show up so they can 2 shot me as a meat shield and you MIGHT be able to somehow get a kill.\r\n\r\nJung has now become the dumping ground for blame since they are suppose to support every lane.

It's hilarious that this statement is even followed by several replies from other people who are, even further, criticizing his jungle skills, like as if this abuse is all still his fault somehow, as in it's justified abuse. One can't even address the fact that there's negativity aimed at junglers AS A CONCEPT without yet more harassment about their jungling. This more than proves his point that jungling is and has been for some time 'the dumping ground for blame'. It's true, and everyone who's jungled for a significant amount of games knows this.\n\nI used to main jungle and I would win a lot more than I currently do, but I main support now instead due to the enormous amount of harassment associated with jungle. Junglers also without a doubt receive far more mostly invalid reports than other positions. But because of such sheer numbers of reports, it will bury your account even if you think you're really good at not responding to verbal abuse. The toxicity will bury your account over time. Even if you mute everyone in every game and say nothing - you will be reported for 'failure to communicate' 'unskilled' 'negative attitude' and 'helping the enemy'. There will be harassment in 1. pretty much every game that you lose and 2. sometimes you will actually win a game for the team but if someone in a lane somewhere feeds and has a bad game, they will still blame you and say that you're horrible just because they alone are having a bad game. In the end game score screen, it will say 'victory' and show stats that indicate a stomp, but this one guy will be the first to type something and he says 'garbage jungle'. I also routinely see people like this type essentially 'terrible jungle, it would've ended much sooner if you came to my lane. thanks for wasting everyone's time, you bronze noob.' Literally, this would be a situation where I helped bot snowball instead of wasting my time and resources helping a feeding top laner try to kill a fed super tank which probably wouldn't even prove successful anyway. And it's always a Riven, or a Fiora, or Tryndamere, or Teemo, sometimes that rare Nasus who thinks he can carry even though he has no Q stacks yet. It's literally always these people. And they're unreasonable, overly aggressive, they feed, they never know what counters them until it happens. And just playing jungle in those games will destroy your account because there's no way to control who you queue up with and according to these people - if you are jungle, it's always your fault.\n\nSo yes, jungle is the toilet of this game. The changes to jungle have added more complexity to the position that's already the most complicated. There's no other position where you're expected to win every lane for other people AND win all the major objectives at the same time - ALL while giving blue to your MID laner, giving red to your ADC and for the most part NOT receiving help if you happen to get in a counter jungle fight. This is all according to what I've heard people say junglers are supposed to do. The socially constructed 'expectations' for this position are unreasonable and at the very least the abuse needs to stop. \n\n{{summoner:11}}","replies":[{"poster":"SteveBoss24","date":"2018-01-10T06:49:56.871+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is so beautiful I'm on the verge of tears.

Because those 3 values right there, are the reason why jungler who can play those 3 very well dont get blamed. They can survive the jungle long enough to roll through safer ganks than Diana and Evelynn can and farm more gold before backing. they dont level as slowly because of these two factors and aren't as poor.

I start smite Gromp - wolves - baron crab - smite blue - Krugs - dragon crab - smite red - and if i don't gank, maybe raptors - krugs/wolves again. then back.\non the other side i go smite Krugs - raptors - dragon crab - smite red - wolves - baron crab - smite blue - gromp - counterjungle/top gank - or go red side again for more raptors or krugs. don't forget the crabs can not only net vision for your top and bot for ganks from enemy jg, but also grant over 50 gold per kill and allow you to recharge your smite for buffs and clears while your health naturally regens.\nwith a gank scored on this route can even net you about 1200-1400 gold on first back and if you play right, you can go back with another 1200-2000 gold on second back with good ganks and clears. \n\nfind me someone else that can do that other than those 3? you might find a few, but not as safely and the ability to do that is what keeps you from getting jungle flamed.

Was I suppose to be a living animated ward to just sit in the bush and guard you? **You tell bot you are coming to gank and suddenly they start pushing, wiping out whole minion waves and push the enemy back instead of playing cat and mouse.** Ok....great, I made the trek down here for nothing; **you leave after sitting in a bush for 10 seconds and they get ganked 15 seconds later **\"WOW jung wtf???\" \n> \n> **Enemy just took Dragon jung, no wards? Seriously? Yes seriously.... I am already under leveled, and have a fraction of the gold you have in lane, you really think I can afford that quick pink ward instead of an extra 2 health pots? **\n> \n> Well, game is lost, **Jung is too busy farming instead of helping**. Again.... sorry but ya know..... I can't really gank that lane when you already gave them 3 kills and they are now 3 levels above me. I guess you want me to show up so they can 2 shot me as a meat shield and you MIGHT be able to somehow get a kill.\n> \n> Jung has now become the dumping ground for blame since they are suppose to support every lane. Between Riots horrible jungle balance and design, coupled with  toxic team-mates under the assumption they can never ever possibly make a mistake, jung is a report waiting to happen.\n\n**...Top dies because they have the enemy pushed right into their turret, no wards, and they get ganked**\n\nso top is pushed under the turret defending a 2v1 situation, cant leave the turret or it will go down from the enemy top and jungle..... ward was taken out by the jg with his sweeper, lucky your top saw this and ran to turret and is asking for your help so you can help push back the 2v1 situation, maybe counter gank...\n\n**You tell bot you are coming to gank and suddenly they start pushing, wiping out whole minion waves and push the enemy back instead of playing cat and mouse.**\n \nbot was doing well, they dropped the enemies adc hp to a 1/4 and were going for a kill after you pinged that you were coming bot... from top... after you recall, maybe a min latter if the situation doesnt change, like you go somewhere else to grank, or farm, or try to counter the jg taking your blue... \n\n**you leave after sitting in a bush for 10 seconds and they get ganked 15 seconds later **\n\nwhy are you sitting in bush for 10 sec if it is not a good ganking time?, did you search for wards, did you ask the bot if there were wards, do you know where the enemy jg is, getting ganked 15 sec after you leave sounds like a planned move by the enemy team\n\n**Enemy just took Dragon jung, no wards? Seriously? Yes seriously.... I am already under leveled, and have a fraction of the gold you have in lane, you really think I can afford that quick pink ward instead of an extra 2 health pots? **\n\nif you have less gold than the support (generally the one who wards dragon the most imo) there might be other issues there.... if it is just hapstance that it worked out like that, maybe ask your bot lane to ward it for you this time, you will get it next.... or there is that free trinket you can get... \n\n**Jung is too busy farming instead of helping I can't really gank that lane when you already gave them 3 kills and they are now 3 levels above me. **\n\nare you a farming jg? are you a late game monster who needs that farm and wont be ganking lanes.... did you explain this to your team, maybe they are not at your skill level and need to have this small but important fact explained to them about your champion, nothing wrong with helping people with relevant information... also did they \"give up\" those kills because the enemy jg was down in lane camping them while you were farming, maybe your time could have been better spent pushing another lane, or helping to gank someone else if you are a ganking champ\n\nalso communication with your team that you are under leveled and underfed might go a long way to giving you a helping hand... i think most people expect their jg to be doing well unless they are keeping track of them, and simply telling your team to be more defensive because you are not doing well can go a long way to preventing ganks..... you know, team game\n\n\nso many ways of looking at the same general information, im sorry you had a bad game but there are a lot of people playing with you, a little bit of help from you maybe will make all of your playing experiences better....  but hey, im not a very good player myself, i just do it for the fun so maybe im wrong","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ada Wong","date":"2015-02-11T10:31:29.564+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Blame the jungle for your own mistakes of dying to a {{champion:64}}  or {{champion:76}}  if you die to such a jungler, or even {{champion:114}}  I have to say in my opinion its really your fault, shouldn't have over extend so much, should have warded.\n\nYeah junglers can be to blame, but when you go and feed the enemy jungler yourself, don't ward properly then you start raging at your jungler for not doing so well, yeah its your own fault.\n\nTeam Compositions win games rather than just playing counters too but things that work better in team based fights.\n\nAnother thing to look at is why players go into champions like {{champion:11}}  or {{champion:114}}  but no one on the team builds a {{item:3110}}  {{item:3143}}  and better yet why your supports never build a {{item:3001}}  in some situations it benefits your ap carry.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Xela Syab","date":"2015-02-12T16:27:29.961+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Jung is pretty much roaming support, you do need to deploy vision, peel for carry, and set up ganks.

Probably the role that mute the more persons per game (could be cool to get a stat @Riot Lyte),\n\nBecause, you can't do the same thing the enemy jungler does, you normally aren't playing the same champion so you gotta take advantage of what your champ can do not what the other champ can do.\n\nAlso, some junglers prefer to farm the jungle than try to gank. It has been said, if you don't clear your jungle, it falls off, making it's exp/gold less worth. Wich makes messed ganks really bad for your farm and makes you behind in exp/gold. It can only comes with experience to know what's gankable and what's not, can't really blame your jungler for it, but if you explain to him gently how you want him to gank(route and wards to dodge) he may come for a gank.\n\nThe sentence I use the most as a jungler/support person is \"Stfu and play the game\". That may sound rude to someone but blaming me (or any other person) isn't gonna fix is problem, and if he wants to win the game I appreciate his input but I clearly indicate him after that if he doesn't stop I will just mute him.\n\nAs a jungler, I really like to ward for my fellow laners but everyone needs to pull his part. Because, if you ward, I can make it better, not make it all. Jungle is about pressure not \"defending\" your lane that's your job.\n\nWhat I will do:\n Ok you're mid and ward a side, nice I'll ward the other! You're top you ward river, Good! I'll ward your tri-bush if I come. You're both lane and ward dragon/tri-bush. Excellent! I'll ward their buff next to your lane so you can invade with me the enemy jungle.\n\nI personally jungle Sion atm, prob best clear, good support/tank(Probably the best tank in the jungle atm). only big weakness you can't kill turtles(river creep) easily. You will also bait the enemy top laner pick since Sion is mostly played top.","replies":[]},{"poster":"L7xLoTek","date":"2015-02-12T09:18:36.872+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, yes, and heaven forbid if you are babysitting bot-mid and keeping them in the game and slowly getting them fed.

No, it stopped being fun. No matter who it is, if they lose lane because they aren't playing safe it's ALWAYS your fault. Doesn't matter what happened, it's all you because you didn't gank RIGHT when they wanted you to. I've gone back to midlane myself.. give your junglers a break people!
