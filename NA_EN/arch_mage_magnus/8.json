They hardly (if at all) watch the LCS. It's not a point of view type issue, the casters do not favor any champion over with the exception of Quickshot and Rek Sai. The 5 man Cass ult was a bigger deal (and it had no impact on the outcome of the game) than the great Ori ults from Slooshie (which won them the game).  None of the big plays so far have been any of the mentioned champs singularly, all the big plays have been combos or other champs.
