While standing still there is almost no noticable difference between a tanky Sion and a glass cannon Sion.  Tank Sion dies unbelievably fast due to his terrible lifesteal/dmg and the pathetic chasing required to hit someone.  The window for his passive is so small that any CC negates the passive entirely and if he does get in range of a target only ad Sion can lifesteal enough to survive long enough to do any damage.  Bottom line, I tried tank Sion and his passive was about as useful as a popsicle stick in a gun fight.","replies":[]},{"poster":"thatdude2090","date":"2014-11-06T11:13:06.702+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, passive feels completely underwhelming now.

It's good he has more HP now off kills and levels from soul furnace, but his passive which was already pretty useless, becomes even more useless. Since he becomes a mindless zombie on death, he should be immune to CC. Like.... honestly, if everyone auto attacks him anyway he dies within seconds, so I don't see the big deal. He JUST might be able to re-enact revenge, but he sure as hell isn't going to pull a Karthus and score a possible Pentakill.","replies":[]}]}
