If it was Shiv and IE then i'd agree and even then a Yasuo who falls behind is useless except for wind wall, even his ultimate is useless because it will do no damage and he'll get instagibbed the moment his falls from his ultimate.","replies":[{"poster":"Crossette","date":"2016-01-12T21:14:58.717+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I realize what you meant.\n\nI'm just saying that I've almost never seen a Yasuo player sub 300 farm at 30 minutes, myself included.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"The Deckowner","date":"2016-01-12T04:23:06.912+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"honestly a 0/5 yasuo in lane shouldnt be able to get any farm, 4 levels behind and wont ever reach the two item.","replies":[{"poster":"Arch Mage Magnus","date":"2016-01-12T06:01:43.575+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=The Deckowner,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=3Yeue7vQ,comment-id=000b,timestamp=2016-01-12T04:23:06.912+0000)\n>\n> honestly a 0/5 yasuo in lane shouldnt be able to get any farm, 4 levels behind and wont ever reach the two item.\n\nWhen you have to leave lane to help your struggling top or bot, yea.....he gets free farm for a few mins.
