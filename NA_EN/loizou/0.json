Don't remember specifically how to disable it, but there's some Nvidia control panel you can open, and if you disable stereoscopic 3d mode there, you \"should\" be good to go.","replies":[]},{"poster":"loizou","date":"2016-07-18T09:14:28.897+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"ty my friend  i disable  stereoscopic 3d mode and now the game is like before  :))","replies":[]}]}
