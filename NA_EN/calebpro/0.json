Plat is when mechanics making really get refined. An exception to this is Plat 5 where the mechanics/decision making are completely variable. The development of decision making is fairly consistent through all leagues. Also, ADC has a very high skill cap. The issue with ADC is that they are stuck in a duo lane. To show how this is a factor there will be a bit of math (For this scenario we will say it is 50% whether you are better than them or not) . So 50% that you are a better adc, for you to win lane we will say that both you and your support must be better than the opponents. If one of you is better than your opponents but not the other the lane is canceled out. Using this method, you get a 25% chance of winning lane, a 25% chance of losing lane, and a 50% chance of the lane going even. This is why adc skill could possibly be considered less important than support or other lanes. The laners have a 50% chance of winning(on a side note i realized i didn't take consideration other lanes going even, however I feel that solo lanes usually do have a person that comes out substantially stronger even if the lane isnt 10/0) while adcs usually go even or don't have a substantial lead on the other team and can have less impact on the game than any laner until late game. One final point. If you look at Chinese adcs in a professional game or even Rekkles, you will see that adcs have a skill cap that is as high or higher than other laners.","replies":[{"poster":"PapaFizz","date":"2014-12-28T08:19:24.969+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I disagree about the first part. Mid Silver is when actual mechanics become more competent. Bronze mechanics are absolute shit. CS between Bronze and Mid silver aren't even comparable \"Muh 100 CS at 20 Minutes Average\". I'd like to say Silver 4 to Platinum 3 is only a slight improvement in mechanics. There's literally almost no difference between a silver and a gold as far as I can tell. Decision making for both is \"Odd\" at best. Jungle thou. The improvement between a Silver and even Gold jungler is just MASSIVE. Neither ward at all but clear times and gank performance is just vastly improved. \n\nMaybe you're right about Plat V being the only variable. I've noticed that all the V's in every Division are \"Bad\". My primary experience with Plats has always been Plat 5s and 3s (I can rarely find a 4 for some reason) in draft pick (Norms) So I'm probably speaking out of my ass.","replies":[{"poster":"Skorzen","date":"2014-12-28T20:02:39.915+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not to be a douche here, but Mid Silver has no mechanics. Low gold is like low silver. It is basically the same as the league under it and unless you can compare a ranked game between high gold to high silver then I don't think you can make the claim that their is no mechanical improvement. CSing is the most basic mechanic and is developed the earliest but gold-plat more mechanics are developed, such as when to shove lane, orb-walking and dealing with split pushing. Jungling development is primarily mechanical between silver and gold.Drag pressure gets really emphasized in mid to high gold which is where you see a lot of jungler decision making. To be brutally honest, statistically what your saying cannot be true because the ranking system is so steep. Since silver is in the middle of the curve the difference between gold and silver would be minimal (which it basically is). The difference between silver and plat has a much more severe slope than the silver to gold slope.The difference in mechanical skill would have to also increase dramatically.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Hex the FenFen","date":"2014-12-27T10:01:13.921+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know how you feel :( I main {{champion:143}} support and my teammates always dive or something stupid thinking i can save them...like...come on...It is very irritating I can say that much.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zirzon","date":"2014-12-27T08:44:45.561+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I got to gold by doing nothing but filling whatever role was left.

Carrying through jungle is easier than carrying through toplane since you have a way bigger impact.

The more you play the better your micro and understanding of the game will be. Communication is also huge. If you get ahead get deep wards( enemy jungle) and roam. The more people you can help the better off your team will be. Lastly don't tilt and if you do keep it to yourself. Support is generally the least micro intensive role besides jungle in the game. Solo laners and AD's have to dedicate a lot of their focus on farming and trading and don't need your venting stacked on that. If you can do anything to mitigate awareness issues on their part do it. Call out summoners and and enemy jungler location. Ping ALL lanes that don't have enemy champions in them for prolonged periods of time. Big objectives should be warded constantly after the 10 minute mark.
