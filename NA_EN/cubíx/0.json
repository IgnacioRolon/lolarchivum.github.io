Sure there's a group of people like that, but seems like a lot of smurfs did it more to play with friends at lower ranks than anything else.

Enemy premades are flashing taunts, emotes, and badges on dead bodies. Premades are allowed to get away with murder and not get in trouble for it. They can have their entire team report one person, usually the fill in, and that player will get in trouble.\n\nThe problem is Riot is going to segregate casual and ranked players even more if they do this. Do casual players that have no desire to play ranked, be forced to deal with the problems we have now? They will get paired with toxic premades and go against them, they will not receive the same rewards, there will still be no communication, and it just isn't fun to lose four to five games in a row because you are up against a premade of three or more.\n\nIt's not fun for casual players and it is not fun for ranked players. What makes ranked players so special that they need to have everything adjusted to them? Are you saying casual players do not matter? The system of Dynamic Que itself is poorly designed, though out, and favors too much towards group play. We all know to a certain extent League of Legends is a team centered game. Riot has to understand that there are players that prefer to play by themselves. Forcing players to fill spots of premades and go up against them, with none of the same rewards, is not going to solve the problems. Ranked and normal matches should function the same matchmaking wise . . . . and Riot shouldn't force any player to play how they want them to play.","replies":[{"poster":"Cubíx","date":"2016-07-06T16:26:47.942+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But all the thing you've said happened prior to DQ, premades have always been a thing in normals.\n\nAlso players are less toxic in normals because there's nothing to lose, sure some people still want to win but basically there is on the line compared to ranked. I play groups of 4 in normal games and I mean personally we don't bother the other player, there's no reason too. The reason I bring this up is in normals people are there to play the game, thats all, while in ranked you're there to win and climb, people will be more volatile ranked always. As for casual players mattering more or less, riot already shows the buff and nerf characters based on competitive play so theres that.\n\nI think the thing is that DQ has made premades more noticeable and with ranked people can climb together doesn't really show they are performing better then they once were. Where as in normals there isn't anything to climb its just people playing the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Vanjie","date":"2016-07-06T16:44:30.785+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Again, I will say that it isn't fair to favor ranked players over casuals. Premades receive better rewards, are more toxic to other players, and players are losing 70% of their matches against premades. Dynamic Que favors premades way to much without any compensation to solo players. Casual players do matter and stop acting as if ranked players are high and mighty compared to them. You sound elitist right now.","replies":[{"poster":"Cubíx","date":"2016-07-06T16:48:00.436+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think you understand where I stand, I am one of the casual players.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
