I&#039;m sure a thread similar to this has been opened but I couldn&#039;t find anything that gave any answers so here&#039;s mine:\r\n\r\nI&#039;ve played a bit of ranked this season, only 80 games or so, and this is the first season where I&#039;m actually REALLY trying to get somewhere and I just have one question ..\r\n\r\n**Why the hell is this SO hard?**\r\n\r\nI obviously don&#039;t know if it is like this in high elo, and I&#039;ve only seen bronze in my life, but the amount of toxic people, trolls, and afk is ridiculous. \r\nYesterday I had a bad lose streak, which I can understand. You win some and you lose some. However, I can&#039;t understand how in that lose streak, three losses are because people afk&#039;d after remake, 4 people got tilted after one death 3 minutes in and so they feed, and one person who got top instead of jg got mad because our jg didn&#039;t trade and instead banned the champ he wanted, so he auto locked nunu with smite and followed the jg around. In addition to that, I&#039;ve played with people who will be like, &quot;Let&#039;s go in.&quot; and then bust a U and leave mid fight, when they&#039;re the only fed person or they know their ult or presence is the ultimate game changer, or scream at me because I die one or two times which only makes me play worse. I&#039;ve also dealt with enemy BM, spamming mastery after they went 0/8 and got carried, general taunting in /all. If my KDA is really bad, saying things like, _______ are you playing league or a colorblind simulator?&quot; &#039;cause of gray death screen and the infamous &quot;GG EZ&quot;, sometimes spamming in 200 times. And half the time you can&#039;t even mute them because if you do, A. they&#039;ll try to play the victim in /all, or B. they&#039;ll spam the MIA pings any time you do anything at all ever, which I think needs to be addressed but that&#039;s another issue.\r\n\r\nNow, not saying I&#039;m a god player that doesn&#039;t belong in bronze. I&#039;m there, I guess, so that&#039;s where I should be, but it&#039;s a different story when I could be advancing, but instead 3 games in the past 24 hours (2 yesterday, one today) are lost because we had to let the enemy team run it down mid and end at 10 minutes because people feed then leave. Like, shouldn&#039;t there be something in place where if it can be proven that if someone knowingly causes a team to lose, either with an intentional afk, obvious intentional feeding (Like, if you got it on video since I record all of my games for example), or something where they know their actions or things they say (Like telling the enemy team were our jg is going, where our mid is about to roam etc) will cause the enemy team to win or give them an advantage, shouldn&#039;t that be an immediate punishment where the wrongdoer is punished and important stuff like our MMR isn&#039;t effected so heavily? In some of those losses alone I drop from 50 to 20-something and I have to start the climb all over again.\r\n\r\nIt&#039;s just stuff like that that is SO frustrating and makes me not want to play this game anymore. I hate having to join a game and pray to god that I get a normal team with normal people that just want to win. And I&#039;m normally a pretty optimistic and happy person, I&#039;m always happy to make a sacrifice for the team, unless I&#039;ve already played 5 support games in a row, if someone doesn&#039;t want support and its a lane I can play, I&#039;m happy to switch. I&#039;m happy to play what the team needs, etc, and I actively make custom games to practice last hitting, skillshots, whatever. It&#039;s like I&#039;m trying my hardest and it isn&#039;t anywhere near enough when someone joins your game with the intention to feed and lose. I go and take breaks so I don&#039;t bring my tilt to the next game, and when I come back refreshed I just end up frustrated all over again because the same thing I just left happens again.\r\n\r\nHere&#039;s some examples of some things I&#039;ve had happen that I can&#039;t even begin to control.\r\n_In Champ Select_\r\n{{champion:104}} : I Go Jg I carry OK? OK \r\n{{champion:164}} : *Doesn&#039;t respond*, *Bans {{champion:104}} *\r\n{{champion:104}} : Lol\r\n{{champion:104}}: *Auto-locks  {{champion:20}} {{summoner:11}} and follows our jg around the entire game trying to steal creeps. Spamming &quot;Don&#039;t get the yeti angry&quot;, dance, and laugh.*\r\nWe tried to fight but he also fed and Camille got out farmed for obvious reasons.\r\n\r\n*Joining game*\r\n{{champion:105}} Ping is too high. I&#039;ll let you guys remake\r\n{{champion:105}} *Doesn&#039;t leave so we can remake*\r\n{{champion:105}} *Goes to lane, dies twice, disconnects and reconnects the rest of the game.\r\nWe had to let them run it down mid and end at 10 minutes.*\r\n\r\nSo, do problems like this decrease a little in silver+? Should it be this hard to get out of bronze if you&#039;re a &quot;good player&quot; but you can&#039;t carry every game? Is this just &quot;Elo Hell&quot; or some bad games? What do I do in situations like this or is there someone apart of riot I can tell about these people especially if I have them actively trolling or feeding on video? How do **you** guys manage in situations like this? I usually just leave when i start to feel my undying optimism fading and come back in an hour or two, and I just repeat for every 2-3 games I lose. Thanks a bunch for help in advance as well as reading my heated rant/vent.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-03-09T01:14:13.122+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can confirm that silver/gold is a clownfest as well, several times worse than any previous season.\nToo many changes, balance issues and MMR reset, rip ranked.\n\nIt is just not worth wasting thousands of hours of your precious life struggling for a free skin and a border.\n\nWhen i joined league in 2013, i thought \"feeder\" was a myth and a word used to insult people having bad games.\nI continued to think that until this season.\n\nYesterday i had a game with **three** clear intentional feeders, one on the other team, two (premade bot) on mine. They just ran down lane and suicided by tower diving or stood still/CSed and let people attack them.\n\nNobody was surprised or really cared, because it is in every single game now.","replies":[{"poster":"Tzi","date":"2017-03-09T01:45:33.217+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah exactly! That's how I feel right now. Like sometimes I get games with ints and I'm like \"Really again?\" and then sometimes I'm like \"Welp. Again..\"\n\nAnd the thing is, I'm playing ranked partially for the border and skin, and partially just to see how far I can get. I know I can do at least a _little_ better than bronze, but games like that make it seem more like a dream than a reality. \n\nI have a friend that was in Plat last year. He's been sitting in gold I this whole time because of \"bad games\", even though he knows, and I know, and everyone knows, he can do better than Gold.\n\nSorry you're having bad games, too. I hope it gets better for us all.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Learn From Loses","date":"2017-11-29T19:30:08.871+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well your first problem is, you give up way too fast. Give your team hope, give them power help them! Idk what role you're playing but mid is a GREAT role to carry, just try to give them positive hope and if they still flame just mute them and move on. They will only make you distracted so let them go. Btw i also hate it to mute people but yeah, think about it like this: I can play way better and do so many more things if i just mute him and keep focussing!","replies":[]},{"poster":"GarthBrooksXD","date":"2017-03-09T01:09:43.240+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have a bronze account that I play on for fun or to carry friends sometimes and i can win every game at command pretty much. I do throw games on purpose on it to keep it low rank however. \n\nThe toxicity you are talking about is uncommon even for bronze and silver in my experience. Just some bad luck. I have literally had spans of like 20 games where I played very well or decently in at least 50% of the games and went like 3-17. You have to remember that this game does have a luck component and that you are the only constant thing you can control from game to game.\n\nPLZ do a few things to help yourself out. \n1. Disable all/chat\n2. Either make your chat the smallest the settings allow or just mute all at the start of the game and focus on YOUR gameplay and say nothing at all in chat\n3. Follow the recommended builds including runes and masteries until you get a firmer grasp on game knowledge\n4. Think about what YOUR mistakes are in every part of every game and how you could have made a situation better, even if it was a winning situation, you are bronze and could have played a winning play better almost certainly. \n\nJust focus on improving rather than win/loss etc... mute your retarded teammates and focus on YOU and the wins will start to come naturally.","replies":[{"poster":"Tzi","date":"2017-03-09T01:53:06.420+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I dunno. I really really hate the idea of having to mute everyone every single game but I guess that's just how it is. I kind of don't want to mute so that if someone does randomly start feeding, I at least know why as opposed to: \n\n*Tab*\n{{champion:121}} 0/4\n*Unmute*\n{{champion:121}} \"AND I HOPE YOU KYS YOU --\"\n\nSo that if, maybe, riot impliments a feature where if you're caught on video being a jerk it helps in reporting. I also don't like muting because what if they actually have something to say and they don't ping it, like \"Let's try for baron\", \"Let's group mid,\" or \"Blah blah laner MIA\" since sometimes I type out my MIAS or enemy laner recalls after pinging.\n\nEverything else, though, I already do, lol. I pretty much play to the meta in terms of builds and runes and I try all my funsy stuff in normals like good league player. :^)\n\nAs for 4. I rewatch almost all my games and look at teamfights to figure out where I could be standing and what else I could've been doing, etc. I guess that's why it's more frustrating. I go the extra mile to constantly improve and it's never enough.

I finished in gold last season but this season I seem to be in games with many players trolling for fun unluckily. \nI have started a discussion to try and develop a method which would reduce the amount of trolling in League immediately instead of using just the Tribunal which punishes after the match is over and does little to prevent multiple account trolls. \n\nIn my experience the few years I've played this game (started back in 2012) the number of trolls seems to remain consistent but does taper down a bit in Gold (perhaps due to players taking their ranking more seriously, or just the fact that a troll probably isn't a great player and may have a hard time getting to higher elo's) But that's just my opinion based off of my experience.\n\nThe discussion is linked below your experience and suggestions would be appreciated!\n\n[http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/KYT3Mr6n-trolls-and-negative-players-an-immediate-solution-vote-now](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/KYT3Mr6n-trolls-and-negative-players-an-immediate-solution-vote-now)","replies":[{"poster":"Tzi","date":"2017-03-09T01:15:13.815+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh, sweet!
