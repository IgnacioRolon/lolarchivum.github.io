Stop crying like 5 year olds if you dont get bot. Your not obligated to get bot lane just cause you duo. Its not different then solo queue. I dont get no special treatment why should you? Like sure maybe a duo bot may usually have better communication. But that does not mean you are obligated to get it. Please stop trolling games if you dont get your role","replies":[{"poster":"DreadPirateChris","date":"2015-04-08T08:10:35.255+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"While it's true that pick order still rules if you want to insist on taking one of those roles you can... but consider that the bot lane duo is being matched with a higher MMR team than their actual MMR (to adjust for the presumed teamwork they will have). If you push them off of their main roles, into roles they are less comfortable with in situations where their communication is less important than in botlane, they will probably do badly. When they start feeding, it's not because they are trolling you, it's because they are out of their depth because they were matched with an MMR adjustment that -assumes- they are a coordinated pair. \n\nYou can do what you want, but you might have a better chance of winning if you let them have their lane.","replies":[{"poster":"saphirraa","date":"2015-04-08T18:31:45.546+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"OK they didnt just feed they trolled and and went sion/cho bot after i already picked adc they literally trolled the game","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ligerzz","date":"2015-04-08T09:13:13.057+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"IDK. I always thought you should know at least 3 different roles, or how they work, to be able to reach at least higher elos like gold. Sure they are good at those two specific roles (support and marksman) but not all the time they are able to get the duo bot lane they planned for, which is why people going into ranked should practice other roles instead of their mains. It is very likely another person would want to go bot, and the duo themselves can't guarantee they are gonna get it every time, because of pick order.\n\n( I don't play ranked but i understand the general idea of it. Correct me if i'm wrong).","replies":[{"poster":"DreadPirateChris","date":"2015-04-08T15:01:41.887+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Sure, really you should be able to play any role because if you're last pick you have no control over where you'll go. That doesn't mean that people don't have main roles, and it's very likely that the duo's main roles are ADC and support. It's very likely the ADC's secondary role is support, and the support's secondary role ADC. Denying them the bot lane you're putting them onto a third or fourth role. Unless one of them goes into the jungle, they also won't be interacting with each other on the map until quite late in the game, making their (presumed by the MMR adjustment) voice comms ineffective.\n\nI absolutely agree, they -should- be able to play other roles, the OP or anyone else has every right to take his preferred role if he's earlier in pick order. However when you do that, don't expect people pushed into their worst roles in a higher MMR than they naturally have when queuing solo to be able to perform, and don't assume they are 'trolling' when they feed Fiora or Zed or some other champ that has easy 1v1 turret dives that make it dangerous even to farm under turret.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BluePolarizer","date":"2015-04-08T09:17:01.111+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"nope there's plenty of 1 trick ponies in diamond.

The reason is, the only reason duos work is because they have superior teamwork and communication. That's it.

In my experience one of the two is almost always lower or inferior in skill and is being carried into a match where they are far out classed. This means they are the weakest link by far on your team. It's not necessarily  their fault, but that's the nature of duo queing. \n\nMatch making isn't perfect by any means and anyone can have a bad game regardless of average skill level, but I tend not to trust most duo que players ax being equal to each other and the rest of the players in the match.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Peel Your ADC","date":"2015-04-10T01:33:11.966+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or don't gimp yourself by duoing in bot- the least dominant lane in the game.\n\nTake a solo lane and jungle and camp the shit out of your buddy.
