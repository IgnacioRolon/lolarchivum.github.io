Just won a game recently and when I checked my profile I see a yellow warning icon. Hovering over it, it says that I've lost too many games to maintain my rank but I'm currently shielded from getting demoted. Also says that winning more games will prevent me from becoming demoted. I can't find anything stated concerning demotion shield, except the one you get after going up ranks.\r\n\r\nSo does that mean that the system is about to boot me down to g1 or has it just not updated since my last win? I'm sitting at 18 lp and I was planning on taking a break until a next season bc of school but if I have to win more games to get this thing off I would like to know.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-18T00:18:34.475+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Those [**demotion shields**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204010760#h3q2) last for 3 games after you go up a division, but 10 games after advancing up a tier. You'll get them if you get promoted and drop quickly so that you don't go back and forth constantly.","replies":[{"poster":"jjanggae","date":"2017-10-18T17:17:22.253+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been in my rank for about a month and a half, more than 10 games definitely. This is clearly a different type of demotion shield. Wording is that I lost too many games to maintain rank. How exactly does this different demotion shield work.","replies":[]}]}]}
