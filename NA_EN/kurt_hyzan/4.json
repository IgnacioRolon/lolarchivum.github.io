That all of those skill shots can already be sidestepped.  The 1 click mobility skill is just an easy out for putting yourself in a bad position in the first place.  It is far more forgiving than casting skill shots.  When a mage casts a skill shot, majority of the time it is in the hands of the champ being shot at whether they are hit or not.  You should be dodging most of them already.  It is not 'outplaying', it is you being really bad if you get hit by them.  Most of them are telegraphed so heavily.  You don't see mages shouting 'outplayed' every time they land a skill shot.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ipressbutton","date":"2018-06-06T03:35:31.545+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"LC$ big plays","replies":[]},{"poster":"Glory97","date":"2018-06-06T10:44:39.886+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":3,"body":"To be honest I disagree. I main midlane and I have a lot of fun playing poke/skillshot mages. Sure there are some champions who struggle a lot ( {{champion:99}} {{champion:115}} {{champion:161}} ) against the mobile champions\nBut most mages are fine. Here are some tricks to hit more skillshots:\n1. Use your skillshots when they go for last hits. You can easily land your cassio q onto ekko during his aa-animation when last hitting a minion. 90% of the time the ekko will last hit, and not be able to use his e to dodge. If he cancels his aa to dodge, he can't get cs, allowing you to get cs advantages.\n2. Most dashes have quite long cd in early game. Most skillshots of mages have shorte cooldown, and you can use the time when their dash is on cd to your advantage.\n3. Play arround the enemies vision. It's ten times harder to dodge when the skillshots comes from fog of war. In teamfight use this to your advantage. Position yourself in bushes/behind terrain to make it harder to dodge your skills.\n4. take their possible ways to escape into consideration. Sometimes it's worth trying to predict to where the'll dodge.\n\nI even think that that a lot of mages have so reliable skillshots that it's already unfair for immobile champions, because of hard it is for them to dodge.\nFor example {{champion:103}} {{champion:69}} {{champion:34}} {{champion:268}} {{champion:134}} {{champion:142}} {{champion:101}} {{champion:65}} {{champion:50}}","replies":[{"poster":"Stars Shaper","date":"2018-06-06T11:18:19.605+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Xerath skillshots are all delayed, one needs to charge up, the other doesn't do any damage if not inside its bullseye, his stun is a projectile that stops on the first minion/summon hit and has no duration at close range and his ultimate spawns an enlarging red ring of death telling you exactly where to be in order to be safe and unless he lands 3+ shots you are not going to die (unless you were under 50% hp as a squishy).","replies":[{"poster":"Glory97","date":"2018-06-06T11:39:35.040+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"But Xerath q and w, combined with his passive allow him hard shove every wave at a quite efficient mana cost.
