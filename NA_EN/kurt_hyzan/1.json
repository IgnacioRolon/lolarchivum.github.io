As a Jhin main, here are my thoughts on this matter \n\n1) Rageblade + Jhin was only broken due to the fact of a bugged interaction between his passive and Rageblade passive, which was unintentional.\n\n2) IMO, tunes don’t make Jhin broken. You could take Dark Harvest, Electrocute, Fleet Footwork, Hail of Blades or practically any runs on him, and he’ll still do damage. So in my opinion, runes aren’t necessarily making him busted \n\n3) I agree, Jhin’s MS should be toned down per crit. \n\n4) Jhin is part of the problem, but not the main part. Storm Razor is. Before Storm Razor, Jhin could only crit on his 4th shot, unless he had crit items which only gave him a chance to crit and get his MS. Now, after the addition of Storm Razor, if he waits between shots he can crit repeatedly over and over and get tons of MS. IMO, while Jhin is also to be blamed in a certain way, Storm Razor is the main culprit as to why Jhin is busted \n\n5) People complain about Jhin’s AA range, but it’s literally only because of RFC. Meanwhile, other ADC’s like Caitlyn have a farther AA range than him, even without RFC. So...\n\n6) I’ve noticed how before Storm Razor was added into the game, practically no one thought that Jhin was broken or busted. Sure, there may have been the occasional post about him but nothing else really. Now, with Storm Razor added, and people discovering the potential of Storm Razor on Jhin, everyone is complaining about how “Jhin is so broken,” when literally it’s only because of Storm Razor...\n\nThose are just some of my thoughts on the matter, and you don’t have to agree with them","replies":[{"poster":"Kurt Hyzan","date":"2018-08-18T19:04:40.641+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Caitlyn is also bs with her burst damage (had some instances when I got 3 shot by Trap > Headshot E > Headshot > ult when the Cait only had {{item:3095}}) but at least if you reach her, you can delete her\n\nJhin issue on the other hand is that he can kite while still attacking, meaning he can stay at 500 units from you, and you just can't reach him because of the permanent movement speed boost","replies":[{"poster":"4G PnutCollida","date":"2018-08-18T19:06:43.454+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Kurt Hyzan,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=WkpQAT0b,comment-id=000a0000,timestamp=2018-08-18T19:04:40.641+0000)\n>\n> Caitlyn is also bs with her burst damage (had some instances when I got 3 shot by Trap &gt; Headshot E &gt; Headshot &gt; ult when the Cait only had {{item:3095}}) but at least if you reach her, you can delete her\n> \n> Jhin issue on the other hand is that he can kite while still attacking, meaning he can stay at 500 units from you, and you just can&#x27;t reach him because of the permanent movement speed boost\n\nYes.
