However my client was completely stable 2 days ago, the last time that I played, so I knew that it wasn't my computer was bad.. Turns out that windows 10 had auto updated recently and my problems came after that happened. I rolled back the update to a previous version, and wha la it worked. So if you can figure out how to do that, give it a try. It should work and you'll be back up and running like normal. \nHope this helps! :) \nCheers!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vexithen","date":"2016-10-18T13:34:42.096+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I still cannot fix it either.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-18T04:47:57.857+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bugsplats are typically the result of poor driver interactions or issues with your hardware.
