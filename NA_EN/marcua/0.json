The ability to have different abilities be available with different utilities make it extremely challenging and allows you to perform a different role every battle. Basically the invoker 3 normal abilities create an elemental charge and the ultimate changes based on what charges are up at that time. \n\nI also thought it would be cool to have a support type who increases damage damage based on the type of skill he uses while lowering other damage types. For example, if you used an ice attack ashe and sejuani's damage would be increased however you would lower an Annie's damage.
