The kind of champions like Nidalee, Lee Sin, Graves, Elise, Lucian, and Ahri seem to really embody my highly aggressive and high-risk/high-reward play style. Talon has become very simple and one dimensional since the game has evolved. With the assassin rework around the corner, where should we expect to see Talon?\r\n\r\nAs Dash would say, &quot;Will it jungle?&quot; And further, will his e be able to apply his passive to camps if he jumps into them over a wall? That would make him very viable in the jungle with the assassin counter-jungling item as well. Since it seems his passive would be pretty useless in the jungle without procing multiple passive stacks using abilites.. so unless your ulting camps that may be kind hard if his e doesn&#039;t have jungle interaction. Maybe I&#039;m looking at this the wrong, but nevertheless my 2 cents.","replies":[{"poster":"Shaydrox","date":"2016-10-20T20:34:50.812+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have played him quite a bit so far, and what I can tell is that he still kills squishies, but he lacks the initiating potential. Like, he's fun and cool, his burst is a lot more fair yet powerful if landed properly, but his ways of getting to a target are simply underpowered right now. His rework was awesome, but the balancing needs some more looking at.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Thebiggestpanda","date":"2016-10-20T20:03:57.482+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly he seems like a mobile bruiser to me with this rework. Unless you're just standing next to a wall so he can vault on you he pretty much has to walk up to people and use that obvious dash. Now this is just spit balling, but I'm betting hes gonna be played as a roaming juggernaut in the mid or top lane. This depends on his final numbers of course.","replies":[]}]}
