My name is Jake (ign Sc00psssssss). I've been playing on the fields of justice shorter (about a year) than you have but I just thought it would be nice if you do me a solid, maybe. I recently purchased some RP to buy a Shaco Skin (Masked to be exact) and I still have some RP left over. I saw that Jayce, a champ that I've had my eye on for awhile, is on sale this week but I'm 5rp off. I new that acquiring this RP would be no easy task so I drew Jayce to the best of my ability :). But, you are still the determining factor, you have to decide if this drawing is worth this 5rp! Thank you for Reading my lengthy babble and I hope you respond soon!\nEdit: Grammar \nEdit_2: They actually did it! :D Best support staff evar!","replies":[{"poster":"Fires of Justice","date":"2014-10-15T16:51:08.732+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Believe in the heart of the cards and power of friendship.","replies":[{"poster":"Hi Im Dude","date":"2014-10-15T17:11:30.263+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Believe in the heart of the cards and power of friendship.\n\nWhy does this sound like something you would hear off of my little pony lol","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Fires of Justice","date":"2014-10-15T16:18:16.093+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Sc00psssssss, that's an awesome drawing.
