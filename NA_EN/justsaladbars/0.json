Everyone is constantly flaming everyone for the smallest mistakes they make, calling them the N word, a c*nt, a f*g*ot, boosted apes (lmao) its just disgusting. The community is utter trash. I feel like theres no point even playing the game anymore. I wake up wanting to play league only to play a game where someone either feeds/afk's/reports you for no reason/is toxic. Its just a disgusting community and i dont wanna be apart of it. I think im gunna throw in the towel permanently. I like the game but the community has just ruined it. Ive seen so many toxic people get away with racism and stuff. Yet when i tell someone to shut up i seem to get punished for it. Its crazy. Well anyway, what are your thoughts on it ? \r\n\r\nNice playing with a few of you, the rest of you ruined it for me. Thanks ^^ \r\n{{champion:157}}","replies":[{"poster":"E420","date":"2019-08-09T00:19:16.277+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You seem to speak about a punishment, do you want to share your reform card with us (readers)?","replies":[{"poster":"JustSaladBars","date":"2019-08-09T00:25:13.792+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I dont have a recent one, i havent argued/instigated anything since my last chat restriction.

F2P Shooters are less toxic than this game but that's because they actually punish toxic players. Not slap them on the wrist and give them a little break to grab some food and drink.","replies":[]}]}
