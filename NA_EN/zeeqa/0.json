Basicaly my problem is the following: Since I plugged a wifi repeater or whatever its called to my plug next to my pc. Then my pc gets plugged to the repeater and a ethernet cable to my ethernet port. (obviously..) Only problem is league stoppes working. At least it disconnects me from the internet or the server. And what I mean with only is that every other game, like rocket league, counter strike etc.. they work fine I have 30 ping during the entire game. But with League when I connect, in the menu my chat and my game gets disconnected at random. Usually every 20-30 seconds. But my ethernet cable is still plugged in fine. Only league disconnects me from the server or from internet generally.. So I was wondering if its due to my firewall ? Which was fine until now I guess. Or due to something else.. \r\nI will try to turn off and on my firewall or whatever and repatch the game. \r\nLast resort is uninstalling and reinstalling the game I guess.\r\nThanks a lot.\r\nZeeQa {{champion:238}}","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-01T20:43:04.495+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It could very possibly be happening from some awkward firewall settings. Let's make sure to double check your [**network settings**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) as well, just in case you need to update a few things there too. Test those changes in a custom game and let me know if nothing seems to help.","replies":[]}]}
