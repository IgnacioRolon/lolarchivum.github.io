Its a Compaq Presario CQ6500y pc. The specs are:\r\nProcessor: AMD Athlon II 170u, Single Core, 2.0Ghz\r\nGraphics: Integrated for Nvidia Geforce 6150SE\r\nRam: 4gb\r\nHardDrive: 500gb\r\nOperating System: 64bit Windows 10\r\nI also think it's possible to add an Am3 compatible graphics card and may do so in the future. I am currently using a very old Toshiba laptop with all settings as low as humanly possible, and averaging 22fps early game, and 1 to 9 fps late game. Will this pc, without graphics card currently, run LoL better than the the laptop or above 30fps. I'm willing to put all settings to ultra low again. Thank you for your time and answers in advance.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-02T01:08:06.215+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It meets our [minimum system requirements](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752654-Minimum-and-Recommended-System-Requirements/#wq1), but I really can't speculate on how well League may run on this PC. I think that due to the integrated graphics and older hardware, it will run at low settings but I'm unsure of at what FPS it will run.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KillnYall","date":"2016-11-01T22:15:06.558+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes.
