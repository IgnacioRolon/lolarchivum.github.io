I need help with a problem I am having in game. When ever I play a game the becomes very laggy. Even when I have 50ms. The chat lags, the minions lag and the whole game is just laggy. I have never had this problem before. When searching for games it will now before I get into que say \"receiving data from server\". it has never said this before either. I am so confused. I don't know if it is the game (like should I just reinstall) or it is my internet. Please help me find the cause for this lag.","replies":[{"poster":"LEADlNG","date":"2016-08-08T05:16:00.365+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello, welcome to the forums and congratz on your first post in the support section haha!\n\nFrom what you've stated, this seems to be a connection related issue. When the client says \"receiving data from server\" more than normal, it is most likely taking awhile to ping data packets from where you are, back to where the game servers are located.\n\nTry the following:\n\n1. Adjust your in-game client video settings to minimal performance to help with FPS (Laggy frames).\n\n2. Turn your Router/Modem off for 20-30 seconds than reboot it back up and test if the ping is better in a custom game (Connection/Ping issue).\n\n3. Check any background programs running that may bring lag from unnecessary CPU usage (PC Cleaner programs).\n\n4. Try contacting your ISP about your internet plan and see if it's on there end.\n\n5. Try contacting Riot through the support ticket and see if it's on there end.\n\nSend Riot a support ticket here: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new","replies":[{"poster":"Hardly Average","date":"2016-08-11T05:15:49.043+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for the help.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-08T18:51:31.441+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The issues you're describing are consistent with a poor connection to the servers. When the client is experiencing a small drop in connection to the server, you'll see delays in stuff happening in game or \"receiving data from server\" popups in the client before a game. I recommend working through our [connection troubleshooting guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) for the most common solutions to these issues.\n\nShould you continue to see issues after working through those steps, let me know.","replies":[{"poster":"Hardly Average","date":"2016-08-11T05:14:58.676+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the help.","replies":[]}]}]}
