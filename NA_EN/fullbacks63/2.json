Everyone starts with 0. My sona build gives 15 AP and 8 Mpen from runes. No AP from masteries. At level 6, Q + powerchord with a frostfang deals 301 damage to a level 6 caitlyn bot with the base 30 MR and no runes/masteries which would reduce that when playing against someone real. At level 6, ADCs have around 900 hp. A third, as opposed to half, and you probably have a support who can heal or shield you to mitigate Sona's strongest damage point in the game.\n\nIt's good burst if you can call 300 max damage burst before autos, but this is also sona's last power spike in the game as the R passive and frostfang passive gives a good bit of flat bonus damage relative to her base. After this, her damage falls off hard unless she's aggressively buying AP items. 99% of sonas will be working towards sightstone around level 4-6 which gives no combat stats. She'll have decent damage from level 5 where she gets a third Q point to level 8-9 when Q is maxed. After that point, anything she kills will be leftovers from someone else since she isn't gaining AP outside of 30-50 from completed items at a slower rate than anyone but the enemy support.\n\nOutside the relatively good damage early game, her utility is only decent when her damage falls off. No one takes even 1 point in E until level 7. Mana used on heal before rank 2/level 4 is wasted mana. Her utility is what keeps her relevant from the 20 minute mark because her damage damn sure isn't.","replies":[{"poster":"fullbacks63","date":"2016-07-13T05:53:58.746+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1.

Braum has a shield that mitigates ALL incoming damage aimed at you when he's in front of you and gives bonus defense stats to boot. Lux has a shield but you don't really find her in a support role these days. Nautilus is also MIA in bot lane. Blitzcrank zones sona to 1000 range just by being blitzcrank. Zyra's stupid little plants make it very risky for a sona to try to harass. And don't pretend your support isn't usually a janna or soraka (janna's shield is about a second longer cd than sona's Q, but will mitigate the entire Q + auto and soraka is a guaranteed lost lane for sona).

Ez (and nunu and probably a few others I'm forgetting) have an AS buff for example, which while that doesn't make them good supports by themselves, it's just another thing to potentially be looking for when considering support viability. (By contrast, one should not be considering damage on a support, since they shouldn't be able to reliably get enough gold/xp to have a strong impact.)\n\nStill, I wasn't actually suggesting Ez was a strong support (I facerolled, but my normals mmr is a couple tiers below my ranked one), but more that damage from a support shouldn't really be a concern, since like most other champions played support, their damage will fall off greatly since they can't afford to build AP (or AD in the weirder cases) unless they get super fed. If you feel sona can chunk efficiently enough that her getting fed is inevitable, then someone like ez who is far burstier should be even more certain to be fed (and yet in both cases, they rarely actually do get fed unless theres a big skill mismatch).\n\nSona in particular is the 4th lowest base health champ at level 1 (lux, heimer, and anivia have less), and has just the one offensive move. People who know what they're doing versus her will see when her Q is down, and proceed to murder her when she can't really fight back. Lots of people just let sonas whittle them down, but if people actually fight her aggression, many sonas will be forced to play way back and go oom spamming their heal instead of poking.\n\nThat said, sonas getting tweaked a whole bunch this patch, so we'll see how she shakes out.\n\n\n(Also if you think thresh looks like a girl, then I don't know what kind of girls you know.)","replies":[]}]}]}]}
