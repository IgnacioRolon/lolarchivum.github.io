Hello guys. my name is  Marty.\nIm a noob silver player. With that said. Please note that im not the best when it comes to a number of things. But if anything I say makes seance  to you and can help improve your game then, I've done something right in creating this discussion.\n \nFirst off. TOP LANERS.\nI see you up there farming while someone your dueling goes mia. Your have two choices. Ether apply pressure. enough that poses a threat. Enough pressure that will make that mia riven come back top, or go help your team. Two choices alone. Your get that turret or show yourself in battle. With your team.\n\n I know they out farmed you and now that are going mia with all their free time. Learn to control your lane better and learn to show your face. U don't have to even fight when you go help your team. Just show riven your there.\n\nThe same exact thing can be said about mid. Get your turret.  Or go help your team.  Just please don't be farming by your turret while your team has to deal with your opponent . The rules of the game are 5  players against 5 players. Not 4 players against 5 players. If you show your face you will build Synergy and trust for your team. Show them your there. Show them you care about them.\n\nSecondly.  \ndon't go mia  to Get a kill when you are being outpushed in lane. Your loosing farm and you have your turret to take care of. Those are two good reasons not to mia. If you are out pushing the other player in lane be my guest, just make sure you recall first. \nThats vary important.\nmake the most of your farm before you go mia. Make your extra gold count. \nmake sure you have those items ahead of your opponent before u go mia or make any of those plays or your just wasting time  and risking the game.  \n\nSame can be said about bot lane. \n\nThe enemy team has bot turret and has dragon. And your freezing your lane. \nYou need to wake up bot lane and understand that when you loose your turret laning faze is over for you unless you can quickly secure your turret while the enemy team is away Or recalled. \nThe jungler should always help you quickly push the enemy teams turret down once u have  lost yours While they are recalled.\nSeason 5 is about pressure. Your going to loose unless you can keep up. Please be nice with your comments . Im using a tablet to write this so please so spelling police.","replies":[{"poster":"StOrmysLIVE","date":"2015-03-25T21:01:33.738+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the main thing to get out of silver is just purely game mechanics-\n\n1) not missing your skillshots\n2) estimating who wins in a trade\n3) how to use minions when fighting\n4) positioning in teamfights\n5) not overstaying/chasing\n\nThis is what I notice when playing with low elo players.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Saint XX","date":"2015-03-25T02:42:35.926+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm bronze, but I think this is very valid, cuz a lot of people (myself included) have trouble knowing \"when\" it's time to leave lane.
