Also, several hours is a n unacceptable turnaround for an issue like this. I understand these things happen and if it were only 10 or even 20 minutes, maybe even half an hour, I could understand. But I've been unable to play for over three hours now due to something on Riot's end, and when the only response is in forums saying it's \"rare\" and \"just wait\", it becomes incredibly annoying.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-21T02:37:22.763+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel ya man I do, but with situations like this the only way to fix it is to wait for the games to finally clear out. We do have people working overtime actually to see about speeding this process up, but these kinds of things can take a little bit of time. The issue doesn't seem to be too widespread at the moment, but searching for this exact issue is obviously going to bring up all of the results.\n\nI know this is incredibly frustrating for everyone involved, but trust that we're on the job trying to get this fixed and hopefully make things right with the amount of time it ended up taking.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"get r3kd","date":"2017-09-21T01:48:20.735+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it's been over three hours for me and I'm still stuck in a ghost game","replies":[]},{"poster":"ToriÃ¡","date":"2017-09-21T00:21:11.640+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yesss same","replies":[]},{"poster":"Very Childish","date":"2017-09-20T23:56:12.722+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I changed my passwords cuz thats what i thought","replies":[{"poster":"A Bagelle","date":"2017-09-20T23:57:30.709+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=HiIIary did ISIS,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=2HzFe2ae,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2017-09-20T23:56:12.722+0000)\n>\n> I changed my passwords cuz thats what i thought\n\n\n\nno other people are having this problem as well.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Very Childish","date":"2017-09-20T23:53:25.227+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"WTF","replies":[{"poster":"A Bagelle","date":"2017-09-20T23:55:53.611+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=HiIIary did ISIS,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=2HzFe2ae,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2017-09-20T23:53:25.227+0000)\n>\n> WTF is this some HAXOR","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"A Bagelle","date":"2017-09-20T23:52:10.255+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"same for me! it just says MF 10 mins etc","replies":[]}]}
