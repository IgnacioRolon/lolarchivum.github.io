I can't see any of my friends online, nor can I communicate with them. All I see is 'Unable to connect to chat, please try to reconnect manually' I press the button, but it doesn't work. Some of you may say 'send a support ticket' I've done this at least a dozen times with issues in the past, and Riot never solves my issues. Either they solve the issue on their own time(without admitting to me it was their mistake) or a friend of mine will find a solution(God bless those of you who are amazing at computers).","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-20T16:36:08.937+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you still having an issue?  It sounds like your network is failing to establish a connection to the chat servers, and resulting in that error.  I suggest going over each step of our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to fix this up for good, and prevent the error from recurring every so often.  This should get you fixed up!","replies":[]}]}
