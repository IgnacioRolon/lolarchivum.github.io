There are actaully enough OP champs that it&#039;s hard for one to get a crazy winrate in the 60% range because another OP champion or two is almost always on the enemy team.\n-A &quot;worrying trend&quot;: Heimerdinger, a champion almost specifically good at stomping SoloQ and only played by dedicated mains, is at 50.5% winrate.","replies":[{"poster":"Hayaishi2","date":"2015-11-16T04:59:35.131+0000","up_votes":60,"down_votes":10,"body":"\"OMG TANKS WILL BE UNVIABLE\" \n\nBoards overreacting as always.\n\nThe only thing that stopped tanks from being unkillabe was last whisper, now you build thornmail and some random armor item and adcs can't do shit.","replies":[{"poster":"A Miss Fortune","date":"2015-11-16T12:55:23.800+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":9,"body":"\"Mundo is unviable he's so easy to counter with 800g\"\n\ntfw 57% winrate","replies":[{"poster":"Sire Hippington","date":"2015-11-16T14:31:47.497+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":1,"body":"most likely cause people forget {{item:3123}} exists now.\nI had one game with a mundo so far, and he did nothing at all as two guys bought executioners...\n\nedit: played mundo one game my self, the teemo i faced top rushed liandrys, which is a poor item to rush vs mundo as i first go for mr rather than hp, and it only procs on his shrooms, and he didn't get morellos alo game long.\nBoth vayne and kindret couldn't find executioners in the shop(the only logical reason for them to not buy it, seeing that i and olaf hwere big problems in the midgame)\nonly their annie got morellos, and she usually died/run away befor i reached 40%...\n\nSo my assuption seems to fit, as i didn't face GW at all as mundo, and could literally go where mundo pleases duering midgame.\nLategame, i dropped rather fast(well, kinda to be expected vs kindret+vayne), but due to our vast advantage we could still close the game\nHowever, if that kindret would have had executioners, midgame would have bee a totally different thing, as i did really rely on that ult in order to stay alive and bait the opponents into our team while getting away with next to no health left...","replies":[{"poster":"Verxint","date":"2015-11-16T17:59:25.478+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's the fact that LDR and mortal reminder are shit items except in their ideal enviornments.\n\nIf you're being forced to buy one you lose overall damage output.","replies":[{"poster":"Auz the Ripper","date":"2015-11-16T18:46:14.086+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mundo _Is_ the ideal environment for mortal reminder, \nHe builds a good bit of armor and he relies on regeneration \nThe only way it could be more tailored against him is to let it combine with BotRK to make \"Mortal Blade of the Ruined Reminder King\"","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Calesvol","date":"2015-11-16T15:58:08.049+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":1,"body":"Also, a lot of people are slow at letting go of the TP meta.

Late game ADCs and AD assassins will melt you as a tank no matter how much defense you built. Obviously in a 1v1 scenario most ADCs would have trouble with a tank, but they should if they're in melee range. This is team game.\n\nThe only exceptions to this are like Rammus and Malphite (due to how their kits work). That or a VERY late game Sion, who pretty much transitions into a fighter if the game goes on too long. Most games don't last nearly long enough for that to happen though.

Defense itemization is cheaper (and saw the smallest price increases) and games will often end before champions finish more than two major items which will in most cases not included percent penetration.\n\n* Another reason for tanks being successful may be people picking all-AD teams.  Considering how well some of them synergize with the new masteries (Yasuo and Tryndamere with Warlord's Bloodlust, Devourer junglers with Fervor of Battle, etc), people seem to be spamming them in all roles with no regard for team composition.  Tanks can just stack armor items and crush them with little effort.\n\n* Thunderlord's Decree is currently bugged.  IIRC, it either shares a global cooldown for all champions on the same team or it's stacks will reset when a different champion with the mastery hits the target.  When they is fixed, the winrate of champions who take the mastery will likely increase.","replies":[{"poster":"LordGeovanni","date":"2015-11-16T06:30:38.409+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"considering that buying defense doesnt help you to farm. and maybe pick up kills in the most round about way some times if your enemies brain dead (no offense to anyone) but buying ad and ap does and ap items and mr items are just about on par with each other with ap still being slightly stronger and having a way to by pass some mr and ap on spells helps you to farm and pick up kills with you on the initiative.\nand ad helps you to farm and pick up kills too. ad was brought down closer to armor slightly but any one that uses crit was brought up farther away from armor users that they already out classed and a vast majority of them out ranged. with more penetration items agumented damage life steal (healing) and mana regain on crits which would happen every 3 seconds with the bit of crit only to get faster also can heal large amounts every time you get a crit. crit users want for nothing but a built in healing cleanse oh wait isnt that Gangplank.","replies":[{"poster":"Kuroi86","date":"2015-11-16T08:56:06.992+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":">considering that buying defense doesnt help you to farm\n\nThis is rarely a concern for tank mains.
