The new LW only affects Bonus Armor... And you'll max at 47% with it. IF you have a FH and a Thornmail, for a bonus of 190 and you have a base of 70, you're at 260. CURRENTLY, LW will bring that 260 down to 158.6. With the new LW (The full item, not the LW itself) you'll have 170.7. That's a 12 more armor than you currently get and that's if they have the full LW finished and IF your champion had 70 base armor. \n\nFor example, Xin gets up to 85 base. Current LW would make it to where he goes to 51.85. That's about a loss of 33 armor. The new LW WON'T TOUCH THAT. That 33 will stay there. 85 base armor is also 46% reduction. That's 46% that won't be affected by a LW. They'll HAVE to get an armor shred item, which with their builds, they can't afford to trade any of their items for a Youmuu's or Cleaver, which means they'll have to worry about their teammates doing such a thing.\n\nThere's also BotRK being nerfed from 8% to 6%, so tanks only have Kog and Vayne to fear (Vayne is being buffed to 12% true damage at the cost of the flats, something everyone and their mother has been wanting for... some reason... I mean, that 4% on a 2k health ADC is 80 damage when the flat used to be 60. Loss of damage mid game to get more late I guess? I dunno. People said they wanted it this way and Riot delivered) since Vayne does %health True Damage and Kog's W now has an AD scaling on top of doubling his AS and doubling the 2.5 AA per sec cap to 5 per sec.","replies":[{"poster":"LankPants","date":"2015-10-31T11:48:59.343+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">What..? The new LW only affects Bonus Armor... And you'll max at 47% with it.\n\nYou're looking at the wrong half. +15% damage against high HP champs.\n\nAny champ who builds armour is going to have at least one HP item, meaning you're going to have +500 HP on them and they get 15% bonus damage against you.\n\nI've played this out on the PBE from both sides. I can tell you tanks are incapable of tanking on the PBE. The 3 ADC comps will melt you in a second flat even with 300+ armour. ADCs are so strong on the PBE that they don't need BotRK to melt tanks. (not that they ever did, IE's always hurt tanks more) \n\nMerc Scimitar is ludicrous, it basically allows ADCs to completely ignore tanks, the MR and lifesteal make their damage irrelevant and the CC cleanse means you can't CC them down.\n\nLord Dominik's Regards punishes building every single tank item in the game. You lose 40% of the value from any armour you buy and any HP you buy makes you take more damage from the ADC. To make it even worse the components for this item are also incredibly powerful. You can just sit on you 1300 30% armour pen item, you kind of just buy it when you have gold and as long as the enemy has one armour item it's incredibly efficient, same goes for Giant Slayer but for HP instead of armour.\n\nAlso you mentioned masteries, have you seen how crazy the ADC ones are? Sure tanks have a decent one, 8% damage reduction is nothing to laugh at, but it's honestly not as good as two of the ADC masteries. Warlords Bloodlust is utterly absurd, heal for 15% of a crits damage and gain 20% attack speed, I think it's honestly the strongest mastery right now. Slightly less talked about and a bit more situational but Fervour for Battle can get insane. When it's fully stacked it deals 80 on hit Phys damage to each auto. If you keep this stacked it's greater than the 8.8ish% bonus damage you need to overcome 8% resist.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"HentRex","date":"2015-10-31T07:22:40.827+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fiddlesticks falling even farther out of viability.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-10-31T11:17:46.602+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, considering LW only affect bonus armor now and most tanks have about 70 (Sion) to about 104 (Rammus, with Braum at 103 behind him) which is about 40-50% damage reduction that can't be affected by the LW and has to be reduced via Kog's, J4's, or Wu's Q or a Cleaver since I believe even Darius's E is being changed to only affect bonus as well. You'll need flat ArP or % reductions to eat away at a tank's innate armor while a LW might ignore almost half of the bonus armor. \n\nI should note even squishy champs like Ahri have a base of 80 armor, which is around 45% reduction. Yeah. AD champs actually got boned unless they start used Youmuu's and the 19 ArP from runes, plus there's the 8ish you can get from Masteries. \n\nSooooo.... Yeah. While every single AD item took a nerf in AD like IE and ER lost 15 AD, Bt lost 5, BotRK lost 2% current health, Shiv is 50-150 now so a ton less damage when finished and a little more later on, all the AD items are over 3k, so they'll be the same cost as the AP equivalents... I mean, overall... All they did was put AP items on par with AD. They bumped up the cost of a lot of AD items while nerfing a lot of the high cost ones.","replies":[{"poster":"kasfas","date":"2015-10-31T14:31:20.724+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Says sion has 70 base armour, my reaction: \"WTF?!?!

Really sion should rely on his W passive to get more hp, making resistance stacking better. Don't get me wrong, I know that he needs to build SOME health(in the forms of visage, rands, banshees, and less effective yet still very viable: dmp, warmogs, and sunfire), but should spend more time resistance stacking, again because he gets free hp. You SHOULD come out of laning with between 200 and 400 hp (the former being the very minimum, the latter being for pretty good csing sions) and if your playing right, should end the game with 600+ (that includes kills and assists. the more they die, the more free farm you get as well as the 10 for killing them).

That's it. Trist and Varus HATE that item. Varus is a poke-based ADC who actually prefers to go more caster build and poke with his Q as we saw all throughout the season and even in World's. Varus was made to use his AA's as a last line of defense sorta thing, hence why he's got 575 range, not 600+ when his kit is all long range stuff. \n\nADC's also can not just sit on their incomplete items. All the items have their strength on completion with the addition of a bonus effect, just like all the AP items give like BF sword is 40 AD for 1.3k just like Needless is 1250 for 60 AP and such. AD's form of Fiendish is 1.1k, so they have to pay more there... etc. etc.\n\nOnly items that are less than 3k though are the three AS/Crit items. These items are the equivalent of the CDR items for AP, which are 2550 for nomicon and 2.8k from Athene's, about the same price as the AS/Crit items. Both serve the purpose of enhancing the large AD/AP items you buy before or After. Most AD's can't rush their AS/Crit item like an AP can rush either big damage or CDR and mana regen, with the exception of Kog and Vayne who are currently scary as hell since Vayne lost her flat true damage, but she does 12% of some one's max health rather than 8% and Kog's W has an AD scaling on top of doubling his AS (And AS cap). Those two are different though...\n\nBuuuut yeah. Giant Slayer is decent, but doesn't help against squishies if you're a level above the enemy or ahead in any way. \n\nI should also note, ADC's aren't even getting the better components. AD Assassins are getting the better components with getting two really good items, Youmuu's and Death's Deal. Both have incredible build paths now with 65 AD (On par with IE and Essence) plus giving 65 AD with Youmuu's giving 20 ArP to help kill squishies AND tanks (Tanks because LW only affects the bonus armor, so you NEED flats or % REDUCTION to get through their 70 (Sion) -80 (Standard AP's like Ahri) - 103/104 (Braum/Rammus) base armors.).","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Canastus","date":"2015-11-01T12:03:10.854+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:69}} is going to be even more useless than she already is. \n\nShe always was a worse version of a marksman, now she'll be entirely outclassed in every sense with her inferior sustain and unreliable play pattern, also her items are going to suck aswell.
