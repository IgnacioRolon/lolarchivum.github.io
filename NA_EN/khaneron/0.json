Installation seems to work fine, but when I attempt to run/patch the game, it causes my entire computer to crash after about 5-10 minutes. I've tried reinstalling, using various versions of the installer, running in compatibility modes, running as administrator, and regardless of what I do, my computer still locks up and has to be restarted a few minutes after I start League. Any idea on what the problem is or how I might fix it?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-04T22:37:23.572+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What do you mean when you say your entire computer is crashing?  Does it shut down?  What do you see?  Are there error messages?  Have you updated your OS, assuming it's Windows?

This freezing is an issue we've seen for some players after a Windows 10 update.  It auto-enabled the [Xbox Game Bar](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html) which has caused freezing and fps issues in some cases.  Disabling this may do the trick!","replies":[{"poster":"Khaneron","date":"2017-03-07T17:06:28.955+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm still having problems with the League client freezing, though I've narrowed things down a bit more. The beta client causes a freeze pretty rapidly after logging in, and using the legacy client while the beta client's installed will do the same thing, just after a slightly longer period of time. Trying again with a fresh install without ever installing the beta client seems to be working slightly better.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-07T17:41:14.361+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like something like a driver could be degrading and eventually failing.
