The fact is 90% of community is really toxic, this was shown by the recent icon rewards given out.On my main, I was 14-day banned twice in 5 months duration and I still managed to get 2 icons out of 5. The thing is perma-ban for flaming is not a solution, Riot just wants to cash up money so that people who get account banned spend on the new one's. Of-course flaming new people is bad that is why keep it implemented for normals/ARAM, but Riot should keep the flame bans away from Ranked, where people want to try hard and expect others to do their best too.","replies":[]}]}
