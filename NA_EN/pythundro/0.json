In the games it happens that the game freezes a few seconds (the champs are like floating around and their hp goes down in fight). I wonder if the problem is actualy in the patch and Riot will fix it somehow or is the problem at me.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-13T20:50:28.150+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your network is having trouble maintaining a connection, and ends up cutting you off since the game requires a constant connection.  As a first step, I recommend using our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide for the fix.
