Not permanently only 2 weeks. But just to clarify I&#039;m very very confused on my insta ban. To get started I have been toxic and will not deny that as I&#039;m a hardstuck plat and I haven&#039;t really been toxic outside that. Out of the 3 years I&#039;ve been playing this game I&#039;ve only been chat restricted a few months ago. After the chat restriction I got really afraid so I decided I was too toxic and reformed. After a while I got my privileges back and got a level 3 honor level. I was pretty happy until one of my days I was on a big losing streak and really had a bad day so you know where this went. I was not racist was not wishing for someone to get a disease or making death threats I just kept complaining about feeding teamates. Long story short after my toxic game I had to take a break to clear my mind. When I came back I was instantly banned for 14 days no chat restriction or anything.  So after this I sent a ticket and here&#039;s the what went down.\n\nMe: I&#039;m very confused on why I am instantly banned for 14 days after receiving no chat restriction or warning. I thought there are levels of this and I find it a bit unfair other players get chat restriction whilst I get an instant ban. I was at the honor level of 3 and I dunno if they changed the tribunal system but I have not received any sort of punishment due to toxicity in a very long time. I even thought I was clear because I got promoted to level 3 honor system. Any help please.\n\nRiot Guy: The 2 week suspension was placed on your account because of recent in-game behavior which created a negative experience for other players. In cases where the toxicity exhibited is too high, some of the punishment levels can be skipped. For the specific chat logs which led to the ban please log into the client where you can view your reform card.\nWe will not be lifting the suspension due to the negativity observed but I do have some tips you can use to avoid future bans:\n\nMe: What do you mean toxicity is &quot;too high&quot;. There is not a set level for toxicity unless it goes from toxic to racist. How can you skip 2 levels of punishment for me, a player who&#039;s been playing for years and have been clean for years until recently but leave new people or people in bronze who have been more consistently toxic. You guys are misleading and I find this extremely unfair. There&#039;s even a whole section about why chat restriction is good right here: http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/player-behavior/player-behavior-design-values-punishment . You guys said &quot; we only utilize it (punishments) in very specific circumstances&quot; while this specific circumstance is chat toxicity; not scripting, not leaving games but toxicity. I have been toxic and I admit to it but you don&#039;t give one person a different treatment than another. I don&#039;t see someone getting banned because they leave the game. They get a leaverbuster just as I should get a chat restriction. I don&#039;t get you why discriminate my account above everyone else&#039;s. I have been supporting the game for years and actually spent real life money on it. From this statement I do not want a praise or anything like that, I just want u to treat my punishment the same as everyone else&#039;s.\n\nRiot Guy: We are not singling you out, we treat everyone in the same way. That being said, calling your teammates &quot;retarded&quot; in multiple games i snot acceptable and this suspension will not be lifted nor modified.\n\nSo long story short I&#039;m still in a conversation with him but I don&#039;t think he&#039;ll be explaining it well as the Riot Guy is only replying with short vague sentences. I&#039;m not saying I don&#039;t deserve a punishment or anything like that i&#039;m just wondering how come I don&#039;t get a 5 or 20 game chat restriction while others have; also where&#039;s the 1 day 1 week bans. Why instantly 2 weeks. Plus I don&#039;t think calling someone &quot;retarded&quot; is in the same level of saying their family should die of (a disease) or a racist slur or whatever.","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2017-09-03T14:54:51.889+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's possible that your behavior had not yet completely cleared the preexisting punishments from your account -- they can take a while to clear out depending on your in-game behavior.\n\nWithout seeing the chat logs it's hard to say more.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Splatyo","date":"2017-09-04T05:39:01.056+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"you can get perma banned from saying you suck 0/3 every 5 minutes. so like 5:00 you suck 0/2 10:00 you suck 1/4 15:00 you suck so on. you can and WILL get PERMA BANNED FOR THAT, it's just ridiculous. while you could play a game for 5 minutes. and leave it. constantly and not be punished with a perma ban","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-09-03T13:28:29.787+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh, is calling people retarded escalating punishments now? I haven't heard anything about that but I really hope it is true.\n\nCan you post your chat logs so we can see if there is anything in them that would lead to an escalation? And keep in mind there are only two levels of chat restriction before the 14 day suspension normally, so if you had a 10 game and 25 game chat restriction your next punishment would be a 2 week ban. Slightly vague based on your post.","replies":[{"poster":"TrulyBland","date":"2017-09-04T03:33:50.133+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"At the very least calling people retarded is considered very negative. And even though hate speech is the most common way to skip to a 14-day ban, iirc it is actually possible to skip tiers just by being *extremely* toxic without using classical \"trigger words\".","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Stay Close Dear","date":"2017-09-03T14:30:18.212+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"From what i know words like \"retarded, autistic, any sort of sexual/ racial slurs (n word and f word are like an insta ban lol) aswell as anything death related are treated more severely than any other insults and can get you to skip ban tiers.
