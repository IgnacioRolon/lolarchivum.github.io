In the client certain runes aren't re-appearing over in the runepage dropdown so I can't put them on any pages that didn't already have them saved. Store shows that I own them already, and the pages that do have them saved from the old client still have them and they work in game. Also, if I go to one of the pages and remove them they don't return to the dropdown either, so it definitely seems to be a problem with a couple specific types of runes. Because when I remove other ones like attack speed reds for example, they do show up in the dropdown.\n\nWent ahead and tested it to see which ones weren't reappearing on the left in my client for you as well. Here.\nattack speed quints, attack damage reds, flat armor yellows, and both flat/scaling magic resist blues\n\nThe only thing I can think of that these particular runes had in common were that they were the only ones used in my first two built in pages, as opposed to the other optional add-on ones.","replies":[]}]}]}
