I think background image is selected by your most recently played champions.  Technically, it looks like yours is Thresh but is showing as Lee Sin.  I recommend reporting this over at the [client discussion](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/alpha-client-discussion) boards in case this is a bug.
