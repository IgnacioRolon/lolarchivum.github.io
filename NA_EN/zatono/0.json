She has  no cc as it stands save the little knockback from the ult... which is a little counter-intuitive. She SHOULD be tanky for her team to dive in. But if your tank is flanking to knock the enemy into the team... then a chunk of y our front line is gone and the back line is more exposed. I could be wrong about that. But it's a pain to initiate dragon form and then have the enemy kite back while you're team watches trying to catch up. For counter initiation the knock back doesn't feel like enough peel if the fight started with the other team initiating since there are so many dive champs now. Not dive champs in META.. just dive champs. However, wall stun knockbacks could be great counter initiation and or just poor position punishment. Like fighting a rumble or Gnar in the jungle. I dunno.","replies":[]}]}
