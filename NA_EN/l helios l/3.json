The word invokes a sense of retribution for misconduct to some discipline, which Illaoi sees herself as the &quot;educator and enlightener.&quot;\r\n\r\n&gt; I am a teacher. Bilgewater will learn. \r\n&gt; They must be tested to grow.\r\n\r\nLashes are a former of penitence for one who would follow a religious code, ex. self-inflicted lashings were common way back when. So it would make sense that Illaoi&#039;s tentacles &quot;lash&quot; her foes to punish them for not following Nagakaboros&#039;s commands like she does. That same sort of emotion and depth doesn&#039;t exist with &quot;slam.&quot; It just sort of feels like, &quot;hey the tentacle slams down. Let&#039;s call it a slam attack.&quot;\r\n\r\nImo, calling them &quot;lashes&quot; evokes that sort of religious overtone that Illaoi radiates, and it&#039;s a very appropriate one to help demonstrate her character as opposed to &quot;slams.&quot;","replies":[{"poster":"Reaper Review","date":"2016-06-13T19:24:01.702+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"_\"I'm not big on sermons.

Lash had some good associations. Slam captured the raw strength and power vibe appropriate for Illaoi better though, versus the more whip like connotations of Lash.\n\nSome additional perspective: \n\nIn the literal gameplay sense, Illaoi targets a ground location with her tentacles, not an enemy. She is slamming the ground, not lashing it -- if her abilities were unit-targeted, lash may have been more appropriate. \n\nAlso, punishment isn't Illaoi's goal. She teaches through brutal, mostly physical adversity. Penitence and punishment revolve around atonement, meaning that some grievance needs to be paid for. Illaoi doesn't care about mistakes, \"sins\" or even justice. Her instruction preaches strength and the rejection of stagnation or passivity.","replies":[{"poster":"JavelinJoe","date":"2016-06-15T04:44:31.538+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But her E functions way more like a whip than a smashing/slam ability.
