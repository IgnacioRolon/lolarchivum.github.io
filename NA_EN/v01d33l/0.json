This can be made Unique Passive which if both items are purchase only 1 Active is proc'd and both will consequently go on CD.\n\nThis is why I&#039;m asking why doesn&#039;t QSS build into AP or even Tank/Defensive item?

Really not asking for much.

If you&#x27;re winning you build it to become completely unkillable no matter what.\n\nConsidering Im a midlane mage and AP enchanter support main, this only speaks of the irony of just how bias against AD and bias towards AP _you_  actuallyare.\n\nI don't know what i was thinking trying to have any reasonable discussion with a guy that thinks a stupid magic shield is comparable to a literal invincibility button, and has the audacity to claim that just because he is boosted enough to press it every time he is low AP and caught out , basically using it for no reason other than to waste everyone's time, it makes it a bad active. it's looney ad I quite frankly don't have the time for that.\n\nMerely having Zhonyas in your inventory basically hard counters every AD assassin in the game.\nit is so potent that I have even build it on ADC just to screw Over Zeds.\n\n_But no. The extra 250 HP that was blocked from Lifeline daring to deny you a kill is far more op. Yes makes sense. _\n/sarcasm.\n\n","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"V01D33L","date":"2017-01-28T02:12:55.268+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"{{item:3157}}  doesn't stop suppression.

ADs have convenient access to an item that removes CC.\nAPs have easier access to a literal invincibility button.\n\nThese are pros and cons of beign AP and AD. The two need not be homogenized.\n\n\n>Also it&#x27;s a double-edge item similar to {{item:3026}} where if your team abandons you or the team forces them away from you while your active comes off, it&#x27;s detrimental instead of life saving.\n\n- in this post, poor use of an active results in horrible situations and outcomes.\n\nyes, im aware.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
