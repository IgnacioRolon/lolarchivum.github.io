I wanted to test out some of the assassin reworks so I patched up my PBE account and tried to log in but it said my username/password was invalid. I've tried every password I've ever used. Also, when I try to sign up for PBE again, it says \"Get to Testing!\" I also cannot log into the PBE website. I'm not sure what the problem is. Help please?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-26T23:32:52.183+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I recommend reaching out to our account specialists in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to recover this PBE account.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions.","replies":[]}]}
