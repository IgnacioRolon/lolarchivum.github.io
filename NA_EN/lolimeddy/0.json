The mouse would not move outside of the corner meaning I couldn't change resolution settings and command tabbing didn't seem to fix the problem. I have exited client, restarted my computer but the bug still remains.

If you're on a Mac, tapping Alt+Enter in-game can serve as workaround by switching you to windowed mode.  Hopefully, this will help until we get a more permanent fix.
