This doesn't have anything to do with timezones.\n\nFrom 00:00 to 11:59 AM is a 12-hour AM (before midday) period and 12:00 to 23:59 is the 12-hour PM (after midday) period. Of course it's not a mistake to just use the 24-hour period clock if that's easier for you. Analog clocks (wrist watches, wall clocks, etc.) usually tell time in 12-hour periods too.\n\nTimezones are different.\nTimezones divide the whole globe in segments, _**theoretically**_ in 24 parts (1 hour per timezone). But in reality, there are timezones that are 30 or 45 minutes apart so there's more than 24 but we don't need to be concerned about that.\n\n**PDT** is the timezone in which Riot is situated at, which means **Pacific Daylight Time**.\nTimezones are oriented around **UTC** which stands for **Coordianted Universal Time**.\nTimezones are also written like this \"PDT (UTC -7)\" which means \"from UTC, PDT timezone is seven hours behind\".\n\nMy country is in the CEST (UTC +2) timezone (Central European Summer Time) which means that, combining it with PDT (UTC -7), Riot's 7 hours behind but we're 2 hours ahead of UTC.\n**In total, CEST is 9 hours ahead of PDT.**\n---\n\nRiot does convert their time in your local client's time but for this announcement, it just says \"begins in 17/10\" without a specific time so many people just expected to log in at exact date and start getting the rewards.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Byakuya Ji","date":"2019-10-17T13:59:44.757+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":5,"body":"> BST PDT CEST\nit does nothing but cause confusion.\n\nwhat country? because every country has a timezone","replies":[]},{"poster":"No Quarter","date":"2019-10-17T17:18:23.487+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":29,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Aiakoss","date":"2019-10-17T17:24:56.372+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"We all are Homo Sapiens...","replies":[{"poster":"RadioactiveFishy","date":"2019-10-17T17:31:20.777+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"He did say \"at it's first phase.\" What's more interesting is the \"fuck fucking fucks\" lol","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Miljuss","date":"2019-10-17T16:53:08.709+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"do u lsd?","replies":[{"poster":"dencja123","date":"2019-10-17T17:46:27.443+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Chuckleteeth","date":"2019-10-17T18:38:06.021+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"And also very dangerous if abused.\n\nBe safe.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"MrCatling","date":"2019-10-17T16:19:17.186+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"germany?","replies":[{"poster":"Chodící Deprese","date":"2019-10-17T16:24:59.055+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MrCatling,realm=EUW,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=gxrlQZV7,comment-id=000c00010007,timestamp=2019-10-17T16:19:17.186+0000)\n>\n> germany?\n\nhttp://letmegooglethat.com/?q=13%3A00+PDT+in+germany {{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ToEasY4Me","date":"2019-10-17T19:25:05.596+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Antenora,realm=EUW,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=gxrlQZV7,comment-id=000c,timestamp=2019-10-17T09:24:32.810+0000)\n>\n> The daily mission spawns at 13:00 PDT which is 21:00 for EUW or 22:00 for EUNE.\n\n22:24 still no missions dude","replies":[]},{"poster":"IIIYoyoIII","date":"2019-10-17T12:21:09.099+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":2,"body":"das kinda stupid that its not dependant on region","replies":[]},{"poster":"NaSaNG","date":"2019-10-17T16:45:43.418+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"cool so eune basically has like 2 hours to login vs 12 for na cooooll","replies":[{"poster":"TyRamos","date":"2019-10-17T17:17:37.812+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=NaSaNG,realm=EUNE,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=gxrlQZV7,comment-id=000c0008,timestamp=2019-10-17T16:45:43.418+0000)\n>\n> cool so eune basically has like 2 hours to login vs 12 for na cooooll\n\nwrong, theyve said they won't make you lose out on the gifts if you miss a day.","replies":[{"poster":"Long Gone","date":"2019-10-17T17:24:22.986+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"i like that \"wrong, \", you sound like dwight from the office lmao","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Daddy Ants","date":"2019-10-17T16:56:10.629+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=NaSaNG,realm=EUNE,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=gxrlQZV7,comment-id=000c0008,timestamp=2019-10-17T16:45:43.418+0000)\n>\n> cool so eune basically has like 2 hours to login vs 12 for na cooooll\n\nNo?\n\nI saw somewhere the missions last for 30 days","replies":[{"poster":"PeeKayU","date":"2019-10-17T17:59:52.135+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wait, they're gonna be missions?

On many other games rewards are sent depending on the region you are on, independent from other regions. I don t get it why we need to wait that long it s ridiculous. Each region should have a specific time or make it be the same time in all regions like 10 AM for example in all regions instead of releasing an event globally regardless the time across multiple regions because for some regions will be late AF.","replies":[{"poster":"Mâster Yisus","date":"2019-10-17T13:17:35.245+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":4,"body":"I totally agree.
