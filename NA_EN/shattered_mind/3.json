Whilst the promises of balance keep coming it seems they are getting farther away.\r\n\r\nMord still hasnt been balanced. He can 1v5. One shot everyone nearly including the tank.  No he was not fed. He did not rack up kills until the last idk 10 minutes of the game and most surely the last 3 minutes.\r\n\r\nGalio just got a mega buff on his Q and it is broke and this has be more or less confirmed by a Riot from one of my other post. That rioter said they will closely monitor this over the weekend.  Like seriously why wasnt this found in testing its not like its hidden.  I am starting to wonder if this is done on purpose.\r\n\r\nNaturally there is a slight rage in this because this \"micropatch\" 7.21 happen between when I got to work and than got off. I lost a 7 game streak, 5 of which were in ranked.  Yes yes \"youre just bronze' but considering how bronze is, gaining one tier-- I.E. B3 to B2 - is a hurdle.\r\n\r\nI feel as if some items dont have any use. like for example I go against a tank therefore i get {{item:3036}} , if its a tank that heals i would get {{item:3033}} .  \r\nI research how to deal with certain situations and apply that in game and yet it fails to work. \r\n\r\nAnyway. I believe Riot doesnt deserve my money and would like a portion of it back.  I say a portion because I understand people have to eat.Though my measly $600+ wont be much to a multi million dollar company. \r\n\r\nThanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-26T16:43:54.182+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry to hear your experience hasn't been the best.  :(  Our devs strive to tune the game each patch, and listen to your feedback through the boards as well as Ask Riot.
