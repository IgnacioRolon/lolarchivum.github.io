I read the event page on the website and it said that missions were updated every 24 hours at 11am, but I still have no new missions. Didn't think you had to buy the pass in order ( no pun intended ) to get more missions. Could just be a little behind but I would appreciate some feedback thank you. **:)**","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-06-16T17:52:17.541+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But it's not 11am yet.  :x  It's in pacific time and aimed to refresh around that time, so you gotta hang on just a little bit longer.","replies":[]}]}
