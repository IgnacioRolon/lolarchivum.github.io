Currently four out of nine Shadow isle champs are jungler's ({{champion:28}} {{champion:60}}{{champion:120}} {{champion:57}}) and three of those four are currently geared so heavily towards jungling that they don't get much love for playing on lane({{champion:60}} {{champion:28}} and somewhat {{champion:120}} )","replies":[{"poster":"Zenthon Prime","date":"2015-05-02T22:59:05.825+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, if you look at her original concept and spotlight she was supposed to be a mage/assassin like Nid (although more geared towards in-your-face %HP burst than spamming BS spears until you get a hit).

Average skills on mages bounce around 1%:3.5AP or 1%:4AP, in contrast. She also has more sources of AP power than most mages (2 Q's, Human W, Spider W sustain, Spider AA, Spiderling AA). Her issue is that it's next to impossible to land all of it on a mobile target, even with a landed cocoon. Assassins need to land their skills, and that's next to impossible most of the time on Elise, especially during a teamfight.\n\nThe percent damage and sustain ratios are actually why she was so good as an AP bruiser. She was quite good at shredding tanks as long as she could stand up to them. However, with tanking becoming less and less viable, she's been like a fish out of water, as she needs a bit of AP + tankiness to be viable. Going for both makes her far too non-tanky for the League at the moment.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Pæan","date":"2015-05-02T20:12:36.267+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"The thing about elise is when she is strong,  she is too strong compared to other junglers.\nwhen she is weak, she isn't even worth playing, even if she is a favorite champ of mine.\ntry playing full AP assassin, or just go cinder hulk, rylais,  liandry's,  then full tank and be a shredder that can clean up but still be really tsnky.\n\nRight now I feel like she is just a semi-tanky cocoon bot :/","replies":[{"poster":"Abyssphere","date":"2015-05-02T21:04:08.148+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":4,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Paean,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=GnEyXOFm,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-05-02T20:12:36.267+0000)\n>\n> The thing about elise is when she is strong,  she is too strong compared to other junglers.\n> when she is weak, she isn't even worth playing, even if she is a favorite champ of mine.\n> try playing full AP assassin, or just go cinder hulk, rylais,  liandry's,  then full tank and be a shredder that can clean up but still be really tsnky.\n> \n> Right now I feel like she is just a semi-tanky cocoon bot :/\n\nShe could easily be buffed to the level of Lee Sin.
