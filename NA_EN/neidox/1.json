When I scale the game to 2k it looks so good, the only problem is the cursor shrinks to a size where its difficult for me to follow it. IS there a way to keep the cursor from scaling? I noticed when I scaled back to 1080 the cursor would become larger and more noticeable.","replies":[{"poster":"ThesonofShiva","date":"2017-03-26T19:19:12.480+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This game is so bad, HOW HAVE THEY NOT FUCKING FIXED THIS YET???  and I try to do a test game with bots, and its going to give me a penalty for leaving a game with no rewards and bots. man fuck this game so hard.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-15T18:18:58.038+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can run into problems when scaling over 1080, and you'll currently see this in screens like 4K because it's not officially supported yet.  You may notice your cursor change especially when tasking in and out of game as well.  Your best bet for now would be to reduce your resolution back to before.  Hopefully that will do the trick!","replies":[]}]}
