I get a cool 14-19ms in Overwatch, shit is tight. However in league I'm at an awkward and uncomfortable 72-80. That may not seem terrible to you but everything is a hair-trigger in this game. So serious question, is this normal for Riots servers? Its pretty janky if it is. Probably won't be seen anymore since I had to move it to this section.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-10T19:25:11.424+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you are getting sudden high ping like this then you could be having packet loss.

League is the only thing I have not seen improvements on. I bought the extender specifically for League. Any tips would be greatly appreciated.","replies":[]}]}]}
