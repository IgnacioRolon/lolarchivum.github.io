Why does one player get to steam roll a team, solo push a whole lane, and pretty much just auto attack to victory. \r\n \r\n  The worst part is they aren&#039;t even squishy.

If you look at all the current Devour users that are dedicated junglers and played long enough you'll know that none of them even needed Devour or for Sated to be added and had other options aside for 1 champion. Warwick is the only champion that has historically not built anything else other than in rare cases (such as building Golem/Cinder but tank Warwick was nerfed due to him being nerfed for Devour), all the other devour users only use devour when it is the best option and they aren't even balanced around devour anyways.\n\nWarwick, again, is the only one balanced around it. Yi was building Warrior until it was clear Sated out classes it, Shyv was buffed due to using Cinder but once it was clear Sated outclasses Cinder people started using it which now means she has to be nerfed ruining Cinder/tanky Shyv. Xin originally also used Warrior until Sated was added to Devour. Udyr has already been shown to function fine with Cinder and even now Echoes. There is no reason for the item to exist other than for Warwick, but even then, he's being changed and could be changed in a way to be fine without it.
