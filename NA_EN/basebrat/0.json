One involved the auto attack animation not playing during my 2nd and 3rd attack, he would just sit there and the lasers would fire. The second is after i used my W ( the void rift ) Velkoz would suddenly freeze mid movement and be stretched straight out into a strange looking triangle.\r\n Note: I was using the Arch light skin\r\n\r\n&lt;PS&gt; I have a image of the 2nd bug but i dont know how to add it to this post\r\n\r\nBasebrat1","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-11-11T22:35:04.556+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Basebrat,\n\nThanks for the report! \n\nIf you'd like to upload the images, you can first upload the image to a site like imgur.com and then just copy/paste the image link into your post or reply. :] \n\nIn the future, please report bugs occurring on the PBE on the [PBE Report a Bug](http://pbr.pbe.leagueoflegends.com/pbe/en_BE/bugReport/create) section so we can better track issues occurring on PBE versus live.
