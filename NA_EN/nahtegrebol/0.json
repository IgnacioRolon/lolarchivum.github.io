Everything that you NEED to be able to play, and succeed in this game is free. If you WANT a skin, or WANT to buy a champion that you don't have enough ip for, that is when the money comes in. Skins aren't needed, and Riot is not forcing you to buy them. So yea, this game is the furthest thing from being centered around money.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Thryale","date":"2015-01-14T01:26:48.575+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just curious, but if this was intentional, why not design the \"gun\" to be a gun shaped cross bow type of thing.
