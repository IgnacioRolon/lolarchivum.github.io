That said, if you keep responding to the Support Ticket (assuming that you've made one already) and keep a calm, level and professional head about it then chances are you'll get more answers to your question than you would by yelling, screaming and cussing out Riot, as people are more inclined to help those with a good attitude than those with a bad attitude.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LostFr0st","date":"2017-05-08T23:28:21.191+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"May I ask what exactly happened?\nIs the account you're posting from the one that was banned or did you \"acquire\" another account (that was likely botted to 30 by a scrub somewhere).\nThere are different reasons for bans, and your ban code (the year you are banned until) will tell you what that reason is when you google it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Colgate Gator","date":"2017-05-09T19:37:12.611+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Top kek.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Primaquarius","date":"2017-05-09T19:35:57.735+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Another salty ex-Leaguer who didnt read the ToS bit about NOT CHEATING and NO REFUNDS ON CONTENT","replies":[]},{"poster":"Periscope","date":"2017-05-09T03:25:08.294+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It doesn't appear like you want any help, just throwing insults at the only group that can assist you (riot).","replies":[]},{"poster":"e46 Fanatic","date":"2017-05-08T23:26:30.363+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm guessing you were banned for using 3rd party software or something, (Or so they think)?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Marshbouy","date":"2017-05-08T23:26:26.620+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you think you were unjustly banned you can send in a support ticket.","replies":[]}]}
