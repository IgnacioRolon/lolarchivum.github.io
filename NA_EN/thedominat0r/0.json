The way I fixed it **permanently ** was I changed the graphic processor.\nI.E - I right clicked on league on it had this option \"Run with graphics processor\".

I have a laptop with a  Nvidia 640M LE and an integrated Intel 4000 chip. I could force the game to run on the integrated chip but kept getting the DirectX error every time I tried launching with the Nvidia 640M LE. \n\nHere is one potential solution:\nDisable Displaylink Driver. There is a known conflict between Displaylink Drivers and DirectX. If you use a USB dock that uses Displaylink drivers OR if your computer manufacturer automatically installed Displaylink drivers on there, then you may experience this problem. \n\nHere is the link for the tool that will allow you to Enable and Disable Displaylink Drivers without having to uninstall them:\n\nhttp://www.displaylink.com/support/ticket.php?id=368 \n\nThis error affects many other games as well.
