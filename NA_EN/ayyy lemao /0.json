I&#039;ve come to you on behalf of my season 5 main, Ryze. I understand that Ryze is a big part of League of Legends story/Lore, but I&#039;ve also come to understand that he&#039;s going to be getting reworked every time. With the recent Ryze rework, he was incredibly powerful, being able to obliterate anyone within his path. Then, he started to receive nerfs. His Ultimate was eventually reduced, his spell flux did less damage (e), and his mana cost is outrageously high. I&#039;ve played ryze ever since season 5. He was able to stay in lane without suffering any mana loss up intil about level 5-6. But with this reworked Ryze, he can&#039;t stay in lane for more than 3 levels. He suffers extremely hard in the early game, and can&#039;t deal damage up until 15-20 minutes. I went against a Lyssandra and (Note, she suffers extreme mana loss as well) But she was able to harass me with her aoe spell. And If I returned the trade, she dealt more damage. I can&#039;t play Ryze anymore simply because my team can&#039;t be coordinated in Silver, not only that. Ryzes&#039; ult is literally a useless spell without your team. His old ult where he got an AOE damage buff, more AP, MORE COOLDOWNS; allowed me to fight as a team early game or mid game. As of where the new Ryze has to E, E just to be able to do damage as an AOE. His CD on his E is terrible, Almost a 2.4 second gap when utilizing a combo. He no longer has a CD reduction on his W. So you simply have to wait for it to come back. His stats are so weak. Ryze used to be top lane, but he&#039;s irrelevant in top and mid. He simply just gets destroyed. And if you&#039;re behind, there is no comeback. Don&#039;t get me wrong, Riot. I love this Ryze, but why do you think he has the lowest win rate? Why does nobody play him in casual. Only the Pros play him. I just wished you can at least improve his sustainability, his E, and his Ult. IMO, his ult isn&#039;t as great as this reworked made it to be. Ryze is literally a glasscannon. That&#039;s it. Please, please. Buff Ryze so I can play him again. It&#039;s not fun not being able to stay in lane, Spam E and lose all your mana then having to back. I got flamed so hard for playing Ryze against that Lissandra because she can hit me through minions. And stun me twice. I love this Ryze, but please do something about him. He&#039;s too weak to be &quot;Good&quot; in casual play. Ranked, anything. I had full Items on Ryze, but a morgana on my team did more damage with less items. There&#039;s a lot of champions that need more nerfs than Ryze does. No one touches him anymore. Only high ELO players do. But what about the majority? I&#039;m very sorry for my rant, but know that I enjoy what I enjoy. I enjoy Ryze, but i get tilted because I get fed, and can&#039;t help team because I get one shot, either way. Sorry, Riot.","replies":[]}
