Problem is, that there isn&#039;t really a nice picture of the Hextech, regarding the backside and the bottom of the chest. \nSo I would be really happy if any Rioter from the desing team or anybody else could help me fulfill my idea.\n\nBest regards,\nSirPenco.\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2016-08-03T19:30:39.613+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello!\n\nSo I asked around, and found a Rioter who is going to try to get you the information you need for the base and back of the Hextech crate, by next week.  Hopefully that's not too late for you in time for your gf's birthday.\n\nBut!  There's a cost.  We **demand* ** to see photographs of the finished product in exchange ;)  \n\nWere you thinking of making the Premium chest box, or the standard one?  Let me know, and I can tell the Rioter (they are a little too shy to come to the Boards) who's working on the art for it.\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-rainbows}} \n\n######Ok, we don't 'demand' but we'd both really really love to see photos.","replies":[{"poster":"Brotenko","date":"2016-08-04T14:10:43.111+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey mate!\n\nThank you for your high efforts to help me, I really appreciate that and will definetly post some picture of the finished crate! :D\nAnd don't worry about the time, there's still plenty of time to go until she has birthday, so don't pressure yourselves too much.\n\nOh, and before I forget it, I want to build the normal Hextech crate, because I already have the blue LED's.\n\nThank you very much again for the quick help!\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2016-08-06T03:00:24.523+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SirPenco,realm=EUW,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=bAyK0mVs,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2016-08-04T14:10:43.111+0000)\n>\n> Hey mate!\n> \n> Thank you for your high efforts to help me, I really appreciate that and will definetly post some picture of the finished crate! :D\n> And don&#x27;t worry about the time, there&#x27;s still plenty of time to go until she has birthday, so don&#x27;t pressure yourselves too much.\n> \n> Oh, and before I forget it, I want to build the normal Hextech crate, because I already have the blue LED&#x27;s.\n> \n> Thank you very much again for the quick help!\n> {{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}\n\nHello again!\n\nThat Rioter who said they were going to work on it, has delivered!\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/NC2ErNv.jpg\n\nDoes this give you enough information to be getting on with your own hextech 'crafting'?
