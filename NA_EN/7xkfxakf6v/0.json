Since the release of patch 4.17 been a real issue for us on the mac client. \n\nI play League with my 2 brothers all 3 of us going into que together with the mac client. Through the games we have tried all three of us crash on average 2-4 times each game before the 20 minute mark. From what we have seen the game will freeze briefly before it closes altogether followed by either a bugsplat error message or the mac \"would you like to report this problem?\" message. Intervals of which we crash vary and we do not always crash at the same time as one another. From trying different modes on League we have found that we do not crash in custom Summoners Rift vs bots, custom ARAM 1v1, and ARAM PvP. From that the issue seems to be tied specifically to PvP in Summoners Rift. \n\nHope that helps and that the issue is resolved quickly. :S","replies":[{"poster":"IIIIIlIIIIIIl","date":"2014-09-28T22:21:33.794+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"This was helpful thanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Calimdir","date":"2014-09-28T22:39:06.164+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would like it to be known that I have indeed crashed in ARAM PvP, so it is not tied to summoners rift.

I went through and did all of these things to no avail. I went through and attempted to create a custom game on each mode having bots and then also no bots(just me). Every time i did this, i wouldn't connect as usual. I don't get any champion panels, i just get a frozen black screen, which i can only exit by using Command Option Escape. I attempt to hit the orange reconnect button but i get the same results as before, a black screen. i can exit the black screen and attempt to reconnect once more before it doesn't show that i am in game when i restart league. I also would like to point out that the same things are happening with normal games. I have tried a normal game twice but i won't try anything else for the fear of losing LP(resulting in demotion) or getting reported and receiving a leaver mark which could get me banned. i have a lot of free time, so if you need me to test anything for you i have a lot of free time.
