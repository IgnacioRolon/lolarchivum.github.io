I know that there's a lot of discussions about this problem, but i did not find any solutions. My ping is normaly good, around 33-35 ms, but then, since one week and without having changed anything, i have some high peaks going to 1000 even 2000 ms each 5 to 10 minutes that gives me frequent \"attempting to connect\". So it's imposible for me to play. I use a wireless connection, but it always worked fine. I would like some new advices because i am about to quit League Of Legend because of this.\r\n\r\nThank you very much\r\n\r\nMath","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-07-07T21:05:34.156+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While wireless is convenient, it sounds like it may be causing an issue for you here. I recommend you try a wired connection, and if you still see these latency spikes, take a look at our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues), which has a lot of steps to resolve your issue. \n\nLet me know if this helped!","replies":[]}]}
