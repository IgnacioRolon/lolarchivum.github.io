It's weaker in every fight, no matter what. It literally can't be stronger unless there is a point where the carry can have a higher expected dps with the new system than they do on live.\n\nSo, that raises a question: Are you willing to let carries have more damage with the new system than they do on live after a certain number of autoattacks, or is it just going to be a straight nerf? That's not a numbers question, it's a design question. What do you want out of it?\n\nNo matter what your answer is though, I dislike the proposal. I think it's homogenizing, and works to hard to force all the champions in a class to play similarly. You're taking a very general stat, used by champions with multiple different playstyles, and you're forcing them into all playing the same way. Right now, the only thing crit encourages is autoattacking. You're changing it into forcing people to autoattack the same target over and over again. You're forcing a playstyle on people by attaching that playstyle to a non-negotiable stat. \n\nIf we're going to derandomize crit, the best way to do it is in a way that is as playstyle-neutral as possible. We should have crit give a %damage increase to autoattacks. That way, playstyle differences can be forced solely by champion kits, not by what kind of stat they're forced to buy. Doing otherwise is way, way too homogenizing. It puts too much important on a playstyle derived from a stat, instead of playstyles derived from their kits.\n\nTo put it simply, it's boring, it's dull, and it promotes champions to be similar to each other instead of distinct. That's not healthy for the game. We can achieve any balance goals we're after without having to resort to trying to force homogenization of playstyles on a class.","replies":[{"poster":"ShaolinToilet","date":"2016-11-08T06:37:00.537+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"I don't think you read his idea","replies":[{"poster":"Sightless66","date":"2016-11-08T06:55:47.482+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Definitely read it.

Is it intended to represent a potential increase in damage after fighting for long enough? Or is it meant solely to be a gate on early damage in a fight? Numbers are the factor that determines that.\n\nBesides, 3/5 of my post had nothing to do with numbers. I criticized the design of making crit attack speed based, and I maintain those criticism. \n\n>without really changing the play style of marksmen since they will still be basic attacking from range like always\n\nNo, as I made a point of, it's a significant change in playstyle, because it encourages autoattacking the same target once you've built up stacks on them. There are carries who very much don't want to do that. Mobile, bursty carries are encouraged to switch targets based on openings in the fight, but this discourages and punishes that. Assassin type carries are supposed to threaten the backlines, which harder if your first attacks are strictly weaker. It also encourages attack speed based builds, because AD focused crit builds will suck dick from not being able to stack fast enough to make crit worthwhile.\n\nIf you want something that doesn't change playstyles, then it's very, very simple: %damage increase to autoattacks. Mathematically the same expected dps, and doesn't favor anybody. It's better than OP's proposal.\n\n>and no this doesn't make armorpen builds the new standard crit would still result in higher dps \n\nIf the first 3 autoattacks of a fight are strictly weaker than they are on live, then it absolutely will put pressure on carries to use armor penetration builds. It doesn't matter if it eventually builds up to slightly superior dps if it is strictly weaker every time you attack a new target. Ability focused builds are already only slightly off of being the norm for a lot of AD carries. This could easily push them over the edge.\n\n>It might even lead to more viable build options as well since you could just sit on that one infinity edge and still use it to amp up your dps big time whilst leaving room to buy different attack speed and ad items you would otherwise not really build\n\nThis is just so wrong. I have so many criticisms of this one sentence. It makes so many bad assumptions.\n\nThere is not a single reason to believe that a playstyle restriction would open up item options. There has never been a point in league's history where restrictions on playstyles opened up options. The game's design disallows that.\n\nLet's enumerate why. First, sitting on one crit item will be worse than before, not better. If you're required to build stacks on enemies in order to make crit effective, then the last thing you want to do is go for low attack speed builds, but high attack speed requires that you buy crit. I'm not going to buy an attack speed reliant dps steroid without actually buying attack speed, and that requires buying more crit.\n\nSecond, what \"different attack speed and ad items\" are you thinking of? For attack speed, are you thinking of zeal items? Because, if you are, you can already stack those. The only other ones are BotRK and Wit's End, and these changes aren't making them any less crappy/situational. As for AD items, you'd still pick those up third or fourth, just like you do now. The only difference is that you won't possibly get them second in any situation because you NEED attack speed to make your early crit effective. All this does is limit a potential option.\n\nI seriously don't think you thought about the items at all when you said that.\n\nThird, there is nothing new about crit being a dps amp. Crit already is a DPS amp. That is explicitly its purpose. 20% crit is a 20% boost to dps. And yet, you don't see people sitting on one crit item on live, because it's mathematically inefficient. If you're looking to maximize dps, then there is a mathematical forumla for how much crit is needed. Having a ramp up doesn't change that. It doesn't make it any more rewarding to sit on one crit item. Maximizing dps will still require multiple items, particularly since all the attack speed items that are viable for a carry to purchase have crit.\n\nWhy do you think this would open up build options? Do you have a reason? Are you just thinking that because it's a change, it would open up more options? What's your justification?","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"ProfDrDeath","date":"2016-11-07T22:45:25.868+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's only if the underlying numbers stay the same.\n\nWith his system, it is no longer relevant to cap Crit at 100% Chance.

Granted, the current crit system also ends up leading to pretty constant DPS, but this wouldn't be an improvement in that respect.\n\nI personally think a better alternative would be turning crit into a three passive, e.g. deal bonus damage every three autos. It's simple, visible to all, and allows for DPS-based burst, while also being easier to design for.

I would still keep the pseudo-RNG element since the unreliability is important in keeping it a late game stat. Obviously, the effect can be powerful if it isn't on every hit early-mid game and having that powerful effect on basically every hit late game is fine if it's balanced around it. This should do 3 things:\n\n1. By making Critical Strike affect only Bonus Armor, it means that Critical Hits in the early game before anyone buys armor do barely any extra damage. This eliminates the \"unfair\" feeling you get when a huge burst of damage hits you in lane and makes those 1% Crit Chance runes worthless early game.\n-\n2. By making Critical Strike do % shred, it makes Critical Strike a powerful tank busting stat since it negates damage reduction from armor stacking rather than doing a huge burst of flat physical damage that vaporizes squishy champs.\n-\n3. By keeping the pseudo-RNG element, it keeps Critical Strike as a late game stat since the damage boost is powerful but reliable until you stack multiple sources of Crit Chance. This helps keep armor a strong option until later in the game and lets Fighters and Tanks have stronger defense in the mid game while still letting Marksmen carry late.\n\n*If needed, you could even make Critical Hits into a stacking shred which each Crit reduces Bonus Armor by X% for Y Seconds* (only for the one scoring Crits, not the whole team). This could be a good way to balance with the Last Whisper items which don't need to be stacked but can be rebalanced to not reduce Bonus Armor as much depending on if it stacks with Critical Strike or becomes mutually exclusive.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HazyCloud7","date":"2016-11-07T21:41:58.318+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This would be such a gigantic nerf to adcs.\n\nI'm 100% in favor of reducing their burst in favor of DPS, but numbers wise this would be a gigantic nerf to both burst and DPS.

Looks good to me\n\nJhin breaks a lot of the rules for ADCs, the most prominent rule being that an ADC is a sustained damage threat, whereas everything in Jhin's kit screams big-ass assassin who also happens to have range instead of mobility.\n\nIn any case, I don't think this really ruins Jhin at all. Ramp-up damage with his hilariously high AD sounds pretty damn good, even if it may not be as great as it is now, it's really damn good. Not to mention Jhin will never be able to make something like black cleaver work, not with his current kit.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Pierce The Veal","date":"2016-11-07T18:08:34.863+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"I'd just be happy if we had less AS/Crit items.
