In this particular case there's 1 main reason why I valued this interaction over consistency. The biggest difference between the spells you've named and Swain's ultimate is duration of effects. This to me was the crux of my decision making at the time. I wanted to carve out power budget in Swain's kit to maximize the duration of his ultimate in order to better reflect the experience of his old ult. I saw this mechanic as a minor design optimization that gave me valuable room in pursuing that goal. \n\nFrom an adjacent angle, the burden of play for the spells you've mentioned are also much higher since they resolve much faster, have shorter range, are un-castable when there are no valid enemies nearby and include mechanics like keeping in range for X time / marking enemies before hand. All of these aspects make them much more contextual than Swain's ultimate and it would feel like unnecessary counter play for them to also adhere to vision rules strictly. \n\nI think you can make a reasonable argument that the amount of power budget I'm actually buying for Swain's ult duration isn't worth the consistency/expectation cost, but at the time this was the rationale I had for it being a reasonable trade off. \n\nMy personal taste is to preserve the power of vision control when possible. Another place on Swain I'd highlight is that his E doesn't reveal targets it roots (we are pretty inconsistent on this stuff as well) but his W is a semi-global reveal which offsets that. I felt dis-empowering the base-line functionality of E here actually created more synergy in his kit internally and made accessing his power feel more intentional.","replies":[{"poster":"Teridax68","date":"2018-07-14T04:22:22.090+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Wav3Break,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=roxpMzNU,comment-id=000a00020004,timestamp=2018-07-14T03:04:45.450+0000)\n> \n> I think you can make a reasonable argument that the amount of power budget I&#x27;m actually buying for Swain&#x27;s ult duration isn&#x27;t worth the consistency/expectation cost, but at the time this was the rationale I had for it being a reasonable trade off. \n\nI mean, at the end of the day it comes down to how much one values micro-optimizations over consistency, though at the same time I'm personally averse to making exceptions to a general rule for reasons that are not themselves exceptional. In this particular case, power budget is a vast, general thing that could be approached from a bunch of different ways, many of which would not incur a long-term cost such as a degradation to the game's consistency. While it was an honorable decision to try to preserve the old ult's duration, at this point I feel the focus has nonetheless shifted from the drain to the explosion at the end, so players have an incentive to shorten the duration as much as possible in most cases. In this respect, I feel removing this exception may not affect Swain or his power budget as drastically as had been anticipated.\n\nOn the subject of vision and stealth detection, though, I also very much agree that vision should be kept sparse, yet clearly impactful. In this respect, it may perhaps be better to flip the situation, and remove stealth detection from a whole bunch of abilities, instead of adding it on Swain. In general, vision still feels like largely unexplored territory on champion kits, and is also a hotbed of inconsistent behavior: some abilities reveal the area where they land, other don't, some will reveal enemies they hit, others just have an impact sound, and some give strictly no response to whether or not they hit out of vision. Almost every time, there is no explanation on the ability tooltips for this kind of behavior.\n\nI very much like Swain's W as an ability whose clear, central purpose is to provide vision as a tactical advantage, and I feel this could help define vision across more abilities: if the ability is specifically intended to supply information as utility, then it should likely provide vision or some equivalent, but otherwise it likely shouldn't. With this in mind, I'd personally be okay with Swain's ult not working against invisible enemies, so long as more effects were then retroactively changed to lose their own implicit stealth detection. Once more, we'd be back to a more consistent environment, and ideally one where vision and detection could have a chance to stand out better.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SlowChemical","date":"2018-07-12T19:32:28.376+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Really good question, would love to hear a follow up red response.","replies":[]},{"poster":"5050BS","date":"2018-07-12T09:13:07.383+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"His Old Ult would Drain Stealthed champs.

In this particular case, if it's healthier for Swain's ult to not target invisible opponents, why doesn't this reasoning apply to other auto-targeted abilities? There are effectively two types of inconsistency at work: inconsistency in presentation, in that two very similar abilities can differ in ways the players cannot reasonably expect, but also inconsistency in reasoning, in which those two abilities work differently purely because they stem from two different trains of thought, neither of which were done with consideration for the other.

Whether you like it or not, these abilities have stealth detection, no matter how implicit. For sure, it's _possible_ to do abilities differently, and it could be perfectly valid, but in order to be so there needs to be consistent justification, which should also be clear to players. Here, there does not appear to be any such justification, which is also why many players are pointing out the resulting inconsistency.","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2018-07-12T19:41:52.129+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Teridax68,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=roxpMzNU,comment-id=000a00020002000000000000,timestamp=2018-07-12T19:13:54.218+0000)Okay, but then we also have a lot of effects that _aren&#x27;t_ static kill zones: I mentioned this in another post, but we also have stuff like Hecarim&#x27;s W and Camille&#x27;s W which impact upon stealthed opponents, and even Morgana&#x27;s own ult has the same functionality. \n\nSee, to me that isn't a disconnect still -- Morgana's ult specifically grants vision as part of its effect and Hecarim's W is a ticking damage zone, while Camille's is a non-targeted AoE.

I don't believe in the separation of abilities you've described, a separation that you've admitted to being wholly subjective, so if your entire argument relies on this unfounded assumption, we're just going to have to agree to disagree, and leave it at that.","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2018-07-12T22:26:24.297+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Okay, but then by your own admission, you took a discussion, tried to turn it into a different discussion, and then proposed a &quot;solution&quot; to the latter discussion as framed in your own terms.\n\nIf the point of a discussion is to only discuss a single viewpoint of the situation, then yes, I did, and I apologize if that was your intent.

Your apology as formulated in your third sentence does this properly, but the one in your second sentence does not.

We started off sharing our different viewpoints on the topic of inconsistency, a topic many others have been able to discuss, and share their own viewpoints, without derailing the conversation. \"This is the topic of discussion, and we have different viewpoints\" is different from \"I have a different viewpoint, so I'm making my own discussion happen, even if it wasn't the discussion at hand\". That you do not see inconsistencies with the way different abilities are implemented is fine, but to to go on to try to argue based on this opinion means I have no means of continuing further discussion with you on the matter, other than by repeating that I disagree with the premise, and was trying to talk about something a little different long before you gave your first input. What exactly were you expecting me to say?\n\n> [{quoted}](name=The Djinn,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=roxpMzNU,comment-id=000a000200020000000000000000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2018-07-12T22:26:24.297+0000)\n> \n> If you do not agree with that interpretation that&#x27;s fine, and I&#x27;m sorry if you see it as me disrailing your discussion.\n\n\"I'm sorry you feel that way\" merely displaces blame on the other person by putting the focus on their reaction, rather than on whatever it is you did that may have caused the situation in the first place. It is not a genuine apology, and is disrespectful to the person you are producing this fake apology to. As a moderator in charge of monitoring player behavior and leading by example, you should know better, and it is disappointing to see this kind of attitude in what has otherwise been a civil discussion.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Z3Sleeper","date":"2018-07-12T11:17:57.219+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Reconsider.
