Why would I want a big scuttle on my team?\n\nTanks are supposed to have CC and low damage against champions. Big difference to make there... \n... Anyway a tank like the OP suggests would need to be a blocker, like braum. \n\nWould be interesting if say... Resistances and mana were all converted into HP at a 10HP to 1 for resistances, and 1:1 on the mana. You could then just give him a passive 50%+1% per 1000 total HP damage  reduction. \nThen his abilities could be about raising walls to defend his team (Maybe raise a stationary braum E that redirects damage to himself?), building terrain (Im thinking level 1 windwall size rocks),  a self-shield that gives MS and damage reduction, and maybe an ultimate that lets him encase himself in stone for rapid healing, with a passive component that increases his total HP by a %+1% per 1000 total HP?\n\nEdit; \nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/PlfI3Qyl-shalaeon-the-spirit-of-iron \nAlso shameless plug for one of my favorite fan concepts!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"LeftyRaydy","date":"2018-09-27T22:04:01.608+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Pyrithegethon,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=HKuVjLqI,comment-id=,timestamp=2018-09-27T17:56:07.969+0000)\n>\n> Imagine a champion as tanky as a 600 armor Malphite vs a 2 item ADC with the CC of Garen or Mundo(just 1 form of non hard CC) and the damage of full tank Alistar. \n> \n> Sounds like a useless champion, right?

The idea is not great, because while it would be fun maybe a few times to be unkillable what do yo do when your teams behind or even ahead. teams would just ignore you and go straight for the back line if you have low CC and damage. meaning that you could be wailing away on an enemy ADC but he would just attack another target. Its not very interactive and I mean when you have someone like Garen, who is almost un-killable when he is ahead, has only silence as CC, and deals tons of damage what would be the benefit of playing this \"champion\".","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ranmaru","date":"2018-09-28T01:54:12.281+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{item:3031}} {{champion:67}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:23}} {{champion:103}} {{champion:28}} {{champion:114}} {{champion:164}} {{champion:32}} {{champion:427}}{{champion:145}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:24}} {{champion:40}} {{champion:96}} {{champion:110}} {{champion:142}} {{item:3070}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tahminatrix ","date":"2018-09-27T22:45:09.328+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You are basically defining a full tank tahm kench with no passive (and no W by extension)","replies":[]},{"poster":"xDelightify","date":"2018-09-27T21:15:50.084+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"am i allowed to introduce u to rammus? {{champion:33}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hethalean","date":"2018-09-27T18:00:50.116+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How would it lane and not get demolished?","replies":[{"poster":"Doge2020","date":"2018-09-27T18:06:35.706+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Hethalean,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=HKuVjLqI,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-09-27T18:00:50.116+0000)\n>\n> How would it lane and not get demolished?\n\nIt would have itâ€™s extremely high damage reduction to not get destroyed by damage lol","replies":[]}]}]}
