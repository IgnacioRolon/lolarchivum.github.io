A good support in high level play will leave his adc alone in lane as often as is possible to do safely so that the adc can acquire solo experience.\n\nThe reality is that playing support at a high level requires one to understand when to babysit the adc and when to be doing actual support things to control the map.","replies":[{"poster":"DemonDrake","date":"2017-03-15T13:10:02.305+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dear summoner,\n\nPerfect!!!

Not supporting. Do not make the mistake of thinking you can ride on Support sympathy when you have 0 intention of actually playing the role.\n\nThe issue is how broad the term support really is. You can support other lanes and not strictly bot. Along with it he is playing Nunu and abusing Nunus rather strong counter jungle power. If you look into his OP.GG on his Nunu games you will find a majority of them are victories and with it he actually outlevels the enemy jungler/support while his ADC outlevels the enemy adc. This is a massive way to win games just by raw power as he is giving his team the highest possible expereince lead. \n\nHe isn't playing support in the traditional league sense however in more of a Dota esque style where he roams and helps everyone while hindering an enemy player. Should his bot laner not be able to play safe and simply disregard they are in a bad situation it can lead to issues.\n\nAlong with this he is forcing the enemy support into an uncomfortable position where they must either roam and make sure they help other lanes like a second jungler or they have to stay bot and know that both them and their ally laner will fall behind in EXP. \n\nIn my opinion it is a brilliant strategy.","replies":[{"poster":"TyrekGoldenspear","date":"2017-02-28T23:26:22.828+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"Except you're not supporting other lanes. That's like saying the Jungler is supporting the other lanes.\n\nSupport isn't that broad when you define it as assisting a specific teammate through their time of weakness hit their powerspike unhurt.\n\nBy duo jungling he isn't supporting the other lanes, if anything he's just supporting his primary jungler because he's making their job easier.\n\nI don't hate on the strategy, but what I am against is the definition of the role being muddled up. This stratagem is simply duo jungle. Not support counterjungling all game. Now that it is called that, the whole \"Nunu off-meta banned Rito Sux\" angle of the argument goes out the window.

There is no feasible way to select yourself as a secondary jungler whose goal is to counterjungle and gank lanes. There is no option for this thus changing the set idea of the support role to a roaming supportive jungler is the only way to even get by with it. Should this of been in the old pick system (You know that mess where pick order was the way to go) it would have been possible but due to Riots change of this system he again cannot play the game in his own method (which clearly works by his 56% winrate).\n\nThe biggest issue here is how Riot has handled the meta and it simply can't be changed at the moment as the game has grown around it. While strategies like this do work and can be quite effecient they simply are banworthy as you don't play X role the way X role was formed to be.","replies":[{"poster":"TyrekGoldenspear","date":"2017-03-01T00:46:28.983+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Except he can just duo with an ADC that doesn't mind to 1v2.

Keep in mind that a support can roam, but there is such a thing as roaming too much.\n\nAlso another side of the issue you failed to mention is that the _commnuity_ started this by their crusade against trollpicks and their reporting of this Nunu enough times for the IFS to get him banned in the first place.

Yet you miss a hook a grab a heal a shield or just misposition a bit get insta blown up? \n\nHow about Zyra, Brand, Malphite, MF, Sion, Annie almost all have seen proplay sup, rocking various spells.None of them are sup champs so ban SKT, TSM and so on ?\n\nWhat you are suggesting has nothing to do with suporting. \nLets report every roam, everytime jungl doesnt gank, everytime anyone actually does anything creative that is not highlighted in pro games ???\nMight as well bann the pros for playing ouside roles picks spells?\n\nHow about this all lanes jung don't gank report him for same reason - jung is supose to gank why not report.\nTop is not tanky - report. Wtf top comming mid to roam - report. Stay top till 25 min in game. And you have the right for 1 or 2 tps.\nMid is roaming - report. Don't like mid pick - report.
