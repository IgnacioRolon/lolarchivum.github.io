The die in 1 auto.\n\nIt may not have been necessary back when, since Runnan's wasn't always a goto item on ADCs. \n\nTo be honest, I think Runnan's has gotten kinda ridiculous. Before they changed it, it was niche on a few champions. (Kalista built it, and I believe their was an AD kennen build that used it.) And then they tried to normalize it as an ADC item. (They may have been sore when Kayle abused it) \n\nSo yeah, it did benefit many ADC's by normalizing it's stats. While screwing over High AS reliant champs, who don't scale as well with crit. (nice knowing you kalista) And the end result, is ADC having access to ridiculous amounts of wave clear, with out really paying anything for it since it's the best Zeal item in the game. (has better AS and MS than Shiv (the original clear item for ADCs) or RFC, both of which are in the same price range.) The only thing that comes close to that is PD. But the Clear speed is almost entirely better utility than the dueling power form PD. \n\nLastly, that inappropriate levels of wave clear encroach on ADC who's kit exclusively occupied that niche. (Wave clear ADCs like Sivir, MF, Jinx with her rockets.)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Marshbouy","date":"2016-10-28T03:11:29.575+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm going to go out on a limb here and guess that getting zerg swarmed in league as a single target champion is not on your list of fun gameplay experiences?","replies":[{"poster":"PureSilvrr","date":"2016-10-28T03:30:04.661+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:90}} MWAHHAHAHHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"The Ecdysiast","date":"2017-08-01T14:59:45.415+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You need to address a bug with this intention. I tested it myself and Poppy's Q deals exactly half damage at all levels to mistwalkers, when they should die at early levels. \n\nRightfully, they wouldn't die _late_ game to one Poppy Q because part of it is %hp and ghouls can have more HP than the rest of the damage Poppy Q would normally do. Early game, they don't have that much HP. \n\nBut the code is such that they somehow have 50% damage reduction against it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"OyddAWqJ5r","date":"2016-10-29T10:53:45.230+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly it's moreso just the rate at which you accumulate ghouls lategame. Every 4th is great compared to the level 1 every 12th but with the added factor of not being able to Last Rites minions when grouped ends up making ghoul spawning a very slow process.\n\nThe thing I like the most about Yorick is those high moments when he feels like the Shepherd of Souls. But lategame you kinda just become \"The Beefy Shovel Guy\".\n\nI personally feel increasing the spawn rate midgame and lategame would fix the issue.
