He saw things that made him hate cowardice and contributed to killing his captain. \r\n\r\nWhat if Swain and Leblanc are behind all this in order to make Darius an efficient pawn?\r\n\r\nSion declares he is no pawn of Swain and that he isnt his general because he seems to know something we dont, or his intuition is saying Swain is merely manipulating others to further Swains plans.\r\n\r\nWhat if Swain or Leblanc saw potential in Darius, but had to get rid of things making him weak and not in his full potential; his parents.\r\n\r\nThey may have tried to get rid of Draven but saw how Darius became stronger for having something to protect, unknown to him he is a puppet.\r\n\r\nHe sees Noxus as weak with nobles and hates cowardice which is what Swain and Leblanc wanted; to get rid of enemies that can thwart Swains plans. \r\n\r\nWhen Darius met Swain he was ok with him and saw a strong Noxus in him but didnt know Swain and Leblanc basically fed him into their ideals.\r\n\r\nDarius isnt a unique individual, his quotes even show that as they are almost all about the same exact things: cowardice, strength, and crushing enemies. Darius is merely Swains pawn, something Sion refuses to be.","replies":[{"poster":"Kindlejack","date":"2015-12-31T22:28:55.577+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"What if Alfred had Bruce's parents killed because he wanted him to become The Batman?","replies":[{"poster":"GreenLore","date":"2016-01-01T01:26:02.854+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"We all know Batmans greatest enemy.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJABz1XpOI4","replies":[]},{"poster":"KnightsKemplar","date":"2015-12-31T22:33:14.815+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol.
