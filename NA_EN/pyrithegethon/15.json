Illaoi causes a huge amount of player frustration at the best of times but if they nerf the aspects of her kit that give enemy players a bad experience against her, they'll give themselves a lot more breathing room to make her strong.\n\nRight now I think it would be a mistake to buff her significantly because there's basically no way she wouldn't be perma-ban if she was stong. This is why Riot have hardly buffed her at all since she came out even though she's essentially considered a troll pick by the community. If they tone down the stuff that makes players hate her, they can actually make her good.\n\nObviously if these changes go through then they will just be flat nerfs but they sepcifically said they wanted to buff her late game so it's clear that they're gonna nerf her in these areas and buff her in others.

Illaoi has the issue where she brings nothing to the team. Currently all she's good for it beating players who don't understand her kit and play against her all wrong. She needs a big increase on her slow, like turn it into a stun or a 99% slow that lasts a long time if they leave the zone. Or give her some speed. Anything to help her stick to a target or engage, or offer utility. \n\nShe needs something to give her a reason to be picked other than just damage. Illaoi is a tanky/high damage CCless champion Like Shyvana, but without the speed to stick to people, so everyone just calmly walks away while she does nothing. The other juggernauts (like Garen) have speed, or a hard CC/engaging tool (Darius) and I feel like Illaoi needs more than that very brief slow that usually activates when the enemy is miles away from her. She needs... some utility/niche/purpose.  \n\nTL;DR: She's frustrating to play against but not a \"strong\" champion. Fix the frustration without nerfing her. Give her some sort of defining trait/a reason to pick her.\n\nThe buffs like faster tentacle spawns are wonderful but there's so much more that needs to be done. Like her vision issue ruins her. People can see tentacles perk up when she goes near them, even in fog of war, and that gives away her position.

But the debuff lasts so long and has so little immediate impact that it frequently just results in the enemy laner playing passively until it wears off. It doesn't even have a huge impact if they DO decide to go in - it just puts a bit more pressure on them.\n\nAnything that streamlines it a bit and increases the impact would be immensely helpful. The \"kill tentacles to remove debuff\" mechanic is a bad idea to me - it encourages the player to sit back and wait for tentacles to spawn, so it creates the noob trap of making passive/nonfarming play feel like the correct answer.\n\nWhy not try this:\n-Vessel duration is significantly shorter, duration is reset if Illaoi lands another E (because the fact that it currently doesn't makes no sense, if I can chain Tests of Spirit successfully I should be rewarded).\n-Vessel CANNOT DAMAGE TENTACLES and tentacles swing faster if the Vessel is the target, like a specific-case version of her Ult self-buff (or alternatively tentacles swing more frequently).\n-Vessel can see tentacle attack range, perhaps as an extension of the vessel visual overlay.\n\nThis way, Illaoi significantly increases pressure on a Vessel, but they don't feel like \"wait it out\" is the right response - they instead want to stay in the fight and farm while having increased awareness of danger. Landing a Test of Spirit doesn't give you a feast-or-famine \"free farm for 20 seconds/do nothing whatsoever if you're behind\" result anymore, but it gives you a cumulative advantage window each time you do it, and that gives you a bunch of rewards if you can do it consistently in lane.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Flemman","date":"2016-03-22T19:05:52.474+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"one small question cross my mind, if illaoi E don't give assist, is it the reson she didn't take aggro from tower if she hit it too.\nWouldn't it be better, either for illaoi and her opponent, to give her the zilean's bomb 1 damage mechanic?","replies":[]},{"poster":"MrWasjig","date":"2016-03-21T16:02:29.527+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please just tone down the E/Vessel nonsense. \nIt is not fun to play against in the slightest and is just arduous to deal with at any and all points of the game.\n\nConclusion, not fun.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2016-03-21T15:45:15.507+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">removal of the 'hit Illaoi to reduce the spirit's life mechanic since that's not well communicated and is often just a trap).\n\nI <3 you.\n\nIntuitivity ftw","replies":[]}]}]}
