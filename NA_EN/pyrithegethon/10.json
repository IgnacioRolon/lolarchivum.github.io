Which then goes on a fairly long CD. Until those cds are up, she's statistically less mobile than almost all other champs in regards to dashing. \n\nGraves is not set by those limitations.  \n\nGraves also lowers his dash cd by 2 seconds per non crit, and 3 seconds with crits.\n\nAt 40% cdr, which Graves can readily get.  Graves resets his dash in 2/3 attacks. And since the dash resets his attack timer, it's actually faster than one would think. \n\nThe only time Kindred has \"more mobility\" is when she's hopping back and forth in a very particular zone for a very brief amount of time, and isn't really actually doing anything besides spitting out 150 damage and reset an auto.  And even then, Graves can achieve the same mobility she can in that particular instance. \n\nSo with that concluded, the only time Kindred has \"more mobility\" is walking back from base. But even then, remember, she has way lower base ms. So, all those dashes do is \"replace\" the speed Graves already has passively walking.  But even then, with that said, Graves can dash and just displace that anyways. \n\nPlease note, this also isn't even taking into effect for the special snowflake Graves that take Storm Raiders.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Br4ndon","date":"2016-05-12T22:08:13.183+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"This thread isnt about graves.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Karma Deified","date":"2016-05-12T19:11:17.657+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kindred is overbearing?
