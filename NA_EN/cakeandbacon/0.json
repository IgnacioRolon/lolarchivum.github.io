I get it, she's bad for the game with her current kit. If she isn't absolutely terrible she is way, way too good. The AOE resets off of one targeted, near instant combo make her unhealthy.\r\n\r\nBut this? How am I supposed to build her? AD bruiser with Triforce? Her AP burst got cut to ribbons here, and if I want to make use of that autoattack and AD scaling I have to build double pen.\r\n\r\nMaybe I'm missing something that Riot sees in it, but to me it looks like they've just produced a really unfocused kit, and I would really like to know what they're thinking with all this.","replies":[{"poster":"Mirage Night","date":"2015-01-22T08:10:05.680+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Unless they change the damage type of her abilities, she is going to a worse Eve","replies":[]},{"poster":"Malix Farwin","date":"2015-01-22T13:12:08.345+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You are suppose to roll an AD champ, ADC mid if possible.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Serenity Now","date":"2015-01-22T13:08:09.789+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gunblade, Rageblade, Occult, and Mejais :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Keevalroy","date":"2015-01-22T08:05:41.161+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wait for Scarra to figure it out and watch what he does.","replies":[]},{"poster":"WzqdQsZwQA","date":"2015-01-22T07:17:22.055+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"CakeandBacon","date":"2015-01-22T07:25:16.946+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looks like that's gonna be the thing to do after this.
