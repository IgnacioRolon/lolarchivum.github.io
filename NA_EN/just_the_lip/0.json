(still shooting for diamond)\r\n\r\nThere is so much tactical knowledge that new players don't understand, from positioning, to wave control, to objective focus (macro) ect. ect.\r\n\r\n**I really think smurfing should be disabled,** but lets face it, **YOU CANT GET RID OF IT.**\r\n\r\nVet player new account creations range from players being banned/suspended for a range of things but still want to play WITHIN 5 MINUTES OF A BAN  {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-popcorn}} \r\n\r\nTo People thinking they are \"ELO locked\" or stuck in an MMR because their LP gains are so low and their LP losses are SO HIGH.\r\n\r\nThis generates a populous of VETERAN players, playing with BRAND NEW players.\r\n\r\nEven with a system in place to ask \"new players\" if they are new or not, guess what, **LIE : IM NEW PLAYER** and boom, still facing the same smurf problem.\r\n\r\nMy thought would be to just allow players who already have accounts to be able to **ACCESS A NEW ACCOUNT @ LVL 30,** \r\n\r\nAnd have a similar option for players who ARE LEGITIMATELY NEW, to gain a brand new lvl 1 account. \r\n(problem here again LIE : IM NEW PLAYER, because unfortunately some people just want to pick on new/unskilled people)\r\n\r\nI think that would stop a lot of veteran LoL players with new accounts from rofl stomping legit new players because they got what they wanted : \r\nA new account lvl 30+ to play ranked on because their current ELO/MMR is so screwed they think they cant climb anymore on that account.\r\n\r\nAnd for the players who just get suspensions and bans and just want to flame and cause chaos for a free game, well, kinda hard to fix that because the players really need to fix themselves first.\r\n\r\n**BUT WHAT COULD ASSIST IN THIS?** **Adding an option to DISABLE YOUR IN GAME CHAT**, for players who know they have problems, but have a hard time not typing in games, but otherwise dont troll, and try to win.\r\n\r\nThis would reduce suspensions greatly and overall reduce smurfing in lower ELO/new player games in my opinion, why do i think this?\r\n\r\n**Because i am a Gold 1 player who peaked at plat 2 last season, smurfing in a new player game due to a suspension for toxic chat.**\r\n\r\n**Smurfing needs to stop to get more players interested in this game,** \r\n\r\ni have a friend who told me he wanted to start playing, and i honestly felt bad, because i don't think he will have fun, being rofl stomped by smurfs every game until he can figure things out on his own or i babysit him through his early levels of play and teach him how to improve quickly.\r\n\r\nThis game is rough, and i appreciate that, but the game is so much harder for new players to get into because of the disproportionate skill gap created by placing new players with hardened LoL veterans.\r\n\r\nIf you read this, thanks for your time, this was just a little rant i needed to get off my chest, \r\n\r\nbecause i feel bad for being the very thing i dislike : **A smurf just decimating new players or lower rank players.**\r\n\r\nGood luck to you all out there. and don't press the enter key if u have anger issues. \r\n\r\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}
