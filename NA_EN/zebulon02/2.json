When I start a game, the screen freezes then my computer too and there's nothing I can do except to restart my computer ! Honestly I have no idea what's going on. I'm going to send you a log, can you explain me how to do it ?\n\nty","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-18T17:12:33.592+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The freezing issue is likely caused by the Windows 10 Aniversary update that enabled Game DVR inside the Xbox Game Bar app. I suggest [disabling the game bar](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html) as a quick check to see if this is true.\n\nAs for your continuing crackling problem, I recommend updating your system drivers, specifically your audio drivers off of [MSI's service page.](https://us.msi.com/service/download/)\n\nLet me know if either of those steps helped.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"zebulon02","date":"2016-09-15T19:10:09.688+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Targons Blade,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=nGasaKN0,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-09-12T22:14:21.633+0000)\n>\n> Does the noise happen during specific events, abilities, or during certain audio playing beforehand?
