However, over the past few months (namely the ardent censor meta up until now) Support has grown into something much much more than that and it absolutely matters, even some Challenger players / Pro&#039;s currently believe that Support is one of the most impactful / meaningful roles in the game along with JG and I agree after playing it and talking to a few other Support mains who have expressed similar thoughts as myself. \r\n\r\nThe idea of &quot;Support&quot; in theory before the ardent meta (and some of the newer support items) is basically some lame person who is the adc&#039;s bitch, flat out there are still ppl who think that even though there are players like Olleh who show in the LCS the value of Roaming and basically being like a Jungle 2.0, someone who puts out pressure throughout the Map. \r\n\r\nLane phase lets just assume you never roamed at all, which you can do but i wouldn&#039;t say it&#039;s the best strategy but it all depends on your champ, like soraka isn&#039;t really the best roaming support BUT after lane phase, how many team fights are won or lost directly because of OUR (Support) actions? I mean literally every fight we win as a team, I feel like I was the one who tipped the fight into our favor, even if we were behind (or WAY behind but within reason). \r\n\r\nI play champs that have massive utility and CC built into their kits, now not all ppl may enjoy the champs that I do but that&#039;s also the great part of playing this role, we have a wide variable (not as much as top lane or even jg) of what is playable, not to be confused for being &quot;optimal&quot; or &quot;meta&quot; but even things off-meta can potentially be game changers (Look at Rox v SKT where Support MF made it&#039;s big debut). \r\n\r\nSO, if you read all that thanks, what I&#039;m getting at is this idea of &quot;Support&quot; is just out dated, the stigma is all wrong and ppl (not all but many) still have this idea that Support is either Low-Impact , Brain dead or played by ppl who aren&#039;t good when in reality Support is the polar opposite of that. \r\n\r\nI would like Riot to change the name of &quot;Support&quot; to something more fitting to the role, personally I feel like I am the X-Factor in the game, I feel like THE Playmaker, I setup all meaningful plays and work 5 steps ahead of everyone else to set them up. So a more fitting name / role title would be more appealing to newer players who are just picking up the role,  as well as shutting down this horrible outdated stigma that has changed pretty dramatically over the past year or so. \r\n\r\nThanks and have a good day","replies":[{"poster":"TheUrbanKitsune","date":"2018-02-13T03:06:19.960+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Support is pretty fitting though?\nYour job is to _support_ the team.\n\nDoesn't mean you aren't the playmaker.

That's the stigma behind Support and ADC to be honest, Support is Robin and ADC is batman EXCEPT, We as support dictate the lane, We dictate if that ADC gets fed or not (jg too), and even after the lane phase we as Support dictate how the fights can turn, the Variable / X-Factor in all fights isn't the ADC, it's the Support. \n\nWe all know that Kog'maw can do a crap ton of dmg if he gets his 3 core items and W is up, the Support is the one who either Accelerates that Dmg (if the Kog is on the his / her team) OR the Support is the one who turns the fight against that Threat (if that Kog is on enemy Team). \n\nSo I'd ask who is really Batman? \n\nI use that example to break this down in simple simple psychological thinking. People look at Support like Robin when Really it isn't, we are more Batman than any ADC for about 80% of the game, so why would I have a title that makes me less than when really I am so much more important to our team?\n\nSupport is a term that makes it sound Secondary, when someone is just picking up this game, explain all the roles let them know the premise of each and then ask them what role they want. It's extremely rare ppl are like \"SUPPORT! YEA\" not impossible at all, but rare, most want Mid tbh, Mid is the lane that ppl love to want to play, support is generally speaking one of the least just look at the overall numbers, Support is the least played role. \n\nI'm saying that the title of \"SUpport\" is a big part in why People DON'T want to play support. You sound less important just by name. \n\nIf I called this role \"X-Factor\" or something else that sounds a little more inviting I guarantee more ppl would want to play it and learn it especially when we start doing team fights and you REALLY see how crazy this role can be. \n\nThe Name change is my premise, not the role itself and it's importance","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-02-13T03:03:28.840+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have known this for a while, although it is more true in lower and very high ELO.\n\nGoal one: get the ADC fed.\n\nGoal two: if the ADC cant be saved or is so far ahead they dont need you, show up somewhere unexpectedly and ruin someone's day.\n\nEspecially supports like Bard or Janna, they can do a lot to assist other lanes.\n\nAnd nobody expects Leona to gank mid at 12.","replies":[]},{"poster":"chipndip1","date":"2018-02-13T07:46:26.267+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"No amount of changing the name changes the perception of the role.","replies":[{"poster":"CurS1VE","date":"2018-02-13T07:52:55.883+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"but you don't know that because it hasn't ever been done.
