And i have a few more videos of skt uploaded but they are all spectated through op.gg so they are all replays. And I got an email saying this:\r\n\r\n\"Hello, this is xx, who is in charge of SKT T1 Videos Copyrights.\r\n\r\nI am here to inform you about your illegal usages of SKT T1's copyrights.\r\n\r\nNot only SKT T1's copyrights include its emblems and its players' photos, but also they include the players' highlight/montage videos, streams, and any other VODs related to SKT T1.\r\n\r\nEven the Riot Games, who has the control over fan-created League of Legends contents, officially stated that actions to gain profit by making video contents of any teams' players are prohibited. We already requested Riot Games copyright protection for all SKT T1's spectate videos. Also, Riot Games acknowledged that SKT T1 has the copyright over its players' spectate videos.\r\n\r\nMoreover, your actions violate Republic of Korea's Right of Publicity and copyright laws. If you continue to create and upload more videos of SKT T1, we inform you that the law can take legal actions against your actions.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we ask you to delete the remaining videos of SKT T1's player.\r\n\r\nIf you do not delete the video until this week, Riotgames will take action directly. \"\r\n\r\nSo im wondering if I should delete all skt related stuff now such as replays or maybe even highlights of the LCK streams. Anyone has any idea ?","replies":[{"poster":"Breaku","date":"2017-02-18T17:19:58.553+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why would you think you could upload a video to youtube from somebody else's stream?","replies":[{"poster":"funship","date":"2017-02-18T22:39:33.326+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its also ingame replays through op.gg for other youtubers.

Additionally, if the person who did create it intends to profit off of it, it's well within their rights to protect their creation.\n\nPressing record on Fraps doesn't count as creation, neither does creating highlight reels.","replies":[{"poster":"funship","date":"2017-02-19T10:59:05.120+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok if im in game with faker and i record the replay of it afterwards im fucked. rip.
