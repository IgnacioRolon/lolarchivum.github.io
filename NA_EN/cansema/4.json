Lucian","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] General Discussion","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"i have been noticing his damage out put is extremely high early.. mid .. and late game..\r\n\r\nso.. this whole counter play thing.. can we knee cap him soon or is this going to be a thing now??\r\n\r\ni dont even mind graves damage.... kog&#039;maw.. no problem.. i can see the game verses sacrifice.. \r\nLucian seems to be just oddly over tuned for no reason.. i am pointing him out.. MF is over tuned as well.. but come on..\r\n\r\nhave you seen lucian?\r\n\r\nwhat is the end goal here?? you cannot get all the adc&#039;s to be above a 50% win ratio.. its just not going to happen ..\r\n\r\nlets look at the over all numbers right now\r\n\r\nplay        win\r\n14%     51%  {{champion:236}} \r\n9.5%    47%  {{champion:203}} \r\n10%     47%  {{champion:22}} \r\n25%     47%  {{champion:51}} \r\n6%       48% {{champion:42}} \r\n6.5%    49% {{champion:119}} \r\n10%     46% {{champion:81}} \r\n26.5% 56% {{champion:104}} \r\n23%    50% {{champion:222}} \r\n7%      49% {{champion:429}} \r\n6%      42%  {{champion:96}} \r\n15%    55% {{champion:21}} \r\n9.5%  46.5% {{champion:15}} \r\n17%    51%  {{champion:18}} \r\n3%     47%  {{champion:29}} \r\n&lt;1%   44%  {{champion:6}} \r\n4%     48% {{champion:110}} \r\n27%   49.5% {{champion:67}} \r\n6.5% 48% {{champion:133}} \r\n\r\nas you see the major problems in this are MF, Lucian, Graves.. \r\nnot going to throw stones at graves right now.. but that kit is fun as hell.. \r\nMF we are going to get to her another day..\r\nbut right now.. is that lucian is just stupid good throughout the game.. \r\nno adc should be allowed that mobility with that much damage.. \r\n\r\nHis double tap would be a perfect location to start the nerf stick to get him in a good spot.. \r\n2nd attack on his passive does 50% damage instead of the full damge\r\nthat right there would fix this issue.. and if you dont over tune him to compensate. i will not complain about lucian for awhile..","replies":[]}
