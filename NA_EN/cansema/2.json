Then Blizzard made Burning crusades.  Basically crapped on the old raiding guilds by just giving blues out like candy.  to see a low tier player Purpled out was disheartening.  I played on.  i fought through Wrath.. then Cataclysm hit... Blizzard decided to open up Raids to everyone.  Gear was no longer a statues.  i found my days filled with doing daily&#039;s till my eyes bled.  There was no longer a reason to actually play anymore.  i moved away from WoW cursing Ghost Crawlers name as i left.  I found myself in a game i no longer knew.  The community that i once knew was gone.\n\nI came to league.  Story lines made absolutely no sense.  Pizza feet everywhere.  learning curve beyond reason.  so many broken champions and so many different ways to play them.  A meta was a suggestion.  it was absolute chaos.\n\nNow champions have been stream lined.  few outliers exist now who can be played more than one way.  Game modes where limited beyond the 3v3 or SR.  Quests are starting to form now.  Seems like Riot wants to control their audience instead of just letting us sand box this our way.  Things seemed more transparent back in the day.  The community that i once knew is going away.  \nSivHD....\nDunkey....\nNikasaur.....\nFat Krepo... (Seems skinny krepo has issues)\nMontecristo....\nJoe Miller and Deman.....\n\nThere is a large number of others who have moved on...\n\nWant to tell you what Riot.  Your champions designs are good and you should expand them to some other game spin off and see where that goes.  \n\nBut as for this.... i think its hitting that moment man.. \nto all the new players ... understand this is a normal cycle of games... they evolve and when they start catering to the young they have accepted this is about it.  You too will get old.   \n\ni will be on and off until i am no longer on again...  \n\nTo end this in a quote from the movie &#039;Waiting&#039; : \n&quot;Create your own penis showing game. Metaphorically speaking that is.&quot; - Bishop","replies":[]}
