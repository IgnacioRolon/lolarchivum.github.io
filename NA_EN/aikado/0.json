People like Bulbasaur girl posting a out how OP Nasus is. That one D3 Tryndamere main who talked about how everyone must \"respect their D1 overlords.\" Or Commando Yi, the diamond bruiser Yi main who actually created guides and gave people advice and helped people out. Even that one guy who posted Nasus porn and talked about his fantasies of him all day. \r\n\r\nPeople shitposting all day. That 8 minutes of fame before your post fell to the second page and was never seen again because no one bumped posts. I miss the old community.  The new boards and Reddit just aren't the same :c","replies":[]}
