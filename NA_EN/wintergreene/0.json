I was playing adc and did... fairly good, 15-2-8 with 196 cs on a 32:30 match. So i'm loading in the after game screen, and to be honest i'm not even suprised by what i see.\nA+.\n26-1-2 with 105 cs on a 21:55 min match, with **(MY FIRST BOII)** pentakill.\nA.\n18-2-9 with 180 cs on 29:22...\nA+.\nAm i doing something wrong or is the system broken? It's kind of unfair that i do really well without getting an s. I'm kind of confused on what i should do, i didn't die much, got a good amount of kills... even cs is going pretty well now. \nI'm confused as hell. Can someone help me out?\n\nAnd i've heard about the ideas to go top, too. Just, is there any way to do it in the normal adc way?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-12-20T00:06:41.497+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think Temisto008 offers some good advice, but don't discredit yourself.  I know you're aiming for an S but that's still a good great.  It's just at the moment other players are performing a little better on this champ and role.  Keep at it!","replies":[{"poster":"Wintergreene","date":"2017-12-20T10:11:59.077+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks! There was a point i would have like 70 cs in 20 minutes... horrible. At least i've improved though, and i really feel like i can do something for the team now.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Temisto008","date":"2017-12-19T20:53:14.998+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes you are, your cs is far too low in all of those games. Adc's are meant to some of the highest CS numbers every game. You are meant to have around 180- 200 cs in a 22 minute game.\n\nThey base the grading system off of what other players are averaging on the same champion your playing. So when they get the same score with 100 more cs then you got, thats how they get an S.","replies":[{"poster":"Wintergreene","date":"2017-12-20T10:15:14.525+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And i did have the most cs, but their adc had 50 at 10 mins. ._.

It's just frustrating that lategame i mostly have a lot of teamfights which makes it harder to cs, because mostly i'm fed as hell and so i am important to take the enemy down. At least it's going better than before **dont even mention those times** so i'm happy! Thanks for the help","replies":[]}]}]}
