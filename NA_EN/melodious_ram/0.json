On top of that, since the transition to the new client, I can't even see the club I made. Instead I'm being prompted to create a new club even when my friends can clearly see on their screen that I'm the club owner. Any thoughts on this issue?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-07-27T20:13:35.747+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your club may have lost sync.
