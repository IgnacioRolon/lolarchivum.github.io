The build with Essence Reaver - Infinity Edge - Rapid Firecannon - gets 30% CDR and Mercurial's Edge followed is equivalent and is a bit more defensive than the extra 10% CDR and is a bit stronger too. Sure it's a nice build but Insta Q-Q-AA is usually enough for any Rengar to burst through an ADC regardless of Death's Dance. I've tried many times and even with the passive it's definitely not enough to save the ADC from getting completely bursted, especially with an extra hand from literally anyone else on the enemy team.\n\nI see Death's Dance as more of a Assassin item. The CDR helps with a lot of the poor build path's an Assassin usually takes, Damage reduction helps for getting in and out and subsequently heals whilst in the fray. Extremely potent on Zed whose Ultimate can heal for 500-600 after a full Assassination against one of the carries. Talon also works with this by allowing any diving potential to be relatively safe accounting for basically the same amount of burst and still leaving almost untouched with true stealth provided by Ultimate. With a 30 CD on his ult at level 16 at 40% CDR, he can just wait and do it all over again in no time.\n\nI also see it preforming particularly well with Rengar actually, but there are better items since the way I build him (get 40% CDR ASAP), it doesn't help as much as my main build path (Warrior's JG item - Lucidity boots - Youmuu's - Spirit Visage - Ravenous Hydra - Guardian's Angel/Maw of Malmortius/Infinity Edge), which snowballs pretty well. Enough defences to avoid getting completely downed and subsequently enough one target burst to sustain through at least another carry before dying (or GA's passive get's popped). I tried to fit it in somewhere, removing Spirit Visage seemed to be the best place to put it, it didn't work well against AP carries with sustained damage. I also tried it in Youmuu's position but Youmuu's provided me with the extra MS and AS early to completely stick onto a target outside of bushes and in lane. I tried removing Lucidity Boot's, and built Mercury Boots/Ninja Tabi's/Boots of Swiftness/Boots of Mobility. But the early game boost to CDR was providing me with much more snowball potential given I played particularly average with my team. If I played worse I would still build CDR to shut down the carries given the chance. Death's Dance doesn't provide me with the MS needed and summoner's CD reduction that I absolutely desire over everything. And for the Jungle Item? There's not really an alternative Jungle Item that Rengar preforms well with in terms of assassinating and presence across the map.\n\nI'm waiting for the preseason to end before I start 'adjusting' my build paths more, but at this point I'm fairly certain the Death's Dance doesn't really assist many Champions. I do find building it on one Champion particularly worth, Varus. A Q from him heals a pretty big portion of his health, and since he can sustain without being in the fray this item preforms insanely well with him.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TaoistMaster","date":"2015-12-30T16:29:03.642+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:266}} sweet","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Athenes Lulu","date":"2015-12-30T16:30:55.158+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Though you have one job, at least stand at a place where we can CATCH Rengar and save you if he ever shows up.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Universal Boop","date":"2015-12-30T11:00:29.049+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i just end up buying zhonyas on my adc it surprisingly works","replies":[]},{"poster":"MrDrBudd","date":"2015-12-30T20:32:54.748+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"There IS a lot you can do but you guys just act like sheep and refuse to learn so down vote away.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tails Doll","date":"2015-12-30T18:59:06.624+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Just pink the spear man, it's not that hard.","replies":[]}]}
