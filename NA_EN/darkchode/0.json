I cannot click to move, buy from the shop, etc. Nothing i click on responds (it is not a problem with my mouse). I can talk in the chat and watch the game but simply cannot click on anything. I am fairly new and have been playing these last few weeks and this started a few days ago.\r\nI have deleted specific files and then ran the repair tool as some youtube videos have said to do with no success. Last night i deleted the game entirely and reinstalled it with no luck. I really enjoy playing this game when i have some down time and would appreciate any suggestions beyond that.\r\n\r\nThank you very much","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-17T22:34:39.809+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you're having a freezing issue here.  I know you've tried some steps here but some of these, like deleting files, can end up causing you more issues.  If you have windows 10, an update auto-enabled the [Xbox Game Bar](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html).  Disabling that should resolving the freeze.  From here on, don't modify or delete any files unless specified to make sure things are in running order.  Let me know if that helps.","replies":[{"poster":"DarkChode","date":"2016-12-18T01:41:00.670+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello, thanks for the reply.\n\nI am running Windows 7 so I don't think that is the problem. \n\nI am unfamiliar with the \"Xbox Game Bar\", so if you think that still may be my problem on Windows 7, let me know.\nIf not, any other suggestions?\n\nAlso, not trying to rule anything out here, I'm sure you know much more about this stuff than i do, but could it be considered \"freezing\" when literally everything in game continues on? I can still watch teammates carry on with the game (and even chat with them), i just cant move.\n\nThank you again for the reply, lol. I've found very few instances of people having this problem from hours of googling, and even those did not have any helpful solutions.","replies":[]}]}]}
