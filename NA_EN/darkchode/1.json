I have played for about a month with no problem until about a week ago. I got into a game and was unable to click anything. I could not move, open the shop, etc. My clicks were unresponsive. I could still stand there and watch the game go on and chat with teammates, but simply could not click anything. This has happened in every game I have entered since. (not a mouse problem)\r\nI just reinstalled league for the 3rd time with no luck, and have ran the repair tool countless times.\r\n\r\nI am running Windows 7, Service Pack 1. A few times (I think most if not every time has been straight after reinstalling) I have gotten a message stating that League will no longer support Windows XP Service Pack 2 after June 1, 2016 and that my computer uses Service Pack 2. This is strange because 1) I do not run Windows XP Service Pack 2, and 2) Its long past June 1st, and i had no problems up until recently.\r\n\r\nidk if the service pack thing has anything to do with this but i figured it was worth noting.\r\nI made a similar post a few days ago but received no help. Any suggestions would be GREATLY appreciated.\r\nThank you very much.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-21T18:02:29.232+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's important to get your Windows updated to prevent issues or interruptions, but I'm not sure if that's causing your unresponsive inputs.  You could also have a corrupt config, which can happen especially if manual modifications are made.  To be sure, try resetting your configuration folder but keep in mind you'll need redo your bindings:\n\n **Log into the game** then hop into **a custom game**. *Alt+Tab* out of the match, then navigate to your League installation folder, which should be in C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\n\nDelete the folder named **Config**\n\nOnce you've deleted the folder, leave the custom match. You'll then want to hop into another custom match to confirm the changes were saved.\n\nI hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
