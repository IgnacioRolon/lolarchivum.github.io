(sitting there for 30+ seconds, often on team pushes or dragon)\r\n\r\nyou say something, tell them to stop going afk or to slow down their aggressive diving, you&#039;re considered the troll. Are you supposed to just sit there twiddling your thumbs as a player intentionally ruins your game and wastes an hour of your time? Has there ever been a response by riot on their broken tribunal system and made up &quot;toxic&quot; standards?\r\n\r\njust wondering, the system seems designed for simple folk who get offended by everything, including their own lack of intelligence","replies":[]}
