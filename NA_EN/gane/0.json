One of my team mates banned graves. This guy then said in champ select chat (which is a whole different issue of not being policed), &quot;you just banned my champ? GG enjoy the loss. I&#039;m on my smurf account because my main is banned for 14 days. I dont give a fck about this account. I am running mid, enjoy&quot;\r\n\r\nHe literally ran down mid over and over and intentionally fed and lost the game for our team.\r\n\r\nObviously he got reports from whoever was not lazy enough to submit one, but sometimes the winning team doesn&#039;t care (FREELO!!!!!!!!)\r\n\r\nI don&#039;t have much hope that this account or his main will be permanently banned (obviously he does this all the time), so I&#039;m suggesting a deterrent for toxic players.\r\n\r\nThis is probably more rampant than most people realize. This guy can just make a new account until it&#039;s banned, and repeat, OVER AND OVER. Tyler1 had 28 accounts perma banned before a lifelong ban. Seriously, 28 accounts perma banned?\r\n\r\n**Couple of suggestions**\r\n\r\n* I actually saw this suggestion on the boards today. Why not simply disallow anyone to log in to an account that is not associated to a CD KEY? You could for instance, charge $20 for a CD KEY that can be associated with 3 accounts. People could still smurf and make new accounts to try different strategies out in ranked. CD KEY sharing could happen like netflix, but all people would risk getting their key banned if any person sharing the key is reported. This should be retroactive. All current players must purchase a CD KEY and register it to their accounts to play. The money generated instantly (millions) could even be added to the worlds/tournament prize pools (this has been a complaint in the community for quite a while that the prize pools do not compare to CS/DOTA).\r\n\r\n* This is just an idea, and could be implemented a variety of ways. You could still make league of legends completely free to play, but you can only unlock the ability to use skins with a CD KEY. Or, you could unlock the ability to play ranked with a CD key, etc.\r\n\r\n* Another suggestion is to tie accounts to phone numbers. There are services that allow you to determine if a phone number provided is a real actual cell phone number registered to a person or a landline, and not a VOIP generated skype/google voice number. Google/Microsoft and a bunch of other large players now use cell phone numbers for authentication (text auth) and verification of a person. This works very well. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is currently no incentive for a player to not act toxic/have a tantrum if they do not get their way, other than leveling up a new account and losing any $ from skins.

Charging for a free to play game is not an option espeically when the biggest competition is also free to play.\n\nFor the second suggestion; \n\nThis doesn't the intentionally feeding problem.\nPeople who don't care about the account would simply not buy the CD key and continue to intentionally feed, they just couldn't do it in ranked.\nMeanwhile, you just told people who don't have a disposable income to spend on the game that they're not allowed to play ranked.\n\nFor the third suggestion;\nPeople are adverse to giving away personal information for something that they're not sure of yet, so this would drive away many customers. Plus the inconvenience of activating it would drive some people away too.\n","replies":[{"poster":"GANE","date":"2017-03-01T21:04:51.812+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you have any suggestions to keep players like the one I described and other examples of players like tyler1 from continuously creating accounts? These players are playing for months for dozens of games, while climbing as high as Challenger before riots system gets them banned. I'm not sure how effective the banning system is as it stands. Tyler1 still plays. You cannot keep a toxic player with 30+ banned accounts from simply creating new accounts and playing. He has a lifelong ban and yet still plays everyday. Riots only solution to this if he is ever \"discovered\" playing he will be banned again. This is normally only possible if he streams. Obviously for a normal player, it would not be hard to remain anonymous.","replies":[{"poster":"AeroWaffle","date":"2017-03-01T21:25:06.517+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The sad matter is, you can't while maintaining the F2P business model.\n\nWhen people are determined to troll, many times even charging money for the game is unlikely to bother them much.

This is just an attempt to keep it out of the competitive mode of league where people are trying to climb the ladder. Also, that was just one idea that has worked for other gaming communities over the years. The other suggestion I provided was to link your account to a phone number. This would also be highly effective and I do not think would alienate the player base based on income. You could use any phone number. If you or your family do not have a phone, but you have internet and playing ranked in league (???), you could use a library phone number, work phone number, friends phone number, any phone number. \n\nIf you don't have a computer or an internet connection you're not allowed to play league of legends either, so I'm not really sure that is a valid argument.

You need players to consistently report toxic/bad behavior. I highly doubt all 9 players in my game reported the int trolling teemo, as many would forget/be too lazy, especially the enemy team. If you just got freelo, sometimes it's easy to forget to report, as he just got you an easy win. It seems you can very easily climb to challenger before you are permanently banned.

Once they are reported frequently enough the IFS checks all of the games they were reported in, and multiple reports can't make the system check them any harder. You don't need anyone but yourself to report them for an individual game.\n\nAs for tying your account to a phone number,  that would disallow anyone who chooses not to have a phone from playing.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2017-03-01T21:14:44.595+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let's also keep in mind that pay-to-play keys create a market for third party reselling, which is against the Terms of Use and will always be wrought with scams.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Warlord Scrap","date":"2017-03-01T20:50:13.400+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"one of the big draws of league is its free to play and free to win and now you want the game to cos 20 dollars.","replies":[]}]}
