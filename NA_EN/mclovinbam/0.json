I'm new to this 'thread' and 'asking for help' so I didn't know any other way to contact you. \nI'm experiencing patching difficulties since the latest patch 6.21 was released. Problem being 'Unexpected error check logs'.\nTried all night looking for solutions and that is when I found your 'page' you created to help with patching difficulties. \nI tried everything you mentioned there but nothing helped. Ultimately, i un-installed league and re-installed and that doesnt work either.\nI feel really down at the moment since league is the only game I play. \nI REALLY HOPE YOU READ THIS MESSAGE! \nHelp me Wuks!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-11T22:21:37.597+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There was a [service incident](http://forums.xfinity.com/t5/X1/TV-Service-Interruption-10-11-2016/td-p/2813767) that Comcast experienced that affected certain players across the US.
