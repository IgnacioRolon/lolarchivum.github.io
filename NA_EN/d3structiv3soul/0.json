Should it not be a permanent mute?","subforum":"Player Behavior","up_votes":4,"down_votes":13,"body":"Recently banned for offensive language on my only account I&#039;ve had for years. \r\nI recently had a family member die and I can say i&#039;ve been in a bad place and it does not help that i have my fathers temper so yes I have been more then a little bit angry, but i would rather take that out over a game with typing but even then its usually to people that deserve it then walk out side and take it out on someone face to face.\r\nTo ban a person from chat seems like the proper response to me for verbal problems if it seems a person cant stop talking their rights to do so in-game should be taken away. But to permanently ban an account you have put hundreds of hours or in my case thousands and hundreds of my hard earned cash into for talking? \r\nNo permanent bans should be for people that hack the system cheat consistently afk, not for someone that has keyboard rage. But hey they tell you make a new account! You&#039;re more then welcome to do so...... so yea take all of my work all of the cash i spent and try to make me do it again? I wish I had never started playing league of legends they basically do what they want and say they do it from feedback? Please prove that the community asked for such a harsh system that  doesn&#039;t work half as well as the statistics they say, Can you prove these statistics? Or are you just making them up on the spot riot?\r\nYou know I get it you&#039;re trying to make a positive community but quiet honestly you&#039;re doing quite the opposite.\r\nFor example you have a 4 made pre-made lets say and they right from the start call you names tell you you&#039;re usless and you mute them. K then they start ruining your game by afking and leaving you to die in team fights and you&#039;re angry but you have to keep playing.Then the games over you report them but the four of them report you and you get a warning 5 game chat 40 w/e your level might be. next game you get someone that lose&#039;s their lane starts cussing at you and you have had enough tell them to **** off,Btw before you ban me from here too those were *&#039;s, they report you and boom. Especially in ranked this happens to be the worst play for it. You know what though if league of legends thinks their system works why dont you look at games like smite Heros of the strom and runecape with proper chat filters or communicating with quick chat rather then letting people add an extra letter to swear. But they say they are looking out for the player but in reality its a company they&#039;re looking at their wallets with little to no concern for the average player, tell me any different but have proof of it.\r\nBut hey the group of people that all got me banned good 8/10 of they swore at me or told me to kill my self or that they would harm or kill my family ganged up on me but hey riot I deserve the ban when i told them to go away in a much more rude manner.\r\nThem telling me to kill myself never made me want to, losing the only account i have with every champion over 100 skins thousands of hours put into it that makes me want to.","replies":[{"poster":"EvilDustMan","date":"2016-10-13T10:09:33.692+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am sorry that you had a family member die but two things. \n\nYou shouldn't have taken it out on ANYONE.\n\nWhat about the previous 3 punishments?

My sister in law died 9 months ago. I've dealt with a lot of death too, and the truth is, that really isn't an excuse. If you have the kind of anger that you can't help but explode somewhere, you need to talk to someone, not take it out on anon people online.\n\nBeyond that, I completely back up the banning of extremely negative chat people. The internet has no free speech. We all joined the site and agreed to try to be civil. There's a lot of toxic people out there, but responding to negative chat and trolling by similar negative chat and trolling, then you're as bad as they are. It's just make you another person raging on a team, which makes everyone play worse as a whole. There's mute abilities for a reason. I was introduced to league by people who's reaction to bad players WAS to be that \"go kill yourself\" mentality and it took me a couple of months to realize that's no appropriate. It's a game. \n\nIm a support main. I once had a game where I chose a Soraka rather than Blitz, when adc asked. I immediatly started getting flamed. When my adc made a terrible call level 1, they blamed me. I muted the two being rude and just dug in and we won.

If were here to play a game there should be no chat box, if you want to talk use skype or discord. and dont say for people that dont because they have quick pings.","replies":[{"poster":"Lunar Cookie","date":"2016-10-13T16:48:05.032+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Quick pings doesnt allow you to set up good plays, like suggesting baits or talking out ideas. It's not Riot's fault that people are toxic. The internet allows people the ability to be jerks and feel as if there's no consequences to their actions. If you get any group large enough, a good number of them are going to be rude. At the amount that plays LoL, you have a lot. Worse yet, then popular people start being rude and making that seem like the \"okay\" thing to do and Riot is left with very few options.\n\n\nChat restrictions are their warnings. Truthfully, you seem intent on refusing any of YOUR part on these actions, opting instead to blame Riot. It's not Riot's job to prevent you from continually breaking rules by being rude. YOU chose to be toxic. YOU chose to go off on people instead of muting. YOU chose to ignore their multiple warnings of your behaviour. Riot is not a some evil corporation out to ban innocent people who mess you. You repeatedly chose to break the rules and they will not punish ALL players by removing chat because some don't know how to chat without going over lines. The easier and wiser decision isn't to remove chat, but remove the people who can't use it properly. So they did, with a ban","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Ast√¥lfo","date":"2016-10-13T14:11:55.477+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Toxic players do not deserve to enjoy the privilege of playing League.\nNo one cares how much money or time you spent.

Riot definitely needs to take away the ability for people to do whatever they want in chat. Most people, even non toxic people don't use the chat system for intricate plays, it's just useless all together. \"Gg ez, glhf, nice skin\" it's all pointless. And no matter what the community is split by non toxic people and toxic people where the toxic people are completely exhiled by the non toxics. No one cares to  understand the toxicity unless they are toxic already, and 9/10 that person doesn't even want to be toxic. And if the person doesn't want to be anymore, I feel like Riot doesn't provide the proper tools to the person to not be. Restrictions dont work, banning dont work, they should remove the free communication from the game. Which I realize that it originally comes from the person being toxic, BUT in return with a game this big, it seems  like they chose the easiest route that they benefit from and leave it's players unsatisfied and unhelped. This game is some people's entire life, and I feel like from a certain level riot should respect that and think of better ways of tackling this toxic problem than taking so much away from that individual. \n\nHowever, if a quick chat system isnt in the cards, there is a MUTE button that no one seems to care about. They'd rather just report.  Some people need to vent. So just mute them. Or If riot could let a player mute themselves, then the people who actually want to change has a tool to help them. And the people who still cause problems when toxic players have the tools to help themselves, then they deserve the bans. \n\nIf riot doesn't release something in these areas in the new season then I have to agree with the original post, that they just want more money for a toxic player to rebuild a different account then actually caring for the people who contribute to their game. Which I don't know why you wouldn't want any and all people to play when an easy fix is closer than they make it seem.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"dominusx","date":"2016-10-13T10:04:55.822+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":10,"body":"It only matters if you talk a little boo boo for them to ban you. they dont wanna hurt all the kids that flooded the game and scar them by bullying.
