Or is the back and forth pattern just for thematic reasons?","replies":[{"poster":"Kid Freljord","date":"2014-11-06T18:58:07.054+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Think of it like a vision zoning tool.

You can have up to two charges, but they generate every 60 seconds, and it has a 30 second CD between cast.  The charge rate doesn't scale on CDR either.\n\nFrom the PBE game I got of em, they are great for facechecking objectives and grabbing bush control away from the enemy, or as a weak vision alternative for the river (If you use your W right, it can set up 100% vision uptime for a small area in combination with your trinket, until an enemy passes through it's sight .   It's pretty easy to deny her this vision, but it is ok for a warning/facecheck.","replies":[{"poster":"Season 9 Amumu","date":"2014-11-06T20:04:40.305+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"seems a bit weird, why not just have one cast every 30 seconds, two charges in this case seems irrelevant","replies":[]},{"poster":"SouL1ess","date":"2014-11-06T23:45:09.733+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why does it have a 30 second CD on top of a 2-charge system?\n\nThe point of a charge-based system is that you can cast the skill in quick succession as long as charges remain. To compensate, a longer charge-regain timer is added to the skill. \n\nThere is no reason to have it charge based while having a long CD as well - unless Certainlyt considered the 30 second CD to be the \"quick succession\" timeframe, and the 60- seecond recharge to be the \"long charge-regain timer\" timeframe.","replies":[{"poster":"Narasimha","date":"2014-11-07T19:59:46.354+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In this scenario, its more of an 'ammo' system. Rather than for quick use, its so you can place sentinels at multiple locations.

I don't think it can detect things that are already stealthed, either. Still, it's surprisingly useful.\n\nIt still lets the whole map know you done goofed if it catches you, and it's probably harder to evade than a stationary ward in some instances, and unlike in the Metal Gear series, there's no way to take it out without alerting the enemy.\n\nAt worst, the fact that it went dark early means a gank is incoming along or near its route. At best, its presence forces an enemy jungler to evade it, and thus gank in a manner which a canny team can predict and counter.\n\nAlso, it can be used offensively to provide vision for long-range spells/skills.\n\nAnd of course, its passive encourages some nifty comps and combos by taking a lot of offensive pressure off of the support role. The potential of proc'ing Concussive Blows and Soul Bound at the same time is a sobering thought. Braum and other CC tanks also help Kalista's ult by not only surviving it, but in effect prolonging it.\n\nGoing off on a tangent here, but Braum and Kalista look like they go together, like *spear and shield*, one might say. Braum's slows and stuns would let Kalista kite and stack for Rend, and Soul Bound and Rend could deal enough damage that Braum would just need to land Concussive Blows/CC and defend with Unbreakable/Stand Behind Me.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2014-11-06T18:55:34.841+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think her Sentinel is a great vision tool. Sure, it is predictable in how it sees, but it also adds danger to the jungle, as they have not only stationary hidden wards to deal with, but a mobile ward that they have to actively try to move around, as it can't be deactivated by trinkets and forces them to stop and engage it if they wish to remove it, wasting their precious time in the jungle. It has a lot of unique potential that other vision skills don't offer, and the added bonus of it screeching and pursuing enemies it sees gives you a lot more visual knowledge than other wards give, and it lets your team keep track of an actual direction that a potential ganker is moving.","replies":[]},{"poster":"a call beyond","date":"2014-11-06T18:50:07.908+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"she's plenty strong with just her passive, even without her W and R","replies":[]},{"poster":"ProfDrDeath","date":"2014-11-06T17:11:12.134+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"We don't know yet - the sight cone part isn't active on the PBE.\n\nHowever, the Sentinel's trade-off for being abled to be killed and having limited vision radius lies in the fact that it has a huge uptime.
