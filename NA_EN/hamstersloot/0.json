Sorry, but the perfect 0/0/ALLTEAMKILLS score is really hard to achieve. And when your support gets a quadra kill in a team fight, be happy they shut down someone who is \"unstoppable\" and turned the game in your team's favor rather than rage at them. Supports are supposed to support the team, I get it, but when we get kills, trust me, we don't purposely try and KS from you, and we're trying to help.","replies":[{"poster":"Solari Fortune","date":"2015-05-23T15:38:04.847+0000","up_votes":34,"down_votes":1,"body":"As an ADC main i don't care if I get the kill or you get the kill.
