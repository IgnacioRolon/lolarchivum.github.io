You said you want to respect those players' investments so the skin won't return. Then why are the skins being made purchase able in the Chinese servers??  According to reliable Chinese leaks, the even pass skins will be made purchase-able as the 2020 spring event for around 1500 yuan around $200 USD (https://v.douyin.com/qNHXVj/). With this coming out in china it is totally not fair for us. What is different between the other server players and Chinses players? We are with in the league community we are all league of legends lovers. There are so many players that were kept away by life from the event pass that would gladly purchase the skin for their main champion, and for players who worked hard for the skins, they have received the skin way earlier than those who want to purchase and acquired the border for the skin as well which will not be obtained by buyers. It is not like people who put in the effort the prestige skin didn't get anything in return, and within the Prestige Updates, (https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/features/prestige-updates) many skin obtainers have commented they would not mind for the event pass skins to be made purchase-able for other players who have missed the event at the end of the year. Personally I own 8 out of 9 event prestige skins and I have missed K/DA Prestige Kai'sa due to College and life-changing events that have happened and I was so disappointed that I couldn't participate in the event. Not only me so many league lovers would gladly work for the skin but were kept away. So PLEASE Riot, give us what we want.","replies":[]}
