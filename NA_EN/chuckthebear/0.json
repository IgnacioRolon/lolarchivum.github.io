After a reboot the launch screen would appear however, when launch is pressed, the window minimizes/closes and nothing happens.\r\n\r\nI have tried switching servers and downloading the patch, when launch is pressed nothing happens.  Switching back, nothing happens.  I tried the thereisnourflevel on the launch screen after a friends suggestion.  I reinstalled and repeated the above.  Game still does not want to launch.","replies":[{"poster":"Digital Ram","date":"2015-01-14T01:49:58.751+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Chuckthebear,\n\nThis issue generally happens when you're not launching as an Administrator. The game does require Admin privileges to work properly. You can set up administrative mode by following these steps:\n\n- Right-Click the Launcher. This will bring up a drop-down menu.\n- Select the Properties option on the drop-down menu.\n- Click the Compatibility Tab.\n- Check the box that reads \"Run this program as an administrator\"\n- Click the Apply button\n\nAfter that, launch the game! Let me know if this works for you!","replies":[{"poster":"KingShakalaka","date":"2015-10-05T23:21:54.394+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When I open league of legends...it shows the bi league of legends logo in middle....and just lags to load the launch state but lags like 5 minutes...and when it loads to login the maestro error occurs...help???","replies":[]},{"poster":"chuckthebear","date":"2015-01-14T10:54:58.080+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Digital Ram,\n\nThanks for the quick reply.  \n\nI made the suggested changes however the issue was not remedied.
