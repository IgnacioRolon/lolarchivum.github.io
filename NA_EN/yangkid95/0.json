Interfering with gameplay","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, so I recently got back into play LoL and for some odd reason maybe yesterday or a few days ago, I've been randomly getting this random bug where my game's click animation turns red instead of green and I can't control my champion and he runs off and attacks any nearby minions/champs. I know how to fix it but, it interferes with the gameplay and has costed me numerous games because of this bug. I needed to alt tab and re-enter the game in order for it to fix itself. Please help me find a better solution or a complete solution to this bug. Thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-13T23:06:46.079+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had to do some testing, but when you click and the arrows are red it means you're using the \"attack-move\" feature. Basically, it means your champion will move to that location but attack anything within range along the way. Usually, you can use the attack-move command by hitting the \"A\" key then clicking.\n\nI'm curious if the hotkey for move-attack was possibly changed and you're hitting it by accident. Check out what you currently have bound to that command, then see if changing it has any effect and let me know if that helps!","replies":[]}]}
