It was on the &quot;Blood Moon Zilean{{champion:26}} &quot; skin that the bug happened and it was normal on other zilean skins, should not be anything wrong with my computer just it looks like a game bug.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2018-04-10T22:29:18.392+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi! We've been investigating this, and it looks to occur on all skins. ;-; From what we've seen, it's an engineering issue and not directly tied to VFX. We have an engineering digging into it!","replies":[]}]}
