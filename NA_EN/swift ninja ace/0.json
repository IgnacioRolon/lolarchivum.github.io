I recommend completing a reset with the steps below:\n\nFirst, you'll want to **log into the game** then hop into **a custom game**. ​*Alt+Tab*​ out of the match, then navigate to your League installation folder, which should be in **C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends**\n\nDelete the folder named **Config**\n\nOnce you've deleted the folder, leave the custom match. You'll then want to hop into another custom match to confirm the changes were saved.\n\nLet me know if this helped.","replies":[{"poster":"Swift Ninja Ace","date":"2016-08-03T21:36:07.900+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It didn't work :(","replies":[]},{"poster":"Swift Ninja Ace","date":"2016-08-03T04:32:48.817+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its not working still :1","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-03T15:55:13.688+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since the config reset didn't fix it, there may be some local settings or changes that can be made.
