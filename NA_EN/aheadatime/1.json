{"poster":"Aheadatime","date":"2016-06-01T03:23:11.748+0000","title":"Response to Dynamic Queue Roundtable","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":77,"down_votes":6,"body":"Link for those who haven&#039;t seen it yet - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwPa1SGLGv0\n\nAs a solo player, I&#039;ve watched the video in &#039;silent mode&#039;, simply observing and listening. No rage, no tears. Absorbed the content and the points made. Now that I&#039;ve thought it through, I&#039;m going to share my general thoughts on the matter along with some more specific responses at points made within the video. Community and Rioter feedback very much welcome.\n\n&gt; **General Thoughts**\n\n-------------------------_**The Crux of DQ**_-------------------------\n\nRiot&#039;s main goal behind creating and maintaining Dynamic Queue (hereby referred to as DQ) at the cost of removing Solo Queue (hereby referred to as SQ) was, and still is, to promote more teamwork. I have two issues with this point.\n\n**1.** This is a change that seemingly nobody has asked for. I can&#039;t recall seeing popular threads on the boards about wanting this type of system. I haven&#039;t run into any players in-game voicing their desire for a pre-made style ranked queue. I don&#039;t have any irl league friends who have ever mentioned any flaws with the old SQ, or mentioned to me that they&#039;d like to play as a group of 3 or 4 in ranked (which is the size that we usually queue up as in norms). While making an &#039;unrequsted&#039; change can bring good, it also has great potential (so far being realized) to bring with it unnecessary conflict, displacement, and unforeseen issues. \n\n**2.** I question whether or not more teamwork has been added. How can such a factor be measured or quantified? Pings per game? Wards placed? Assists? Honoring? These are all weak metrics to base upon. Teamwork is inherently, for the most part, an immeasurable factor. Pings would happen more frequently on a non-pre-made team, as they lack voice chat. Wards placed more strongly correlates to general ladder placement. Assists directly depend upon total kills, which strongly relates to ladder placement. Honoring isn&#039;t worth mentioning. There are no known ways of identifying objectively whether or not more teamwork has been added via DQ. \n\nMoreover, DQ brings with it the potential for a different kind of teamwork. If I am solo with a 3 or 4-man on my team, it is generally assumed that they will be calling the shots. They have more voices, more pings, and will follow one another in-game. Thus, I am strongly incentivized to follow suit. This coerced version of teamwork doesn&#039;t feel good, and was much, much less present in SQ. I&#039;m particularly sensitive to this new type of teamwork, as I&#039;ve historically assumed the position of shotcaller in SQ.\n\n-------------------------_**Communication**_-------------------------\n\nI genuinely appreciate this video. The fact that we are given some very concrete stances and thoughts of Riot employees is refreshing and welcome. I would love to see monthly or bi-monthly updates in the same fashion. My issue is that I don&#039;t think I will. This video is in regards to a topic that involves an overwhelming amount of community backlash. While the video is welcome, it doesn&#039;t bode well with me that it apparently requires this much attention and negativity towards a particular topic to elicit a response from Riot. Please keep your intentions and plans more clear with the playerbase guys. This is perhaps the biggest factor in how the playerbase judges/views you as a company, which in turn dictates how they feel about your product. We want to stay informed and up to date, even if we&#039;re hearing things that don&#039;t sit well with us.\n\nIt&#039;s nice that you guys admit when you mess up with communication, but it doesn&#039;t make us any less annoyed that the lacking took place. Many of your players are intelligent people; college grads, professors, engineers, writers, designers, etc. We can all agree that given your company&#039;s multi-million dollar worth, your lack of proper communication is unwarranted and unprofessional. It is not costly or overly complex to hire a &#039;community manager&#039; who&#039;s sole job is to gather data from various Riot departments and compile a monthly update vlog to be released on the client and website. \n\nThat wraps is up for my general thoughts, onto the more specific ones.\n\n&gt; _**Specific Thoughts**_\n\nMy personal opinion is that DQ is an overall failure of a change, and a pure SQ would be the most accurate representation of a competitive atmosphere. With that in mind, I&#039;d like to focus on some more specific points being made in the video.\n\n\n-------------------------_**The 3 Matchmaking Factors**_-------------------------\n\nSpeed, accuracy (or quality), and role selection were labeled as _the_ 3 qualities that matchmaking should obtain. What was essentially agreed upon was that speed and accuracy are more important than role selection, and both of these factors are lacking atm. This wouldn&#039;t be the case with a pure SQ. I think it&#039;s quite obvious that within a pure SQ, matchmaking would struggle with less &#039;attempt layers&#039; (meaning parameters that need to be met to get the game going) since matching pre-mades with pre-mades of a similar size is no longer needed. It would also make the accuracy of the matches more consistent, and this is an important point that wasn&#039;t discussed thoroughly. I&#039;ll explain below.\n\n-------------------------**_Fair Games_**-------------------------\n\nAt one point, Lobster mentioned that pitting a 5-man against a team of 5 equally skilled solo players is a &quot;fair game&quot;, as both teams have an equal chance to win the game. I can&#039;t help but call bullshit on this. At any elo, a 5-man inherently has higher chances of beating 5 solos due to the overwhelming communication advantage. The 5-man has (most usually) played games together before, and have thus learned one another&#039;s playstyles and skillsets. They have a general victory path that may involve particular objective control, rotation, or repeat-ganks. The 5 solos do not have this experience and history together. They don&#039;t have a pre-established plan to 4-man gank bot one minute before dragon spawns, nor do they know before the game starts that top will be ganked three times before level six. I&#039;m honestly completely surprised that Lobster didn&#039;t seem to either understand or agree with this point, which is perhaps the biggest issue the playerbase has with DQ. Pre-mades have an advantage over solos, which just isn&#039;t fair.\n\n-------------------------_**Queue Times**_-------------------------\n\nQueue times were talked about quite alot in this video, probably in-part due to Scarra voicing his annoyances. So what goes into queue times? \n\n- Number of players queued at any given time\n- Matching players of similar elo\n- Matching players of same/similar party size\n- Matching allies of opposing roles (not matching a mid with another mid)\n\nI&#039;m going to assume that the first two are not issues, as there are millions of League players divided into every elo bracket. So queue times essentially rely on the role selection process and matching pre-mades with pre-mades. My opinion is that the role selection is less of an issue here than are the pre-mades. Let me explain why. I was a big Teambuilder (TB) fan, and although the queue times could be harsh for mid, they weren&#039;t that bad overall. Now, I think it&#039;s safe to say that there were more people playing SQ than TB. In theory, a ranked Solo TB should be exponentially faster than the previous rendition for the following reasons;\n\n- Solo TB population consists of previous SQ population (larger number of players in the system than previous TB, decreasing queue times)\n- Removal of previous TB incentivizes TB players to join DQ, strengthening above point\n- Provides a secondary role option to hasten matchmaking (larger number of potential matches decreases queue times)\n\nYet we&#039;re seeing queue times on par with some of the old TB queue times. Logically, it _must_ stem from the pre-made system. My thoughts are that this pre-made attempt layer is causing the bulk of the queue time issues with DQ, and it&#039;s not something that can really be fixed outside of getting a large increase in the number of players in the system. As mentioned in the video, Riot cannot give any more slack to the algorithms pertaining to elo placement without creating wildly mismatched games. The only other way to decrease queue times within the DQ parameters would then be to give some more slack to the pre-made attempt layer, meaning allowing situations like 4&#039;s or 5&#039;s vs 5 solos to be more common, which is quite plainly.. bullshit. I maintain that a pure SQ wouldn&#039;t be suffering these queue time issues, despite introducing the role selection feature.\n\n-------------------------_**Toxicity**_-------------------------\n\nSocrates made it a point when asked plainly, &#039;Why introduce DQ?&#039;, to mention that toxicity has decreased with DQ&#039;s introduction. He specifically stated that 5&#039;s and 4&#039;s see less toxicity on average than SQ used to. This point is moot imo, as it&#039;s quite.. erm.. obvious. If I&#039;m playing a pre-made with my 3 irl league friends in chat, I don&#039;t type out their mistakes or my annoyances with the enemy. I just say it in chat. I&#039;m provided with less reason to get upset over shotcalling given our collective plans. These things are obvious.\n\nToxicity stems from strangers interacting anonymously in a competitive atmosphere, bottom line. You don&#039;t solve that by removing the &#039;strangers&#039; part of the equation. The issue is still there in games where there are 5 solos. The issue is still there in ARAM. The issue is still there in post-chat. The issue is still there even in DQ. The way to solve this issue is by cracking down harder and faster on toxicity itself. Being less lenient with the warning/banning system. Being less lenient with the number of reports it takes for a player to receive a review. Letting the player know the instant he/she gets a report so he/she knows that it only takes a few more before a review. This is how you deal with toxicity, by cracking down on it. Not by implementing a system that comes with a set of completely new flaws (queue times, pre-made advantages, loss of solo player impact, boosters).\n\n-------------------------_**Solo Accomplishment**_-------------------------\n\nGbay mentioned that with DQ, solo players feel, and are, less impactful overall to the outcome of their games. Socrates agreed, and stated that this is a necessity of more team-oriented gameplay, which Riot is looking to achieve. That was painful to hear. You guys might have plans to improve upon this with perhaps a nice little badge or a splash art border, but I don&#039;t see how you can possibly solve the _actual_ issue; solo players feel left out because they **_are_** left out. That&#039;s just not cool. Pre-mades historically have had many options; 5-man ranked, ARAM, blind, and rotation queues. They don&#039;t also need SQ to be declared as their territory as well. You have millions of solo players, and the implementation of DQ inherently goes against their general enjoyment of the game. I don&#039;t think this is something that can be remedied outside of a pure SQ, as we solo players don&#039;t want a badge or icon or whatever, we want to be impactful in every game we queue up in.\n\n&gt; **_In Conclusion_**\n\nWell that about sums it up. I&#039;m happy that we got to listen in on this conversation, and that there were different opinions present at the discussion. I think more of this in the future would do everyone good. My personal thoughts, if they weren&#039;t clear already, are that we should be given a pure SQ and a pure 5-man queue in ranked, with nothing in between. DQ creates too many issues for a goal that was never really asked for by the community. The trade-off is illogical and hard to fathom. SQ would solve the issues of...\n\n- Queue time\n- Accurate match-ups\n- Accurate elo representation\n- Solo player impact\n\n...while DQ only solves the issue of;\n\n- Friends wanting to play ranked as a 3 or 4-man\n\nIt&#039;s hard to understand that tradeoff man.","replies":[{"poster":"MIRKY","date":"2016-06-01T04:35:31.386+0000","up_votes":24,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can I just say that i respect you so much for not making this another \n\"WAW RITO FUCK YOU GG I HATE YOU IM SO BUYING OVERWATHC NOW\" posts :l","replies":[{"poster":"Aheadatime","date":"2016-06-01T13:49:52.750+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks man.

If there is even a single outsider, there's potential dispute between them and any premade member, or visa versa. Unless Riot wants to make the game 5v5 only, premades do not lower toxicity.

Contrast this to Solo Queue, where you \"have to\" play a Carry to climb and there's no incentive to Support. \n\nQueue times matching Team Builder times is because Riot utterly failed with the Fill position and Support Secondary. In Blind Pick and old Draft, Fill is random (if you don't believe me, play 10 games). In new Draft, Fill is always Support and Support secondary is always Support. This causes people who don't always want to Support to not pick them, causing a shortage of Supports, causing longer queue times. If from the get go you wouldn't get Support more than 50% of the time with these options we'd have shorter queue times, but months after release Riot's solution is to strong arm people into the position...","replies":[{"poster":"Aheadatime","date":"2016-06-01T14:42:38.904+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"'In a premade, you've got players that want to duo bot'. \n\nSure, but not all the time.

Most DQ supports I run into are stuck there via fill, with the occasional duo. Not all of them, but alot of them. Personally, I got from unranked to gold supporting. Yes, I needed to start maining top and jng to get from gold to plat, but alot of players realize they can climb through support, and would do so in the old SQ.\n\nAnother thing you're missing out on is that a lot of support players don't enjoy queueing up for DQ, as they feel like they have less of an impact in the DQ pre-made environment. In SQ, I could carry with solid Alistar plays and shotcalling. I've found this to be much less the case in DQ, as my jng/top/mid pre-made does all the shot-calling while their 3-man premade camps bot. It's a difficult environment for an already weak roll.\n\n'Queue times matching Team Builder times is because Riot utterly failed with the Fill position and Support Secondary.'\n\nHow can you be so confident making such a statement? Lobster broke it down in the video quite plainly. Queue times are the result of pre-made system, elo matching, and role selection. If the support/fill issue falls under role selection, that's still only 1/3rd of the pie. Even then, TB used to have a more specific role selection feature and the queue times were about the same. I mentioned this in my op. Thus, the logical conclusion is that the queue times are either the results of less players or the pre-made feature.\n\nI'm not making the correlation between the opinions you've provided and the belief that a SQ would have longer queue times. It doesn't seem possible, given that SQ would remove one of the attempt layers.","replies":[{"poster":"Saidai","date":"2016-06-03T03:05:39.068+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"holysht, see this is why I read posts, that is so true, support already has the most fragile role for many reasons. They don't have the hyper carry potential to carry games solo, the only thing they can do is throw out cc and make watch map and help give call shots and such. They cant do that in a dynamic queue that has 3 people who are not gonna listen to them because \"the other 2 people are scrubs if they don't go 20-3 kd\" like.....  if u look at a good amount of the shotcallers in league, theyre junglers and supports, why? because these two are less focused on farming and more on helping  the team get ahead, warding, keeping map presence things like that. So when a support's voice cant be heard, what is their purpose? what can they do? They cant 1v1 anyone on the other team typically, and have u ever seen a support v support fight? its like a tank v tank fight, and those rarely happen to the point where someone gets to kill/outplay the other because supports fight with their mates. As the guy above said, supports in the old solo queue could see their leadership skills grow and such because they could make calls, and with them being able to see the whole map and seeing whats doable and what not, in a dynamic queue, they don't have that luxury because of the environment, and we all know when ur grouped with ur friends and ur on voice chat, you're barely payin attention to the ingame chat because why? u already know ur friends are gonna come gank ur lane, ur gonna make ur 3 man plans to gank whatever, and the rest of team is pretty much ignored.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2016-06-01T15:39:06.963+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> 'Queue times matching Team Builder times is because Riot utterly failed with the Fill position and Support Secondary.'\n> \n> How can you be so confident making such a statement?

The only change that they're rolling out to *everyone* is Autofill, aka \"you will get Support regardless of if you picked it.\" \n\n> 'In a premade, you've got players that want to duo bot'.\n> \n> Sure, but not all the time.

I use to go Mid/Support all the time, and last year I got Mid 63% of the time in Ranked. According to Riot, if I tried that now with roles declared before the lobby I'd get Mid 16% of the time.

Can't back that up without repeating myself.\n\n> Out of curiosity, how long were you two a Support main and when did you leave it?\n\nHmm. Typing as I think. Was a mid main for most of season 2. Season 3 I started filling all roles, but enjoyed supporting in ranked due to how terrible most supports were. I probably filled my way through rank up to gold 4ish, meaning support ~60% of the time. I stopped filling and started calling \"top/jng pref\" probably season 4. If you browse through my Lolking ranked stats, you'll see that I've always played a wide variety of roles, though.\n\n\n> You never had a SQ to make that determination, you had Solo/Duo Queue. It wasn't uncommon to hear people say \"bot with so-and-so\" in that queue, and that's just the people who pointed out that they were with someone.\n\n\nContinuing with the anecdotal experience, and perhaps this is coming from a negativity bias on my behalf, I can recall a large number of games where bot wasn't getting along in old SQ. \"Support doesn't ward.\" \"This adc just suicides, I'm roaming top.\" \"Report this raka, taking cs.\" Etc.\n\n> Going back to my first point, many people wouldn't mind going Support once in a while if their main was taken.\n\nI agree with this completely. I do clearly see that the support/fill options are flawed atm, and I think Riot has alot of work to do in that department regardless of whether we're talking about SQ or DQ. But I do not see this as being responsible for queue times, given my experience with TB in the past. This brings me back to my point in the OP. If we remove TB and turn SQ into TB SQ, then the population increase should be exponential, as we hopefully bring both crowds into one queue. If we then give TB two role selections instead of one, this should expedite the matchmaking process even further. Why hasn't this formula worked, then? It's logical to assume this must either be because of a decrease in players, or it's the pre-made system.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Avarosa Guide Me","date":"2016-06-02T01:54:15.828+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=DrCyanide,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=2ZQvdUqe,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2016-06-01T14:29:36.881+0000)\n>\n> A pure Solo Queue would likely have **longer** queue times than Dynamic Queue. \n> \n\n#SupportLife","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lettow","date":"2016-06-01T13:03:57.831+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for taking the time to write such a thoughtful post!","replies":[{"poster":"Aheadatime","date":"2016-06-01T13:47:52.389+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Np.

I do feel like role selection should be expanded to three choices rather than two, though. \n\nA pure SQ would solve the issues of queue time, fair matches, accurate elo representation, and personal impact. It's also the most logical manifestation of competition available, as every single game you bring precisely 20% of the team's worth to the table and are judged accordingly. Inversely, it's possible to get matched with a 3 or 4-man group and have that 20% diminish significantly.\n\nMy opinion is that there should be a pure SQ with current champ select and three role positions alongside a 5-man ranked queue for teams who wish to compete their way to the LCS (or just have fun climbing as high as they can).","replies":[{"poster":"Saidai","date":"2016-06-03T03:14:57.074+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"as u said in the post dude, it may not solve the problems, because part of the problem  itself remains in the fact that a lot of people don't want to pick support secondary if they know theyre gonna get it like 100 of out 101 times. Even if theyre a good support. Role selection is what causes most of the problems for matching. Its frustrating seeing these 2:40 min estimated times. in the old solo q it was like 1:30 estimated at worst even at like peek  hours for lower ranks (silver gold bronze plat). Role selection and grouped queues are the problem in the new dynamic queue, if I had to get rid of one though, it would be grouped. because that is just bs, and I also don't like how role selection is cuz of how stupid it is and unbalanced.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Kudrov","date":"2016-06-01T18:30:44.469+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"In the Video, Lobbster, the main dev for DynamicQ said : \"we never had that much peoples playing ranked right now\" to trying to tell us there never been that much players playing since DynamicQ come out like it was a great thing. \n\n well no shit sherlock whats left? \n\nSoloQ GONE, Ranked's 5 GONE, TwistedTreeline ranked GONE, TeamBuilder GONE, Dominon GONE. \n\nis it me or the next STEP is League of Legend GONE.","replies":[{"poster":"Saidai","date":"2016-06-03T03:29:16.587+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really am upset with what riot did. Dynamic queue was so unnecessary. Idk what complainers told them to make such a crappy mode. Probably some shttyass players who could never win a game without being carried by a diamond friend. I had fun playing 5v5s with my friends in 5v5 ranked, it was so cool making our own team names and such. Now we have nothing left. Just this bumass mode where it doesn't even feel fun. When I curbstomp people with my friends in ranked these days, its not fun, when I get curbstomped by grouped people, its not fun. Its just sad that riot is doing this for no good reason. If they care so much about the low amount of ragers who specifically like 'dynamic queue' so they can have a rank that's supposed to represent individual skill,( but in reality it doesn't anymore cuz that was solo queue, this is dynamic queue), then they probably don't care about the majority of committed players who truly love the game because that group of people who love dynamic queue so much don't deserve to play ranked because the rank theyre gaining is a fake representation. \"Oh im plat 3 from bronze 1\" \"Howd u get there?\" \"I played 5 man with my 4 buddies, we never lost a game, we're so good\" then look at a solo player who keeps getting sht on by groups like his \" I played like 500 ranked games and only went to gold 4 from bronze 1\" its not fair. A solo player in Dynamic queue cant have as huge of an impact. Theres a reason streamers made posts saying which champs are good for solo q, and when they say which champs are good for solo q, u often hear them say, \"but bad for LCS\". Dynamic queue is trying to mimic LCS or some sht, but in reality u cant do that and have solo players who have solo ranks. ranked 5v5s was more of the LCS kinda experience where teams could plan and such for those games. Dynamic queue does nothing but degrade a solo q player.\n\nand Tbh lower elo players complain mostly about the queue times, sure some complain about getting curbstomped, but find a lvl 30 account, q up for a ranked game, ask every person in the game, how they feel, do it, they will tell u the times are sht, I add people all the time, everyone has the same cry, q times long af. I will say atleast 9 out of 10 of my friends havfe this cry.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"rtbf225618241","date":"2016-06-01T12:36:34.795+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":7,"body":">  Many of your players are intelligent people; \n\nNot on the Boards.
