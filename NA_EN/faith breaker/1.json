He also does not use any of his VO's for interacting with BAZZA or DAZZA. In a few cases he uses the visual animation for his Tiger Stance Taunt, no matter which stance he is in. I began to notice they bugs around the patch or two before Rek'Sai was announced.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-02-14T03:08:47.852+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the report!

When the game starts at 0:00 Udyr has a voice over line he's supposed to say. The wiki has 3 lines listed. I don't know if they are random or map-specific, but the issue is that he doesn't say anything at all. 25% of the time (on rift) he will say line number 1. 75% of the time he will say nothing.\n\n1) \"Hear me, spirits, and rise to my call.\"\n2) \"The energy of creation is our strength.\"\n3) \"From the four corners ancient guardians wake.\"\n\nEDIT: Also, I assume \"BAZZA AND DAZZA\" that the OP is talking about is baron and dragon? Where did those words even come from?","replies":[{"poster":"Faith Breaker","date":"2015-02-18T12:05:34.482+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's what they were called during URF I believe.

Currently I can only 100% activate this in Tiger Stance. I twice got the Turtle spirit to animate and dance with him in Turtle stance but can't reproduce those circumstances. Have not been able to recreate the Tiger animation glitch ( while in other stances) I read on the patch notes Braum's El Tigre skin recently had an audio fix. And I have noticed audio bugs regarding sion as well. Has anyone else reported any Sion issues with audio? If not I can make a seperate thread and report the bugs involving Sion.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
