Maybe add text at the bottom of the \"setting\" near \"done\" that say something along the lines of \"you may need to change pc setting\" or w/e. \n\nHad to go into my normal change wallpaper and put it on shuffle and slide show. Than in the setting make it so a screen saver is active since its automatically disabled. Than pick pictures and apply then reload and active league displays.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kokua","date":"2017-12-10T22:09:09.435+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your personal settings might need to be changed outside of League displays too.","replies":[]}]}
