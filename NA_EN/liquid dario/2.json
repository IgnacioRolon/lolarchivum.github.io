Also Question about Emotes for a riot member.","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are all the emotes gone in the store ? I see none at all now. I really wanted to get the SKT emote today logged on to see nothing now -.- I havent been around for a while and am really dissapointed if I missed the opportunity to get it -.- by a SINGLE Day as I had seen them in the store yesterday and had no idea they wouldnt be there not even 24 hours later. \r\n\r\nAlso why arent they in the store permanently ? why are they only temporary I am sure that players would like to support their favorite teams all year long. Why only do this for worlds and then take them all away and make people who may not have had the funds at the time or had other issues not be able to support ? why does it like hurt riot or something to have them stay ? \r\n\r\nAny chance you could bring them back with the BE store or something so that people who missed out could have a chance to get them -.- I am extremely sad that I couldnt get one in less than 24 hours. I had no idea they were going away there was no warning or anything I just came back ..... {{sticker:sg-soraka}}","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-06T22:30:19.258+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The Worlds team emotes and icons were only around during Worlds =\\ . They did stick around a day or so, but they left the store officially once Worlds was over. I don't believe they'll be in the BE store, but we'll have to see once it's opened!","replies":[]}]}
