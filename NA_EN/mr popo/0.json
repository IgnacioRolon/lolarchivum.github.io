While I loved the previous instant stun cage, it was not the most healthy move in the game. And the tradeoffs Veigar received for nerfing it were actually quite nice, especially the significantly inceased range and extra farming on Q. His average win rate is stable and healthy, and I feel very effective playing him at a Diamond level. With that said, I think that his overall design can be made a lot better with some small changes. To sum up my complaints in one sentence:\r\n\r\n**Veigar is too good against some champions and too weak against others.**\r\n\r\nAgainst assassins and those with high mobility or burst, Veigar suffers. The increased safety on Q farming does not make up for the increased delay on E. Matchups against people like Katarina, Annie, and Talon are hell for him, and a lot of gank-heavy junglers can destroy him even if he plays the laning phase safe.\r\n\r\nOn the other side of the coin, Veigar is simply too good against a lot less aggro AP champions, like Azir, Ziggs, and Cassiopeia, and it&#039;s mostly because of his ult. They can&#039;t bully him out of lane nearly as well, and they need to build AP to do their job well, so Veigar&#039;s ult ends up removing them from the game. Even high-mobility-high-burst champions like Leblanc suffer from this due to building mostly glass cannon. Considering it&#039;s a point-and-click, that&#039;s not quite fun or fair for either side.\r\n\r\nSo, to even out these matches and create a healthier environment for both Veigar and his opponents, I propose these changes:\r\n\r\n1. **Reduce the delay on Event Horizon from .5 to .4**\r\nA delay is necessary on Veigar&#039;s E - the insta-stun simply wasn&#039;t a fair mechanic for his opponents. However, the current gate just leaves him slightly too vulnerable against the aforementioned assassin/bursty types. I think reducing it to .4 would be make landing the E a good balance between Veigar&#039;s skill and his opponent&#039;s skill, whereas now it&#039;s tilted too far towards being based on his opponent&#039;s skill.\r\n\r\n2. **Reduce the Enemy AP ratio on his ult from .8 to .5**\r\nThere&#039;s no reason for a point-and-click burst move to have an additional .8 Enemy AP ratio tacked onto it. That&#039;s simply far too powerful against anyone that likes to build AP.\r\n\r\n3. **Increase the Self AP ratio on his ult from 1.0 to 1.1**\r\nThis is to make Veigar a little better against AD mid opponents, who are quite common these days, and to slightly even out the power drop he&#039;ll get against enemy AP opponents from the nerf suggested in step 2.\r\n\r\n\r\nI think those three changes together will allow Veigar to deal with mobility/assassin/bursty types if he&#039;s skilled enough (while leaving them as an overall weak matchup for him), while also not making Veigar such an oppressive matchup against certain AP changes.

My suspicion is that perhaps a large portion of Veigar players play him just to watch their ult literally 1-shot the enemy AP mid.\n\nThis thread might be relevant:\n\n* **[New Veigar makes me so sad](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/RorHOOY3-new-veigar-makes-me-so-sad)**\n\nI do like the idea of Veigar being a Champion with a rough lanephase who, if he plays his evil cards right, gets to take gleeful vengeance upon his lanephase oppressor in the later phases of the match. But I don't think that aspect of him is in major need of either reinforcement or modification.\n\n>  I wish there was some more way to optimize use of the spell that wasn't just click on a guy when they get in range\n\nI mean, I don't think you need to be worrying about that too much. There's an entire class of Champions whose role in the match is to right-click on people when they get in range. I see Veigar as being more about positioning and strategizing than landing tons of skillshots with mad LCS reflexes. And it concerns me that sometimes Riot seems to treat mechanical skill and reflexes as the only legitimate forms of skill, or at least the most legitimate.\n\nThe heart of the problem with new Veigar is his stun.\n\n# Yes, his old stun was kind of stupid\nNo, I didn't really like the old stun. I thought it was stupid to have a \"cage\" ability that functioned as some sort of weird circle-shaped (for lack of a better word) \"skillshot\". That was always lame: unfun for people who got insta-stunned, unfun for Veigar Summoners who lived or died based on how precisely they could line up the translucent circle with the enemy from a tilted perspective.\n\nBut as lame as the old stun was, it did tie his kit together. It was an ability with two major uses: locking down an enemy squishy for a mega-burst rotation, and stunning several lower-value enemy targets to help your team in a teamfight. It created some choices.\n\n# The new stun is somehow worse\nThe new stunâ€¦is a \"stun\" that only actually stuns people if the batteries on their mouse run out, or if they get distracted by a squirrel out their window and are thereby prevented from clicking in literally any direction after the **[obnoxious warning lights](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/kMxmMEAE-veigar-tries-to-get-riot-to-make-him-a-new-event-horizon)** start flashing.\n\nTo me, new Veigar's gameplay feels terribly flat. There's no high-stakes kill-or-be-killed cat-and-mouse feeling. It's just like, \"Okay. Throw my stun somewhere in the general vicinity of the enemy team. Lob some skillshots at people. Cool. I did some damage.\"\n\nVeigar's stun needs **something** more interesting. Some new mechanic. I don't know. Something that can synergize with his other abilities to let him throw a full rotation if he does it right/the enemy does it wrong. Maybe landing a Q on an enemy inside the cage stuns them?\n\n# A remake informed by caricatures?\nBluntly, I feel like Veigar was remade by people who'd never really played Veigar. A lot of his new aspects seem like they have origins in popular caricatures of Veigar: \"Veigar's a Champion who farms Q all game and if he farms his Q tons then he can like push a button and DELETE you.\" That's certainly not how I would have described him.\n\n# Context that makes (made) R interesting\nTaking a step back: the old kit made R interesting in that you had to decide if you were, e.g., going to gamble on splitting R and DFG to maybe burst two targets, at the risk of getting none. Or if you were going to go all-in with a full EWQR rotation, or if you were going to use your E to stun a few low-value targets and help your team, while trusting on Q+R alone to burst a weakened (or glass cannon) enemy. And, of course, there was the positioning dance: if you get too close, the enemy team will pounce on you and eat you for lunch, but if you can catch their carry out of position without a defensive line, you can delete them with (seeming) ease.\n\nThat's what I miss. I don't even really care about power level: nobody who was playing Old Veigar was doing it for the mad MMR gainz, after all. I just kind of want some interesting gameplay back.\n\n# Burst or poke?\nTo address your question more directly: I don't like Veigar as a \"poke mage\". He's supposed to be the archetypal burst mage. Old Veigar, for all his flaws, did accomplish that: he had a gameplay style centered around burst. New Veigar is some kind of weird poke mage with a trivially simplistic \"push R to deal tons of damage\" burst ult.\n\nNot trying to be melodramatic, but this post wouldn't be complete without adding that, despite having played thousands upon thousands of Veigar matches before the rework, I really dislike playing him now. Every now and then, I'll try a Veigar match. But it just feels so very flat. If I 100-0 someone, it feels like it happened because they're Wood Tier and walked into a stun wall for no reason. More often, he just plays like a generic mage now: poke some, do some damage with spells, die. It seems much harder to screw up, and much harder to do something remarkable. He has more raw power, but not much flexibility or nuance.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=RiotRepertoir,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Nbvshjbu,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2015-08-12T02:32:14.353+0000)\n>\n> My suspicion is that perhaps a large portion of Veigar players play him just to watch their ult literally 1-shot the enemy AP mid.\n\nWhile I really appreciate you soliciting Veigar feedback, this remark kind of leads me to think that you're a bit off in your estimation of what people like(d) about Veigar. Pushing R and insta-bursting an enemy is something that happens when you're stupidly fed and the match should have been over 20 minutes ago. That's not core to the Veigar gameplay experience.\n\nIt might be more accurate to say that one cool thing about Veigar was that, if you did everything just right, you could make it *seem* as though you were utterly overpowered and invincible, when in reality you know that if X Y Z hadn't each fallen into place, you'd have been blown to pieces before landing a single spell. He's a little fluffball trying to be a scary dark mage: in the same way, he was always a very weak Champion who had some ability to psych out his opponents.","replies":[{"poster":"Wheatloaf","date":"2015-08-12T15:24:28.849+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What if the delay indicator on his E didn't show the exact location of the walls...?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2015-08-12T06:02:20.631+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't feel like the extra 0.1 ratio against everyone would be noticeable enough to make me want to swap it. Right now, if there's a runaway Katarina on the other team, my only hope to do anything is if I can click on her with my Ultimate the nanosecond before I'm instantly deleted and hope that she's fed enough to instantly die from my Ultimate. \n\nThe 0.1 second speed up of Event Horizon doesn't seem super useful either. Honestly, what would be more useful is if once you started the spell it didn't disappear if you died before it finished setting up. Yes, I die, but if I've stunned or caged an enemy for my team to follow up it might be OK.\n\nI definitely play Veigar to delete enemy carries, with my fallback pattern being CC bot for the team. Those are really the only two modes Veigar has, phasers set for stun or set to kill. Your Q range is a little too short to poke at a safe distance when multiple enemies are there, and poking with your W... if they're not stunned or minion blocked, forget it. \n\nMaybe a faster W fall time would be an OK idea? I mean, Cho'gath's Rupture has a larger area, faster cast time, hard CC, soft CC, and the same AP ratio. Compared to that, is it really so crazy to shave 0.2 seconds off the fall time? It would make poking with W feel a little less futile, admittedly with the trade off that it takes less points in E to guarantee a W will hit.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Curling Veigar","date":"2015-08-12T02:56:11.195+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RiotRepertoir,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Nbvshjbu,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2015-08-12T02:32:14.353+0000)\n>\n> So.. that E change is a direct buff, and .1 seconds off a delay can actually be the difference between a spell feeling undodgeable and unusable, as funny as it sounds.\n> \n> The R changes seem like they may be a step in the right direction.

My suspicion is that perhaps a large portion of Veigar players play him just to watch their ult literally 1-shot the enemy AP mid.\n\nI'll chime in, as I played this champion to diamond and continue maining him up here so I'd say im somewhat credible.\n\n\nAnyways, what I and a lot of other veigar players would like is you could  remove the enemy AP scaling altogether and just increase his own ratio on his ult to be like 1.4-1.5 or something so it isn't overkill against mages but also better vs everyone overall. Perhaps you can increase its mana cost/cooldown as well a little bit.\n\nRight now most of his power budget is in his W which outdamages his ult by only 180 damage if say they an enemy has an AD mid laner. This being said with the extra AP gained from his Q I'm having a lot of instances where my Q+W combo leaves an enemy about two auto attacks worth of HP left from full HP-- and I'm thinking, why would I want to ult someone *that* low on HP? Often times my Q+W ought right kills a squishy on its own and my ult flies in the air and hits nothing because the person I targeted already died and I wasted it. This being said, the increased AP ratio on ult (but removed enemy AP scaling) could help with dealing with carries that are hard to catch, like, say a Vayne with a QSS. She's not going to get hit by my W ever.\n\nThe change I mentioned earlier is what I'd like to see because it'd make him more overall reliable without being overkill versus certain guys.\n\nAnd as for the stun change, I don't particularly care about it as later on I don't need it to gib people because I can just Q+R any squishy and they'll die instantly. But I'm not too sure if riot would be willing to take away his \"antimage\" identity, would you?","replies":[{"poster":"junglerboy16","date":"2015-08-12T18:19:29.564+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok, not really a veigar player, but what I always heard as the explanation for his R's enemy AP ratio was that it was a way to keep him from falling too far behind, but also a gate against Veigar if his opponent was far behind. If Veigar was behind, it supposedly allowed him more reliability to burst the enemy APC. If Veigar was ahead, instead of having a 3k damage ult on demand whenever he wanted, he was limited by how strong his opponent was and how much AP they had.\n\nThat could be really outdated of course, but it definitely makes sense. I can see them adjusting the base scaling and enemy scaling a bit (say 60% enemy AP 120% own AP) but flat out removing that mechanic while still giving him comparable damage from it would seem to leave him much more vulnerable to falling behind while also being much more oppressive if ahead. It basically seems like he would become even more snowbally than most late game hyper scaling champs.\n\nAgain, I'm just talking from general game knowledge, not a lot of direct Veigar experience, so please correct me if I'm wrong about this.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Spicy Rice","date":"2015-08-12T04:16:59.144+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How do you play him at diamond?

Obviously it comes from the atmosphere around him so why not add a little shield based on his missing mana too after all gathering all that mana together should disrupt a bit the surrounding reality right? \n\nso my idea would be that based on the more mana he gathers from his surrounding(the less mana he has) he gets a shield this shield only blocks ad dmg this shield should be have a rather high base but low growth, im not sure about the numbers tough i would leave those to experienced rioters.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LaceUp23","date":"2015-08-12T15:31:13.975+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would like to see his W changed :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sire Hippington","date":"2015-08-12T15:27:15.778+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd really apreichiate a turn away from anticaster towards master of evil.

It required **your** skill. However this stun was [worth more than an entire support](http://euw.lolesports.com/articles/stop-laughing-lemonnations-support-veigar), and recieved necessary changes.\n However, the real problem with the new Veigar is that he relies too much on his **opponent's mistakes** (_walking into the stun, staying with low life in lane when I'm about to hit six, junglers underestimating the burst, ..._), instead of relying on the **skill of the Veigar player**.\n If the Event Horizon warning appears, an experienced enemy can either walk out of it before it even appeared or stay inside. That allows the enemy to avoid Veigar's burst (_you can dodge Veigar's W inside the Event Horizon without getting stunned!_).\n\nA few proposals to give Veigar his identity as something scary back:\n1. **Put a Singularity inside his Event Horizon**\nInside every event horizon is a singularity with an immense gravitation. The whole thing is also called black hole. This gravitational force could be reflected by slowing every enemy inside his E. The slow could decay over time to enable some counterplay. But it would allow Veigar to have a chance to land his W, if used properly (with **skill**).\nAn even more radical, but fun change, would be [this](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/PskFer6M-as-his-e-veigar-should-create-a-fucking-black-hole). Slightly overpowered.\n2. **Speed Boost**\nBy giving Veigar an Righteous Glory like speed boost, Veigar would be in a better position to place his E properly, using **skill**. The speed boost effect could be something that procs after accumulating 100 stacks (I know you love stacks riot). Why stacks? It enables counter play in the time frame in which Veigar is vulnerable. Maybe even nerf him while not having 100 stacks, if the speed boost is too OP.\n\nTo conclude, these changes serve the sole purpose to give Veigar some **skill reliant power** instead of the **opponent's-mistakes-power**.\nThank you for reading! {{summoner:31}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rundus1","date":"2015-08-12T04:42:10.293+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RiotRepertoir,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Nbvshjbu,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2015-08-12T02:32:14.353+0000)\n>\n> So.. that E change is a direct buff, and .1 seconds off a delay can actually be the difference between a spell feeling undodgeable and unusable, as funny as it sounds.\n> \n> The R changes seem like they may be a step in the right direction.
