It was completely out of my control there was absolutely nothing I could do to prevent this, the game did not detect and issue with the client when I opened it so why am I being punished for league being at fault?\r\n\r\nLeaver buster warning right after the game is complete: https://gyazo.com/1e9b6c0105250b06e89761da58b17899\r\n\r\nI wan't to know why I was given this leaver buster and if there is any way I can get it revoked because this is not my fault at all.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-20T03:00:07.413+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Game crashes that cause the client to repatch are pretty hard to catch prior to the game starting. They crash like that because they finally pull on a file that ends up being corrupted or missing, which then causes the crash. The client realizes that the crash happened due to missing/damaged files, so it starts a repatch. \n\nYou ended up with the LPQ because you were out of the match for long enough to have it affect the overall game most likely, regardless of whether you made it back in or not.","replies":[]}]}
