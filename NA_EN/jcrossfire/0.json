Also, playing on Mac, which I know now it's not meant for gaming, I'm seeing that I have just been having way too many problems with being able to game. So, question for any of you who know all about building computers and what not. What would be the best idea gaming computer to have? I have no clue. If price range is concerned.... I'd be wiling to pay around $2,000 total. If I can go cheaper for what you can get for great quality then that's perfect! please would any of you guys point me in the right direction? Thank you!","replies":[{"poster":"DingleNutsMcGee","date":"2016-01-17T00:49:02.640+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You dont even need to spend 2,000$. I just built a beeeeeeautiful gaming pc for about 1,200$-1,300$! i have an Nvidia 980ti graphics card, but to be honest if you got a 970 youd be able to run just about any game on ultra settings. Building one is always better than buying. Saves assloads of money to have someone build it for you. And it only takes a couple days. Plus you can customize it anyway you like for your own personal experience","replies":[{"poster":"JCrossfire","date":"2016-01-19T17:56:32.046+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"woah nice.

My ideal gaming pc would be one that I would be able to play my game (wether it be League or WoW) and be able to also run Twitch or something else. I'm guessing that's what the RAM is for? not sure, So, to be able to run multiple programs at once without crashing, lagging, taking so long. Almost like how the people who stream can do. They game (play LoL) while streaming and while playing WoW while they are in que for rank. I would love to play LoL or WoW and also be able to watch Twitch or be on skype as well. That might also need 2 monitors? im not sure.","replies":[]}]}]}
