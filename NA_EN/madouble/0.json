I've got your ticket pulled up, and I went ahead and looked into that transferred account and it doesn't looked like the account is stuck transferring actually. The transfer has completed and the account is on EUN now, but you had to change the username and summoner name when you transferred. \n\nIt seems like the main issue might be that you're using the wrong username on EUW, which was what the agent in your ticket said, so double check that username and use the [**Forgot Username**](https://account.leagueoflegends.com/eune/en/forgot-username) page if you can't remember.\n\nAlso, spamming the boards and other users posts isn't necessarily a good way to get our attention or a response faster. More often than not, it only prevents other people from getting help.","replies":[{"poster":"madouble","date":"2017-06-08T21:47:28.558+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i didnt changed the name though, it just told me to restart the client","replies":[{"poster":"madouble","date":"2017-06-08T21:58:36.279+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=madouble,realm=EUNE,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=qAfpA0jq,comment-id=0007000000000000,timestamp=2017-06-08T21:47:28.558+0000)\n>\n>\n i didnt changed the name though, it just told me to restart the client\n\nok i managed to get in, for some reason the username changed without notifying me and now i have a different summoner name","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"madouble","date":"2017-06-08T19:18:32.988+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"just the delete the account and refund me the money.\nit was a mistake spending my money on a company that treat me like garbage.","replies":[]},{"poster":"madouble","date":"2017-06-08T19:10:51.999+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"again, bump","replies":[]},{"poster":"madouble","date":"2017-06-08T16:24:58.580+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"im gonna bump everyhour","replies":[]},{"poster":"madouble","date":"2017-06-08T15:28:00.413+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bump","replies":[]},{"poster":"madouble","date":"2017-06-08T12:39:17.992+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i am unable to view my ticket since it requires an account for some reason.","replies":[]},{"poster":"madouble","date":"2017-06-08T19:12:36.524+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"riot is answering newer thread than mine.\nfeelsbadman{{item:3070}}","replies":[]}]}
