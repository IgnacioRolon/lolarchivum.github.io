It's your game so it's your choice. However, I do have a issue with the current pricing model. A lot of recent skins that have been priced at 1350 RP don't have any business being that expensive. Furthermore, a lot of older (poorer quality) skins should have been discounted but are still sitting at unreasonable prices. There isn't any reason for a skin like Warring Kingdoms Xin Zhao to still be 1350 RP. You should probably decide on a more reasonable pricing model for older skins that have depreciated in value before you continue working on ideas for future skins. Just my feedback.","replies":[{"poster":"CyberArtillery","date":"2017-07-02T22:39:27.872+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"$10 for older skins of good quality is fine, remember Riot updated all Miss Fortune skins for example.
