They seem to add extra graphics in these new legendary skins I hope they make one for Jhin someday. \r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b2fdeaeX40","replies":[{"poster":"AmazoX","date":"2017-06-30T13:46:12.409+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"You should check out Aurelion Sol's login music, You will feel power overflowing.","replies":[{"poster":"Stalinium","date":"2017-06-30T16:09:08.668+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"This^\n\nTons of the logins are great.
