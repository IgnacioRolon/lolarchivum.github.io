The health bar finally scales, but the level you are doesn't, and neither does the \"notches\" in your health bar. Now sure yeah us 4k users could scale down to 1080p, but I hope everyone here realizes that scaling down to 1080p on a 4k monitor looks entirely like shit. I feel like I'm using a VHS. All we want is the scaling on the hud. The graphics are PERFECT! I fell in love with the detail immediately, but the scaling of the health bars and what not is not a hard task for such a huge company to adjust. I have no doubt they could do it in less the a week honestly. But all in all, only reason I'm commenting is because you said to scale back down to 1080p, Fuck that. I didn't spend nearly $1000's worth on skins for riot not to do one small little patch to progress into the 4k future. More and more people are going to 4k and I hope all riot members realize that.

I put hundreds of dollars into the game and can't even play.  Super upsetting.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CyberArtillery","date":"2017-07-09T01:04:45.151+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Porocles,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=0AB39R0W,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2017-07-08T21:51:50.847+0000)\n>\n> 4K isn&#x27;t fully supported right now, so you can run into issues.

But the UI scaling is so bad, in DOTA 2 they released a patch to support 4K resolution, most games I know off even ones from small indie companies offer support for 4K Resolution.\n\nI cannot understand how it is that Riot a 3 billion dollar company the biggest game developer in the world has yet to release 4K support. \n\nDo you have an ETA on when you guys can roll out a 4K patch? \n\nWill we have official 4K Textures aswell? meaning like are you guys planning on re texturing the map etc with new 4K textures to take advantage of modern monitors? 4K is becoming the new standard, and LoL just doesn't seem to be keeping up with the modern era which makes me sad because even basic modern graphic technology is not supported in LoL the Engine is just soo old now and everybody has a modern PC these days :(","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CyberArtillery","date":"2017-07-08T18:05:56.056+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I also think the champions look smaller aswell the scaling is not good guys please don't tell me I wasted $450 USD on this monitor I bought it just for league please guys how do I fix this :(","replies":[{"poster":"Khelb","date":"2017-07-08T18:20:20.337+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey man, no 4k for me, but a quick google search resulted this:  https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report/n9Fsfxwp-fix-for-scaling-problems-high-resolution-monitors-hidpi-2k-4k-displays-fix\n\nif that doesn't do anything for ya let me know and i can keep looking for more potential fixes.","replies":[{"poster":"CyberArtillery","date":"2017-07-08T18:46:18.426+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Khelb,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=0AB39R0W,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2017-07-08T18:20:20.337+0000)\n>\n> Hey man, no 4k for me, but a quick google search resulted this:  https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report/n9Fsfxwp-fix-for-scaling-problems-high-resolution-monitors-hidpi-2k-4k-displays-fix\n> \n> if that doesn&#x27;t do anything for ya let me know and i can keep looking for more potential fixes.\n\nHi this does not work because the UI minion health bars and mini map etc are all the same tiny size no matter what I do.\n\nIts alright I am going to have to wait for Riot to send out a patch for this, i assume they are working on one? this issue should have been fixed along time ago because games like DOTA 2 doesn't have this problem and riot is a 3 billion dollar company with just 1 game.","replies":[{"poster":"Khelb","date":"2017-07-08T18:49:22.759+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"gotcha,  Are you able to change the resolution while in game?
