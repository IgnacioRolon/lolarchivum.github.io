I sent a ticket to Riot Support regarding my account being hacked and it's been 2 days and no response. When I try to check the status of my ticket by clicking the number sent in the initial email I just get taken to the main Riot Support screen with no ticket. Any idea how to check it? I wasn't logged in when I sent in and I'm sure you can't even be logged in to send one regarding account hacks.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-09T23:27:13.974+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you submitted a ticket via email, you can't check on your ticket on the support site. Reply times can really depend on how many tickets that team has in their queue, so I recommend continuing to be patient while someone gets back to you as soon as they can. Avoid replying to or \"bumping\" you ticket, as it sends your ticket to the back of the queue and lengthens the time it takes to get a reply.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}
