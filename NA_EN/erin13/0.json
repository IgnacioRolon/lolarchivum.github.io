(unless your like 4/5 and even then ...). So he isn't really the most un healthy champ, I still think he is below average though.","replies":[{"poster":"MunchCrunchLunch","date":"2016-04-14T01:35:44.608+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"no hes not. hes a stat check spam your abilities champion. hes not hard to play at all.","replies":[{"poster":"CrazFight ","date":"2016-04-14T02:01:38.124+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MunchCrunchLunch,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=lEJGEp3m,comment-id=0003000000000000,timestamp=2016-04-14T01:35:44.608+0000)\n>\n> no hes not. hes a stat check spam your abilities champion. hes not hard to play at all.\n\nMaybe in lower elo, but as your get higher this is def not the case.","replies":[{"poster":"MunchCrunchLunch","date":"2016-04-14T02:03:15.675+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"what makes kassadin hard to play in any way in any elo? the fact hes so bad you have to be a god at him to do anything with him?","replies":[{"poster":"CrazFight ","date":"2016-04-14T02:17:31.540+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MunchCrunchLunch,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=lEJGEp3m,comment-id=000300000000000000000000,timestamp=2016-04-14T02:03:15.675+0000)\n>\n> what makes kassadin hard to play in any way in any elo? the fact hes so bad you have to be a god at him to do anything with him?\n\nYou can really punish kass early game, which not all low elo will do, but higher elo's will make sure to play around kass and not allow him to jump on squish's and spam abilities on them. Also higher elo has better positioning so they will most likely not put themselves in the position to allow kass to spam stabilizes on them.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"muirn","date":"2016-04-15T00:31:35.527+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the biggest problem with Kass right now isn't whether or not he's balanced, it's just that he doesn't feel distinct anymore. There was a time when Kass was **the** mobility champion, but now, even if he's relatively balanced, practically every other assassin has the same degree of mobility as he does and a fair number outpace him in damage as well. Then for a while, he was billed as **the** anti-mage assassin, but except for the gimmicky magic shield on his Q and the stack mechanic on his E, there's nothing to really justify that anymore. Honestly, I don't think he needs a ton of work, and he really should be low priority in any case with all the more relevant stuff that I always hear is being worked on. And I certainly don't want a repeat of S3 when he was an insanely broken monster. But something as small as a few number tweaks could give him back his niche as the most mobile champion in the game who brutally punishes bad decision-making on both sides. I don't know, I just want a reason to feel good about playing Kass again, besides nostalgia and still loving his character. After all, he was my first main way back in S2, he got me hooked on the game and I miss him.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Meep Man","date":"2016-04-14T15:44:15.669+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Which is funny because his kit is still a little meh. Just to keep his R, his Q is really just used as a filler spell whenever you can use it. The shield is too weak to be important and the damage is too low to really be anything huge. It's just used because it can be. His W is a good bit of his kit. It's like the rubberband sticking things together so I think it's needed. His E is a unique concept, but it's still just meh. A damage cone with a slow. It's just as said, kind of meh.\nI would really hope that Kassadin's kit becomes entirely based around being a hyper mobile champion instead of trying to be two things: Anti Mage AND Hyper Mobile","replies":[]},{"poster":"Earl Eulrich","date":"2016-04-14T02:20:05.253+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"you could at least give him the attackspeed on his passive back...he really should be rewarded for taking the risk of a prolonged melee, not so much for bursting from afar or short thunderlord-trades - that´s the pattern that made him unhealthy to begin with.","replies":[{"poster":"Jalkan","date":"2016-04-14T03:10:19.172+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But then he'd have to be built tank.","replies":[{"poster":"Earl Eulrich","date":"2016-04-14T03:12:31.094+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"no? he just would have to use windows of opportunity to go in instead of jumping whereever he pleases whenever he wants.","replies":[{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2016-04-14T14:24:32.484+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's not what your suggestion would achieve.
