Tried everything (Changing settings, updated drivers, that sorta thing) but nothing seemed to change. Then I tried running league as administrator and that seemed to do the trick, so maybe give that a try?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Leyin","date":"2017-12-21T18:41:27.017+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did you played today URF? If yeah that could be a reason for the lags today, a new map with many VFX and many spell casts could cause your performance.","replies":[]}]}
