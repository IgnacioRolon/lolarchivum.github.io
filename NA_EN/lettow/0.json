I wouldn't get match ups like a Bronze 2 vs a Silver 1 like I did recently. The matchups can be incredibly unfair and there's no way to not expect that Silver 1 to carry the whole game. A solo queue would ensure players where matched with members closer to their own division.

And regardless, unless I'm mistaken, most premades gold and below are just groups of friends playing together, with little to no practice. Our only advantage is that we can tell each other if we want to wombo combo or not. Heck even in a solo queue you can type in chat and try create a comp based around a champion\n\nYour point? I'm talking about how toxic League is because of its competitiveness, and how this game actively drives anyone not fully invested away. I had friends last season who just want to play normals and chill but can't cause people in normals can't chill. With DQ I can at least try help my friends just learn how to not tilt and talk them through winning a ranked game so they can at least finish placements.\n\nImplying I have 5 friends available at all times. The ranks are there to show how adaptable you are in a team. Having challenger level mechanics means nothing in a 1v5 situation if your team just runs off.\n\nDid I say that? No, I said premades should and will always have an advantage in a team based game. And to take away from that natural adverting would be denying the game an important aspect of playing it (communicating with your team mates). You can solo the ladder, but in a team game individual skill is only worth so much. \n\n**Solo queue isn't punished. It simply does not have advantages.

Individual skill meaning champion mechanical skill? Because mechanics don't get you very far in League. Knowing how to work around a team you just met (how to adapt to the team) is a much more valuable skill.

It's not competitiveness, it's other people being toxic to each other, and people being unable to truly retaliate leads to brewing resentment and more toxicity. It's not only competitiveness. That is just one of the things. Being a good person is not only rare to see in LoL and other video games, but everywhere on the internet these days. It's a problem we try to prevent, but it doesn't work, and efforts to do so often lead to more toxicity.\n\n3. Individual skill means mechanical skill, willingness to cooperate with complete strangers , consistency in said features, perserverence, etc. Going premade doesn't let you create now bonds and show teamwork with different strangers.

There is no evidence proving that premades troll more than solo players. Quite frankly speaking, the chances of Zed support or a TF ADC (by the way, news flash, TF ADC is viable, just not very meta) in premade groups is just as much as in teams full with solo players.\n\nYou can argue how premades create unfair advantages in comparison to solo players in Dynamic Queue (I actually agree) but stop putting \"trolls\" and \"premades\" together.\n\nEdit: Oh and regarding to your 4th point, Riot has mentioned many times that the system pairs premades of similar size against one another (and fill the rest with solo players of course), and it works at least 95% of the time. The so-called competitive advantage is marginalized based on that. Of course there are some exceptions and that's why it's not 100%.","replies":[{"poster":"Troll for Trump","date":"2016-04-14T04:26:55.849+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not exaggerating.

It would only increase queue times for dynamic queue. Solo queue would have significantly faster queue times. Dynamic queue would really die outside of the 5 man pre-mades (aka the old team ranked system but more than a 9 man per team limit so improvement). The reality of the situation is solo queue would solve the major ranked problems, it would just kill off their ever so precious 2 to 4 man pre-made (especially the 4 man premades) dynamic queues that obviously fails the \"what the players want most\" test.","replies":[{"poster":"Nameless Voice","date":"2016-04-11T22:01:47.716+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"Can you explain the logic behind that?

If solo queue comes out, the vast majority are all going to leave for solo queue. Then dynamic queue will lose all its fill players. So 5 man pre-mades will be in the same position as before, 4 man premades will be by far the slowest at getting a game, and 2 and 3 man premades will pretty much have to wait for other premades of similar sizes to come together with the same general MMR in most cases. So excluding 5v5 matches, dynamic queue is going to slow down considerably. \n\nWhile solo queue may not be faster than the current dynamic queue, there's no logical reason it would be slower. However, a few factors actually might make it faster. Because pre-made are matched up to look for other pre-mades with similar MMR splits, there's a bit more searching involved. Solo players are just going to be jammed together based on their own MMR instead of any special mix up of MMRs. I would at least expect the higher end players currently suffering a 5 minute or so wait to  decrease wait time with solo queue.","replies":[{"poster":"Nameless Voice","date":"2016-04-12T09:15:30.742+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"There are fewer players going into the queue at any given time.\nThere's no way solo queue could fail to be slower.\nIt's simple maths.\n\nLook, put it this way: most people playing support are probably duo with an adc.

When you split the queues, there are suddenly far fewer support players, and so the solo queue will take much longer to find two for each game.\n> The same will apply, too a lesser extent, to all roles.\n\nFirst of all, with the numbers of games going on all the time, in this case fewer players would actually imply quicker queues. Let's say there's 10x as many mids as support. This would mean mids have the longest wait time as they have to wait for support. Now let's say there's 100,000 mids in queue at a time. That would mean there's 10,000 supports in queue at a time. This would imply a 90,000 player wait for mids. Now let's say the queues split and half go to the new queue. So 50,000 mids and 5,000 supports. This is now a 45,000 player wait.\n\nAnd the majority of supports being duo is probly something only stuck in your head cause it's what you do. Pre-mades come in a lot of different forms and duo bots aren't so popular that they screw the probability for what you would expect for a 2 position pre-made combination. Actually, as somebody who played solo support at the beginning of S6 and in prior seasons, I can tell you that dynamic queue is part of the reason a number of people stopped playing support. Getting stuck with adcs from pre-mades is usually very unpleasant. The adc in a pre-made stands the highest chance to be the worst player on the team. And then pre-mades will naturally blame you and back them at every turn.

A 3 man premade is often filled with 2 solo players. If they release a solo queue. The 4 man premade prolly will never get a game, since prolly every solo player will go to solo queue, and the 3 man premade can only start a game if there is a duo to team up with.\n\nThis will make the restrictions for starting a game on the Dynamic queue bigger, so the queue time will go up. This won't apply for the solo queue, since to make a team there you need 5 solo players.
