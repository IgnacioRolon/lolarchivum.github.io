Is this a problem? I know 60fps is good and all and what not, but i'm a fps whore and like to see what my card can max out at, so far it's maxed out at 563 on a good day when it's nice a cold. On my avg hot days it's about 201.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-30T16:42:57.467+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're running Windows 10, this may be a direct result of the Anniversary updates that enabled the Game DVR feature inside the Xbox App. As a quick test, you can [disable the game bar](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html) to see if anything changes.\n\nLet me know the results.","replies":[]},{"poster":"xSenketsu ","date":"2016-08-29T15:24:16.323+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did you ever fix it?
