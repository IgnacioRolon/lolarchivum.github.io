And it's the community's fault.","subforum":"Player Behavior","up_votes":57,"down_votes":29,"body":"This game used to be great. When I first started in season 1, players were helpful and supportive to new players, and it ushered in a nice era of good vibes, good community, and cohesiveness. Sure, people got competitive and maybe said some mean things once in a while, but it wasn't by any means a toxic place to play a game.\n\nNow, the game has completely evolved into a gathering of some of the most awful, rude, disrespectful, racist, homophobic people on the internet. My most recent encounter was one \"[removed by moderation]\", a silver player who claims to have a \"diamond account\". Let me tell you a little about this person and my interaction with him, as I'm sure everyone reading this will have at least something to relate to.\n\nWe start the lane very well, getting our subject \"[removed by moderation]\" (Vayne, our ADC), a first blood kill on a successful invade, and it all snowballs up from there, getting him up to 7/1/1. Then, this person decides to start running into them 2v1, 3v1, and even a 5v1, intentionally killing himself to try to make a big play because \"it's fun, im not trying to win\" (his words). Died every time, and proceeds to claim \"this is a smurf, and this account is going to get banned in a few days anyway\", and proceeds to completely throw the game. Vayne also cheered on the enemy team while flaming and trolling his own. Of course, I reported for intentionally throwing the game.\n\n\n\nBut that's where this thread really starts. Does a simple \"Report for intentionally throwing\" solve the problem? How do I know if action is even taken on this person? Can't this person just make another account to do the same behavior? I feel like action should be taken on this person's main \"diamond account\" (if it even exists), to dissuade this kind of behavior. I personally suggest banning of ranked play for the rest of the season. If people don't respect the game, I feel they shouldn't be entitled to play it.\n\nI guess the point I'm trying to make is Riot needs to start holding these people accountable. I'm not trying to sound like another bellyacher trying to tell Riot what to do to make this game better for my own agenda, but I'm trying to approach this with reason and maybe give the moderators some perspective to chew on, when it comes to planning out how to take action for this general type of player, not necessarily this specific one. \n\nPeople that exhibit this kind of behavior completely devalues your product, Riot. This community has absolutely, without a doubt, have to top the list of the most toxic people. They create these \"smurf\" accounts to ruin your game, to piss off the people trying to enjoy your game, to make money selling an account, or to abuse your lower ranked players (that make up the vast majority of your player base). Poor sportsmanship, trolling/flaming, etc. all break the summoners code, but my question to you is how tight are you even trying to enforce your code anymore? I feel like every game I ever get into is just a stress test that is building up inside me until one day I have a massive heart attack or stroke. \n\nThis game isn't enjoyable anymore. It's been devalued by this community to the point where action needs to be taken. Riot, please, you can't allow this kind of behavior to progress.  Have some class. Have some dignity. Have respect for your players that want to enjoy this game. Or have you created something so big that you can't even handle it anymore? Have you made a game that's grown so much that you don't have control anymore?\n\nOr do you simply not care? Was this whole thing just a waste of time?","replies":[{"poster":"Periscope","date":"2019-05-19T16:52:56.444+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":11,"body":"I've removed the name from your post, as naming and shaming is not allowed on the forums. \n\nIf you have any questions about this moderation action, don't hesitate to reach out to the Boards Moderation Team via:\n\n* The [**NA Boards Discord**](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/community-moderation/7rtKBZLi-boards-moderation-discord-verification)\n* The [**Discuss the Boards**](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/community-moderation) sub-board\n\nYou can submit a [Support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com) or message them on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/RiotSupport) to talk with a Rioter regarding that player if you did not report them in the post game.","replies":[{"poster":"MrGoldDucky666","date":"2019-05-19T21:15:09.809+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":12,"body":"I honestly don't completely agree with this decision, yes we t might cause great and push someone to depression, but public shaming is key to fixing things in my opinion.

They're battling toxicity through chat more than actions though, and that's my only real complaint. Even with that complaint, I have to begrudge the fact that it's harder to detect someone who's soft inting and staying out of chat than it is to detect...hang on... (Disclaimer, none of the following string of absolute filth is my opinion, this is an example...mods, please have mercy...) \"Shouldn't pick Morde, f##king downie noob, uninstall and go back to Brazil.\" or \"kys kid, I don't need to care about 0/4 autistic trash.\" (those being the TAME examples of some of these people)\n\nIronically enough, I think gameplay changes that encourage a more fluid and open meta would theoretically solve the majority (not all) of the issues of player elitism, since most of it's spawning from a stagnant metagame. More than half the arguments I've seen start in champ select when some guy bans an ally's hover and says something like \"that's a troll champ\" or cases where someone immediately flaming the ally for their pick when they lock it in, either of which then spirals the whole game into a constant tug-of-war between \"people are allowed to pick what they want\" and \"but op.gg says [shit] about the champ\" or \"But every time I see this champ they're shit\" instead of actually playing the game. Another like 1/5 come from build orders or playstyles, and the last like 30-ish% are performance based. These people are so hamstrung to their meta-physics (huehuehue) that literally any deviation instantly sets off half the community. So I would hold fast that they need to focus on *enjoyment* over *community witch hunts* in order to put the meta-slaves into a more open state of mind\n\nThe other 30-ish% are the people that make up the bottom rung of each rank like \"HA! I MADE IT! BOW BEFORE ME, PEASANTS, I'M FREAKING PLAT NOW! (plat is the example...they do it in every rank, and the people with 0LP in each division do it at any rung they're on to a lesser scale) and honestly those people are so overwhelmingly vocal about their \"special high status\" in chat that they almost always get rekt within their next few games...it's just...there's a freaking lot of them. These people are the ones you're gonna see in literally any community though, so these ones are the real cancer...there should definitely be a case against them, but we need to save the majority (the meta-jockeys) before containing the minority in this case.\n\nHonestly, I was joking about the name thing and said that more as satire, but if you insist, I'll do yours if you do mine, and lets just see what happens from it. I'll get a free name change out of it (I honestly want to change names anyway) if they come at me, and I get to confirm that Riot will take yours to mean \"magic mushrooms\" instead of \"Teemo owns you\" If they tag us both, win-win. :P","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"SHROOMTALITY","date":"2019-05-20T06:13:25.884+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Periscope best troll on this forum GJ dude.\n\n\"If you have any questions about this moderation action, don't hesitate to reach out to the Boards Moderation\"\n\nAS IF YOU'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO ANSWER AND TALK TO ANYONE LOL ","replies":[{"poster":"Periscope","date":"2019-05-20T21:01:33.597+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SHROOMTALITY,realm=EUNE,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=Ev3cYPuX,comment-id=000a0001,timestamp=2019-05-20T06:13:25.884+0000)\n>\n> AS IF YOU'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO ANSWER AND TALK TO ANYONE LOL\n\nSo do you ~~actually~~ have a question or complaint? \n\nI'd also advise against submitting screenshots via support; they have all of the info that occurs in the client.\n\nEdited.","replies":[{"poster":"SHROOMTALITY","date":"2019-05-20T22:03:21.201+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"\"So do you ACTUALLY have a question or complaint?\"\n\nok first of all drop the attitude if you're \"ACTUALLY\" capable of being polite otherwise .. ohh wait you're a moderator, the rules don't apply to u sry my bad keep trolling and being rude or whatever again i'm sry ..\n\n\"I'd also advise against submitting screenshots via support; they have all of the info that occurs in the client.\"\n\nWell obviously .. the problem is they don't do much with that data.\nMy questions have been answered by someone else don't worry i was rly expecting you to clarify anything or answer any questions.","replies":[{"poster":"Periscope","date":"2019-05-20T23:06:26.169+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"You seemed upset regarding the removals.

On the other hand that moderator is moderator no more.

In fact practically every one of them seems to be doing a good job, and Periscope is one of those whom I respect. He is polite, humble and his facts are practically always true.

determined to win. then why on earth would they instantly start flaming people, bashing them, and tilting them right before the match starts... all because they say they are new to ranked and trying to create a connection with their teammates to better help with the chances of winning said ranked match? yeah exactly what happened to me. if they were more serious about winning the match then they would refrain from acting like complete jack asses and help try to build moral within one another. so from my experience blind matches have always been far more cooperative and usually, but not always, more relaxed and better about working together and keeping a fun friendly and peaceful atmosphere. its kind of hard to focus and be in zen mode when you start getting harassed and flamed just for saying you are new to it within the first 2 minutes of the match. and then they blame you for losing..... mmm yeah it had nothing to do with the fact you all sacrificed some of your time, attention, and focus to flame and harass someone to the point of tilt which also lowered the overall chances of the match being won to begin with. \n\nblow that smoke of yours out of your own ass, don't try to blow it up someone else's.  your mentality of its ok to harass, bully, and flame someone and then blame them for losing the match is the only thing flawed here....   oh and then have everyone 10x report them because they stuck up to their dumb bully like bs.\n\nit really should be as simple as losing your coward like ego, putting on your big boy panties, and letting a match flow naturally and peacefully without losing your fucking minds and bitching at people.\n\ntaking it more serious does not give you the right to act like a coward and throw any man hood or dignity you may have away. unless you simply have neither one from the get go.\n\ngo cry and report me to one of the moderators on here that supports your bully like mentality.","replies":[{"poster":"KETSU0","date":"2019-05-19T23:45:28.651+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":">

gave. nobody had time to play serious or casually before they all lost their fucking minds simply because i said i was new to ranked. needless to say i never played many ranked games after that. it was not my life long dream in the first place to be high ranked in a video game. i have more important things in life going on to worry about. hence why i never feel the need to go off on somebody if they are doing bad or are new. losing a match in a video game is no reason to completely lose your fucking mind, and start bullying and harassing someone. and anyone who does, clearly does not have anything more important in their lives going on. im sorry. ill never deem any video game important enough to lose my mind and act like a stone aged primal cave man towards someone.  we are playing a
