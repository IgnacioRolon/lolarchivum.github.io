It only plays the sound in around a minute or so. This might not happen to you, but it is happening to me. So if it is happening to some other people, I'm just wondering if the sound is behind or just the number changes too early. Thank you for reading this, I'm out.\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nI search worthy prey... - Kha'Zix","replies":[{"poster":"BakedLotion","date":"2015-01-11T16:48:01.064+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The level up doesnt show up at all for me. \nMade me lose lane against a lvl 2 Riven","replies":[{"poster":"The Fire on Fire","date":"2015-01-12T00:14:47.003+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol thats sad {{champion:105}}","replies":[]}]}]}
