If we assume the tank has 200 armor he will have about 70% physical reduction meaning he will take 40 damage from each auto. If the adc is only dealing 40 damage he will only receive 4 health per hit with 10% lifesteal. If you include dorans blade and lifesteal masteries then he will recieve 6 health per hit.

To clarify, consider this situation, where one member from a team is fed and can guranteed do their job:\n\n-If the assassin is fed, the assassin can definitely kill the enemy ADC, thus theoretically rendering the enemy team unable to drop the assassin's tank and causing the assassin's team to win the teamfight.\n-If the Tank is fed, the tank requires an extensive amount of effort or time to kill, allowing the tanks teammates to do their jobs despite not being fed, thus allowing the tanks team to win the teamfight.\n-If the ADC is fed, they can drop the enemy Tank quickly, which leaves the enemy team without a frontline to protect their backline from the ADC's fighters and assassins.\n-If the Mage is fed, they can soften up the majority of the enemy team, allowing the Mage's fighters and assassins to take out the majority of the tank's team, resulting in a one-sided teamfight where the Mage's team can take all the time they need to drop the tank cuz he doesn't have damage backup.\n-If the Fighter is fed, then he can heavily punish, scare off, or zone the enemy tank, ***OR*** punish the enemy tank by assassinating their ADC or Mage when the enemy tank mis-positions or burns their peel. (As stated before, this is why Fighters are OP: too much versatility).\n\nPeople tend to examine champion ***kits*** and say \"oh this character can do X which means that they must be Y class\" which isn't always the case. For example, using Nautilus or Amumu as an example, people view their abilities and think they're meant to charge the backline. They're not, they're meant to use that heavy CC to peel off enemy fighters/assassins, or in Nautilius case his ult can be used to disrupt an enemy ADC or Mage long enough for the Nautilus' assassin to get to thenm, while the rest of Naut's CC is used to peel.","replies":[{"poster":"FreshAsFebreze","date":"2016-03-01T22:13:35.152+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well said.

Apologies for the vitriol, Riot's treatment of Ezreal outright pisses me the fuck off.\n\nCinderhulk era DEFINITELY had major, infuriating balancing problems and anyone who tells you otherwise has their nostalgia goggles on, but my opinion is that the meta should in any competitive game following a class structure like the one used by League should be using the Tanks are their baseline.\n\nTanks are the most important class in terms of design, and I am saying this as a through-and-through Assassin main (feel free to look me up on lolking or w/e if you don't believe me, I fuckin' love Assassins lol). If your Tanks are functioning properly, all the other classes can be designed and balanced significantly more easily and accurately.\nIn any other class-centric meta, they warp and distort the relationship of classes with each other. As an example, if Assassins are too strong, they invalidate most characters, because when Assassins are top of the meta Tanks aren't strong enough to punish them and the game revolves around \"which assassin gets fed\" and teamfights degenerate into an assassin dropping half the enemy team without meaningful repercussions (fed Talon is a great example of how un-fun and un-interactive an Assassin meta can be: Just extrapolate Talon into an entire class and you have an Assassin meta).\n\nFixing an Assassin meta is incredibly frustrating.\n- How much damage should they do?\n- Do tanks need more damage to stop them? If so, does that make tanks too good at being fighters?\n- Should fighters get tankier or more damage to punish assassins? Do they need buffs at all?\n- Do ADCs need to become safer? If so does that push into an ADC meta?\n\nThe list can go on for ages, I just don't wanna type out more questions that you have to ask lol.\n\nHowever, when ***Tanks*** are the centric class, every other class can receive minor tuning to bring them in line with relation to tanks.\n\n- If ADCs aren't dropping tanks, buff their %hp damage output to bring them to the state you want. No repercussions\n- If Assassins aren't able to assassinate because tanks are too strong, give Assassins more mobility options or nerf vision slightly.\n- If Fighters can't punish tanks who position poorly, examine fighters on a per-champion basis and buff relevant fighters (buffing \"fighters\" as a class almost assuredly fucks up class relationships. Juggernauts gave some examples of this (Fiora, anyone?))\n- If mages are exceptionally weak, it's usually not directly related to tanks and rather is related to their interactions with other classes, however granting more CC to the class (within reason) allows the mages to potentially control Tanks to a degree required. Alternatively, nerfing Tenacity is usually the route Riot has taken in the past to accomplish the same thing. Lastly, mages have significant diversity on a per-champion basis with regards to their best target. Malzahar for example can make tanks his bitch, if you build for that (it's honestly the biggest reason to pick Malzahar imo, since other mages do his other things better)\n\nAll of that information is an awfully roundabout way for me to say \"This meta kinda fucking sucks.\"\nFrankly, I've been of the opinion since around the end of season 2 that Riot needs to undergo a major class rebalancing. If they just bit the bullet and redesigned from the ground up, League would be an infinitely better, significantly less frustrating game. But due to their dependency on E-Sports, the likelihood of that happening is very slim, as they'd have to ACTUALLY stop playing favorites with champions they like that outright break their own design but are flashy (not going to name any names but I'm sure most people are aware of a couple that I'm referring to).","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"darkdill","date":"2016-03-01T01:40:59.507+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":6,"body":"The thing is, Thornmail's design is a tad toxic itself.

They were designed to balance against each other, with Life Steal and Thornmail being the natural steps to evolve that.  \n\nThe problem is, Life Steal continued finding it's way onto more and more Items, allowing it to be stacked far more than Return Damage (Thornmail) can be stacked.  The one thing that kept Thornmail up as long as it did was the fact it returned Damage based on the 'Before' or 'Pure' Damage dealt, not the amount after mitigating via Armor and other things (like 10% Reduced Damage vs. Auto Attacks from Ninja Tabi's)... so the Tank only had to take the Mitigated Portion while the ADC suffered the Return based on % of Non-Mitigated Damage on Auto Attacks.\n\nIf any attempt is made that Attack Damage should directly defeat Armor, then they need to close shop due to stupidity.  Ability Power beats Armor, like Attack Damage beats MR, True Damage defeats Armor and MR, and % Max Health defeats HP.  % Current HP is just a small bonus against High HP Targets that loses effectiveness as the HP Pool lowers, so a Starter... with % Missing HP being an Execution.\n\nSo no, it was never intended for AD to Beat Armor since the entire purpose of Armor is to mitigate that Attack Damage.  It was intended that it take the Tank forever to kill the AD (Kiting) due to crap damage, while the AD has to keep the distance to avoid finally being pummeled to death.  The Tank taking forever to kill the AD allowed the APC to blast the Tank down to a manageable level of HP to be finished.  \n\nIt is the AP's job to bypass the Armor by using AP instead of AD, thus rendering all the Gold spent on Armor useless for the Tank when being focused by the AP Members of the Enemy Team.\n\nFighting Armor with AD should be akin to fighting fire with fire.  The last thing an ADC should want to hit is something stacking Armor.  The last thing an APC should want to hit is something stacking MR.\n\nSo if the idea is the ADC is DESIGNED to beat a Tank... then they've already screwed up beyond belief.\n\nGenerally Tanks have held their own as well, but then Riot lowered the AP on a few 120 AP Items down to 100 and did a general Rework of Mage Items... suddenly Tanks didn't die as quickly.  So, in typical Riot fashion the idea was to (1) nerf Tank Items then (2) Buff AD Items to make Tanks die again.  Instead of just, you know, putting back the 120 AP Items.","replies":[{"poster":"Anidan","date":"2016-03-01T05:46:07.915+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":2,"body":"I'll answer this simply: \n\nTanks are akin to raid bosses in terms of durability, comparative to game type.\nWhat do you value in raids in terms of taking it down? High sustained damage.\nYou know who has the highest sustained damage through their design? ADCs. \n\nYou know what has very low value against a raid boss? Burst damage. \nYou know what tends to be more dependent on burst damage? Casters of any sort, which would include most AP champions due to their cooldown-based nature and low damage AAs between cooldowns.\n\nPart of the AP's job is to make it so the tank can't afford to spend all his gold on armor, _NOT_ to punch through the tank themselves because for the most part, they're much worse at killing the tank due to their bursty nature. \n\nTanks have 1 form of multiplicative defense (armor x health = EHP) against AD Carries, whereas AD Carries have 2 multiplicative forms of damage adding up together with a base (AD x attacks per second x Crits = DPS). Mages have one form of multiplicative offense (AP x AP scaling of combo). \n\nIt is not bad design for AD Carries to naturally counter a tank because of their naturally high sustained damage. You don't take a PvP-oriented character in an MMO with their 50-75% crit rate and minimal haste (that they'd use for repeated burst patterns against players) against a boss and expect them to have the throughput necessary to keep up with the guys building Haste and a bit lower crit for sustained combat. \n\nAP Champions are _not_ the tank-busters (with a couple special exceptions), ADCs are. That's why armor items have to be stronger than MR items - that way they're strong against burst ADs but the sustained ADs are going to continue doing their job, just a bit slower.\n\nIn short: Yes. ADCs are designed to counter Tanks. And no, that is not bad design. That is basic game design dictating that.","replies":[{"poster":"KillerKell","date":"2016-03-01T06:16:25.407+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":8,"body":"Except this isn't a Raid.\n\nIf I had 1,000,000 HP and everyone on the 'Enemy Team' had 5,000... sure.

A Raid Boss requires many to take down JUST himself.\n\nSo your entire premise is flawed... by the exact fact than a Tank CAN be 1v1'd, something NO Raid Boss should be capable of falling to.\n\nAD should not counter a Tank stacking Armor.  Period.  At all.  It should require the BY PASS of the Armor (like Armor Pen, or Ability Power, or True Damage, or % Max/Current HP... all of which for some reason a lot of ADC can now get in the form of Items and/or Scaling Abilities).\n\nThe reason an ADC can beat a Tank today is because they can BotRK can get large chunks out of those first few shots, while negating 30% of the Armor Built, plus negating some Flat Armor, plus adding some AP Ratio to deal Magic Damage to by-pass the Armor, on top of gaining Sustain through Life Steal which should be way more than enough since the Tank SHOULD NOT be able to BURST the ADC, so the Sustain will out-pace the incoming damages.\n\nIn other words, we've now given the ADC pretty much every form of Damage possible through a combination of Items, Abilities and Buffs.\n\nAn ADC should have to Specialize, which is where Builds come in.  An ADC building Pure Damage+Crit should be able to burn through a Squish (Low HP Target), but have a much larger issue when that Damage is by a Tank (High Resistances) and take some time on a Beef (High HP)\n\nWhere then an ADC should have to, when facing Tanks instead of Beef, go deeper into Armor Pen to crack the Tank... which would LOWER his Overall Damage against those NOT building Armor, so now he's not hitting that Enemy ADC as hard because he Spec'd for the Tank Target instead.

Just because the situation is not 1 for 1 does not make it automatically wrong. Note that I loosely compared durability, not coordinated effort. \n\nA tank is durable enough that burst will be less effective, which makes it a far less effective means of dealing with a tank, high armor or high MR. This leaves the best option as sustained DPS, which is much less common in AP champions. This leaves mostly AD Champions, however, therein exists a class of AD Casters that function also primarily through burst, so those champions are also less effective at dealing with tanks, even if that tank has MR built, due to the raw health the tank will have. This tends to leave most ADCs (only most, because some are effectively AD Casters that rely on burst, but those champions tend to want to end the game quickly before the tank really starts rolling) because their standard build path has them flaunting some of the highest sustained DPS in the game, routinely, which is the best way to deal with a tank, regardless of what they have built. A 4000 HP tank with, say, 100 MR but 300 Armor will still be handled much more easily by that Sivir, Ashe, Draven, Jinx, etc., than AP Champions like Orianna, Lux, LeBlanc, etc. Why? The sustained damage those ADCs put out due to their build path. \n\nTanks are naturally countered by how AD Carries are played and built. That is their intention. Even if that tank has  300 armor but only 100 MR, that tank is still going to die easier to the high sustained damage of an ADC than the burst of a mage. AD isn't the answer to their armor or their MR, but their sustained damage is the answer to their wall - they are drilling at it until it breaks. That's the core of why ADCs counter tanks, not some inane interaction with AD and Armor or MR.","replies":[{"poster":"KillerKell","date":"2016-03-01T17:12:29.329+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"Which is part of the problem.\n\nBut I would suggest strongly that coordination IS the key to killing a Tank, the idea that ONE Champion can just destroy a Tank is wrong to begin with.\n\nWhen you get an ADC dealing as much with a Single Basic Attack as a Mage is getting for his Ability that has a Cool Down... it gets sort of idiotic.\n\nWhat SHOULD kill a Tank is a mix of Burst and Sustained Damages of varying Types.  I mean, that IS the reason of being a Tank... to draw the Focus of the Enemy Team.  Not to draw the focus of the ADC who deletes you then moves on to everything else.\n\nWe also tend to think that Burst Damage doesn't work... but it's a large part of it.  If Katarina can Ult after the Tank has used his Disrupt, she can take a HUGE chunk out of the Tank.  Sure, she likely won't kill it unless extremely fed, but she'll take the Tank down to a manageable amount of HP that others can finish off.\n\nThe only reason a Tank should ever die 1v1 when on equal footing is when they find themselves caught in a Kite, to far to engage but not far enough to disengage, slowly being taken down.  This should take a large amount of time, as the Armor vs. the AD should be High and the HP Pool should be Large.  So even with this the ADC should have to decide if he just disengages to safety or continues after the Tank in this dance while he COULD be getting flanked.\n\nWhat it SHOULD NOT BE is the ADC grabbing a Last Whisper Item and instantly chunking off 45% of the Armor built (plus Grievous Wounds to negate 40% of all types of Healing, if going Mortal Reminder), and then being able to waltz around and 1v1 anyone in short order.\n\nThink about that, 1 Item an ADC buys for 2,700 Gold instantly invalidates 45% of the Gold spent on Armor and 40% of the Gold spent on Sustain.  2,700 Gold does that, instantly.\n\nAnd THAT is why the ADC beats the Tank, because with 2,700 Gold an ADC can turn 15,000 Gold spent on Armor and Regen into about 7,500 Gold.  Can INSTANTLY turn a 6 Item Full Tank into a 3 Item Tank.\n\nObviously, a 6 Item ADC should crap all over a 3 Item Tank.\n\nThis is where the entire 'ADC beats Tank' comes from... the fact that even before Lord's and Mortal, one Item could ignore 35% of the Gold/Items a Tank Built.  Even then it was like a 6 Item ADC vs. a 4 Item Tank.\n\nThe combination of needing to Stack Armor for it to truly be effective, and the Diminishing Returns that Armor brings... just to have 1/2 of it negated by 2,700 Gold, is stupid.\n\nConcentrated Damage, i.e. FOCUSED Damage, SHOULD be what kills Tanks, both of the Burst and Sustained variety.  The Trade Off is that the Tank itself shouldn't be effective at killing anything (it's why we have Bruisers, Brawlers and Juggernauts... to deal Damage... the TRUE Tank is just there to disrupt and absorb focus).\n\nWhich leads to the common 'ignore the Tank, focus the Carries' mantra.  Because, in theory, the Tank shouldn't be able to kill you unless you let him on top of you and forget he's there... so you take out the threats that CAN burst you away into nothingness... THEN use the remaining TEAM to either Finish the Tank, or ignore him as you push an Objective.\n\nInstead now it's Pop the Tank, then GO!  Because 2,700 Gold renders a Tank completely useless against some one that he specifically BUILT to be able to withstand, thus wasting every bit of Gold he has spent the entire game.\n\nIt's down right idiotic.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"ChaoticPinecone","date":"2016-03-01T14:47:17.930+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Heres how the general roles tend to play out: \n\nBurst > Squishy Sustained damage.\nSquishy Sustained Damage > Tanks. \nTanks > Burst. \n\nOf course there are exceptions and its a range of options - some mages are squishier than tanks, but tankier than other mages (Swain, Vlad).

Let's assume 500 AD, then let's give that 250% assuming Infinity Edge.  That's 1,250 Damage.  (500+500+250).\n\nThornmail returns 15% of the 1,250.  So 125 and 62.5, for 187.5 Damage Returned to Caitlyn for hitting and critting on a Thornmail.\n\nWhile the Thornmail Champion would look something like this.  Let's assume 50% Damage Reduction from Armor, 10% vs. Basic Attacks from Tabi and 10% from Crits from Randuin's.\n\nThis goes one of three ways, depending if Ninja Tabi and Randuin's are calculated before, after or with Tabi.\n\n1.

Now 1,175 loses 117.50 due to Tabi, dropping to 1057.5.  From here you take down 50% due to Armor, for an Actual Damage Received of 528.75.\n\nHere we would have Damage Received of 528.75, with a Damage Returned of 187.5.\n\n3.  AFTER:  So you take the 1250, drop it by 50% due to Armor... 625.  Of the 625 you'd lose 10% to Tabi for 62.5 down to 562.5 Damage.  The Crit portion is now confusing for me, as I feel it should be 325 left reduced by 32.5.  So 530 Damage Received.\n\nWhich leads to 530 Damage Received and 187.5 Damage Returned.\n\nSo reducing BEFORE the Armor would be better than After, but taking everything down TOGETHER would be the best (for the Tank) by a large margin.
