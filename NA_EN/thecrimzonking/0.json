I'm assuming board level should be the same as summoner level because I don't see any FAQ or Guide that outlines how to increase board levels, but I've been playing LoL for about 2 years and am level 30 in game.  How do I increase my board level so I can post in all the forums?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-26T02:13:37.187+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sometimes it takes a little bit for your boards level to correctly sync up with your Summoner Level. Once you posted here, it must have forced an update, because you're showing up as a full grown level 30 now ^_^!","replies":[]}]}
