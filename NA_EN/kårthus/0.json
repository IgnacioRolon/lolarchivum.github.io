After the game it booted us to the main screen without any ability to see match results, it was impossible to report him. He does not show up in the 'recently played' and has a completely empty match history on all \nprofile websites and his profile despite playing this game. I have screen caps of the NA OP GG in game (which is now unavailable), the replay of the game in question, and several other screen shots.\n\nhttps://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=killerst","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-30T21:11:22.731+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"No worries, we did some investigating and noticed some strange stuff going on (only 1 summoner spell what the HECK?!).
