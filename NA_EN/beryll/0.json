That combined with letting him Taunt Monsters and moving some of the damage on his kit into his E would be pretty sweet.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Eyrgos","date":"2015-03-11T20:23:33.087+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=XdEfV8w1,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2015-03-11T17:42:36.169+0000)\n>\n> Kalista's passive's the dash most affected by slows certainly.

The greater the slow %, the greater the distance-reduction.\n\nI think this would be a very interesting mechanic to help combat mobility creep in general.\n\nIt could, however, just be a special-case for her being that her passive gives her overloaded kiting potential.\n\nI also love how Veigar's box now stops dashes in their tracks, another good mechanic to begin incorporating more.\n\nMaybe Jarvan's wall can't be dashed over or Thresh' box stops dashes too (or reduces their max-distance based on the slow % like with the top suggestion).\n\nMaybe, just maybe Flash gets turned into a dash instead of a blink so it has more, wait for it, counterplay.","replies":[{"poster":"Mike Kachowski","date":"2015-05-01T11:19:45.155+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Eyrgos,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=XdEfV8w1,comment-id=000200000003,timestamp=2015-03-11T20:23:33.087+0000)\n>\n> What do you think about my idea to have her dash **distance** reduced by slows?
