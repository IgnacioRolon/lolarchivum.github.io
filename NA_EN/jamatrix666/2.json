I just wanted to give my opinion about Bard, specifically his abilities. Before going into that, I would like to mention that I believe that Bard&#039;s role and identity are very well established. He&#039;s also unique, interesting and refreshing to play. \n\nThat being said, I also think his extremely low win rate is due to the fact pretty much every gameplay aspects of him have clear (and somewhat exaggerated) downsides that makes him hard to be truly beneficial to his team.\n\nWhile it is true that Riot has buffed him since his release, but I am scared base stat increases and a few ratio upgrade won&#039;t fix his real problems. I may be wrong about this tho, only time will tell us.\n\nPassive (Traveler&#039;s Call): Some Chimes appear way too far away from him. For sure, great Bard players are going to wait until they have a nice opportunity before getting them, but the fact remains that a Chime that appears away in a moment when you better not go and take it is an useless Chime for X amount of time. **Possible tweaking:** Reduce the range on where the Chimes can appears around Bard. Maybe even make it scale with the ult ranks \"New Ult Passive, every rank put in his ult reduces the maximum distance where Chimes appears from Bard.\"\n\nQ (Cosmic Binding): I respect the stun condition since it is what separates the good Bard players from the great, right? The thing is that pretty much every other Supports have a much reliable CC. **Possible tweaking:** Increase the slow/stun duration to 1.6/1.7/1.8/1.9/2.0 seconds.\n\nW (Caretaker&#039;s Shrine): Again, I respect the delay from the shrine to be stronger over time... But 10 seconds? That&#039;s enormous. So many things can happen in 10 seconds. **Possible tweaking:** Reduce the amount of seconds it takes for the shrine to have the maximum heal to 10/9/8/7/6 (goes down every rank put in the ability)\n\nE (Magical Journey): The trickiest of all his abilities. It&#039;s already hard enough to know when and where to place it in a way it will positively affect the game, allowing enemies to use it for the full duration doesn&#039;t seem right... **Possible tweaking:** Enemies who use Magical Journey lose X% of their maximum health as magic damage every second they are in the vortex. This way, long vortex(es?) won&#039;t be so appealing to the enemy team. Possibility of adding a AP ratio for more damage similar to Amumu&#039;s Despair.  \n\nR (Tempered Fate): Since this ability defines Bard so much and is so unique, I think it is reasonable to let it as it is. \n\nFinal note: The numbers given in the \"Possible tweaking\" can be tweaked for the better since they basically just served as concrete examples for my suggestions. What do you guys think, opinions?\n\nEdit no 1: I forgot to mention this; I am not saying Bard needs all those tweaking suggestions to be in a good spot. 1 or 2 of them would probably suffice.","replies":[{"poster":"khorney","date":"2015-04-10T15:02:39.734+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"His q needs a longer range","replies":[{"poster":"Mikal Pikal","date":"2015-04-10T15:18:58.075+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah I think if they changed his q to act like lissandra's, where it goes further after the the initial impact, it would be much much better.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kingsgrave","date":"2015-04-10T08:52:29.641+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"His kit is also so highly situational I don't think we will ever see him played consistently.

I played around five games with him today, and I feel like he's in a much better place. At level 2, his Q and two autos will take about 1/4 health from a squishy, and with 5-10 meeps it increases to about 1/3. If you manage a stun, you get even more AAs (albeit meepless, but it's still damage). In most games, by level two the enemy carry is half health, so I set up a couple health shrines and collect chimes.\n\nThe only case where I feel Bard is a liability is if he gets caught out while roaming. If he dies to the jungler, his adc can expect a 3v1 very shortly afterward. Roaming will not only collect you meeps, but it will lvl your adc faster, giving you lvl 6 before the enemy. And if the lane is rough and you can't roam, you're still useful as a support.\n\nSomeone said Bard has sustain issues, and I'm sorry but that's wrong. I've had games where I don't back at all until about fifteen minutes in. Shrines and Chimes can be used strategically to keep both your mana bar and health bar full, and it's not that hard to do. \n\nAnother thing I don't understand is why people hate his Magical Journey. Yes, enemies can use it, but you go through faster, which gives you distance. AND they come out right next to a what? You guessed it; a wall! If only we had an ability to pin enemies to walls...\n\nAnother thing I've found useful is to set up shrines leading to your tower. If an enemy chases you, you have 2-3 speed boosts and heals to get you to safety. If I were to improve any ability though it would be his heal. What I'd do is make them stealthed units similar to Teemo shrooms (the exact opposite really. instead of damaging and slowing an enemy you're healing and speeding an ally), that way you can hide them anywhere in lane to sneak an advantage in. \n\nAll in all, I agree he's not the strongest and he has a high skill cap, but he's definitely not the worst support in the roster (hello Zilean). His buffs have improved him from unplayable to a high risk high reward, with a decent (yes decent) laning phase. The riskiest aspect of Bard is, of course, his ulti. I've found that I don't use his ult at all in teamfights, but it's great for: a) catching people out, stalling them to let your team catch up. b) suppressing the enemy adc/support long enough to safely take out the other. c) ohmwrecking the enemy tower to safely towerdive.\n\nI agree though, his abilities shouldn't all have downsides, and despite my wall of text defending him, I believe he could be improved (maybe a choice ability ulti similar to TF's pick a card, where you can choose ally/enemy/both, or even eliminating travel time so it's just an aoe zhonias). But I feel like a lot of you are basing your opinion on the one game you tried him. There are a lot of champions I love to play that took some getting used to. Janna and Braum took a lot of games to figure out, and I still can't play Lulu (I like to support :D). I feel like if you give him time, more people will pick him up and we'll finally figure out how he's best played and where he fits in.","replies":[{"poster":"Jamatrix666","date":"2015-04-11T06:30:41.053+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First of all, thank you for your constructive, well-written post. \n\nOddly enough, even being the OP of this thread, I do agree on pretty much everything you mentioned. I did try Bard a couple of time since patch 5.7 and it is true that his early game has been boosted decently and his Q hits noticeably more (a little bit). Your tips and tricks are accurate, I noticed I've been instinctively doing what you have been talking about and it makes Bard a champion that can have a positive influence on the game despite everything people say about him. \n\nI guess my main point of this thread can be resumed like this: I myself believe that conditional power in a champion's kit is very interesting since it really separates the good players from the great ones. However, Bard is an example of slightly overwhelming weaknesses, conditions and counterplayability. In other words, his \"downsides\" seem somewhat exaggerated to the point that it is much harder for Bard to be beneficial for his team compared to other -much safer- Supports.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"JumbaJoopleakley","date":"2015-04-10T17:19:25.979+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel like the thing that needs to be changed most is his heal. \nFor being a heal that:\nA. Can miss (people don't walk over it)\nB. Can heal less than it should (people walk over it before it's done.\nC. Takes ten seconds to be useful\nd. Can be interrupted by enemies\nYou'd think it would be one of the best heals in the game, but it heals the same as Soraka's and Taric's at max. With all these downsides you'd think it would be better. Even worse, at max rank it's min heal is 150, but it's max is only 230. at rank one the min is 30 and the max is 70, so it loses potency as it levels up. All these boosts to his damage don't mean anything because he's not a poke support. Riot should stop being afraid of him becoming a jungler because no one's going to do it, just make him an effective support. I like playing bard, but constantly having people call me a troll and having games cancelled when i pick him shows that they've done wrong with this champ.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sirsir","date":"2015-04-10T17:15:46.291+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":">  Maybe even make it scale with the ult ranks \"New Ult Passive, every rank put in his ult reduces the maximum distance where Chimes appears from Bard.\"\n\nThat wouldn't fix the problem, people heading out in the middle of the lane phase to collect. (They last for TEN MINUTES PEOPLE) It should just favor Bards side of the map a lot more. It really ricks me off when I see a chime right in the enemy turret range...\n\nQ needs a longer range, in some form. Maybe make it work like Liss's, it resets the range on hitting an enemy. Another possible use would be for it to count hitting the wall first as a stun condition (stunning from across the wall)\n\nI like the W idea. Maybe add some to the base at later levels as well, 230 isn't much except for right after you max it.\n\nE is a really neat idea... Obviously it would be weak, and I wouldn't give it much of an AP ratio. Or maybe enemies travel through it are given a small debuff that increases damage dealt to them/reduces the damage they deal.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AbsoluteSadman","date":"2015-04-10T23:49:18.428+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"\"ALL THESE CHAMPIONS HAVE NO DOWNSIDES\"\n\nBard is released\n\n\"BARD HAS DOWNSIDES WTF HE SUCKS\"\n\ni love this community","replies":[{"poster":"Jamatrix666","date":"2015-04-11T00:22:53.160+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You are not really getting the point.

In order for Bard to bring the jungler into a gank, he has to be *in the jungle with them*, meaning his ADC is probably already zoned or dead; in order for him to bring an ally out of a fight, his squishy ass has to be right in the middle of it with them.\n\nAnd lantern is MUCH faster, can't be used by enemies AT ALL, and you can choose whether to lantern over a wall or along a lane.\n\nAbout the only advantage of Magical Journey by comparison is that multiple allies can use it, and Bard can use it to move himself (but not really to escape, because enemies can just follow).\n\nWhat about other advantages that could be added to it... allies who travel gain some buff for a few seconds after exiting?
