Something I've been doing since a while, something that made me enjoy my games more and even perform better. \n\nAs a player, I've never been the rage type guy, more like the silent&amp;sarcastic guy. So for instance, when one of my team mate would screw up, I would either say something harmless but useless or be silent about it. And then I recently told myself that maybe I can do more than that to help. It came to me naturally to think about something simple but that would be worth the try.\n\nBasically, it's just about being more human and empathic. 3 words came to my mind, gratefulness, forgiveness and cooperation. \n\n- Gratefulness is all about acknowledging your team mate's nice work when it happens, especially when it comes to ganks or any kind of help. When you're glad someone gave you blue buff, ganked for you, let you the kill, pinged something important to you, etc., thank him/her. It doesn't have to be complicated, it just needs to become a reflex. Soon you'll notice people are more likely to keep assisting you when you acknowledge the good moves they make.\n\n- In the same state of mind than gratefulness, forgiveness is about to inform the other player that you're not mad/pissed at them for failing a certain task. A gank gone wrong, overcomitting, getting greedy and getting killed etc. It's not always necessary to tell them not to do that again, most of the time a simple \"it's alright man let's just be a little bit safer next time :)\" is more than enough to make mistakes something people can learn from rather than a sign of weakness. People even thank me on a regular basis when I act like that. They seem kind of relieved that I don't take things too much in a negative way. And since they know I'm chill, they have less stress and perform better than if I would just be toxic. I know it can sound cheesy and only good on paper, but you guys have nothing to lose and honestly, I think it's just gonna make your games more enjoyable.\n\n- Cooperation, while a little bit different than the 2 main aspects of this thread, is primordial to make gratefulness and forgiveness tools that make your team united and better. It's as simple as pinging, asking to ward, telling when your ult is gonna come back, asking help to set up an ambush using sweeper, help to kill the scuttle crab, etc. Don't be shy to ask, remember you're playing with people like you who want to win like you do. Finishing your sentence with a \"please\" and/or smiley face shows that you're asking as a friend, someone who doesn't try to be the boss of anyone but someone who's just trying his best to win the game. Also, at the beginning of each game, I ask everyone how was their day, I can compliment someone's skin, ask their opinion about item choices for this game... It can sound stupid but it kind of relax everyone you know? Like when you play with complete strangers, you can have this anxiety of playing with rude people or trolls right? By sharing your good mood and showing that you want to have a good time, it pushes people to do the best they can. \n\nSo, in short, showing a little bit of kindness throughout the game makes you a human being, not just another \"pixelated moving character\" in the game and people appreciate to know that.    \n\nPlease take note that this is irrelevant when talking to a troll, since most of them are immune to kindness and have a lack of social abilities and/or sh*t to give about you or the game.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-05-29T00:58:08.285+0000","up_votes":46,"down_votes":1,"body":"+1! \n\nI recently had a game where someone on my team panic-locked Hecarim.

I covered her lane, and of course Yi is trash in lane and despite my efforts to play safe gave first blood to enemy {{champion:266}}. Gave up lane and went to the jungle, and he took first turret. Riven came back and went to lane, asked for help because Aatrox was zoning her hard with the farm and level advantage. I was frustrated, and told her it's not my job to clean her lane up for her and that it was her fault for being AFK and that she needs to deal with her own problems and stop begging for someone to fix her mess, and went back to farming jg. Instead of responding in the same toxic manner I did, she calmly responded \"Ok.\". \n\nI saw her taking Gromp, and thought she was taking my camp to spite me so I got to it and smited it away at the last second. I then realized she was taking Gromp because she was really struggling to get farm, since Aatrox refused to let her near his minions, and she was genuinely doing her best to catch up in gold without risking giving a kill to Aatrox. I felt really bad about raging at her and then denying her only safe farm, so I pinged Aatrox and ganked him, we got the kill and survived. Afterward, I told her I felt horrible about raging at her and that I was just frustrated about the AFK, and she completely understood and accepted the apology. Me and the team helped her get further caught up in lane and eventually she was able to help us secure a victory. I apologized once again in post-game about my behavior, she said she understood my frustration and I told her I appreciated her being patient with me while I was being unpleasant, we honored and added eachother.\n\nIt's important to note that had Riven reacted to my toxicity with aggression, the game likely would have ended differently. I would have seen her taking Gromp as a scumbag move, and would have avoided helping her get caught up, or even worse we would have spent the rest of the game arguing and never reconciled. I'm not saying that my initial behavior was excusable, but I was frustrated and on tilt, and Riven was the better player and allowed my attitude to simmer down instead of feed my anger by arguing with me.
