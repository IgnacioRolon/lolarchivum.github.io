Many youtubers and streamers have stopped putting content on their channels (except for the professionals, who don't play real life league), making the game seem too hardcore for the potential newcomer. Hell, VideoGameDunkey, who was League's biggest youtuber, makes videos dissing League.\nWith this in mind, League probably hit its peak. The only way it can go now is down.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Slythion","date":"2018-04-02T00:08:47.116+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"How the fuck did you get this argument\n\n> \"League is not dying dude its always the number 1\"\n\nand not have seen the *much* more popular counterargument \n\n> Fortnite is a new hype train that will be dead in 6 months.\n\nWe literally see your kind of posts every time a new game comes out and you people always get the same response.

It is **very** relevant in search engines right now (which explains why streamers and youtubers are making momentary switches to fortnite, it's to gain more viewers). It also appeals to a very wide, mostly untapped child audience, one that LoL has no hope of getting into. \n\nPeople said tha OW was killing league, but OW is currently getting almost a seventh of LoL's viewers.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dasdi96","date":"2018-04-02T02:16:55.032+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love how people are comparing an FPS to a MOBA.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ValiantKiller","date":"2018-04-02T02:15:59.619+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But twitch numbers isn't the number of players that play game...it numbers of people watching a tv show....\n\nWait wait does that mean the numbers that play both games are different than the people watching them ?
