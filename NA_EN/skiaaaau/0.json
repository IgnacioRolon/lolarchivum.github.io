Then all of a sudden I que up for another one, and after champion select my screen just goes blue and \"No Signal\". Game starts, I hear no sound from the rift so I know the game did not even load for me. Remake... This happens every single time since then, did multiple tests in custom game mode.\r\nReinstalled 2 times, once with the \"old\" client (that I am normally using) and once with the new one, still have the same problem. Googled for some answers but didn't find any to solve my problem. \r\nI am out of ideas, this should be the best place to find a solution, so please, help me.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-21T18:16:18.489+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There was an issue previously resulting in that error, and pressing Alt+Enter served as a workaround.
