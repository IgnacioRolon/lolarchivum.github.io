I mainly jungle so I want to fill my first rune page (or first two pages) now. I have around 11k IP on my account.\r\n\r\nI jungled a lot with {{champion:19}} in the last weeks because of his sustain. But when {{champion:254}} was in the weekly champion rotation I bought here because she really made a lot of fun. In the games I had problems with the first clears, but now with runes I hope to make better use of her and want to be here my most used champ.\r\n\r\nI now want rune-pages for both of these champions (priority on {{champion:254}})and will wait until 21.01. because of the special runes-offer by riot then.\r\n\r\nBut I don't know how to decide which ones I should buy. attack damage, attack speed, armor penetration? How to decide which one is better? Is there some kind of calculator which tells which rune has which influence in DPS or so? \r\n\r\nThey only thing I am certain now is that I buy 9 yellow flat-armor runes but I don't know which else I should buy.\r\n\r\nHope you can help me.\r\n\r\nCheers","replies":[{"poster":"Laughing Fish","date":"2015-01-14T20:09:48.217+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here is what I have when I use {{champion:19}} or {{champion:254}} (it works for plenty of other champs as well):\nGreater Mark of Attack Damage x9 = +8.55 flat Attack damage\nGreater Seal of Armor x9 = +9 flat armor\nGreater Glyph of Scaling Magic Resist x9 = +1.44 MR per level (+27 at level 18)\nGreater Quintessence of Attack Speed x3 = +13.5% Attack speed","replies":[{"poster":"ChimeiTekinaNasu","date":"2015-01-15T00:12:44.429+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Laughing Fish,realm=NA,application-id=WEuoGbmp,discussion-id=jk3VkWKg,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-01-14T20:09:48.217+0000)\n>\n> Here is what I have when I use {{champion:19}} or {{champion:254}} (it works for plenty of other champs as well):\n> Greater Mark of Attack Damage x9 = +8.55 flat Attack damage\n> Greater Seal of Armor x9 = +9 flat armor\n> Greater Glyph of Scaling Magic Resist x9 = +1.44 MR per level (+27 at level 18)\n> Greater Quintessence of Attack Speed x3 = +13.5% Attack speed\n\n^This.

For Vi probably flat AD reds, flat AD quints, flat armor yellows, and either flat MR blues or flat CDR blues (or a mix of the two; I think 6 flat CDR blues give you 5% CDR), depending if you're facing a lot of magic damage or not. Vi could also use that WW page perfectly fine I think.","replies":[{"poster":"ChimeiTekinaNasu","date":"2015-01-15T00:29:27.011+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MrBuffington,realm=NA,application-id=WEuoGbmp,discussion-id=jk3VkWKg,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2015-01-15T00:18:58.458+0000)\n>\n> I forget, if you're lvl 20, do you have access to Tier 3 runes?

Reds are most efficient with an offensive stat and quints are great for a lot of reasons. Blues can also grab cooldown reduction or AP as well though.\n\nFor yellow (seals) flat armor is a great default for all positions, especially jungle. It helps you sustain much better in the jungle. Minions and towers do physical damage as well, and there are usually more AD champs than AP champs every game.\n\nFor blues magic resist is the most gold efficient if you're in a game that you'll be taking magic damage. Both flat and scaling are good choices. For jungling I would go scaling because you're usually level 3 by the time you'll gank. Most scaling runes (not all) break even with their flat version at level 6.\n\nFor AD jungles attack damage reds and attack speed quints are a safe powerful general combination. They also serve as the best ADC setup generally too. The attack speed stat is really great for helping jungle clear compared to other stats dps wise, but is usually not as strong as AD or penetration versus champions. I pretty much recommend having either attack speed quints or reds if jungling most champions.\n\nFor whatever reason AD quints have a weaker ratio of stats compared to its red version than other offensive stats.\n\n**To summerize**, these are the strongest starter runes you should look out for:\nflat AD reds\nAttack speed quints\nMagic Pen reds (for AP champions)\nflat AP quints (for ap)\nflat armor yellows\nmagic resist blues (flat or scaling)","replies":[{"poster":"Jamnon","date":"2015-01-15T00:22:32.230+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"^ Can we sticky this or post of the day or something? ^","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BD Wilton","date":"2015-01-14T23:01:16.198+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Flat Armor Seals, Scaling MR Glyphs are standard for many champs.","replies":[]},{"poster":"fluffymc","date":"2015-01-15T16:11:08.800+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How do you play?
