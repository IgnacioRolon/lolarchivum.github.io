I wasn't able to CTRL ALT Delete out, so I turned off my computer. When I try again, same issue. I already uninstalled reinstalled, looked for updates, turned off cortana, virus scanned and didn't have any luck. I then read some posts about it having to do with either my ram, graphics card, or cpu. So i ran a stress test for CPU GPU and memory and I passed all three. I have no clue what I can do it fix this issue, please help! \r\n\r\nIntel(R) HD Graphics 5500\r\n\r\nReport Date: Friday, August 26, 2016\r\nReport Time [hh:mm:ss]: 12:04:32 AM\r\nDriver Version: 20.19.15.4454\r\nOperating System: Windows* 10 Home (10.0.14393)\r\nDefault Language: English (United States)\r\nPhysical Memory: 8102 MB\r\nVendor ID: 8086\r\nDevice ID: 1616\r\nDevice Revision: 09\r\nGraphics Output Protocol (GOP) Version: 5.5.1028\r\nCurrent Resolution: 1366 x 768\r\n\r\nProcessor: Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-5200U CPU @ 2.20GHz\r\nProcessor Speed: 2195 MHz\r\nProcessor Graphics in Use: Intel(R) HD Graphics 5500\r\nShader Version: 5.0\r\nOpenGL* Version: 4.4\r\nOpenCL* Version: 2.0\r\n\r\n* Microsoft DirectX* *\r\nRuntime Version: 12.0\r\nHardware-Supported Version: 11.1\r\n\r\n* Built-in Display *\r\n\r\nDisplay Type: Digital\r\nDDC2 Protocol: Supported\r\nGamma: 2.2\r\nConnector Type: Embedded DisplayPort\r\nDevice Type: Built-in Display\r\n\r\nMaximum Image Size\r\nHorizontal Size: 13.39 inches\r\nVertical Size: 7.48 inches\r\n\r\nSupported Modes\r\n1366 x 768 (60p Hz)\r\n1366 x 768 (48p Hz)","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-26T17:29:44.936+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A recent update to Windows 10 made a change to the [Xbox Game Bar ](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html) bar that has been causing issues like this for some players.
