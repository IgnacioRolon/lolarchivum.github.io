It may not have seemed like it, but leaving your 4 other teammates could have been the deciding factor in why they lost. \n\nSince a losing game can always be turned around, you will still get hit with LPQ after leaving multiple matches. In the future, try to remember that you always have a fighting chance. By leaving your team you're only helping the other team win.","replies":[{"poster":"keenard","date":"2017-04-11T01:05:26.322+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ok thank you","replies":[]},{"poster":"ShaolinToilet","date":"2017-03-18T02:20:24.444+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why do I get so many trolls who when the team declines to surrender they just go afk farm or walk around","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Maddmazz","date":"2017-03-18T05:28:10.990+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why did you leave with only 1 minute left?","replies":[]}]}
