When shrooming in jungles place then next to jungle camps as it will cause the camp to agro them and they will take considerable more damage (gromp hits pretty hard).\r\n2. Teemo is at his best when he is split pushing but if you need to team fight hurricane is a must purchase. You will be able to focus a front liner while still hitting squishier target even if they are out of your auto range.\r\n3. Teemo scales better with pen early than AP. Sorc boots and spooky mask (Haunting Guise) are very good first items\r\n4. Even if you go top lane don&#039;t take TP just don&#039;t if the enemy team is smart they will know where you will be and blow you up\r\n5. This is a big one. MAKE USE OF YOUR PASSIVE. I have made so many kills camping a spot where I knew they enemy would walk into me. The attk speed buff is great for quickly bursting down a  wandering squishy also if you can stealth before a fight you can quickly surprise the enemy.\r\n\r\nJust a few tips for my fellow evil doers ill answer any question if you have em. Keep calm and let the enemy rage on.","replies":[{"poster":"Cindikle","date":"2015-07-12T17:43:03.214+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"But with TP I can go bot lane, plant 3 shrooms, then port top lane after the jungler is sick of trying to tank through my forest. \n\nJust think of the rage.","replies":[{"poster":"Pupel","date":"2015-07-12T17:46:03.415+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Cindikle,realm=NA,application-id=WEuoGbmp,discussion-id=22hyAEH2,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-07-12T17:43:03.214+0000)\n>\n> But with TP I can go bot lane, plant 3 shrooms, then port top lane after the jungler is sick of trying to tank through my forest. \n> \n> Just think of the rage.\n\ntbh I would be pissed as a jungler if I found teemo shrooms in the bot lane","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rew711","date":"2015-07-12T21:10:11.245+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I play Teemo ADC.

When shrooming don't just go for the bushes. The shrooms are invisible so they don't need to be there. Just put them where people are going to walk, If they walk in the bush THEN put it in the bush, but don't beeline straight for it. put some thought into it.\n2. Don't be afraid of ad/onhit builds. I prefer playing ad teemo at least against the tanky top lane threats. If i'm against someone who is squishier then ap will usually work better.
