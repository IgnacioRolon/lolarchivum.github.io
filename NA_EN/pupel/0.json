I can accept getting beat to death if she wails on me in her ult. i can accept getting out shoved. i can take getting poked out if she lands her stuff what i cant take is when he sucks out my soul and does 60-70% of my hp. Now i could fight her but then i am just taking 150%-170% dammage from every tentecal that hits me and if it is more than 1 i prolly be one shot. If i dont fight her she just chunks me out for free. So i would suggest that she does only like half or a third of the echoed dammage if she hits both you and the spirit","replies":[{"poster":"Quepha","date":"2016-06-13T18:24:54.131+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Either fight her in a way that her slams can't hit you and the spirit at the same time or back off and become a vessel before she can get much damage on you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2016-06-13T18:10:21.045+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">  i can take getting poked out if she lands her stuff\n\nOk so she landed e, a pretty slow skill shot which can be blocked by minions.  You should be fine with the poke if she lands her skills right? It does nowhere near that much damage early game and late game when it gets close to 65-70% then its late game where it should be doing that much dmg.","replies":[]}]}
