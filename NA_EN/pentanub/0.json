I tried deleting rads stuff, and doing a fresh install of league currently. If this does not work what is my next step to take?\n\nThe issue is black screen after champ select when it loads you into the game. I do not see any of the picks, but get the noise of being sent to the fields of justice.\n\nSolution brought to you by Kazuto Ishin (so you don't have to scroll):\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Kazuto Ishin,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=MbIHEeV9,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2016-05-28T01:15:01.243+0000)\n>\n> okay so i actually had the same bug in the past and it seems like it's finally stopped happening, what you want to do is if you have intel, go to their website and download their updater tool, once you have it open it as admin and search for updates, select those updates and hit yes to anything that pops up from it. after you do that and install it, DO NOT RESTART YOUR COMPUTER after the install. \n> \n> next you go to your settings and click on updates and let it download any updates it has and click it a few times to make sure it has checked properly. once you do that head to a custom game and try out league, it should work perfectly.\n> \n> i had been in contact with riot support about the exact same issue and it was never resolved. after messing around with my computer and updating stuff i finally found that fix. for whatever reason everytime my computer restarted all the updates were lost and i had to reinstall them in the same order. but finally it seems i can restart my computer and just head into a game without having to update.\n> \n> 100% guarantee this.\n> \n> Edit: do not ever restart you computer after doing the updates through both programs. if it is turned off or you chose to restart it to update something else you must repeat the process of updating Intel Then Windows\n\nI did restart mine and it worked (must have just gotten lucky) but this DID fix it!","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-05-26T20:38:23.926+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Given that you can't see anything, but can still hear the game being played, it sounds like you are able to connect to the individual game server, but your computer isn't able to render any of the information to appear on your screen.  The root cause of this may very well be Windows 10 and certain hardware not getting the proper software updates.  In an effort to resolve this, make sure to complete all of the steps in our [Game Crash Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974).  There are a lot of steps there, but they should hopefully get League to appear normally so you can get back onto the Rift.\n\nFeel free to reply back and let me know if your problem still exists!","replies":[{"poster":"PentaNub","date":"2016-05-27T16:17:05.975+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have done most of the steps except for downloading net3.5 I get it to download fine, and get it to pop up and say \"Are you sure you want to install this\" you know the usual, but it never installs. \n\nNow does league run in compatibility mode? If so I may tinker with that as well.\n\nEDIT: Alright, figured out what's going on. The sad part is I do not have a solution.\n\nSteps I took to fix my game: Listed above in your Crash Guide plus some of my own tinkering:\n\nMade it admin\nRan it in compatibility mode for windows 8\nand checked disable high DPI and the choice under it.\nAlso clicked run: maximized.\n\nGot into a game, started swapping settings around. Now it is running, but everything is zoomed in, so I set the right pixels, run it in full screen and BAM! Black screen once it loaded.\n\nSo I now know that it is full screen mode screwing me up, is there any way to undo that?","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-05-27T22:53:42.272+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can change your in-game settings by going into the actual game.cfg file in the installation.

Thank you so much!\n\nEDIT: The map is off screen sadly in boarderless. Guna mess around see what I can find\n\nEDIT 2: It is for sure full screen mode.
