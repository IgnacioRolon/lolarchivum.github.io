It's CONSTANTLY crashing and it never crashed as much before they made the new client. Am I just making false claims or have they really stopped updating the legacy?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-03-27T02:16:18.530+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rest assured that we are currently still taking care of the legacy client on NA when it comes to updates/patches/and such. If you feel like you've been getting more and more crashes over time, let me know what kind of errors you see and I can do my best to help fix what is causing it ^_^!","replies":[{"poster":"Conical Hats","date":"2017-04-02T21:41:44.752+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just got back from ANOTHER crash...I honestly find that really hard to believe and I feel like i'm not the only one here with this issue because I have friends who have told me the same thing.{{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}}","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-02T21:46:05.427+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What kinds of errors are you seeing? Saying your game crashed isn't very descriptive so I don't have much to go on to help. Check out our [**Bug Splat Guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974) in the meantime, and if that doesn't help let me know what happens when your game crashes.","replies":[{"poster":"Conical Hats","date":"2017-04-02T23:52:34.493+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll alt tab in lobby then my client will just stop working and i'm forced to close it.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-03T01:28:31.372+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So it sounds like what's happening is whenever you alt+tab the client becomes unresponsive. If that's the case, this is probably more of a driver or hardware issue than an actual crash. I'd still suggest looking over that Bug Splat guide, but if that didn't help go ahead and reach out to us in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) so that our tech guys can dig a little deeper!","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Kitty Bento Box","date":"2017-03-27T04:54:45.049+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yo, wtf.
