Is this some sick joke in the part or riot? Why is that there is even a report option? This game will never change how online gaming is there will always be people talking thrash what this game is implementing is the bad kids have all the right to play like shit without no consequences like why should I suffer or any good player by that matter. This whole system is a stupid way of allowing little children mentality people to get away with ruining a game. There is no logic in this r%%%%%ed system, reward the players that suck and don't take the game serious, and punish the players that try hard and don't like losing. Its like every game now in days Only and I MEAN only CARES about their casual players. I have to literally run it down whatever lane I am and feed the other team just to even feed like they are doing. I am sick of this bs why cant riot fix the ability for this banning bs. I know I am not the greatest player and not everyone wins every game, I get that everyone has a bad game every now an then. But why am I being punished for other peoples mistakes. I played this game since the beta but got almost everysingle one of my accounts banned because you cant tell anyone what they are doing wrong. I don't care how I go about and say it, that shouldn't be the problem. I stopped playing this game for 3 years only to come back and realize that it is at a worse stage than when I left. Now you cant even tell a supp laner to not take the kill. The game has changed so much that it is literally a different game its not league of legends anymore. We might as well call it the league of pussies, quick to call wolf and report someone. I hope this game loses its players and I mean good players and keeps all these oh I just play for fun on a \" normal game \" why cant we make a social playlist just to fix this bs. All the people that don't want to play to win go on that playlist and leave ranked and \"normals\" to the people that actually want to win. This will always be the only online game where the player that sucks has more say than a player that dedicates almost all day on winning games. Getting their stats up trying to get a s with every champion. Please if any good player that has this bs happened to him plz let this post be herd and spreads around. I am a competitive player and all competitive players hate losing its sickening what riot is trying to do. THEY WONT CHANGE ONLINE GAMING NO GAME WILL EVER GET RID OF SOME THRASH TALKING ITS MAKES A COMPETITIVE GAME THE WAY IT IS.  When a good player better than myself tells me what I am doing wrong I listen to him cuz I have logic implemented in my brain something the devs at riot don't know a thing about. I love this game but hate the cry baby \" oh you cant say that I suck, stop being toxic, or some bs like just play the game. NO how can I play the game when I am so irritated at the game that if I keep trying to quit they all still report even when I have chat restriction I watch what I say. AND still get reported for trying to ff when I know we lost the game no matter what we do. I am on this rant cuz I love this game so much I am addicted to it. But I hate this community so much that it literally downplays every good thing about this game. I m sick of It, appreciate your loyal players the ones that are actually trying to improve and not just playing it for shits and giggles. FOR FUCKS SAKES LEARN HOW TO CARE ABOUT YOUR COMPETIVE PLAYERS. And don't try to say go to ranked cuz the players im talking about are mainly on there. Not one player since I started playing again have I seen care about winning to the point where they try their hardest everyone always give 20% while im over here giving 10000000% of my effort to win and get better. FUCKING FIX YOUR GAME RIOT stop punishing me for calling a ace a ace. What logic is it when you throw away someones ability to use logic ???? I hope everyone that plays this game competitively leaves the game and leaves you with those trolling idiots","replies":[]}
