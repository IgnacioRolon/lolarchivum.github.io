I am not sure if anyone else feels the same but I would think an option to change the cursor size would not only be helpful for those like myself that feel it is too small but also anyone who feels that it is too large. Please RIOT add a slider to change the cursor size in game.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-30T18:37:44.062+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"4K is not currently supported so you can run into issues like this, especially if you task in and out often.  You may need to change your resolution to something smaller in-game and screen.  I hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
