So I was recently diagnosed with a debilitating disease a few months ago. It has left me wheelchair bound and jobless since I can no longer stand and be a baker. Im going to start streaming to raise awareness for POTS, I thought it would be really cool to enjoy my favorite hobby and to raise awareness so more people will understand more about this Chronic illness and find a cure one day. Once I get the money to build a better computer I will start streaming. It will take me awhile since I no longer have a job but its the one dream I have left that I can do.\n\nFor those who wish to donate and help me out here's a link gofundme.com/lmp8oc\n\nHere is a link to my twitch I hope it works. twitch.tv/xbabycakessx","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Sweet","date":"2015-02-05T21:55:27.797+0000","up_votes":63,"down_votes":1,"body":"Extremely sorry to hear about your recent diagnosis.

Of those who responded to the survey, 18.2% reported a complete resolution of their POTS symptoms, while 52.8% reported persistent but improved symptoms. Male patients were twice as likely to report recovery. The average survey respondent had been diagnosed for about 5 years. Both patients who fully recovered and those who did not had mental health scores similar to the national norm. \"*\nhttp://www.dysautonomiainternational.org/page.php?ID=30\nIt also discusses treatment, not sure what your doc may have recommended.

I don't really have anything off the top of my head to recommend other then trying to see several different doctors to get a number of different perspectives on the issue. So many times I have heard that a condition was made worse or not properly treated because of a given doctor. Hopefully your situation, indeed, gets better with time. Perhaps in a few years something would come to light on how to better treat/diagnose pots. It is definitely worth doing some research into specifics on your disease as there may be key links seeing vital research and discoveries that could help such as immune related issues (example: studies of young blood transferred into older systems possibly yielding benefits to the immune system).","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"gubigubi","date":"2015-02-05T22:59:48.005+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good luck! and really awesome cosplay :D!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Leafie","date":"2015-02-06T17:01:31.059+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're an incredibly strong and obviously beautiful girl.

That causes my heart to work extra hard so my heart rate can go to 130+ beats. With prolonged standing (5 minutes) it causes me to faint and my heart to stop for a few seconds. There are plenty of other symptoms that are very frustrating such as extreme fatigue, sleeping problems, shortness of breath, memory loss, and many many more.
