He's in heavy armor! He's the first of the Undead! He can steal his enemy's souls! He's Magneto!). \n\nNow while all of that is pretty cool, we felt that having so much going on made him a little bit confused as a character.\n\nLooking at him more closely, it was the metal-mage stuff that didn't really seem to fit cohesively with everything else, or fit his background. Also, we made a move away from the metal-mage aspect in his visual effects recently, and as such, his \"Master of Metal\" title just didn't really seem to fit so well any more. We kept the metal references in his spells, though (which, as a metal fan myself, makes me happy).\n\nIn his longer bio (which will be released soon!) we've delved a little into who Mordekaiser was before he became the undying revenant we all know and love. Having explored his background a little more than we have previously, we figured the \"Lord of Death\" was a pretty fitting title for him. \n\nHope that gives a little insight into this change!\n\nCheers!\nAnt","replies":[{"poster":"ShÃ­ny","date":"2015-10-14T23:56:18.283+0000","up_votes":193,"down_votes":4,"body":"Mostly the problem is that lord of death is an extremely bland and redundant title ; making him basically Mordekaiser: The Mordekaiser.\nIs there a possibility you could reconsider and change the title for something that's still in line with his new identity but also has some more flair to it?","replies":[{"poster":"HayRoss","date":"2015-10-15T00:47:02.758+0000","up_votes":102,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mordekaiser: The Mordekaiser sounds like what Draven's title should be like:\n\n\nDraven: The Draven","replies":[{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-10-15T01:04:07.648+0000","up_votes":47,"down_votes":1,"body":"Woah, woah, woah.
