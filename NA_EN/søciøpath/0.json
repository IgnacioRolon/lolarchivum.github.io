Now I may be good enough to play against golds which I'm not worried about but it is the plats and diamonds that piss me off. I'm silver 4 (Not A Smurf) with a silver 4 mmr but I guess that doesn't matter.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-22T03:38:16.197+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Normal games aren't going to build teams purely based on ranked tier, since they aren't ranked games. Your MMR is taken into account, so if you're playing with plat ranked players that means your MMR is actually similar, or the overall 'team mmr' is balanced between the teams. If you want to only play with people close to your rank, the ranked queues would be best (when the next season starts).","replies":[]}]}
