People don&#039;t like her I get it, however I read that one of these planned nerfs is to get rid of Sleepy Trouble Bubbles &#039;trap on the ground&#039;. I personally really enjoy the aesthetic look of the sleepy trouble bubbles &#039;trap&#039; especially in the pool party skin, in fact that&#039;s what sold it for me. If I knew this was gonna happen I would have never bought the pool party Zoe skin let alone the chroma pack with it.","replies":[]}
