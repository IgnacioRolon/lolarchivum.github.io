I suggest testing a wired connection to rule out possibilities with your wifi, otherwise the steps in our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide should help with troubleshooting.  I recommend testing it out in a custom game, though, to prevent leaverbuster penalties.","replies":[{"poster":"i never asked","date":"2017-10-07T18:10:58.399+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hey porocles after my match was finished, which i could reconnect back into, i now how leaver buster. im really upset now","replies":[]}]}]}
