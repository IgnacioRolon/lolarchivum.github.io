Idc if she's op, I'm saying that Riven is super annoying.\n\nEDIT: Imo, Riven is harder to deal with. Any good Riven will usually get a bit tanky, which means you can't burst her because they normally get around 3.5-4k effective health (Includes shield), and deal a good deal of damage. I'm not saying Ahri is easy to deal with, cause she isn't, just that Riven, for me, is harder to fight.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Jungle Lux God","date":"2015-07-17T00:16:34.501+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are two problems with this.\n\nThe first is that Riven was un-disabled.\n\nThe second is that ranked was disabled.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hydra706","date":"2015-07-16T19:23:02.975+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's finally sunny in league.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Frikgeek","date":"2015-07-16T10:27:32.046+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Spam ranked you say?
