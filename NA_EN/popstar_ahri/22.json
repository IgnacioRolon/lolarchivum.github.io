If she's getting LCS love, it's not because she's powerful, especially since her spears have a 60 radius. I think Teemo's hit box is bigger than her spear's hit box. lol. AD works pretty well, though. Not so Spear reliant since you'll have the damage outside of Cougar form with your AA's, Trinity Force to let you get close and stay close. AP Nid just chucks long-range spears and prays that one isn't dodged. AP Nid also only has form of damage from a range and has to hit it to be able to get close enough with her cougar form, plus if she's healing, she's running out of mana fast... etc. etc.She's not bad, but she's not all too strong. Her popularity is just that 'time'. All champs get those random boosts in popularity for almost no reason or because some one decided to use it. We can look at AD Malzahar, AD Bruiser LeBlanc, etc. It's likely just a phase.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fraggleroc","date":"2015-02-09T06:27:59.912+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1 word: Mobility and Burst","replies":[]}]}
