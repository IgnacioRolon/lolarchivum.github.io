(Before Reset)","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I played all day yesteray...From 7:00 AM Central (Nov 7) to 2:00 AM Central (Nov 8). I was at 2 Wins - 2 Losses and my 5th game got into champ select a little after midnight central time. Game started at probably 12:05 CST. I ended up winning the game and got gold 5!!! \r\n\r\n...But my question is: Did I make it in time to get the season 6 rewards? My profile shows that I'm in Gold 5, but when i go to sites like op.gg it says: \r\nSeason 6 Silver 1 100LP. Did it reset in PST time? If so then I should get the Gold rewards for season 6 right? 12AM for me in Central time was 2AM PST. So I should've had til 2 AM if they were going by PST.\r\n\r\nI won 15 games out 19 i think yesterday and worked so hard to get Gold. It'd seem so wrong if i didn't get the rewards if I only missed a game by a few minutes. If anyone could please clarify this for me, I would greatly appreciate it!!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-08T18:11:39.851+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Placing on the last day is really risky, but we did try to give as much advance notice possible including a [countdown ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/230496748)timer and information on [disabling ranked](http://status.leagueoflegends.com/#na).  We don't support third party sites, so the information they're showing may be inaccurate and out of date.  If you are out of Champ Select by 23:59 in your local server time, this will be the last game to count towards your rewards.

When Porocles mentioned the local server time, they were talking about the time that the season ends for everyone on the server, regardless of the time zone you actually live in.\n\nFor NA, the local server time is in PST, which means that you need to have been out of champion select and in the loading screen by 11:59 PM PST for the game to count. CST is 2 hours ahead of PST, so if you got out of champion select at around 12:06 AM CST, that would be 10:06 pm PST, which is in the timeframe you needed to meet, so the game would count.\n\nThis means you should eligible for the gold rewards.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rivuo","date":"2016-11-08T18:37:25.181+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Jocklich,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=Zlaeen1V,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2016-11-08T18:31:35.366+0000)\n>\n> Ugh i wasn&#x27;t out of champ select by 11:59.
