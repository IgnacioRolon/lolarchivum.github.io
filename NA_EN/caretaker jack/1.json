Of course, Bard is mysterious, so I understand Riot not wanting to give too much away.... But, at least, the mountain should be around Ionia's outskirts somewhere.","replies":[{"poster":"Naalith","date":"2018-07-25T01:07:05.886+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hope Bard appears in a cameo in some other stories sometime in the near future. There is a leaked Syndra story going around the internet and while I won't give the entire story away, I will say that a fairly major character left out of the new canon makes her perfect first appearance, it's basically the equivalent of a post-credit scene and it's awesome.

The Noxians threaten the unknowable structure of the universe by getting their hands on that stone the Old man failed to protect...
