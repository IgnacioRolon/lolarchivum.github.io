It causes them to rage at people for reasons that make sense to them, but aren't actually true. Furthermore, they aren't able to differentiate if what they're saying even applies to their situation. \r\n\r\n**Why is High Elo Cancer? **\r\n\r\nThe short answer is knowledge, but this is where it gets interesting because you would think that knowing more about what you're doing and being better at the game would make you less frustrated. But, apparently, it actually does the opposite. In other words, higher elo players actually end up being cancerous because they've acquired all this knowledge to the point where some of the things we don't do is, basically, common sense to them. Could you imagine having to lose perfectly winnable games just because your ally doesn't understand things that you would consider common sense? \r\n\r\n**The Fun Part**\r\n\r\nIt's time to vote! Lets see what the masses think and if you're feeling brave, I encourage you to give me your opinions and tell me what you all think about the subject. Maybe we could kick off the subject by defining High and Low Elo.","replies":[{"poster":"MYSTlCFLOW","date":"2018-08-31T05:11:12.544+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"definitely high elo,  because as a plat-diamond player I can go into bronze/silver/gold and literally not have to worry at all about what my team mates do, (when I'm playing top, tryndamere, jax, yi) I just split push and automatically win,  communicating with a team isn't even necessary, it's actually 1v5 and I win when I split push\n\nmeanwhile high elo, I have to deal with losing lane and team mates who accurately point out flaws","replies":[]},{"poster":"LetMeCarry1983","date":"2018-08-31T01:13:04.476+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Silver is probably the most toxic elo.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2018-08-30T16:49:44.145+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are pockets of heavy toxicity.\n\nLow level <25, bronze5, plat5 and diamond5.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Voldymort","date":"2018-08-30T16:26:48.163+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"High elo.
