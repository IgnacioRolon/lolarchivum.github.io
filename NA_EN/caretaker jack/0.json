If Nocturne and Rek'sai are more natural alien forms of these metallic monsters then Cassiopeia was imagined more like a 'Queen' form, or alternatively a hybrid created to communicate with the Humans this alien race has now encountered and warred against. Either way she has a more relatable mind and appearance, although at this very moment I am watching Species 2 and wondering if it's just another alien trick to kill us all.","replies":[{"poster":"Hovering Hentai","date":"2017-12-18T13:44:06.787+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"On the side note of Phyrexia - was any of Lissandra's design based off Elesh Norn from New Phyrexia?

They've been creating amazing and original worlds and characters for over 25 years and it's hard to pitch any idea without the 'Simpsons Did It' effect, except it's 'MtG Did It!'. Clestial gods? Theros. Otherworldly corruption? Eldrazi. Machine-monsters? Phyrexia. There are expansions inspired by almost every region and culture of our history and stories featuring every kind of imaginable character archetype, magics and races. I think MtG, Warcraft and Warhammer 40k are the three most expansive and awesome universes in modern gamer-culture.","replies":[{"poster":"Hovering Hentai","date":"2017-12-18T20:04:44.513+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're going to have to add league into that list :D A world where a star forging dragon and a woman with a snazzy rifle can both be equally relevant","replies":[{"poster":"Kindlejack","date":"2017-12-18T22:32:51.633+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey it's pretty darn snazzy :P","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Kindlejack","date":"2017-12-18T19:32:56.503+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That was before my time, but I know [Trevor Claxton](https://www.artstation.com/trevor) worked on the concept and he is known for a lot of abstract sci fi design.
