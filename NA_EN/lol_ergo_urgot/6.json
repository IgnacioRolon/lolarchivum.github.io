I used foolish words and speculations when I saw teasers in lieu of staying my tongue and waiting for the whole product to be revealed. I need to learn patience in this area, and if any disagreements are to be had, I shall try my best to articulate my concerns- as my finer gentry have flawlessly done. \r\n\r\nI needed time to rectify my vision with your vision of Yorick. And I see the wisdom in what you did. There are some unique elements I feel were lost, but on the whole this is a much better product.\r\n\r\nI feel his voice over is fantastic. The login theme is dark, brooding, atmospheric, and daunting. I also feel the Undertaker skin was given a lot of personality and care which keeps alive the pure grave digger aspects. \r\n\r\nI am certainly considering putting the time into this new Yorick, and if I can make it work, I will replace him as my main {{champion:6}} . \r\n\r\nI once again apologize.","replies":[{"poster":"Beyond Legends","date":"2016-08-28T17:55:46.264+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":0,"body":"Who are you?","replies":[{"poster":"LoL Ergo Urgot","date":"2016-08-28T20:08:31.048+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"A dick.","replies":[{"poster":"WolfChases","date":"2016-08-28T21:56:48.958+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello Dick how are you?","replies":[{"poster":"LoL Ergo Urgot","date":"2016-08-28T22:00:11.584+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"http://nationalvanguard.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Richard-Nixon-at-press-conference_crop.jpg","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Beyond Legends","date":"2016-08-28T20:41:31.176+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Richard?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Melledoneus","date":"2016-08-28T20:34:47.796+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Beyond Legends,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=n63OsZcb,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-08-28T17:55:46.264+0000)\n>\n> Who are you?\n\nHe's just a hero for fun.","replies":[{"poster":"GaleWinUnleashed","date":"2016-08-29T15:31:27.952+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Brb, watching Boros fight again.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"BurnSnake","date":"2016-08-29T02:53:08.705+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"One of my big problems is that his lore is basically {{champion:110}} .

I think this is the weakest point of his VGU, my eyes literally start dropping when his low, soothing voice over starts. \n\nI also think he is boring. He has a very monotonous playstyle of spam q, and his w/e feel very lackluster. While his Q is really fucking strong, thats his only offensive spell really. \n\nHe has a slow paced farm heavy, q spam playstyle like Nasus. However Nasus has moments of exciting gameplay, ie when he ghosts after enemies or ults and 1 v 5s the enemy. Yorick doesnt have any redeeming/ fun moments in his gameplay.\n\nI'm sure some players will enjoy his zen/ monotonous playstyle, but he isnt much fun for me\n\nJust my two cents !","replies":[]},{"poster":"LoL Ergo Urgot","date":"2016-08-28T21:51:15.234+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"http://theadultsideofdisney.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Nixon-Mickey.jpg","replies":[]}]}
