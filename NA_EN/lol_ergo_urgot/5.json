But some thoughts.\r\n\r\nYou know what has always jammed my acid hunters? A Nasus, who rushes frozen heart, then begins to out sustain me, as I watch my mana supply dwindle and his health remain the same. Chogath, Mundo (smart ones anyway), Malphite, ect. \r\n\r\nEssentially, any tank, who builds tanky, with sustain (not necessary but a plus), will counter Urgot in lane. By the time I can get a last whisper, I have to shell in for some essentials: boots, tear, brutilizer, I can&#039;t rush that like they can rush armor. \r\n\r\nBut wait, the tank meta is back and they are strong now? What?!?! \r\n\r\nAlso, just to say this, Nocturne can be tough cookie too. His spell shield and fear is is able to disrupt the eqqq, and his stickiness can be a problem as well.\r\n\r\nNow, if you want to rework Urgot&#039;s kit because you think there are cool things you can do with him, that there is a role which you want him to fill (for your quest of making every champion unique), or if there is some greater higher thingy that you have planned, by all means rework his kit, but not for sake that he lacks counter play. \r\n\r\nI mean. let&#039;s not forget that he already tends to shove lanes, be susceptible to ganks, and has low mobility . \r\n\r\nI am silver, so what do I know?\r\n\r\nTLDR: Is Urgot still going to have a kit reowrk?","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2015-04-06T00:25:26.372+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":4,"body":"We're still planning to rework him.

Urgot would be less of a lane bully with Cass's range, sure, but he'd still be a 100% binary champion and that is exactly what Cassiopeia is right now.\n\nYou guys need to seriously get some consistency with your champ design values, because being binary should not be a reason to rework one champion but a design goal in another.","replies":[{"poster":"Constable Bunu","date":"2015-04-06T18:04:55.798+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Cass has to put herself in greater danger than Urgot to do significant damage. Urgot can also efficiently build both defensive and offensive stats and still do crap tons of damage to squishies and tanks. Cass doesn't have the luxury of having convenient defensive itemization. The most you could get is Rylai's, Zhonya's, ROA, or Abyssal Scepter/Void Staff (I can never remember which is which, I'm trying to refer to the item that gives AP and MR with the MR reduction passive). All of these are tanky options, but nowhere near as tanky as Urgot can and should be.\n\nFurthermore, Cass' kit is much more coherent and well defined. She is a short range sustained damage mage, like Ryze. She does more damage than Ryze but is less tanky. Her ult is self peel and she has a little cc and mobility in her kit (MS boost on Q, slow on W). Urgot has no proper comparisons except Cass. Urgot has a permaslow that is dependent on his shield holding (reason Skarner was nerfed, I mean reworked). He has a long range point and click ability that does absurd damage to squishies with few damage items. His ultimate is counter-intuitive to the rest of his kit. Everything else has decent to long range, but his ultimate requires him to be really close to the enemy.\n\nCassiopeia has well defined strengths and weaknesses, has a defined power curve, and a cohesive kit. Nothing in her kit screams abuse case. Cass is stronger than most champs in lane pre-6, but loses power once laning is over. She doesn't really become strong again until 3-4 completed items. She is a hyper carry, the magic damage version of Caitlyn or Tristana. To speak more toward the Urgot comparison, she puts herself in danger to output her damage. She can throw out poison from range, sure, but a lot of champs have AoE abilities with decent range. Not only that, she isn't reliant on one ability to set up her poison, she has 2 abilities for that. Beyond even that, having poison on a target does not change the function of Twin Fangs, it just comes off of cooldown much faster. Binary gameplay is not bad by itself, it's when a champ is either useless or OP as hell based on one skillshot that makes them toxic. Cass does not become OP as hell when she lands poison. She becomes strong, yes, but she still has all the same issues as other immobile mages like Brand (a champion who doesn't scale as well and has just as conjunctional gameplay, though not binary).\n\nUrgot has situational strengths and weaknesses. In lane, he is strong if you hit the Corrosive Charge since you can then spam Acid Hunters at your opponent. This is true at any stage of the game. Corrosive Charge hit means tons of damage. The reason Urgot is being reworked is because his kit is very disfunctional. If you hit your E and your W shield is holding, you have a single target permaslow with greater range than Caitlyn's AA's, not to mention it's SINGLE TARGET POINT AND CLICK WITH GREATER RANGE THAN CAITLYN (and Kog'Maw). Single target abilities have lower ranges because they don't miss. The fact that hitting an ability changes the baseline functionality of one of your abilities and makes it objectively broken and overpowered is why it's both binary and toxic. This is the reason Ryze was nerfed like he was.\n\nTL;DR Urgot is binary and toxic because his kit fundamentally changes and becomes objectively overpowered when he hits one skillshot and his ultimate contradicts the rest of his kit. Cass is binary and NOT toxic because she her kit is cohesive and fair. She does not fundamentally change as a champion when a single ability hits, she only becomes better at the same thing.","replies":[{"poster":"Terff","date":"2015-04-07T02:50:08.304+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To me the thing that makes cass toxic is her passive imo, it has awkward power spikes and can turn her from being behind to far ahead and is very un-interactive.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheFrozenIsles","date":"2015-04-06T20:43:16.257+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well said.\n\nJust a few thing I what to add to this as well.
