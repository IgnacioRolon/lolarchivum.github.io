I have always tried my best to respect the rules but as we all know that does not always go to plan.  The main thing i want to know is, can a perma ban be undone if i can somehow prove that it wasnt me though ip address  or something. I was guttered to log in to find all that time and grinding was for nothing. It appears the ban was for a number of things said . Dont get me wrong i have flamed many times but no where near to what was said leading upto the ban. If their is anyway or anything i can do to please let me know. -TheRacistBogan","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-27T05:00:05.432+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can't say for sure, but permabans do typically stick as you're responsible for what happens on your account. Even still, you're always more than welcome to shoot us a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) asking for clarification, and we can take a look to see when the offense that got you banned occurred.","replies":[]}]}
