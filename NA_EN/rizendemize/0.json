This happens when you look at other peoples profiles consecutively or in a fast manner.\n\nThis bug can be recreated using one of the following methods:\n\n• Using the Recently Played menu in your friends list, right clicking to view the profiles in order\n• Looking at other peoples profiles and switching back to your own quickly\n• Switching from one players profile to the next without going back to your own (sometimes it has to be done quickly)\n\nIt's a weird bug that stops you from viewing any profiles including your own, stops you from accessing rune pages, masteries and item sets.. You can still press the play button, join a game, go into the store and do all other non profile related things. If you do play a game however, after you get out of the game you still cannot access anything profile related.","replies":[]},{"poster":"kittypie","date":"2017-02-17T14:32:56.060+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i have the same problem please fix","replies":[]},{"poster":"Calypsó","date":"2017-01-03T14:34:01.218+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This bug has been a serious issue. 99% Riot won't address this issue unless someone of \"importance\" mentions it. {{item:3070}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"2Annies1ChaliceA","date":"2016-12-29T00:53:55.114+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They're like Steam, don't bother fixing the things that need fixing.
