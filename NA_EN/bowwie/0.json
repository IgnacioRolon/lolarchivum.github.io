You should be reporting for what you see as someone breaking the rules. You dont need to tell other people (especially on your team or to the enemy team) to report an AFK. Its obvious when someone is AFK and people should have the common sense to report when it does happen, so why do you need to state the obvious.\n\nThen there is the matter if you are lying. People lie in this game (as they do in real life) Ive seen a ton of people while playing this game lie that someone is afk when they are in lane, or waiting on X-amount of gold to get an item. it causes an unwanted negative environment and you are basically calling for a Witch-hunt/mob to get someone out when you can just do the right thing and just report them after the game since only one report is needed to trigger a review on someones account!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Trashlord Kayden","date":"2016-10-01T10:33:53.996+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"no. asking for people to report someone is viewed as harassment by the tribunal. if there is an afk, the enemy team more than likely notices it and will report the person after game without being asked.","replies":[]},{"poster":"EndlessSorcerer","date":"2016-10-01T18:58:45.003+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even if  if Leaverbuster wasn't enough to catch them, only one report is needed to trigger a review of the game.\n\nAsking for reports is just harassment; it is entirely pointless.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LordGeovanni","date":"2016-10-02T09:19:50.839+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No i just state that i will report them or some times not even state it jsut report them you dont tell other players how they should react to other players yet this is the same community that is not even personally but generally insulting you get banned too.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Zelnick","date":"2016-10-01T07:12:51.679+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":6,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Reket DeAlk,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=Q1t2eh65,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2016-10-01T06:23:46.254+0000)\n>\n> Calling for reports is punishable.\n\nNo it's not.
