And if he gets a VGU it'll be next year at the very earliest.","replies":[{"poster":"Fat Bastard GOD","date":"2016-02-21T01:24:19.985+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I don't think you are Meddler ;)","replies":[{"poster":"OneSmoothDude","date":"2016-02-21T08:41:59.869+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's true, he's not Meddler, but he's probably right all the same. There are bits and pieces that various Rioters have told us over the past month or so that leads us to think both of those are gonna be a no.\n\nA short while ago there was a thread where people working on re-doing some splash arts specified 3-5 champs that were at the top of their list (Trundle, Nidalee I think...can't remember the rest). Ryze wasn't among them. In that same thread they also said they're going to focus redoing splash arts on champs that are receiving game updates--which, Meddler said that Ryze isn't getting one of those. So while we can't rule that out 100%, it looks unlikely.\n\nAnd about the VGU, again, it's doubtful. The team has said that they're shying away from \"mid-tier\" updates (like Shen, Fiora, GP) in favor of more of the Sion-level updates. They've announced that Taric's coming before the mid-year mage update, and then Yorick will be after that, and they're optimistic about having another one fit inside 2016. Now, this _might_ be Ryze, but I wouldn't bet on it. There are other champs that are in a worse position than Ryze is currently, especially considering Meddler has said that they already have balance-sized changes for Ryze. He's probably hoping these will help put him into a decent spot so he doesn't need any more updates for awhile.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"ExecutorDill","date":"2016-02-22T01:25:03.343+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ahah9iF6,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-02-20T10:05:57.938+0000)\n>\n> No, we'll be working on Ryze, balance adjustments at the very least, sooner than that.\n\nWhat about TF meddler?  What's your take on his position? I don't like that he's countered by everone who has a gap closer and is easily shoved out of lane by other immobile champs like {{champion:99}} {{champion:134}} {{champion:45}}. I think he needs a bit of love.\n\nI'd like if he was better at \"Kiting\" seeing as he has to go extremelsy close to get to a  use his stun. Perhaps a small burst movespeed for landing his Q like ahri? Maybe do something cool with his E ability like give it 50 range (I know TF players will just try to use it with W but atleast it makes new players more aware of stacking E before going in as it feels like it doesn't do much early to mid game and isn't really noticeable).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"PhantomGG","date":"2016-02-20T09:50:42.011+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I doubt it considering he got a full rework just recently","replies":[{"poster":"Danjeng","date":"2016-02-20T20:40:10.723+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, but his kit was considered very toxic (permasnare has little counterplay), so they're at it again.

The 6.3 changes fix permasnare by simply allowing fewer spells during his passive, including fewer snares. Easy enough.\n\nThe 6.3 changes also decreased the skill gap by lowering how many spells he can throw out. With the maximum amount of spells normalized and no longer dependent on how mechanically skilled each player is, it will be much easier to balance him for all levels. \n\nI think this is why Meddler thinks Ryze will only need balance adjustments. 6.3 put him on the right path; now they can fine-tune his numbers and go from there.","replies":[{"poster":"Danjeng","date":"2016-02-22T21:40:19.190+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hear that they'll be moving back up the base damage on Overload. With the spell cap in place, I personally think they could revert the nerfs to Rune Prison's duration, since he can no longer permasnare (he can only bust out two Rune Prison's in a combo now, correct me if I'm wrong), along with the nerfs to spell flux.\n\nThis patch doesn't make him easier to play, but lowers his damage potential for those who are very skilled at him, which could be a step in the right direction. Some of the high level Ryze mains aren't happy with this however.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Nekusen","date":"2016-02-22T22:58:01.552+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As the champs i use aren't include in the major changes, i hope that the update at least includes new items.","replies":[]}]}
