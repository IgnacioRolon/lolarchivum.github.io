He is ready to hit back at about 15 minutes. I am so tired of people crying about how he's unfair to play against. Not every champion needs to go balls to the walls and start dueling 3 minutes into a game. Nasus is a champion who controls the pace of a lane which is a rare trait for a champ in the ever present true damage era, overloaded kits, and three hit passives.  Nasus excels fairly with his core fantasy. A slow building giant hyper threat. Like any champion he can be shut down and made ineffective. My point is not every champion needs to shape up like what is meta or flavor of the month. There is nothing wrong with a bit of simplicity.","replies":[]},{"poster":"weeaboomer","date":"2016-01-26T21:36:53.050+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":8,"body":"He should get reworked to be more fun to play against.","replies":[]}]}
