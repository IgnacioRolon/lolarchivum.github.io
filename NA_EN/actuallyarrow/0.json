I think we need more (because they look awesome). So I am going to base the League characters (mostly by looks) on who they would reference best. (Note, this is opinionated).\n\n{{champion:14}}  Would look amazing as Dian Wei. They both weild an axe, they are both bulky, and they are both bald (well, technically Sion is). The only difference is one is a zombie. Which, seeing as (spoilers, I guess?) Dian Wei dies protecting CaoCao, it could be referenced that it is Dian Wei reborn. \nhttp://fc08.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2013/363/e/5/8f7f5143fbf2b211c3d2c3a9cb8065380dd78e24_by_ladytuonela-d6zxlo6.png\n\n{{champion:50}} Would look amazing as Sima Yi. \nhttp://86bb71d19d3bcb79effc-d9e6924a0395cb1b5b9f03b7640d26eb.r91.cf1.rackcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/dynasty-warriors-8-sima-yi-artwork.jpg\n\n{{champion:77}} Would look amazing as Meng Huo. He is practically begging for a Meng Huo skin. \nhttps://quecosplayhago.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/54-meng_huo.png\n\n{{champion:157}} Another champion that is begging to be a Dynasty Warriors reference, Yasuo would look amazing as Zhou Tai. \nhttp://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/dynastywarriors/images/5/57/Zhou_Tai_-_Dynasty_Warriors_4.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130131010456\n\n{{champion:201}} would fit well as Cao Ren. Maybe not in personality, but Cao Ren is a wall, and so is Braum.\nhttp://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/dynastywarriors/images/5/50/Caoren-dw7.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20101217170021\n\n{{champion:24}} Now, I have no idea why this hasn&#039;t been thought up yet. But Jax would look amazing as Pang Tong. The two are practically identical to one another in looks.\nhttp://fc03.deviantart.net/fs5/i/2004/333/a/7/Pang_Tong_by_DW3Girl.jpg\n\nI could go on, but there are a ton of champs, and that would take a while to cover. These are just my top picks, but I could probably find one for every champ (well, the ones that look human-ish).\n\nEDIT: I had another one I couldn't help but tag onto this. \n\n{{champion:122}}  as Xu Huang.\nhttp://images4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20090413050854/dynastywarriors/images/a/a3/Xu_Huang.jpeg ","replies":[{"poster":"BlackSunNocturne","date":"2015-03-31T14:19:48.144+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreed.\n\nI want all of these","replies":[]},{"poster":"Academy Kayn","date":"2015-03-31T05:21:09.465+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:50}}  yeesssssss","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chespin2013","date":"2015-03-31T01:12:47.782+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"all of these need to happen esp the yasuo one","replies":[]},{"poster":"X8ViEhkPS0","date":"2015-03-30T21:35:16.897+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd like to see Dian Wei charging a full team with his chest full of arrows.","replies":[]},{"poster":"xxbrad2o12xx","date":"2015-03-30T21:25:25.997+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I posted almost a year ago on the old forums when yasuo was released that a warring kingdoms yasuo would be amazing as zhou tai also jax as pang tong omg yes dynasty warriors fans rejoice.","replies":[{"poster":"Rito Jericho","date":"2015-03-30T23:48:27.621+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=xxbrad2o12xx,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=AEEaoLW6,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-03-30T21:25:25.997+0000)\n>\n> I posted almost a year ago on the old forums when yasuo was released that a warring kingdoms yasuo would be amazing as zhou tai also jax as pang tong omg yes dynasty warriors fans rejoice.\n\nPersonally, as a fellow Dynasty Warriors fan, I simply must agree!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rito Jericho","date":"2015-04-01T18:46:08.022+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Now that I get a comparison image, yes.

I somehow failed to see Warring Kingdoms Tryn's resemblance to any Dynasty Warriors characters.\n\nHuh.  In all honesty, 6 was the very first Dynasty Warriors that I've ever played, so naturally I thought it was pretty good.
