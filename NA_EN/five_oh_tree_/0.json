They also cost less than current pink wards. \r\n\r\nDoes anyone know if a control ward will cancel out an enemy control ward and/or how that would work?\r\n\r\nDoesn&#039;t this indirectly nerf teemo and (may he rest in the dirt they seem to be nerfing him into) shaco rather hard? As teemo, a common strategy is to throw shrooms into a crowd of minions; even if they have vision of the shrooms from pink wards, the minions will still trigger them. If a team just lays out a few control wards, this will no longer work, and no one will have to take time to clear shaco boxes revealed. Can anyone tell me if they have a smaller radius or something to balance this buff out???\r\n\r\nThere&#039;s another effect of it disabling wards instead of just revealing them. If you&#039;re in lane and you have a stealth ward in a bush and they throw a control ward in it, you can&#039;t just walk over to it unless you have a substantial advantage over them. Now you can&#039;t see the river and have to either take huge risks or play at your turret, all because of a 50g item. Maybe I&#039;m overreacting, but if they don&#039;t even have to clear your wards to stop your vision, a control ward will cement your lead and make sure they never know if they&#039;re going to get tower dived by you and your jungler.\r\n\r\nThoughts, anyone? People with PBE accounts especially welcome.","replies":[{"poster":"Tenth Leper","date":"2016-10-27T08:51:42.015+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"They do seem really powerful and do effect certain champions more than others, but I think they will be an entertaining turn in the vision wars.

(Namely, if the enemy placed a ward in the baron pit, you would effectively have to sweep the pit to ensure the enemy can't track Baron's health. and even when you had a pink, you would still have to destroy the enemy ward.) \n\nI remember when Riot first introduced trinkets. And in the pro scene, vision war was like trench warfare, because of how easily players had access to vision. Riot seems to be counter pushing that with increases in vision denial. And with the removal of raptor buff, they needed another way to deny vision.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Fondling Gems","date":"2016-10-27T09:02:38.819+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Control wards only reveal camouflage, not invisibility, and both Teemo and Shaco abilities are invis.  IDK about them disabling other control wards though.  I would assume not, but who knows... Other than PBE players I guess... oh and Rioters... Hmm, guess a lot of people know that.","replies":[{"poster":"five oh tree ","date":"2016-10-27T09:10:39.994+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Both teemo's shrooms and shaco's boxes are counted as hidden traps, unless they were just recently changed. Control wards disable hidden traps. Those were the abilities I was talking about.","replies":[{"poster":"Fondling Gems","date":"2016-10-27T09:19:06.834+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think that realistically it isn't going to have a massive impact other than being a bit cheaper than the current pink wards.  Currently if you are in a position where the enemy is willing to fight you on your terms then you probably shouldn't be putting a pink in a bush like that anyways.  Currently the most common placer of pinks, the support, can already do this anyways with Red trinket.  \n\nI think it might have a bit of an impact on Ranged champions, who actually have to move into the bush to take it out, but for many I don't think it will be a massive issue since any time where you were confident enough to clear out a pink ward is almost always going to be you being confident to clear out a control ward, with the only difference being you have to walk into the bush to attack the control ward.  \n\nIt may very well also have the effect of still showing the control ward, but denying all other vision for all we know.  \n\nHonestly though, I think pulling same ward clearing power away from ranged champs will actually be very beneficial to the game health.  The biggest part is that it would let melees hide in a bush top lane and make ranged opponents have to actually get close if they want to clear it, which would help curb the power from ranged top laners.\n\nIn any case, I think it is a bit too early to be freaking out, we should let things flow and see how it turns out since we can't playtest on the pbe.","replies":[{"poster":"five oh tree ","date":"2016-10-27T09:28:15.283+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with a lot of that insight. However, in top lane let's say you have jayce vs. darius. If darius has to either 1. walk to the bush or 2. just let his lane be frozen indefinitely because jayce made a 50g purchase, that's a problem. If he actually goes to the bush, jayce gets a full rotation off of free harass and damage, and will have kill potential after that on darius unless he backs after clearing a ward. If he just lets it get frozen, his jungler won't have vision of the bush/river and will also know that the enemy will see him coming. Not worth it. \n\nIt's situations like those that worry me. If darius chooses to not clear the ward, he also has to sit back potentially beyond xp range if he's on red side because he can't risk a gank through the tribush. And if jayce is already a kill + CS up on him, he has to literally sit at the back end of his tower if they have a jungler that can successfully dive him with jayce's help. (I know no one is going to dive a darius lol, but bear with me here.)\n\nI do agree with a lot of what you're saying though. good thoughts.","replies":[{"poster":"Fondling Gems","date":"2016-10-28T02:12:21.753+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And what if Darius buys a 50 gold control ward and puts it in the same bush?  If they cancel each other out then there is no vision for either of them and they are in the same position.  It also has no fundamental difference of Jayce throwing a pink in that bush since Darius currently still has to do the same thing with the same result.  If he wards it jayce can still clear it from afar due to the pink.  For ranged champions there ins't a mechanical difference in defending your own control ward from defending a pink ward.  The only difference is in ranged champions trying to CLEAR control wards, as they have to walk into the bush, just like melee champs.\n\nFor melee champs there is not difference in defending, or clearing, control wards as opposed to pinks.  I also highly doubt the ward gets oppressed by a control ward immediately.  So long as it provides a moment of vision you can still ward a control warded bush to check if the jgler is in it.  \n\nReally I see it as a pink ward that no longer counters champs and brings ward clearing to an even level for both ranged and melee champs.","replies":[{"poster":"five oh tree ","date":"2016-10-28T18:46:20.814+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even if a pink is thrown into a bush with a stealth ward, the stealth ward still grants vision currently. The control ward takes it away. And if darius goes all the way over to the bush to throw his ward in, he still eats a full rotation and is put at a disadvantage. \n\nThe fundamental difference is that control wards take away vision, while pink wards do not. \n\nIf darius puts the control ward in the river bush first, then the same thing will happen. Jayce will have to walk to the bush and darius will probably get a kill on him because jayce has to be in melee range. \n\nRight now, in an even lane, the enemy can have a pink in the bush if he wants to, I can still throw a ward in it and see the river. And because the lane is even, neither of us are going to go clear the ward and put ourselves at a potential disadvantage. With control wards, it won't matter. The person with the control ward has the advantage over the lane. And if both people have a control ward, they're just going to play super safe because being more than 40% across your lane without vision is suicide.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Eetheart","date":"2016-11-26T03:35:33.731+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let's get this straight:\nWhen the enemy puts down a ward next to my control ward, will they be able to see my Control Ward??","replies":[]},{"poster":"Filthy Rank","date":"2016-11-18T11:10:02.657+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yep it's really frustating for my shaco ap lane :/","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Blue Rajah","date":"2016-10-27T15:19:08.887+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You asked if there's any nerfs compared to pinks, and there's a few.
