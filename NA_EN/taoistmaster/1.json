He can't have both with his power budget as it is.\n\nI already mentioned that the new W could be used in combination with Q to cause a stun/more damage, as a replacement for the old double-bombo-combo.\nThe current W does nothing beyond reducing Zilean's Q and E cooldowns. That's about as interesting as Warwick's W, except it doesn't actually do anything directly. A more dynamic spell in the W slot would make Zilly more interesting, to say the least.\nTo relate to you as a support player, I ask you to think of Zyra. Her W is a temporary ward (possibly a reveal) if used alone. It's better if used in combination with her Q or E because of the plants, but it does something on its own. If Zyra's W didn't provide any vision, Zyra would likely never place it if she wasn't going to use her Q or E, and it would go to waste if she didn't use the seedlings immediately.\n\nI understand that it would probably be necessary to nerf Zilean in some way in order to give him another damaging ability, but I think it would improve him in terms of general viability and fun without making him broken.","replies":[{"poster":"Lovely Pants","date":"2015-03-02T07:10:22.211+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not sure I understand what you think would be improved by making W a self-sufficient button. Let me try to clarify our understanding here.\n\nAre you arguing that Zilean doesn't have enough options as a champion already and that the benefits his W grants should be shifted directly into his other abilities?\n\nIf you are, I can't agree. Zilean is already chock full of dynamic play. Granting two strong speed boosts or slows to different units offers an insane amount of possible battlefield control decisions to be made with potent strategic consequences. With the rework adding on an aoe stun, adding any more impactful options past that to a champion whose big-ticket trick is reversing a death strikes me as asking for a severely overloaded balance mess. \n\nYou have to consider how potent Zilean's new AOE stun is. It's nearly as powerful as an Amumu ultimate if Zilean is allowed to execute it.  Granted, in the present state the stun is very difficult to land properly. However, I cannot imagine that Riot will leave it in the currently frustrating situation of the bomb targeting. Once quality of life changes are made on the targeting, the reliability of landing the stun will amp up considerably. Reliable ranged damage cannot coexist with that effect on a champion who also has Zilean's ultimate. \n\n----\n\nLet's step away from balance concerns for a moment and approach our argument from the more basic design points I think we are not seeing eye to eye on. \n\nThe existence of Zilean's W in its current form is not to make him stronger as a champion. In fact, it is the opposite. It is an intentional limiter on his kit which forces him to make certain choices and forces his abilities to be executed at a specific cadence. It is similar to any skill which grants a short window of stat boosts. You could just add those stats passively to the champion, but you don't want them to have constant access to them. You want them to choose when to make the most out of those stats. \n\nMy fear is that in an attempt to make W a dynamic button in its own right, you would make Zilean's kit as a whole lose its dynamic nature and feel just the same as the majority of mage champions.","replies":[{"poster":"Zarxis","date":"2015-03-02T08:50:32.761+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lovely Pants,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=i5U8KAkE,comment-id=0026000000000000,timestamp=2015-03-02T07:10:22.211+0000)\n>\n> snip\n\n\nYou do realize that all other champions have four dynamic abilities, minus the few that have true passives in their non-passive slots?\nZilean's W simply serves to enable his double-bomb combo and make his E have a reasonable cooldown. It used to be necessary for his ultimate to have a decent cooldown— to make Zilean viable, really. Now that W doesn't do that (R simply has a low cooldown), it's even less interesting/dynamic.\nZilean does have his high points, but he is held back by having an extra button to press for something that could be done with one. You could make the argument that Heimerdinger's ultimate does the same thing, but it has a longer cooldown (you aren't using it practically every time it comes up), requires more decision-making (which ultimate to use), and is more dynamic/fun (which option will Heimer use in a given situation). Again, Zilean's W is just a gate (a hefty mana-based one) for his Q, and nothing more than a way to balance his E. His Q and E have fairly long cooldowns because of his W; giving him a new W would allow for more tactical playmaking and perhaps decrease Zilean's mana issues (many newer Zilean players, even during the days of Athene's providing extremely strong mana regen, opted for Clarity over Ignite or Exhaust). Most champions have 4 ways to dynamically influence the game; many have even more. I don't see why Zilean players should have to track two separate cooldowns for their basic abilities— it adds practically nothing to Zilean's identity (especially now that it doesn't work on his ultimate), it's a button that basically does nothing, it's a chunk of mana that you really don't want to have to spend...\nAs you stated yourself, the stun is very difficult to land properly. The Q itself is difficult to land properly, and you get a very limited amount of control over when/where that AOE stun/damage will be (unless you land a double Q— extreme difficulty, especially with so many mobile champions around). There may be balance issues in the future as a result of Riot adding the sort of stun that Sejuani has as an ultimate to Zilean's basic abilities, but that's not the point. There are other, less unwieldy ways of making the rest of Zilean's kit balanced that don't require him to effectively have no W, and he could be a much more interesting champion to play as and against if he had another form of interaction.\nI understand your fear of Zilean losing his unique kit-identity and cadence... Which is why I mentioned the possibility of giving his Q a charge system and retaining the double-bomb combo that you're used to. His W could help him resonate more with his identity as a time mage by allowing him to do something more dynamic than simply reducing the cooldowns of his Q and E. Think of the champions with innate CDR, like Zyra and Ryze... They do it passively because it's not fun to have to manually change them every time you want to use your other abilities with a reduced cooldown. It's an awkward, dull, costly mechanic that isn't necessary to retain Zilean's playstyle. Imagine if Zilean could do something like Kunkka's Z Mark the Spot, from DotA. Forgive me for taking something from LoL's main competitor and trying to paste it onto one of our champions, but it would work perfectly with Zilean, thematically— a time mage resetting someone's location (ally and/or enemy) after a delay. It wouldn't make him more of a homogenized mage; it would put him in a state not unlike Bard's. He'd provide more unique utility power at the cost of limited direct offense.\n\nAgain, I do acknowledge that Zilean is a difficult champion to balance, but I must repeat that him having a W that serves as a boring handicap rather than a fun asset is not a good way to fill his ability slots. There are other ways to balance out the strengths of the rest of his kit without sacrificing his identity.","replies":[{"poster":"Lovely Pants","date":"2015-03-02T14:35:30.599+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here is the thing: I don't realize that all other champions have four buttons that enable them to make more dynamic actions than Zilean. I don't think that is true. How many utility-heavy mages have more options available to them than Zilean?\n\nI'll compare Zilean to Zyra, who you mentioned earlier. She is also a utility-strong mage who I enjoy playing as a support from time to time, so I will do my best not to undersell her for the sake of stacking points in my favor.\n\nStrictly looking at their individual combat performance:\n\nZilean:\n-Has moderate harass with his Q with windows where he can offer moderate burst.\n-May scout fog or brush with Q\n-Can unreliably apply an aoe stun, more reliable in defensive use on himself or an ally.\n-May speed up an ally\n-May slow an enemy\n-Reverses a death and damage on one ally with his ultimate.\n\nZyra:\n-Has good, reliable harass with her Q\n-Has a defensively reliable aoe root. \n-May scout fog or brush with W\n-May grant additional harass with WQ\n-May grant additional single-target CC with WE.\n-Strong burst and AOE knockup with her ultimate.\n\n-Zyra also contributes a small amount of unreliable damage in the event that she dies in combat. I hesitate to place it into the category of meaningful actions she has access to due to its infrequency, but let's acknowledge that it is there and it adds a revenge-kill risk to champions who try to all in her.\n\nIn terms of the basic active, meaningful decisions these champions make, Zilean is not significantly outweighed in number of options. We can argue back and forth on the comparative strengths of each set of abilities, but that's a different point. If Zilean needs individual options to be stronger, that's one thing. I don't see that granting him additional options is beneficial.\n\n---\n\nLet me more specifically state that I think all that Zilean currently needs to be a strong, perfectly viable pick is to give quality of life buffs to the reliability of his bomb placement. He will continue to be a more niche pick who depends greatly on the combination of his abilities with ally champion picks.\n\nI can come back when I have more time to argue about the value of keeping W in his gameplay, but right now I'm going to have to focus down on my confidence that Zilean does not benefit from another lever added to his balance issues for the sake of strategic power.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Phanron","date":"2015-03-01T18:53:14.367+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm new to Zilean and only picked him up after his rework. He is very fun. However something  with his laning is strange to me. I have a rather high succes rate when it comes to hitting ONE bomb. But honestly that doesnt seem to be a big deal for the enemy. The poke is nice but its not on the level old Zilean used to be, when he just forced you out off lane with his ridiculous base damage.\n\nOn the other hand, attempting the double bomb is a) really hard to hit and b) super mana consuming. It takes 210+ mana for a q - w - q combo. (He has like ~400 Mana at level 1) It only seems to be efficient when you attempt an all in and spend another 50 Mana to slow the enemy first.\n\nAfter laning however Zilean becomes godly. He can lock down an enemy really long: Slow with e, double bomb a 1,5 sec stun, then slow again. So fun. Also having Frostqueen makes it really easy to hit those double bombs. I once engaged a teamfight like this and felt GLORIOUS.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dukarg","date":"2015-03-01T17:51:23.927+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"they need to ditch the W and just make that a stun.

Not the best support, but he sure is fun once you get the hang of him. \n\nZilean isn't supposed to do damage as a support. **What he really brings to the table is utility**. This is why so many people have been maxing Q and been dissapointed. Maxing either Q or E first increases his mana costs. Maxing W however does not and it puts all of his kit's utility on a lower CD. The skill order I've been using to much success is R>W>Q>E. \n\nZilean plays a lot like Janna, but with a bit more poke. Your job as support Zilean is just to keep your adc alive with that awesome stun. It doesn't matter that your bombs don't do damage. By keeping it at level 1, it only costs 60 mana. This lets you spam it pretty often after getting some basic support mana regen items. The enemy won't care about your damage, but they will care about that stun. You should still try to land those bombs on them and if they don't show you respect by backing off, drop a slow and a follow up bomb. At 20% CD, which isn't too hard to get as support, Zilean can do this every 5 seconds. It's incredible for zoning and peeling. Once you get good at landing your stuns your lane will be easy to gank for your jungler. A slow is extremely helpful with this and since you're maxing W you can get 2 slows which is 5 seconds of CC in one fight.\n\n~~It's in the right direction, but I don't like them right now. Mana costs way too high, Q is way too unreliable and does underwhelming damage. They need to increase the missile speed and have the 2nd bomb prioritize targets with bombs already on them.~~","replies":[]},{"poster":"OperationDEEZ1","date":"2015-03-01T15:42:28.464+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well at least Riot did **something** right for a change.","replies":[{"poster":"TaoistMaster","date":"2015-03-01T16:10:25.771+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=OperationDEEZ1,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=i5U8KAkE,comment-id=002a,timestamp=2015-03-01T15:42:28.464+0000)\n>\n> Well at least Riot did **something** right for a change.\n\nget that negativity out of my thread.\n\nriot has been giving me a free to play game for years. they have constantly been updating it, giving us more champions to play, skins, and much more.\n\n\nthey don't need passive aggressive and negative comments.

Bombs are easy to dodge for a lot of champs.\n\n\nI had a match up against kat. I thought, sweet, i can double bomb stun her during her ult. She couldnt kill me, but she was able to dodge a lot of bombs and still land her abilities and was able to out farm and roam.\n\n\nZilean is a support now.
