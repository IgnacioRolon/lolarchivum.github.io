What Do You Miss The Most?","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":29,"down_votes":1,"body":"SO much has changed since I started back in S2. And even more if you started in Beta!\r\n\r\nI am not here to argue whether or not changes were good or bad for the game, just to be a little nostalgic about some of the &quot;old&quot; gameplay and balance.\r\n\r\n\r\n1) I REALLY miss being able to place as many wards down as gold would allow me for support. Yes, the support items and changes were for the best.. but when you got that edge as support and had a bunch of gold to spend.. you could light the entire map up like a Christmas Tree! The advantage your team got (if you were smart enough) was Enormous!  \r\n\r\n2) Look at my name.. I miss atmas a lot.\r\n\r\n3) I had a friend that loved warmog stacking mundo.. for one day i would love for him to be able to play that again. I really cannot describe the hilarity that was {{champion:36}} {{item:3083}}  {{item:3083}}  {{item:3083}}  {{item:3083}}  {{item:3083}}  {{item:3083}} \r\n\r\n4) I started back in S2 and back then {{champion:20}} was a top tier support. I really miss that because that was the first champ and role I learned. Day 1 of S3 and that was gone :(\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are some things you miss?
