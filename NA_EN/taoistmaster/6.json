Riot then had to nerf all tank items and make them work only by stacking lots of defensive items together (see: Thornmail, Cinderhulk, Warmog, etc) this way you are forced to build really tanky to take advantage of those items, thus preventing fighter abuse because fighters generally want to first build either damage or damage/tanky items, not dedicated tanky items.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"KrugLyfe","date":"2016-02-23T13:30:57.720+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah it's really strong but it can be weak if you get behind","replies":[{"poster":"KaisadiIIa","date":"2016-02-23T20:22:28.553+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What is not weak if you get behind?","replies":[{"poster":"KrugLyfe","date":"2016-02-23T20:29:58.318+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Malphite","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Bearded Bard","date":"2016-02-23T20:26:28.777+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:63}} {{champion:45}} {{champion:1}} {{champion:16}} {{champion:61}} etc\n\nStill gonna be strong when behind because of their base numbers/cc/utility.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Serika Zero","date":"2016-02-23T19:04:31.786+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because the AP itemization for assassins sucks.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AlexThePuppy x3","date":"2016-02-23T12:44:34.939+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"and because everyone wants a rework for her..she become boring to play...so I think it helps if u change the play style with her idk...riot rework her as fast as possible pls :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"AMYS GRAVE","date":"2016-02-23T19:32:37.095+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Bruiser itemization is so strong that most assassins when built bruiser are annoying af to deal with.
