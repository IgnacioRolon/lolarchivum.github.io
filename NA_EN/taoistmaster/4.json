He eats everything. Same goes for Kog Maw. Such beings would fit much better into the old lore via background expansion rather than attempting to create lore past their captures -- which is pretty much exactly what all old lore consisted of outside of events. Is that a bad thing? I definitely don't think so seeing as typically when I read background lore I expect to see background lore.\n\nTL;DR - Further Cho lore would be backsteps, telling tales of the Void or perhaps maybe he had some hand in what went on in the Howling Abyss, who knows?\n\nAny other champion you think is unable to thrive in an IoW environment?","replies":[{"poster":"Quort","date":"2016-01-29T20:52:57.697+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"ChoGath is a highly intelligent void being and I believe most people forget that precisely because of the lack of expansion to his current. His goal is supposedly to consume the world, but do we really know? All Void creatures have a propensity to destroy but there seems to be overwhelming evidence that it's not simply for the sake of destruction (KogMaw, KhaZix, and VelKoz actively try to learn about their surroundings and adapt to Runeterra). As long as the Institute of War is canon, ChoGath has no story outside of his capture. In fact, many of the Void creatures and even the Void itself will remain unexplored. There are plenty of ways ChoGath can or could have interacted with Runeterra and the other Champions that would create a compelling story.\n\nI agree that it's important that each Champion have a fundamental background to build upon but most of them are just uninspired (just look at Evelynn's lore; it doesn't actually provide anything substantial).\n\nI'm sure you could come up with plenty of reasons for most Champions to join the League, that's not the issue. The issue is that that limits the storytelling. If the Institute of War was canon, everything would be stagnant and the story of Runeterra could not progress.\n\nI like the movement Riot has made with their lore, though I am a little miffed at how long it has taken to come out. The newer Champions, like Bard and Kindred, have no place in an Institute of War. It just gets in the way of what's possible.","replies":[{"poster":"OyddAWqJ5r","date":"2016-01-30T03:07:49.692+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yes, Cho is intelligent, which is entirely a point i thought of when thinking what he could be outside the rift. Well, nothing. He just wants to destroy everything. The best he can do is play the villain in some other champion's lore or an event.\n\nTherefore, the concept of expanding his background is a much more attractive option (i would really like it if he actually did have a hand in the Howling Abyss).\n\nAnd Evelynn's lore sucks because it was uninspired and written badly. As one of the earlier champs this sort of thing happens. But she could play all kinds of roles in the IoW. Summoners may be powerful, but they aren't gods. They can't control everything. Nor can they control each other.\n\nThere's plenty of lore possibilities for both the IoW itself and every champion in it. If they really wanted it gone they should have had an event where the summoners were all killed and the IoW destroyed. How is this possible? Well, another summoner war, brought about by thirst for power, manipulation, etc. Voidling invasion? Watcher's return?
