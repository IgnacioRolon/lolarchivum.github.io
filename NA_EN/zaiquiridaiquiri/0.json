After the game, I checked the store to see if I could select them in the store, but they didn't show up there, either. I submitted a ticket yesterday, but haven't heard back yet. \r\n\r\nHas anyone else had this problem? If so, how did you fix it? Help would be much appreciated! Thanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-03T16:54:07.012+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's currently an issue where some ward skins are not selectable despite being unlocked on the account.  We don't have an eta for this currently.  I did look into your specific issue and can confirm that both the Tomb Angel and Lantern of the Serpent wards are indeed on the account.  Hope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"ZaiquiriDaiquiri","date":"2016-08-03T17:06:39.957+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok, great! Just glad the problem is acknowledged.
