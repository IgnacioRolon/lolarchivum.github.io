Tanky, but has a hard time solo-laning or jungling, because she cannot proc her own passive.  \n\n{{champion:40}}: The Tried and True support.  Knockups, knockbacks, Targetted slow, shield that protects both ally and turret, and adds Damage to the ally, based on her own AP.  Team-wide AOE healing skill that can provide peel, or with a tricky flash+ult, an engage that separates the carries from their defenses.\n\n{{champion:161}}: No hate, but... Highly damaging Passive that's designed to clear waves and cut through defenses with ease.  Skillshot slow and skillshot knockup, that's designed to set up for the ultimate that's able to CUT THROUGH AN ENTIRE TEAM, stacking Magic and True damage onto the enemies that it hits.\n\n{{champion:1}}: Situational Stun, Targeted damage that's designed to improve last-hitting, AOE ability that's good for clearing waves and finishing a teamfight, a Defense steroid made to help her survive lane trades, Point and Click, negligible cast-time AOE BURST ultimate that (Now especially) fights even harder after she dies, making a kill on her less worth the effort, because she'll take down 1-2 people who are close enough to invoke tibbers' wrath.\n\nNow, the issue at hand, really, is that Supports, at their core, should be there to spoonfeed kills to the carry, not assists.  Many people who bring mages into botlane don't build support items, which ends up leaving the team lacking vision options until Farsight unlocks.  \n\nI play off-meta supports, I play them frequently, but I'm also normally not stacking up kills.  I'm running Illaoi, with a tanky bruiser build that's designed to whittle down lane enemies until either my Carry can score a kill, or has a free lane to farm to their heart's content.  I also rush my sightstone option (Normally the FotM/SS item), and slowing items that make me tankier, and let my Carry lay down damage upon our foes.","replies":[{"poster":"Verdade","date":"2016-11-15T16:45:35.791+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay, so ill try to explain.\n\nClassic supports wield only small amount of raw power, however they multiply power of their teammates.\nMage supports have carry-like power, but they don't interact with their teammates much.\n\nNow, if your team has 1 carry and 4 support-ish campions, you can remove like 80% of that team's power by CCing or killing said carry.\nBut if you have 3 carries, power of your team is much more evenly distributed, meaning that even if your ADC dies you still have tons of power and losing one member doesn't mean instant loss.\n\nNow, this is reason why are mage supports more viable in unorganized play - you can't rely on your teammates TOO much. \n\nAdditionaly, mage supports can cover his teamteam's weaknesses, which happens quite frequently - for example when your team has too much physical damage, when it lacks waveclear, when is your mid and top melee, when you check your ADC's stats and you find that he's unreliable/can't carry well...","replies":[{"poster":"10Tickler","date":"2016-11-15T17:13:06.281+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"The point that you're making, while valid, is incredibly biased, however, around personal glory and preferences. \n\nLook at a few things in counter to your points.\n\n1: Carries are exponentially less likely to die easily with a CC/Enchanter Support behind them.  Janna shields and heals, Soraka silences and mega-heals, Karma Shields and MS buff, CC to keep the enemy team back and away, Tankiness to distract the enemy with an 'easy' kill that wastes their time while you keep popping a Leona shield, or peel off the entire team with a well-placed nami/sona ult.\n\n2:  Meta, which is to say, what's played and where.  Right now, the Ranged fighter, the Light Fighter and the Juggernaut are making their presence known top.  Gone are the days of the Malphite and Nasus, here and now are Kled, Fiora, Darius and Gnar, all of whom provide quite a lot of carry potential, just by sheer stick-to-it-iveness.  In mid you've got either one, or the other.  AP mages, or AD assassins, both of which exist to pop squishy targets where they stand.  \n\nOn the other side of things, your popular junglers currently (And forever, if we're being honest) are the hyper-mobile bruisers who can get where they need to go to secure more pressure for their lanes.  Your Lees, Xins, and othersuch fast-movers who exist to get kills so lanes can push and push hard.\n\nThen you've got your ADC's, which, far as I know, the perennial favorites are the ones still played.  Lucian, Jhin, Miss Fortune, Ashe and Ezreal tend to stay on the slightly-strong side of balanced.\n\nYou've got four roles who normally play something with massive amounts of damage, usually leaving the Support to pick and choose what'll work best.  With penetration/Lethality scaling higher than defenses (By design, Morello has said that they didn't want a 'boring' game), at all points, save for the very start, damage will beat out tankiness.  Picking a secondary AP carry adds more damage, but reduces the team's survival chances, probably by close to the same amount as your damage lost calculation.\n\nYou're right though, unless you're in discord/skype, or on an organized team, picking a more punishing champion does work for the best usually, because in most ELO below Gold 1/Plat, your team can't really be counted on.  But, just recall, a big part of winning?  Vision, and in your quest for AP and kills to secure that win, you need to ask yourself a few questions.\n\n> Can my team see the enemy team?\n\nIf not, you need to be warding more, because that lack of information will lose you the game.\n\n> is my getting kills damaging our lategame for the actual 'carry'?\n\nif so, then your playstyle is negative, and going to end up leaving your ADC/Jungler/Mid toxic and bitter, less likely to help you come lategame.","replies":[{"poster":"Verdade","date":"2016-11-15T19:55:34.706+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I get your point, but you have to realize few things:\nMost mage support mains aren't selfish killstealing full-damage guys. \nI play champions such as Sona, Nautilus, Bard (used to play Kench) and while i prefer VK, im not hesitating to pick them when situation demands it.\n\nNow, as far warding goes - it's crucial. When you're playing champion who can project damage much furthner than he can see, who is immobile and literallg squishier than adc, you cant afford losing vision and information about enemies.\n\nAbout taking kills - im getting tons of solo kills in duo lane. When i hit 6 and land EWR on enemy carry, he's dead. This combo can burn through full HP+heal very easily. So if i catch enemy carry i won't stop channeling R so my ADC takes the kill. If he takes it im okay, i don't care as i don't need much gold. But im not leaving any chances for enemy to run.\n\nAnd finally: Brand and VK tend to dictate flow of the game and enemy's tactics. For example, trying to group against Brand is asking for disaster, as he can singlehandedly annihilate 3-4 man sqad if he catches them. Similarily, VK is champion capable of holding turret in 1v3 under right circumstances. Also, ability to kill 4k hp Garen with 200ar/mr in 3 seconds is also useful.","replies":[{"poster":"TyrekGoldenspear","date":"2016-11-16T02:02:39.979+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> For example, trying to group against Brand is asking for disaster, as he can singlehandedly annihilate 3-4 man sqad if he catches them.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/f7FdEdG.jpg","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Immortal spax","date":"2016-11-15T09:14:17.462+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"its the second plan, when a support main keeps play with bad adcs so he wants to play another carry","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ArbiterOfTruth","date":"2016-11-15T05:53:28.897+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or ya know an actual support like {{champion:432}}","replies":[{"poster":"Verdade","date":"2016-11-15T13:01:41.316+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bard is too hard to be played in free rotation, he's different from anything in league.","replies":[{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2016-11-15T16:04:45.513+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Their point is to try to help people find a support they find *fun*, not easy.
