This SHOULD be the VU IMO. What do you guys think?\r\n\r\nThe source page and creator's post.\r\nhttp://www.polycount.com/forum/showthread.php?t=128805","replies":[{"poster":"NoxiousIce","date":"2014-06-08T13:34:37.992+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I appreciate the time the person put into creating this, but I really dislike the bathing suit she is wearing, her design smells of shark which I dont like, her boots remind me of Cait, her cape is too short, and she seems to have lost the potential for the sleek and sexy tango dancer, and masquerader that I love. Additionally no particular part of her goes \"BAM! Take THAT! Yeah! I'm Evelyn!\" It all just goes \"woo, high poly count ftw.\"\n\nIt is certainly a creative Evelyn, but I feel like it lost a bit too much of who she is to get there.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Neverworld","date":"2014-05-31T18:18:11.730+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You forgot a third option \"Not bad - Not best\"\n\nI would take this option (didn't either participate on the poll).\n\nHowever, while yes it looks good, there are some points I have some doubt in.\n\nFirst. The waist is pretty much too wide, it's not like the original Eve looks like.\n\nSecond. The hair looks a bit too plastic and the cape is a bit too short.\n\nAnd Third. Too much details. Never forget that League of Legends is a MOBA and you play Eve from a far distant view, which make too many details unnecessary.","replies":[{"poster":"Hyrum Graff","date":"2014-06-01T15:55:34.334+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> First.

Maybe it's not like Eve *does* look, I think it's how she *should* look, ie, more realistic.\n \n> Second.
