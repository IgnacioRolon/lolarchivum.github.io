If i was a pro i would stream whenever im not watching replays or doing scrims it make fans happy and u make good money. When imaqtpie was on dig playing in the lcs he probly made a extra 5k a month from running ads,donation,subs one month he hit  3000 subs they get $2.50 per sub 3000 x 2.50 =7500 for 1 month of streaming he made a extra 7500k+ donation and ads he probly made around 8.5k that month from streaming. And that is why im making this post to see what others think about people not streaming","replies":[{"poster":"nsanity27","date":"2015-02-28T19:00:30.520+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are many reasons why someone would not stream despite the money associated with having a popular stream. First, streaming isn't profitable unless you have a huge audience. Why would someone go through all the trouble to start the stream, interact with the chat, and everything else associated with streaming if they didn't have a lot of people watching them. If someone like Rydle was to stream, how many people do you think would watch him? Now, assume that only 5-10% of those people will support the stream (subbing, donating) and you're left with a very small amount of money. Some people figure that they make enough money through their contracts, and so they don't need the extra income, and if they're one of the more \"unpopular\" pro players, the extra income may not be worth it. Also, the amount of time required from pro players means that it is a full time job. To stream on top of that would be like having both a full time and part time job. Some people can handle it, others cannot. These are just some of the reasons, and some people before me have said some others.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vixanys","date":"2015-02-27T15:10:46.550+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As mentioned in other comments, there are other platforms besides Twitch (Koreans use Azubu or other Korean equivalent most Korean teams are Kespa contracted which forces them to use Azubu).\n\nThe reason I see that most Pros in NA/EU LCS don't stream as often is because of the demands for their time. 8-12 hours a day dedicated to Scrims, Team stuff, VOD review. Not to mention travel time for LCS if they are not located in Los Angeles/Cologne or in relatively close proximity.\n\nStill common streams: Saintvicious, Dyrus, Bjergersen, Piglet (on and off), Krepo, DiamondProx, IWD, Hai, Sneaky, Wickd (RIP), Nukeduck, and likely others (Not on my rader) :3","replies":[]},{"poster":"Albireo","date":"2015-02-27T05:13:26.996+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you mean pros from other reagions, they do, but they have contracs with services other than twitch. But they do, and from NA / EU they do, but they do have diferent times to do it, not sure if teams do have rules to not stream at the same time, for example if you do want to see saint vicius, he usually play really late at night for east coast time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"YeOldeScrub","date":"2015-02-27T03:39:12.136+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know Sneaky and Hai stream time to time.

I see Cloud 9 sometimes, but not that often.  As for the rest, idk. I see Froggen from elements, but he's the only elements member I see stream. Although now that Krepo's on, he counts too I guess, and Kev1n used too as well, but idk if he still does. I don't know anyone else that streams on LCS teams.\n\nEdit: As soon as I say that, I see Rekkles streaming, I think this is the first time I've seen him on.","replies":[]},{"poster":"hh the thinker","date":"2015-02-27T00:13:49.634+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i see more that stream, you just have to look for them.","replies":[]}]}
