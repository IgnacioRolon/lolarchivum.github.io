Like I've gotten 3 450 champions, aka 90 essence each, 3 levels in a row which is around 30-45 games for a little over 450 essence. Even if I got 6300 champions for 3 levels I'd still only have enough essence for a 3175-4800 champion assuming I didn't want any of the shards I got.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rito Pls Nerf Vi","date":"2017-11-26T22:43:09.899+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"this is completely irrelevant, my point was that it takes way too long to get a champ i WANT (lets also throw in the fact that i started at 3500ish ip) so 52 games later ive gained less than 2800 ip nearly half of what you claim it used to be, if you're gonna try to use numbers at least make sure you have them all before you try.\n\nALSO ive been getting some of the higher tier champs in some of my rerolls so there is also the potential for it to take even LONGER than it has so far.\n\nso not only is the system slower than the old one, the rng has the potential to force some players to take WAY longer than normal to unlock a champ\n\nalso my last 8 games without any ingame currency progression have been very rewarding, i sincerely am enjoying no progression even more than i thought i would.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"wibblemu9","date":"2017-11-25T22:14:26.016+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lmao the consequences of these changes are actually hilarious.
