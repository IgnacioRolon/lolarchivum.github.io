This is a problem for me since I switch between a 1080p external monitor and playing on a Retina Macbook Pro screen. I have to stay in 1080p at all times to avoid this problem, and - as someone who also uses the minimap regularly to enhance gameplay - it's a simple problem that's an easy fix.

Unfortunately no minimap update with the new map.  Anyone else having trouble with this?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talzon1001001","date":"2014-11-08T10:05:14.636+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree.  Its really annoying to have to play at 1440x900 or something like that because I actually use my minimap to play the game and support my team.  The landscape and everything about the game looks great at the highest resolution on my retina display but the cursor also shrinks with the icons.  Losing your cursor in a team fight=instant death.  So please Riot fix this issue for the mac client.  I know a few other players with pc's and they seem to be unaffected, which makes this problem more frustrating, as do all the fixes out there that used to work before being disabled by a patch.\n\nI think its great that Riot does all this in depth and cool stuff to increase strategic diversity, but a little attention to the game client is also important.  Hopefully the SR update will come with a fix for this as well.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Th3 Ch4mp","date":"2016-12-28T01:08:00.173+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You would think after 2 years this issue would be solved. Especially with the growing popularity of 4k monitors. Just got mine and there are 0 fixes I've found so far. This is really frustrating because lowering the resolution from 4k down to 1080 looks like a 360p video off YouTube. I don't enjoy playing on what looks like a garbage quality YouTube video JUST so I have the privilege of being able to look at my mini-map. Really sad to see the lack of support for 4k especially on such a triple A game like league. {{item:3070}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Spodos","date":"2015-12-01T05:21:03.871+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I run at 4K and this is a huge annoyance.","replies":[]}]}
