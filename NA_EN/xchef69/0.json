This one game on it's own isn't enough to warrant a punishment to an account with a clean slate.\n\n As you get punished, your account gets placed on thinner and thinner ice, meaning something like this (that is on the more tame side even though it is still negative) will trigger the next punishment. You escalated your account to a 14 day ban, the next one _will_ be permanent.\n\n Asking for reports is considered player harassment. One report is worth the same as nine, just report the player at the end of the game and move on. There's no need to get other players to join you in reporting, it doesn't accomplish anything and can breed negativity in most scenarios.","replies":[{"poster":"xChef69","date":"2018-12-26T21:19:45.482+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Its the first ban,and why is considered player harassment to suggest your team to report him to keep this \"community clean\" and get this guy banned for destroying our experience and game,instead of banning us 14 days only for this reason just ban the chat,so we cant use swear words or other things like this,i think this ban should be for people who grief or go afk all the time.","replies":[{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2018-12-26T21:31:01.333+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"You don't need to ask for reports. 1 report work the same way as 9 reports.

The punishment ladder goes: \n\n* 10 Game Chat Restriction\n* 25 Game Chat Restriction\n* 14 Day Gameplay Ban\n* Permanent Ban\n\n\n Was there anything else in your reform card? Hate speech such as homophobia or racism will result in 14 day bans immediately, but what you've posted here should have been a 10 game chat restriction at most if you didn't have any prior punishments.\n\n I'd suggest filing a [support ticket found here ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and explaining the situation if that was the case.\n\n Also, it's considered Player Harassment because it does nothing to help cleanse the community. Your report counts just as much as a hundred other people reporting them, asking for reports incites a bandwagon effect and will either cause fights between you two or involve the rest of the game in a small, trivial matter. \n\n Permanent chat bans have been proven to not work in the past, it just led to other players griefing areas of the game by going AFK or intentionally feeding. Swear words are usually fine as long as they aren't directed at people, but I'd take that with a grain of salt.

I have been there pal. 14 days ban 2 years ago, than back to Honor 5, than twice 10 days chat ban and after typing ONE SENTENCE  IN CHAT ROOM AFTER MATCH !

When I was honor 5 I typed a lot of shit ( without effort of course, idiots will stay idiots no matter how much you explain - they flame, afk, whine, troll, insult without any reason  ) and I was quite probably \"excused\" because of honor 5 long enough.
