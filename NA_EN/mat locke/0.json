Does nothing to solve the problem. Yes, it is frustrating that this is happening. Mediacom is notorious for having horrible customer service. They will flat out deny there is a problem in the first place until the tech comes out and finds out what is going on. \n\nWith call centers they probably memo the account but don't send that along. Riot has been nothing but upfront here in this thread in collecting and providing information. The whole situation isn't riots fault here but they are trying to help. \n\nI have contacted mediacom 3 times since this has started and the first 2 times I got the run around and they said there wasn't a problem. They denied adding ipv6 addresses to the lines. The 3rd time I called they finally admitted there was known issue. I GAVE THEM the email and nothing has come of it.\n\nThis is a difficult issue to troubleshoot because it's not effecting even all of mediacom customers. That is why riot is trying to get someone with their engineering department. So please be civil and act like adults here. If you are really that upset then get ahold of mediacom.

It's most likely a routing error, which just means that riot is not connecting to mediacom (in the simplest terms possible.) It's likely because Mediacom just did a huge system update from IPv4 to IPv6. Unless mediacom is intentionally \"blocking them out\" (which would be silly, considering they would lose a good mass of people that play the game to other net companies, even the crappier ones are better if you can't do what you want on the \"good\" one), Riot is the one that has to fix it, because they basically have to say that their servers can connect to Mediacom's servers in order to them to connect. Again, this is just as I understand it from literally everything I've researched (and I've had about..... 5 days to do so at this point) and my own general knowledge, broken down into common terms as much as possible, so if that doesn't make sense I apologize.\n\nWe all get that Mediacom is shit, but sometimes Riot is, too.
