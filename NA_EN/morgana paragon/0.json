Can't say I've ever seen anyone's chat contain only that statement.

If at any point it appears you're arguing you will be banned.\n\nThat doesn't sound right. We're not going to agree on strategy 100%, and I think there's some leeway with that. I would think that leeway is probably greater in the post game, since there's no way that's affecting in-game teamwork. You are still held responsible for your pre and post-game logs, so insults can factor into punishments.\n\n>If somebody in the game is going to insult me and tell me I'm a piece of shit and swear that 2+2=5 I'm going to debate that 2+2=4 until I'm blue in the face and I don't care what Riot or anyone else thinks.\n\nIf that's what you want to do then so be it, but I find it useless to argue with others who just continue to be jerks in game. I might say \"Let's focus on the game\" and when that doesn't work and their chat is clearly useless, I'm muting them. Nothing good can come from conversing with players who are bent on being toxic in game.","replies":[{"poster":"Morgana Paragon","date":"2019-04-25T17:19:10.227+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":5,"body":"You seem to be really misguided here.
