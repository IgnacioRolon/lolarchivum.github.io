Cosmetic Essences (orange) are currently exclusive to skins.  By obtaining a Zilean Shard, it won't be necessary to spend any additional essences.  I know there are a lot of gears working with Hextech Crafting and Masteries, but we have a solid [Hextech Crafting Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207884233-Hextech-Crafting-Guide) that may help!
