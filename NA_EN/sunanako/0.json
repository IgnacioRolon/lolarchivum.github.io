The reason for this start is because both heroes are very squishy and thus benefit from the extra lane sustain and the Warding Totem on both you and your carry should provide enough vision until you make your first back. Once you base, you'll want to pick up your Sightstone as fast as possible, as the earlier you get it, the more gold it saves you. Proceed to finish Frost Queen's Claim and go straight into Mikael's Crucible. From here you have some freedom with both heroes, as you can continue to build utility, hard Ability Power or tank. Just look to make yourself as useful as possible. If your Sona and you're your team's only engage, I'd build as a CDR tank. For Zyra, I'd aim for more Ability Power to make your poke/disengage more threatening. Don't forget to swap your Warding Totem for a Sweeper after you get Sightstone and also keep track of your Pink Wards.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PokladnicaZla","date":"2014-07-18T20:55:24.614+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"SONA\n\nFirst i buy Spellthiefs edge.then Sighstone/Chalice depending on the enemy team->Boots\n\nThen i finish Frost queens->Sighstone(oridnary)_>Boots of swiftness->Athens\n\nAfter that i build depending on the situation\n\nMR  Locket\n\nAR Frozen Hearth\n\nMore AP  Ardent\n\nMana Lichbane\n\n\nZYRA\n\nRush Frostqueens->Sighstone->Sorcerrer shoes\n\nOptions:Liandras(really good item on her) or others depeding on the enemy team( on Mage-supps i like to buy TwinsShadow/Lichbane/Ardent)\n\nON both i buy first yellow trinket and upgrade the Boots with the green upgrade(forgott how its called).buy red trinket if are warding your side to much/or have many champions with stealth,if not ugrade the yellow trinket into a pink ward.\n\n\nGL and i hoped i helped-","replies":[]},{"poster":"YouLostMe","date":"2014-07-18T18:57:31.660+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you really like to spam, rush a chalice and spam. If you're more conservative with your spells, skip the chalice.\n\nZyra is great with on-damage spell effects (Rylai, Liandry) which also make her tankier. Since she's a ball of squish, these are pretty good choices. The effects are also pretty independent of your AP, so if you're behind they're even better. She benefits greatly from CDR (but already comes with 10%, make sure you don't spend too much) so building anything from a Fiendish Codex is pretty good. Because she's immobile, she benefits greatly from hourglass. As a mage, she can always use more AP (deathcap) and penetration (void staff).\n\nSona pretty much spams spells, so a chalice is a must. You're better off just sitting on that while you pick up other items, then turn it into a grail or a crucible depending on how much CDR you want. Because she's a magey support but she's squishy, Ancient Coin or Spellthief's Edge are must-buys at the beginning, as is a sightstone. Sona is focused around providing huge hidden power and dropping clutch ults, so maxing CDR is a good idea. Generally I either get Crucible + Talisman or FQC + Grail. Both provide 30% CDR.","replies":[]},{"poster":"cshakes","date":"2014-07-18T16:05:19.734+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Support or midlane? [Here's Sona midlane.](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=sona+build+midlane) Sona support and Zyra mid/support can be found similarly.\nSpecific items: I suppose Sona could do with a Rod of Ages, being short-range and kind of squishy. Otherwise just a standard AP build, I guess. Zyra's plants benefit from Banner of Command's aura and AFAIK apply Liandry's Torment's burn with every attack. If in doubt, build AP if mid and support items if support.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dr Clueless PhD","date":"2014-07-18T16:03:56.940+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"[1](http://www.solomid.net)\n[2](http://www.lolpro.com)\n[3](http://www.probuilds.net)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Luner Hunter","date":"2014-07-19T04:26:45.052+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"you build up you're courage for the Sona rework... and plan on never touching her again... in the case of zyra as a support build a FQC and a sightstone if you want then go full AP after the laning phase is over flip the switch and go full ap carry","replies":[]}]}
