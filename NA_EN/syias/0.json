Only in a League game, doesn't happen in other games or while not in game. Happens frequently, somewhere around once every 10 seconds. The game screen will randomly turn black and freeze for about half a second, followed by a strong FPS drop the half second after. It's been driving me insane and I can't figure out what's causing it. Any help is appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-19T22:18:19.996+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This sounds like a really poor interaction with your display driver.
