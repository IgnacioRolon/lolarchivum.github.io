I have played at since 2009. I have had multiple accounts banned yet I have still spent money on. But this is the third account. That is it, I am done with this sissy pussy Asian controlled bitch company. I am done you have lost a customer. This used to be a great game. I love the lore. But your coward, weak, bitch ass banning policy is so un-American that I hope you people at riot do not vote. I log into league with this account and I log into the email and I don&#039;t even get a reason for why my account is banned. No fuck you. I hope this company dies a slow painful death. If this is how you treat long time customers FUCK YOU. Yea use your power to erase this simply truth. Six hundred dollars may seem like nothing to you but it is a lot to me. I understand the value of a dollar. You do no understand the value of a customer. You have lost me as loyal customer I will never play your game again. Thanks for the memories, maybe DOTA will appreciate my money.
