From this we were able to look a little bit deeper into this issue and believe we have a better understanding as to what is going on.  There is a bug with NA Dynamic Queue where certain players are getting \"locked\" into a state where they couldn't progress.  This occurred at the account level, so that account would essentially be permanently locked, but other accounts (like smurfs) would work fine.  \n\n>We went ahead and restarted this section which should have released everyone from this kind of purgatory, but we can't deploy a full fix just yet.  We're hoping to get it finish in time for the next patch, but I'll update everyone with more details later.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIt appears that there was a brief issue about an hour or two ago where games weren't starting correctly.  It seems that the issue was resolved, but I wanted to double-check with everyone that the queue seems to be working fine.\n\nReply back and let me know!","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-06-10T23:53:53.864+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Really damn appreciate all the responses from everyone!
