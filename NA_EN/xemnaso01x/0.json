A specialist will respond to your ticket which will come with an email notification.  You can reply to that email directly which acts just the same as your tickets section.  It's just another way of responding to the ticket.  Hope that helps clear things up!","replies":[{"poster":"XemnasO01X","date":"2016-10-04T23:36:31.775+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah that clears up a bit but I'm still just a bit concerned with not seeing my tickets and having no response in my email I just like to be updated on what's happening and how things are going.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
