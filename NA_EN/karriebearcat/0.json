I don't know what happened, each time I alt-tab back in it works for 2-3 seconds and it freezes and I have to repeat the process and because of this I almost got a penalty! Does anyone know how to fix this? My client is the old one I haven't updated it...","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-13T00:59:11.443+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There may be outdated drivers or bad game files post update causing your frames to drop, but something more serious could be going on if it's freezing completely.  I suggest starting out with our [FPS issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting) guide and going through each step to troubleshoot.  That should get you back in game without issue.","replies":[]}]}
