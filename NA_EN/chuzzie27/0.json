We are working on getting this fixed in the near future considering it looks extremely weird.\n\nAbout your bundle, I went ahead and took a look into your account.  I was able to confirm that you did in fact purchase Azir for IP, but I was not able to find any record of you purchasing the bundle with RP.  Since you purchased Azir with IP, this is why you are able to select Azir, but not his skin.\n\nHopefully this clarifies your issue!  If you still have further questions, feel free to let me know!","replies":[]}]}
