Late game he has no weakness, now i could see your point if teamfights didn't happen much late game but any competent team would always be together by that point. Another thing is, is laning phase sucks only if he is constantly getting ganked by which case he could just turret farm while the enemy jg waste time top lane and ally jg can camp bot and mid. His early game is not nearly weak enough to balance out his late game, at the very least his lifesteal has to go.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"JJ H0G","date":"2015-03-11T13:12:36.205+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Fun fact: Nasus is a shitty tank if he isn't Qing something to stay alive.
