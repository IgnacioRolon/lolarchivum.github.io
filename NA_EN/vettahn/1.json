It takes 1 game to learn each summoner. There is more time needed to increase depth on how to use a select few summoner abilities on certain champions or situations that comes along with experience. Experience somebody 1-30 would not get until they played a couple hundred+ games. So, restricting them makes no sense aside from giving players incentives to buy xp boosts to get summoner abilities. From a marketing stand point they would want you to believe they restrict it for the benefit of the player to not take in so much information but let's be real it isn't much we take in much more when we study for classes, work, or things in life in general.\n\n Do not tell me it is because it is to break down knowledge. That is idiotic and gives me this image on what the company has perceived players to be.

It simply comes down to encouraging people to spend money on xp boosts plain and simple it has nothing to do with players ability to learn because in order to utilize certain summoners as previously mentioned that experience comes along much after level 30. Most people do not properly use summoners to their fullest potential until they reach 400 games and even then they lack in depth experience on how to use them vs more experienced players. \n\nThat is not the case for everyone but they will understand the fundamental basic uses enough to the point where even a level 1 could use it just as well as a level 8-10 player. Not to mention match making is terrible for lower players now due to smurfs and also less increase in new players over time since the game has been out forever. Restricting summoner abilities makes zero sense when level 1's get paired against level 10-15 players in games. Same how level 7's can face lvl 20's. Masteries I understand as they would not impact the game as severely as having X summoner ability or giving people diversity in their play style early on. But also with the decrease in diversity in summoner spells half a decade I can easily say these are noob traps. People are not idiots they can get the basic ideas behind the summoner abilities but it's all about money see?

You in particular have been playing League at a high level for at least 3 years now.  You've had a lot of time to fine tune your abilities and really have the mechanics of the game sink in.  There is a lot you do in a basic league of legends match that you do without even having to think about because of the time you've put in to allow that to sink in.\n\nNo, for the most part people aren't idiots.

It doesn't mean you don't need any time to understand their details.\n\nYou're given time to learn the skills you need to succeed.

Barrier has uses similar to Heal, but the uses are a lot stricter and may be harder to understand, while Exhaust also has some well-defined use cases, but has a lot of broad interactions that are not easy for a new player to understand.\n\nAt level 6, you get Cleanse and Teleport. Both are really difficult to use properly because Cleanse needs really good timing to use and Teleport needs a level of map awareness that new players won't have. Same with when you get Flash and Clairvoyance at level 8: Flash has too many champion interactions for newer players to understand and new players don't understand the importance of map vision at early levels.\n\nSmite and Ignite are gotten at level 10 for very good reason. Smite is unplayable at anything lower than 10 because of how hard the jungle currently is, so Smite is useless until at least level 10, although the difficulty of the jungle would likely push the role until much closer to at least level 20. Ignite, on the other hand, has a really specific use case that is easy for new players to not understand. Ignite is used to help secure kills, but it is very likely for newer players to use this off cooldown just to deal some damage.\n\nIn addition to providing newer players with Summoner spells as they learn the basic skills needed to grasp the uses of these spells, gating the summoner spells like this also prevents new players from getting too overwhelmed by the concept of summoner spells when they first boot up the game. They can learn the basic game mechanics without being overwhelmed by the intricacies of each of the summoner spells.\n\nYou mentioned that players already know how to play Mobas would likely prefer to use the high-level summoner spells, but the problem with this argument is that players experience in playing Mobas would level their account up fast enough for the level gating not to matter. In addition, not every single game of a genre is the similar, and Mobas are no different. Even players of other Mobas may have trouble adjusting to League of Legends, so the gating of summoner spells would still be useful as they learn how different League of Legends is from other Mobas.","replies":[{"poster":"It Hertz When IP","date":"2015-03-16T02:25:58.290+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would contest your take on Teleport; while it does have a lot of strategic use whose nuances would escape a new player, as a \"get me back in lane faster\" ability it's still a decent choice and relatively straightforward option.

That is called depth of design. \n\nI think your problem here is that you're not able to filter out your personal experiences and understandings of the game through someone who lacks that knoweledge.  As I said, I watched two different people go through this learning process at the same time.  They didn't care about being able to get to other people's lanes or get over walls- they barely were able to handle not dying whenever the bots approached them.  So that's flash and teleport out for things they cared about.  Exhaust and Ignite? Sure they were fighting in lane, if you can consider \"standing still and hoping that my arrows kill this guy before he punches my face in\" a fight.  This is where RIOT is encouraging the players to focus on simply being able to survive in their lane over trying to get kills on enemies- afterall you can't be an effective teammate if you died in a random, useless skirmish.  If RIOT were to provide exhaust and ignite, they would TAKE exhaust and ignite... and die in the first seconds of the fight because they havne't learned to move and attack yet.\n\nHeal and Clarity are two spells that help a new player do things that a new player understands (\"make my resource bars go back up\") and provide something that RIOT wants to teach (\"don't die\").  \n\nThey are not being punished because they are not yet in a place where they need to know how to use that ability.

Most players would automatically recommend flash and so the noobs always equip flash. They will never get to experience many of the other summoner spells enough to build a good understanding without spending way more time than we already see.\n\nAlso, with the new Jungle, refraining from Smite is a good move to be frank. New players with no runes and very little understanding of Jungle kiting will almost always die and just get frustrated in the Jungle.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The5lacker","date":"2015-03-15T23:47:02.114+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Because working for things makes people appreciate them more.\n...\nI'm sorry, I can't keep a straight face.

The first time I entered PvP, I was level 11, everyone else had Flash apart from me. I was at a huge disadvantage.\n\nI do know they decreased the levels, so you get Flash at level 8, but Smite and Ignite are both locked until level 10. What happens if a level 9 player gets matched against a level 10 player? Varied level matches happen.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SirSneeksAlot","date":"2016-04-18T15:17:29.789+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i think its funny reading half these posts cause the problem is not how skilled or not skilled a player is or how quick or slow someone picks up the mechanises of the game its really about the fact that it is unfair.\n\nsmite how ever complicated it may be or seem is a role spell and should be able to be taken at any lvl \ni was just in a match and we had 1 person on our team that was lvl 10+ and did not use smite, were as the other team had 2 ppl lvl 10 + and 1 of them did take smite and he knew how to jg.\n\nso add on to the fact that ppl are still learning and all that and there is a lot to take in. ( the match making should not be putting or allowing ppl over lvl 10 into matchs with under lvl 10 at least not for norm's but as alot of ppl on this topic say and i agree duo top is a bad habit there should be position tutoirials and game Etiquette tutorials ie how to call a lane and wat ever else and we see no reason the lane/position meta should be different )\n\nthey straight away had the gold advantage and xp advantage and there jg had the whole map cause the only person on the other team that could take smite and jg went teemo top i was udyr top i could have jg but i'm lvl 7 and can't have smite yet and as for the runes and masters well your playing against ppl that have just as much a lack of them as you so that evens out.\n\ni would also like to add that i believe there are ppl out there that could clear jg at lvl 3 ( why don't you try make a custom game use no runes and no masters and have a go i bet you may be surprised)","replies":[]},{"poster":"shadecrapper","date":"2015-08-27T12:24:13.677+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It doesnt make much sense to me, why not have these lvl's to play around with while you are trying to figure stuff out.

If they're smart, they'll know how useful they are in the future. \n\nI saw an adc take cleanse into a tournament match and walk out with a triple kill because he got stunned and exhausted at the same time and utterly clutched it.\n\nI like taking ghost on some junglers for epic ganks because jungler flash isn't as important as laners' flash.\n\nBarrier is a counter to ignite.\n\nExhaust can be used both offensively and defensively, and its utility can really aid in a teamfight. But midlaners seem to forget that while ignite is useful, exhaust *lowers defenses, damage, and movement speed which can also help you snowball during the laning phase.*\n\nBut that's just my two cents.","replies":[]}]}
