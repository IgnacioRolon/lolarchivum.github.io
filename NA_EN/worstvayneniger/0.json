I expected to get an email with a link to the Tribunal decision. When I log in, it shows one game; where I was very toxic. I&#039;d like to see the other games, unless something has changed and you can get punished for a single game (I haven&#039;t actually participated in the Tribunal for a few years now).  My gf had broken up with me, and I drank entirely too much vodka that night; but, I&#039;d like to see what I said.\r\n\r\nI apparently wasn&#039;t as smart as the duo in the one game that shows up when I log in... that is, I don&#039;t flame in pre&amp;post lobby and spam pings at people and run to their lane to steal cs to tilt them: Since that wouldn&#039;t get me banned because there&#039;s no evidence of it on the Tribunal. Additionally, I find it odd that you guys don&#039;t do temp bans. I had a chat restriction a few months ago, and then this perma ban. (I think I had a chat restriction over a year ago, as well). tbh had I known I could get perma&#039;d I would have probably played something else, that&#039;s less tilting... or made a new account; but I expected I would get a temp ban before getting perma&#039;d.\r\n\r\nCheers.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Tantram","date":"2016-12-02T22:08:56.943+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot Games has a zero tolerance policy for  racism/hate speech and it is what lead to a direct perma-ban in your case.

From what I can remember, one of them typed kys multiple times after I picked my champ. But, of course, that wouldn't show up in the logs. However, they also said something along the lines of \"say it again %%%got\" after I typed kys after being spam pinged for 10 mins. So, drunk me typed it two more times.","replies":[{"poster":"LostFr0st","date":"2016-12-02T22:45:12.711+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Each person is responsible for their own actions in game.\nWhat that duo typed would be considered for their respective punishments, not yours.","replies":[{"poster":"WorstVayneNiger","date":"2016-12-02T22:48:35.302+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I get that.
