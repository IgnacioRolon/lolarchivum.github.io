YES i know i7 is recommended for streaming but im on a budget so i want to know if the i5 6500 or i5 6600k is enough for streaming or not. \r\nNote I am only gonna stream League,CS:GO and maybe Overwatch. All of these games will be running on a gtx 1070 so frame loss while streaming wont be an issue in 1080p. Is there any other problems i might have with an i5 for streaming?","replies":[{"poster":"TractorFarm","date":"2016-12-16T06:16:40.349+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The biggest difference between i5 and i7 is hyperthreading and cache size.

The CPU load for streaming is only dependent on what quality you want your stream to be at which any streaming software (OBS, XSPLIT etc.) should recommend a setting for your processor. I know Xsplit does 8)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-15T17:35:56.172+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Every PC is different, so I couldn't make any guarantees.
