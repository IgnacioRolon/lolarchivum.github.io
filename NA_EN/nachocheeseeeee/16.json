My guess is that he will be an AP mage, but I guess it&#039;s too early to be judging. Btw, I have reason to believe that Aurelion Sol&#039;s lore will have connection to Leona&#039;s lore, since Aurelion Sol translates to golden sun, which pretty much exemplifies Leona. My guess is that he is the deity she worships, or maybe a high servant of her god. Probably he will be enemies with Diana, and look down upon Shyvana. Also maybe he will have a rivalry with Azir, due to the golden disc being associated with the golden sun. Cool fact, he still retains the same initials as Ao Shin.","replies":[]}
