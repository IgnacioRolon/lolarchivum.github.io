I cannot move my mouse at all to direct it to the box either. I tried adjusting my screen's resolution from my desktop but even if I match it to the in-game resolution, it doesn't solve it (in fact this makes my desktop screen smaller since the recommended resolution is 3840 X 2160 (UHD). I've been told that League doesn't support UHD (4K or whatever you wanna call it), but I managed to play some games with the UHD resolution both adjusted in my screen and in League (yes there was an available option), but my mouse cursor, chat, and map became significantly small too (even if they were in max). Out of nowhere, one day my screen becomes zoomed in that I cannot do anything to fix it because my in game screen is very zoomed in. There were some signs here and there that there could be a potential issue with my new 4k resolution laptop and League as every time I tabbed out, the taskbar on my screen would stretch up even if it was locked. This problem is really annoying and I don't know anyone who can fix it. I cannot play at all :(. Anyone know what exactly the core issue is and how I can go about on fixing it? I'm not sure, but I've been told to adjust the in game resolution from an external source, but I don't know how to.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-26T23:44:50.766+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"As *Porocles* mentioned in your previous post, we don't have full support for UHD (4k) displays yet. In your case, I believe there may be issues with your input settings as a whole. Below are the steps to take in order to reset your input settings on the server.\n\nFirst, you'll want to **log into the game** then hop into **a custom game**. *Alt+Tab* out of the match, then navigate to your config folder, which should be in your install directory:\n\n>**C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config**\n\n>Delete these two files:\n\n>**- input.ini**\n**- PersistedSettings.json**\n\nOnce you've deleted these two files, leave the match, then hop into another one to confirm the changes went through. Let me know if this worked.","replies":[]}]}
