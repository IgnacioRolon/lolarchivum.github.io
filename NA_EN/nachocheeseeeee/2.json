I tried hitting the maximize button but it was blanked out as not a possible option around the edge of the League windows, and so I couldn't play my game well. Had to literally zoom my face into my screen to farm. I don't know what happened after that. I restarted my computer and the problem was still there. I went to task manager and clicked on a maximize option for League, and now my display size is screwed up. I click some where in the map, and it doesn't go necessarily in that direction indicating that the size of the display I'm seeing is not compatible with the actual location the game detects. I tried login in again, in a custom game (this happened in my ranked game sadly), and now it shows some weird graphics I cannot fix. It cut off my side edges of the screen (the windows is now in full screen but the right and left edges are cut off so I can only see a portion of it), and I cannot adjust my display settings to suit this windows size because the box is too big for me to drag down to click okay. Help me Riot. Why did this technical issue suddenly occur out of nowhere when I touched nothing.","replies":[{"poster":"Meriipu","date":"2016-09-20T14:28:33.558+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"try opening the game.cfg file in \"Riot Games/League of Legends/Config\"\n\nand change the three lines in the [General] section to:\n\nWindowMode=2\nHeight=1200\nWidth=1920\n\nor whatever your resolution is\n\nWindowMode=2 means borderless I think, or it means windowed.

So I was able to get the in game resolution to match my desktop's UHD resolution (3840 X 2160) by tabbing out from the game (the resolution League automatically sets itself into is , while my desktop automatically sets itself into the lowest resolution 640 X 480) and minimizing the internet window to be able to right click on my desktop and set the desktop resolution back to 3840 X 2160. This made my screen full screen, and the league window became small. I then tried to tab back into League, and match the resolution to 3840 X 2160 (note that there was an *, which I'm guessing was a warning that it doesn't support or recommend such high resolution). The League screen also became full screen and matched the resolution to my desktop (only downside from playing with this resolution is that the inventory boxes, option boxes, etc and mouse cursor are extremely small so it is hard to play around that). Either way it seemed that the problem was fixed, until I tabbed out again, and my desktop resolution went back to 640 X 480 automatically. I tabbed back into League, and the resolution stayed the same (3840 X 2160). I don't know what is causing this issue, but I did see early signs of tabbing out from League causing some issues on my desktop (for example, the taskbar would stretch up on its own when it was locked from doing such stretchings). Is it just that my computer's resolution is not compatible with League's resolution? I want to play in 4K resolution because my computer screen is not full otherwise. Is there a possible way to still be playing League without any resolution issues?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-20T18:06:47.926+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you might have a series of issues here that could be ranging from driver, game file, or even hardware problems.
