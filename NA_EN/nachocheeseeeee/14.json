They literally do the same thing. Run into an enemy and hopefully win trade by out-statting them. Not to mention, in team fights, they just simply can&#039;t run to the back line with the amount of heavy CC, mobility, and utility there is in the game. They are supposed to be juggernauts who can take damage and CC for the team, but unlike {{champion:122}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:420}}, they lack the armor penetration to chunk tanks  and don&#039;t have an execution ult.  So even if they have the tankiness of a tank At best they are better for split pushing and clearing waves once they have {{item:3077}} (Udyr doesn&#039;t really need it though). {{champion:39}}, on the other hand, at least has a resettable dash mechanic with a tenacity passive to reach the back line, and a 2 second stun that is generally more game changing than anything in Udyr&#039;s kit. I also think {{champion:80}} could use a rework. All these champs are much more linear and binary than Irelia personally.","replies":[{"poster":"Naalith","date":"2017-10-26T00:28:54.107+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, on Meddler's post after they announced the Irelia rework I asked him why they chose her when there are so many broken (not op, but fundamentally flawed) champs that are thousands of times worse than Irelia and he basically said she's pretty popular and will bring enjoyment to lots of people, moreso than other champs.

So from my standpoint, i could no longer play her as an Assassin because any other build on her was more viable and she wasn't as squishy. Still was bad to play as her because building like a bruiser while saying \"i'm an assassin\" brought a huge disconnect between the champion i always liked.\n\nWhen her rework came, i was elated. Riot correctly identified her core pillars to keep and rebuild around which meant a lot more cohesive champion with an actual viable kit. Everything about her came together and even her skins (which were either 520 and 750 RP) didn't look cheap.\n\nThere's no point in trying to deny a VGU for your favorite champion just because you like her as she is. The majority of people want her to be better and Riot can do better. That includes people who never played her once and people who'd want to try her but don't like the current her. It also includes her mains.\n\nIf a large majority of the people want for her to get a VGU, player's satisfaction is going to be served by doing exactly that. Riot can't please everyone and they shouldn't even try. What they can do is to make sure that they don't destroy Irelia's core personality and something in her kit that makes her \"HER\" so that her small \"no change\"  fanbase doesn't trash her after her VGU.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SteelMankind","date":"2017-10-26T16:45:35.049+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pretty sure thatbmost Irelia players recognize that aside from Q, the champion is a ball of stats that has some unfair mechanics (E stun).

Im sure whatever they come up with (as long as it is appropriately thematic) will be better for everyone.\n\nQ- Will probably stay in some respect.\n\nW- Not sure what will happen with this skill, I can see the passive staying, maybe \"Hiten Style\" Will be come her new passive, I dunno.\n\nE- This mechanic is not one that I particularly care for. If the stun duration was based on the difference in HP, I think it would be more interesting, but the long duration stun for simply having less than 1% less max hp than your opponent is unfun in my opinion. I see this skill probably getting changed, though I assume she will still have some kind of cc in her kit.\n\nR- This ability is interesting, but I think it could be better.\n\nOverall, I think that if Irelia keeps her agile fighter feel, the old player base will largely be happier with the reworked version.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Xonra","date":"2017-10-26T03:21:46.687+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":4,"body":"Their logic is so flawed sometimes.

So it stands to reason why not a lot of people are gunning to see him VGU'd even if Riot can make him 100x better and more cool looking than he currently is.\n\nChampions that show great promise in thematics (even if their gameplay doesn't) are always more likely to be at the top of the list.
