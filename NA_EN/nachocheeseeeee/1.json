My resolution is set at 3840 X 2160 since it is the highest possible resolution (might as well go for it), and when I launched League and log in, my screen's resolution is fine (the screen size does not change, and looks normal). However, every time I start a game while loading, the resolution completely changes on its own. I have the side (left and right) borders trimmed by black screens. The images are more zoomed in (the setting box in League is so zoomed in, I cannot change the resolution from there as I cannot drag my mouse to click the options). I have tried reconnecting my game, restarting my laptop, maximizing the screen size in League with the task bar manager, and even uninstalling and reinstalling the game (took about 45 min of my time) all to realize that none of these methods helped fix the problem. At this point I don't know how to fix the problem, and it might perhaps be not from the game itself but my computer. I am not sure if Riot you will be able to help me, but I am writing this as a last resort hoping you will be helpful. Something I noticed in my computer is that every time I tab out (alt + TAB) to see other windows in my computer while playing League, after the game finishes, my taskbar (which already was in locked form) stretches itself upwards (widens up), and it states it is in locked form. I don't know how it stretches on its own because it shouldn't be able to do that when it is in locked form. Also, ever since I got this new 4K resolution laptop, the mouse cursor size in the game has become significantly smaller. This definitely affected my performance in the game as it was hard to last hit for farming and redirecting my mouse to attack enemies or move certain areas. I'm not sure if my resolution of my laptop is compatible with League, but please I would greatly appreciate it if someone from Riot with an expertise in these technical issues could help. Thank you.\n\nAlso I just realized one more thing. When I try to tab out from League (after the resolution changes to something lesser than UHD, it changes to 1280 X 720 to be specific, and the it is windowed), the background/main window is League itself not the desktop (you know when you tab out from any windows weather your internet browser, skype, game etc, the background tab should be the desktop).","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-20T17:49:26.239+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"We don't currently support 4K, and you will likely have issues like this.  My suggestion would be to decrease your in-game and monitor resolutions, and try not to tab out of game whenever possible.  Reducing that will be your best chance for a normal experience.  Good luck!","replies":[]}]}
