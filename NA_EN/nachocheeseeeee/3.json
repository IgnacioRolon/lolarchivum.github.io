It's so small that it tends to blend with the background, making it hard for me to find it. I tried changing resolutions, but it is still the same size. Is there a way to change the size of the mouse cursor because when I first started playing on this computer, the size of it was just fine.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-06T16:01:27.243+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you playing at a resolution higher than 1920x1200? Most resolutions like 4K or anything close to it will have UI scaling issues on certain configurations because we don't have full 4K support at the moment. A lot of players using high resolutions can run just fine if using Full Screen and avoid **alt+tabbing** during the match.\n\nIn some cases, you'll need to set your Windows and In-game resolution to something like 1920x1200 or 1920x1080 in order for the UI to scale properly at all. Let me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}
