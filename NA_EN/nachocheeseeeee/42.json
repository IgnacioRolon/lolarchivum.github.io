Other that probably come into mind are {{champion:23}} and if built glass cannon with enough attack speed and life steal {{champion:19}} {{champion:266}}. I remember old {{champion:69}}, when she had her AP amplifying passive, used to be able to 1v1 baron, and I think released {{champion:268}} also had the range to kill Baron without even being touched as he outranged it. \n\nAnyway, ho else do you think can 1v1 Baron and Elder Dragon?
