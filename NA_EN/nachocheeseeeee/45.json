In a way, I feel like jax needs a slight rework that will buff him to make him more relevant in team fights, but not a super buff to the point of bringing back beta Jax. Pantheon could also use a rework to make him more relevant to late game. I feel like both these champs are very outdated in terms of mechanics and kit. Pretty easy and straightforward champs without much mobility or outplay potential.","replies":[]}
