I am guessing that change you are speaking of is not an actual change, its most likely a tool tip fix so that its clear that Cleanse doesn't work on Suppression.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Toxic Memes","date":"2016-12-01T18:39:20.487+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That site interpreted the change incorrectly.
