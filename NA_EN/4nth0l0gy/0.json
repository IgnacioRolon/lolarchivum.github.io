For a nightmare, his R is the only really terror-inducing part of his kit.\n\nI'm no expert, but as scary as a big shady figure slowly drifting toward you can be, I think it'd be way more frightening to suddenly have an impending fear icon appear over your head out of nowhere (\"I FORGOT TO WARD!\" You scream). I mean sure, you can fire a blind skillshot in hopes of hitting him, but chances are you're going to panic and run...even if he was actually BEHIND YOU THE WHOLE TIME, MUAHAHAHA. \n\nTo me, that's TOTALLY what {{champion:56}} is all about. Screw spell shields, they're dinky little one-and-dones. I'd rather have a cool engage/escape tool, with some true vision counterplay that makes you feel like you're hunting down Freddy Krueger with a vial of holy water. \n\n{{champion:56}}'s not a burst champion, unlike {{champion:254}} or {{champion:59}}; he's supposed to feel like he's impending, creeping along in the corners of your mind. A brief stint of invisibility accomplishes that with style, without making him overpowered. If he really wants to go for the kill, he still has to destealth to use his Q, but his approach would be much more psychological than that of his currently stronger jungle counterparts.\n\nI think invisibility could be a great way to enhance {{champion:56}}'s theme, make his kit feel more cohesive, and still allow for fair counterplay.\n\n~\n\nEdit**: I don't suppose, since this thread has gotten a bit of attention, a Rioter on the design or balance team might want to chime in on their thoughts on {{champion:56}}? I'd be curious to hear if there are any plans to change him up in the near future.","replies":[{"poster":"Ultîma","date":"2015-03-15T19:05:05.739+0000","up_votes":40,"down_votes":0,"body":"I definitely feel as though Nocturne is a bit of a relic in terms of champion design, art wise he looks amazing but I certainly wish he'd deliver more on the idea of being a nightmarish shade. I actually feel that something along the line of Kha'zix' flicker-stealth would really make Nocturne's approach terrifying. \n\nI had also seen a thread somewhere saying that vision control is Nocturne's biggest strength (Paranoia), and having his other abilities represent that would help his kit feel a little more cohesive. The E channel could gradually reduce the target's vision until they are feared, at which point they would see nothing beyond their immediate surroundings like Graves' smokescreen. \n\nAnother idea that I saw (that didn't get nearly as much attention) was that Nocturne would stealth on his dusk-trail. I thought this would be interesting in terms of making plays/counterplay because you have a very defined area in which Nocturne can be invisible where he can bait skillshots or pose a threat. Depending on how skillful he is, or if he manages to hit multiple enemies in a teamfight, Nocturne then becomes this very scary assassin that can cover a lot of ground and hit the priority targets where it hurts. \n\nOverall I feel that making Nocturne feel less like a generalist, and more of a wraith would turn him into an amazing character.","replies":[{"poster":"4nth0l0gy","date":"2015-03-15T19:08:31.713+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like the idea of vision denial with E.

That might be something worth considering if changes were made to his kit. For example, maybe when he E's a target, he could have even more movespeed approaching them if the target is marked with duskbringer, BEFORE the tether popped its fear. Or perhaps he could acquire an ethereal state for a couple seconds after he uses the dash on his R, making him invulnerable to crowd control (not my idea, but a good one).\n\nMy major problem with the shield is that it doesn't feel very thematic, which is why I single it out.","replies":[{"poster":"Troy242621","date":"2015-03-15T18:41:59.053+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":1,"body":"Then they can fling a CC skill at you and walk off spamming laugh because his only decent mobility is on a long cooldown.

Pop ult, press R, appear next to them, and then,...Go invisible instead of CC lock or deal damage?,...Yuck. I like his spellshield.\n\nAs for thematics, it's perfectly thematic. He attacked people in their dreams because there, their magic couldn't work. He came out of a Nexus from a magical explosion.

However, Nocturne's strength has never really been teamfighting, it has been ganking and making picks. The problem with that core identity right now, of course, is that Nocturne is really easy to spot coming, which makes ganking with him pre-6 very difficult. Sure, his shield lets him stay on a target once he's there, but good luck getting in without being spotted. As a result, the player has a very small window of time to help their lanes get ahead, making him much less interactive with other champions than he ought to be.\n\nI'm sacrificing his spell shield with the hope of making him more effective on the approach when his ult is not available. Again, even if you don't like the particular ones I've suggested, I'm certain there are other changes that could be made to compensate him for the loss. I think spellshields are more of a tool to counter engages, whereas Nocturne definitely does the engaging.","replies":[{"poster":"Troy242621","date":"2015-03-15T18:53:42.913+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"I dunno.

I've always felt this way, especially when he was released.\n\nHe is a champ who had a gap closer, hard cc, spell shield, ad steroid, as steroid, aoe damage, passive healing, poke, MASSIVE gap closer engage, total map vision debuff, and sustained damage...\n\nThe math behind it was crazy to.  What do you get when you give a champ BOTH an AD and AS steroid?  Freekin hyper carry, not assassin.  YI  and Noct both had ad and as steroids, but noct got a spell shield, gap closer, and hard cc.  Imagine if Yi's alpha strike included a stun, even for 0.5 seconds lol.\n\nThat was just too much.  He needed a rework.  He still needs one.\n\nShould they add stealth?  tbh I really like the idea of him being stealthed on his dusk trail, but not stealthed in general.  In this way his stealth would be more akin to akali than wu kong or twitch.  Imagine if he was simply always stealthed along his dusk trail...  It adds in a telegraph so he wouldn't need fade time, but gives him the mind game if you not knowing where on the trail he is.  Also as mentioned if he were to hit 2+ people this would really increase his mind game potential without drastically changing his power levels.  I think this could be a great idea.  He would blip in and out when he used abilities or auto attacked, and the real fear is that people wouldn't always know if he was actually on their trail or not!  You're running away from him in the jungle and he decides to disengage, but your allies see the trail on you and need to decide quickly if he's still there or not!  The time the trail follows a champ and the rate it disappears would be reduced too, tune it similar to akali's shroud.\n\nHe could join the ranks of Vi and Akali as an endless chaser champ by improving the utility of his trail, maybe give him charges and nuke it's projectile damage to null.  Pure utility but he could shoot out maybe 2 or even 3 trails in succession (like vel kox).  Of course he would still keep his AD boost while on the trail, but in this way he has chase continually renewed by skill shots allowing some counter play.  You could put the actual cd of the skill high too so a few dodges or early uses would render nocturne much less able to chase giving game play to both sides.\n\nHere's the thing - now we thin out the tankyness as a trade off.  Make it so that if he's caught he is dead.\n\nI see noct as best played from the jungle, so we could leave in some amount of sustain, but design it to be more of a refill between combat, NO burst sustain for in combat.  I'm thinking give him an ability that is life steal always, but activated to trade life steal for attack speed.  Lose your sustain for increased damage.  If the cd of the ability is high, then the as bonus could be high.  Basically I would want to allow him to keep his sustain as long as it's TRADED for damage, not in addition to.","replies":[{"poster":"Newb the Legend","date":"2015-03-16T13:54:27.158+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Here's the thing - now we thin out the tankyness as a trade off.

I think he has and identity crisis, he plays like an assassin but builds like a bruiser otherwise he can't dish out his damage in time.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"revliledpembroke","date":"2015-03-16T13:08:52.874+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm sure Karthus mains everywhere love this idea","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pæan","date":"2015-03-16T03:50:33.209+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was excited to read \"but what if.......... he shot fricken laser beams from his head\"?!\n\nBut i guess this is cool too.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zendrô","date":"2015-03-16T00:46:44.752+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"can we replace Sivir's spellshield too then?","replies":[{"poster":"4nth0l0gy","date":"2015-03-16T00:58:39.557+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like Sivir's spellshield, actually. I think it makes sense gameplay-wise, as she is a ranged champion (she has a more reasonable amount of time to react to abilities given her normal distance from the action), and also because she is a champion that excels at counter-engage with her ultimate.\n\nThematically...yeah, it's also a little shaky. But I think fits her playstyle better than it does Noc's.","replies":[]}]}]}
