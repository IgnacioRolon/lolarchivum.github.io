If Lee misses his Q he's meant to be out of luck but he can instead just wardhop over and catch you with E anyway. His kick is meant to be immensely powerful if you can flank an opponent, but wardhops let you completely avoid the need to flank and allow you to kick an opponent back without putting much effort into your position.\n\nWardhops also allow him to invalidate immobile squishy champs altogether as if he ever lands a Q onto them he can jump behind them and kick them out of their team and they just don't get any option or play to make, it just becomes flash or die.","replies":[]},{"poster":"4nth0l0gy","date":"2015-01-28T03:46:31.443+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hm.

Lee Sin has two abilities to re-position (three if you count is his ult). I've been playing Katarina since day 1 and ward hopping successfully (ward hopping at all) is what separate good and bad Katarinas. Shunpo is flash jump from Bleach - it's thematically fitting to be able to jump to wards, lanterns, minions, or J4's spear. Shunpo simply means blinking from place to another if there's a waypoint. Just like Jax's jump, you're jumping a target than can be jumped on. Katarina is a feast or famine champion. If she's getting kills like she's supposed to be, then she'll have the extra gold to purchase wards. If not, it's more likely that she'll rely on her trinket. Like I said, ward hopping separates good and baddies. Yes wards give Katarina a second chance at living and re-positioning, but whether or not they use it to their advantage or throw it away is another story. The starving Kat will have to either use the trinket to help the team or help herself. I buy about 16-18 wards per game; that's 1200 gold if I bought 16.  Katarina doesn't have a decent early game at all, so all of you who are complaining about the trinket giving Kat an immense power -- you need to play Katarina yourself at mid. It's perfectly fine the way it is. She gets bullied in lane easily, she's also item dependent - leaving no spare gold for wards. Whether the Kat uses the trinket to ward the bush or save it for a Shunpo requires good judgment from playing Kat. Ward hopping also punishes greedy enemy teams when they should be pushing rather than chasing, offering counter play.\n\nRegarding Lee Sin's ward hopping option, it doesn't make sense. Also the user that said if Lee can hop a ward, why can't Lulu shield a ward? Because it doesn't make sense to shield a ward for either Lee Sin or Lulu. Lulu is in lane with the adc and minions for the most part of the game. Positioning Pix on minions or enemy champions isn't impossible. If you can't position Pix well yet, that means you haven't played Lulu long enough to position properly. \n\nFor those who really dig Pix, one of the changes I'd make with Lulu's Q (GlitterLance) is that reduce all of Q's effects by half (CD, mana, slow, damage). What's the compensation? Her Q shoots Pix into the targeted area. Pix grants vision and whatnot. The short CD will allow you to fire off Q again. I also believe this follows with Lulu's tag team theme with Pix. Re-position Pix back and forth to harass and slow. You should be shielding an allied minion or champion, not a ward. \n\nOverall, ward hopping is fun and adds a nice niche to the game and champions. Honestly, complaining about ward hopping will only screw the game in the end because the more we strip kits, the way we win will become more binary. (League method of winning is already binary in itself since Season 5) When talking about balancing, adding, or removing, please consider the bigger picture rather than your frustration.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Red Warden","date":"2015-01-28T06:03:04.453+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"They could just make it so that they can still ward-hop but only to wards that were placed by an ally and not themselves.

Very few champions have the ability to counter multiple engages so the answer is mostly no when it is used as an engage. When used as an escape it is actually slightly less good than other dashes and has just as much if not slightly more counterplay than other escapes.\n\nDo ward hops add depth for both the player using it to chase/escape AND the player being chased/chasing? When a champion is using ward hops to chase/engage it adds absolutely zero depth for the champion getting the ward hop used against him and in fact reduces game play depth because you can dodge Lee's Q but not his ward hop and it also reduces the depth for the Lee Sin player using it since it reduces the meaningful choices he has to make on the fly, assuming he is using his trinket and not a purchased ward, and also because it cannot be dodged.
