We tried hard on WoW not to \"save players from themselves,\" and on the occasions when we did I'm not convinced it ended up well. One result of this philosophy is we gave third-party mods great latitude in how they re-sculpted the UI of the game. It's clear many players enjoyed the ability to customize or express themselves, and it's probably also fair that the default UI didn't provide all of the information it needed to (which is why we're having the conversation about jungle timers for League). \n\nOn the other hand, it's one of those great power comes great responsibility deals. I always felt the boss addons for WoW for example frequently provided way too much information just because they could. (Sure they were customizable and players could turn off things they didn't strictly need, but I'm not sure how many made that effort.)  When your HUD resembles that of a commercial airliner, it's hard to know what are the bits as a player that you actually need to pay attention to. Does that mean we should have stepped in and tried to prevent the over-UI-ification of the game? I'm not sure. Thoughts?\n\nI know slippery slope arguments are a potent weapon in the arsenal of the internet, but that doesn't mean League add-ons have to go this route either. We think there is room for a lot of improvement in the default UI of League, and we want to support and offer guidance to third-parties who want to do their own thing. How do we all (and I'm purposely including you guys here) know when things go too far and the add-ons cross over into garish or bloated constructs that bury players in barely-useful displays?*\"\n\n\n\n\nMy response:\n\nI see your concern for the UI clutter, but really the major concern should be the fact that allowing addons is gonna change an UI that has been so far a fair playing field for most people. What is fair to be automated by an addon and what is considered a skill in LoL cannot be plainly shown to everyone so that everyone can agree (map awareness, las hitting, skill timers, jungle timers, damage calculation, etc.) So i don't think any arbitrary opinion based on a experience of the game should decide this, so everyone should get the same UI options (meaning an official UI and no addons from third parties)  \n\nThis is not just a slippery slope argument I'm talking about curse voice that is allowed already:\n\nIf riot and the majority of the community want the allied ult timers that CV provides , then everyone should have them by default in their UI,same with voice chat that's easy to access for random teams in soloque (obviously with the option to turn on and off). Letting addons provide such useful information and tools will skew the fair playing field. \n\nAlso you should know all the trouble addons can cause bugs and problems keeping up with the official game updates and having to uninstall them when you run into bugs but this is just secondary point with my main one being enough reason to stay away from them.\n\nedit: why do html format commands don't work?","replies":[{"poster":"Ghostcrawler","date":"2014-04-23T22:55:46.223+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gostcrater?

I made an advanced one if it is wanted.  \n---  \nAs this is a public discussion I would suggest to link the post where Ghostcrawler said this so we (well, me at least) aren't just taking your word for it.\n---\nmy $0.02: \nLet's use voice chat as an example. It's a clear strategic advantage, LoL does not have it default and it's actually a (imho) horrible idea to be implemented for numerous reasons which I can go into in detail if wanted. To get around this a lot of players use Skype and other 3rd-party voice sharing services to communicate. While this does give a small advantage everyone on the call is (I'm assuming) on the same team and has access to the exact same information so they cannot glean anything they couldn't have by themselves in the exact same moment it just makes it easier to relay across the board.\n\nCV does the same thing but automated. From what I understand of CV it does not advise a course of action or otherwise direct you anywhere it just displays current information that the current UI also shows, it just makes it more obvious. I attribute more to like using reading glasses to read, some may flat out need it and most will eventually find them *convenient* but there are yet others who can go on without them and be perfectly fine.\n\nAnd on the side-note for updates, imo Riot should specifically not care about mod updates and their compatibility. It's the mod author's *job* to keep the mod usable. If that becomes a problem then the issue is with mod and its creators not Riot or their game.","replies":[{"poster":"Angry Monster","date":"2014-04-22T22:37:15.094+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"dragon and baron count downs are not part of the game currently. \n\nI have no problem with voice chat in general but i am irked that riot is allowing a partner to literally modify the adobe and game client.

The server options allowed for the disabling of all custom material to enforce these rules. Some leagues also made anti hack detection programs that were required on everyone's client to do detect hook ins. \n\nLeague is a ladder game therefore it is strictly competitive. You may have causal people who do not care but that does not change what the game is. Allowing mods is literally a slap in the esport (not just at riot) creditably.\n\nLeague is the NAME of national/global recognized esports.

The default UI has ult indicators to show when ally ults are available already and voice chat with random people is just not as much of an advantage as it's made out to be. Once an entire second can decide a game (imo Plat and above) players usually have enough experience to not need more than pings, the mini-map and their own in-game knowledge. \n\nLower than that the second or two saved from CV's tools don't have nearly as much of an impact in the average game. Sure there will be exceptions but when it comes to presented information influencing a decision CV does not give enough to truly impact gameplay. \n\nAgain from what I understand of CV currently, which is voice chat que and automated timers.","replies":[{"poster":"mauroc0","date":"2014-04-22T22:10:03.948+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The scope of the advantage does not really matter for my argument(and it is a matter of opinion and that's part of the main problem I'm criticizing too) the advantage is there , however small according to you, i differ, because my argument criticizes the principle. \n\nThere are on/off indicators very different from countdown timers that take into account ultimate level and CDR, imo you can't keep track of the 5 ultis in that fashion mentally, with all the other information you have to process, so it is an advantage that can't be achieved without the addon.\n\nI disagree about voice chat too, i think it is the one of the main reasons why premades usually beat randoms, and in LoL we have a different queue for premades and duos in soloque get an inflated MMR.\n\nAlso saying that unskilled players would not reap the advantages of the tools and information this addons provide does not affect my argument either(cause they are still there and people are going to want them and other people that see others using them will want them too and so the mods arm race begins) Also i think it is debatable, I think the ultimate timers will help low skill people a lot, like me in silver.","replies":[{"poster":"Hyrum Graff","date":"2014-04-24T04:39:40.233+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm S5.

I intended to say that on average the advantage gained in lower elo would not be enough to decide a game's outcome if the add-on did not come into play.  \n\nVoice chat is very debatable but branching off into a related, but already popularly discussed topic. Some people want it and some people don't, I respect your view and understand it but I'll agree to disagree.  \n\nOverall, I think I'm just trying to argue a separate point and I haven't been clear about it, I'm sorry about that. I agree that add-ons like CV that better represent 'earned information' give an advantage, but I simply disagree it is a significant enough advantage to worry about it. In my eyes you can still function on the same level without it against someone with it as long as the add-on does not give you information you would not normally have. Even precision information like exact ult cooldowns are still good under that because the number of times where those 5 secs or so (the time when knowing an ult's exact refresh time will be a true advantage against the current UI) will affect a decision come up very, very rarely.","replies":[]},{"poster":"mauroc0","date":"2014-04-22T22:37:09.576+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a response i gave from a conversation on the forums with someone with a similar point of view as you Sir ArmaMalum:\n\nI think CV is going to become the standard in ranked soloqueue, i think the voice chat and the ally ult timers that take into account ult levels and CDR, which are much better than the green on/off dots, are good enough to cause it to become widely spread and finally the standar mod. I have always trusted riot judgement like you seem to do, but the recent responses from rioters in this topic has shaken my trust sadly. I'm still waiting for are reasonable address of all the valid complains the community has put forward. I really hope they monitor the MMR of the people using this vs not using it and disable it if it affects it even if it is not something big, and i think it will affect it. And eventually add this features to their UI if they deems it a good thing.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
