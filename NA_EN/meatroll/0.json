Wouuuuuuuuuuuhouuuuuu! Yeah! :)\n\n\nNo offense dude, it's just that this forum is new so I was woundering when those things would happen. I can't blame you for posting this, it's just that lol forums tend to get a lot.... A LOT.... **A LOT** of those kinda post. (waiting for 'blah blah is op', 'why am I banned?',etc)\n\n\nTo be more constructive I really like those \"loss prevented\" when the servers got issues and I wounder if **Riot is working on a kind of automated program** that finds out if a server/game has connection issues then automatically apply LE famous \"loss prevented\".","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2013-09-18T22:43:51.431+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Kajika91,\n\nI saw your message, and I just wanted to touch on this extremely quickly.  Keep in mind that we do have an entire team dedicated to tracking when server issues are occurring. For instance, letâ€™s say they notice trends in dropped games 1 minute after they occur, and immediately enable Loss Prevented. Not only is this incredibly fast, but since around 10 games are created over each second, that means around 600 games were created in that time.  That means close to 6,000 players experienced an issue with the server crashing and will unfortunately not receive the loss prevented.  \n\nI completely understand how shitty of an experience this can be, and this is why we very closely monitor the health of our game servers and try to press \"the button\" as soon as we can confirm such server issues.  I know nothing I say will restore these games, or the LP lost, but I hope I can at least shed some light on this issue.","replies":[{"poster":"Super Pedo Panda","date":"2013-09-19T17:39:41.114+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"how about applying this to normal games or at least stop being such dicks about it? i got banned for \"abandoning my team\" even though its pretty obvious that i tried and succeded in joining back and trying to be a good teammate. ofc i suppose thats impossible with the customer support that riot has. riot customer support summed up in a few words - uncooperative, offensive/rude, absolutly no help, doesnt care about your problems - so congrats for having worst cust support NA","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2013-09-19T18:25:10.030+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Getting banned by the Leaver Buster System can be incredibly aggravating.  However, please keep in mind that the system only suspends people who demonstrate consistent behavior in leaving games.  We all experience technical issues (even I have lost soloqueue games due to random issues), and this is why we never ban people who left only a couple games.  It takes that consistent pattern of leaves or being AFK before the system issues a suspension.\n\nWhile I know that your leaves are not intended, please keep in mind that you are still consistently ruining the gaming experience of up to 9 other players by not being in the game.  It is for this reason that the system temporarily suspends you.\n\nTo that end, when experiencing these kinds of issues, make sure that you try to contact us here in Player Support immediately!  We can work with you to get the necessary information to prevent this from occurring in the future.","replies":[{"poster":"Super Pedo Panda","date":"2013-09-23T15:59:12.052+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"did u not read the whole thing i just said? its not like i just dc and say \"fuck it im too much of a toxic player to log back in and hel my team out\" i know how infuriating it is when u have a dcer on ur team. however, i dont rage or report them if they return to the game and give it their all to catch up to the team and fix their \"mistake\" i suppose u could call it. u srsly need to fix it where people that return and actually try dont get punished and have their time wasted cause their someone trying to log back in and not ruin the game for 9 others.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"hearts4pandas","date":"2013-09-18T20:09:20.881+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah we just had our entire team dc as well as 4 out of 5 of the enemy's team dc.
