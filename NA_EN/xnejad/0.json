A couple of weeks ago, I started noticing that my framerate was dropping and that I would occasionally \"lose control\" of my champion, meaning that the game would not register my move clicks and stay stuck for 2-3secs but I could steel use spells, chat, see what others are doing. I sent a ticket to Riot and we discovered that the issue comes from packet loss. This suprises as I have a high quality ethernet connection (90+ mbps download and upload as well as 18ms ping in game). Hellp!!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-08-17T20:46:47.248+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That loss of control doesn't feel good, but packet loss could be fixed with the steps in the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide.
