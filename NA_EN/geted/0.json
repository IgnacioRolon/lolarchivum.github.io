I know many players saw this potential problem coming, so it's not unreasonable to assume that Rioters did as well. \n\nI understand that the developers are working on this problem ASAP, and I'm not that interested in who's to blame or what caused the miscommuniction (if any). Still, someone screwed up here, and it's causing problems for the player base. This is an amateur mistake, one that Riot needs to be more transparent about and be proactive in addressing.","replies":[]}]}]}
