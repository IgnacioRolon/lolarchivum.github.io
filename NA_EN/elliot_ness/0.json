I thought it would be a bad change, but I didn&#039;t think it would be this bad. I have played maybe 2 Aram games since the change, because it negatively effects the game play so much that it is no longer enjoyable. I have always had minor frustrations with problems in all game modes. For example of Aram problems, the fact that people roll for a new champ 2 times, then don&#039;t like what they got, so they dodge and the game refunds both of their rolls and yet you get stuck with a worse champ or team of champs then you have before that player dodged. But all these problems with all game modes have been minor issues that I can easily look past. This Mark/dash is not something I can simply look past, It needs removed from the game.\r\n\r\nI have had read almost every single post on the forums in regard to this topic and it seems overwhelming in favor to remove the spell and that is why I started this poll. I can also say to those who say &quot;If it&#039;s removed then Aram goes right back to poke comps win and tanks sit there and die&quot;, that is not true. I can honestly say, yes it sucks to go against a 5 man poke comp in Aram and most of the time that may result in a loss, but there is many factors at play for a loss to become the end result in that situation. 1. When people have a better all in team before level 6 or even at level 6 (usually with the tanks), they do not all in the other team and happily sit there and get poked to death by not just the range, but the ranged teams ultimate spells. 2. You have rolls that you can use to get better champs and try to make your team well balanced to handle a poke comp or even handle another balanced team. 3. You have time in the lobby to work with fellow teammates about a strategy, like if you should all in at 6 if the enemy team is all squishy poke champs. Now you might say as many do say &quot;Dude it is Aram and I play it just for fun, I&#039;m not going to take it that serious&quot;, Well then you shouldn&#039;t care about the poke comps or the Mark/Dash spell at all either way, but for those who do care and play any game mode to try have fun and yet also win at the same time, the spell matters to them.\r\n\r\nI have friends who play nothing but Aram games and it&#039;s the number one thing they enjoy about League Of Legends and they hate this new change to the Aram game mode. I have other friends who play Aram as just a way to learn better team fighting mechanics, but with no cost of losing a Summoners Rift game for their team or just trying out new champions and learning their spells. It is kind of hard for them to learn a new ADC they have never played or how to position correctly when their team can&#039;t peel the Riven flying across half of the map through their entire team to them. Yes, they can go learn the same ADC in a Summoners Rift game and more than likely get blamed for a loss by a toxic player, or play it in a bots game most likely without their friends, because no one wants the extremely small amount of XP or IP a bots game offers without win of the day available. This was the perfect game mode to have fun, tell your team &quot;Hey never played this champ&quot; but still get a chance to learn it while trying your best to win, plus get full XP and IP for playing.\r\n\r\n I have played ranked in Platinum and almost got to Diamond, I have got hundreds of wins in classic game modes from Summoners Rift to Twisted Treeline, but i have played as much in Aram as I have any other game mode on League Of Legends, I  thoroughly enjoyed playing Aram games. Now I don&#039;t enjoy playing Aram games anymore at all and I hope the community and Riot can help me to return Aram back to its well designed original game format. Thank you for taking the time to read this and thank you even more if you took the time to vote.

People who say the spell balanced Aram for melee champs are delusional. Champs like Kennen, Fiddlestick, Blitzcrank, Amumu, Morgana etc. broken as hell with the mark/dash spell. Mark + Dash + Ult = R.I.P. any squishy team. Everyone abusing it. Either remove it for good or nerf the range and change the cd to something like 90 - 120 sec. Or let only melee champs like Garen, Darius etc. use it.

I was excited when I heard about mark/dash but I think it needs to be nerfed more. The damage transferal to majority of dmg onto dash is a good start but the CD needs to be increased. 20 seconds is just too short for such a good skill. Really it is like having Ashe's E every 20 seconds but better because it will reveal Teemo and stealthed champs in the bush, and it also does dmg (which was nerfed fortunately), and offensively it's much better than flash, and defensively it gets u back into lane to defend towers very fast or right into a team fight. i DON'T think it should be removed at all because tanks on aram really needed some love. BUT at 20 sec ppl just spam it and there is no consequence to wasting it - you get someone to burn their flash and you are happy. I would like to see at least 30 but hopefully around 60 second CD.
