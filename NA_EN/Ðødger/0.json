I ended up having my team make a remake because I can't load my game. I am currently doing a full scan on my computer to make sure there aren't any viruses. Every time I try to load my game I get the error saying \"The application is unable to start correctly (0xc0000005)\"\n\nI'd like some help ASAP as I want to play league really badly. Thanks in advance.\n\n*EDIT*:  let me also mention that I've never had any issues similar to this before. I have never had this type of issue before and nothing has changed besides me updating my windows.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-15T04:04:50.605+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmm that Windows update might have messed with the permission settings you had in place, so that now Windows isn't recognizing League as a safe program. Make sure to check that your [**permissions**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) are still setup so that League can run normally, but let me know if that doesn't help!","replies":[]}]}
