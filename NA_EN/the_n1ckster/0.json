Riot, this is absolutely unacceptable and gross incompetence on your end. Not only did my client crash during the champ select, but I was unable to rejoin the champ select upon restarting my client. I am being punished for your client being faulty. Can a solution be reached to rectify this in some way?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-07-22T22:47:50.875+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When the client crashes, it disconnects from the server, which will then disconnect from the champ select. Because the nature of a disconnection is failing to send information to the server, it looks the same as dodging, which will count as a loss in a promo series. Unfortunately, the server is not able to differentiate the type of disconnection that happened. Whether intentional or not, a disconnection from champ select will negatively impact everyone in the match and the server treats all disconnections the same. While there's no way to remove the loss from your record, there are steps that can be taken to address the root cause of the disconnection.\n\nMost of the time, a disconnection is caused by an unstable connection to the servers. Our [connection troubleshooting guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) will take you through the most common fixes for this issue. Please let me know if you still have issues after taking the steps inside of the guide.","replies":[]}]}
