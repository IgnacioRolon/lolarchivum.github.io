It all started awhile back with the now commonly known \"500 ping disconnect bug\" where i could sit there for days and never reconnect unless i closed the client and loaded back in, this happened to me several times every game i played. I was very discouraged but i enjoy the game so i wanted to believe that somebody was fixing it. (note that i have tried absolutely everything that i have come across to try and fix my problem) . For awhile it seemed to have gotten better for me but it was still happening at least once every two games.\r\n\r\nMy problem is now i can no longer reconnect to the game after closing it. I can try as many times as i want but when i open league again and click the reconnect button i will constantly get the error \"can not connect to server, check your firewall blah blah blah blah\" i have checked my firewall numerous times and there is nothing as it shouldn't be. If i constantly try i will eventually log in but i will be in the lobby and not able rejoin the game.\r\n\r\nI Don't expect to get any response to this post because i have been on the help and support boards page everyday for at least 3 weeks (when my original problem started) and have only ever seen one riot response to this problem, since then there has been no follow up. Unfortunately riot employees seem to think its the best to leave their customers in the dark on this matter (i can assure you that is the wrong choice).\r\n\r\nI have spent quite a bit of money on this game that admittedly i probably should have spent in better ways and i am extremely saddened that i have to leave this game. I do not want to risk getting banned for leaving games by continually allowing this situation to happen.\r\n\r\nAlso i couldn't help but notice that on the server status page it says you will be doing something for 12 hours on November 3rd and no one will be able to play. I may come back to see if anything has changed after that but in all honesty my expectations are low, you have given yourselves a bad name and i wouldn't be surprised if it was getting shut down for some menial problem rather than this rather large problem that so many people seem to be suffering from.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nBanath","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2014-10-29T18:49:23.487+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Hello Banath,\n\nI read through your post, and I feel extremely bad about the issues you have been having with the game.  I completely understand how frustrating this can be.  While ping in game can be due to a wide variety of issues from our end to your individual ISP, getting a Firewall/connection is a lot less common and usually indicates an issue locally on your computer.  There appears to be something that is blocking your connection from getting to our Game Server.\n\nUnfortunately, finding that \"something\" can be incredibly difficult sometimes.
