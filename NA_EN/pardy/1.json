I am a part of the 3-5% of people that operate their mouse with their left hand and this has given me a few things that i need to overcome with every game that i play.  One of those things include the fact that every single games key binds everything so that it is set up to be more convenient for the average gamer.  \r\n\r\nThis is not that big of a problem as most games including league give you the option to key bind everything to your preference.  The problem i am having has to do with the mouse buttons though.  Since my old Razer mouse died i had to pull out the good old Optical Microsoft mouse that comes with pretty much every computer ever. \r\n\r\nI have no problem switching the dominant clicker for regular everyday use but for some reason it is reverting to the traditional setup when in league.  Just for reference i will explain how i have my clickers set up for gaming:\r\n\r\nMy left clicker is what i use to move my champion around\r\nMy right clicker is what i use after hitting my Attack move key bind in order to execute the attack move\r\n\r\nWhat it is currently like and which i am unable to change it from:\r\n\r\nMy Right clicker is what it is forcing me to use in order to move my champion\r\nMy Left clicker is what it is forcing me to use in order to execute my attack move command\r\n\r\nIt may seem like a small problem for some but this is so incredibly inhibiting to my game play that i can not play the game whatsoever.  For whatever reason Riot has come up with they have made it so every single command is interchangeable except for one thing.  And that one thing is the thing that is preventing me from being able to play the game that i love.  They will not allow you to change the Champion movement command from MB2 to MB1.\r\n\r\nI am unable to play this game in the meantime while i wait for my new mouse to come in the mail.  I just hope then that i can manage to get it setup like i used to have it otherwise i will not be able to play.\r\n\r\nIf anyone has any fixes for this please let me know.  And riot please make this simple change to the key binds to allow us to swap the movement command buttons.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-30T03:30:37.717+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Damn, sorry to hear your mouse failed on you, but I hope the one on the way is a better one! Let's get this mouse button situation thing sorted. The following steps will assist you in setting your mouse buttons up for left-handed operation. \n\n**1)** First, we'll need to complete a reset of your current input settings to ensure any misconfigurations or corruptions don't carry over.\n\n- Launch League and Login\n- Minimize the game and Navigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\n- Delete the Config folder\n- Hop into a custom match to confirm all your settings have been reset to default. If so, we can move on!\n\n**2)** Hop back into the League directory you went into before and enter the **Config** folder. Open up the input.ini file with any text editor and **delete everything in that file**.\n\n**3)** Paste these commands *precisely* into the file:\n\n>[GameEvents]\nevtPlayerSelectClick = [Button 2]\nevtPlayerMoveClick = [Button 1]\nevtPlayerAttackMoveClick = [Shift] [Button 1]\nevtPetMoveClick = [Alt] [Button 1]\nevtPetReturn = [Alt] [Button 2]\n[HUDEvents]\nevtOnUIMouse1 = [Button 2]\nevtOnUIMouse2 = [Button 1]\nevtOnUIMouse3 = [Button 3]\nevntHudMoveableSelect = [Button 2]\nevtOrbitCamera = [Ctrl][Button 2]\n\nSave the changes, then hop into a custom match to confirm everything is working as you'd like. You can make any keybinding changes in-game you'd like and everything should save fine.\n\nPlease let me know if this helped!","replies":[{"poster":"Pardy","date":"2016-12-03T03:48:05.118+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've done exactly what you have said and nothing has changed from what it was before.  I appreciate you trying to help me out but it really boggles my mind that as a player I would have to go into the code myself in order to change a key bind.  Clearly it isn't working for me and i am 99% sure that I have followed your instructions without making a mistake.  \n\nIf you guys could possibly just adjust it in the next patch so that i don't have to go through this and risk a mistake on my part that would be awesome.  Or if you have a second solution I could try i would be more than willing to give that a go.  It's extremely disappointing that i can not enjoy this game after all the money i have put into it.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-04T22:24:14.818+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just wanted to confirm, since it was implied but not directly stated, during step 2, you need to still be in a custom match and simply have League minimized while you go into the League directory to make the manual modifications.","replies":[{"poster":"Pardy","date":"2016-12-05T19:05:43.121+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"OK so I am trying this whole process again. I wasn't aware I needed to be in a game of league to make this work.  I am having another issue though... I will try to explain my steps and whats happening for me.  \n\n1.  I Login to my league account\n2. I go the c drive and delete the Whole config folder\n3. I start a custom game to make sure everything was reset.  So far so good, it worked as it should up to this point\n4. I Alt Tab out of my current game and go back to my League folder on the c drive\n5. I look for the Input.ini folder inside the new Config folder but there is nothing in there by that name I only see the following folders:\n            Champions\n            Game\n            Persisted Settings\n6. Not sure what do to at this point so i create my own text document within the config folder, I name it input.ini and i copy paste the previous lines of code.  \n7. I alt tab back into the League Game that i have had open this whole time and none of the key binds have changed, MB1 is still unable to be bound.  \n\nI really appreciate you coming back to this thread and helping me troubleshoot this problem.  Anymore feedback on things i can change would be welcome.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-05T21:44:21.070+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gotcha. So between **your steps* 3 and 4, try changing ANY hotkey setting in-game. This should create an input.ini automatically that you can then edit and paste the left-handed settings in.\n\nI hope this works for you!","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Pardy","date":"2016-12-03T02:33:54.307+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry for the late reply, I have not been able to get on my computer the last few days.  I tried doing what you outlined but after I had deleted the Config folder and went back into a custom game i got a bug splat.  I tried a second time and it all worked as it should and my settings were reset.  However when i went back to the config file to find the input.ini I didn't see it.  I have decided to re-install the game and try again just in case i messed something up in the previous steps.  I'll let you know if I'm successful afterwards.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sinister Anubis","date":"2016-11-30T15:22:22.639+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I use this same exact set up for years now.
