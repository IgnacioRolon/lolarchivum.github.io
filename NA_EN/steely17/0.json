Go in with a strategy for ezreal not for adcs in general. \n\nEzreal is a caster adc not a general adc. Same as {{champion:15}}  and {{champion:42}} \n\nAlso don't trust ezreal mains when they tell you about his amazing damage, 90% of them wouldn't know great damage from shit damage or burst from sustained damage. \n\nAlso learn how wave control works and why it might be smart to ult lane minions from across the map even if they aren't at your tower.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Darius Strada","date":"2016-08-09T09:53:26.550+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He has a nice early game.

Enuff said. AP ez sucks now.\nThe ult is a good finisher tool (just like Draven's, really), but is also useful to deshove minions to save a tower. It's CD is not bad, but it has a fairly long channel/cast time, so be careful not to be CCed while ulting.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dominick Destine","date":"2016-08-09T07:44:19.334+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Here's a tip..... and a spear behind it","replies":[]}]}
