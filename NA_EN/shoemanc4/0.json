The I was like wtf how did he even get my password and all that then he said \"do u want account back\" and of course i said yes but then he said something that really got me confused and pissed, he said \"give me rp then I will give your account back\". After that a while later i messaged him back saying ok i'll give you rp just to buy time so I could try to chage my password or something, so then i tried to change my password and then i see it is changed to his email so i couldnt even change my password which really pissed me off. After that i said ok give me like 3 to 4 weeks and i will get your rp so he gave my that time so i did everything to try to get my account back someway or some how but nothing so i wanted to know if you guys could just change my password or something because i spent money and time on this game and i dont want it to go away so if you guys could just do something to get my account back that would mean everything.\r\n\r\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-03T22:10:57.599+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This sounds like a shady situation, and I don't recommend giving in to someone who trying to hold your account for ransom.
