Its turning into a grind game that you dont even know if the grind is worth it because.... you might get 400 blue essence.... or you might get 1000.... I am playing the same champs over and over and over and over... you are going to make people board of your game.\r\n\r\nRIOT... you caint be thit money hungry can you??????\r\n\r\nif there is a link i can post this or something like this to enter a complaint, please let me know.","replies":[]}
