I have been stuck in bronze ever since i started playing. Very late Season 2. I was a Complete noob. Not very much experience with moba's. So i thought id have some fun and try out ranked play, Not knowing that it was going to ruin my ranking for my account for THE REST OF MY LIFE. I know everyone's solution to this is to make a new account, and start over to secure a better ranked score. This to me is just a Cheat. \n\nI have some pride when I put my Username in. So I have been unwilling to start a new account under some false identity... So now since i have this stupid pride.....Every new season a fresh start....except, that since i was bronze when I dicked around as a total noob. I have been stuck in bronze with other bronze league trolls, feeders,Jerk-offs. I'm stuck with the other kids who are attempting ranked for the first time, or dumb enough to use a champ in ranked for the very first time, hoping they will destroy the other team on pure luck....I know the common response will be that I'm just bronze league, don't have the skill or whatever you want to call it to move to silver, gold..or higher.\n\n I have a vast knowledge of the champions of league. I own almost 100 purely earning them from my play. I know every skill of every champion i play against. But I'm stuck with the noobs in bronze. I have gone through seasons of kids who still think its a good idea to take Kat for first pick.....when we all know that leaves the enemy team to choose 5 champs with stuns, pop-ups, and cc of all kind to make sure that kat will do NOTHING to them.... \n\nIf league were to do a true restart on the ranked play...make the provisional 20 matches idc....I'm sick of playing these games just to have this 15 year old kids join my ranked match when they only have 20 minutes before bed time...and force another loss on my already frustrating record. I know there are thousands of other players that feel the same as me. Its just sad to see that Riot turns a deaf ear to bronze league players...I know the pro's are your go too guys and all....but does that mean riot thinks I'm not worthwhile in the League Family? Have i not bought enough skins to help support the game I love? Are my 7 rune pages meaningless unless I win a championship? \n\nPlease Riot, I'm stuck in Elo Hell and no matter how hard I try or how good i get....I cant play for the other 4 guys on my team every game....the ranking system might be fine for a brand new player....or a player who did great the previous season. But for players like myself, who shouldn't be stuck in bronze. It is a Joke. Thanks for letting me vent some frustration out on this forum. I know that it wont really be seen by any Riot people, and wont be taken seriously by anyone else. But Ive been loyal to the League ever since i first played a match years ago.....and have not been rewarded. (oh except you did give me a free trynd skin for being a \"nice\" summoner) ( which i didn't really earn because i didn't have internet for about 8 months,so while i was gone you just thought i was being nice lol)","replies":[{"poster":"SmashKingDex","date":"2015-01-28T04:25:46.389+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"well...\n4 solutions\n1.

Play each match like its you in a 1v1 for the 1st 15min & shut  that other person down. then it's a 1v5 & if your lucky your Team \"helps\". The BEST lane to Hyper carry your way out Bronze, Silver, & Gold is MIDDLE LANE as an assassin. \n{{champion:84}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:11}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:238}} {{champion:91}} \nif you get these champs \"rolling\" there is basically ZERO way to stop them. even if you are split pushing on  {{champion:157}} {{champion:238}} {{champion:91}}  & you ignore your team for the most part or you are Team fighting out of your mind with {{champion:1}} {{champion:55}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:24}} {{champion:222}} {{champion:58}} {{champion:29}} {{champion:157}}  & making sure you secure x3 kills, then simply by lack of bodies on the enemy Team your Team cant really mess that up. 2v5 or 2v4 PUSH. Kills are great & all but Objectives win games, simply put. HYPER CARRIES!\n\n2. DuoQ really Helps! with some sort of chat system with a VERY smart & strategy versed friend(not just a random)\n\n3. reduce the amount of Ranked games you actually play. I LITERALLY play 2 Ranked matches a day. Unless I go 2-0(in that case I will ONLY play 1 more). or if I get my Promo's I will continue to play Ranked matches. but 1v1'g & Normals is where it's @ tbh. you gotta MASTER rotations & champs. Play Jungle A LOT, even if its not your \"main\". mainly because if you have a good idea of jungle paths & strength of the average jglr it helps you play in your lane ALOT better & SAFER. if you are top, middle, or ADC buy the Yellow Trinket & upgrade it the moment you hit lvl9(remember \"SoloQ\", you can't count on your \"team\" to win the game. It's YOU).\n\n4. Join a Ranked Team or start a Ranked Team 3v3 or 5v5. of players who have the same drive & knowledge of the game as yourself(like myself) & stop playing SoloQ. climb as a Team, because after all that is where this game SHINES 5v5 Ranked Teams. that is League, NOT SoloQ.\n\njust remember I believe the only part of the Ranked League system that doesn't actually work is the fact that 90% of the time Hyper Carries or Carries will be the only SummonerProfiles that actually get out of LowEloHell. \ntbh I feel that like in TeamBuilder the game should keep track of that ACTUAL champs you are selecting & give LeaguePoints based off of what you are actually doing in your matches......Not just KDA & Wins. Like Tanks are the best example. scroll through the Ranks Profiles I BET you see MAYBE 20 Tanks on all lists(& most of those are a player who played the tank champ a few times & has 7,000,000 matches with Vayne & Akali lolz\n\n{{champion:1}} {{champion:201}} {{champion:36}} {{champion:40}} {{champion:150}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:38}} {{champion:20}} {{champion:27}} {{champion:412}} {{champion:154}} {{champion:23}}  Much Love.\n\n\nbut to wrap it all up I suggest you play these FIVE champs & master them & I promise you that you will climb the ranks\n1.{{champion:238}}  for Middle Lane\n2.{{champion:92}}  for Top Lane\n3.{{champion:67}}  for ADC\n4.{{champion:64}}  for Jungle\n5.{{champion:40}}  for Support\n\nI hope I helped open your eyes a bit, Good Luck Brother.\n{{champion:27}} {{champion:20}} {{champion:1}} {{champion:86}}","replies":[{"poster":"TheButcherToasty","date":"2015-01-28T21:56:33.501+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So my last promo...and trist leaves at lvl 3.
