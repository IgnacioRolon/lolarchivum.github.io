I joined League when the 1st teaser came up and this moment stuck in my mind. There was some kind of magic, some mystic about new champion. All community was thinking about why Vi, Sona, Garen, Zed were killed. That was sooo exciting. But i died when i saw trailer for the 1st time: the music, the cinematic.... I don&#039;t know how to explain that.. There was something, a moment when i said: omg im in love with this champion. But enough about teasers. Time passed and then RedMercy ( A YouTuber ) uploaded video with gameplay. 1st at all i fell in love with his voice. Quinton Flynn did his job just amazing, i believe every phrase, sorry i dont know english that well but all i wanna say that Jhin&#039;s voice and image... its just an art. The mechanic is just amazing. I love it so much. I know the meaning of &quot; 4 &quot; and i love this. That gives to Jhin his &quot; deep &quot; idk how to say that... The killing part of his skill set is ult: When you see a low hp enemy and u press &quot; r &quot; time just stops. This is only about you and enemy, it&#039;s enemy&#039;s curtain call. Music starts and exactly this moment is so important. There are no words in the whole world to describe what i feel. Also i like his gun &quot; Whisper &quot;. The name is amazing. The idea of transforming gun in to Sniper rifle... oooh... i LOVE it! Jhin is champion about minutiae. For example: when you buy &quot; Phantom dancer &quot; Jhin says: start the music, i&#039;ll make them dance. God damm its just unbelievable!!!! Skins for Jhin are amazing 2, i like &quot; Hight noon &quot; and &quot; Blood moon &quot; skins but SKT skin is strange, there is no that &quot; deep &quot;. So if you can, please Riot, bring life to SKT Jhin skin. I don&#039;t have any skins for Jhin but i&#039;m in deeeeeeep love with his original look. Why i wrote it just now? I just listed to his login screen music ( its just amazing music, the best!!! )  and felt that love to Jhin and i just want to say: Dear Riot, i love you all, thanks for Jhin, thanks for your love to him, thank you for amazing lore for him, just THANKS &lt;3 \nBTW i just got lvl 7 on him and im soooo happy xD\n--- To Riot Games from true fan, thanks! :){{champion:202}}","replies":[{"poster":"Ed the Conqueror","date":"2017-06-28T20:00:05.436+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for listening to Jhin's music :D had a great time writing his login screen piece and the music for \"The Virtuoso\"!\n\n<3\n\nEd the Conqueror","replies":[{"poster":"SpayronFIN","date":"2017-06-28T20:38:16.886+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"TY, i wish you all the best and inspiration for your new amazing music!!!! <3","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"AD Yuumi","date":"2017-06-28T21:43:44.756+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you were a TRUE Jhin fan you'd have stopped playing him after rank 4 :3\n\n;)\n\nGlad you like him so much. I'm happy the final result lived up to your expectations from the promo :D  The art teams surrounding him did some amazing things. Meant I had to work extra hard to make sure the design was on par with the rest of the character.  I remember one time during dev BravoRay (his concept artist) came up to me and complained that the ult wasn't cool enough.  He was expecting this awesome sniper moment where everything got blown away and at the time the spell didn't even hit minions!  Good thing he brought it up :D\n\n-Jhinxylord","replies":[{"poster":"SpayronFIN","date":"2017-06-29T08:44:49.914+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello, thanks for your feedback!
