Cool, I think that&#039;s a great change that will make her more interactive in lane. However, I don&#039;t see how that&#039;s supposed to encourage Morgana to go mid lane at all. \n\nWouldn&#039;t a Morgana who goes mid be more likely to use her W on waves to clear, thus getting less benefit from this change than a support Morgana who uses her W mostly on champions? \n\nCan someone explain if I&#039;m wrong on this?","replies":[{"poster":"Bronze 5 Teeto","date":"2017-12-06T11:18:55.249+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":0,"body":"Morgana scales better with this passive.

She will be able to harass more often and heal more from it, and the early buffs to her mana regen means she won't rum OOM quite as often if she plays aggressively.
