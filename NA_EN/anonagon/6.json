That, of course, meant less League, but that was fine. League is a shite game anyway. This thread is going to be a list of all the games I beat this year (I will update if I beat any more this month). I&#039;m also going to give every game positive (+), negative (-), or neutal (0) rating to show whether or not I&#039;d recommend you also play that game. If you want to know more about a game or my opinion on it, feel free to ask.\n\nAll the Steam games I beat in 2016:\n\nAdventure Time: Secret of the Nameless Kingdom (0)\nAnodyne (+)\nBorderlands 2 (+, but only if you have friends to play with)\nChroma Squad (+)\nDarkMaus (+)\nDarksiders (+)\nDeadcore (0)\nDeadfall Adventures (-)\nDust: An Elysian Tail (+)\nFEZ (+)\nHammerwatch (0)\nHatoful Boyfriend (+)\nJotun (+)\nLast Knight: Rogue Rider Edition (-)\nLove (+)\nMark of the Ninja (0)\nMassive Chalice (+)\nMomodora 3 (+)\nMomodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight (+)\nNoitu Love 2: Devolution (+)\nOceanhorn: Monster of Uncharted Seas (+)\nOdallus: The Dark Call (+)\nOut There Somewhere (0)\nPolarity (-)\nPortal (+)\nPortal 2 (+)\nThe Room (+)\nShantae and the Pirate&#039;s Curse (+)\nShantae: Risky&#039;s Revenge (-)\nThe Stanley Parable (+)\nTitan Souls (+)\nValkyria Chronicles (+)\nVVVVVV (+) \nXeodrifter (+) \nZiggurat (+)\n\nyes, I gave most of these a positive rating, but its easy to sort out the really bad games before you even buy.\n\nOf these games, the ones I would super recommend as absolute must plays are:\n\nHatoful Boyfriend\nMomodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight\nOdallus: The Dark Call (this one might be a bit aggressive - I just finished it so its fresh in my mind)\nPortal/Portal 2\nValkyria Chronicles\nVVVVVV\n\nEDIT: Beat two more: Hammerwatch (0) and Jotun (+)\nWhat games did you beat in 2016?","replies":[]}
