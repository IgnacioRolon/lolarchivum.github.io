This isn't an fps issue - there is no noticable difference in fps during this time. It sounds like a thing that should happen if I'm having connection issues, but I'm on a stable internet connection and am having no issues with any other online games.\r\n\r\nI also have other graphical issues. They don't seem related to my main problem on the surface, but they started happening at the same time. The two I've noticed so far are that I don't see the spawn animations for any jungle camps, and that whenever Ekko uses his Q, its not in the right place. Instead of being where it should be, it hovers about twice the cast range away.\r\n\r\nAny idea whats causing this stuff?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-08T05:37:25.929+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What it sounds like you're experiencing is *Packet Loss* or *Extreme Packet Buffering*, which occurs if there are issues along your route to the server.
