{"poster":"Anonagon","date":"2015-04-01T00:17:27.573+0000","title":"How to buff Zed, the most underpowered and hard to play champion in the game","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":100,"down_votes":45,"body":"As we all know, Zed is a champion that not only is incredibly hard to play, but isn&#039;t properly rewarded for the skill he takes to play. This is incredibly disappointing as Zed is hands-down the best designed champion in the game. But perhaps he is *too* healthy, and this abundance of counterplay makes him ridiculously weak.\n\nWhat buffs does Zed the Shadow Lad need then? \n\n**Increased Attack Speed**\n\nI know, I know. This would be a revert, and Riot historically avoids reverting nerfs unless it comes to very cool but underpowered champions, like Ryze. But Zed is just like Ryze! A cool fun champion with a history of great plays in the LCS. Zed&#039;s attack speed nerf was a true gutting and needs a total revert.\n\n**Higher Bonus AD From W**\n\nWith the new tank meta,  tanks have more health than ever, but Zed isn&#039;t getting more AD to keep up. As an assassin known for his ability to shred tanks, Zed should not have to deal with this. Increased bonus AD from W would go a long way to bringing Zed back to the ridiculous tank shredder we know and love.\n\n**An Overall Better Ultimate**\n\nZed takes so much skill to use, so it comes as such a disappointment that Riot lets this theoretically fantastic ability be countered by a single item purchase. While I do not expect Riot to nerf both Zhonya&#039;s Hourglass and Quicksilver Sash just for Zed, I do not think it would be too much to have Death Mark be a special exception to these item&#039;s actives. Another thing about Zed&#039;s ultimate - it puts him at so much risk! Theres an entire split second at the end of the travel time where you just can&#039;t press R fast enough, eating a CC or some nukes. Its very annoying that so often after ulting Zed will have to spend some time lifestealing his health back to full, because a second opponent can do quite a lot of damage in Death Mark&#039;s duration while you kill your target. Therefore I suggest that Zed be untargetable for the entire duration of his ultimate.\n\nEDIT: 7/14/15\n\nIt appears that Riot is so hateful of our sneaky friend Zed that they disabled him from the game! I understand that many bad players have trouble playing against him, but that is no reason to make up some fake bug as an excuse to disable him! This champion was already unplayable before being made literally unplayable - is this Riot's way of saying they are leaving our favorite ninja in the dust?","replies":[{"poster":"Fauxfire","date":"2015-04-01T00:18:09.559+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":33,"body":"What is this even satirizing?","replies":[{"poster":"Anonagon","date":"2015-04-01T00:22:52.707+0000","up_votes":99,"down_votes":9,"body":"Why do you suggest that my entirely serious proposal is an attempt at satire?","replies":[{"poster":"Hawkefire","date":"2015-04-01T06:27:17.378+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":0,"body":"God the amount of sarcasm dripping from this post is wonderful.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Fadedpf","date":"2015-04-01T00:22:22.677+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":41,"body":"Unlimited harass in lane, super safe lane, no mana cost, destroy adcs and squishies with a {{item:3134}} .
