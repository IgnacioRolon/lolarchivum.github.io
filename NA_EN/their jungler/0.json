It is rare to see a jungler, even at level 30 people still go duo top. People never leash when people do decide to play jungle. Nasus support, anyone? Shyvana mid? Those are all normal picks in LAN. There is no clear distinction between an ADC and a supp. People just treat it as duo bot and split the farm. Good luck ending the game 5v5 because most have awful internet or just leave if you ks them (even on accident or in a scenario where they would not have gotten the kill anyways)","replies":[]}
