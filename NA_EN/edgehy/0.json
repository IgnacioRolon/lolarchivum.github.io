The amount of gold Gangplank can stack up with this and the mastery bandit (which everyone runs on him) is absurd. In fact, every nerf so far to him has been justified given his power in competitive play. But these powder keg changes... This is a gutting. If you go through with these changes, you are practically deleting him from the game.\r\n\r\nThe thing you have to understand is gangplank often uses triple barrel combos to get off a reliable chain in teamfights, this change allows him to do this once every 14 seconds or so late game with max CDR since the current supply cap is 3 and it would take about 13 seconds to generate two barrels (22 for 3). Given the length of teamfights and the storage supply cap, this is basically an ultimate cooldown overall, which is completely absurd. Even if gangplank went with a 2 barrel combo instead of a 3 barrel combo, he&#039;d still be unable to reliably chain and would have long down times in between combos.\r\n\r\nYou know what this change does? It basically turns him back into old gangplank with a fancy aoe combo he can use once in a teamfight. Yes his ult is more powerful but still, only being able to do this basically once in a fight is making him a walking cleanse with a targeted AA that gives him a Trinity proc aka old gangplank. And we know how bad that was.\r\n\r\nI realize powder keg is an absurd powerful spell and currently it&#039;s arguable that it is completely broken. But the design is good and I feel this change is basically you conceding that you don&#039;t like this design. Instead of completely butchering it, why not change the way they work with armor? Or why not remove its power to crit and give it an AD ratio? There are several changes that you could make that are better than this. Even changing his max supply to 4 instead of 5 could be a reasonable change. But don&#039;t do this, the gangplank rework was a success and it&#039;s arguable he&#039;s just in need of a few changes, maybe even numbers alone. But butchering him this way is the wrong answer.

This really hurts as a Gangplank main. The things that made him good just vanishing. He has a lot of counterplay and a Kassadin like early, just basicly weak and needs to farm and snowball super hard, otherwise he is \"completely\" useless. Gangplank has used his W, CC him again he is dead. Gangplank has no escapes and can't avoid knockups? Dead. His barrels are super fragile and can be destroyed and what happens if he has no barrels anymore? In teamfights - dead.\n\nThis is so sad. Champions like LeBlanc, Rengar and Veigar still have their oneshots with no real counterplay to them (i know these champions are really hard to balance). And Gangplanks Barrels have really high counterplay actually.\nIn late GP's Barrels have a 12 second cooldown now and your main combo is a 2/3 barrel chain. Without cooldown reduction you have to wait 38 seconds to get a combo in now. That is nearly a ultimate cooldown. This is just what kinda guts him, you take away his benefits - his high damage zoning potential if played well (here again - GP has a very high skillcap, not everyone is able to play him). He still has his damage... but is just able to use it every 38 seconds. Nerf his barrel damage or just the armor penetration itself. But please don't remove what makes him strong if played well.\n\nEdit: But i still can say that i will still main him even if he now got these nerfs (nothing can part me with my Pirate <3).\nIt's still is kinda sad though.","replies":[{"poster":"Sahn Uzal","date":"2016-02-12T20:48:38.344+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Exactly how I feel, I'd rather play a low damage version of GP than a version of GP with barrel chains on a cooldown longer than Talons ultimate\n{{summoner:31}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"The Yetii Rider","date":"2016-02-12T02:23:28.076+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"If you remove the way he ignores armor, he becomes just as screwed by current armor pen items as Riven and Renekton, except that unlike them he can't quickly build stacks of Black Cleaver.\n\nIf GP is going to be an AD burst champion without range or attack speed, he needs armor pen.

This nerf accomplishes two things, first it encourages the GP player to think ahead, set up a starter barrel or two at neutral objectives 30 seconds before the fight starts, or in the bushes in the jungle next to a tower someone is rotating towards, this makes it possible to make those 3 barrels go a lot farther, and I think when they were making GP they invisioned a champ where you were thinking ahead and laying retreat paths of barrels to outplay people with, instead of just machinegunning out barrels, which nailing double and triple cahins at max speed is very skillful and apm / mouse accuracy intensive, is not all GP should be about.\n\nWhich leads me into my next point, he can still drop out a triple or double combo on command right from the start, and if he was not able to set things up, yes, that will be all he has for barrels in that fight, make them count. GP is supposed to be unforgiving high skill cap champ, I know that I have ended a number of team fights by nailing a barrel combo into a squishy or two. Ive also lost some fights have the barrels miss. Now when barrels miss, and you werent prepared ahead of time with started barrels, it will be VERY punishing, and it should be, GP is meant to be a hard champion. Currently he is certainly tough mechanically to play to his fullest, however from a macro sense (thinking ahead, where should u be / position) he isnt too challenging, just show up and throw ur ammo at them. GP will need to be meticulous and calculating to succeed, and as a GP main im excited about that. \n\nMostly split pushing with a side of grouping when a big neutral objective comes up looks like what gp should be doing with these changes. Araming up and down mid lane will not be a good way to go when u only have 1 shot at doing damage per minute. \n\nI think this change WILL 'separate the good gps from the great gps', and Im looking forward to making it work","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheOvermind","date":"2016-02-12T11:02:10.069+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"This is against what they said in a recent patch, they said that their approach with gangplank was a slow and methodical one, nailing one  thing at a time.
