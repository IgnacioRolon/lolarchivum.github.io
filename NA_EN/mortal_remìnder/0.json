I've used the \"Hextech Repair Tool\" as well as full client repairs and still no results. \r\nWhen I type in my password incorrectly it instantly tells me its incorrect. But when I try to legitimately login, it gets stuck at authenticating for several minutes then says it failed to connect. \r\nI've checked my firewall settings to make sure that League is enabled and it is. I've exhausted all of my options.

Speed tests are like normal. \n\nMy SOLE issue, is the ability to play League without a VPN. Seeing how this has been pinpointed to the Midwest and potentially Comcast in specific, are you able to provide us with an update that someone from RIOT has reached out to Comcast in this area for this issue?\n\nOr is the problem not as widespread / reported as these boards make it seem?\n\nBest Wishes, thanks for your help.\n\nedit:  i wanted to add that i totally understand your job is probably just a community manager and you are only able to relay what information you are given. i appreciate the help buddy.
