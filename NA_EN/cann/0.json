Then the enemy team ban sett, i thought to myself \"thank god\", the this dude is super pissed and told me he was going to feed now, So we get in game and the guy and his duo keep saying they were going to feed, so they died 2 mins, then told my lane in /all that they were coming to help, The dude runs in under tower and just dies, did that 2 more times. I just keep my cool and keep playing, I started winning my lane even thought the enemy had 3 kills, So i killed my lane and the adc says in all chat \"you need more help, i will come mid some more\" and you proceeded to give my lane 2 more kills. Some how we still won that game, i reported the adc for inting and just looked at there match history and this player is still playing. Why does riot allow these people to keep playing. This is why we have so many people who rage and get chat ban. I wanted to yell at this person so bad, but if i did, i would have been punished. Not the person who tried to ruin everyone game. Riot needs to get there shit together.","replies":[{"poster":"CharDeeMcDenniz","date":"2020-01-24T02:44:19.314+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"the instant gratification you're looking for will never happen, best to change your expectations\n\nthe game has 10's of millions of players, all submitting thousands upon thousands of \"int'ing\" reports every single day\n\nexpecting someone to be punished the minute after you push report is just unrealistic","replies":[{"poster":"Cann","date":"2020-01-24T02:46:34.091+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":9,"body":"lol ok, how long do you think it should take?","replies":[{"poster":"CharDeeMcDenniz","date":"2020-01-24T02:53:31.286+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"or you could just, ya know, move on with life?\n\ndon't you think you've given an internet troll enough of your time and energy?

Not only does Riot have to actually sift through the BS reports, which I'd say 95%+ of them are, but it's also not just one game that gets taken into account for inting. There has to be a history of it. One game of someone going 0-20 is highly unlikely to cause them to get banned unless there are other circumstances involved.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JustA kleo","date":"2020-01-24T12:49:22.209+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"based on the comments here im surprised mods didnt close this thread up yet","replies":[]},{"poster":"NF Remilia","date":"2020-01-24T06:42:13.264+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> i made the commit that he was going to feed\n\nEven if he wasnt going to feed , that right there tilted him so he fed. >.> what did you expect to get from your toxicity?","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2020-01-24T03:16:22.314+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"As long as people like you have nothing better to do than be mad, trolls gonna troll.","replies":[{"poster":"Cann","date":"2020-01-24T03:35:04.187+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2020-01-24T03:41:39.708+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Lol, what?\n\nI wait until angry kids like you burn out before i play ranked each season.
