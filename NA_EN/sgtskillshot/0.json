Many of the posts have issues following the jump from a Comcast server in Santa Clara CA, but there was a lack of a consistent IP address for that   location, leading me to believe that the Santa Clara hop is not the issue, but likely the hop before the main issue for the server connectivity. \r\n\r\n2.  The hop following the Santa Clara hop was the one with the most consistency. The hop after the Santa Clara hop usually went to a server in Sunny Vale CA, and more specifically [68.86.90.93]. This server was in 100% of the tracerts that had a hop in Sunny Vale that I examined including my own. That IP may be a good place to start looking if you are looking or a place to start. \r\n\r\n3. The last consistent issue was a hop to a server in Great Oaks CA, IP [68.86.87.158]. This IP was in all but 1 of the tracerts I saw, following the hops in Santa Clara and Sunny Vale. as well as in tracerts that did not even have the Sunny Vale [68.86.90.93] hop in them. This address would also be a possible cause of the problem.\r\n\r\nI hope that this information was helpful, If you are reading this as a Community member please get it attention so \"Wuks\" and the others at Riot can see.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance\r\n\r\n-SGTSkillShot","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-06-10T21:17:53.615+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Really appreciate you putting this post together!\n\nThis is something we have been looking into as well and everything seems to point to some type of ISP related issues in both Southern and Northern California.
