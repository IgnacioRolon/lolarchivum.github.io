Not sure if the season has ended or not, because I just picked the game back up after about 2-3 months of not playing. A couple days ago, I could queue for ranked, however, when I was queueing for Draft(I'm still scrubby, so I'm doing draft to learn the game more) and noticed Ranked and Flex queue was grayed out. Could I get some clarification, please? Lol. Thanks in advance.","replies":[{"poster":"Rabbitonlibra","date":"2018-01-26T21:49:19.903+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Now my screen doesn't even show the rank option riot fix it pls","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-04T00:25:44.172+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you were trying to play while there was maintenance going on.
