Maybe Strategist or whatever. \r\n\r\n1. In an already highly toxic community, you've got people who see \"support\" and read \"lap dog.\" It's usually these players that lead to the most losses. \r\n2. It deters people from playing the role. I don't mind that, I get insta-games in TB, but it's not good for the game overall. If \"Support\" was a champ, it would be due for a rework\r\n3. The other issue I keep seeing is that supports are pigeon-holed in the mind of the player base. A classic example is Gangplank. His secondary role is \"support\" - the game lists him as that. He also has a pretty decent kit for supporting, and when I queue up in TB as a support GB I kicked religiously. \r\n\r\nI want to repeat myself here to make a point. **When I take a game-listed support champ, with a solid support kit, in a position that's in demand, and will cut down on their queue time by 5 to 10 minutes - they still choose to wait. ** That might involve other elements, but the primary one is this \"Gangplank can't CC things for me to get fed. Not a support. Kick him.\"\r\n\r\nAnd you can safely guess that this is a person who doesn't play support often. Personally, I don't care. I'm getting another game in 5 seconds. Hell, kick me from the next 10 games, I'm still getting to play well before your 4 are. (or 40, as it were). But this isn't about me.

His passive was also reused on Lissandra of all things.\n\n{{champion:16}} is the saddest to see nerfed because of her immensely useful kit.

But at least she has 2 damaging spells.\n\n{{champion:44}} is possibly coming in close 3rd or 4th on the support scale.

She functions as a beefy frontline in fights, yet goes around warding and protecting the ADC during laning. In contrast, Sona would be a Support role played in the Support position. She's definitely not a beefy frontline; instead she buffs the team while disrupting the enemy. However, she also goes around warding and protecting the ADC during laning.\n\nRiot could probably help resolve some of the confusion by simply renaming the Support role to differentiate from the Support position.

Denying enemy attacks (Black shield, wind wall, body blocking, etc.)\n\nI personally would not count CC.  CC is a different thing than support IMO and generally serves very different purposes than any of the things I listed above.  My list is all about helping teammates survive, get stronger, and be able to win fights by relying on their own strengths and abilities.  CC is more like you caught an enemy and then they're just a free kill for someone on your team.  A carry could kill them without even needing any of their abilities.  If I could make up my own list of all the types of champions, it's be something more like:\n\nBruiser Tank - Guys like darius and garen that are tanks but also designed to do some pretty good damage even in short amounts of time.\nCC Tank - Champions like Sion or Leona that are tanks but still help win fights by keeping enemies CC'd a lot, not necessarily by doing much damage.\nBurst Mage - Mage like leblanc or katarina that does a lot of damage over a short period of time, although not necessarily very high dps over a long period of time.\nDPS Mage - Mage like Ziggs, Vel'Koz, Xerath, or Karthus that, given enough time, can do a whole lot of damage to enemies.\nAssassin - Physical damage dealer version of a burst mage.  Someone like Talon or Zed.\nADC / Marksman - Ranged physical version of a DPS Mage that tries to maximize damage per second using physical attacks.\nADC / Melee - Melee physical version of a marksman.  For guys like Master Yi that, although he could be considered an assassin, I say he should be something different.  Because his dps does not end after defeating one enemy.  He can wipe out their entire team faster than a marksman if given the chance.  I don't know exactly what this class should be called but I feel like it should exist.\nFighter - Somewhere between a bruiser and an assassin.  Not a tank, but not someone that can insta kill enemies, either.   But still generally very good at fighting 1v1 and good offense and good defense.  Someone like Jax.\nTraditional Support - Does any decent amount of the 11 things mentioned above.  Soraka, Sona, etc.\nCC Support - Well, the only thing that's left.  A champion that isn't a CC tank but still relies a lot on CC.  Basically any of the supports that have CC abilities that they plan to use on enemies reasonably often.  Most of what they do lies in their other abilities.  But some other supports, like Nami, Janna can potentially have their opponents CC'd quite a lot of the time.\n\nSome champions are more than one type obviously, but I think I could fit every champion in the game into these, with giving most of them a secondary.
