They don't have the gold, those items cost a boatload, and Sunfire/Thornmail/Deadman's don't do a lot to help your ADC in the laning phase. Conversely, Mage Support have an easier climb up to AP damage while having earlier items that support the ally in lane, and upgrde until useful items at mid/late game. \r\n\r\nThis is also troubling because both Top and Jungle seem allergic to tanks. Everyone wants a fighter. Which means if you give half a shit about team comp the support is forced to either take a tank or roll the dice. Something I personally and not the most thrilled with. \r\n\r\nSTs are also at something of a disadvantage because of runes. As a support mage, I can off-set Domination and take Ghost Ward which substantially upgrades my ward time, and vision on the map. To do this as a tank, I need to forego my Magical Footware, which only exacerbates the problem of money _again_. This made me realize that we're overvaluing tank items for what amounts to \"not much.\" Maybe I'm alone in that but the tank items don't give me a ton of survival skill with the way ADCs are currently. \r\n\r\ntl;dr - tank supports pay a lot of items that don't work well, and don't help lane opponents. Please add new items or change the costs of existing items.","replies":[{"poster":"heroikc","date":"2018-01-31T18:41:09.718+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I partically don't like how there are limited hp items for support tanks, particularly early on (save for the relic shield line).

They become able to deal damage but not able to outdamage any dedicated damage dealers.\n\nIf tanks have those options of items to pick then it would give tanks of both kind(Top, Bot, Vanguard, Warden) more choice in getting the right item and become more viable.

Having said that, I don't think of tank supports as particularly OP in the scheme of things.

If you're hanging on the ability to protect the ADC, take an enchanter. The purpose of a support tank is (for the most part) disrupting the enemy via CC while being a pain in the ass to kill. Your CC is pretty much only reliant on level, and the aforementioned Sunfire/THornmail/Deadmans DO make you very hard to kill.\n\nIt sounds more like you're upset about the limited budget that support tanks have to work with, which is really a discussion about itemization costs.","replies":[{"poster":"AirSonance","date":"2018-02-01T07:16:04.730+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"he did mention how Sunfire, Thornmail, and Deadmans don't have synergy with a carry. The most you'd get is the slow from Deadman's passive and that's about it. Meanwhile the enchanters get Ardent Censer which allows them to buff their carries and boosts shields and heals. Taric is probably the only tank support who can take that item, and even then he's only delaying any more beefy stats he could have had from other items\n\nmy two bits, anyways.

Being able to buff the ADC is nice and all, but should NOT be the job of a tank support. It's enchanter's niche; buff and heal allies. If you give tank supports the ability to provide buffs to ADCs while still being able to do normal tank duties, you've just completely marginalized enchanters.\n\nPersonally I don't think tank supports NEED to have a direct interaction with the carry. I'm already diving into the enemy team to grab one of them and hold him down for my ADC/midlaner to use as a punching bag. I shouldn't also have to move his fists for him.\n\nBesides, lack of specific synergy is one of the ways to open up bot for non-Marksmen.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Kaioko","date":"2018-01-31T20:33:42.608+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel like current tank supports are already so innately tanky as it is though not sure why their items would need buffs.

However, itemization wise your options for utility tank are Righteous Glory, Knights Vow, and Locket. Righteous Glory is to expensive to finish and only good when you are either ahead or playing Cho'gath. Knights Vow was gutted down to a measly 250hp because non-supports used to buy it. Locket, while still good eventually, is SIGNIFICANTLY worse without a ruby sighstone and it's hp shield is weak af without around 1k bonus hp. So your left with the only option of buying the more expensive tanky options intended for top laners and junglers which is also a problem because tanks have the worst gold income item.  Even if all these items were buffed to be better thats still only 3 items which means ZERO build variety.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Floupi","date":"2018-02-01T11:14:19.861+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"RookPusher","date":"2018-02-01T15:26:06.026+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Fluffy Pikachu,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=L1AOKBKG,comment-id=0007,timestamp=2018-02-01T11:14:19.861+0000)\n>\n> Sunfire/Thornmail/Deadman are NOT for supports of course that you feel useless if you build that kind of shit.

Those items do a lot for the team, but not as much for me. I don't want Sunfire and Thornmail because I want kills. I want them because I need to have some determent from them just going HAM on me. Maybe the support tank needs an item that essentially does what Tahm's Thick Skin does. \n\nAll too often if it's an ADC and I in a 3v2 I can't help them as much as I'd like.
