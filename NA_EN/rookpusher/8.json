But nope..... everyone is apparently freaken clueless. And that is why I hate ranked. I know I suck but fuck I miss playing with people who at least were thinking on the same level as me.

(And usually I prefer TT, ARAM, or the RGMQ) Their shouldn't be a ton of edge cases going beyond that however, and preventing these edge cases is why Riot has introduced more tools to help end game. (Notably the Baron buff) It's also the reason why Tower damage/defense doesn't scale nearly as well as champion damage/defense. Because they are suppose to be notably weaker as the game goes on. \n\nThe thing I've noticed with longer games, is that the gold difference becomes meaningless, and the team who fell behind will eventually catch up, bringing things back to a stale mate. As a result, If you can't finish the game before you've reached your 6th item, it's going to become harder to do so, and an already long game becomes longer. This is also why Riot replaced the Dragon bounty with a stacking Dragon buff.

Now don't get me wrong, you'll have games that are unwinnable and you just get screwed no matter what because you were literally just dealt the worst hand possible, however the chances are extremely unlikely.

Generally not a good thing to do if you're looking to improve your own gameplay. Most of the time even if what an ally is doing is bad an enemy will do equally something bad that can be punished.

It literally sounds like you're arguing against your point. \"my team and still losing because they chased bait for the 11th time.\" The way you say this makes it sound like 1 mistake isn't costly at all.\n\nYou saying towers needing a buff isn't being based on by any measure except your rank and team mates. It's still an opinion, for the record a popular opinion on the boards, but it's still an opinion, but my problem is you didn't provide any reasoning behind this other than you getting aced at 40 minutes and losing.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Supreme Senpai69","date":"2017-05-24T10:31:18.544+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"till losing because they chased bait for the 11th time despite my trying to explain why it's bad, and then having the enemy team - heretofore on the ropes - waltzing into our base and winning.\"\n\nYou might have deserved the win but your team didn't if they did this 11 times.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tobias Brackner","date":"2017-05-24T18:45:05.721+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"One mistake only costs you the game if the death timers are 45 seconds.\n\nOtherwise what you are witnessing is the person consistently outplaying you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sun Wu Ryuumoku","date":"2017-05-24T15:27:08.423+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":">You should buff the holy hell out of towers immediately.\n\nthis wouldn't change ur issue.\n\n>One mistake is too costly\n\nhmmm\n\n>still losing because they chased bait for the 11th time\n\n11th =/= ONE mistake. \n\n>Winning lane doesn't matter because if at the 40 min \n\nseems as u are lucky most of game are already decided at 10min what left is just struggle at most till 30.
