To that end, the supports that take towers quickest seem to hold the biggest advantage. ADCs are going to be better than most other classes. And since there are two of you, bot should determine the lane. \r\n\r\nSo which supports are going to be most effective at advancing the lane? \r\n\r\nSorry if this sounds like alchemy. I&#039;ve been reviewing my games played and I can&#039;t find a solution to getting out of Bronze.","replies":[{"poster":"Peritheus","date":"2017-09-02T08:54:22.258+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Should be {{champion:17}}  and {{champion:498}}, they just chunk the towers with in the 5-6 min for 1st turret if left alone with turret.","replies":[]},{"poster":"scribblerHD","date":"2017-09-01T21:22:59.612+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was bronze V and now I'm silver 3 ( not so good ), it was really easy to climb out of bronze playing support all you need to do is play karma/Leona/ something which has a point click cc and just roam mid all the time and tilt the enemy mid laner, then when it comes to the 15 minute mark you say in all chat \" why does your jungler never gank\" which makes them tilt harder, and you want to sympathise properly with the enemies so they rage their jungles every move so he goes afk or starts to feed, now the game is 6v4 easy win\n\nso basicly you win the game with 0 effort","replies":[]},{"poster":"LordGeovanni","date":"2017-09-01T21:18:19.358+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i try to but when ever you split for a tower your team decides to back off and let the enemy 5 man gank you without trying to pressure at all.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Quepha","date":"2017-09-01T19:54:42.433+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lux support.

You have to trust your own play, but if you get the practice in you will ruin games. Bronze and Silver (even my Plat friend) just don't respond to splitpushes well. They will chase and lose mid or they will ignore and lose inhib. \n\n{{champion:83}} \nIs ok. Even when I beat him in lane in bronze, he would still get first inhib if I stop pushing top. \n{{champion:74}} \nShould be easy enough for a few bronze games.","replies":[{"poster":"RookPusher","date":"2017-09-01T19:14:09.009+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been using Jax in the jungle and I like the results of that.
