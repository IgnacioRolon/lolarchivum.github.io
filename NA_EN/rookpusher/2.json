The Bloodmoon Thresh skin was known about since the second Clinton Administration, and it still isn't available for purchase? Do we need to unlock some achievement to be able to purchase this skin?\r\n\r\nI'm just wondering since we only have two other options: Deep Terror which looks like someone just said \"slap some coral on him\"; or Championship which is blue. Full stop. \r\n\r\nYou finally announce a skin with some element of nuance and you leave it in limbo for eternity. I suppose that's appropriate for Thresh, but I'm playing him, not being killed by him. Only you, Riot, are currently killing me. \r\n\r\n{{champion:412}}","replies":[]}
