But I'd argue that Taric isn't a classic tank, and I'd also argue that his ult is the epitome of avoiding damage in the first place.\n\nThe thing about him is that he doesn't really fill the role of a frontline tank. His actual tanking tools are nowhere near as strong as Naut, Leo, Alistar, etc., and he has no cc chain. What he does have is a pretty unique mix of engage, disengage, sustain, dive, and anti-dive. \n\nI've just started spamming him, and my results are pretty good so far. I've won 11 out of 20 games so far, but two of those games I started {{item:3302}} and one of them I ended up top lane due to a troll/griefer on my team. Honestly, {{item:3302}} is just trash right now.\n\nSo I take 12 armor, 12 MR, and 175-ish flat hp in runes. Rush {{item:3069}} and run Windspeaker's. So far I've won 11 games of the 17 where I've used that setup, and it's not a coincidence.  You get the hp and mana regen from the coin line, plus the early armor and MS from raptor, plus the higher income compared to the relic line, plus you start the game with 10% CDR. And you don't have to build swifties or a mana or regen item with Talisman. \n\nThe main thing is that it's absurdly hard to push you out of lane after just a {{item:3096}} because you're healing 60 hp off every minion wave with enough mana to actually heal when you have 2 or 3 stacks on Q.","replies":[{"poster":"Maximum Morde","date":"2016-12-20T16:47:14.119+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah he's not bad.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Vekkna","date":"2016-12-20T15:15:11.575+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My {{champion:44}} post below got downvoted, but go look at the new data from champ.gg. Leona down, Taric way way up. \n\nLeona's problem right now is that sustain and peel supports are so strong. The stronger Janna and Soraka are, the harder time Leona has. \n\nHonestly, I think Leona is still very good, but another part of her losing the sustain war is the relic shield line being pretty weak. I think {{item:3069}} would actually be stronger with way better hp regen, higher gold income, and stronger engage/dive potential. You would just have to stack some flat hp in runes to make up the hp gap early.","replies":[]},{"poster":"NekoniClaws","date":"2016-12-20T15:07:36.688+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So, pros and cons - it becomes pretty self explanatory why she's not popular >\n\nCONS: \nShe does not fit kite comps, and only rarely fits pick comps.\nShe has to all-in or go home\nShe relies on teamwork and skilled play to follow up her engages\nShe is not self-sufficient and can't carry\nShe can't do anything if her ADC is, or _has to play_ passive\nShe is a pure support, and her job is to feed her team the kills.

The counter for Leona is a team comp she does not fit.\n\nLeona acts as a sort of... avalanche trigger, in playstyle, she can snowball multiple players in the right circumstances. Unfortunately those circumstances are rare. 'Pick' comps and passive adcs are really common.
