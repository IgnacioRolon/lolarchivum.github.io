Yes watching zoe instadelete someone is fun, watching yasuo turn around a 1v1 is fun... playing against any of that? Not so much.\n\nHow does this apply to game length? People don't like watching long laning phases and long teamfight phases because they don't feel the tension of it all as much as the players. People would rather watch their favorite team roflstomp their opponents in 20 minutes.\n\nPlayers on the other hand, clearly like the chance to scale and the time to come back from any early game mistakes they/their team may have made. Laning against someone that has 2 kills up on you now means they can dive 1 shot you and take 1 turret shot if you're lucky. Can you imagine how fun it would be if you could actually comeback from that via outplays most of the time? If killing someone 2 kills down on you wasn't completely effortless as it is now and took similar effort as the first 2 times, then both of the players would get a chance to play the game instead of either getting one-shot or one-shotting. \n\nThen the lategame has a chance of being more even because everyone had time to show their skill - if one team is truly better than the other, they will still be really far ahead, but this won't be off of just 1 or 2 mistakes by the enemy, but by a full length laning phase.\n\nso 35-40 is a really good number for games that last long enough but not too long.
