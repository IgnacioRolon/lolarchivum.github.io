But even I&#039;m sick of all the 8-year-old fantasy champs getting this many skins. \r\n\r\nAt a certain point it stops being funny and starts getting obnoxious. I&#039;m not here advocating for Champ X to get a new skin because it&#039;s been Y Years, but I&#039;m starting to feel like it&#039;s really negligent on Riot&#039;s part to keep this gross trend up. I&#039;ve been here for the year you cranked out a new champ every 2 weeks, which I have to imagine takes a lot more time and effort than reskinning them. \r\n\r\nWhen are you going to give serious consideration to a lot of these champs that needs some love, Riot? I mean, during the Bilgewater event, you released event-skins, and then Event-themed skins for champs who weren&#039;t involved - great option. Why can&#039;t we do this again?","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-06-14T21:24:23.993+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Did you not read the article about this topic that came out like 2 days ago?","replies":[{"poster":"RookPusher","date":"2017-06-15T03:07:01.702+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, sorry.
