I keep receiving key fragments (for good sportsmanship it says) and then I don't actually get them. I've gotten 4 now where it pops up and says keep it up and then I don't see it in my loot. Any thoughts?{{sticker:sg-jinx}}","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-23T20:21:09.457+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Was this all today?

It could be old notifications, not sure though. I'm not gonna whine about it though, I have plenty of in game skins already so hope this helps others that might have this issue. Thanks!","replies":[]}]}]}
