So i decided to see how fast i can get banned by being &#039;toxic&#039;. \r\n\r\n*On all my accounts i behaved the same way*\r\n\r\nMy first account took about 1.5  years to get perma banned.\r\nMy second took just a little over 5 months.\r\nMy third took 3 months\r\nMy 4th took 1 month.... wait what???\r\n\r\nMy point being the system has become way to strict at least in my opinion.\r\nIt is retarded how u can be banned so quick especially when for the majority of people its easy to rage because the amount of trolls there are.\r\nAlso what have i noticed now u can be banned pretty much for calling someone a noob and telling them that they are  feeding. Even for complaining for jungle ganks.  The insults don&#039;t even have to be strong anymore. \r\n\r\nWhat i have also noticed is the system or players (maybe both) isn&#039;t judging properly. When u get banned u always get a summary why u got banned right. Okay so now we move into the retarded part. On several occasions the summary gives me games where i was not being toxic, or should i say not to toxic ish. \r\n\r\n14 day ban*\r\n \r\nFor example in my last summary it was because of 3 games. One of them was because i told the ezreal to stfu and get carried since he was doing bad. Keep in mind I was 10/2 he was 0/4 . He and my 2 other teammates were raging my ally zyra for trolling, even though she was also 9/2 and doing well . The others all had very negative scores. This went on all game so i am wondering how how did i get punished for saying this one sentence and he and the other allies did not get punished at all. ( i did report him later)\r\n\r\nThe second summary was because i was also abusive..... So i had died top and went to mid since i could fight the mid laner. I said lets lane switch to my ally since she was losing lane as well (down 40 cs and 2 deaths). Okay so ill admit she didn&#039;t wanna do that but i could wreck the mid laner so was like better 1 lane wins then 2 lanes lose. That was my bad but... after that even though she saw me win mid lane she just ran her mouth about me feeding top( i had one death) and she kept complaining then fed him too. I told her to stfu and play cause i was doing good and so was the bot lane so we could win. She didn&#039;t she kept talking and fell super behind. (50 cs at 20 min). Then i told her look stop talking shit cause ur way behind and i&#039;m way stronger so ur not helping. She kept raging and after i reported her nothing... but i did get punished..\r\n\r\nThis was my bad here for forcing her out of lane but it was for the best.\r\n\r\nThe third game was a game with no ganks. Now i had been ganked over 9 times by the 15 min mark and my jungler had done anything. I kept asking all game till i snapped at him and said. Can u fking gank already I am waiting here  for ganks. U still have not ganked me for all this time.  Your just farming and doing nothing. Please gank I need one. Then he says fk you im not suppose to win ur lane. So then im like its your job to help a little atleast if im struggling. He says stfu. So i say alright be like that stupid\r\n\r\nNow i know its my fault for saying stupid but come on u wanna ban me for that? \r\n\r\nPersonally I never directly hated on anyone and never insulted anyone. Worst I said is stfu which ill admit is rude. \r\nOn the other hand i dont understand how i got punished and not them. I personally don&#039;t see the logic. Their behaviour was way worst then mine yet the system or players idk who judges this didn&#039;t think so. \r\nI am also sure many other players have experienced these *FAIR* bans. \r\n\r\nLet me know ur opinion on the bans and if it was a fair ban. And if u think the system is broken right now","replies":[{"poster":"Periscope","date":"2018-10-20T07:32:01.535+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Locking this post, due to its severely old age.\n\nIf you have any questions about this moderation, feel free to reach out to us in the [Boards Discord](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/community-moderation/7rtKBZLi-boards-moderation-discord-verification) or [Discuss the Boards](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/community-moderation).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Riot Tantram","date":"2016-12-09T20:54:31.370+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"> So i decided to see how fast i can get banned by being 'toxic'.\n\n> My point being the system has become way to strict at least in my opinion.\n\nSo, when you're TRYING to get banned, you get banned.

I personally don't see the logic. Their behaviour was way worst then mine yet the system or players idk who judges this didn't think so\n\nOkay, so I just want to pick this out and explain a little bit about how the system works, particularly as to why you were punished but not the other players.\n\nTo start, Riot understands that we are human and that we are likely to have bad or off games, so they designed the Instant Feedback System to take that into account. This means that if you are normally a neutral or positive player but you happen to have the one game where you are toxic, you are more than likely not going to be punished for it, so long as you don't continue being toxic and you go back to your normal behavior afterwards. You get punished when that occasional bad game is happening a lot more frequently than a large majority of other players. You see, reports alone only flag your account for review, but a review will only happen once you have reached a certain threshold of reported games.\n\nSo, for your specific case, \"why you were punished but not them,\" this is very likely because they don't exhibit that kind of behavior very often, whereas you do. Think of it like this. In your one game with these players, both of you exhibit toxic behavior. However, you're on game 10 of being toxic whereas they're only on game 1 (numbers are purely hypothetical). After the game, you both get reported, but only you punished because you have a bigger history of behaving like this while the other player doesn't.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2016-12-09T16:14:40.933+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, I'd like to pose you the question: how long do you think a player should be allowed to be toxic before receiving a permanent suspension?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2016-12-09T16:51:31.125+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you are running a toxic experiment, time really isn't a proper factor to use.\n\nYou should use # of games played as a proper measure. \n\nWhen someone hits their punishment threshold, the system will punish them. It may not be too obvious right now, so Riot will be implementing new behavioral features after the new client is up and running smoothly.\n\nWhether it is fair, will probably depend on your chat logs.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hazdog","date":"2016-12-09T16:04:27.884+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If the system is strict, that's good.
