My teams were 6 Yordles + Brand + Lissandra and it's next to impossible to win when facing Assassins, Demons or Rangers. I invested in Kennen Poppy and Gnar but it's not working well against magic and physical attackers. They seem so meh and I end up in 8th and 6th place. I placed my units mostly all in the last row except Poppy and Gnar one row above to be front line. I wish there was a history match option so I can see where did I go wrong, but I'm pretty sure I did my best with itemization, still it's impossible to beat those guys with lvl 3s units. \r\n\r\nAre they just not favorable or am I missing something? What would you do differently if you were in my shoes?","replies":[{"poster":"Jesi Oni","date":"2019-09-08T16:32:51.365+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was once destroyed by sorcerer yordles. You have lulu and veigar already. Add Morgana and as many other fancy mages as you can and blow enemies up.

It's better to add 1 sorcerer to yordles than 2 elementals, since you really need more damage not more tankiness (yordles already beat physical damage comps, and magic damage comps are weak to getting blown up faster than they blow you up)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porglit","date":"2019-09-07T14:53:28.367+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Their main issue is against magic.  Yordles can do very well against the rest, but they have no defense for sorcs.
