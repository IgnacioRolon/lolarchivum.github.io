This will allow you to make the pings louder in game, without having having to lower every other slider and then raise pings.  If you go to the patch notes and scroll down to \"In-Game Audio Settings\", that should sum up the changes.  Here is the link to patch notes:\n\nhttp://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-52-notes\n\nI hope this helps!","replies":[{"poster":"Captain Volibear","date":"2015-02-03T18:07:48.621+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is there a way to mute a single player's pings?
