After like 2 weeks I can finally kill beginner bots more time than they kill me, so was considering to join PVP.  However last night I lost a custom bot game which I could win when I was extremely bad and get killed like 1/7/2. T I&#039;m really confused why I would lose a bot game when I tried so hard to kill the robots, and if I&#039;m still too bad to join PVP.\r\n\r\nI was playing Morgana mid and trying to push the lane, cleared all the turrets on my lane and my team robots came to push further. However unfortunately I died in a team fight. Then I went to the shop to buy sth. Then I saw that all team robots died. After 50 seconds of death timer, the enemies were already was our base, and inhibitor was destroyed. I am not good at team fight, especially when my team robots are not picking up low health enemies when my R failed to kill them. So...we lost. \r\n\r\nAny know possible reason why we got pushed so fast? How to avoid this?? I know I&#039;m a noob but I don&#039;t want to be a noob to bots. \r\n\r\nBTW: my team: Morgana, Zigg, Zilean, Galio\r\nOther team: Sivir, Zyra, Galio, MasterYi, Ezreal\r\nWe were all level 18 at the end of the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Valderis Vandala","date":"2015-07-31T02:08:59.625+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The most important thing to remember is to just not die, learn to avoid getting into fights you can't win, learn to stay out of situation you can't escape from.\n\nSome roles are easier to play against bots then others, also keep the enemy team in mind when building your items.\n\nPlaying a tank and building lots of health/resist/armor is a very easy way to win your lane, dominate team fights, and protect your base against the bots. Sejuani is fun and easy to play as a tank.\n\nOr you can try a ADC and build a ton of damage/attack speed/critical and completely destroy everything that dares to come close. Tristana is a lot of fun to play and very easy to win with against bots, its also easy to escape bad situation due to her jump and ult.\n\n(I've had a game where I played a Tristana and build the following items: Phantom Dancer, Infinity Edge, Runaan's Hurricane and Blood Thirster . I could just camp at their nexus even with all towers still up and just farm penta's. I ended up with 49 kills that game, it was just silly. It won't always work, sometimes bots just get scared and all 5 will just refuse to leave the shop area just because you are standing there all alone. XD)\n\nThis is all stuff that works against bots, don't do these things against human players.\n\nEDIT:\nYou can also fuck around with the team compositions. Giving the enemy bots only champions that deal magic damage and then building a lot of resist items makes for a very easy game. The opposite also works give the enemy only champions that primarily deal normal damage and building armor items.\n\nOr give them only champions of one type, like an all ADC composition, they will have a hard time getting enough gold to be meaningful in fights and will be easy to kill all game.\n\nYou can also give them champions with little or no CC making for far easier team fights later on.\n\nYou can also make things harder on yourself as well by giving your team a terrible composition and the enemy team a good one. The more weird stuff you try out the better a grasp of the game you'll get.\n\nPS: Staying alive is important due to how bots reacts when they face a towers. Bots are very hesitant to walk in range of towers when a enemy champion is nearby, so if you can keep yourself from dieing then no mater how low your HP or your tower HP gets the dumb AI will most likely still back off even though you have no realistic way of defending it. This is also way it is important to focus on minions when defending, bots do not approach towers without minions. Having the Teleport summoner skill is also very useful so you can come to the aid of any tower at any time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"npbeisbol","date":"2015-07-28T18:31:29.384+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry if someone already said this, i didnt read through it all...but I would suggest finding someone to play with who already has experience with the game.

But if you take out say two turrets from one lane, they will send at least THREE bots to that lane to defend it. However; they don't just back down once it is defended, they STAY.\n\nSo now you have 3+ bots in one lane constantly auto-attacking minions...it will push pretty damn fast.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2015-07-26T19:13:50.833+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1.  Focus objectives, inhibs > towers > dragons\n2.  Get CS.  CS is your main paycheck in the game.\n3.  Bots can't always group up well or focus objectives, you are going to have to either force the lane after mid game or hold off the other team while your bots decide if they want to push another lane.\n4.  Bots are cowards, victory goes to the bold.  So in short you can't trust them\n5.  Intermediate bots are better than beginning bots.  If you are still learning and can't win, give yourself an advantage.\n6.  You need more practice.  MOBAs aren't things you can learn in a day.  Gotta learn the champs, what to get on them, and what to do in a game.\n7.  I'm guessing you are still using a lot of free champs.  Try doing some Co-op vs AI games in order to get your first win of the day.  With the IP you get from there, you can start buying champs that work for you.\n8.

I think custom bot games are fine to help out with some basics, but once you get those down, you need to get into real games sooner or later.

Unfortunately, you can't count on bot teammates for ANYTHING.  Try playing Co-op vs AI with other players on your team.  You will hit a hard cap on what you can learn in custom bots really fast.  HELL, even Co-op vs AI is only really good for learning the basics of the game, figuring out new champions and avoiding smurfs.\n\nThat said, when you DO pvp prepare to lose a LOT at first.  Not only is it a huge jump in things to worry about compared to bots but pv is full of smurfs who are playing on their lowered leveled accounts just to unfairly stomp new players.  Just try to roll with the punches and you'll get the hang of it.

If your lane opponent is still there, you really can't do much about it. If you're alone in lane and you know they're taking a Drag, clear the wave as fast as possible and get there to help contest it. Sometimes, however, there really isn't much you can do.

Since it's Morgana, were you landing her Q reliably?\n\nBasic level, those are the big ones. Morgana has an easy time last hitting minions with rank 2 W, so if you have the mana to spare then you can use that. Don't push the lane too far at first, as the towers can shred you if you're not careful. And keep an eye on your allies in lane, early game random chance/unfavorable matchups can lead to an ally bot getting behind.

Start with just you in a custom game.  You want to eventually get the a point where you can get about 30 or so at the 5 minute mark or 90+ after ten minutes.  You can either do CS practice until the 5 minute mark or the 10 minute mark.  However this is going to take a ton of time and practice.  \n\nOnce you are happy with your CS, add a single intermediate bot and go into bot lane.

Even better, watch a couple youtube videos of people playing that champion; they might show you some combos or strategies that you want to try out.\n\nFinally, try not to die. If you get low, go back to base and heal. Buy a {{item:2041}} so you constantly have healing potions that get refilled when you go back.
