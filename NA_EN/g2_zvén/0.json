Still, I'm sorry to hear about the situation you're going through, and the ticketing system is the best way to get this resolved.  Now that you have your account, you can reply back and dispute the ban with the player behavior team.  If you do, I still want you to consider the negative experiences this ended up causing for other players.  Get back to the specialist in your ticket or create a new one if it's closed, and please don't share your account again.","replies":[{"poster":"G2 Zvén","date":"2017-06-02T18:02:40.181+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I understand buddy, but heres the thing, my team worked 4 weeks into my case and got my account back for me, and as soon as I logged onto it, it was banned for another 7 days after he had gotten it banned 7 days ago, for a 14 day ban, I didn't trust him with it, he changed the details of the account as soon as he got it, that's the thing.
