Also if yasuo want's to use it to protect someone and he is not in front of them already he would need to Flash or be lucky to have a enemy minion wave there to reach that player faster, meanwhile Braum can just hit W (which also gives him and the ally more Armor/MR) with his wall primed.","replies":[{"poster":"Cavesloth","date":"2018-04-04T19:42:03.119+0000","up_votes":28,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah, but Braum's isn't omni directional.
