So if you know what causes some of these problems and have a fix for them please let me know. Thank you\r\n\r\n-I have no audio. The audio stopped working a while back both in client and in game audio. I still get audio everywhere else on my laptop just any audio related to the League of Legends client doesn't work. If I plug into a separate monitor or screen I get audio from that source. And I checked the audio settings they are not turned off.\r\n\r\n-Occasionally at the end of a game I get the \"Your session has expired\" message and the client closes. It doesn't happen after every game but it does happen enough to be really annoying.\r\n\r\n-Sometimes but not very often when starting up the loading screen(after champ select) it doesn't load and freezes. I can't get task manager to open. The quickest fix I've found for this is to log off of my user on my laptop, which closes all open programs, and re log back in. After that it normally loads the game. But if the game loaded quickly for everyone else I might end up joining the game a little late. \r\n\r\n-This only happen once or twice but I thought I would post it to maybe help shed some knowledge as to what could be wrong. Upon entering champ select I was not able to change my summoner spells. When I clicked on my summoner spells nothing would happen. Normally a list of spells would pop up but it wouldn't pop up for me.\r\n\r\nAgain for the most part these are minor things not affecting my game play too much. And some these problems could just be from having a poor performing computer or internet. There are probably other minor errors or problems I keep encountering but either I couldn't remember them while writing this or they don't happen enough or are big enough to mention here. But the first two happen frequently and I would like a fix for them if possible but it's not the end of the world if I don't get a fix them.\r\n\r\nIf it helps I think this is close to if not the exact laptop I am using.\r\nAcer Aspire 5\r\nAMD Ryzen 3 3200U processor Dual-core 2.60 GHz\r\nAMD Radeonâ„¢ Vega 3","replies":[]}
