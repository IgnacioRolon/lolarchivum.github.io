Points should be rewarded largely on how well you play a champion and not how well your entire team plays as a team. Right now points are rewarded largely on whether you win or lose so you can go 2/30/3 and if your team wins you get like 5x the amount of champion points you would get then if you go 30/2/25 and lose. You should be rewarded largely on how well you play that champion and not how well your team plays as a whole. You&#039;re not earning team points you&#039;re earning points for how well you play a specific champion. I understand that the outcome of the game is important but it should not influence your reward points that much in this area.","replies":[]}
