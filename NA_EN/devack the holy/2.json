Including Runes and Masteries.\r\n\r\nI&#039;ve been playing Lux a lot lately, and while my build and play with her is decent, I feel it could be better. So I&#039;ve come to the boards, asking for help with improving my build for my favorite lady of light.\r\n\r\nMy Match history using Lux:\r\n\r\nhttp://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-history/NA/36027185?champion=99","replies":[{"poster":"AirSonance","date":"2015-06-25T21:24:59.433+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lux is fairly offensive, dealing a lot of damage with quick bursts and low cooldowns. I usually build for at least a bit of mana regen right off (she's a bit of a mana sink), and then start building for as much AP as possible. She's also at range most of the time, so defense shouldn't be a priority most of the time. If you need defense, take items with additional AP.\n\nSo, start off buying {{item:3114}} or {{item:3028}} (take chalice for a bit of defense in lane), {{item:3020}} {{item:3285}} next, and finish the {{item:3165}} or {{item:3174}} now. After that, buy what you need (AP, CDR, defense, penetration, etc ) \n\nThat's usually how I build. Might not work for everyone, but this works for me and my play.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vekkna","date":"2015-06-25T21:13:14.419+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've found that a {{item:3070}}  as first buy is a massive QoL improvement. 1/10 junglers gives up their blue buff before 20 minutes (in my experience), so you can never count on that.
