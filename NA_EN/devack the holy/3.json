He had dc'd for the first five minutes.\r\n\r\nI was left in bot lane, with the occasional gank from Jarvan who was raging at the missing ADC. Despite this, I managed to secure First Blood on their Quinn, and was feeling pretty comfortable. Once Twitch made it back into the game, he had admitted that his computer had crashed on him during loading, and was pretty apologetic. I wasn't mad and didn't rage, since I had made their bot lane's lives pretty miserable by this point. I simply told him to farm to catch up, and let me worry about the enemy. Sure enough, as soon as they spotted the level 1 Twitch, they tried to focus him, only to meet one VERY p*ssed-off Mama Leona. I score a kill on Sona with Twitch getting a kill on Quinn about a minute later. By this point, even Jarvan was hopeful about this game, and I turned into a juggernaut with my first death coming around the 13 minute mark. By the end, we had turned a 4v5 into a 5v5 pubstomp, and Twitch was very appreciative of his support. \r\n\r\nTo think that this was in Bronze 5... Now, if only more games as support in this tier went as good, I might enjoy ranked more.\r\n\r\nThe lesson here is: Don't rage at the guy who DC'd at the start, unless they did it to be a d*ck. There's still hope.\r\n\r\nAs long as they reconnect early enough for it not to really matter.\r\n\r\nMatch details: http://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/1743437444/36027185?tab=overview","replies":[{"poster":"Drunk Rummate","date":"2015-04-08T15:19:09.503+0000","up_votes":37,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Devack The Holy,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=NNcnXQoW,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-04-08T15:08:18.657+0000)\n>\n> The lesson here is: Bronze 5 supports should DDoS their AD carries to increase their chances of winning lane.\n\nFixed that for you ;)\n\nAnd if you can't tell, I'm kidding.
