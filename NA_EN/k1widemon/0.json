When i relaunch LoL it makes me repair my client and then it works. Due to the repair taking so long, it usually results in afk timers and i have gone through 2 sets of 20 min already. Now as i am trying to update my client i keep getting \"an unexpected error\" and i cannot find any way to resolve the issue.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-26T21:31:08.886+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Coupled with the corrupt files, bugsplats, and patching issues, I believe this may be caused by missing administrative permissions that the Client really needs. Because the client interacts with a lot of files outside the League folder, these privileges are necessary in order to run correctly. \n\nI recommend working through the steps in our [permissions guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) as a next step in resolving this. Let me know the results.","replies":[]}]}
