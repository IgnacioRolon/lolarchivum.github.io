Yesterday i left a game and got a 20 min queue ban for it. The problem is, evertime im trying to queue up the timer suddenly stops after 10-15 mins and i have to restart. I already tried to reinstall and repair the client. Nothing works tho. Any suggestions?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-20T21:50:33.761+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know it sounds weird, but if your network has some kind of hiccup while in the queue it *might* make the matchmaking servers think you exited the queue and have the timer restart. Double check your [**network settings**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) really quick to make sure that's all in order.\n\nAfter that, if the queue keeps resetting could you shoot me a quick screenshot showing the queue timer as well as the timer that shows how long you've been in the queue?","replies":[]}]}
