He was obscenely broken.  If the solution to dealing with him is to learn how to play against him, then fine.  But while I have him pegged (usually), most of the players at my Elo can&#039;t help but feed him.  I know you&#039;re concerned about the state of professional play, but lower-level play is suffering because of this guy.\r\n\r\nSo what do you do?  You concede his brokenness (kind of) and then give him a slap on the wrist?  You didn&#039;t even touch one of base damages or AP ratios.  And if you&#039;re worried about his early game, then leave all that the same and just nerf his mid and high ability levels.  AND GIVE HIS ULTIMATE A MANA COST.  HE HAS A FREE HEAL THAT REWARDS HIM FOR GOING WAY IN OVER HIS HEAD.  The amount of freedom he has to dive and tear up back lines with relatively little risk is just insane.","replies":[{"poster":"Davy Crockett","date":"2015-06-16T03:29:19.591+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":3,"body":"Chill bro with the rant.

Like honestly I think Ekko has a lot of potential to be a very well balanced champ, but right now he's all over the place with the way his kit works.  It's just kind of stupid.  I'm not saying they need to nerf him into the ground either, but besides the regular amount of time it takes for people to adjust to new champions, I think he could use some refocusing in his kit, and some of that could definitely include a bigger nerf than a slight mana cost increase and more visibility on something that wasn't that hard to begin with.\n\nLike seriously, I think they shouldn't have nerfed the visibility on his w and ult because now you'd have to be really stupid to get caught in them.  That's not even playable, and it's not what will make him a healthy champ.  I think they should change the w and ult to back where they were and instead cut some of his damage (and maybe retweak how one of his passives works).  I would rehash the mana cost on the ult, but we already discussed that.","replies":[{"poster":"AutoreactiveCD4","date":"2015-06-16T14:00:47.022+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I agree he needs tweaks but is balancable.

So if she isn't exempt from that kind of treatment, then why should Ekko be?  If it's just that they need more time to observe him, I'm fine with that, but I felt this should be said.

He is manageable if you know how to deal with him.  For your elo I feel it will just take awhile longer to learn how to deal with him.  Every elo has its problem champions, so nerfing ones because they are problems in specific areas isn't a good decision for balancing.

His damage falls off in the late game, and the only reason he's a threat in the mid game is that stacking Lich Bane and Luden's enhances his burst beyond its normally mediocre levels (and he's NOT the only champ who does this).

He gets his third passive proc. This is huge. Enormous movespeed swing and a spell's worth of damage. But you DID just eat any combination of three spells and autoattacks. When you have two stacks, you are in SERIOUS danger. People respect Annie when she has her stun up, but they don't treat Ekko the same way yet. That's wrong, and that gets punished.\n\n2. You eat the shield stun. Also huge. HP shield with over a two second stun. That can be gg on a squishy easily. But his wind-up is a distinct \"baseball swing,\" a loud chime plays when he's setting up, and the area the shield stun hits is visible a moment before it lands. If Ekko can get to it, it is not okay to be there. Again, many people don't respect this. Don't stand in Dark Matter or Null Sphere, don't stand in that.\n\nI've played a considerable amount of Ekko and the majority of my kills are from people simply not respecting any part of the kit. The majority of my deaths are from R denial via CC, and burst damage.\n\nI feel like Ekko's strong because he's *complicated.* People didn't bother to learn what he does and how he does it, when they do know they don't respect it like they do for established champions (my favorite example is Annie).\n\nLike a lot of champions, there are criteria that must be met in most circumstances to engage Ekko successfully. If Brand lands his stun Q, you're in trouble. If Ahri lands Charm, you're in trouble. Understand Ekko's power spikes are his third passive stack and the shield stun and things will go a lot more smoothly.\n\nedit: Timewinder (Q) also hits *way* harder returning to Ekko than going out.","replies":[{"poster":"Viddax","date":"2015-06-24T22:04:22.882+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is exactly what I'm saying.
