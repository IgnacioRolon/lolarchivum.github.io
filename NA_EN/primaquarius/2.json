If Assasssins are allowed to get too out of control, Healers and even Mages of both lanes will quickly become irrelevant and be replaced with ranged champions building Bruiser instead of building around their kits.","replies":[{"poster":"Thebiggestpanda","date":"2016-10-22T23:03:10.156+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"From what I've seen of the reworks so far, Kha is by far the strongest and will likely be changed. Hopefully.... Everyone else has been changed to have more delayed and conditional damage. But honestly, support healers are supposed to be squishy. They are supposed to be a high priority target that will just sustain their team through a team fight single single handedly if they aren't focused.","replies":[]}]}
