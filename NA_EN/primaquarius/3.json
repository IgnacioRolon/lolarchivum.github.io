It's much better to combine them and get multiple buffs, and even then, it takes at least two. \n\nTo me, Water and Air are a great combination as they grant safety, and Fire and Earth combine well to take towers and future objectives. \n\nHowever, getting just a single buff of one type feels a bit lack luster. If you ever get three of the same one though: **_HOLY SHIT IS THE POWER REAL_**\n\nThree Water dragons is absurd when you decide you need to keep fighting, and the three Earth dragons will turn any team into a siege comp. Three Fire is a nearly free Rabadons passive, and three Air makes a mobilty boot enchantment, _on top of your actual boots_.\n\nSo to me, the dragons are nearly worthless on their own, and no matter what, you should always prefer that _you_ get the buffs instead of the enemy team.","replies":[{"poster":"Wimbledofy","date":"2016-05-28T21:28:05.092+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1 fire buff always feels nice, same with the water one before it was changed ( i haven't really gotten the new water one that much so idk how good it is)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Drunken Yasuo","date":"2016-05-28T18:47:42.146+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":9,"body":"shoudlnt talk about game balance while in bronze 5 0lp","replies":[{"poster":"Primaquarius","date":"2016-05-28T18:49:41.091+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Because rank = intelligence...pls","replies":[{"poster":"Drunken Yasuo","date":"2016-05-28T18:51:06.134+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":7,"body":"rank = game knowledge what youre missing, air dragon is shittier compared to the other dragons","replies":[{"poster":"redniwediS","date":"2016-05-28T18:53:37.143+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Now that's truly funny!
