She might be the single most aggressive champion in the game, and all the player needs is to know when to go hard and when not to. That's pretty much it, and it's not even a difficult judgement call to make.\n\nAre you and your carry at similar health to your lane opponents? Go hard in the motherfucking paint.\n\nAre you significantly weaker? Wait for a gank, **then** you go hard and you **die** for that double kill.\n\nDoes the enemy have an effective disengage? Harass; don't go hard.\n\nFor everything else it's zone and peel as appropriate.\n\nIf you're following these simple rules, and your lane isn't an oppressive hellhole for the enemies, it's probably because your carry is a quivering fuckboy who can't keep up with you.\n\nNo, but for real, Leona is easy.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Archon X","date":"2015-11-07T18:45:49.074+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"bruh you need sightstone","replies":[{"poster":"Primaquarius","date":"2015-11-07T18:57:01.668+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Upgraded ward trinket is enough after mid game for me actually","replies":[{"poster":"Archon X","date":"2015-11-07T19:02:07.965+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm a diamond 5 support main.\n\nYou need sightstone + sweeper upgraded into oracle.\n\nHere's a visual guide:\n\n{{item:2049}} + {{item:3341}} -> {{item:3364}}","replies":[{"poster":"Primaquarius","date":"2015-11-07T19:11:18.257+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If it works for you, by all means keep using it.

Its advantageous to have sightstone, but not always a must. One of huge advantages over upgraded trinket is that you can use sightstone to gain vision + sweeper to deny vision. Since his opponents arent really putting many wards, he doesnt really have to invest in sightstone","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Anomander","date":"2015-11-07T19:21:24.477+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bronze 5 strats are different then even silver let alone diamond.
