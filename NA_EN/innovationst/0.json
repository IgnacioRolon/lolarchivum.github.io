The biggest and most frustrating thing that I have seen is this: When Azir has multiple soldiers out and uses his Q ability, the first soldier summoned is the one that flies closest to the target point. Now, if all the soldiers are close to Azir, this doesn't present too much of a problem, but consider this scenario.\n\nAzir has summoned 2 other soldiers and has left them behind in a fight to chase after an opponent (but not far enough for them to dissipate). He summons a new soldier in hopes that he can Q to slow them. However, the closest soldier flies to the right of the target point instead! Several moments pass before the oldest soldier summoned (the one Azir left behind) catches up to the original target point, but by then the enemy champion has left that area. \n\nThe change I propose to help Azir players would be to have the closest soldier dash to the target point first. That way, it makes Q a much more reliable slow and chasing tool, rather than having an Azir run all the way out of range of his last soldiers in order to effectively use a Q. In essence, Azir is about having a lot of soldiers on the field at the same time by the end game, so forcing him to run away from them doesn't make too much sense.\n\nWhat do you think?","replies":[{"poster":"Drukyul","date":"2014-10-19T23:51:12.844+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"I didn't know this was the case, and definitely support the change.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BlazingSalvo","date":"2014-10-20T05:11:49.752+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just think Azir's Q is too slow for its range.

My soldiers seem to go where I want them to in general. *If* it is the case, I agree it should be changed. The soldiers do try to form a line when you move them(something I like personally), but the closest one to your cursor should go to the exact point of your cursor, and not beside it to accommodate a line formation.\n\n{{champion:268}} Still needs a ton of QoL changes. He's one of the funnest champs in the game to play, but he is challenging enough without the list of QoL issues.","replies":[]}]}
