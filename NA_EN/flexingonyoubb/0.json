Unless you&#039;re a pro player like tyler 1 when riot actually notices it.\r\n\r\nI played a game last night with a yasuo top on my team. He feed nasus 5 kills in 12 minutes. Then proceeds to run it down top over and over again.. dying like 15 times before the game was over.\r\n\r\nBut hell.. if you even so much as call someone a retard.. you&#039;ll get perma banned..\r\n\r\nI think riot is a bunch of fucking cry babies liberals who think their players need a safe space. Don&#039;t punish the ones intentionally ruining the game but punish those who talk trash. Makes sense..
