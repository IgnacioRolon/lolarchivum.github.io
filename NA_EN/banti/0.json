I picked the new masteries in the lobby and once again \"an unexpected error has occurred\" but it showed that the masteries were my new kindred masteries. I thought i was ok until i entered the game with my old masteries (for lissandra) on. I tried relogging, and the error persists. I tried repairing league, and the error persists. I havent tried it with my runes because they were ok and i didnt see a need to change them, but i assume the same problem would happen again. Am I the only one with this problem?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-08T20:20:55.548+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Issues saving masteries and other changes are usually due to either third party programs or a wonky config file.  As a first step, remove any apps you have running like play.tv and lolrecorder.  If this issue persists, then resetting your config may fix this up:\n\n **Log into the game** then hop into **a custom game**. *Alt+Tab* out of the match, then navigate to your League installation folder, which should be in C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\n\nDelete the folder named **Config**\n\nOnce you've deleted the folder, leave the custom match. You'll then want to hop into another custom match to confirm the changes were saved.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions!","replies":[{"poster":"Banti","date":"2016-10-08T20:54:24.171+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you so much ^_^ everything works, i just had to exit the game and relog in for the masteries to start saving.
