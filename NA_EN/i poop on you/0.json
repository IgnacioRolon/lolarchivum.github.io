I edited that one and went to create a new rune page, which would have been my 2nd custome rune page. It starts to create a rune page, but when I select the primary path it just takes me back to all of the rune pages. It wont allow me to create my 2nd free rune page.

If it's still not working, I can manually delete those pages so you can try with fresh empty rune pages. There's also a small chance this is some kind of connection related issue too, so we may need to adjust a couple settings.","replies":[{"poster":"I Poop on You","date":"2018-02-01T06:11:30.526+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its showing only 1 in my game...I did a game repair and closed and reopened my client several times and still only 1 rune page","replies":[{"poster":"I Poop on You","date":"2018-02-01T08:03:26.887+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh, and Im not sure why you see 2 rune pages....when Im in champ select I only have 1 rune page to pick from, not 2","replies":[{"poster":"I Poop on You","date":"2018-02-01T17:57:53.978+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Now I have 2 runes pages...thanks if you did anmything to help me","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-02-01T21:50:53.403+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Must have been something connection related, since I actually just now got back to work and saw these updates.
