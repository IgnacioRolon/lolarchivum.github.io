This has happened every time I&#039;ve played the skin since at least 8.5, possibly longer. The other forms still play as intended, and rotating in/out of Concussive does not resolve the issue.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2018-03-19T23:04:29.565+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Zansam. ^^ Judging by your icon, this mayyy be your favorite form? One of our sound designers is on the case and has a bug assigned to them. <3\n\n**EDIT**: Should be fixed with 8.7! :) ","replies":[]}]}
