Please check your network and attempt to reconnect to your game.\" My network connection is fine and I have tried turning off my Firewall along with my third party Firewall at the same time with the same results. I have even looked at topics on this and tried some of the solutions they had with no progress. I am a new player and I would really like to play this game but so far have not been able to. Help with this would be greatly appreciated.
