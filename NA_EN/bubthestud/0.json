Two things have to happen for me to do well in lane against a ranged champ.  First they have to have a enter a coma and second they still have to be blind and then maybe I can have fun top lane.

It's harshly imbalanced through the first 15 minutes of gameplay and VERY few junglers can do anything about it.

Darius and Mordekaiser are both pretty balanced after their most recent changes. In fact, I'm willing to bet a lot of people could argue Morde could use a late game buff. \n\nIt's not nearly as subjective as you're trying to make it. It's a matter of available counterplay and what that counterplay is. Against Vayne, most champs have to hide under their tower until mid game. It's no different than like Yi into Jax. Jax will punish him if he doesn't play safe. The issue is, Vayne and other ranged tops, do this to most of their matchups and basically just turn off that side of the map. \n\nIf you prefer fighting a Vayne then you've never faced an even remotely good one. Vayne has always been a bane of the community much like Akali. Again, her kit allows her to harshly bully melees. If you haven't done/experienced this, then idk why you're getting involved with this guy's post. It's not new and there are other champs that do it similarly.\n\nI'm Platinum hbu? Vayne has a 3 sec dash at level 1 when walking with the wave. And she'll just condemn one of you away. No single champ has the damage to burst her pre 6 so most junglers won't even gank her unless she pushes way up. Which, with proper wave management, can be avoided.\n\nAgain, not subjective, you just want it to be for some reason. Early cheezing someone, bullying them in lane, denying them cs, and repeat killing will lead to tilting and making someone play worse. It's part of the game whether you think it's an opinion or not. \n\nThe stats you clipped don't really prove much. You may have the playrates of the 2 champs he cites (and quinn), but there's another handful that have a similar abuse pattern and much higher play rates. And trust me, there is a constant fear of fighting a ranged champ. That's why most of the meta stays mobile like Riven and Jax. Every time a Darius player locks Darius 1st, he runs a huge risk of being useless all game into a list of ranged tops.\n\nYour right, Darius does get picked significantly more than those 3 combined. However, his winrate barely ever breaks 50% even though he's this extremely strong lane bullying resetting healing 1/2 his hp while on the brink of death champion (sarcasm). The fact is he's pretty balanced having little cc and an engage tool on a long cd. Not to mention he's really just too squishy to close out games solo. He's picked even more than Aatrox who in a lot of ways is a better version of Darius. Vayne's just all around better at playing top lane.","replies":[{"poster":"JackMcCarry","date":"2019-09-01T17:27:17.965+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Many is an exaggeration.

The same Morde who does not landslide win against any lane bullies top. Just because you get slapped by him doesn't make him opop.

And why would a jungler gank you and rely on you to do 100% of the damage? Do you play with a Nunu who misses his snowball every game? That basically means assassin jungles are useless.

Is that Gold and below or something? He doesn't even hit 51% in Korea while having a similar playrate. I never said Darius was a worse champ. He's largely better and more impactful thorughout the game, but that has nothing to do with the fact that a Vayne would completely shut him down in lane and make him useless. Vayne still beats more matchups and harder. The fact that she will rarely solo carry games translates to the statistical differences. This whole post was about Vayne being a borderline unbeatable oppressive cancerous thing to face top and that's still true. Even if you tihnk Darius is strong, he still has clear exploitable weaknesses throughout the game, unlike adcs top.\n\n> Literally everything you said here can be said for vayne too, only vayne has about 1/6th of his pickrate, and has 48% winrate, oh but she's ranged, so gutt her i guess.\n\nVayne is an adc that runs people down and smacks them with damage. She has constant ms buffs towards enemies and during her ult, near constant invis, she has plenty of engage for a marksman and more disengage than is typical. Darius is extremely different and plays an entirely different role. You say don't nerf her due to top, but it's more about giving melees a way to deal with the marksman abuse. It's a whole class problem and it branches to champs like Neeko and Viktor too.","replies":[{"poster":"JackMcCarry","date":"2019-09-02T18:09:24.351+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> You say don't nerf her due to top, but it's more about giving melees a way to deal with the marksman abuse.

Riven may be the exception as her 4 dashes are the single individual way to counter Vayne's 2 disengages. Think about picking Vayne into Garen, Darius, Pantheon, Renekton, Sion, Malphite, Poppy, etc. Her entire champion was designed to kite out fighters and tanks and she has full capability to do that at level 3, maybe it's even better that it's pre 6 because the fighters &amp; tanks often pick up a big mobility/burst ability at 6. Even at 6 and beyond, Vayne has a 3 sec cd q and she just repositions on them. Very few champions will one shot a farmed Vayne who is equal level with them. All she has to do is r>q and you'll miss a portion of your damage with most of these champs and she's all of a sudden not reachable in the fight any longer. \n\nAnd you're not comparing champs, you're comparing skill level. A silver player most likely has no idea how to kite and walk in between aas while a diamond riven is animation cancelling. You also chose THE single best top laner for most matchups in the game and that is straight statistical fact. She's also clearly the best option for engaging ranged besides Jax and aatrox.\n\nThis shit with adc tops is complete cheez, they're extremely low counterplay for what I would consider \"healthy\" gameplay. It ruins the entire game for multiple players, just like Viktor top did. Both top laners get to effectively do nothing, but farm back and forth to tower because Vayne has no engage and Vayne's opponent has no god forsaken chance of winning a trade or securing the kill into a push back, 3 seq short dashes, and near constant invisibility at 6. Especially when they mostly go ignite because everyone knows cheez players aren't good enough to win with tp. \n\nJust for picking Vayne the one player has almost complete lane control and map pressure due to constant lane priority. Very few jungs will have strong ganks into her and she has a lot of herald pressure even solo.\n\nThe fact is Vayne doesn't even need true damage to win all of these match ups bc she was just designed to destroy melees in a 1v1. Without having the chance to counterpick her with aatrox, this is a largely unbeatable lane and most junglers will not be able to continually gank for her since again, as she walks with the wave she has a guaranteed 3 sec q cd. The thing that really grosses me out is a melee has to play perfectly to not get annhilated by her, but Vayne just fishes for autos for 20 minutes and wins the game. Ridiculous that this has been allowed for so long.","replies":[]}]}]}
