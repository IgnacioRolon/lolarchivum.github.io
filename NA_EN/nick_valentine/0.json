I mean, yes, if it were an instant snare like {{champion:51}} trap combined with the silence after then it would be too flippin' brutal. However there is an element of counterplay or teamwork involved in it since the {{champion:16}} can predict where they're going to be, OR attempt to herd the enemy into a 1v whatever to avoid the snare. \n\nNow, moving on from just in supports in general, yeah. They usually aren't doing the damage, they're usually squishy, they're designed to protect an adc, so I don't see why they wouldn't be justified point and click cc.
