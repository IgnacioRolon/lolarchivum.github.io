I increased the mmr on the account, so although it was Gold 3 I was placed vs Plats. I just got to Promos and was 1 win 0 losses. I had 1 more game to go but the next game (i was playing top) our midlaner for no reason went afk at Level 2. But i kept playing, went 0/5/2 and lost the game. However, what I noticed was that I was promoted to Gold 2 for Losing a Game. I was wondering if riot Added this Feature recently to compensate afk's on promos or was it just my MMR and the way I played ?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-15T21:15:39.370+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Congrats!!!\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}} \n\nIt sounds like you had a Promo Helper active. If it's you lose your promos then make it back to them, you actually start with one free win! You won your first game, lost the second, but since you already had a free win counted that meant you had won your promos!\n\nI can't check for sure since this account is only level one, but if you give me your Summoner Name I can check up on that for ya ^_^!","replies":[]}]}
