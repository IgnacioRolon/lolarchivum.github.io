I just got to honor lvl 1 from honor lvl 4. Got chat restrictions and a message saying I forfeit my end of season rewards. Because of a situation where my team of trolls got me report by enemy team as well. Noe Riot set me a little chat box with the Chat logs of me only in it. In the format, they sent it to me. The chat can be read way differently than if it were put into context. They took my chat out of context to where it could actually look bad like I'm toxic now. I and my premade have been gaming together in the league for a year now. We sometimes call each other hoe or slut in game. which has never been an issue before. But in the chat when they take it out of context like this. They are banning me from calling my friend a hoe in a playful manner. something I have done for 3 years in the league and never had anything wrong with it. all of a sudden I encounter a troll of premades who convince enemy team im trolling and they ban, me for it? Has Riot lost their minds? and I can't even access my chat logs. I made a thread and everyone is asking me to post the chat logs to validate my case. But I have no possible way of doing so. So Riot you guys made me into a villain. and there is no jury. there is no true investigation. I just get Chat banned? from a troll skewing the story to the enemy team? and then you take my text out of context? likeee","replies":[{"poster":"Shuxer","date":"2017-09-21T22:55:10.709+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel you, I am in a same situation.
