Restarting the client seems to fix the issue but after playing a few games it sometimes comes back. Its not a major issue but it is a minor annoyance when it occurs, has anyone else experienced this and is Riot looking into fixes?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-16T23:19:34.185+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is this happening on the updated client?  If so, what happens if you try on the legacy:\n\n-  On the login screen of the open beta updated client, look for the \"Launch Legacy Client\" text at the bottom.\n-  Or create a shortcut directly to the legacy client in your League Installation. Just look for \"lol.launcher\"\n\nLet me know if going on the legacy resolves this!","replies":[{"poster":"videorfeak","date":"2016-12-17T01:01:28.644+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry for not specifying this, but this is actually happening on the legacy client.

Simply moving the mouse over the affected areas tends to fix it, almost like using an eraser on MS paint to erase useless lines. I will take a screenshot the next time it happens and load it here and submit a ticket for it. Its nothing major and doesn't occur too often, maybe once or twice a week of me playing religiously. Still though it is bad coding.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
