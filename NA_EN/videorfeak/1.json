It would be used so 2 people can play sharing the same computer using their own sets of mice and keyboards.","replies":[{"poster":"kattzkitti","date":"2017-10-22T06:52:52.268+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How would this be bannable?

It&#x27;s effectively the same as two people sitting next to each other on two separate computers.\n\nit can be bannable, since, in the past there have been people who have used a VM with botting programs which ic againest the TOS.\n\nthe problem with a VM is that riot cannot prove without being behind the players that there are two players playing at the same time or if its one player controlling a botted account to boost and sell which is also a bannable offence.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-22T21:16:35.381+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd steer clear of this for a couple reasons. First, I'm honestly not entirely sure if VM software would be detected as possibly malicious third-party software or not. This is actually most likely how people bot accounts if I had to guess.\n\nThe second and more important reason, playing two sets of League on the same PC might not work so well performance wise.","replies":[]}]}
