I tried using email but my email is not valid. My email is bad because when I was running my account for about two years ago, I made a valid email but it did, and I did not know it was so important. I spent a lot of money on account. I had a lot of skins and champions so I would be sorry because I like to play League of Legends every day. I remained logged into my account ( RitoGames111 ) on the League of Legends page. If someone knows how to help, I would appreciate it. Thanks to all who try to help! And sorry for my bad English.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-26T01:13:18.182+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If forgot my password isn't working because you can't access the email on file, you can still hit us up in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to get back in.
