I have a problem. One game a while back I was playing as soraka and had an unexpected issue with my connection, and I couldn't sufficiently play through the game. You can likely find that match in my match history, as I still haven't played enough games since then to get rid of it, even though it was quite a while ago.\n\nThe reason for this is this: Leaverbuster is a cruel and unusual punishment.\nI've been having several issues with this punishment which I think none of which were intended by RIOT when they set this punishment in place:\n\nIssue 1: First of all, this punishment lasts for 20 entire minutes of queue time, for something like 4 games... this means that by leaving a game or afking, we will be punished to wait for at LEAST something like an hour and 20 minutes. But wait- There's more.\n\nIssue 2: The punishment has several massive bugs, the first of which is the fact that, after a remake, the leaverbuster counter doesn't tick down, at least... it didn't for me. I had a game where I played Sona support, in ranked. The enemy team remade the game. I went back into the queue after they remade, and I had to wait another 20 minutes. I had to wait 45-ish minutes to get into a single game.\n\nIssue 3: This is the worst, the second bug; The 20 minute timer on the leaverbuster popup window will _randomly_ reset, for no explicable reason. This means that, while I'm waiting for the leaverbuster popup to go away so I can immediately find a match, it will randomly reset, taking the punishment from the original, intended 20 minutes to something akin to an eternity. \n\nThis infuriates me, as someone who feels as though this punishment was unfairly inflicted on me, and has not brought it up yet to RIOT officials, and deciding to wait out the punishment. I have, in the past, been quite toxic and done my fair share of crappy things on LoL, but I have a new attitude toward the game, and I had high hopes of climbing as a Mid/Sup main this next season. However, things like this, they're the little bugs that make the game _completely unplayable_ for someone who just casually wants to enjoy playing the game. I nearly quit league of legends because of this bug, and the only thing that retained my interest for the game, despite this infuriating problem, was my love for the game, my interest in the new runes system, all of my good friends who play the game, and my love for youtubers and streamers who are so gosh darn good at this game and inspire me to be more than I currently am.\n\nThe image I have along with this post is an image I screenshotted of me in the Queue, having waited for nearly 10 minutes, and still having something like 17 on the clock.\n\n**_AS I WRITE THIS POST_** I'm sitting in that very same queue, with 23:30 on the queue timer, and 16:50 on the leaverbuster popup.\n\n**_PLEASE, GET THIS FIXED!_**","replies":[{"poster":"C9 Satoshi","date":"2017-12-08T03:00:42.780+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://imgur.com/a/2bJQf","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-08T03:50:17.166+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeeeaaa it definitely looks like that timer reset for some weird reason.
