I&#039;m a casual person who plays for fun. I learned when I cracked under the pressure of either needing to carry or relying on others to carry me, and getting hardstuck bronze that ranked and competitive just wasn&#039;t for me. So keep in mind while responding that I&#039;m not a competitive player, and even though I want to win, it&#039;s norms.\r\n\r\nNow that I&#039;ve got that out of the way, I want to bring up an issue that I&#039;ve been having while working on my season 8 builds for my favorite junglers like Master Yi, {{champion:11}} Jax, {{champion:24}}  and sometimes my good pal Mums {{champion:32}} , among numerous others.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that all of the keystones pretty much are centered around interacting with champions, and I&#039;m having a hard time choosing keystones that can help me with a healthy clear because of it. The reason I&#039;m not super interested in keystones that interact with champs is because I really love the split push style of jungling. So it&#039;s really disappointing when I go through the keystones that might be good on different champs, and seeing that nearly every one of them have something to do with champions. The only one I found that doesn&#039;t really have anything to do with champs is unsealed spellbook, which, on a split-push jungle build I suppose could work if you decide to swap to tele...\r\n\r\nBut that&#039;s about it. I really want to run lethal tempo but I also don&#039;t want to have to be fighting a champ to break the 2.5 cap. It&#039;s mildly frustrating, and I&#039;d like to know what you guys would suggest. Thank you for reading, and thank you again if you respond!\r\n\r\nTL:DR; I&#039;m a casual player, and I prefer to play the split push jungle playstyle with my junglers, but I&#039;m having a hard time finding a keystone that would be good for clear and for split pushing, and doesn&#039;t require interaction with champs. Thanks!","replies":[{"poster":"GelsominoKiller","date":"2017-12-21T22:42:48.522+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be honest, I'm glad Riot took this path. The absence of any helpful jungle clear rune finally solved the neverending problem with diversity in the jungle: every champion shoehorned into AtkSpeed and armor runes. What I learnt by jungling is that as long as there is anything that benefits your early clear, everyone would be forced into into it.","replies":[{"poster":"Sparkle","date":"2017-12-22T00:15:17.826+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeahhhh this is what we found with a lot of our early runes testing, honestly. \n\nWe didn't want to hard lock ALL junglers into a single keystone (or even single keystone per Path).

Tank garen is almost a meme at this point with how everyone builds lethality. Noone builds full tank illaoi, and most morde players agree that its best to just build full  ap damage on morde...  with a few people holding out on the triforce stereks build yet. I don't think its an itemization issue. \n\nLast season you could get your tank stats from runes, and then get away with being tanky while having more damage. This season you have to dedicate yourself to being tanky to get the tank runes to work. To top it off you don't get enough damage stats out of the damage trees to just take damage runes and defensive items... They pretty much eliminated the bruiser/juggernaut classes and pigeon holed them into building full tank or full damage. \n\nInb4 you say what about Stereks/black cleaver. Those are mixed tank/damage items. There isn't a good equivalent for ap classes like morde. I just want to build my two defense items, and 3 damage items and be just tanky enough that I can get to them and do my job. Unlike last season no runes allow me to do that.

I mean, you still build Black Cleaver and stuff, but it’s not THAT bad. Normally I go Resolve/Precision with Grasp, Conditioning, and Legend: Tenacity. I build Cleaver, Sunfire, Mercs, Sterak’s, and then build conditional (not necessarily in that order, of course). I win more often than I lose with it.\n\nAlso, I would suggest that you consider altering what you max first with abilities based upon the matchup. If you’ve got a lane opponent you need to poke down, you max Q first. When dealing with duelists like Jax, who are going to be aggressive, you max E and take a point in W early. I’ve even taken W first on rare instances where I have to turtle and play farm simulator.\n\nJust try mixing things up. Remember that Grasp does limitless increase your health, so you’ll be tanky mid/late in most cases.","replies":[{"poster":"Selegun","date":"2017-12-23T03:12:10.103+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Plus one for solid reason.  With durability down around the board it feels very important to buy the things you need rather than pretend they have to be there in the beginning.  \n\nI like taking Resolve/Precision too.  Build something like Titanic Hydra with as much resistance and HP as I can get and let my damage creep ever higher as the game goes on.  With those runes I try to take Demolish and Last Stand so even if I'm in a fight or not I have something solid to contribute.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Selegun","date":"2017-12-23T03:07:42.520+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"With a thought out rune page, yes, that's exactly what I'm asking of you.  Understanding what you need out of a proper page is very important now and this is exactly the time you should be testing out each rune to know why you want it.\n\nLast season.  There isn't a point or argument here because it no longer exists, all I can ask is that you move on and adapt.\n\nTaking Mordekaiser as the example there are plenty of good selections for him.  While Stereks does some to mind the more obvious picks would be Liandries, Wits End and Maw of Malmortious.  By no means would I ever get all of them but one is more than enough to fill in with a rune like Last Stand and Gathering Storm.","replies":[{"poster":"GigglesO","date":"2017-12-23T04:29:04.797+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But I need tank stats out of the runes, of which I cannot get.

Conditioning does not cover those stats needs, and as for the keystones they are almost unusable. \n\nGuardian feels the best, but it doesn't work in a solo lane, and convincing a teammate to help me proc it is difficult. \nGrasp Feels like shit because I can't stack the hp, and the in combat sustain doesn't do enough to make it worth taking. \nCan't get aftershock.","replies":[{"poster":"GigglesO","date":"2017-12-23T05:52:51.411+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But items don't give you enough durability to do anything even if you use runes to supplement damage and build tanky.
