I just need 400 Orange Essence and I would really appreciate it if you gave me just enough RP to get the 5 chest and keys + 10 Orange Essence bundle, if you give me this I will NEVER ask for anything again. Thank You.","replies":[{"poster":"Son of Ornn","date":"2017-09-15T01:55:14.640+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We do trade art for RP when players need a little extra. That said, I took a look at your account and it doesn't look like you have any RP right now. I can still make a trade for a small 'stimpack' of RP, however it won't be enough for you to get the Bundle you want. :(\n\nIf you still want to make the trade for as much as I can give, then hit me up with a sketch of a Poro signed with your Summoner Name and I'll send it your way. But you'll need to acquire more RP on your own to buy the Bundle.","replies":[{"poster":"skullhunter471","date":"2017-09-17T23:54:50.364+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Would the stimpack of Rp be enough to get at least katarina?","replies":[]}]}]}
