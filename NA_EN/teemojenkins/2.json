Presumably, feeding wasn't a strategic decision, so can't be stopped on a whim. It may be difficult for the player, especially if they're against an enemy who can dive them easily, preventing them even from passively sitting under turret. More productive would be to swap lanes, or provide them a gank to get them caught up. Often times, particular champ matchups are just bound to lose, especially if one side can get even a slight edge.\n\nIf a gank isn't feasible, then securing an objective such as dragon or a tower can help instead. Even dropping a ward by their lane can be useful, if you get a chance to swing by. Also note that a gank doesn't have to kill to be effective. If you burn a flash, or leave the enemy at too low health to safely engage, then it can give your ally the breathing room they need to catch up. And sometimes because of the matchup, you just have to do your best to not fall too far behind, and then just outscale late game.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Wrath of Zed","date":"2015-04-29T14:25:41.342+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"Absolutely nothing is accomplished.

I start the game telling my team I am muting them ( I don't actually but I have learned to ignore chat, inb4 fail to communicate I use pings) and take {{champion:11}} {{summoner:11}} {{summoner:12}} and splitpush to take inhibs, because I hate teamfighting with a team that gets on my nerves, and because of previous experiences I dont trust my team anyway. Besides, Yi's team fight is terrible and he is only good for cleanup. However, he pushes waves at light speed and is impossible to 1v1  due to raw stats and true damage. Play around strengths, instead of trying to overcome weaknesses.\n\nUnfortunately it the current meta favors team fight over solopush, but keep practicing and eventually you will get good enough that you can backdoor and win games even with a team that you cannot stand to play with.\n\n{{champion:75}} also works, but much slower at clearing waves and much harder to escape with when the ENTIRE enemy team jumps you 1v5. Can't stand teams who send 3/4 people to jump me, no honor in it and they only won because they were graced with a team that didn't feed, but I guess you play around strengths right?\n\nBefore you say I'm scum for split pushing (even in games where I'm silent I get reported for split pushing even with best k/d on the team) consider this. There was a game where I went 1/0 in lane as Nasus. However, my bot lane and jungler fed enemy cait so hard that she didn't even need her support anymore. So Leona came all the way to opposite side of map and made a permanent home in top lane. It was Quinn top so I couldn't dive on her like usual thanks to Leona, and when jungler came to gank it was 3v1 under my turret so I had no chance of survival. Inb4 you should have roamed to other lanes Quinn never left lane that entire game, and with Leona's help she took the inner turret easily. If I left lane I would have lost inhib instantly. Game was completely ruined by my team, had absolutely no control my lane because Leona camped it half the game, in any other game doing that would have caused her ADC to die multiple times. Too bad my team fed cait to the point that she could win 1v2s. And Quinn had the balls to say \"ez lane ez game\" in post-match.
