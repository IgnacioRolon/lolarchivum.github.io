They were pretty much beaten, but he carried them back into the game after Vi and Teemo got caught in several 2v1 or 3v1 plays.

Also props on the positivity!\n\nI agree.  Long back-and-forth games are so much more fun than 20 minute stomps for both teams.  I think the sweet spot is around 40-50 minutes as long as it isn't too one-sided.  I love it when a round looks over and then the farmed Nasus (or other lategame champ) on the losing team shows up and turns things around.  \n\nBy the way, on a related topic, 20-25 second teamfights are a lot more fun than 4-6 second teamfights...
