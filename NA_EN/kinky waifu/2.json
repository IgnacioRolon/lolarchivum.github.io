Everyone on my team had the same packet loss and lag.\r\nThey're all people I've never played with before, and it's not a LAN party situation. So we're not sharing the same network/internet.\r\n\r\nAll of my browser pages load fine, and there's 0 lag issues with any other game, as confirmed by one of my team mates too. (Like Overwatch and Rocket League are running fine).\r\n\r\nSo one of the servers must be acting weird?\r\n\r\nWould love feedback.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-21T20:50:53.162+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I looked into your match and everyone was able to finish the match, which is good.  If everyone was truly impacted by delays, then something like an ISP or some server hiccup could have been the culprit.  \n\nI don't see anything odd going on right now, but I'll keep an eye out just in case.
