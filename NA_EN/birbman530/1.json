And my entire team reported me cause they were toxic and hated me. Now I try my best to follow the rules. The first had a toxic MF support who said we banned their other supports. Had no keystones and said that they wouldn't go the free one because they wanted to carry. The second game had a toxic Tristana malzahar and soraka. They were spamming noob rengar please report. I said almost nothing bad that game or the earlier one. No racism homophobia etc. Compared to them I wasn't toxic at all. And i got banned? Riot is there anything you can do? I can't submit a support ticket cause I can't log in there.

There are a lot of arrogant and disrespectful people out there. Riot doesn't understand that people being mad over a gank, for example, then starting to harass with speeches like \"go die somewhere else useless noob\" is way more toxic than those who retaliate. Not to mention half the time ur not even the one at fault they are the ones who messed up. They are probably a much worse human being than you are.\n\nThen Riot comes in and be like \"WOW a hate speech damn! perma banned\". When in reality, everyone is racist and got their own stereotypes. The piece of arrogant shit that harassed you for messing up is prob more racist than anyone lol! \n\nNOT TO MENTION UR PRESIDENT is using hate speech all the time? Heck, I guarantee there are some trump supporters within riot employees who ironically worked on the punishment system! Riot needs to start picking off the super passively toxic players, those are the real bad people, rather than making a huge deal at the ones who retaliate lol.","replies":[{"poster":"BirbMan530","date":"2017-08-06T05:09:49.999+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks.

I don't have any punishment atm, just that I can relate to you. Like you, I also retaliate to people who harass me. However 2 years ago I did get a 14day ban, for saying ww2 Japanese Soldiers are war criminals and Japan should treat them like one like how Germany does to their fallen Nazis, instead of honoring and paying respect to them. Apparently Riot thinks that's racist/hate speech. By that logic I swear if u yell \"Nazis are war criminals\" in chat will get u banned lol.
