But basically the past four games of league I have attempted to play have been ruined by this problem. In a nutshell, my internet is perfectly fine, I have 40 ping, and then all of a sudden it will \"attempt to reconnect\" for 20 seconds or so, go to exactly 500 ping, then it will go back down to 40 ping and I can play. This has been happening every 2 or 3 minutes. At first I thought it was just my internet, but some of my friends are having the exact same problem, and quite a few other people in game have been complaining about it.\r\n\r\nI was just wondering if anyone knows about this and/or having the same problem? I just want to know how to fix it so I can go back to playing my favorite game :)","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-10T21:25:40.065+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Though your internet might appear fine, it can still have problems specifically connecting to our game server.
