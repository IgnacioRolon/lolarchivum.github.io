I don't personally feel Kha'zix has ever had great evolutionary choice, instead mainly having periods there was a clearly better choice but not everyone had figured out which one it was.\n\nWhile I'm not a Kha'Zix player, I'd be curious to see your thoughts on these rough suggestions -- I think a lot of Kha'Zix's evolution issues stem from the obvious utility / power that some of his abilities grant him in pretty much every situation: he always wants more damage, and always wants more mobility, so Q and E *must* be taken.\n\nHere's some thoughts on tweaks off the top of my head -- power might need to be cut elsewhere on his kit to accommodate these sort of additions, but I do think it leads to a healthier evolution choice.\n\n------\n\n**Taste Their Fear**\n*New Passive:* Increases damage to isolated targets as X amount as Kha'Zix gains levels (this makes his damage spike less at 6, but also reduces the need to level this ability to maximize your assassination ability).\n***New Evolution:*** Increases the range of Kha'Zix's basic attacks and *Taste Their Fear* by 50. The radius for calculating an *Isolated* target decreases, and decreases further the more Kha'Zix attacks the target.\n\n*--These changes make this the \"hunter\" selection, allowing you to isolate an enemy and then keep chasing them down even as they run towards their friends. A persistent Kha'Zix can deal tremendous damage to a target even close to their team if he catches them out of position with enough time to get a few hits in.--*\n\n---------\n\n**Void Spikes**\n*Altered Active:* Now always fires 3 spikes in a cone. Healing is increased against monsters (this helps his jungle clear a little bit, while making the ability just feel more impactful early on, even if the damage doesn't increase at all).\n***New Evolution:*** Targets struck are slowed by 30% for 2 seconds, increasing by 25% and .5 seconds for each additional spike to strike them, to a maximum of 80% slow for 3 seconds.\n\n*--This gives Kha'Zix a powerful tool for holding a single enemy down once he's near them, making Void Spikes more than a long-range poke tool.--*\n\n-------\n**Leap**\nNo change. *Leap*'s evolution is great for Kha'Zix's who want very high mobility and greater safety. *Maybe* consider resetting it on Large Monster kills as well, to make it a more interesting choice for jungle invading and counter-jungling / hunting.\n\n------\n\n**Void Assault**\n***New Evolution:*** *Void Assault* can be cast a total of 3 times, and the movement speed bonus is increased to 60%. Scoring a Takedown grants Kha'Zix a single free use of *Void Assault*, usable within 15 seconds even if the ability is on cooldown. Using a free *Void Assault* in this fashion does not active the normal ultimate.\n\n*--This gives Kha'Zix a less reliable escape than a *Leap* evolution, but can still make him slippery or allow him to chain together a series of dives into teams.\n\n----------\nThis gives us a couple of really flexible final evolutions paths.\n\nQ/E/R is about being slippery in fights, getting to targets, and hunting them down even in teamfights, albeit over an extended kill time to shrink the attack radius.\n\nQ/W/E is about hunting targets down using your high mobility and ability to prevent their escape.\n\nW/E/R is for getting picks with your team by closing to priority targets and holding them in place, although your own damage may drop a bit.\n\nQ/W/R is the all-in combat strategy, maximizing your damage and lock-down at the expense of an easy escape.\n\nQ is probably the worst early choice -- R gives you stronger ganking power and some escaping, E gives you very high mobility, W gives you powerful CC on your ganks.\n\n----------\n\nThoughts? The Q might need adjustment, but I think the other three are all highly appealing in their own rights. I had debated putting an AoE fear effect on nearby allies if *Taste Their Fear* hits a target enough, but that felt like it might be too powerful.","replies":[{"poster":"Divewing","date":"2015-11-21T13:03:58.610+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I reckon considering he has his leap, the free-ult-charge shouldnt get MS buff, otherwise, omega good job","replies":[]},{"poster":"Aceatbl4ze","date":"2015-11-21T12:40:57.359+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think you are a genius , i hope someone out there can hear you","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Cloud273","date":"2015-11-21T01:32:51.195+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":26,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=iygfWEQv,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-11-21T01:17:03.834+0000)\n>\n> Short term: A base armor increase and a reduction to Q's mana cost\n> \n> Longer term: **We're seeing a number of AD assassins, Kha'zix and Zed especially, struggle after the preseason changes.** We believe that's due to the removal of Brutalizer and changes to Last Whisper.

Zix is more-so just the fact he's got so much of his power put into his isolation and the last nerfs he got was an increase in the isolation range while also making turrets count against isolation. He lost his snowbally turret diving, which was fine, but he also lost his ability to gank many lanes unless they were pushed really, really far.\n\nOverall, Zix's early damage is pretty sub-par, but his late game burst on a squishy can near one-shot them. His ratios are off the charts on isolated targets with his Q doing nearly as much damage as Morde's 3rd Q, but instead of being a quick ramp up, it's just an instant burst -if- they're isolated. It just feels weird to have a champ scale so well, but ONLY if they're isolated...\n\nConsidering Zix has no real damage on his ult, it could be possible to turn his passive into physical damage and have his Q be able to apply it at the cost of his Q being nerfed slightly. Possibly, change the Q increase from huge damage when isolated to slightly elevated damage on isolated while applying his passive. His passive would not only need to be changed to physical, but it would need an AD ratio on it. The only issue with this idea is that his Q would lose power against monsters, though that could be fixed by increasing the damage against monsters like what his W was given. This would allow him to jungle well, his R evolution would be worth picking up since you'd choose between more slow on your W plus more AoE OR you'd get more damage. As is, his passive is nothing more than the slow it provides. With this, he could still scare people out of his jungle with the isolation, clear his jungle well, be able to gank, and he wouldn't have to suffer nearly as much if two people stand 400 units from each other or one person standing the same distance from a minion or turret. \n\nSo, his evolved Q and R would go well together, E is always going to be picked up. Possible his W could proc his passive when evolved, though at half the power. That would make each of his evolutions be worth picking up, though each of them would be for specific things. More Q damage for Q, more poke for W, E is a guaranteed, and R would be if you wanted to give your evolved Q or W more damage.

Jayce went down 11 places in top, and 15 in mid. Zed went down 20 places in mid. But Riven took the hardest hit and went from being a very strong champion to being one of the worst, going down 39 places. In terms of how much the patch impacted champions negatively, Riven probably took the hardest hit. This is not surprising, because in almost every game in solo queue and competitive play, Riven would purchase brutalizer.

So with that it makes it difficult to play him in the jungle, his clear is bad, his ganks are easy to play around for winning lanes and he's easy to invade.\n\nMy suggestion would be to either massively increase W damage to minions, or add an item Kha'Zix can rush to AoE clear camps. Or you could change it so jungle monsters are always isolated even when nearby small monsters.\n\nTBH Kha'Zix was affected by a lot more than just the decreased clear this patch though, since you guys reduced jungle income by 22-24 gold per camp (by removing the gold off jungle items but not adding it back onto the camp, I feel like you forgot about that) Sure you gave 6-8 gold to all the camps but with the massive increase in item prices, and the fact that everyone else gets more gold except junglers and AP supports, you've not only completely ruined farm junglers but you have hurt certain carry junglers such as Kha'Zix who already struggled by being lower level and now struggle further by having massively less gold than the rest of the game. As a jungle main I am currently avoiding jungle and playing anything even top over jungle, top may have to deal with all the most stupidly powerful champions but at least they can get items. Please add that gold back to the camps.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CrazedPorcupine","date":"2015-11-21T06:25:23.975+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Has it been considered to do a moderate rework in the same vein as Viktor?\n\nPerhaps make it so that he has more ways to unlock evolutions, Perhaps through killing units/champions, and adding more evolutionary steps into abilities?","replies":[]},{"poster":"ExecutorDill","date":"2015-11-21T06:22:37.715+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=iygfWEQv,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-11-21T01:17:03.834+0000)\n>\n> Short term: A base armor increase and a reduction to Q's mana cost\n> \n> Longer term: We're seeing a number of AD assassins, Kha'zix and Zed especially, struggle after the preseason changes.

Naw.. He OP as hell LoL.\n\nTo be honest I do think zed can use a bit of love, but after the S6 itemization I believe he is in a great spot (he is stil the long range poke assassin with best resource sustain, and lane safety due to his W and R making flash an emergeny only spell. Yea the ULT change on PBE will change will help him out a lot (especially woth this top and mid meta) but I still find him extremely oppressive against alot mid laners for this fact i'd rather a smaller buff or none at all.\n\nAs for Kha I don't play him so I can't say much. I did heard that the absence of Ranger's Trailblazer hit him pretty hard, (tbh I never liked that item, all it gave was an early game farm spike and then completely useless later on) but from what meddler said^ he should be good again after the short term changes a litte armor and reduced mana costs can go a long way in the jungle.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yuumis Magicbook","date":"2015-11-21T06:22:13.390+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You guys always forget about talon :( he can't even use his combo efficiently because his autoreset on q is so clunky","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kuro n Shiro","date":"2015-11-21T04:04:09.711+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=iygfWEQv,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-11-21T01:17:03.834+0000)\n>\n> Short term: A base armor increase and a reduction to Q's mana cost\n> \n> Longer term: We're seeing a number of AD assassins, Kha'zix and Zed especially, struggle after the preseason changes.

Most of her player base has over 125 games on her and since the patch her win rate has plummeted from 53~% to about 43% which is an insane drop on a champion with such a high base game pool. IIRC there was a riot post on how a champions balance should show a higher win rate if the average player has \"mastered\" or spent a lot of time on that champion yet Riven hasn't gotten any attention since the patch even though she is incredibly weak with the nerfs to Tiamat, Ionian Boots, Brutalizer, Masteries and CDR in general.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Finrar","date":"2015-11-21T03:48:16.479+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You had a choice between W and R(dmg reduction ) at one point (even e if you really wanted it.) .\nwhat i'm trying to get at is that Zed gets buffs towards his damage aswell and Kha'zix only gets 3 Armour and a -5 mana cost? i call tough love. \n_that might of sounded rude but don't take it that way plz ;-; i just want murder bug back_\nAnd about that new item, do you think it will be close to old Last Whisper?","replies":[]},{"poster":"kasfas","date":"2015-11-21T02:45:54.152+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Despite not playing assassins much myself,( they align very poorly with my 'brute force it' playstyle ) this seems great.

Also since slows don't stack anymore, his passive and w don't need them both.
