It kept saying my password was wrong yet I know it was right I just logged on 2 minutes before to get into the game I was in. I end up not getting back in for 2 hours and still kept using the same password and what do you know I get a leavebuster for 20 minutes for 5 games. I've been playing since Season 1... I might not play anymore if stuff like this is gonna happen","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-22T02:15:06.942+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been seeing a number of people having this weird login issue, but that shouldn't have been the cause of you being kicked out of a game to begin with. Let's make sure we get to the bottom of why you ended up out of that match in the first place. \n\nThere wasn't a lot of information to go off of as to why you were out of the match, but it almost sounds like you were disconnected from the servers. If that's the case, make sure to double check your [**network settings**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) for anything that might be a little off, that way we can keep you in those games and not get any more penalties.","replies":[{"poster":"GavsterV1","date":"2017-05-22T16:43:14.820+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know I was disconnected because of my network but I am able to easily log back in and get in the game within seconds. The problem was getting back into the login screen. It kept saying my password was wrong and I know for a fact it was right. Its been the same for 3 years and hasn't changed. Thats were I believe I shouldn't be in leavebusters. All I ask is that you take it away. It would be much appreciated.","replies":[]}]}]}
