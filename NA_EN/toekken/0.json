My mouse can move around, but left/right click do not work, my keyboard nothing works.  I have tried deleting the Config folder and also reinstalling, nothing seems to work.  I have all the correct ports forwarded as well.  I can get in the game, see minions spawn, see chat, but cannot chat or perform any action or move.  Any help would be greatly appreciated since I cannot play the game at all.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-13T21:36:00.045+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's a bummer to hear the config reset didn't help in this case.  Do you have any software running that interact with your key inputs or mapping?  What happens if you try another mouse and keyboard in case of a hardware issue?  I'm not sure that this is a connection issue, but it was a good step to take just in case.  Let me know if you can try out those steps and help rule out some possibilities.","replies":[{"poster":"CriticalManatee","date":"2017-06-27T20:31:54.462+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"please come up with a fix im also having the same issues :(","replies":[]}]}]}
