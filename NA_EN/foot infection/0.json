Since qss is on a shorter CD and Snowball, Heal, Barrier, Clarity, and Flash are so much better there's almost 0 reason to use cleanse in ARAM. So i think if cleanse could get rid of the snowball mark making the person who threw the snowball unable to travel to the hit player I think it would become a pretty popular summoner spell in ARAM.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-11T22:21:00.821+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Y'know, I kinda think this makes sense too personally. We aren't on the design team here on the boards, so you should definitely post this over in the Gameplay board to get more attention to this suggestion.","replies":[]}]}
