It does so extremely efficiently, but in the process it sometimes loses the detail of the original font.\n\nTo answer you actual question: There was, at least at some point in the past, a bug that would make the chat logs not display properly. Your best bet here is to write a support ticket. Worst-case they'll give you the actual full chat logs, best-case they'll revert the punishment because the single line \"lol\" is obviously not punishable.","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2020-02-06T22:23:31.692+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=TrulyBland,realm=EUNE,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=rTau2hNe,comment-id=0009,timestamp=2020-02-06T14:16:45.511+0000)\n>\n> Because I've seen this stuff before, and it's usually an issue with the way PNG compresses text.

PNG doesn't care whether it's compressing an image of text or of anything else, and doesn't lose detail anywhere, because it's a lossless format.","replies":[{"poster":"TrulyBland","date":"2020-02-07T10:04:17.695+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Huh... got some stuff mixed up then, I suppose. Thought PNG had both lossy and lossless options.\n\nStill, I've seen this before, and I remember it being solved as compression / file format related. As said in a different post: If it was just the result of editing, that doesn't explain why the rest of the text is also screwed up.\n\nEdit: Can't seem to find anything in this regard though, right now. Guess I'll just have to eat my words and leave it at that.\n\nEdit2: Looked at the image a bit more in detail, and yeah… It seems like the problem is a whole lot simpler than that.
