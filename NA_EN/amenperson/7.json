This is a question. \r\n\r\nSo I main Cho&#039;Gath who has the ability to deal a shit ton of True Damage and get a bonus if he kills them with said True Damage ability, but I always seem to mess up when it comes to people with passives that can revive them, like {{champion:266}} , {{champion:34}} , and {{champion:154}} . \r\n\r\nNow I&#039;m just wondering, that like with Aatrox he gets the GA effect around him, is there any way to tell if Anivia&#039;s or Zac&#039;s passive is currently up, apart from relying on your team to tell you when a passive is blown and then for you to mentally make note of when it happened. \r\n\r\nAgain, this isn&#039;t a complaint or a rant, this is just me wondering if there is anything in game that gives me this information.","replies":[{"poster":"Valor Bot","date":"2017-07-04T08:51:18.055+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's no visual effect like Aatrox's for Zac or Anivia; however, you can click on them in-game and look at the small character sheet that appears at the top left of the screen to see if they have their revive passives up. Anivia's will be a blue egg icon (and the icon will turn grey when it's on cooldown); Zac's will be a green blob icon. I like to check whether they have the buff or not before I commit to fighting any one of them.","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-07-04T09:17:10.372+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is it glitchy? because a few games ago i went against an anivia and when i look at her she had no icon but still had her egg","replies":[{"poster":"Valor Bot","date":"2017-07-04T09:34:50.718+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds like a bug; it should show the Rebirth icon by default if Anivia has it available.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-07-04T08:48:57.930+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"dont believe there is. it's just something you have to actually see and keep a timer on","replies":[]}]}
