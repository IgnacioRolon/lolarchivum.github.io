But it would still be nice to see this item back in the game, just for old times sake. It&#039;d just be nice to have. \n\n~~And potentially watch someone explode in a glorious way again.~~\n\nEdit: There is constant replies of not needing it back because we have {{item:3907}} {{item:3151}} {{item:3001}} and {{item:3285}} , which were suppose to be the replacements for the item, and there for we do not need DFG. \n\nWhile yes, the end result of both sets of items are the same, the path leading to the is completely different, and is more efficient for DFG. Hell, if they were to just tune everything down by an 11 on DFG, that way it fits better with everything I'd love that. I personally just want to see DFG itself back in the game, and not be a knock off version someone threw together and put a label on saying it's the exact same.
