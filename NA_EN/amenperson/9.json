Not only does she have her new w, but she automatically uses her old e whenever she picks up a knife.

Only difference is that instead you aiming your kit to kill something you pray for a lucky Q drop or pray someone to be stupid and walk near your dropped. You lose the movement speed + Damage combo which can be used to slow enemies like udyr and Yi while chasing you... You lose your jumping over walls potential to escape, you lose your bush troll plays to escape. You basically get 1 chance, to throw an item that everyone can see and you can shunpo on to \"escape\" or \"deal damage\", which is basically pointless, because First dagger (q) is based on luck if there's a minion who will take 5th bounce and throw it in a horrible location or if the enemy is blind and doesn't see your W location. \nThis drops the skill needed, increases the luck. Her kit losses potential and gains lucktential...\n\nKatarina 2016 -  Be good and destroy.\nKatarina 2017 - spray and pray. - If this is full potential as they described it, I feel sorry for her. Once one of the greatest blademasters in runeterra, now a luck based knife thrower...","replies":[{"poster":"AmenPerson","date":"2016-10-19T08:26:18.079+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The position the Q lands is not random though. You do have control over where it lands. In the ability description, it says \"The dagger always lands on the opposite side from where it struck the first target, getting there in the same amount of time regardless of how many times it bounces.\" So you do have control on where it lands, which is right behind the first thing hit, it's not at all close to spray and pray. And it's now 2 bounces, not 5. So it will hit the first target, bounce to two more if available, and then land behind the first target. \n\nAnd I'm sorry, it's clear you're a Katarina main, but the whole point of the Assassin Update was to give assassin's more potential, as well as give other players more counter-play. Because I can tell you, it's not fun walking back to lane, and then just dead with no way to counter. That's what Riot doesn't want. \n\nWith Katarina and her Q, it's very obvious for both the player, and the opponent, to tell where her knife is going to land, and there is where the counter play is shown. If only the player knew where the Q was going to land, then the opponent would be at a huge disadvantage.","replies":[{"poster":"zrWQMdGHtY","date":"2016-10-19T08:36:47.828+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"WAIT WAIT, I didn't see any 2 bounces from 5 drop?! WTF is the point to paly her after the rework then!?!? ATM  a 1000 AD Jhin can OS me before I can even shunpo! Now he can OS me because I'm too busy waiting for my Q to drop so I can land my passive and deal some dmg, BUT same time I cant eliminate enemies via minions anymore? Okay... RIP I'm done, no point ot keep playing, they totally gutted her... This rework is just her end not her \"full potential\", no matter how \"Fun \" it is for people to free shunpo around aimlessly... This is just a massive gut... \"Buffed her lane phase\" I don't see a lane phase buff, you cant poke. YOu are forced to IN the range of the enemy so they can bash you will all their spells, so you can get few minions from a 2 bounce spell XDDD nah... Okay... I'm done arguing about it, clearly Riot wanted me to leave the game for good so this was it...\n\nP.S U cant put counter play on Katarina and remove it from 99% of the other champs. Add counter play to Irelia first and then complain what counter play Kat needs. Or to Ekko, or to fizz, or to other over-powered current meta beasts... Losses her potential with Rylai to slow brusers and escape, losses the potential to escape tanks, she lost all her current potential for literally nothing in return... And she losses her WARD jump for 0 reason at all !

It hits 5, but it bounces to 4. The PBE it hits 3, but bounces to 2. That's what I meant. I had gotten confused. \n\nBut well, you've made your decision and I don't think I could deter you from leaving an actually pretty fun game, or try to convince to possibly, you know, adjust to changes. But I would say, just watch some of the current videos about her rework, like Redmercy, or from other League YouTubers, and you can tell, that her ability to kill and all that, is not gone. She is still \"Hey you're dead\". \n\nSo just make your decisions, but I'm telling you, just change to the new way she plays. She still plays pretty good.","replies":[{"poster":"zrWQMdGHtY","date":"2016-10-19T11:50:28.605+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1 hit + 4 bounces its total 5 as I clearly stated earlier... 3 hits is nothing and this spell is useless now... because I got 0 poke anymore ...

She's not \"hey I got control of this\" she's \"hey I need luck and u to be stupid to do this\" I want what I learned 8 years, the first rework didn't hit her at all, but this is totally a buzz kill...","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Evewynn","date":"2016-10-19T08:20:26.005+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well the q knife destination is fixed and always relative to the original target, regardless of how the knife bounces. Also you can still shunpo over walls to wards, it just doesn't get the cooldown reset.\n\nThere is no RNG in this kit. It's all fixed and can be planned around. If you don't like the changes, fine, but you can't blame RNG for it.","replies":[{"poster":"zrWQMdGHtY","date":"2016-10-19T08:23:19.559+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can't. Ward jump is removed. Read the changes... The Q falls at the last target it hits, not the original location and even if it goes to the original location, do you think there's a point, because it needs 1-2 secs to do all 5 bounces and the target I need to hit with my passive is already got for the period the knife falls...\n\nFrom all I saw there's nothing fixed, it's fully luck based and less mobility than before... Your \"buffed \"mobility as they call it is on INSIDE combat zone, in a game where basic attacks are auto targeted and not like in OW, dodgeble by changing locations fast... If the basic attacks were \"aim to hit\" then this is a huge mobility buff, now ? Not at all...","replies":[{"poster":"Evewynn","date":"2016-10-19T08:35:06.932+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh, it's a shame about the ward hop removal. If it's that much of a hit I'm sure she'll be compensated. I was never really a fan of it existing, but I know it was a strong part of her kit.\n\nThe purpose of the knife I'm pretty sure is to extend the time of assassination, while making her more reliable in cases where the opponent has more time to see her coming. It's definitely different, but I wouldn't write it off just yet.","replies":[{"poster":"zrWQMdGHtY","date":"2016-10-19T08:43:35.650+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She isn't, stop nagging how this new shunpo is better, it way worse...
