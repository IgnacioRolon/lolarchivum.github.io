Reaping will commence. Now!&quot; or Shadow Assassin&#039;s &quot;I am chosen! The Darkin stain lives no more.&quot; \r\n\r\nAnd I say this not hating Kayn, as I actually love that edgy teenager and sarcastic murderous weapon. Just would feel like a nice QoL touch to him. \r\n\r\n~~Although this is Riot we&#039;re talking about here, so they would never really focus on and add a QoL voice line change to a champion~~","replies":[{"poster":"ZenaSpiritdragon","date":"2017-12-02T23:36:10.448+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree, that would be pretty cool.
