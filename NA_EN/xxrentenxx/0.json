I was looking to download a really cool \"Rick and Morty\" voice pack, but refrained from doing so after reading stories of people being permanently banned for using voice packs. Though people tend to bend the truth about why they were banned and the nature of their offence to gain the favor of fellow players. I wanted to confirm whether or not it is a serious enough offense to change the announcer for summoner's rift just to get more joy out of the game. It wouldn't give me any advantages or disadvantages, just something fun to listen to while playing league of legends.\r\n\r\nAlso, I'm not really a forums guy so I'm not sure if this was posted in the correct place. I hope so. Thanks!~","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-08T16:32:24.176+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As amazing as Ricky and Morty might be, we don't support any third party programs or modifications and doing it is at your own risk.
