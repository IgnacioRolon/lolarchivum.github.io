Sometime when I use Jhin&#039;s Dancing Grenade, it happens to bounce 2 time and then disappear even though there are more targets after the second bounce and they are in range. I am Jhin main and I know that is not normal. The first time I mentioned the bug was a week ago and it happened 3-4 times. Today I played Jhin again and it happened again around 3-4 times. It usually happens when I throw it on a minion wave and after the second minion the grenade just disappears. I am looking forward on fixing the bug.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-03-28T17:07:31.687+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Morning ReaIm Of Shadows! \n\nThanks for the report!
