It's written in FAQ that you won't get refunded either for crafting the wrong icon blueprint or any at all. We're more in the same boat.\n\nThey didn't want us to know about it anyway. I've been scrolling that disruption FAQ page and there was nowhere written ANYTHING about the phase 2. Not even the existence of the 2nd phase of event. Shame on you riot for that one. Not that i care about some skin, but it's the common sense.","replies":[]}]}
