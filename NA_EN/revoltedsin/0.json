I just hope to get reply from Riot regarding this","replies":[{"poster":"Tiza","date":"2016-05-07T20:01:20.035+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"First, and most importantly: Riot does not ban League of Legends events.

They would rather put on a quality tournament than some shit show where it's not in their native language with really high ping.

But the guy from ESL India was telling us that they tried to host an experimental tournament in india, and Riot shut it down completely by sending a mail to ESL HQ. Is this true? Or the ESL guy is lying? If he's lying cant you take any action against them?","replies":[{"poster":"Tiza","date":"2016-05-09T21:51:23.846+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=revoltedsin,realm=NA,application-id=9hBQwnEU,discussion-id=I1aV2HyQ,comment-id=00030001,timestamp=2016-05-08T07:52:25.556+0000)\n>\n> So yeah, Riot doesn&#x27;t ban anyone from hosting lol tournaments and has never stopped ESL from hosting one.

My immediate reaction is that we absolutely did not send a letter to ESL to tell them not to host LoL tournaments, but I will be up front and say that I don't know the details of the situation.  Regardless, even if someone lied, that doesn't mean that ESL has to start running tournaments or there will be a public resolution.  What kind of action are you looking for?","replies":[{"poster":"revoltedsin","date":"2016-05-19T17:28:03.231+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Tiza,realm=NA,application-id=9hBQwnEU,discussion-id=I1aV2HyQ,comment-id=000300010000,timestamp=2016-05-09T21:51:23.846+0000)\n>\n> We&#x27;re looking into it with ESL.

Won't there be any sanctions regarding defamation and using Riot's name in false statements? They are completely clear regarding the untrue incident and people will blame Riot for it....I don't think such policies exist in gaming tho","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"ezio011","date":"2016-05-06T21:13:10.222+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We need league...
