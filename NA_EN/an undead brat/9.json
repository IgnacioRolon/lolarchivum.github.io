So now she either is on the wrong side of the wall with enemy with only her E as \"cc\" to defend herself. Don't get me wrong though, I've played her and trapped people but 9/10 times people will just cross it with no problem before I get there. One memorable time is trapping a gragas and mundo, gragas flahed over and mundo...well mundo had a bad time. But the thing is I needed allies to kill them, like i said Taliyah does no damage unless she's constantly moving thanks to her shitty worked ground mechanic.","replies":[]},{"poster":"UB3R 1337 H4X","date":"2016-06-13T13:20:04.912+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=zlumpy,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=O80As0gM,comment-id=00060000,timestamp=2016-06-13T05:24:33.039+0000)\n>\n> Wait wait wait....theres another mage that can make a wall blocking enemy champs into a surefire death scenarion from super far away AND come riding in to kill them if they try to dash over the wall!?

TBH if the pros really learn her strengths they would murder a lane badly if someone stays in reserve on the safe side of the wall to catch a flash.  Can you imagine azir support or Allistar support that just sits back on the other side and just bumpers people back in all the time?  And with the support changes coming soon there may very well be a good option to anti vision (hopefully) to make stuff like that a thing.
