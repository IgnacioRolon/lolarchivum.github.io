Slayer, firecracker, and now sg. \n2. Prior to SG, she only had 4 skins, which is less than a vast majority of champions. There are only 11 champions that had less than she did, 5 champions with 2 skins, and 6 champions with 3. \n\nhow anyone is going to complain about jinx getting a new skin is beyond me.","replies":[{"poster":"An Undead brat","date":"2016-09-20T17:28:54.625+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well I'd bet it was 4 lol :'D\n\nAnd then this is not about total skin amount, it's about the amount of skins in the short period of time.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2016-09-20T07:47:38.431+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's situational, a big point being who in these roles would fit this theme that's currently being worked on the best along with these other champions and their own personalities that could clash with these skins.\n\nThere's that or they could just pick a champion favorite and drop a skin on them because that's what most people want.","replies":[{"poster":"An Undead brat","date":"2016-09-20T08:22:53.322+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Yeah, Jinx really fits in Star GUARDIAN theme........","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2016-09-20T19:48:08.985+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"She actually fit's the theme well.
