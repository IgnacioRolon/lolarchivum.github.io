Since then, I was waiting for a new skin for my love. I was so hyped up when I saw the teaser. Now that we can see the preview, I must say, I love the spell effects and model, except ONE thing:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/QkK19myCFPQ?nodirect\n\n**Does she really need to have those wings on her ass?**\n\nLike... It looks like she was from some kind of a bad anime solely because of that! I don&#039;t know who came up with this anatomic bullshit, but it is absolutely contrary to anything esthetic. PLEASE, consider putting them on her back/shoulders normally, even if it takes one more patch, I&#039;ll gladly wait, I managed to wait for two and half a year!\n\nThank you for reading this,\nPassionate player and infinite Zyra lover\n*Sexy Bisex Plant*\n\nEdit: I see, all of you guys agree in comments, please, upvote this post also so Rioters can see it, thank you! <3","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2017-02-23T21:20:13.950+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi! I wanted to drop in with a bit of context here - you're right in that they're not anatomically correct, and that was done purposefully. In the case of Dragon Sorceress Zyra, we took a bit of creative freedom, and made something that was a bit more outside the box in terms of design, and in return, sacrificed practicality.","replies":[{"poster":"midnight oil24","date":"2017-02-23T21:34:10.462+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why does her recall look so similar to demon vi's?","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2017-02-23T21:51:18.232+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"While I do see what you mean regarding Demon Vi, they both utilize wings, so there will be some overlap.
