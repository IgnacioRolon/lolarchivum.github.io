I'm having problem with login into LoL. I play on EUNE server but today \"your account has been transfered to another region\". I'm now writing from my 2nd account which has the same ID and PSWD, but region is different. My EUNE summoner name is Dzyzas. Also I was not able to find the new region of my account. It just says it has been changed but I tried to login on ALL possible servers and it is always the same error.
