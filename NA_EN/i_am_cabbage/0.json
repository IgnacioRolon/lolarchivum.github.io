I pitched my idea of the skin to them and they liked what they heard about it, so I asked whoever did to sign a poster saying that they support it.\nYou can see this here: [Support poster!](http://i.imgur.com/OhdTFq2.jpg) Each +1 beside a name or at the top right represents a rioter that supports the skin.\n\nA couple said I should try and get some community support behind this, so here I go. \n\nHere is a quick sketchup design from  reddit user \"TechnoScherzo\"\n[Picture!](http://i.imgur.com/yVfCfR4.png)\n\n**The Skin**\n**The Scythe**: A scythe made from old busted up computer parts, the staff part made from a tangle of wires, and the scythe blade itself made from old computer boards. EX: Sound cards, video cards, ram sticks..... etc.\n\n**The Cloak**: A blue cloak, patterned with 1s and 0s to represent binary, and possibly a hidden message within them, with wires draping down the cloak as well. \n\n**The Spellbook**: Instead of a spellbok, he carries around an old discarded Laptop\n\n**Spells**\n\n**Death Defied**: When Karthus dies and becomes a ghost, with the skin he begins to seemingly glitch out as the passive times out, eventually fizzling into nothing.\n\n**Lay Waste**: Blue bubble bursts from the ground glitching up\n\n**Defile**: The active portion of Defile causes 1s and 0s to circle around him and rise out of the ground\n\n**Wall of Pain**: Firewall of pain. Places a firewall in the targeted area\n\n**Requim**: 1's and 0's and a bunch of random text appears above the champion. Killing them causes their screen to be a tinted blue instead of the grey. Kind of like when Zilean ults a champion there's a gold glow\n\n**Animations**\n\n**Dance**: Possibly a play on Steve Balmers \"Developers\" presentation\n\n**Taunt**: \"I don't need to crash you, I can defeat you the old fashioned way\" Could also have special interaction with mechanical champions : Blitzcrank, Oriana, Viktor, Heimerdinger.\n\n**Joke**: \"bugsplat? Hah, child's play.\"\n\nI am open for absolutely any suggestions, especially since I am not the most creative person out there. \n\n[Link to reddit thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/2nwx5a/skin_concept_idea_blue_screen_of_death_karthus/)\n\n**Update** : I'm so happy to see all of the support this is getting. I really hope this goes through and something happens with this, if you enjoy it, send it to your friends. The more support the better!","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2014-12-03T01:16:55.583+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":0,"body":"TAKE MY MONEY.","replies":[{"poster":"i am cabbage","date":"2014-12-03T01:41:47.918+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Success!
