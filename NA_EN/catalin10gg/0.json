So sad to know that is the truth\n\nThis might be a shocking bit of news:\n\nLeague of Legends, the free to play game which offers the fundamental parts of gameplay (champions, runes, masteries) completely free of charge/ for free in game currency, uses the release of skins to make profits. Players of this for-profit game are more likely to buy skins for champions which they play. Champions that are played by more people are popular champions, and some champions are consistently more popular due to a variety of factors including design, reliability, fun, etc. In order to continue to make profits of increasing returns, Riot will often release skins which people are more likely to buy due to being for champions that are played more often by these people. I don't know if I'd call it love, but it certainly is the truth.","replies":[{"poster":"Placentas","date":"2017-08-23T00:36:45.539+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol, of course you get downvoted for saying the truth.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Malicious Metal","date":"2017-08-22T12:11:20.158+0000","up_votes":50,"down_votes":15,"body":"As expected from Cass mains.\nNot even satisfied when they get a sick ass skin.\n\nThat's pathetic.","replies":[{"poster":"Snaketits","date":"2017-08-22T12:17:32.494+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":22,"body":"That's extremely shortsighted of you.
