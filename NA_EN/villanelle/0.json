I also don't see any indicator and would appreciate keeping this feature. Similar to this on the profile screen it doesn't show how many chests you have available or when you are getting new ones. Again, I'm guessing they'll add it in with an update including hextech crafting.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tiranazaur","date":"2016-07-22T10:02:54.595+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wanted to post this here ======>>> [Prepare to Test: Collection and Profiles](http://boards.eune.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/alpha-client-discussion-en/LpwkErKW) but this is more specific.

They'll probably bring in the indicators around when they implement the store. Hextech links to purchasing chests, and they wouldn't want to do that before they've gotten the store page ready for alpha.","replies":[]}]}
