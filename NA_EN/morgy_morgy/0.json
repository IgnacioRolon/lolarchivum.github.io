Either way, you're getting a report.\n\nThere are plenty of reasons to evaluate a surrender vote and maybe consider a turnaround. However, knowing that you're only there because the enemy team doesn't want to finish is not a situation where you don't surrender. End the game. Click yes. Stop wasting my time.\n\nThe worst part is that with leaverbuster, you CAN'T just DC from the game. The rules force you to sit there for eternity waiting for minions to win because your team won't stop trying to clear out base and the enemy won't push. We need to put a stop to this nonsense. There needs to be a threshold where you've been in a game long enough and are allowed to DC without punishment.","replies":[{"poster":"Mama Soraka","date":"2016-03-19T17:03:45.993+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see posts like this and people complaining like their reports don't feel like they do anything and I just can't muster any sympathy at all.
