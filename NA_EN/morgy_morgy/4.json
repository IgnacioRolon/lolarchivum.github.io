The nuisance AP fizz once was in the mid lane got balanced out and made him a more of a situation pick instead of the insta-lock/perma ban Monster.\n\nThe meta shifted, Tanks/Bruisers got more popular because RIOT did a fine job systematically nerfing assassins into the ground (thank you for that btw) and AD tank fizz found its place in the RIft.\n\nADC's being noting more than glorified turret pushers, playing more utility based mid laners and junglers all drooling over runeglaive/devourer we are currently stuck in a tank meta with Jungle \"i have to hard carry syndrome\" with a few champions really being untouchable.\n\nAD tank fizz is one of them. WIth the standard 3 core of Trinity Force, Blade of the Ruined King and Frozen Heart he is the ultimate duelist. It surprises me to that he isn't permanently banned.\n\nFizz when build as mentioned above practically destroys all the other tanks as soon as he has 1-2 core. With his absurd mobility and the ability to still 100-0 any squishy whilst not being at risk he's beyond strong and so called \"toxic af\" to play against.\n\nIt's one big frustration playing against AD tank fizz. WIth him being able to 1v1 almost any champion, percentage dmg on both the W and his core in BORK,  a long range engage tool with his ultimate that provides WAY to much crowd control and 2 gap close/escapes its just all a bit to much.\n\nThere is no balance at all when it comes to fizz, he has the best of all worlds when he builds \"tank\" and has very little to no counterplay or at least not like all the other champions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"M Schumacher","date":"2015-08-12T07:22:17.142+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RiotRepertoir,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=vQR8VbWG,comment-id=000000000001,timestamp=2015-08-12T06:23:23.345+0000)\n>\n> Gut reaction is that he probably does too much reliable damage even when building tanky, that and maybe his early game isn't proving to be very vulnerable, which I believe it historically has been (outside of like level 2 all-in cheese that he was notorious for).\n\nI believe it's bruiser fizz that is the biggest problem.\n\nHe does way too much damage while building Triforce and maybe one other damage item. Combine that with the fact he still itemizes 40% CDR and maxes E second makes for a pretty antifun time. At least AP Fizz can be stunlocked and bursted down because he has no defensive items (except Zhonya's).\n\nAlso notable is the fact he's nearly impossible to gank and still melts squishy champs.","replies":[{"poster":"Binxy Prime","date":"2015-08-12T08:25:28.214+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fizz is easy to gank if hes even or behind, just wait for him to e and gank him, you have 13 seconds or something at lower levels and 7-8 seconds for the rest of them.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Academy Kayn","date":"2015-08-12T07:09:47.681+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IMO, his little \"Reduced damage from AA's\" stops him from being as bullied out of lane from ranged champs as he should be. Being able to abuse him more in the laning phase might make it easier against him.\n\nEdit: Also the Leblanc problem comes in with Fizz. His TrollPole is near undodgable, without mental strats. The same thing was with Leblanc, that was it was too easy too hit/too hard to dodge. Maybe lowering the speed of the descent of his trollpole would allow people to actually avoid it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"NemeBro","date":"2015-08-11T03:59:57.712+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=0MGW4LRU5,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=vQR8VbWG,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2015-08-11T02:12:48.679+0000)\n>\n> Just the champ in general.

The strenght of Triforce users is usually depends on how fast they can get it and transform the item into an unstoppable snowballing. And Fizz has one of the strongest lvl 6 power spike in the entire game, what is maybe fine in mid, but on top is you want to farm avoid his ultimate is very hard. And this power spike often lead into an early triforce and a win. What i want to see is a lvl 6 nerf, maybe make thew modifier from 20% ro 10%/20%/30% and make to exclude aa, but compensate ap Fizz with a minor damage buff on his q. Incrasing the cd on his e will only unneceserally gut his current ap/cdr build, while don't solve the issue of bruiser Fizz. But before any change we need to wait how 5.16 and the item and juggernaut changes will play out.
