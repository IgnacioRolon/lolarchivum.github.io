I think the REAL problem is that the beam turrets for the base are way too weak, not the blasting ones. The beam ones take forever to dent a tank once laning hits...sometimes even with TWO beams on them at once. These things are supposed to hurt, and TWO of them literally means DOUBLE DAMAGE.

They feel really weak really quickly, and even when a team pushes a single lane heavily the inhibitor turrets don't feel spectacular. At the same time, just buffing them numerically would likely just stretch out games, which would be far worse overall. The bonus effects added during the Summoner's Rift overhaul also mostly either shrunk to really weak levels (e.g. tier 2 turrets and their personal shield) or just disappeared completely (e.g. beam turrets having a slow and damage reduction effect). Beyond that, I think there's also a serious issue with turrets discouraging melee champions from pushing as part of a team, due to how they end up being exposed, which just encourages top laners to splitpush even more when the rest of the team is grouping, and is likely one of the reasons why marksmen are such a fixture in every game (nobody else can push turrets with the same level of speed and consistency). On top of this, turrets don't feel particularly valuable, again because they quickly lose their threat, which is why items specifically designed to interact with them in some way (e.g. {{item:2053}}, {{item:3056}}, {{item:3512}}) aren't nearly as popular as they deserve to be.\n\nFarther down, I think Riot should attempt to do a few crazier experiments with turrets, minions and lanes in general. Black Market Brawlers was a great experiment in making minions more interesting, and while brawlers might be a bit too complicated in the long run, I think there's a lot of stuff that could be put in place via both minions and turrets to make lanes and their structures feel more powerful and interesting without jeopardizing the game's pace or clarity. One thing worth trying, for example, would be to have turrets spawn minions at their feet, rather than the nexus, which would eliminate proxy farming, and another potential experiment could be to give one type of turret an additional shot per enemy champion in range, which would discourage ganging up on lone champions under their tower. Perhaps some turrets could just not fire any shots at all, and instead have other effects that would influence laning and champion interaction.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PL55","date":"2015-08-13T23:53:55.990+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I felt really dirty when I tower dived as vi and took like four turret shots at level 6 and got out alive.

Could either make it shoot faster or just up the damage, might give riot another lever on towers.

Obviously they can tower dive then take it, but it might be better than now. \nAlso could be a buff that only applies when enemy champions are near which would reduce the frequency of people killing towers in one minion wave, while not causing overly crazy side effects to how minion waves push on their own.\nThey could also opt to make it a stacking buff based on how many enemy champions are near. \n\nFrom there I'd imagine it'd be a numbers game.\n\nI don't know if it or any of the ideas anyone's listed would fix it, but i definitely agree that towers frequently feel like they are under-powered or at times completely worthless.","replies":[]},{"poster":"rG Thundrag","date":"2015-08-15T02:31:43.951+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Another issue with turrets is that against AD laners you can build armor to help you dive/tank turret damage, however if you're against a magic damage oriented enemy you can't dive them by building MR generally.\n\nSo a split way to make armor stacking not so effective against turrets and to give MR increased value I would suggest turrets damage be split roughly 60/40 physical and magic damage.","replies":[]},{"poster":"exe3","date":"2015-08-15T01:09:56.292+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's by design. Meddler recently said that towers are weak intentionally because they fear that no one will be able to end games if towers are good. This is what's led to no one ever buying 'tower counters' like BoC, Portal and Ohmwrecker because there's no point wasting an item slot on an item that isn't needed to kill towers.\n\nThe real issue of course is that towers completely lack gameplay. They have simplistic AI that shoots a single bolt at enemies. They need be more threatening in a gameplay point of view like every 3rd shot does AoE damage or something (i'd do a proper brainstorm but too tired atm) and their targeting AI needs to be overhauled, far too often I get tower dived and after the whole ordeal (where i'm dead ofc) the tower is still shooting flipping minions. Tanks also shouldn't be able to just ignore towers (except ult'd Alistair, I would view that as his strategic niche) but they can because they do no damage.\n\nIf this was fixed up then towers would be powerful, but wouldn't that mean teams can't end games because people could stall under their tower? Well that would be the case if there were no options to play against towers, fortunately we *already* have 3 already mentioned items that would be ripe for use against these newly empowered turrets (with more possibilities i'm sure). Furthermore you could even add new items/summoner spells for DEFENDING your turret. Imagine Garrison on SR, it'd be great.\n\ntl;dr\n\nTowers are weak by design so teams can end games. Imo they should be reworked to be powerful/can't be ignored and useful in defense but have items and summoner's spells (some of which already exist) that can be used to help with or against sieges/tower dives.","replies":[]},{"poster":"A Prop Phone","date":"2015-08-15T01:09:15.877+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are a lot of options to try that could be cool.\n\nTurret firing rate increases by 25% per nearby enemy, on hit stacking damage reduction (that way the more Yi auto attacks the harder the turret is to kill), or dealing mixed damage.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bronze Rumble","date":"2015-08-15T00:08:38.127+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have to agree, tower diving this season is easy as shit and taking a turret shot is not punishing at all even at early lvls. that's why I always ask my jungler to help me dive all the time because I know I can get in and get out alive 95% of the time","replies":[]},{"poster":"junglerboy16","date":"2015-08-14T23:03:57.193+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not to mention the ~~laser~~ **tickle** turrets. their damage has always been so low it's laughable.
