Long story short, they&#039;re in the MMO business now. They&#039;re finding that players like to invest in the same games because it feels like they&#039;re building on their previous investment of time/money, which is part of leagues business model.\r\n\r\nIMO the most important part of leagues business model is its easily accessible. Anyone with a toaster can play. Although the game play is solid, it&#039;s a poor mans MOBA. The graphics are intentionally toned down so more people can connect and compete with each other. As more refurbished consoles hit the market will riot lose this selling point? I think yes. You can bet that PS, Xbox, Wii want their console in every home so they can profit off DLC and exclusive title sales.\r\n\r\nOnce league loses these selling point they&#039;ll basically be where Runescape is at. Outdated with a core of dedicated but slowly declining players that remember league in it&#039;s pinnacle.","replies":[]}
