They take the game way too seriously. Leagues way of handling these players is to ban them. There are two things wrong with that. 1) They&#039;re banning passionate players. 2) It&#039;s a lazy way of moderation.\n\nOf course this will fall on def ears, at least in riots case, just look at dynamic queue.\n\nLeague player base is in decline. Visible moderation is an attempt to blame the player base decline on toxicity. League is 6-7 years old in an industry with competition coming at all angles, the player decline is natural. The problem is the permabans exacerbate the decline** because it kills people interest in league as a sport!** League players are as passionate as any real life sports fan yet how many NFL fans are told by the NFL not to play football. Not to mention how demoralizing it is to new players to have to deal with their new accounts. Bad for business. \n\n&gt; There are other methods of punishment. The problem is when you punish people they tell you what you want to hear and you never ask for truly 100% honest feedback from them. How can you create a fair punishment system if it doesn&#039;t include honest feedback from everyone? You are lazily taking feedback from players that have no f-ing clue on the problems toxic players have.\n\nGood job on trying, really, but really really think about who you&#039;re banning. Fans. Hardcore, in your face fans.","replies":[{"poster":"Mod Curator","date":"2016-06-09T22:08:28.850+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":2,"body":"At first I thought your post was about Visible Moderation which is something that happens here on the Boards, but it seems what you're trying to discuss is how in-game player behavior is handled.

Arguments that the community should or should not have input based on other aspects of the game, like dynamic queue, don't necessarily hold true for the behavioral system.
