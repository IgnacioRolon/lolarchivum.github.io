You need to be logged in in order to see that ticket.  If you've lost access in order to do that, you can also send us an email to support@riotgames.com.  In the meantime, the current ticket was escalated to our account team and you should receive an email notification in case you can't access it through the ticketing support site.  We'll respond as soon as we can!","replies":[]}]}
