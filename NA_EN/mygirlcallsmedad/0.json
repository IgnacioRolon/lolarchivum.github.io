I do well and then about 20 minutes into the game my client disconnects. So I shut off my computer and log back in and sometimes I come back into the game in time to play and help my team but a few times, I haven&#039;t been able to come back and I&#039;m considered a leaver, then my account gets a 10-minute wait before each game. Is there a way that I can get this ban lifted or is there a way that I can prevent my internet or client from doing this. Please help i need to get back to stomping with graves.","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2016-06-08T23:58:50.219+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd recommend just playing ARAM or playing with a full group of friends.  Otherwise there is high likelihood of you being reported for it.  Even if it isn't your fault, you are playing in full awareness that there is a high likelihood of disconnecting and not reconnecting before the game ends.\nI don't mean this to be rude, but it is also unfair to your teammates to have to deal with someone who is disconnecting, potentially costing them the game.","replies":[{"poster":"MyGirlCallsMeDad","date":"2016-06-09T00:32:03.974+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I attached an ethernet cable to my computer, my connection is fine now, but now my league client is crashing.
