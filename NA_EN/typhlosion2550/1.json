I was in the middle of the game and it instantly retarted and took like 5-10 mins to finally get back up. And in that time the game ended and i got the ban. And when my computer restarted there never was a warning or anything. Is there anyway i can fix or get rid of it?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-25T21:35:55.524+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You'll never get a 5x 20min low-priority queue for a single disconnection. In fact, it takes a trend of disconnections before you end up with this exact penalty.
