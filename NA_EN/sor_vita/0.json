Because a VPN bypassed the issue, it means the issue lies between your network and our servers, likely along your ISPs routing. We can capture some data to see what's going on in your route if you run a traceroute log. First, grab a network tool called [WinMTR](http://winmtr.net/) then plug **104.160.131.1** into the host field before starting the trace. After 5 minutes has passed by, export the results as text and paste them in a reply to me.\n\nLet me know if you encounter issues taking those steps.","replies":[{"poster":"KÃ­ng B3","date":"2017-05-11T06:26:59.875+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am having the same problem.
