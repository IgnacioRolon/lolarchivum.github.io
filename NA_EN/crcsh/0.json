I got an S with lulu and a chest + a key fragment.\nI went ahead and opened it, and after I clicked open and non of my loot appeared on the screen, so I waited for a good 1 minute and decided to click out of the tab. Then when I clicked back on my loot there was nothing. My chest and key were gone, so I am not sure if I got anything and I hope I can get some clarification about this.\n\nThank you.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-10T23:53:10.416+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sometimes it can look like you didn't get anything from the chest when you get an icon from it.
