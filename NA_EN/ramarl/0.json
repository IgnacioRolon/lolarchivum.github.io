Can't cast my ult during it. Ridiculous. I know it's his ult but it almost feels like an abused situation when it leads to a 1-shot if it lands. I can't think of any other skills that when they land lead to no way of getting out? Even Amumu has an incredibly strong ult but it doesn't insta-kill you. Fiddlesticks as well. \n\n\nI am seeing a repeated number of Malphite's doing this in games now.

Not many people seem to realize how powerful his W is actually, I mean it can give around 300-400 Armor when his passive is up not to mention it turns his auto-attacks into AoE nukes.

Charges immediately. Just like Kai'Sa's ult. Nearly impossible to flash while a Malphite runs towards you with his team right next to him. And if a fight starts and he uses it, you're dead.\n\nEven Fiddle has a charge up before getting to use his.

The fact that you don't is you not understanding the game.\n\nHow about you try going back to the days when Yi had a 100% AP ratio on Alpha Strike and a 300% AP ratio on the heal on his W with it still giving him high enough damage reduction to be nearly invulnerable. Seasons 1-3, this version of Yi, the AP Yi, completely stomped everyone from bronze 5 to plat 1 (what was then the highest rating in the game). It had no counterplay other than the usual Yi counterplay of stunning him for 10,000,000 years and praying you can kill him before he gets off Meditate. He was so broken that you'd be reported for trolling if you didn't get at least 5 pentas in a game with him (unless the enemy team ff'd at 20). If he wasn't banned, he was the only viable pick in the entire game.\n\nOr how about beta Yi, who had Highlander on his Q with all the same effects as current Highlander, but on a 20 second cooldown, passive was a chance on every auto to hit twice, W was just Meditate but useless, E was a toggle that made his autos deal bonus true damage and cost mana, and R was Alpha Strike, but it hit 10 people and had a 300% AD ratio.\n\nHow about old Eve, who had a targeted 3 second stun every time she came out of her minute-long stealth?\n\nBeta TF, who had gold card as an AoE, passive to give all allies globally some free crit chance, and his E was a global version of the teleport from his ult with a 30 second cooldown, ult was the same as it is, but with a slow attached that also made his E teleport instant.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MrFawknSunshine","date":"2018-09-20T03:11:08.446+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"fiddles isnt a skill shot its aoe .","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"KlydeFrog","date":"2018-09-20T03:12:53.298+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Yay more complaining and crying for netfs.

Play Xayah, keep an eye on him, and ult immediately when you see him start dashing at you. Or flash to the side. Or dash away. Literally anything. It targets a small circle and knocks up everything in that area.\n\nLooking at your op.gg, you seem to be a Kai'Sa player who rushes attack speed instead of getting Stormrazor first, causing you to deal no damage in the early game. You also start Doran's Shield, even though that's a really bad item to start on an ADC unless you're terrified to death of your lane opponent repeat killing you, which you never should be if you're on your main champion and know what you're doing.\n\nHere's a thing you can do: mark Malphite with your passive, and then when he ults, ult ANYWHERE in his range and I guarantee you his targeting will push him past your repositioning from your ult and he'll miss. It has a small range, only hits the circle and not the path along it, and it's literally his entire champion. If he's building full AP and you're dying to him, which would explain the 1-shot, I really don't feel sorry for you considering that you play one of the single best ADC's in the game at countering him and still fail to. You clearly don't understand the game at all.","replies":[]}]}
