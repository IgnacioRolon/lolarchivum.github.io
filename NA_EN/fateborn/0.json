For those of you new here, this concept is archived in the old forum thus the age. And the old geezers that lived back in that day may or may not remember this. I feels old already and I don&#039;t like this nostalgic feeling.\n\n(For those curious, simply google, &quot;League of Legends Ubelengel Aqua&quot;, it&#039;ll be the first two result. I remade her another time after the first, first link is the oldest, 2nd one was my previous. You are more than welcome to find my old concepts, but it&#039;ll be somewhat long search because of the sheer amounts that I created. You may notice a couple champion concepts were created a month or two before an identical champion with similar kit were created, same mind thinks alike. Sadly, because their champion concepts are more than elderly than whatever I created, it&#039;s safe to say their is the first in the little race I had going on. Also, additional fact! My 2nd Aqua kit, her E is far older than Lucian&#039;s W, so I take pride in that I created the first star pattern AOE. Yippie for me I guess?)\n\nBack to topic.\n\n**Abilities**\n\nPassive:\n_Essence of Hydra_\n\nAzure is invulnerable to attacks. Her health cannot be reduced as it simply does not exist. In its place is a being, Hydra, she begins with four hydras acting as her substitute health bar. Although she begins with 4, she eventually create an additional hydra every 6 levels, up to the maximum of 7. Their health system is unique to consider it a separate subject from the default health bar, where each Hydra only receive 30% of the Health and 20% of Armor and Magic Resist from items as benefit. (Runes and Masteries ignores this entirely.) Should every Hydra die, Azure will also die. If a hydra is killed, as long as the other Hydras does not take damages in 30 seconds, a new Hydra is recreated with same value of health it had before. Their respawn rate is reduced with health regeneration percentage converted by 10%. (More health regen = shorter time require to make a new hydra) Although Azure is invulnerable, she is entirely targetable to attacks with Hydra taking division of the damages to everyone (Target Azure = all Hydra takes shared division of the damages that would otherwise be dealt to Azure.) Targeting an individual Hydra will deal the full damage calculation. ( Damage not shared across Hydra if an hydra is targeted.) In the situation that all Hydra would otherwise be targeted, the damage is instead reduced dramatically based on how many Hydras were hit.\nIn the rare situation such as Brand&#039;s Ultimate, the Hydra will only send them to nearby minions/champions/monsters, and back if Azure or her pet Hydra is present at the location.\nEach Hydra deals 25% of Azure&#039;s total AD\nHydra&#039;s attack range is 200 relevant to Azure&#039;s hit box.\nAll Hydras are positioned in a circle around Azure touching the edge of her hit box.\n\nEach hydra has their own attack timer and acts independently if attack-move command is input.\nIf Azure selects a target to attack as normal, all Hydra will at their best effort targets that one, if an hydra is sadly out of the range, it will instead targets a random enemy unit nearby.\n\nStray Hydra may be picked up passively if Azure walks over them.\n\nNote- If this does not feels like Hydra is their own representative, I will remove the Brand ulti interaction and AOE interaction will be enabled and significantly nerfs the damage taken via AOE to avoid easy one AOE kill on hydras.\nThe hydras are living water created to appears as Hydra, they carry core that breath life into them, this core is what sustain their energy and the way Azure protects herself. \n\nQ:\n_Serpentine Strike_\n\nAzure springs a Hydra toward target location snaring the first enemy champion for the duration and the remaining Hydras strike outside the skillshot in an area and damages the captured champion and enemy units inside the area. After this instance, the Hydra used as an ammo will persist at the location attacking nearby enemy units until Azure calls it back or reforms on Azure after 7 seconds.\n\nHydras left behind by Aqua Needle will also strike toward the location.\n\nW:\n_Purity of Water_\n\nAll Hydra passively steals health upon attacking enemy champions. The health each steals are healfixed to their own individual health bar.\n\nAzure may activate this to immediately dispel all negative effects on all Hydras dealing a percentage of the damage each took within last 2 seconds in an area around themselves and calls strays back to Azure.\nEach layering damage are reduced by 70%.\n(Works like Cleanse, but does not reduce duration for later CC instead dealing damages)\nPassive part is disabled until ability cool off.\n\nE:\n_Aqua Needle_\n\nAzure create time delayed hydrogen explosion using Hydras at a target direction. The explosion contacts the half amount of Hydra available (2,3,3,4,4) The explosion are positioned from the nearest direction toward Azure and outward touching each explosion. (ooooA for example with o being explosion and A being Azure) the closest explode after a delay and the at the location and the next closest follows immediately as the next follows after and so on with each hydra immobile but behavior the same as default at their location. \n\nHydra left behind via Serpentine Strike will also explode for a slight larger area.\n\nR:\n_Blue World_\n\nAzure create an arena where her Hydra can prevails in combat, increasing their attack range to 350, and dramatically reduce Azure&#039;s ability cool down while within the domain.\n\n\n\n*Appearance*\nhttp://i.imgur.com/DVmMUyz.png\nThe artwork belongs to Tales of Symphonia Dawn of the New World, please be aware this is intended to be a visual possibility, and not always what is desired.\nIt is the closest so far to what I have in mind for her.\n\n\n**Lore**\n\nAs a member of a water dwelling race, Marai, Azure always live as an outcast due to her particular strange fondness for the surface, having collected large amount of strange trinkets that drifted down. From time to time, she would travels to the water's surface and scourge for drifting objects, when she came close to the beach, she meet a human wearing a strange stone imbuing with power of water hanging on a string beaded around his neck. Having learned of this average looking individual's name, she came to the beach to meet him and learn of the surface straight from his mouth. As time went by with the typical days, Azure would grow to fall in love with this human, Rainy. Time from time turned to daily, and relationship turned serious, Rainy proposed, vowed that he would uphold the tradition as his predecessor once did less than a hundred years prior with her at his side. Needless the answer was a yes, and they promised to meet again the next day to finalize their love before the day of hundredth year.\nWith a spunk she swam down to her town to prepare for her soon to be family days. As much as she can help it, everyone else in the village would know something was off due to her unnatural joy despite being somewhat oppressed by others. The seer that would otherwise finds the chosen Marai to be a Tidecaller met up with Azure when rumors went around. Warning her to not do anything that would upset the hundred years tradition and as soon as she came, she left. Unsettled by the warning, but it would not pause her joy, the life of experiencing surface would not compare to what loyalty she has toward this village.\nAs the dawn broke through the water, she threw on the nicest glamour befitting herself with trinkets of the surface here and there. As soon as she broke the surface and swam toward the beach to await for her future husband. What was visible from the water was not what she had expected. Rainy laid bloodied and tainted with black bruises bearing similarity to tentacles, his lower half is missing, and in his right hand held an azure embedded ring matching her name and hair color. Crawling toward the body, she heavily breathe, liquid flowing down, both sea waters and tears. Laying her head on the bared face of her future, even the loudest cannon fire would not suppress her sorrow. She knew what had killed him, and she knew why. The curse of Marai, the tainting monster that lurks beneath the underwater temple, the monster that devours flesh and spirit. Before the day of exchanging the moonstone and the abyssal pearl, this had happened, the boy who would hold the other side of exchange is dead, with this exchanging was no longer possible with tradition, and thus she untied the necklace, placed it on her bosom, the skin wraps around it and absorb it intact into her body, and the washing tide flood the beach around her forming bodies unheard of before. Understanding this change in herself, she permitted herself to permanently erase the enforced tradition once and for all. Carrying off her dead lover to bury him at the sea, she swears in her heart she will never allow anything like traditions to decide things.\n\n\nFriends: {{champion:131}}{{champion:103}} \n\nRivals: {{champion:267}}{{champion:105}}{{champion:111}}{{champion:420}}{{champion:84}}{{champion:98}}{{champion:85}}{{champion:238}}{{champion:114}}{{champion:86}}{{champion:59}}{{champion:43}} \n\nAny question, any concerns, feel free to post them in comments and I will do my best to answer them.\n","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Scruffy","date":"2016-03-05T07:02:40.772+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"Very interesting concept. The passive especially is gold. A starting point so bold as the multi unit leads to some interesting designs. \n\nOne thing that could combo well with that type of multi unit character is a skill that allows for some positional play with each or one of the hydras. Something like \"gain movement speed and leave one of your hydras behind (at current location) for 20s.\" That would allow for some clever plays where you leave a hydra behind to lower your damage but give you an escape.","replies":[{"poster":"Fateborn","date":"2016-03-05T18:38:23.468+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can this be real? a Riot staff commenting on my concept?\nMy dream has come true.\nAt long last!\n\nJoy aside, you brings up a good point on multi-unit theme.\nI actually discussed more with another member who occasionally work on Champions name withdrawing.\nHe brought up that I should reduce the amount of Unit controls to be less complicated and keep it at 3-4 at all time (That would had been my fix.)
