The utility and strength of evolved W is too reliable in combination with Kha'Zix's base kit, so he can get the best of all worlds by maximizing his utility while also being a high-threat assassin. Or b.) Kha'Zix's evolved Q is too weak to properly use as a primary play pattern, so he's forced to max / evolve W to stay relevant in the game but doesn't really want to. We strongly suspect the first case is more true (and this is reflected in our change).\n\nPlayers are maxing and evolving Kha's W first because after the loss of the evolved Q execute damage, he needs his W to stay relevant pre-11.  In 4.9 when his Q got a hard nerf and his W got a utility buff is it really so surprising that players adapted to that style?  Additionally in 4.9 with the removal of his damage reduction while stealthed, there became little reason to evolve R; the additional stealth is nice but his primary engagement/disengagement tool is his E, in most cases his R is used for jukes and buying time for his significantly more effective repositioning skill to come off cooldown.  I do not deny his W is very strong but it's much less the \"best of both worlds\" proposed above and much more of him needing it early because of the significantly reduced damage and the lack of an actual assassination/execute on his evolved Q.\n\nAs for Yasuo, I fully agree he is an incredibly powerful character and does need some balancing, but after losing the bonus flow generated by E I feel it it out of theme with his character and while it does not appear \"that bad\" I feel reducing his speed has a high level of  punishment for a character that is designed to be mobile on top of his heavy base health reduction, reducing his base health by nearly 10% and lowering his move speed which is primary defense early game seems ever so slightly TOO harsh.","replies":[{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2014-10-08T22:37:37.979+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kha'zix is just unloved by riot it seems. They gut his q, so people use his w. Now, they gut his w, and passively say \"Well we know you guys used it because his q kinda sucks early, BUT, we dont really want to admit it so huheuheuheuehehue utility OP\"\n\nAs far as Yasuo goes, that champ has waaaaaaaaaaaay too much. To much going for him for me to list. Something needed to go, and it looks like they decided he should keep his full kit at the exchange of Base HP and Movement Speed. I think he'll be fine, and just maybe balanced for once.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Xenth4","date":"2014-10-08T22:50:41.666+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This, exactly this for Kha Zix (I don't play Yas often)...if anyone from riot is reading right now. I used to main Kha mid lane earlier in the season, before everyone found him to be OP, and watched him get change after change to the point where he is now. It's defiantly not a \"best of both worlds\" that people go for void spikes, it's simply because getting an isolated Q off is almost impossible now, especially in lane due to the isolation nerf. Also a non isolated q is very lacking in damage to even consider trading with an enemy laner. He is strong in the jungle, due to the fact that when you gank there is that opportunity between turret and wave where you can take full advantage of the stronger isolated Q.","replies":[{"poster":"MarquiseMindfang","date":"2014-10-09T00:18:50.622+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I completely agree, Lane'Zix is nigh unseen now, his isolate damage is what let him be a threat in lane and he's too mana hungry to use W in lane to sustain without the Spirit Stone jungle minion mana vamp (unless you build Tear, but let's be honest where is there room for that in his build?)","replies":[{"poster":"Xenth4","date":"2014-10-10T01:29:59.586+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Exactly, tear was only viable with release Kha because his W was all of his damage and he needed the regen/manamune.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"SIayton","date":"2014-10-08T23:37:27.419+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree that the Yasuo nerfs were a bit extreme. He already has a pretty weak early game, especially with jungler pressure / against people that know the matchup. Its very rare I see a Yasuo win lane without consistent jungle assistance and that rarely happens because his kit naturally pushes the wave if you're harassing by E-ing off minions. \n\nAlso Riven was unbeatable with Yasuo pre-nerfs. After this... I don't think its possible to do anything in that matchup other than cower behind your tower and pray for ganks. I honestly feel like he's a bit on the weak side and people just see OMG DOUBLE CRIT and don't think about his vulnerabilities as a character (squishy melee with weak early game that dies to CC / focus). He doesn't have invuln like Yi or Fiora but he still has to get into the brunt of the fight, so if he doesn't have a good knock up to ult off of, he's essentially useless because he's just going to die the moment he enters the fight. \n\nI fully expect him to get buffed after his winrate plummets from these nerfs (which is already really low to begin with before the nerfs).","replies":[{"poster":"MarquiseMindfang","date":"2014-10-09T00:16:07.161+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't expect his rates to plummet, suffer a bit perhaps but he is still strong; it's not the lane CONTROL I'm worried about.  I wouldn't say his early game is weak by any stretch, dangerous yes but the same can be said for any assassin.  He does have a bit of a 'build around me' feel with the need to either personally hit at minimum 2-man knockups in teamfights without assistance (my personal favorite teammates with him are Wukong and Maokai).  I personally feel the way to compensate is instead of shaving off movement speed I think he should be docked a few points of base armor early instead, perhaps even mitigating the health nerf to closer to 5%-7% instead of 10%.  It makes him easier to kill but preserves his feel, especially with the fast, lightly armored samurai theme.","replies":[]}]}]}
