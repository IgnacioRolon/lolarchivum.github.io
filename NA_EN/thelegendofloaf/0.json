Since two days ago, right after a string of games that worked perfectly, this would happen for any game I tried to start. I've reinstalled twice, once after straight-up deleting the folder. I try to play custom games now to test and the same problem continually occurs.\r\nI have checked and there is aboslutely nothing wrong with my internet connection. I've both tried making exceptions for my firewall and turning it off, neither of which have worked. This 'disconnect' is not a connection issue.\r\nIs there any known way to fix this? I'll repeat, reinstalling  and firewall tweaks have NOT worked.","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-05-12T00:21:27.424+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"When you enter the Loading Screen, you are attempting to connect direct to the individual game server, not simply to the internet.  This is why you can encounter connection issues during the Loading Screen, but can load Youtube perfectly fine.  What we need to investigate is what is blocking you from connecting to the individual game server.  To that end, make sure to complete all of the steps found in our [Connection Issues Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664).  The steps there are the most common solutions that should resolve this issue and get you back into the game.\n\nFeel free to reply back and let me know if the issue is still there!","replies":[{"poster":"BetweenSkill","date":"2016-05-12T00:30:47.960+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That exact same issue happens to me.

In the meantime I've found out that running League as an administrator eliminates this issue. I've tested that the problem does indeed persist when I run it normally though. What could this indicate?","replies":[{"poster":"EnderForHegemon","date":"2016-05-12T02:28:29.708+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not an expert, but that suggests to me that your firewall or security programs haven't granted League access to connect your computer to Riot's servers. Running it as an admin overrides these safeguards and authorizes your computer to connect to Riot's servers.","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-05-12T22:37:28.420+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a pretty solid answer.  Running a program as Admin does over-ride a lot of other security settings, which may otherwise block League of Legends.\n\nGlad to hear that you were able to get it working however! :)","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"l    Kirito    l","date":"2016-05-12T16:07:41.514+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Running into a similar problem =P","replies":[]},{"poster":"Existencexx","date":"2016-05-11T21:56:33.674+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ive had the same issue and when i do get in game i have packet lose this is BS riot support hasnt helped me at all told me that it was my ISP and my isp tested every little thing on my end and said it was fine.","replies":[]}]}
