I have to completely restart my computer with a hard reset to get back into the game. My windows Game Bar is off. I've sent in multiple tickets and can't seem to get the issue resolved. Help please.

I saw that you had a little bit of a back and forth with one of our tech agents, but it didn't go too far before the ticket was solved from there not being a response. Go ahead and reply to that ticket, or just send another over to those tech agents as this might need a little more in-depth troubleshooting than I can do from the boards.","replies":[]}]}
