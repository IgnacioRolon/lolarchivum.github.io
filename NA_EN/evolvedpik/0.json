I will be in violation of the summoner code so let's explain the fundamentals here.\n\nThe survey is somewhat awkwardly worded by it pertains to player satisfaction with the length of the match specified. To this end, the question asks if the length was something the player agrees with or not and to what degree they agree with said duration. It's really not that complicated..... the poll was just somewhat awkwardly worded.\n\nI would think native english speakers would have a much easier time than I do, given that english isn't even my native language [That line came dangerously close to , this isn't even my final form].","replies":[{"poster":"Sraeg2013","date":"2017-08-07T20:13:19.510+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not \"awkwardly worded\", it's flat out incorrect if the idea behind this specific poll is what you say it is.\n\nThe poll asks for an opinion about a statement that can only be \"true\" or \"false\", because you literally have the length of the match written on the same screen.\n\nSomebody joked that it's an IQ test which may ironically be closer to the truth.","replies":[{"poster":"Dominick Destine","date":"2017-08-07T21:57:58.069+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Sraeg2013","date":"2017-08-07T22:11:39.271+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">I am forbidden from ripping into your arguments [as I would love to do since they're atrocious] \n\nOh, please do.\nMaybe then your counter-arguments would start making sense beyond \"I'm not allowed to say\".\n\n>Sometimes I wonder how people can be so.......\n\nI wonder that too.\n\n_\"Rate your agreement:\nThe match I just played was longer than 30 minutes.\"_\n\nThere is nothing to agree on.\nIt's not a matter of opinion.\nIt either was longer than 30 minutes or not.\nNo \"maybeh\".
