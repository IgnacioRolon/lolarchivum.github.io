{"poster":"Mirranda","date":"2015-01-30T21:01:32.021+0000","title":"A Letter to Riot - Katarina","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"Dear Riot,\r\n\r\nLet me preface this letter (incoming wall of text) by saying that I am not an expert on your game, nor do I claim to be. I rank mid gold every season so I'm not a professional player. I am however a player who since this game went into beta and Katarina was made available have loved the champion and have played her through highs and lows all the same. I have roughly 1000+ games as her and would like to have another 1000+ in the future.\r\n\r\nWith that said, let me address my concerns. A few weeks ago a tweet went out with \"tentative\" balance changes for Katarina. Since then there was a massive feedback freakout by the community including prominent Katarina players (TiensiNoAkuma included). Since then another tweet came out saying they were scrapping that approach to her. As a lover of Katarina I am thoroughly thankful for this.\r\n\r\nBut the events of the past couple weeks have brought to center stage the problem that is balancing Katarina. She is one of (if not the most) snowballing champions in the game. As such she lends very strongly to \"pub stomping\" at low ranking games (due to player skill (or lack of), reaction times, game knowledge, etc.) however, as you get higher rankings she becomes exponentially harder to play at a competitive level. I can think of less than 5 players that are Master/Challenger rank that consistently play Katarina and do well with her. Having watched them any time I see them in a featured game to spectate or stream, there is a number of things that you can do at a lower level of play that you would never do at a higher level of play due to the same reasons listed earlier.\r\n\r\nSo how do you balance her without changing the feel of this amazingly entertaining champion? Her core power comes from her passive. The ability to reset cooldowns is not unique to her, but having it reset ALL of her basic abilites AND affect her ultimate is. This gives her great risk/reward chances, punishing you if you go in too early but giving you amazing rewards if you go in at the right time. Right now her power is very ultimate centric. If your ultimate is up you can do some serious damage. If it's not, you feel near worthless. With the removal of the DFG this feeling is exacerbated. In a more recent change, the cooldown on her rank 1 ultimate was significantly increased to reduce her early game ability to roam and making you choose much more carefully when to use your ultimate. Are you going to roam? Better not use it to harass your lane opponent out of lane before you go.\r\n\r\nOne of the thoughts that came through my mind when I was trying to understand why the tentative changes (and that approach to balancing her) was being considered was this: Why is she so powerful at low levels and not at higher levels? I feel a lot of it is still centered around her ultimate. At lower levels of play people do not have the reaction time or mechanical skill to really react to or the game knowledge to predict when Katarina is going to ultimate. As such she becomes a one-button-win champion where you literally spin-to-win and snowball out of control. At higher levels this is less prominent and individual player farm (and thus gold income) is also much higher so getting \"fed out of your mind\" is much less prominent.\r\n\r\nMy idea for a possible solution to this would be to make her base abilities more reliable as far as where your damage comes from and make her less ultimate reliant. By moving some of the base damage from her ultimate (mostly rank 2 and 3, rank one feels great) to her other abilities (possibly just her Q and W) while keeping (or slightly lowering) the scaling on her ultimate would give her more consistent damage and a more consistent threat from her rather than a \"Is her ultimate up? No? Ignore? Yes? Focus all attention on her!\" approach. While this can cause some cool team play, it's very one dimensional and not very interesting. By having her have a more consistent threat even if her ultimate is on cooldown she becomes more than an \"ult-bot\" that you just assume if she comes in that her ult is up and you need to be ready to interrupt it at all costs. With the power shift from her ultimate to her basic abilities though, she will again become a lane bully that scales amazingly into late game (though at high risk in late game fights). One of the balances that could be done to help with this is by changing her passive to only reduce the cooldown of her ultimate by (10sec, X%, not at all?) so that it falls more in line with other assassins as far as how long the cooldown on her ultimate is. You'll be rewarded for using a smart ultimate and not just spamming it and having it be \"literally always up.\"\r\n\r\nI've noticed a trend in more recent seasons to a shift away from having a dynamic of strong early game champions that fall off to making every champion weak in early game and scale well into late game. And while this does help prevent games snowballing out of control into one team's favor, it also makes for a rather slow and monotonous early game. By changing her in a manor like I described above it would shift her back to an early game lane bully that excels in mid game and scales decently into late game but is really only effective near the end of the game if she makes smart plays, but with threat that comes from more than a single ability. Obviously I'm not providing numbers or doing math to give you exact numbers of how to balance her, but this would keep her plalystyle and feel that so many people love the same but would allow for a more even curve of her dominance of lower level games to her significant decline at higher levels. (I feel a few assassins could benefit from this style of change, giving them a stronger early game but a stronger fall off late game).\r\n\r\nThank you for taking the time to read this letter and I hope that this gives some inspiration to someone to keep her play style as it is but just adjust where some of her power comes from.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nA Katarina Player and League of Legends fan\r\n\r\nTL;DR: Shift power from her ultimate to her basic abilities, make her passive have less (or no) effect on her ultimate. Gives her a flatter power curve and should allow her to have some presence at higher level play while making her less of a one-button \"no skill\" champion at low level play.","replies":[{"poster":"Captain Aishi","date":"2015-01-31T00:11:05.852+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"well structured post, but to the point: never gonna happen\n\nsince her rework, katarina has had multiple damage nerfs to her Q, W and E, always to put more power into her ultimate, for the simple reason that it's the only skill she has that has counterplay (you can move out of range or CC her to stop it) \n(you could argue that there is some level of interaction with her Q in lane, but let's be honest it's minimal at most)\nthey kept saying in patch notes that they wanted katarina to be successful based on how well you could manage to use your ultimate in fights (and i think she's perfectly balanced and still great fun to play that way)\n\nalthough if what you say is true that they scrapped the tentative changes, I'm also relieved to hear it","replies":[{"poster":"Mirranda","date":"2015-01-31T00:29:34.765+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Captain Aishi,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=KZfAzGcu,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-01-31T00:11:05.852+0000)\n>\n> well structured post, but to the point: never gonna happen\n> \n> since her rework, katarina has had multiple damage nerfs to her Q, W and E, always to put more power into her ultimate, for the simple reason that it's the only skill she has that has counterplay (you can move out of range or CC her to stop it) \n> (you could argue that there is some level of interaction with her Q in lane, but let's be honest it's minimal at most)\n> they kept saying in patch notes that they wanted katarina to be successful based on how well you could manage to use your ultimate in fights (and i think she's perfectly balanced and still great fun to play that way)\n> \n> although if what you say is true that they scrapped the tentative changes, I'm also relieved to hear it\n\nI agree with you totally with this. I think she's at a great place right now, even with the removal of the DFG. But the approach they were trying to take would have ruined her and this was my personal point of view on it. I feel if they need to make a change to her that it should be to numbers and where her power spikes come from rather than her actual style of play.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Decaedeus","date":"2015-01-31T00:39:59.310+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the main issue with Katarina is that once she gets ahead, her weaknesses don't really exist anymore. When you can literally QEWR and they die in the first three daggers of Death Lotus, they really don't have an opportunity to CC you before they're already dead. A fed Katarina can chunk 70% of your health with a single QEW combo; no, damage shouldn't be frontloaded further onto her kit. I also disagree with your point that Katarina is early-game, or even an assassin; to me, Katarina is a teamfight, AoE focused champion.","replies":[{"poster":"Mirranda","date":"2015-01-31T02:34:46.087+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Currently she is not an early game champion. She was before her rework a few years ago. You could literally chunk people with just your dagger with no items. All of her scaling though during that time was on her ultimate and she had no consistent damage. You had to get a reset to keep going or you were totally useless (more than now). You also had no potential to kill without your ultimate. Now she at least scales to the point that her basic abilities can kill an ADC with about 500 AP (depending on what they have built and how early in the game you get it).\n\nShe can be a team fight, AoE centered champion, but she's also an amazing assassin and is generally approached as such. Most successful Katarina's don't engage team fights, they skirt the edge looking for an opportune time to go in and get that first reset. That to me is the definition of an assassin.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2015-01-31T00:36:29.094+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Not gonna lie, I did not read the whole thing, but a good kat who has a team built around her is unbelievably broken.\n\nYou cannot do anything if she gets fed, and her team is designed around cc'ing you and keeping her alive.\n\nLiterally impossible.\n\nI have seen it in high elo, and it destroy's.\n\nIn the words of Pobelter \"Absolutely Disgusting\" \n\nShe needs a rework. She is a very very very toxic champion, and is horribly antifun to play against. I am talking old Vlad and Mordekaiser levels of antifun.\n\nDifference between Katarina and other assassins? They kill one target. Katarina kills your entire team.\n\nNow I dont want her to be gutted, she needs to remain viable, nerfing her into unviability and leaving her to rot is stupid.\n\nBut she needs something done, else she will just simply get gutted and left to rot. The tenative changes would be fine, IF a few more things were changed.\n\nAlso, they did not say it was scrapped, they said they were still testing with it.\n\nShe has little to no counterplay other than \"Just cc her\", which you cant do if YOU are cc'd by her teamates.\n\nHave you seen Voyboy play her? Good god. That's high elo, dont even get me started on the pub stomping.\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"Mirranda","date":"2015-01-31T02:30:49.131+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Some of what you mention I did talk about further in my post. I have indeed seen Voyboy play Katarina. A lot of what I was talking about was tweaking her so her power was shifted from being focused on her ult and taking some of the overall scaling she has away for a bit of base damage for better laning and making her ultimate less (or not) affected by her passive meaning her choice of when to ult would be more impactful.\n\nI did actually get scrapped though.\nhttps://twitter.com/ricklessabandon/status/560200757975085056","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"theBISnyx","date":"2015-01-30T22:11:16.256+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1) What was the Katarina rework anyway?\n2) Why nerf Katarina?

I feel she's in a fairly good spot right now but since she's apparently the target of Riot's balance team, I'm hoping that this message will get to them and that they'll keep her game play as is and just tweak some numbers around. The changes they were thinking about making would make her feel 1) broken (from a play style stand point) and 2) like a totally different champion (with similar mechanics) with a mixed philosophy on what they wanted to do with the champion.\n\nThere's a post on Reddit by TiensiNoAkuma discussing in depth what those changes would have done to her and they all make a lot of sense.","replies":[]},{"poster":"1st HanarSpectre","date":"2015-01-30T23:28:32.931+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=theBISnyx,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=KZfAzGcu,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-01-30T22:11:16.256+0000)\n>\n> 1) What was the Katarina rework anyway?\n> 2) Why nerf Katarina?
