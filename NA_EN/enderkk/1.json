Not sure if these events are connected but stating it anyway. I opened my browser and the internet was working fine but my client still said \"Trying to Reconnect\" so I clicked \"Exit instead\" and attempted to log back in. Well that's when things got bad. I typed in my username and password and pressed Enter as usual but the client got stuck on \"Authenticating\" After about a minute it stopped and said \"Something went wrong\" It gave the link to the Riot Support page. I clicked this link but for some reason the support page wouldn`t open up. I typed in the support page through Google and it also wouldn`t open up. Pretty much everything on the League of Legends website worked EXCEPT the support page. Only way I'm typing this now is because I`m using a separate computer. Anyhow, I pressed the \"Full repair\" button under the little settings button on the log on screen hoping that would fix things, but it didn`t, the full repair went through its course but it changed nothing, I still couldn`t log in. I can log in on the computer I'm using currently but this computer is a labtop and quite slow, not made for League of Legends gaming. I`ve tried restarting my computer and I might reinstall League of Legends on that computer. I don`t know. Please help!\n\n{{sticker:cass-cry}}\n\n\n\nUPDATE: Game working now, no idea why or how. Rito why you do dis lol. If someone helped thank you, if not... wat wat wat wat wat gg report team","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-03T01:32:16.457+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nothing was done on our end! Sounds like you were most likely just having some random internet issues, which isn't exactly uncommon.","replies":[{"poster":"Enderkk","date":"2017-10-03T01:41:01.507+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wasn`t internet connection if that's what you mean. I could browse the internet fine, maybe connection with Riot servers or something. I dunno. Glad everything seems okay for now. \n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-03T02:10:24.372+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just because you can still access stuff like youtube or netflix doesn't mean you will have a clear connection to game servers. Each server is independent and it's relatively common to have different pings depending on who you're contacting. Next time this happens, feel free to do some basic troubleshooting on the network, or simply wait it out until your ISP straightens things out ^-^!","replies":[{"poster":"Enderkk","date":"2017-10-03T02:23:10.543+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay!
