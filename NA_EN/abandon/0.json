{"poster":"Abandon","date":"2016-10-27T12:36:19.265+0000","title":"Season 6 Sucked Dicks for Melee","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":74,"down_votes":21,"body":"I&#039;m not lying when I say this past season sucked donkey dicks. \r\n\r\nSo many changes happened during this season that ruined the balance between Melee and Ranged.\r\nForget even attempting to fight a ranged champion as a melee nowadays, you&#039;re not allowed to farm, you&#039;re not allowed to try and all in because you get chunked well before that, you&#039;re not even allowed to hide under your turret. It&#039;s just a constant barrage of poke and getting chunked - go back home, either tp or walk back to lane, get chunked again but you have no tp now so you sit under turret and then get all in&#039;d. \r\n\r\nRanged champions across the board got buffed in season 6. Marksmen and Mage update really shifted the balance of early game power towards ranged. Before these changes, ADC&#039;s had significantly weaker stats compared to melees as a means of a clutch for their amazing late game potential with their ease of kiting, poking and dps. Mages on the otherhand, benefited extremely well with keystones and then on top of that, were given some pretty good itemisation options (protobelt specifically). Whilst all this was going on, Melees were left shafted. Only the truly &#039;op&#039; or abusive champions were allowed to be good and even then, they fell out of favour quickly as ranged became prominent picks up to keep them at bay. \r\n\r\nRanged champions have an inherent advantage over melee champions, but there just isn&#039;t adequate optimisation in either the keystone or item department that allows melee champions to alleviate this burden.\r\n\r\nWhat item do I bring when I have to lane against a quinn or jayce? Cloth 5? It really feels like I end up at Cloth 0 at 3 mins. Doran&#039;s shield? It doesn&#039;t even feel like I even came to lane with anything. What about when they are ap? There&#039;s nothing that helps me against the AP match up. It&#039;s just a feelsbad scenario across the board. Mid to Late game, sure if you&#039;re tank and you went full ARMOR then yes, maybe the adc light smacks aren&#039;t hurting you thoroughly but for anyone else it really is a matter of kill or be killed. There really isn&#039;t any good options for melees to idk, close the gap or take less damage for a brief second or something to allow them to do their job and kill the ranged champs before getting totally poked out.\r\n\r\nThen we come to the keystone section and the one thing i can say confidently is every damage option just works better on a ranged champion. There is no contest to this. Sure maybe that cheesy AD Xin top might hurt hard if he gets close and QQQ you down but at least you can trade back and are allowed to walk up and down your lane without taking obscene amounts of damage for free. Ranged champions on the other hand can land 3 auto&#039;s and proc thunderlord&#039;s or just sit back and stack fervor on you. You proceed to attempt to take your 3rd melee creep and get done in by another TD proc or get AA&#039;d to death by ferver users. You now have two options (barring jungle gank) - you sit back and cry as you lose a shit load of gold or you go back, recuperate your masochist energy to come back into lane as a lvl 1 or 2 vs a lvl 4 and proceed to have the same thing happen only worse. gg.\r\n\r\nNONE OF THESE DAMAGE MASTERIES MAKES IT ANY EASIER FOR MELEE CHAMPIONS TO GO UP AGAINST RANGED CHAMPIONS BUT GOING DEFENSIVE DOESN&#039;T SAVE YOU EITHER. \r\n\r\nLegit, where are masteries to make your minions bash up the enemy aggressor for picking on you or the masteries that allow you to absorb a bit more damage periodically or even the mastery that allows you to not get fucked in the ass by creep block when you&#039;re fleeing for your life for arrogantly thinking you could sneak off 1 cs. There&#039;s really nothing that is a good standard pick or situational keystone that allows melees to alleviate ranged bullshit.\r\n\r\nMay melee rest in pepperonis.\r\n \r\nP.S: FK REDSMITE RANGED JUNGLERS, THINKING THEY CAN GO MELEE FORM ON YO ASS CAUSE OF THAT DAMAGE REDUCTION AND DAMAGE, THE HELL.\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nTl;dr - Melee have no good masteries or items to alleviate burden of range disadvantage and ranged champions can abuse basically everything. pls gib proper funeral for melee.","replies":[{"poster":"1 800 Top Lane","date":"2016-10-27T13:54:14.345+0000","up_votes":27,"down_votes":1,"body":"The truth hurts.","replies":[{"poster":"EvilUnicornLord","date":"2016-10-27T16:42:32.035+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Name checks out.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ForgiveColour","date":"2016-10-27T15:05:19.244+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":22,"body":"Oh yeah lets pretend ranged top laners was dominating top lane before patch 6.2 Xd","replies":[{"poster":"Sona x Rubick","date":"2016-10-27T16:52:01.576+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":1,"body":"can you not be retarded once?\n\nlast world gnar had 100% win rate against any non melee champ\nseason 3 had elise+ryze+kennen+jayce dominating top lane\nseason 4 had almost the same thing just elise not being here but {{champion:117}} \n\nit's been ages that ranged top lane destroys the fun of balance except when melees are either so tanky like mundo/nasus season4, or bring so much damage like release juggernauts","replies":[{"poster":"ForgiveColour","date":"2016-10-27T17:15:13.554+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":25,"body":"LUL \n\nTanks have dominated top lane for almost the entire season 6 stop pretending that your cancer tanks are weak all season  \n\ndarius fiora maokai ekko poppy hecarim mundo shyvana renekton jax fizz ganeplank yasuo irelia trundle shen jarvan rumble nautilius pls tell me how they are never viable\n\nAlso your season 4 comment LUL.

Grasp of the Undying will be useful for melee vs. melee matchups and Courage of the Colossus will reward the colossus&#x27;s courage to engage.\n\ncourage of the colossus is dogshit for anyone who\n\na) doesnt have hard cc. meaning anything akin to a stun, snare, knockup, supress. it doesnt trigger on soft cc.\n\nb) doesnt have a reliable way to engage, since the shield measures the amount of enemies around you at the time youre ccing them. meaning even nautilus ulting from max range wont benefit from the shield.\n\njuggernauts usually have neither.\n\nCoC will be godlike on {{champion:54}} ult engages into the enemy team, especially in combination with legendary guardian and the new mastery that increases your defenses by 10% + 2/lvl bonus armor for 2 seconds. but it doesnt do anything for juggs.\n\n they have barely any synergy with the resolve tree at all. and those few masteries in that tree theyre synergizing with are usually complete garbage.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"MaeDoSan","date":"2016-10-27T13:02:06.895+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":21,"body":"You are experiencing withdrawal symptoms you have been high on the tank meta for far too long","replies":[{"poster":"Abandon","date":"2016-10-27T14:55:45.706+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":1,"body":"When tanks are strong and i mean STRONG (they can literally fite u 1v1) then obviously there's a problem.
