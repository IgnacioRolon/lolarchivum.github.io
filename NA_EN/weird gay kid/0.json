Saw a thread last week which had a guy complain about _how_ supports aren't allowed to take cs. And that, there is no rule stated by Riot where he shouldn't be allowed to take cs. Then he went on to rant about how ADCs rage at him for taking 1 cs by accident.  Now, if he's playing since S3, you'd imagine that he must have a full fledged main. Guy's main was the account he was posting on! He had been playing Soraka support with like 63+ cs, running {{item:3508}} and {{item:3052}} in Ranked. No trinket ward updated 30 mins. in. Btw, here's the icing to his story. He comes in to play like 5-6 games every year on that same account. Since S3. Heh, so you can't blame me for doubting if you were actually on your main or not. \n\nTo what you said, OP. My entire history is 3v3 bots because I only leveled this alt. account to 30 using TT. And, I don't know why you're bothered by me bringing your level up. I don't look down on you because of your level on an account in a game. I brought your level up because I had a feeling of understanding this situation in low level accounts. I had just played on my EUW low level and experienced the problem of people not listening. Even pinging, talking doesn't help. That's just how it is and that's why I said what I did. \n\nWhat's the point of putting it in there as a report though? If Riot started punishing people for being unskilled, anyone trying to climb up the ladder while experiencing a tough game would be punishable. That'd make things so much more difficult. And it'd hurt to try and learn while climbing the ladder rankings. That's one thing. Another thing, regarding \"_useless_\" players. I prefer calling them_ potatoes_ to be nice about it. I had a jungle who basically sat in the jungle as an Udyr, farming minions for the entire 30 minutes of the game. Had him once on my team and then on the enemy team. Where his team had a top lane smurf who basically went 1v9. And they had issues ending cause' this guy liked to PVE in ranked. My point is, this how league's always been. You get potatoes on your team, accept the loss and move on. If you get upset about it, you will just get bogged down by the players and the game. Complaining about this is pointless, if Riot could have fixed issues of players being unskilled in their division then they'd have done so long ago. They can't even oust botters, fix client problems or deal with PBE bug issues carrying over to live. To name a few! Toxic players, AFK'ers and inters are a long shot away. And unskilled ones are definitely out of the chart.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Vreivai","date":"2019-11-21T07:25:25.450+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm sure OP never would be reported under the \"unskilled player\" option if they got what they want here.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Harrowïng","date":"2019-11-21T07:06:02.102+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Reporting for unskilled makes as much sense as you telling your parents you failed school because your teacher hates you when in reality, you never did the work.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ﬂoo","date":"2019-11-22T16:12:13.609+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea that report will teach 'em!\n\nThey'll never play bad again under my watch, HA!","replies":[]}]}
