You could pick your champ and lane and not have to worry about the blind pick trolls. ( i.e ADC or feed) And it only took like 2 mins at max to find a group of people to create a team and play. BUT NOW it will literally take you 20 - 30 mins to just find one freaking support or even a jungle. WTF happened to team builder. This is insane having to wait so long just to play one game. I'm seriously about to quit using team builder and risk the troll waters of Blind pick, but I really don't wont too. Is Riot even aware of this issue and are they gonna do anything about it. I hate to see something that was great in the beginning fall apart because of neglect. I know i can't be the only person frustrated about this. Please raise your voice let it be heard so that Riot can do something about this before it becomes a black mark in an otherwise perfect game.","replies":[{"poster":"Mandaari","date":"2014-09-08T02:49:41.876+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"[Relevant](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/summoners-rift/MlNb2A21-team-builder-suggestion-let-people-who-fill-often-cut-in-line)\n\nIt's also not about Riot needing to do something.

It wouldn't be bad if the games didn't commonly run 45+ minutes...that's essentially an hour a match. If I get up a little early in the morning and have a spare 50-60 minutes before work, I want to get in, play, and get out. I have mained supp since I started a few months back, but I DO enjoy the other roles...sometimes it feels like punishment sitting in queue juggling 10-15 players while waiting for a supp :(\nIMHO, offer a little incentive if a role in queue is a severe minority - maybe a 10-20% IP bonus for queuing for that role for that match?
