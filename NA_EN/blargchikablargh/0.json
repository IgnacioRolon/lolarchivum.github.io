I just had to dodge a game because our jungler locked in Vlad at the last possible second and claimed he was going mid. Mind you, this was AFTER I already took mid and the only role left was ADC after him. Wtf are we supposed to do about stuff like this? I had to dodge with one second left because no one should have to suffer through ranked queue with a troll. Especially one like this. You really need to do something about the state of ranked champ select. Put in place a kick/ban/report system for pre-game please!! In-game reports are nice and all but you don't do anything for the affected players...AT ALL. I decided to come back after a hiatus to play a few games and this is what I get. COME ON!!","replies":[{"poster":"Stab","date":"2017-09-03T18:30:38.085+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"you made the right choice to dodge. 90 percent of the time you will lose when you have trolls like this vlad on your team.","replies":[{"poster":"BlargChikaBlargh","date":"2017-09-03T18:48:44.489+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"EXACTLY!!

So, I should keep losing my rank bc of this? What kind of solution is this!? This system DOES NOT WORK. Hell no am I sticking with a losing ranked match because of a troll. I don't play this game to get frustrated and waste my time and I doubt most of the other players do too. At least give us some kind of out in ranked for these types of situations. You guys give no way of controlling the champion select lobby and that's where a lot of the shit happens...","replies":[]},{"poster":"EROTIC RAID BOSS","date":"2017-09-04T04:02:19.191+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"are you kidding me i'd much rather dodge. you guys gotta  come up with a better way of handling situations like that, like a 'why I dodged' report situation. its worth it to lose 3 LP over 20, or even to just not lose 30 min of your life","replies":[]}]}]}
