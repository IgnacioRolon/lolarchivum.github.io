Is the option simply unavailable (stating that you need to fulfill the requirements) or does it give you an error message when you try to queue into a Ranked Gamed? Can your friends invite you to a party for a Ranked Game? If you're still having issues, hit up my colleagues via the Support Site here: \n\n- https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new \n\nFrom there, my colleagues can take a look at the account and see what might be causing you to be unable to queue into a Ranked Game.","replies":[]}]}
