This is not the first time this bug has surfaced. Hopefully this gets fixed soon.\n\nI have only played one game so far today with Caitlyn. Will see if the bug persists.","replies":[{"poster":"DingleNutsMcGee","date":"2015-10-07T01:10:40.105+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Happens to me when i play caitlyn quite often. Its part of the reason i stopped playing her for a while.

Just went into a custom and the bug is gone. I wonder if this has to do with a strange interaction with pix as lulu was the support last game and I think someone brought it up that Lulu was a bit glitch'y.","replies":[]}]}
