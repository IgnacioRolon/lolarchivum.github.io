It goes back and forth between good and bad, but its almost everpresent. I turned off Youtube and it still had lag so hard when i hit accept into a bot game, that when someone didnt accept i didnt know for a good minute or two because it was still trying to see if the 5th person would accept or not..... Anyone have some ideas as to what to try?\n\nIf someone is going to suggest rebooting computer and doing some scans, i do that normally, it helps but as a permanent solution I am trying to figure out some ideas to check...... apart from someone just saying \"get a new computer thats a gaming computer\" or whatever.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-03T22:32:07.870+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even if other pages load okay, you can still have issues reaching specifics servers like our game servers.
