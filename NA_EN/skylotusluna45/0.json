I've had to un-install and re-install the game at least 5 times after I log off my laptop. I don't know if it has to do with the fact that I am not playing on a PC or if Mac's are not too compatible with the game. I am re-installing it as I type this. \r\nLet me know what can be done, Thank you!\r\n&lt;3","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-06T01:25:19.270+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mac's can definitely run League, but what kind of problems are you having specifically?
