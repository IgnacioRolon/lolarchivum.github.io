The first thing I can see when I get there is the ban time. Can't prepick anymore. Sometimes I can't even join the champ select before the bans so for the system I'm a game leaver. Can't you make a lower quality champion select without all the flashy effects and sounds? Thank you in advance for your time.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-07-14T16:45:17.571+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This may not have to do with the quality, but the strength of your connection losing sync an leaving you behind in champion select.
