Being melee only obviously adds strategic value.\r\n\r\nBut once the Permafrost is applied, can ranged allies also stack it? \r\n\r\nSo say there&#039;s a bot lane of Ezreal and Nami. Obviously they can&#039;t start stacking Permafrost on their own. But once Sejuani gets into melee range and applies the first instance of Permafrost, will their basic attacks then contribute to the stacking? Or is it still melee only?","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2017-04-15T01:04:11.037+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":3,"body":"No, ranged allies can neither start Permafrost nor stack it. Sejuani's got a strong melee specific synergy, in part because we wanted to got for a heavy cavalry leading a tribe full of up close and personal warrior types feel.","replies":[{"poster":"LankPants","date":"2017-04-15T01:37:53.888+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":3,"body":"I feel like this will be far too restricting to the champ select process. It just seems like a pointless restriction which arbitrarily forces Sejuani to play in  melee heavy comps. Ultimately gameplay needs to come before thematics and this being melee only is heavily detrimental to gameplay, a player's champion shouldn't just be shit if their team doesn't pick for extreme synergy.","replies":[{"poster":"Meep Man","date":"2017-04-15T01:53:30.038+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Sejuani can apply it too, it's just synergy boosts it.","replies":[{"poster":"LankPants","date":"2017-04-15T01:55:55.396+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"From what I've seen though so much of Sejuani's power is tied up in the stuns that if you can't get multiple in a teamfight she's just a bad champion. She lost her AOE stun, she can no longer do what she used to in engaging, so if you try to pick her without melee synergy she'll be a useless champion even if she can stun one or two champs.","replies":[{"poster":"Psykoh","date":"2017-04-15T02:11:45.203+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":7,"body":"U haven't even played or seen her yet gtfo","replies":[{"poster":"LankPants","date":"2017-04-15T02:19:04.460+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"I can understand what the changes will do though. I've played more games of Sejuani than almost anyone else on these boards, I've played Sejuani for around 6 years now, since before her original rework. I understand how her kit works and I'm currently quite pessimistic about her outlook.\n\nShe's losing her engage, she doesn't have her large AOE stun anymore, which is a huge loss of power. In order to get that AOE back she effectively needs the support of melee champions. You can see what her W looks like if you watch the video, she's rarely going to hit multiple people with it, so her ability to stack her own passive will be mostly single target.\n\nShe absolutely will need melee allies to reach the same level of effectiveness she has currently. She'll struggle to stun up multiple targets alone.\n\nI'd even prefer if Sej's E was restricted to just her stacking it, at least then you'd be able to let her stack it in less hits and make her ult more threatening by having it stack up her passive (if it already does do this I'll rescind this, can't really be sure yet).","replies":[{"poster":"DunkinNoobs","date":"2017-04-15T02:38:22.508+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not a fan either.

They're melee, sure but they're low attackspeed squishy melees. There's also a good chance that they'll kill a squishy before the stun becomes a factor.\n\nWho you'd actually want are tanky bruisers who attack quickly. Irelia, Jax, Shyvana, Shen ect. Maybe also champs like Yi, Fiora and Tryndamere. Renekton Also gets an honourable mention for being able to AA 4 times almost instantly with his AA-Fury W, most likely Sej requires 5 stacks (that would be my guess for the number anyway) so this would leave the enemy 1 AA off of another stun, if it's 4 you just cut out the first AA.\n\nAlso another potential oddity of this, does Sejuani now want attack speed? Is she going to buy something like a Phantom Dancer or Wit's End which still offers her survivability but which allows her more stuns? My gut feeling on this is yes, unless Riot has made that new W very spamable and made it interrupt her AAs, which would really hurt her jungle.","replies":[{"poster":"EROTIC RAID BOSS","date":"2017-04-15T03:06:46.520+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well you can usually get a melee bruiser or tank up top mid lane is a position though where you'd see a big impact from having an assassin over a mage with sejuani. Fast attack speed isn't necessarily the issue if you're all trying to hit someone plus assassins have good target selection and mobility.\n\nAlso tank supports over mages. \n\nI agree in a little concerned she'll be too niche I like to be able to play my favorite champions every game if I want not just when we get the right comp","replies":[{"poster":"LankPants","date":"2017-04-15T03:11:54.868+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Sure, but why should you expect your top laner who mains Vlad not to play Vlad because you main Sejuani or vies versa.
