At the end of my game no score was shown and I did not receive any chests but did gain a key fragment. Beyond that everyone on my team claimed they received two chests from that game, with our Tryndamere claiming he got an S-. The other person who got at least an S- did not say who they were, or as I suspect it was me who got it but could not see it happen. Sadly, I did not take a screenshot of the post game lobby, so I tried to be as detailed as possible.\nHere is the link to the game results online if that helps any: http://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/2125913557/227205348 \nPS: I was the Janna, just in case that is not shown in the match history.\nEdit: I remembered another important detail. This game put me into my Bronze I Promotional Series, but I did not receive the message that usually accompanies this event. I figure that's an important thing to note.\nEdit number 2: I have discovered that I only received an A for the game I mentioned above, or at least so say the client, but that does not resolve the rest of the issue pertaining to whether or not Tryndamere got at least an S- and if so why I did not get a chest. \nEdit number 3: As of 5:00 PM MST, I got the notification that I qualified for my promo series, almost half an hour after the game ended. I still have yet to have gotten the chest.
