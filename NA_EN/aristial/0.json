I am curious because most of the people i know play with anywhere between 20 and 50 ping but i play with a lot more than that. \r\n\r\n\r\nI personally play with an average ping of anywhere between 660 and 750 on average and yes there is no typo there.

It fluctuates constantly until my entire family is asleep and I've waited a little bit so my ISP is no longer observing my throughput, and then I get the desired 60-63 (which is the best ping I could possibly get in my location as well as peeps in California) simply due to server location.","replies":[{"poster":"Aristial","date":"2016-11-25T23:55:50.291+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have satellite internet as well for the same reason lmao.
