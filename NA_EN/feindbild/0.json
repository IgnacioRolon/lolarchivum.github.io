While moving, especially while moving with a speed boost, the model of whatever champion I'm playing begins to shake or stutter almost as if they were experiencing an fps drop on just the champion, while everything else remains at 60+. However, it will occasionally spread to the rest of the screen in the case of being in combat. I had never had any issue like this till the last patch went in. I've already attempted to repair the client just in case to no avail. Its preventing me from playing because it without fail triggers a migraine after a few minutes, and I'm going to miss out on participating in ranked preseason unless I can find a fix.","replies":[{"poster":"Feindbild","date":"2016-12-07T04:58:00.963+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Still need help, doesn't occur during spectates or replays, only happens if I'm playing and focus the screen on my champion. Otherwise I'm going to have to quit the game, since I can't play without getting a migraine now.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-01T19:06:41.073+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you performed any recent driver updates?  I have a feeling that this might be an issue caused by a driver, so I suggest using the [FPS issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting) guide in this case to make sure all of that is in order.  It may also be worth trying to rollback your driver to help rule out possibilities.  Let me know what you find.","replies":[{"poster":"Feindbild","date":"2016-12-04T20:08:20.179+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So, it would appear the issue is related to vertical sync. If turned off, the issue of the champion shaking stops, but then the screen starts to tear like an old tv would with a section across the screen being out of sync, but as soon as its turned back on, that stops and the champion shaking returns.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Feindbild","date":"2016-12-02T07:00:48.416+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually hadn't done a driver update recently until earlier today, and sadly the issue still persists. Managed to get a less severe clip of it.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7m6mp0HnS3U&feature=youtu.be\n\nI'm probably going to try uninstalling and reinstalling next. Again, this only began when 6.23 went in and I'm not having any issues on any other games. I'm using a GTX 970M","replies":[]},{"poster":"King Baconator","date":"2016-12-01T21:21:27.126+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am having the same issue, and im PRETTY sure that it has something to do with the geforce experience update (at least for me)","replies":[]}]}
