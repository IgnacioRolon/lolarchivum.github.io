I understand this and accept it however for the next five games I wasn't AFK and I didn't leave the game or disconnect and I got another leavebuster for another five games. So I play the next five games without leaving or disconnecting and I get another one. I don't know why I keep getting them because I haven't left or been disconnected within the five games of me playing them and then as soon as I played the five games I get another one. Please fix this as I just spent about 60 bucks on your game and if I keep getting leave Buster when I'm not leaving I'm going to be pretty upset. Thank you for your time, and please get down to the situation.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-11T20:54:10.905+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"[Leaverbuster](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ) won't accrue on your account unless you experience game interruptions.  To be more specific, let's say you d/c but return to the game, that can still count because the match is still down a player.  Looking into your specific issue, it doesn't look like the lower priority queues were random.
