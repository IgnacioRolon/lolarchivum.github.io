It'd be smart to keep all of her abilities as one consistent ability, but with alternate secondary effects.  Ice could slow, Fire could apply a DoT, and Electricity would do additional damage to nearby targets.  Applicably, her Ult (Or a different ability perhaps) could allow her to change elements and grant her some additional effects so as not to take up an item slot.  Something fun might even be that her passive constantly shifts between elements every time she casts a spell, giving all of her spells (In the case of a mage, I'm guessing three varying attack spells and something with utility and defense), making her kit extremely malleable and giving the champ a higher skill cap.\n\nWhat you're suggesting gives her way to much control in an early game laning phase, since you could always just chose the element that best suits to counter your opponent, but at the same time forcing players how to learn a champ several times over, forcing them to make a broad choice at the beginning of the game when you have no real judge of exactly the skill of your opponent.  Also, it'd take up an item slot, which has been a difficult job for Riot in balancing Victor and various coding problems that Rengar had until they outright REMOVED his personal item.\n\nI like the concept of a shifting elemental caster though.  It has a lot of potential.

It's been done.  With the master of elements schtick, a passive that alternates through elements is a fresh idea, doesn't re-hash the special item concept, and I honestly think it'd be a lot more fun to play.\nIn that respect, I'd keep it to three or four elements:  Fire, Ice/Water, Electricity, and Wind/air.  Earth isn't really established in a unique way as far as game mechanics go, Void (Dark) is less of an element and more of an alternate plane, Plant is... plants... not an element.","replies":[{"poster":"Aelbeageu","date":"2015-03-22T07:22:56.839+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok we dont call them elements then.We call it \"NATURAL FORCE\" and dark force isn't been needed force to have.There are 4 essential elements and 4 secondary elements,remember this from alchemy \nhttp://images.unurthed.com/Holmyard-four-elements-22.jpg\nCOLD=ICE\nHOT=LIGHTNING\nDRY=PLANT ( you may not like it)\nFLUID=VOID","replies":[{"poster":"ModelT","date":"2015-03-22T08:24:04.231+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's not so much the elements I'm arguing against, but just considering established elements already IN LoL that would give effects to the spells based on what people are used to, you know?","replies":[{"poster":"Aelbeageu","date":"2015-03-22T10:22:14.962+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry I couldn't understand it,my English isn't good enough...\nAlso I forgot to say this champion should be different and you compared her passive with Viktor's.There can be change.For example if she buys rylai she gains ice force with different item she gains different force but if you ask that what happens when she buys 2 items which can give her the power.There should be a restriction like she can't buy other items after players first choice.\nIf you don't like it too.There can be an option for players to choose which force they want to play...","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Aelbeageu","date":"2015-03-22T18:22:08.917+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"updated the concept. :)","replies":[]}]}
