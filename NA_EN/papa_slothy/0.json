I reset my internet and found that it fixed the problem for about 5 minutes. This is less about \"riots servers bla bla\" and more a cry for help. I have no idea what might be causing this and i'm just wondering if anyone can help.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-13T04:25:03.593+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If resetting your modem temporarily resolves it, then the issue may be caused by your modem in the first place. Have you contacted your ISP regarding the issue? If not, it may be a good idea so they can test your equipment and replace it, if it ends up being faulty.","replies":[{"poster":"Papa Slothy","date":"2017-02-13T07:58:23.483+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ah thank you, i'll try that","replies":[]}]}]}
