Be cool if they added a high scaling Yasuo style champion of the full AP favoring variety, heck could be neat if this champion would toe to toe Yasuo throughout the game as an equal. Just making sure this one doesn&#039;t make half of league wanna bang their head on the desk. \n\n\nSpare of the moment day dreaming... \nWould be very unique to have a champion that scales well with Crit and AP in a passive and/or their abilities. It could be a modified effect on this champion where the crit value adds bonus magic dmg to the auto attacks based on a combination of the amount of crit and the amount of AP(requiring both to have any) instead of it traditional doubleing of AD dmg randomly. The scaling dmg abilities could utilize the amount of crit the champion has to increase the abilities damage based on the percent crit chance up to 100% more. \nThis in order to promote unique builds such as this: {{item:3115}}  {{item:3046}} {{item:3020}} {{item:3087}}   {{item:3151}} {{item:3089}} \n\nThis champion could be THE swordsman of the shuriman desert in modern Runteria following the brooding lone wanderer trope or somthing of the like.","replies":[{"poster":"Mr Voidling","date":"2019-01-24T06:50:54.907+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Once crit item changes happen it'll be a long shot. Needing 4 items for 100% crit is the direction it's looking like Rito wants to go, so 25% chance per item. Given, Yas will still only need 2 if this happens, and Trynd will only need 3. But... There won't be a lot of room for other items if you want 100% chance on any other champ.","replies":[{"poster":"Boatwhistle","date":"2019-01-24T07:01:24.390+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, up to 100%... 50% could be fine, the scaling will decide this. Its not entirely illogical. 100 AP with the modified use of crit could be more valuable to the hypothetical champion then just more AP up to around 50% where more AP produces the larger numbers. Perhaps the Crit could do a lot more for base damages then the AP ratios to a point making magic pen items more favorable then the lissandrys and death cap I put up.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kelg","date":"2019-01-24T11:23:47.865+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because their items and runes suck ass.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-01-24T06:54:59.321+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">  brooding lone wanderer trope or somthing of the like.\n\nAP Yasuo, what we never knew we needed!","replies":[{"poster":"Boatwhistle","date":"2019-01-24T07:03:58.673+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I did say a Yasuo style champion?
