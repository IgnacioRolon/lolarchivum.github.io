This would preserve pretty much every other aspect of SR while shortening the game since much of the hold up is people just trying to get the levels/builds they want/need to acheive. I doubt there would even be a lane phase if people could just start the game at 6 and buy a full item with boots, I understand why that would be bad but I am just saying its true. \nThere really should be quick version as many players want the long games and others shorter games. I dont think Twisted Tree Line and Nexus Blitz satiate those desiring shorters games as they dont carry the same sort of enjoyment as is to be had with SR. Riot doesnt like to do this apperently because multiple game modes mean longer ques which is an issue in higher elos as it is.\nHaving precise match making in terms of skill should only really matter in Ranked, as for normals I believe doubling the allowable skill varience is fine. I typically fluxuate between bronze and gold all the time as a casual player, I dont think it would make too much of an effective difference to my enjoyment because of this. I am no expert but according to the experts I've watch on youtube the difference between one elo and the one above it is often subtle not being a better player in everyway imaginable but in a few ways that get a few more advantages and a bit more consistency. By doubleing the skill variance in normals even if half of the entire player base went one way and the other half stayed put the que times should stay the same on existing modes. \n\nEven if you have no interest in a shorter version of summoners rift, or more specifically the version I described, this is still potentially a benefit to you. Without needing to cater to players opposed to long drawn games they can sort of revert the changes aimed to shorten the games such as the vision changes and the the game ending power of baron buff.","replies":[]}
