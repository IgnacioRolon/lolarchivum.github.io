This way ulting to save an ally will be more likely to get them out rather then just putting off the inevitable. Would be really nice if he could get allies out with his shrines giving them more function past lane phase actually. This could make the ability more useful as a way to save allies.","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-02-24T07:46:01.593+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can't tell whether you're on a phone and it autocorrected Mikael's to michael's without capitalization while missing things like \"stasus,\" or if you typed this without autocorrect and are just using \"michael's\" as a meme.","replies":[{"poster":"Boatwhistle","date":"2019-02-25T04:38:47.869+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think I lost some IQ from years of heavy drinking to ignore my lack of happiness in life.

I just feel that bard being the play maker can have issues making the play in the jumbled mess that is team fights. Being able to use michaels like that would allow bard to produce turn arounds even harder then he already does with a well placed ult-redemtion-q. I can understand the concern but this isn't something bard would need to keep IF it turned out broken as hell. Other then providing a better escape for allies or giving them a set up I cant imagine what other situation and synergy would break the game and bullseye bard.","replies":[{"poster":"Boatwhistle","date":"2019-02-24T07:50:18.055+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"eh just thought of one... galio ult-bard ult, michaels galio- galio w taunt- bard q and galio E\n\nthe potential of that combo would be insane both setting up for an inescapable wambo following the galio ult and that cc, we are talking about easily 5-7 seconds of at least three enemies being disabled and they probably just wouldn't live that long anyway with the catalyst being the bard using michaels on the galio. Yeah okay this might be a bad idea.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
