However don't go saying its dumb and pointless without reading the whole thing or your the fool not me. \r\n_\r\n\r\n\r\n{{champion:266}}old  {{champion:84}}* {{champion:31}} {{champion:122}} {{champion:9}} {{champion:114}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:120}} {{champion:420}} {{champion:10}} {{champion:141}} {{champion:64}} {{champion:57}} {{champion:82}} {{champion:75}} {{champion:76}} {{champion:20}} {{champion:2}} {{champion:555}} {{champion:58}} {{champion:107}} {{champion:16}} {{champion:517}} {{champion:223}} {{champion:48}} {{champion:23}} {{champion:8}} {{champion:106}} {{champion:19}} {{champion:5}} {{champion:83}} {{champion:154}} \r\n\r\nThese are champions that in some regard stand out to me as big healers often relying on their ability to do so. Oops I forgot one {{champion:36}}, and maybe there are other I overlooked/missed but that's not important. They are a big group and some rely on it way moe then others, some are extremely ridiculous from how much they can heal... {{champion:8}} (I love this champion so much though). Others have proven to really need their healing {{champion:84}} (I hate her so much though). \r\nThis isn't even including the healing from runes, potions, and items that these and more champions will accumulate during the game. \r\n\r\nProblem with the heals and sustain especially early in the game is it turns over such an advantage for some champions others cant over come often times without relying on the enemies mistakes. On the flip side yo cant just take away/reduce heals from champions like {{champion:8}} {{champion:517}} {{champion:84}} to point out a few as they really do need them the way they are to get through lane and/or be effective in teamfights. \r\nGrevious wounds and ignite are great options to invest in for the all in but if that fails they can bounce back, not only that but few champions laning into these examples want to build an executioners, oblivian orb, or bramble vest as they have very good reason to do other wise... many champions really do need certian items asap to be relevent as the game progresses and i cant think of many pleased to build these early. \r\n\r\nI believe the scope of relevance has been laid out thoroughly...\r\n\r\n**My suggestion is they add a champion that acts as an extreme counter to all healing in the game. **\r\n\r\nWhat I speak is a champion with grievous wounds not only built in as their primary passive but this passive even scales with AP heavily producing a version far more effective then the typical grievous wounds. It would start at a 40% cut to heals but then have a +5-8% per 100 AP scaling. I say AP as mages can do well in each lane as top, mid, and support allowing this champion to be an effective counter across the board. The champion would do DOT damage to an extreme where they apply the passive by landing an ability and one of these abilities does very very little dmg per tick but the tick lasts as long as the abilities cool down adding up to a normal amount of dmg but keeping the grievous on potentially all the time. \r\nAs a consequence however... this champion would have rather unimpressive dmg making them much less effective to champions not relying on heals and sustain only really being an extreme threat to those with a lot of healing to lose. As the game goes on this champion would spread this passive to as many enemy team members as possible being an aoe focused champ harshly denying life steal and spell vamp to those daring to rely on it it in their build and play style. Such a champion would not only be a unique edition to the game but would produce a consistent threat to any champion otherwise abusing ridiculous sustain without having to ruin it completely or take it away all together. \r\n\r\nThis champion would probably be a number one ban for the more extreme cases, but this isn't all bad as it would just open up the opportunity to take what is their biggest counters currently so in a way the issue should there be one would still be fixed.","replies":[{"poster":"PrismalDawn","date":"2019-02-24T10:51:16.441+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{summoner:14}} {{item:3123}} {{item:3165}} \n\nWell, they're pretty fucking useless now","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kelg","date":"2019-02-24T12:51:41.868+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This isn't dota we don't do hard counters here.
