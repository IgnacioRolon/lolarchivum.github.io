The scenario is the when WuKong uses his ult, and then Malzahar uses his ult to suppress WuKong, the damage from Malzahars ult is dealt but Wukong is not suppressed and is able to move around knocking up teammates wherever he pleases. I am not sure if this occurs with Warwicks ult. However, this occurs 100% when done in the above mentioned method. I thank you in advance for looking into this horrible bug.","replies":[{"poster":"Urgot2BKiddinMe","date":"2015-08-08T20:15:10.148+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He's unaffected by the suppression meaning he can still move.
