If I cap the in-game FPS it will stop but I lose out on the action. I just bought a 144hz G-Sync monitor to go with my GTX 1070. I am having the same issue, I cannot leave it uncapped, I need to cap it to the refresh rate of the screen and still get some tearing. I have the latest drivers for everything and have tried many settings in league.

In addition to that, I suggest going over our [FPS issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting) guide for those steps as well as list of troubleshooting steps.  Hope that helps, and grats on your new card!","replies":[{"poster":"goobafish","date":"2016-09-02T19:22:02.196+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks, I have followed all those steps. Because my FPS is ~600 i have to cap it at 144hz so that it doesn't tear. I enabled 4x dynamic resolution to lower the fps, but still have to cap it at 144 so there are no issues. Any other ideas?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-02T20:40:14.130+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd recommend hitting us up in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) so our tech team can take a closer look at this.
