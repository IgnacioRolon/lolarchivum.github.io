For example if they nerfed{{champion:90}} ult range slightly it would definitely be a straight up nerf, not a QoL thing, and yet if it matched up with the range for casting {{summoner:14}} then it would definitely help the Quality of play with him because then I wouldn't accidentally cancel my ult by trying to ignite someone I'm ulting.\n\nBasically it's a somewhat misleading term because I feel like the intention of the term is to indicate that something was changed that should make the champion feel better to play but not necessarily be stronger (except for the increased ease of play). The issue is a lot of changes that straight up make the champion stronger also make them easier to play, which is kind of QoL but isn't really the situation the term was intended for.\n\nI'd say overall the \"purest\" QoL changes are the ones that the player using the champions notices, but his opponent does not. Things like clearer tooltips, better casting indicators, and allowing {{champion:43}}  and {{champion:74}} to ult when stunned would fall under this. Frankly I think the safest way to define it would be this way, so \"Quality of Life changes\" has a very clear meaning. We would then call things like changing AA animations and cast times to be called \"skill cap buffs\", and call increased damage or scaling to be \"stat buffs\".

Example: changing numbers, making a hitbox a different size (changing particles to match the hitbox is QOL), changing cooldowns, etc. These changes are primarily meant to increase/decrease power through direct manipulation of mechanics on how they are played, or the numbers behind the damage.\n\nWhile QOL changes are meant to:\n1. Have champions feel smoother in animations and look. If an AA animation change looks and feels smoother, but the casting time remains the same, it is QOL. On the other hand, if the AA animation changes the numerical value of the cast time, then it is a buff/nerf. See the difference?\n2. Bring more transparency to the champion and/or game, particles were altered to fit the hitbox for example, rather than contradicting visuals vs reality. This way enemies know where things are (in the animation hitbox) and players aren't stuck wondering, \"Why the hell didn't I hit them with that? It went right through them.\"\n3. Fixing bugs that do not deliver the intended effect (although this can also be a buff, I prefer QOL since it is not actually changing the mechanics of a champion, but bringing them in line of where they were always intended to be). Example: Fixing the hitbox on Cassiopeia's ult. Her ult's hitbox was always strange, and sometimes a champion standing just a tad bit in front of her would not get ulted. It was a buff, but wasn't meant to increase power as much as giving players reliability and optimization when ulting. They were _always_ meant to be in the ult in that position, but it wasn't coded right to ensure reliability. Therefore, I call it a QOL fix.\n4. Fixing Tooltip and UI for transparency and ease of use. The latest changes made in the game client that moved teammate position to a different part of the screen, and a cleaner looking shop, are QOL changes for all players and not dependent on any champion. Making it visually appealing doesn't directly affect a players strength, in numerical values.\n\nThere are probably more, but that's all I got off the top of my head.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Swollwonder","date":"2015-07-31T03:28:06.079+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm still waiting for my {{champion:41}}  QOL buff.
