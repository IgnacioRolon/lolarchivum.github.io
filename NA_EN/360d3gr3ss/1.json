With two people ganking him. They do it just like turret diving one attacks then taking his aggro from turrets then the second comes attack switching the aggro. They do this back and forth for 3-4 seconds and I die. \n\n\nside note : 5-6 seconds if i have barrier and hourglass.\n\nI have yet to find a counter to this ganking madness and quit playing hiemer in pubs bc of it.","replies":[{"poster":"360D3GR3SS","date":"2014-11-25T21:46:30.432+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks ill try this next time!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"JadeKnightblazer","date":"2014-11-25T14:14:52.620+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{item:3713}}  Hurts Hiemer greatly...
