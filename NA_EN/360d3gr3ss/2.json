You're comparing an ultimate to a basic ability. One has a cooldown of 10 seconds at max rank, on a champion who will build 40% CDR dropping it to 6 seconds and 650 range, the other is an ultimate with a 60 second cooldown with 375 range on a champion, that at most, will itemize 20-30% CDR, bringing it down to a 48-42 second cooldown. And if you want to talk about base damage and scaling, keep in mind Lee's ult scales with BONUS AD, not total AD. Alistars W has a 275 base damage max rank with 70% TOTAL AP scaling, meaning that if they both build heavy damage (Lee AD, Ali AP), they're both going to do roughly the same amount of damage. So even though it's a stupid comparison to make in an attempt at trying to bring Lee's ult into a bad light, in reality, you're making an argument that Ali's W is potentially even more broken. Nevermind the fact that if he could still AA immediately after W, with a lich bane proc, how much more damage Ali would end up doing.","replies":[{"poster":"Auroramancer","date":"2015-10-11T01:26:26.319+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let's do some math crafting for this if we're going to be comparing hard values:\n2 damage items (typical build), level 18\n\n{{champion:12}} {{item:3027}} {{item:3100}} (lich bane is used because you are considering it for your argument)\nSay, +25 AP from runes+masteries\nBase Attack Damage: 123 AD\n205 AP total\nHeadbutt damage: 418 damage\nLich bane damage: 195 on-hit damage\n_**Total damage from Headbutt + Lich Bane proc + auto attack: 736 damage**_\n\n{{champion:64}} {{item:3074}} {{item:3035}} \nSay, +20 AD from runes+masteries\nTotal Attack Damage: 251 AD (116 base + 135 bonus)\nDragon's Rage damage: 600 base + 270 bonus = 870 total damage\nAuto attack damage: 251 damage\n_**Total damage from Dragon's Rage + auto attack = 1,121 damage**_\n\nKeep in mind that I'm making the argument **_against_** Lee Sin being allowed to auto attack after he ults, I'm **_not_** making the case for Alistar to get his auto attack after headbutt back. \n\nHard number crunching, Lee Sin's ult+auto combo deals _**152% more**_ damage than Alistar's headbutt+auto combo. \n\nNow we also have to consider the context of how these knockback ability+auto combos operate in:\nAlistar's combo makes use of his disengage but also a gap-closer.

And we're not even counting auto attacks he can string in there from using his Safeguard as a gap closer and using Tempest as another damage source.\n\nBottom fucking line, yes Alistar's combo will hurt like hell, _**but at least you can live from it and retaliate after it's over**_. \nWith Lee Sin's combo, you're barely going to live, and _**one fuck-up after the combo is over will kill you.**_\n\nAlistar may have been toxic with the mechanic, and thank god it was removed, but Lee Sin needs to fucking have it removed as well.

It's a simple matter of numbers tuning.\n\nIt was an issue for alistar because he bought a sheen, so Sheen-AA adds +200% base ad to the damage of a 10 second cd ability. Even Lee's ult doesn't have that (it's bonus AD.

However, the reason is because I think it doesn't make thematic sense that you can punch someone after you kick them away, and because it makes Lee's skill floor a little bit higher, which means he's easier to balance for both high and low elo.\n\nBut I do think the reasons behind the change are important, and saying \"We should do it to Lee because we did it to Alistar\" is not a good enough reason in my book.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"My Waifu Vanilla","date":"2015-10-12T00:24:07.676+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is so cute of you to put rank 3 ult to prove a point.

There is NO inconsistence here and it aint \"a pile of smelly BS\". You're drawing way too much parallel between these two abilities. They aren't the same.\n\nAnd per previous comments, even if lee could sneak it in without any counterplay, ali could still do it a bajillion times more often.\n\nBoth cooldown and range are huge factors. These are NOT small differences.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Akali is SO HOT","date":"2015-10-11T15:45:38.099+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol I guess op doesn't remember the 90% banrate Alistar in last year's worlds","replies":[]},{"poster":"HaiLnKill","date":"2015-10-10T18:39:52.459+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"rip alistar top with{{item:3057}} \ngood old times","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hyrum Graff","date":"2015-10-11T02:13:40.886+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":3,"body":"#Your thread assumes that this combo is problematic.\n\n\n#*It is not.*\n\n>Dragon's Rage RANGE: 375\n>COOLDOWN: 90 / 75 / 60\n>Becomes available at level 6\n\n>Headbutt RANGE: 650\n>COOLDOWN: 14 / 13 / 12 / 11 / 10\n>Available at level 1.\n\nI hope this illustrates that  **the combo is problematic a problem in lane.**\n\nWhen you can max E and every 10 seconds, have a medium-range, targeted ability that lets you deny the opponent from csing AND leave them completely unable to trade back at you, while also being potent harass (esp. after sheen). That's basically an ability that says, \"don't come near me or else.\" In lane, this translates to, \"Don't stay in lane, or else.\"\n\nTHAT is not okay. Giving lee an extra bit of damage on his ult is just another level to balance his damage on, not a game mechanic that is inherently broken.\n\nEdit: I'm not saying that the lever is *tuned* correctly. I'm saying there's nearly no difference between a 2x scaling AD ult that you can AA after and a 3x scaling AD ult that you can't, assuming both Lee's are proficient enough to pull of the aa.","replies":[{"poster":"LeeDark","date":"2015-10-11T05:02:09.149+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"Right, because a 2x scaling AD ult needs extra damage.","replies":[{"poster":"Hyrum Graff","date":"2015-10-11T14:56:40.767+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=LeeDark,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=E1whUoAA,comment-id=000c0000,timestamp=2015-10-11T05:02:09.149+0000)\n>\n> Right, because a 2x scaling AD ult needs extra damage.\n\nWhat's the difference between a 2x scaling AD ult that you can AA after and a 3x scaling AD ult that you can't, assuming both Lee's are proficient enough to pull of the aa?\n\nThe point is it's just another lever to balance.
