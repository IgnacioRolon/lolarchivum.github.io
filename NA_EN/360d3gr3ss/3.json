Some of these are likely to assist the mage with last hitting minions and basic harassment via AAs in lane. Especially if the mage is mana hungry or dependent, they don't want to waste their spells wave clearing so they might have a little help in terms of base AD since it isn't likely to impact their post-laning game.","replies":[{"poster":"360D3GR3SS","date":"2015-02-16T10:18:55.816+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel like with such potent burst she does not need easier last hitting. I think because she is mobile/bursty she needs to be giving up the ability to easily last hit via autos earlier on. Her mana costs are fairly high but mages have been known (not all) to have low AD because they farm efficiently with their abilities. Her auto attacks are a little too good at trading with other mages.","replies":[{"poster":"Tsunday","date":"2015-02-16T10:47:37.759+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"The only ability LB can actually farm with is also her gap closer and her escape that is why she has higher AD. Yes mages are known for being able to farm with their abilities but Leblanc really can't without losing her mobility. While it might not seem like a lot it's like forcing Tristana or Ezreal or Akali to use their dashes to farm. LeBlanc isn't Lissandra she doesn't have the choice between using her claw or her other AoE abilities to farm LB relies on high AD to last hit without going automatically oom as well as to last hit without getting shoved under turret by literally every other midlaner.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Yordle Xayah","date":"2015-02-16T11:03:14.341+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Nerfs?
