My fps drops when I turn it to borderless but there is no flickering, and I don't know how to fix it. I tried re-installing and the hextech repair tool but nothing seems to be working. Also, my pbe account has the same glitch as well. So I don't know what do so can someone please help me.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-26T22:33:50.570+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wonder if this is somehow related to an outdated graphics driver since this is more related to how your pc is rendering the graphics rather than patch/client related which would affect 100% of players. Double check for any drivers you might have missed as well as checking to make sure the game dvr feature is still turned off. If nothing seems to help, hit up our techs in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to see if they can look through your game logs to see what's wrong.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Teechmehow2dougy","date":"2017-11-27T22:29:01.228+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you have a Freesync monitor?
