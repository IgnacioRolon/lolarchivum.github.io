This affects my gameplay quite a lot as you can probably assume, but I can't seem to find the cause of it. I have 2 brothers who play on the same connection as me and they don't have any lag, so it's likely my laptop, but nothing I do seems to work. So far I've tried freeing up disk space by uninstalling things and removing saved files, as well as giving League higher CPU priority and disabling packet coalescing. Any other ideas you guys might have that I could try?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-08-22T20:07:09.257+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you might be experiencing packet loss.
