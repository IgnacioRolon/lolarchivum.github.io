Once Jinx has her Attack Speed items she pretty much has an ungimped version of Judgment which can be used from 700 units away, why is that considered balanced when you intentionally make Garen's Judgment weaker for, what you guys claim, balance?\n\ntl;dr nerf Jinx\n\nEDIT: We've been compromised, this was actually a secret buff Garen thread trying to fish for support through joining the nerf Jinx circlejerk. I tried.\n\nhttp://st.elohell.net/public/chill/21bea9650b88f481380cf649cb0ac76d.jpg","replies":[]}
