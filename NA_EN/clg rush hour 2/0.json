After seven post-buff **Sejuani** games, I get the feeling she may be a sleeping giant. I've also seen **Vladimir** doing serious work in more than a few games.

But I have to let you in on the fact that the higher elo you go, you will see people trying to punish your early game more because they know if you get farmed up, a Jax always win. So just a heads up while you climb.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CLG Rush Hour 2","date":"2014-12-22T15:47:18.700+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And your laning phase wasn't as brutal as it ought to be?","replies":[{"poster":"Paradrakor","date":"2014-12-22T16:05:08.052+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nope...
