You might be better off making an account with the new sign up, but you can also submit an [account recovery form](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=72416) so our account team can look into this for you.","replies":[{"poster":"Khristophoros","date":"2017-10-12T21:59:52.245+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It was extremely legacy, but I got it re-enabled back in 2015.
