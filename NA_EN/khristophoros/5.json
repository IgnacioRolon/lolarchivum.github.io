Between 1 to 30, you outright get more BE then you would IP (as long as you are disenchanting champions), and you get more with the current system then the old from 30 to 35, while the amount drops off from 35 to 50, the system is better as long as you are actively using the price reduction system.","replies":[{"poster":"Ztoka","date":"2018-03-29T22:25:30.072+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"I disagree very strongly..

So, assuming that you are god like, every game is a win, you play ten games a day, and each one is thirty minutes, it takes 202 games to get from level 1 to 30. \n\nWith the old system, factoring in first win of the day, you will reach an end goal of 20637 IP, with the current system, it is impossible to get a hard exact of how much BE you get from 1 to 30, however, we do have youtube videos such as this one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25CWE4zXKfk&t=31s\n\nThat the end goal of BE will get you 22 k if not more BE (from disenchanting of course.)\n\nThe system only slows down past level 35 and I have done the math of that in another post, between 35 to 50, you lose around 400 to 800 IP that you would of had from the old system. For vets, the system is slower because the chance of them getting the new champion from a chest on release is low as fuck, for first time players, it is faster and the math proves that.","replies":[{"poster":"Ztoka","date":"2018-03-30T15:23:30.426+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Call it false and impossible all you want.

The problem you have is that now you're no longer getting IP drips after each game but a big BE infusion after a level up. This gives you an illusion that you're not progressing towards buying champs faster because you have level up gaps in between. However, you have FotD that gives you flat 50 BE a day, which avoids those specific problems of being a few BE short of buying a champ and having to actually wait to level up again in order to purchase.\n\nFurthermore, getting the champ shards you actually want is good (from level up capsules).\nIf you're spending a shard to purchase a champion, you get that champion at a BE discount of 40%. So if you get Vi (for example) who costs 6300 BE in the store, spending a shard from the loot menu to upgrade it to champion permanent costs you 3780 BE.\n\nSpending the same champion shard (if you own them already) on Mastery level 6 or 7 saves you respectively 2450 and 2850 BE. But level 7 requires two champion shards.","replies":[{"poster":"Lucky Moniker","date":"2018-03-29T15:51:58.753+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":8,"body":"Wrong","replies":[{"poster":"Tomoe Gozen","date":"2018-03-29T19:29:40.014+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lucky Moniker,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=vJX9NXBQ,comment-id=000200010000,timestamp=2018-03-29T15:51:58.753+0000)\n>\n> Wrong\n\nIf you're one of those people who doesn't want to \"believe\" in evidence that's supported by the math, there's really nothing to discuss with you.

It allows players with an excess of BE to stock up over the season and then RIot to stock it up with content that's to be sold for BE. It was open at the start of the Season 8 with URFwick being the big thing and sure, not many players wanted that or had to spend that amount. However, chromas were there as well.\n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/115014872088-The-Essence-Emporium-FAQ\n\nhttp://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Essence_Emporium","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Durzaka","date":"2018-03-30T05:47:18.402+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"ok.\n\nBut let me ask you this.
