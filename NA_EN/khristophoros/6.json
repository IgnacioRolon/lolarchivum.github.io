At least from what I could see (on mobile), Galio is 17, teemo and Amumu are 14, and Voli is..16? 18? We can’t see builds, we can’t see CS, and we can’t see individual KDAs, so we have no idea who has what. Galio seems fairly fed though compared to the others. \n\nI also see several summoner’s and ults down for Teemo, Mumu, and Voli, so they were at a decent disadvantage in that fight to begin with.\n\n> \n> The only reason Galio took dmg from Fizz was because Fizz managed to last long enough to use an ability on him after his shield ended. This was after Galio already took 0 dmg from his ult, so Fizz had no other burst remaining to finish him anyway.\n> \n\nYou mean an AP assassin hit a champ that’s mainly an anti-AP tank when their defensive CDs were down and did damage but did little to none when they were up? Sounds like the way things are supposed to work with tanks and assassins (hint: tanks are supposed to resist assassin burst, and Galio doubly so since he’s anti-AP).\n\n> Galio still gets half of the damage reduction against physical, which in this case was 50% or higher, so I don&#x27;t think he&#x27;d care that much about it unless they had a huge amount of it.\n\nYou realize that you cannot have more than 100% DR, right? So physical would not be more than 50%. He starts at 40% at max rank and it’s an additional 8% per 100 bonus MR, which you won’t get near 100% as a tank because you rarely get above 300 total MR, so that’s 16%, and we’re at 56% magic damage reduction.\n\nFrom there, you would need straight AP at 5% per 100 AP. We’re missing 44% so we need almost 900 AP with only 4 item slots. Now, you could run full AP, at which point you need 1200 AP to hit 100% magic damage reduction, but you are only tanky in that window, as we saw. \n\nGalio would’ve died if there was physical damage, or if Fizz played the fight differently, like not using his full burst when he saw Galio channelling W. \n\n> \n> The damage chart at the end says it all. Galio just exists on a different level.\n\nPerhaps it’s extreme, but we don’t see the full picture.
