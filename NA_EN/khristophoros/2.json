I was also tilted while I posted this thread. I keep having games where some assassin pops off and snowballs off of a few early misteps by somebody on my team. Right now my MMR in normals is pretty tanked so it might be that but I think the game is currently too volatile.\n\nI don't like that you apparently don't find it to be a big deal. Like you're calling it an \"accepted risk\". I think it would make the game more fun and less toxic if you cared more about volatility and hard snowballing.\n\nIDK I think my issue stems from the fact that a lot of champions are designed to depend on snowballing. Like give Draven 1 kill early and you're gonna have to seriously respect him for a while. But if he doesn't get a kill early he has trouble making an impact. Get camped mid against a Zed and he can easily snowball off 1-2 ganks. Then get raged at by your jungler who didn't care to help out.\n\nVolatility is toxic.","replies":[{"poster":"Ahri Inari","date":"2018-03-29T02:53:47.834+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"The problem is this view point isn't that much one sided.

You wouldn't have issues where supports were too overpowered and mitigate your entire damage combo's, ADC's still needed 3 items to reach their lategame and the items weren't cheap either, Mid-laners could roam top or bottom and make plays and take objectives off of those plays, Top wasn't treated like an island the champion picks in that lane would have great influence in teamfights, and junglers wouldn't need to be so gank reliant to get their powerspikes because the jungle respawned fast enough to where they could keep up in lvls.\n\nThat to me was one of the most balanced times in League.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"SilentBomber","date":"2018-03-29T13:46:37.039+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RiotRepertoir,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=EZPoEudz,comment-id=0008,timestamp=2018-03-29T02:00:12.610+0000)\n>\n> Feels like there&#x27;s some false advertisement going on here.\n> \n> The stated goal is to make contesting and fighting your opponent in lane more valuable and available.

I'm not saying nerf them to the ground, they can have better scaling if their early game is nerfed but getting them out of lanes or making their ganks less powerful may be a way to approach this issue.\n\nThis could also solve the solo-carrying problem people are having. For you to be able to solo carry as a solo laner you don't need to win a 1 v 1, you need to be able to 2 v 1 the enemy solo laner and the enemy jungler. \nNow this isn't something new, the jungler existed for a long ass time but what changed is the junglers power in the early game to shut down these leads the solo laner can use to solo carry \n(There are other reasons why solo carrying got a lot harder but this is another topic we aren't discussing right now, unless you want to of course)\n\nI just really don't think FORCING them to interact more is the play here. This would be a temporary solution to a permanent problem and these rarely work out well.\nPrime example: {{champion:114}} and {{item:3076}} \n\nOf course there are other factors like that mana isn't even a thing anymore.
