If it&#039;s as simple as, you don&#039;t have enough champions and you need a lot of BE, post that. If it&#039;s something else, post what it is. Even if it&#039;s Urfwick and nothing else, post that. I think it would help Riot if they know exactly what people feel like they&#039;re missing out on.\r\n\r\nPersonally I don&#039;t know what I&#039;d use BE for, which makes it hard for me to contribute to threads about the refund, but at the same time I want to understand the issue and help in some way.\r\n\r\nIt appears that Riot wants to make things fair but I have trouble imagining what they can give to us that would be equivalent to all the IP we spent on runes over the past few years.\r\n\r\nSo the point of this thread is post what exactly you&#039;d use the BE for. I believe it would be good feedback for Riot.","replies":[]}
