Otherwise you can't get close and she can do whatever she wants in lane depending on jungles.\n\nSure, there is counterplay AFTER she uses it- or before she has it stacked. YET, all she has to do is stay back to eliminate that weakness. Her q range is huge, so she takes no penalties for that weakness. If she wasn't able to farm during that time, that would be more reasonable, that would be an actual weakness.\n\nIf she has flash up you can't walk into lane. If you don't know where the enemy jungle is you can't contest anything, one stun hit and you ded. Point and click from a mile away.\n\nJust, sit down, mmk got it? I can't believe you actually thought you had outplayed. ffs","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Khristophoros","date":"2018-08-04T05:51:25.208+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah when they removed things like that, and gutted Kassadin, everything else became fair game in my eyes.

The AP ratio is a little bit high but there are still many things that are more problematic.\n\nAnnie's kit as a whole is a moderate offender because her rotation is extremely clean and reliable. It's easy for her to instantly kill a target with almost no counterplay (tiny delays on W and R make them flashable but otherwise there's no much you can do) However, I only consider her kit as a whole a moderate offender because she has no built in mobility and low cast ranges, so positioning matters a lot for her and her opponents.\n\nI find reliable burst to be more of a problem on champions with high mobility because there is basically no positioning based counterplay. Instead the counterplay has to be somewhere else. In a lot of those cases because of their item and rune options, it leaves me wondering where the counterplay is.\n\nIdeally I wish Annie would get a small rework (think like Warwick's rework) but there are bigger problems.","replies":[]}]}]}
