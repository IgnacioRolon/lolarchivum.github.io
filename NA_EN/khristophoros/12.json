He has some crippling problems which is why he does not see serious play.\n\n\nWaveclear.\n\nBrand doesn't have a lot of tools. He has damage and a very conditional stun. He has no mobility or utility. By all rights he should have godlike waveclear. Last time I played him I was constantly pushed to my turret by an Orianna, a champion overloaded with utility.\n\nIn order to optimize his waveclear, he has to Q a minion, then E, then W. So he has to use too much mana and put everything on cooldown. It's not a very viable strategy because it leaves him no way to trade with his lane opponent and they will capitalize on that. EDIT: So to be clear I don't actually do this.\n\n\nHis ult.\n\nThere are two problems with the ult. The first problem is it's very common that it will just fizzle and do nothing because if any target it's bouncing to becomes invulnerable or has a spell shield, the whole ult is gone. This isn't a good way to do counterplay because it's too binary and Brand has no control over it. He can choose the best target to ult and somebody else will pop their hourglass and that's it, his ult is over and did basically nothing.\n\nThe second problem is the cooldown is much too long for what it does. It's highly conditional, so it doesn't have the problem Darius' ult had where you'd just go up and do your combo on your lane opponent every time you saw them. For Brand to solo somebody it's ridiculous. He has to land his passive on all the minions to ensure his ult will bounce back to the enemy champion. He should have more chances to attempt this. He should just have more chances to attempt his ult in general because of how poor the damage can be.","replies":[{"poster":"Chicken Sailor","date":"2014-10-27T17:44:04.357+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I feel like Brand is okay for the most part aside from his ult. His ult is absolutely amazing when the enemies are all bunched up but it does almost nothing when they're spread out. Overall I think Brand fulfills his role as an immobile high burst mage though.","replies":[{"poster":"Khristophoros","date":"2014-10-27T17:49:53.477+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"The point I was making about his ult is that when people use anything that stops one bounce, it stops the entire ult. It doesn't matter if the other team bunches up because they just cancel the ult and continue on with the teamfight. If you want an effective teamfight ult, play Rumble because Brand's ult is not a solid choice in its current state.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Creamy Seaman","date":"2014-10-27T18:55:01.348+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why are you q e w minions? That is a waste of mana. \nw then e and a few autos are enough from levels 1-6. w alone should start one hitting caster minions at level 8. \nAlso brand should not be losing to orianna. You are doing something wrong.","replies":[{"poster":"Khristophoros","date":"2014-10-27T19:53:17.265+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In that game I was only using W and E on minions. Ori was outpushing me. I ended up getting the upper hand later but that's kinda irrelevant.\n\nAlso his damage is harder to land. Ori is more consistent which is why she's a serious pick and Brand is not.","replies":[{"poster":"Creamy Seaman","date":"2014-10-27T20:49:16.017+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ori's skills are much harder to land than brand's. Just walk away from her ball.","replies":[{"poster":"Infleto","date":"2014-12-04T01:48:18.693+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In the real word.  That does not work.  Brand can't combo Ori with out walking up to get in range with E.  Ori out ranges Brands E by a very large amount.  Ori is far more mobile and can back off any attempt brand tries for a combo.    She can poke and always keep spacing.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"DSRM Mobius","date":"2014-10-27T18:56:08.836+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yea brand will bully ori out of lane","replies":[{"poster":"Creamy Seaman","date":"2014-10-27T18:59:10.692+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He can out damage her at all stages in the game.\n\nEdit: Unless the enemy she has wukong.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Infleto","date":"2014-12-04T01:17:13.960+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh god he need a buff","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kingsgrave","date":"2014-10-28T02:27:24.669+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Brand is mostly super bland, uninspired and uninteresting.

He's a pretty strong situational aoe burst mage. I would maybe say a MS buff whenever he lands his Q? Other than that he is perfect and maybe have his ult have minimum damage if it only hits 1 target? Or increase the bounce radius?","replies":[{"poster":"Khristophoros","date":"2014-10-27T19:58:27.203+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"His mana costs are fine but since his most effective strategy is to play attrition with his pokes, you kinda need Athene's for the long term sustain. The only way to change that would be to give him a mana restore mechanic. I don't think it's really a problem though. Most mages have to use Athenes if they want to sustain over a long period of time like that.","replies":[]}]}]}
