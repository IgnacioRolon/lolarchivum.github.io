I personally think homeguards only feels better because it is one big boost instead of a long lasting smaller effect. That does not mean it is always the strongest choice.\n\nIt sounds elo specific to me. I am only SIlver right now, and highest I have reached is Gold, so I can't say Homeguard is omni-present at higher elo's. I tend to go for Alacrity or Captain depending on role or situation, and typically only Homeguard when my team is losing or we have lost/will lose an inhib turret or two if we can't reach them fast. That said, i always feel a bit noobish with Alacrity, since the buff from base means that even with my burst in movement speed, I reach the fight much later, and the buff is so small compared to flat ms buffs, that it's usually just to keep up, and doesn't provide an edge in most scenarios. I see homeguard as a \"defence\" enchantment, but it's often used aggressively too, at least at my elo. Auto Homeguard shouldn't be level based, but time (after 30 minutes perhaps) and that's IF it is introduced, but for a while people have been saying that the other enchantments are underwhelming. I think the most useful is Captain, but only for 1 maybe two champs.\n\nIf you think about Distortion, doesn't the time saved from TP use, seem less than the time saved from Homeguard??? Homeguard is immediately and always useful for getting back to lane, to objectives or teamfights, distortion is a little helpful every 5 or so minutes or whatever the CDR for it is. The other items are not bad, just so niche that 9/10 homeguard is better, that's just how it feels for me anyway","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Old Man Teeto","date":"2015-04-27T18:44:04.334+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The difference is the *impact* of the enchant on those who get strong benefits from building the item.\n\nWhile Alacrity, Furor and Distortion definitely aren't without use, they're significantly less impactful.\n\n-------\n\nDistortion tends to be used to give champions who need their flash more often for fighting.
