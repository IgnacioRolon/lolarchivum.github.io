So the question is, should a super tanky champion deal more with an execute than a super squishy champion who cannot gain more max health? Pyke's ult at level 15 would be 525 + 140% AD. Assuming he had around 300 AD that'd be 945 damage. Assuming Darius had 300 AD that'd be 850(not taking into account the 135+150% AD damage from his passive). It's not that huge of a stretch in damage(in fact with Darius' passive it's far more). As for it being AOE, unless you have 5 people right on top of each other you're not gonna be getting any pentakills, and again, if you don't kill anyone in it, or they dodge it, you don't get a reset.

He gets BC, maybe one other items then fight tank items, Spirit or Deadman's. Let's say he does have BC and Titanic Hydra, that's 80 bonus attack damage his other items are boots and a deadman's at 15 right? So 400, if he gets all the stacks, plus 120, so 520, plus passive damage in that time, so 5 stacks, at 15 is 135 plus 150% bAD, so 250. Of course not all that 250 will be used if he actually ults. :P Plus his passive is physical damage so you can get armour against it.\n\nNow Pyke, at 15, he can't build HP so let's say he 'supporting' and has a Remnant of Ascent which is 350 HP, that's 25 bAD, then he had Duskblade and Youmuu's, so another 110 bAD, 135 total. At 15 that's 525 plus 189, 714 damage.... meaning anyone below 700 HP is dead. No stacking up there, run in with W, press R before people see you and win. Darius can't do that. Imagine if he could, if he does it's only 200 plus 75% bAD which isn't much.\n\nBut I do like people talking about this, it shows the Ult has contention from both sides.

Pike might get AD for HP, but he cant raise his max HP with bonus HP like everyone else can. That is a HUGE thing, and it means that pike when behind will be in a famine state... Unless his ult is a threshold execute, which makes him viable at all stages from all points of famine. \nFurther, pike is melee and has few ways to escape damage. His W has a large camo radius and his E is his only actually useful mobility tool (and is only really useful to escape after being caught or to run over walls from something). His ult isnt like zed, talons, or ekkos; using it to escape is a bad idea due to its cooldown and important to his kit. Its kind of hard to assassinate someone with his Q and E.\n\nHis health to AD ratio is 14 health to 1AD; Cleaver gives him 29 or so bonus AD (bringing it up to about 69AD from 40). Cost wise, its still the same. \nPike does not get oodles of bonus AD, he gets 3.5g worth of AD per 3.5g worth of health. Which is around 7% by the way.  \nMost of the health items he gets will come out to be about the same as similarly priced AD items(cleaver for example is 3000g for 69 AD; only 14AD more than duskblade which is 55AD). \n\nAnyway, his ult numbers do need some changes. His maximum should be 300 or so, and his scaling should be around 0.8 bAD; As it is, it DOES have very high numbers.

He was a much higher level than their team... his ult scales off levels, and levels are something that is usually in short supply for a support champion.\n3.  This is PBE.  If the player was playing  against people at his own level, I doubt he would be this ahead in a lane match up due to the lack of damage in the rest of his kit.\n4.

They will nerf his ult enough and it will be useless because it's the most feast or famine ability ever conceived.\n\nOnce it's nerfed enough to be not OP it will be useless.
