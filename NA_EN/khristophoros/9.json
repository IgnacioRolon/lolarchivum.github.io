The old system clearly wasn&#039;t working.\r\n\r\nNow that I&#039;ve tried the new system I&#039;ve come to realize it&#039;s a terrible concept. Why? Because 99% of the time, **players don&#039;t stand out.**\r\n\r\nEvery game after the game it&#039;s like &quot;HEY WHO DO YOU WANNA HONOR??&quot;\r\n\r\nAnd I look at the 4 players and I realize that nobody did anything noteworthy. We just played another forgettable game.\r\n\r\nNow that the system is shoving it in my face every game I&#039;ve come to realize it&#039;s totally pointless because usually there is no reason to honor anyone.\r\n\r\nI always wanted an honor badge but now I realize I probably don&#039;t deserve one, nor do most other players.","replies":[{"poster":"nGio","date":"2017-07-03T11:58:00.819+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Player attitudes have improved overall, but it isn't perfect. Played some ARAMs tonight solo, and premades only honored each other. Anyone who wasn't part of the premade would always spam vote whoever initiated the fights, even if the initiation was absolute shit. \n\nI played Morg in one, went 9-3-24, landed almost everything, made a lot of great shield and ult saves, and put down the most damage in a win. No honors, but the Vi who rushed first item Warmogs and used every single ult on the enemy Nautilus got 3. I was just happy to win the game, but playing solo for honor is a pretty uphill battle, regardless of how well you do or how impactful you are.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CrazFight ","date":"2017-07-03T10:29:44.240+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there although I disagree that your totally wrong...\n\nYou don't have to honor anyone u can skip.","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-07-03T10:31:05.703+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think he means the fact how it's just up in your face about honoring every match, like even though you can skip it's like BLAM right in your face","replies":[{"poster":"Khristophoros","date":"2017-07-03T10:53:48.287+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=That Juicy Booty,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=WA09ZOUh,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2017-07-03T10:31:05.703+0000)\n>\n> I think he means the fact how it&#x27;s just up in your face about honoring every match, like even though you can skip it&#x27;s like BLAM right in your face\n\nSorta.

You say that the honor system is pointless when it doesnt seem that \"nobody did anything noteworthy.\" Ok....Then just skip it. Chances are that you will eventually get in a game with someone either carrying your team hard or keeping a cool head, etc. It's like complaining that you have a car that doesnt have gas in it, and then declare that it's pointless to have a car. I doubt that the honor system was made to make players stand out. It was made as a way to show acknowledge and appreciate a teammate's actions in the game and it to me a serves as a nice way to reflect back to previous game and think of any mistakes I've made and what my teammates did to correct them.\n\n Granted, I do think that it's kinda annoying when at every end of the game it brings me to the honor screens when I just want to move to the next game or immediately check out stats.","replies":[{"poster":"Khristophoros","date":"2017-07-03T10:50:48.734+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SyndracateJoker,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=WA09ZOUh,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2017-07-03T10:45:33.319+0000)\n>\n> I dont understand your complaint.
