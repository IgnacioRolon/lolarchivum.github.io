The original Cassiopeia changes really hurt her waveclear, particularly for her W, but also in her Q ratio for early game. However, they were supposed to enable a different farming pattern, which involved poisoning the minions and last hitting them all with E for the mana return. This is not as effective as Q/Wing the wave as Zerath, Ziggs, or old Cassiopeia, but it was intended as a viable means of controlling the minion wave nonetheless. \n\nOf course, it's possible that it simply wasn't functional enough, or maybe it was minimally functional but her other strengths weren't expressing themselves sufficiently to account for her weaker waveclear.\n\nSo, with the upcoming changes, maxing Q first should be much more viable than previously (and thus should be a more accessible waveclear tool), and E will have 0.55 ap ratio at rank 1, so even that should be a better last hitting tool at early ranks. Further, she'll have a flatly more powerful lane presence with the other surrounding changes, which should leave her weaker wave clear as less of a crippling weakness.","replies":[{"poster":"Canastus","date":"2014-11-27T22:47:57.491+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":3,"body":"I don't see how leveling her Q is going to improve her waveclearing if the numbers on it are already bad on their own.

I've experimented with a number of more 'interesting' mechanics as rewards for the breakpoints. Ultimately, they all, much like the current stat-y one, created a feeling in the player of \"but why do I have to wait?\" Basically, when you get a tool that alters the way you approach your core combat pattern, the kit feels incomplete without it. The healing on E is kind of cool and adds some decisions, but none that really change the way you approach combat, except that now you are kind of just stronger.\n\nAs a comparison point, consider Syndra. Her ability augments don't *really* change the way the abilities function. They just sort of add some power (increased damage, increased slow duration, etc.). The one that really stands out to me is the increased cast range on the ultimate. Cast ranges are pretty sacred as far as I've learned. Opponents learn approximately what your threat range is and then play around it, so when that changes things get really whacky. I think it's okay for Syndra since nobody really learns to play around the range of the ultimate, as it only happens once per fight and often within the range of her other abiltites. But when you do this for Noxious Blast or Twin Fang or other abilities that are nearly always up and core parts of a Champion's threat, things start to break down. There are champions who are all-about increasing threat range, like Kog'Maw and Tristana, but that aspect is core to the champion identity, so players learn to play around it.\n\nAs a point of contrast, consider Kha'Zix. His W, E, and R change pretty dramatically when they're evolved. It's pretty important here to nail down the differences between Kha'Zix and Cassiopeia. What is it about Kha'Zix's abilities, which dramatically change his threat ranges and counterplay, that doesn't leave the Kha'Zix player feeling like she's missing something when she doesn't have them? Is it something about the evolution system, or the individual abilities themselves? I think it's pretty clear that it's the evolution system, but what about it? I think a lot of it has to do with it being a core part of the champion's identity, that both kha'zix players and opponents know going into a game that that's his thing. But it doesn't end there. I think the choice there and the reliability is really important. Kha'Zix (and Victor also) can choose to get their preferred upgrade about as early as they can want it. The augmentation of abilities is much more in the hand of the players in these cases (and even to Syndra) and so it doesn't feel like the game is witholding a core ability for them, but rather they get to upgrade their champion *how/when they want to.* That's the prevailing theory anyway.\n\nSo, the question is, what sorts of things make sense to come over game time in ways which you can't control super well? One answer is 'just make it an evolution system like Kha'Zix/Victor,' but I think that design space is starting to get a bit crowded and it's really important that we preserve what makes those champions feel unique. Stats sort of work, but they create a similar feeling of the game playing keep-away with your power. Somehow the Twin Fang augment works, as it's power in a way which adds some softer decisions and doen't really change Cassiopeia's combat pattern. So, if we're going to swap out the stats for more interesting things that feel exciting to get rather than necessary, it would have to fit along these lines.\n\nSorry for the rant, hope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"Kowe The Ewok","date":"2014-11-28T01:08:27.693+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":2,"body":"I've heard - stated by another Riot employee - that Syndra's passive was a mistake to begin with since it feels like she is denied a part of her kit.

Stats sort of work, but they create a similar feeling of the game playing keep-away with your power. Somehow the Twin Fang augment works, as it's power in a way which adds some softer decisions and doen't really change Cassiopeia's combat pattern. So, if we're going to swap out the stats for more interesting things that feel exciting to get rather than necessary, it would have to fit along these lines.\n> \n> Sorry for the rant, hope that helps!\n\nI'm not the most anti-rework person on the boards but with you pointing out how no matter what you try to add as bonuses on the passive it feels unrewarding and frustrating, I'm really left wondering why you actually want the passive? :/ It doesn't sound like you like it yourself at this stage.\n\nI don't feel like random utility stuff like the Twin Fang spell vamp would make it feel like anything was locked away. It'd remind me of the Syndra-esque passives you spoke about, though you're right there'd be less control. But I'm pretty sure as long as her damage was made independent from her passive it would suddenly start to feel fun. I enjoy getting the first break because I have a fun addition to Twin Fang, and I think you should have a bit of faith in similar gains at other breaks (or even at the first one in addition to spell vamp) being fun too. The problem right now is that Cass feels like she needs to desperately try to get her passive to allow her to do damage and it makes a depressing game, but a passive that unlocks cool utility that helps her but isn't essential would remove a lot of pressure from her and make her fun again. The basic problem is that right now when she hits a passive threshold you're like \"phew, one more step down\", whereas in a scenario where all the passive thresholds give utility bonuses that are unrelated to her passive, passing thresholds would be more like \"yay new powers\".\n\nI think until Cass's damage is separated from her passive there'll never be an iteration of it that people like. I've liked your attempts at fixing her, for example the poison amp on E is really inspired and cool, and I'm sure any new passive bonuses will be really cool too. But I think this passive has failed as a way to gate her damage, so ideally her ratios should be buffed again (I still massively support taking advantage of scaling ratios...) until a more effective (but not un-fun) way to make her damage more lategame-oriented appears.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tendrian","date":"2014-11-27T23:53:53.089+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":2,"body":">Sorry for the rant, hope that helps!\n\nIt doesn't, since it still clings to the idea that there is some kind of evolution of power present on Cassiopeia, which means you are still not taking her in the right direction.","replies":[{"poster":"Dominick Destine","date":"2014-11-29T08:46:57.108+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"> >Sorry for the rant, hope that helps!\n> \n> It doesn't, since it still clings to the idea that there is some kind of evolution of power present on Cassiopeia, which means you are still not taking her in the right direction.\n\nThis.\n\nThat long post was just a bunch of waffling.... trying to convince us that the atrocious direction she's been taken is somehow justified (One of the lowest win rates of all champions across all brackets/almost universally despised by  Cass mains = Terrible rework)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Scampy","date":"2014-11-27T23:13:32.341+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":3,"body":"This all assumes Cass has an evolve passive though.

I've experimented with a number of more 'interesting' mechanics as rewards for the breakpoints. Ultimately, they all, much like the current stat-y one, created a feeling in the player of \"but why do I have to wait?\" Basically, when you get a tool that alters the way you approach your core combat pattern, the kit feels incomplete without it. The healing on E is kind of cool and adds some decisions, but none that really change the way you approach combat, except that now you are kind of just stronger.\n> \n> As a comparison point, consider Syndra. Her ability augments don't *really* change the way the abilities function. They just sort of add some power (increased damage, increased slow duration, etc.). The one that really stands out to me is the increased cast range on the ultimate. Cast ranges are pretty sacred as far as I've learned. Opponents learn approximately what your threat range is and then play around it, so when that changes things get really whacky. I think it's okay for Syndra since nobody really learns to play around the range of the ultimate, as it only happens once per fight and often within the range of her other abiltites. But when you do this for Noxious Blast or Twin Fang or other abilities that are nearly always up and core parts of a Champion's threat, things start to break down. There are champions who are all-about increasing threat range, like Kog'Maw and Tristana, but that aspect is core to the champion identity, so players learn to play around it.\n> \n> As a point of contrast, consider Kha'Zix. His W, E, and R change pretty dramatically when they're evolved. It's pretty important here to nail down the differences between Kha'Zix and Cassiopeia. What is it about Kha'Zix's abilities, which dramatically change his threat ranges and counterplay, that doesn't leave the Kha'Zix player feeling like she's missing something when she doesn't have them? Is it something about the evolution system, or the individual abilities themselves? I think it's pretty clear that it's the evolution system, but what about it? I think a lot of it has to do with it being a core part of the champion's identity, that both kha'zix players and opponents know going into a game that that's his thing. But it doesn't end there. I think the choice there and the reliability is really important. Kha'Zix (and Victor also) can choose to get their preferred upgrade about as early as they can want it.

From a lore standpoint, she betrayed Sivir, got bit by a snake trap, and ended up being transformed into a gorgon. Unless she's going Akira on us, she should be at the peak of her potential. \nCassiopeia first and foremost is a spy. Not the kind like her sister, mind you, but a more out in the open spy. She seduces, she deals in secrets, and returns those secrets to her country for the glory of her house. Her new VO is nothing but her talking about how secrets are worth more than gold. So unless she eats secrets like magical wheaties, it makes no sense to have her be focused on being a hyper carry AP mage who ramps up power. She operates from the back lines, spreading venom, lies, poison, and deceit. Therefore, her focus should be her poisons and not her E. Her passive should not be this power gaining stack system, as it does not fit with her characterization at all.\nFirst off, drop Aspect and give her a new, more fitting passive. Maybe something simple like a poison amp aura that increases the damage of her poison the closer she is to the foes. If not that, have it be a conditional buff regarding her poisons. I don't know, but the possibilities are endless and they all can create a fluid ability that isn't what she has now. \nSecondly, if you're concerned with her laning, find a way to give her a weakness that doesn't involve completely crippling her kit if she misses a skillshot. Personally, I thought her extreme lack of mobility and short range in her old kit was a comparable weakness, but hey, clearly I don't know how to balance videogames like you do.\nAnd finally, as everyone else has said before, change the focus on her kit. E was never a focus and should never be a focus. We like Cassiopeia because she is so far one of the rare few mages who expressly deal in . All your rework and dumping all into E does is make her a conditional burst mage. We want DoT (which stands for Damage Over Time), not burst. Again, DoT, not burst. An E-centered Cassiopeia is burst, because her current \"DoT\" is nothing more than a set up for burst. So lose this focus and give the power back to her DoT. DoT has it's counters, on account of it not killing immediately and giving more time to react via potions or life steal, so if you figure out how to balance DoTs and reinfuse her kit with it as a focus, you will have earned our favor.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Serpents Embrace","date":"2014-11-28T01:22:01.087+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":2,"body":"Why **are** you so hung up on considering Kha'Zix and evolution?

I played Cass on and off since her release and while she was always called a hypercarry it just didn't work out that way in practice.
