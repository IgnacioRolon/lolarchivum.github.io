I would love to be able to play the individual parts and possibly take inspiration on my own compositions based off of the beautiful orchestration of every song RIOT has put out. I appreciate any answer of redirection to another thread.

I'm curious what would be more interesting to you (and to anyone else that wants to chime in) - reduced arrangements that consolidate most of the melodies to a single lead instrument part and/or piano, or full scores? The first option might be a more musical playing experience, but the second would really allow you to get \"inside\" the score, so to speak.","replies":[{"poster":"Zedgy","date":"2015-02-03T06:47:40.673+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is both an option? :P\n\nI think I'd prefer a full score, personally, because most of what I want to play are specific sections that I hear played on the violin that sound absolutely gorgeous, and a version that has that specific part would be amazing. At the same time, however, it can be a lot easier to play a tune by yourself with the reduced arrangement? \n\nI dunno, I think I'd prefer a score.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Syllin","date":"2015-02-03T06:37:14.962+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"i personally would LOVE to see full scores of riot music. and not just the orchestral peices. tablature for the the pentakill/vi songs. notation for all the cool keyboard riffs in jinx/lucians stuff. theres a lot of beautiful stuff in the league compositions that it would seem almost insulting to water it down to right and left hand piano scores. theres a LOT going on in some of these songs. layers are important!!!\n\n{{champion:37}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"quazymoodo","date":"2015-02-03T16:08:22.003+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It'd be nice to see a songbook variation for novice/casual instrument players (piano/guitar/simpler notation) as well (beginner-intermediate)... but concert band/orchestral arrangements would be awesome too!
