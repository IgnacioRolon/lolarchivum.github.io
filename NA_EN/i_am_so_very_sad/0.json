I actually have to make this post, I never thought I would see the day where I feel obliged to make this post. This time? Riot pushed it too far. This time was one too many. You really thought I wouldn't make this post? Heh.. Seems I have to. You see it was never my intentions to make this post, in fact if it were up to me I wouldn't make it at all, alas Riot has pushed me one too many times too far. Now I'm forced to make this post. Welp. My cards are on the table all that's left to do is post about it. How many more times Riot? How many more times are you going to delete my posts, forcing me to post about you deleting my posts? Just a thought. Thanks for listening can we get 10 upvotes?","replies":[]}
