{"poster":"Jojobees","date":"2019-01-10T20:21:00.566+0000","title":"Player Behavior Tutorial","subforum":"Player Behavior","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I came up with this idea a while ago when I came across a post from a rioter, stating that one report was just as effective as nine. I had no idea that this was the case, and I have been playing from 2011. I think that if everyone knew that, nobody would ever ask others to &quot;Report Yasuo for AFK&quot;.\n\nMy idea is an in-client tutorial much like the combat training showing you around the punishment system. Outlining what kind of behavior is acceptable, and what isn&#039;t. It would also show what steps are taken if your account is punished, and what you can do if you are wrongly punished. Target it to new players, and I think we&#039;d start seeing an improvement in the community, as well as with false reports.\n\nYou may say this already exists in the summoner&#039;s code, and other tools on the website. But I know that when I created my account, I didn&#039;t log into the website for two or three years after making the account. Also, as the summoner&#039;s code is very broad, it can sometimes be misconstrued, and I&#039;ve seen some Rioters claim something is covered in the summoners code and cite a portion that _vaguely_ resembles what they are talking about. Making this an in-game tutorial would spread awareness and provide a specific baseline for behavior for players to refer to.\n\nEdit: fixed a typo where I had the word 'ban' instead of 'report' Thanks @The_Highest_Noon for pointing that out.\n\nEdit: By in-game I of course mean in-client, not in the actual game while controlling a champion. That would be silly.\n\nEdit: Keep this post alive, I see a lot of votes on the poll who agree with my opinion but not a lot of upvotes on the post itself. If you vote \"Yes! A lot!\" please take the time to hit the up-arrow next to the title of the post.","replies":[{"poster":"Aladoron","date":"2019-01-10T20:33:27.557+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"A tutorial showing how to mute people would be really helpful!\n\nThat way a lot of people would not suffer the unfathomable pain of getting flamed by a total stranger on the internet.

Just like \"fkc yourself\" is not a command, to have coitus with yourself. The same way \"kys\" does not mean \"kill yourself\". And literally everyone knows this. That's why informing people that \"kys\" is a ZT word should be important, because \"kys\" does not encourage self harm anymore. It lost that meaning long ago, and people do not know that Rito does not know this.","replies":[{"poster":"Periscope","date":"2019-01-10T23:20:26.893+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"But there's not really any other meaning for \"kys,\" right?

Then use the same for kys ;) I know you do not mean \"Dear Sir/Madam, please have a sexual intercourse with yourself.\" Because nobody uses it in this context (okay, some weird part of the internet might, but not in LoL). It's the same for \"kys\".\n\nI never said that it's good to say it.\n\nI just say, that \"kys\", \"fck off\", \"fck yourself\" basically means the same in LoL environment. None of them should be said. But arguing that players whish other people's death is simply stupid, because you would not use the same logic in the \"fck yourself\" case, but these things are basically the same.\n\nNone of these should be said, I agree with it. (I think we should allow to say it, but ofc it's better if nobody says it.) But as I said, since \"kys\" doesn't mean \"kill yourself\" in this current situation, people easily put it on the same level as a \"fck you\", which is not ZT. So informing people about this, should be a thing, in my opinion.","replies":[{"poster":"Periscope","date":"2019-01-11T00:11:52.665+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think we're arguing over the meaning of these.

It's because whoever decided to say it intended it to be more offensive than \"I hate you\" or \"go fuck yourself.\"","replies":[{"poster":"Aladoron","date":"2019-01-11T00:23:15.806+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> They aren't the same, as one involves or references suicide, which isn't ok.\n\nThe whole game involves references to horrible things.\nEven one of the announcers said: \"Deserters will be shot!\" when somebody left the game. \n\n> So if you aren't intended it on some level, why say kys? It's because whoever decided to say it intended it to be more offensive than \"I hate you\" or \"go fuck yourself.\"\n\nAnd actually \"kys\" is easier to type than \"fck yourself\", since both mean the same (at least for me), and both are the same \"harsh\" for me. If I ever want to write one, I would write the shorter, the \"kys\". So for me \"kys\" is not more offensive than \"go fuck yourself\".\n\nThe reference to suicide would be a totally valid point in a game, where you have to pet sheeps. Where the lore is a zoo, where all the animals are vegan, and not caged, and play with people.\n\nBut I can respect your opinion, I honestly do not understand it, since in my culture, my usage of words, these are totally the same. Maybe just i'm a horrible person, who knows :D But for me it is trivial that \"kys\" does NOT encourage self harm. OFC, if you give specific tips, how to do it, that is another case. But you have to be totally incredibly straight forward to convince me, that you want my death, and you are not only bantering me.","replies":[{"poster":"Jojobees","date":"2019-01-11T02:34:47.071+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I agree with this guy.

Riot has come out to say that what's punishable under instant feedback is determined by current culture and by extension the playerbase. \"KYS\" and the like have been for years a meaningless taunt not in any way meant to be taken literally, so there's no reason that it should be seen as zero-tolerance since it's not specifically said to instigate self-harm.\n\nAnd before anybody says \"But that's not something that should be said casually\", that's not your decision to make. It's culture. You don't dictate it. Riot can get on a high horse and say they're promoting a \"better, more positive\" environment, but at the end of the game they're punishing citizens for existing in a society and expressing their culture.\n\nAnd then we come back to the idea that Riot should actually consider the circumstances of what's said, but guess what? Riot will never do that, as they've said time and again. \"It sucks, but what you said is what you said and therefor  you should be punished\" despite the fact that what went on isn't punishable when the circumstances are considered.\n\nThe system is broken and needs to be fixed. \n\nIn regards to there being a Behavior Tutorial, I think there should be one.
