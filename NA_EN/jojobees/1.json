This is my story.","subforum":"Player Behavior","up_votes":29,"down_votes":6,"body":"When I made my account, I was just a freshman in high-school, 13 years old, and by all definitions immature and malleable. League of Legends was the first truly competitive game that I have played, and like many other kids my age, I had dreams of going pro.\r\n\r\nI got into ranked, and the community in general was toxic. Calling people out on their mistakes, setting the blame on others, and generally being an ass was the norm. Even when I was playing with my friends, we&#039;d cuss at each other during games and blame each other for losses. In the next game, we&#039;d get over it, wash rinse and repeat. To me, this was normal.\r\n\r\nI played the game on and off for a few years, then got back into it really seriously my first year of college. I think that&#039;s when I got my first warning, a 10-25 game chat restrict (I don&#039;t remember exactly). In game I&#039;d be frustrated at the limited number of messages available, and save them to really unload on someone who I thought really screwed up. Basically I didn&#039;t take the warnings seriously because all of my friends at the time had chat restrictions in the past, but still talked in game the same way.\r\n\r\nMy first ban was on this account and really messed me up, frankly I&#039;m embarrassed about my reaction and my first ticket was titled &quot;I&#039;m a sad, sad person who might kill himself over a permaban, we&#039;ll see&quot;. I was determined to never get another account banned, so I installed an application called AutoHotKey, which can be used to disable your enter key while in League of Legends. But... that didn&#039;t last, and I got a second banned account shortly after.\r\n\r\n-The Second Account \r\nI dropped out of college (for unrelated reasons), and got back into ranked with desperation. I didn&#039;t have a job, and I was convinced that my only hope of &#039;making it&#039; was to get to diamond, start streaming, and eventually go pro. I got into the game with the wrong attitude, however. I was in a rush to rank up quickly, and spent more time getting mad about every loss than I spent trying to improve my own play. Most games I&#039;d wind up disabling AutoHotKey to vent my pent-up frustrations.\r\n\r\nI got the same warnings as on my first account, but I ignored them. I was thinking &quot;if I just get to gold/plat/diamond, people will be more chill and I can focus more on just improving my game&quot;. I was wrong, but you already knew that. The problem is I never changed my attitude towards the game, and although I did rank up, I ranked up painfully slow, and barely improved my own gameplay. My second account was banned shortly after.\r\n\r\n-The Third Account \r\nIt took me a while to actually get to level 30 on my current account, and during the beginning I have to admit I was still toxic. Nothing had really changed.\r\n\r\nUntil everything changed. One day my dad (desperate to get me to do something productive with my life) saw an ad for a new pilot program opening up in town. League wasn&#039;t going my way, so what did I have to lose?\r\n\r\nI quickly lost most of my free time, and with it, most of my skill in the game. I stopped playing as much, and as competitively.\r\n\r\nThen something happened... I got to platinum, higher than I had ever been before. How? I wasn&#039;t playing as competitively, I lost most of my skill, and I had transferred to the support role from mid/top.\r\n\r\nI&#039;ll tell you how. When I stopped playing with that &quot;I need to win&quot; mindset, and started playing for fun, I had been kinder to my teammates, more supportive, more forgiving for others mistakes, because I know I make them too. That loading screen tip about positive players winning more games, I finally realized just how true that was.\r\n\r\n-Conclusion \r\nI won&#039;t lie to you. There have been times where I have found myself slipping back into old habits of toxicity. But those times have become fewer and farther between. It took me almost three years, but I finally realize just how toxic I was. My permaban finally makes sense. I hope my story strikes a chord with many others out there, and maybe it will even help some people make that shift in opinion they so desperately need to avoid a permanent suspension. You don&#039;t want to go down that path, permanent is a hell of a long time.\r\n\r\nI share my story because I wish that before I was banned, I had someone share their story with me. Even though it might not have changed anything. I also share my story to beseech RIOT to give me a second chance. Next time you have an unban experiment, contact me. I guarantee that you will not regret it.","replies":[{"poster":"The Highest Noon","date":"2019-01-10T17:36:58.596+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Man that song made all the difference lmao\n\nSee, this is one of the major issues with the system--it fails to address the problems that already exist in the game which lead to toxicity in the first place. You look at professional players and streamers, they're always shouting and cursing and flaming. You look at in-game chat, people are always cursing and arguing and flaming. And this is what you see as someone getting into the game. Then you're punished. \n\n_What am I being punished for? This is what everyone is doing!_\n\nSo you don't change, because you didn't begin the game thinking that what you did was wrong; it's as normal to you as conversation. \n\n_Everybody else is doing it just fine, right?_\n\n\"But you shouldn't vent in-game. Do it out loud.\" -Riot\n\"Talking with the people involved with your stress is many times more effective and mentally stabalizing than those that aren't.\" -Psychology\n\nBasically, it's the same problem with people report-signalling and asking the enemy team to report others too. They don't know any better, because everyone else is doing it. When I started the game, nobody anywhere said that multiple reports don't actually increase the likelihood of there being punishment. Nobody anywhere said that you shouldn't point out mistakes, no matter how respectful you are. Aside from those issues that aren't addressed anywhere via in-game tooltips or the Summoner's Code, there are many un-mentioned rules of the game that people get punished for, yet I feel that if those issues were directly mentioned then they probably wouldn't be issues. (Say, for example, if there was a report option for \"Asking others to report someone\" then people would stop doing it.)\n\nAll in all, I can really relate with your message. If there was someone around when I first begin to tell me why certain actions would lead to punishment and certain other actions would lead to success, I probably wouldn't have a 6-year old account banned and a second banned half a year later.","replies":[{"poster":"Jojobees","date":"2019-01-10T19:56:24.979+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah. That was pretty much my experience as well. I'm not trying to excuse the toxic behavior, but when I first joined the game in 2011, there was way more toxicity, and way less bans. Punishment escalation would pretty much be an infinite series of longer and longer chat restrictions.\n\nNot sure exactly when that changed, but coming from a community of toxicity it becomes the norm very easily, and that's what makes it such a shock when you actually get permabanned.\n\nReport signalling, too. I saw that for the first time like 3 days ago on a post in this section. Before then I was convinced that 9x reports meant more than 1x report. Part of what I was punished for was calling for reports on other toxic players, or players who were inting. Now that I know 1x report is just as effective there would be no point for report calling.\n\nI feel like there should be a tutorial for new players coming in about the punishment system. Not just \"read the summoners code\" because that requires going to the website and finding it. I didn't even log in on the website until I  had already been playing the game for several years. Make it the same format as the combat tutorials, and outline the code of conduct and what is/isn't okay, as well as how the report system works.\n\nEdit: Actually I think I could make a whole separate thread on how they could implement this kind of tutorial. I'm gonna do that, right now.\nEdit: https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/X2KpcxHg-player-behavior-tutorial","replies":[{"poster":"The Highest Noon","date":"2019-01-10T21:24:00.199+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"rofl yeah, it's not an excuse but the system is insanely broken. It punishes ignorance--and I'm not talking generic \"Oh I didn't know\" but actual \"But your rules don't say it\" ignorance. Not only that, but the system itself seems...archaic? Current crime and punishment systems, the ones that actually work and benefit society, involve not just criminal punishment but crime deterrance. That means, they look at why crimes happen and instead of simply trying to get criminals they just get rid of reasons that crime occurs in the first place, which Riot has not done yet. Toxicity in this game doesn't just happen because of bad people; it happens because of various logical reasons that almost every player has experienced and still does. If Riot would openly discuss with players and address the reasons why toxicity occurs, they'd greatly improve the community's health.","replies":[{"poster":"Jojobees","date":"2019-01-10T21:30:05.796+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"100% agree. I think you might also like the player behavior tutorial idea that I also posted above. Different games have different codes of conduct, League itself has a different punishment ladder than it did in 2011 when I started playing. I didn't even see the summoners code until years after creating my account, and even then it's so vague I think it could do with an upgrade.\n\n(Again, not an excuse. IDK why but I feel like if I don't keep saying this a rioter will come along and say \"Stop making excuses, you were toxic, you got banned.\" And that's not my point at all.)","replies":[{"poster":"The Highest Noon","date":"2019-01-10T21:35:37.345+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"LOL Yeah, that type of dialogue happens from not just Rioters as if the long post about this or that is about making an exuse.

So I am not going to go by emotions on this one. \n\nWhen Riot started doing this experiment, a lot of them failed. They just went back into the habit. \nMost players don't look to redeem themselves, because they honestly believe they're never in the wrong. They normally say they're in the wrong and tries to apologize just to get another chance. They're not here to improve their attitude, to them their attitude is irrelevant and they honestly believe they should be allowed to say whatever they please. That's why I personally always vote against it. \n\nHowever, as for you, you share your own personal story while acknowledging your wrongs. That alone is a good step. A very small small SMALL few handfuls of players actually try to redeem themselves from the past 10 years I've been playing. But not a lot of them have succeeded in doing so. \n\nSo hope you do improve. Keep an eye out for the experiment. \nAlso, keep submitting a ticket instead of posting on the board for another chance. The board doesn't really have the power to change anything on your ban. But I know you're just sharing your story. Good luck. I hope you are one of those few players who can redeem themselves and create a better gaming experience not just for yourself, but for everyone else you play with.","replies":[{"poster":"Jojobees","date":"2019-01-10T04:14:31.069+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm very impressed with all the positive feedback I've been getting on this thread. Thank you for taking the time to read it and I do enjoy reading other opinions on the matter.\n\nAs for people going back to their old habits, or saying whatever they think they should to get a second chance, I've been down that road. I just needed more time. Like I said in the story, this was my first of two accounts to get a permanent suspension. I submitted a ticket a few days after the ban doing just that... Saying what I thought I should to get the account back. It took me almost three years to actually make a change.\n\nI appreciate your optimism on support tickets, but I've submitted around 8, and found that most, if not all, support agents have a copy-pasted message that they just post to anyone with a ban appeal ticket. Anytime I get the same support agent in more than one ticket I find that to be the case. The support system is a bit broken.\n\nAnd on the last point, I already am! I have an account between level 60-70 that I currently play on, and it hasn't had a single warning. Although I don't have as much time to play anymore with my IRL responsibilities, I still make time to play this game. I just enjoy the game. Unfortunately, I didn't have a Reddit account in August of last year, so I didn't see the newest unban trial, but I will keep my eyes out. So I'm hoping against hope that this time it's successful and they allow some other players to participate.\n\nAgain, thank you for the feedback!","replies":[{"poster":"Zombie Gerbil","date":"2019-01-10T07:14:53.153+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Like the most of us on here, we want a more positive gaming experience.\nSo a lot of people on here, average posters come here to try and point out the problems or how they can improve. We just deal with a lot of penalized players who don't care about improving their attitudes but much rather be just unbanned because they don't think they deserve it. Simply disregarding the Rules we all agreed to and just play to make other player's experience miserable because they think they can and enjoy it. \n\nSo I think you just set the right impression for posters like myself who thrives on seeing a better community altogether. A lot of people personally don't like what I have to say because I simply state it how it is and don't sugarcoat it. That triggers toxic players even more regardless of my intention. But you set a good impression by sharing some details on your overall experience and how you look to improve. That's what I love to see. I want to see friendly players or if I can't others will, possibly my friends will. That's my ideal kind of community I want to see more of. \n\nSo you're very welcome and I do sure hope you do get that chance. \nWhen you do and if you do keep that motivation of improving your attitude on that account, you're one of the few.

In reality toxicity in this game is at the same or worse numbers than it began with even though you implemented reward system.\n\nI.   That could be managed by making ban decision based on less positive toxic players. - Simply ban them more often, this way, if they do not reform, they will be stuck in creating new account often, and will not reach high levels or ranked to spread their bile in. \n(this makes the toxic pool stick in low levels so it might annoy actual new players)\n\nII.   Create a separate matchmaking pool(punishment pool, visible or not to the players) that will matchmake players who have a tendency to or are actively toxic. This way toxic players will see their own doing, and non-toxic players will play at peace of mind.\n\nIII.   Make your reward system for being polite, more rewarding. Keys now as it is are not balanced as to the chests received.\n(For me as solo-que player, i get chests for most of my champs pretty fast, and than stop getting chests completely, for some who play only with premades, its vice-versa). So you either have people with too many keys, or people with too many chests. It is not a balanced way of doing things.\n\nIV.   Upgrade the toxicity engine to track AFK players by enemy champion damage done( players are afk by farming forever in jungle, running in circles, they circumvented your filter)\n       And  get a smarter system which will notice words that use space ,dot and numbers in toxic words and names. N3g.ga F4k yo fam K.y.s etc etc ,there are both names, team names, and insults in the game and lobby that have these, and they not being noticed most of the time.\n\nV.   Matchmaking Balancing - How many times has your team in RIFT/ARAM, no matter what mod been matched against a 3/5 to 5/5 premade which completely ruined the game experience.What if.. let us think of a distant chance, Premades were matched against Premades !\nAnd not only that. The player skill which can easily be determined by any number of factors Win-Loss/KDA/S ranks/Teamwork-Honors is not being utilised, AT ALL, so we have Platinum/Diamond players being matched against bronze level players in SO many matches, it is just ridiculous this still happens.  \n    Matchmaking should simply be based on 3 things(Factors, checks) : player toxicity levels, player skill levels, premades.\nThis way you could easily fix MOST of the issues in your game, and players would gladly wait 30-60 more seconds to truly find competetive matches.\n\nVI.   Not toxicity related but worth a mention - If you get info on most often banned champions and you know why are they most banned, Akali exploits, Darius/Pyke/Jax (just some examples) OP/Unbalanced skills, why not rework/balance them, even in slight measures, but untill you no longer have \"META\" sticks on them, that way we would have more competetive matches, and less stomp ones.\nStomp-one sided matches, and Meta picks is what is currently making even main Rift mode, unbalanced no matter the skill of players.\nWell this and the new Burst damage META which makes teamfights end in a second or two, compared to it being actually interesting.\nREAD:LETHALITY\n\nThis was just top of my head, there are people who are probbably paid to think and work about things which i mentioned here, and yet we still have the same issues we had years ago in many of these points.\n\nThank you for helping the community, and hopefully some of these things are looked into, so that both me, and people i know can return to this game.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Jojobees","date":"2019-01-09T21:36:45.978+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yesterday, actually.

My opinion in the matter is it's better to not talk at all than to communicate and be toxic.\n\nIf you can communicate these things without being toxic, than this obviously isn't for you.

My ban at the time was more than deserved, and I'd be too embarrassed to post the chat logs, because I really was toxic.\n\nThe banning system is a bit flawed, but only because their resources are limited to catching toxicity more than any other behavior.

You're playing a highly competitive split second decision team game , with intense focus for 10-30minutes a game and a ranked system.\n\nand your(the community's) problem is \"toxicity??\". Can anyone see the paradox here no? Plz stop propagating the idea that this game can Exist without someone going off at one point or other.\n\nDO , use the mute function , it's 1 click , much easier than making the \"toxicity\" an issue , it is not.There's more negativity generated talking about toxicity than when you get flamed in game.THIS GAME is by design nerve racking. \n\nUltimately YOU fight to KILL other players , do you understand love?\n\nHaving said that if you're going to be toxic be toxic to yourself foremost.\n\nAlso I disagree with the notion that \"having fun mentality\" is better it's just an anecdotal experience that works for you, it ruins 90% of my games , because people just don't want to try.\nI play aram if I want to have \"fun\".","replies":[{"poster":"Jojobees","date":"2019-01-09T22:46:25.283+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"I used to have the same opinion.

The game is more fun when you're winning, after all. I still play ranked, and I am hoping to get back up to plat this season and get that shiny border.\n\nSo, it's certainly possible to have fun while still having a tense game and trying your hardest to win.\n\n\nWhile I agree that at one point or another I likely will get frustrated with the game again and \"Go off\", my account was not banned for going off once or twice.
