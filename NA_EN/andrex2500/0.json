During that time, he can build back up his bar and get skaarl back (who comes in with the passive healthbar).  After the 4 seconds, the item deals [some damage] (guessing 9999 true damage or something similar to urgots ult) that should kill anyone.  However, Kled's passive states that damage taken to the skaarl bar does not roll over to Kled's bar, so Skaarl takes all the damage and Kled dismounts.  Kled still has 1 HP because he was reduced to that at the start of the item trigger.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Inkling Commando","date":"2019-04-15T00:59:27.943+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i never liked GA or MV so i do not know if i want to chance this","replies":[]},{"poster":"VoraciousX","date":"2019-04-15T00:46:30.481+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I remember in the mode where you had the lasers and whatnot, Nemesis?
