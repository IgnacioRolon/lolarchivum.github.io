Here's what I've learned.","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":123,"down_votes":7,"body":"After almost 5 years of playing, I finally hit Master tier. I've learned quite a bit and here are some of the lessons I've learned from playing for so long.\n\n(first sentence or two of each paragraph is the tl;dr for each point)\n\n**Gameplay**\n\nYou know statistics? Throw those out the window. If you can conceptualize and get a good feel for the game, that's going to be 100x more valuable than just knowing statistics, especially once you hit D3. Statistics are only really relevant in low elos when dealing with the most extreme fringe cases (never forget 60% winrate WW preseason 5) or you're trying to find the biggest noobstomper or trying to analyze player behavior. For example, ASol has the highest winrate curve of any champion. It is appropriate to say that he's probably the best one trick champion. It's not appropriate to say, \"This champion has a 47% winrate, thus they're not viable.\" Champions are viable or unviable for many reasons and you can get a feel for them in game.\n\nEveryone makes mistakes. Tons of them. Even in lane there are ways to move properly, places to be to mitigate harass, and options to control the wave/last hit. Challenger players make tons of mistakes in the laning phase. What do you think that's going to say about Silver/Gold players? It's better to minimize mistakes than maximize plays.\n\nIt's better to play with your team than make the correct play. If you know your team shouldn't fight something, but you think you can turn the fight, it's generally better to be there and turn the fight than to say, \"Hopefully they won't engage while I splitpush.\" Generally. There are exceptions to this rule don't try disprove it by saying \"lul Tryndamere\" that shit's obnoxious.\n\nIn low elo, champions counter champions by countering their kit. In high elo, champions counter champions by countering how their kit interacts with minions.\n\nBuilding on the previous point, the biggest trait I see people don't practice is lane manipulation (pushing, shoving, freezing) into macroplay. Having a good knowledge of how your champion should play against the enemy will give you a better feel for the game than practicing the same champ 20 games until you have good reactions and mechanics.\n\nSpeaking of which, I have garbage mechanics. My secret is I look at all the options an enemy has, and think, \"I can do a, b, and c and he can only respond with x and y because z will get him punished. If I take option b he'll use y and so be prepared to counter that.\" It's how you consistently land skillshots, predict flashes, and outmacro your opponents most easily. For example, if I'm playing against Kha'Zix as TF I say, \"as soon as the teamifght breaks out I move toward my team, wait a few seconds, and ult so that Kha'Zix, who is probably invisible and about to jump on them from his flank, gets spotted. Then I cut him off, we get the pick, and we win the fight.\"\n\nBe strong mental. I can't stress how important it is to stay active and take care of yourself. I play 2 games a day, tops. My usual routine is almost not at all until the weekend, during which I splurge. My priorities are food > school > sleep > exercise > League. If you're not in a healthy mindset you're not going to perform as well. Maybe play Fortnite or PUBG after a game that gets you particularly tilted.\n\nSometimes your top laner walks into Cassiopeia at level 1 and instead of admitting fault he says the solution is to buff BC melee champs.\n\nLastly, honestly when I first got on GD years ago I thought, \"Wow these people are so smart and articulate.\" Now I see essentially the same posts and it's a lot easier to see the flaws or gaps in logic. People just aren't as correct or smart as they think they are. Please take what they say with a grain of salt.\n\n**Personal Experience**\n\nNot gonna lie, it's pretty bittering. There comes a point where you see the same people over and over again. While there are some really \"bro\" players out there, there's also some really toxic players who you just don't enjoy being around because they consistently rage, flame, etc. and have no intention of real personal growth.\n\nGenerally, low elo players have 2 ways to act toward you; they want to take you down or put you on a pedestal.\n\nGameplay is pretty guilty of aggressive belligerence. A lot of them seem determined to prove you wrong under any and all circumstances, which seems pretty easy to do when the concepts that high elo players talk about are so abstract they look crazy. It's personally frustrating because I can talk about something like lane priority or, \"you need to back at the 5:30 mark as Viktor\" and people will look at you like you're an alien because they haven't studied up on those concepts or why they're important. So words tend to fall on deaf ears and people shut you out since, \"Zed is permabanned so he must be a good champion.\" which has been going on a couple months now when in reality he wasn't really super good until maybe this patch or the one before (8.9). Again it's about statistics vs. meta/champion feel and it was very easy to scale up vs. Zed and play safe until you could afk waveclear, and that's what made him a bad champion. See what I said earlier about countering champions vs. countering minion interactions.\n\nOh, and don't forget the people on Boards who post, \"screw high elo. 90% of the playerbase is below plat. Balance around us.\" I played hard to get here and I put in a lot more effort than most people. It's not fair to guys like me, scarra, qtpie, etc. who put in more effort to learning the game if you completely ignore how far we've come. Ya know?\n\nSame thing in normal games. I play almost only ranked now because if you play normals, the games are super low quality. You get 1v3 camped, people base their entire strategy around taking you down instead of playing the game out right and when I want to learn new champions it doesn't help I have an almost unrealistic situation where I've got a ton of people ganking me every 20-30 seconds. Like I said, determined to take you down under all circumstances. It's not fun.\n\nBlind admiration seems like a perk but it just gets obnoxious. I really just want to play video and hang out with friends or enjoyable people who also enjoy the game. The problem is a lot of your lower elo friends start looking at you kinda differently. I had one guy consistently pressure me to play ranked games with him on a smurf because he wanted free wins. You also get a bunch of people who just add you for attention, validation, or help grinding ranked (it's significantly worse if you're a streamer). You get a lot of players that are just super inconsiderate and treat you like a commodity. Yes, that includes e-girls (of which I've got none. Gotta be a recognized face first).\n\nSo yeah, that's pretty much the full experience. Overall as a gaming experience, it's pretty good. I'd say if you want a satisfying League experience definitely go for the top. People still goon quite a bit it's just not as pronounced.\n\nIn terms of player interaction, it can be a bit obnoxious. If you take anything away from this, it's that we're people too we just put too much of our free time into a game. Don't act like we're aliens. We get enough of that from families when we leave our room for the first time that week.","replies":[{"poster":"Full AP Jesus","date":"2018-05-03T17:22:30.443+0000","up_votes":48,"down_votes":0,"body":"Carry me to Bronze 4","replies":[{"poster":"ninjaroxas","date":"2018-05-03T21:23:47.411+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you tried building Jesus full ad instead?","replies":[{"poster":"Melledoneus","date":"2018-05-04T21:04:00.641+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I tried that build.\n\nNeedless to say it will never cross my mind again.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"426287","date":"2018-05-03T22:50:23.173+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":20,"body":"You lost me when you put yourself into the same category as qtpie scarra etc. Really?

(I.e it feels more like you win or lose because of skill difference, not who has the one worst player)\n\n\nI will give u my honest opinion since alot of Players just pretend to be diamond or ever being there, and give you false answers or hopes. first, i have to mention that my peak elo was D2 <- Alright. So to answer your question now.\nHigh Elo is more one sided than low Elo by far. The reason for that is, it doesn't matter if in higher Elo players die less, Players are far better of knowing their Champs Limitation and snowball Limits. A diamond Player that get's a pre lv 6 kill at midlane can absolute dominate the entire lane and zone you from the entire Minion wave if he has the correct champ to do so. You will never see or experience this iN low elo. No matter how often you die, Players won't zone you away from the exp range and they won't crush you. I was in Low elo and i got 3-4 kills sometimes in like just 6minutes. Yet when i get just a single Kill pre 6 currently (d3) sometimes i can completely crush my enemy, and build up double cs and 2-3 level advantage, making him completely useless. \nAlso once a team is behind, enemys will pressure their lead at all costs, they are gonna clear your wards all time long and try to build their own vision up, taking all objectives asap, and ending the games on average of 22-23 minutes. In low Elo the average game time is around 27-30Minutes. That are an extra 7 Minutes. And while there are onesided Low elo games, in most of them even if you have a feeding top, even if the enemy team is 20Kills ahead, they do not know how to close out proberly if you counteract their acts. They are extremely scared to towerdive you, they are extremely scared to start Barons, and they are extremely scared to go deep fearing of throwing their lead away. That's why Low elo is not even close to being onesided as in High elo. It might look more onesided \"stats wise\" but in the end those stats simply are just a delusion.\nOne of the reason why challenger smurf diamond smurfs can just simply win everything in low elo is because they can stall the game with little effort due to makro play, simply splitpushing the enemys makes them feel like they have to answer and waste their entire time to try and get you, I climbed to plat 4 with around 70% wr and didnt even try that hard, i played for fun mostly, and i wasn't even snowballing of due to mechanics, i simply stalled the game and won it later by catching peoples out of Position","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Risen29","date":"2018-05-04T04:51:24.161+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What would you say is the thing you learned that separates a D1 player from a masters player?","replies":[{"poster":"Rins Thigh Socks","date":"2018-05-04T04:57:28.682+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Risen29,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=qrE3N2ti,comment-id=0026,timestamp=2018-05-04T04:51:24.161+0000)\n>\n> What would you say is the thing you learned that separates a D1 player from a masters player?\n\nAlmost nothing.

Ya know?\n\nwhen people say \"stop balancing around diamond +\n\nthey are talking about riot blatantly ignoring the lower elos like flat out deleting trackers knife, which is an absolute MUST in lower elo because you CANNOT rely on your team to ward.\n\ni played one game on pbe earlier today.. it got cut short becuase pbe was taken down.. but i cant not remember that last time i had that much fun..\n\nbecause for the first time i had a team they knew how to play.\n\ni am tried of people saying \"your silver your a noob\"  i have been playing for 5 years, i know more about this game than i would wager most plats.\n\nbut its too damn stressful to try to climb, becuase no matter how mnay fucking time i ping something. i get fresh lvl thirties or complete idoits on my team who dont know how to play.\n\ni CANNOT remeber the last time i had a team that did not have at last TWO mindlessly feeding players.. sure the other team has them as well. \n\nhigh elo and lower elo are a completly different playstype becuase THESE PEOPLE CANT PLAY.\nand riot cant just flat out REMOVE things that us lower players NEED in order to try to mitigate the absolute madness down here.\n\nits quite often painful to watch what goes on down in my elo.. but the fact is.. i i dont PLAY champs that can carry lower elo. and and am NEVER going to.\n\nso i will ALWAYS be stuck with these morons.\nit donest matter if i have 15 kills. i can pounce into 1v5, i can't solo defend a turrent\n\nthe champs i play NEED a team... there IS no such thing as \"teamwork\" down here.\n\ni can only recall losing to a better opponent ONCE in the past 3 years.. once that actually outplayed me.\n\nits always. oh great... im nidalee  with 7 kills but thier{{champion:77}}   has 6  kills.. and there isn't jack shit i can do to stop him... because he freaking hardcounters me.\n\ni swear i seroiuly wish i could play on higher elo so i can have an actaul CHALLENGE from the opposing PLAYER. and not just loseing becuase my teammates mindlessly feed.\n\nand whats worse is i am FORCED to make STUPID plays i dont want to do becuase they are our last chance of salvaging there game.\n\ni mean.. if its a 20% chance to win the teamfight but if i dont take it we lose the nexus... i have to take it... there is no \"trying to preserve kda\"\nyou go and and hope for the best.\n\nwhen my team dives in 4v5 i HAVE to fucking follow them.. even if its a horrible idea... becuase if we lose the fight... i CAN'T stop them from ending the game..\n\nidk im annoyed with riot right now....\nbloody fucking ADC changes are supposed to be NERFS and they not only break assasins but are going to break every other damn thing as well\n\nhail of blades... new IE, Stormchaser.\nsupport lvl exp for junglers\n\ni mean sure i got the amazing new {{item:1039}}  i wanted... but fuck i wont even be able to play with it if they release that other shit...","replies":[{"poster":"Son Foku","date":"2018-05-04T01:37:01.703+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"i belung in cahllenjer but mah TEAM!!!!!!","replies":[{"poster":"SwiftKitten88","date":"2018-05-04T03:41:20.193+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Son Foku,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=qrE3N2ti,comment-id=001a0000,timestamp=2018-05-04T01:37:01.703+0000)\n>\n> i belung in cahllenjer but mah TEAM!!!!!!\n\nlol.. i am under no delusion of where i belong... i may have the _game knowledge_ of a diamond or even master sure.. after over 5 years of player i should, but knowing _what_ to do is a far cry from being able to actually DO it.\n\nI've played for 5 years.. my mechanical skills arn't getting any better, infact.. they are getting worse because i an now nearly in my thirties.\n\nif i was elevated to plat.. i could pretty easily hold that rank, but with the champs i play.. climbing there is out of the question unless i quit my job. like i said.. it done'st matter if i am 20 kills up as a  {{champion:76}} .. if they group as 5... i cant stop them alone...  not unless they all have 10-20% hp...\n\ni have gone on a 16 game win streak to climb out of bronze last season, thats easy enough.\n\nbut even last game, i had to support a {{champion:67}} who i don't think has ever played the champ  before..\n\nthe game before that? i had a vayne who COULD play\n\n\nwant to see the difference?\nhttps://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/2776112923/207008136?tab=overview\n\nthis game my adc can play and i can easily get her fed... and she got about 95% of the kills i set up for her\n\nhttps://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/2776146695/207008136?tab=overview\nthis game...\nmy adc has major mental issues\n\nnot only died a bunch...

You just don’t, game knowledge includes everything from knowing when to actually gank/farm, when to take objectives, how to play the macro game overall, every champion matchup and how everything interacts together. You have the game knowledge of a silver. Because you are silver. Game knowledge alone can take you very far.\n\n\n\n> I&#x27;ve played for 5 years.. my mechanical skills arn&#x27;t getting any better, infact.. they are getting worse because i an now nearly in my thirties.\n\nI’m 31 and can react just as fast as an 18 year old. If you’re brain isn’t functioning as well it’s because you aren’t healthy. When you’re 18 you have that great reaction time because you’re still growing (I mean I’ve fallen down stairs and got up and walked off at 18, couldn’t do that now). When you’re 30 you can have the same mental health but you need to actively work for it by leading a healthy lifestyle.\n\n\n> if i was elevated to plat.. i could pretty easily hold that rank, but with the champs i play.. climbing there is out of the question unless i quit my job. like i said.. it done&#x27;st matter if i am 20 kills up as a  {{champion:76}} .. if they group as 5... i cant stop them alone...  not unless they all have 10-20% hp...\n\nNo you couldn’t, your match history shows you can barely hold your own where you’re at. And bad news, plat players still do tons of dumb shit.

You have better mechanics and game knowledge.\n\nIf you’re stuck in Silver, it’s because you are at a silver level of mechanics and game knowledge.\n\nI know it sucks to come to the realization tha after 5 years, you’re still not good enough to hit Gold league or anything above it, but the sooner you realize it’s your fault, the sooner you’ll climb. You’ll never learn anything if you keep thinking you’re better than everyone else.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"sobi999","date":"2018-05-07T11:56:06.490+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like the way you presented your opinion but i think you stereotype low elos way too much. Like for example, \" Generally, low elo players have 2 ways to act toward you; they want to take you down or put you on a pedestal \".  Don't forget, you were once low elo and its not correct to say that once you reach higher elo's, all of your bad traits disappear. My point being, not all low elo players are bad in every  possible way. They might just be inexperienced in the game so lack the mechanics but are generally good at decision making or they might have great mechanics but lack the decision making that they could only gain from experience.  In other words, they are not low elos because they are toxic/garbage at the game, but they need some time to improve, just like all of us do. My asian friends keeps telling me that, the reason we are better than you is because we play a lot more than you. The amount of time you play is directly proportional to how well you perform but obviously some players are still stuck in bronze even after many years of gameplay. Its interesting that out of my 2 years of gameplay i have only played 4-5 ranked matches. I play when i am free and bored, so i don't have the mindset of climbing but i usually spectate and can see that silver/gold players are actually worse than me. I never really thought about improving my myself at the game but the more i play the better i can see i become. I have hideous mechanics but i have absurdly good predictions so i can generally tell what the enemy will do, where it will be on map and most importantly when they will do baron/dragon. However, i always find myself pinging and telling my team mates but they never listen and i am glad i don't play in ranked because otherwise i would be stressed out.

He is articulate and insists he could easily be plat if he played more. Being articulate is fantastic and all but when you're wrong no amount of articulation is going to save you from being wrong. You have to prove yourself and no amount of insistence otherwise is going to be of any help without solid evidence.\n\nAlso, I find it extremely funny that we've come full circle.
