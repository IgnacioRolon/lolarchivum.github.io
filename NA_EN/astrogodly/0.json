The thing is that i got them from Amazon.com so it was like a digital code so theres obviously no receipt for it, but i do have pictures of my purchase. In conclusion i bought two 10$ gift cards and neither of them will work. I would appreciate it if this could get resolved really soon. I will provide picture evidence of my purchase so you can see this is a big problem. Thank you for you're time riot games. {{champion:157}} _","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-08-16T18:30:21.661+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rest easy, our billing team can look into this with you.
