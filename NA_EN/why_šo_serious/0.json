But I kind disappoint of the ULT animation. It&#039;s the same as bard&#039;s other skin. Here is my idea: Instead of &quot;Zhonya&quot; your enemy champions, snowday bard&#039;s Ult turns enemy champions into BLUEISH  PENGUINS :D . Like when you get into his magical journey you transfer into a Penguin.  That will make it a perfect skin.  {{summoner:32}}","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-12-15T00:20:27.040+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey why šo serious,\n\nIn regards to the ult, it's kept consistent throughout all of the skins for gameplay clarity.","replies":[{"poster":"why šo serious","date":"2015-12-15T22:39:43.769+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"LOL I noticed that, I wasn't think about that.
