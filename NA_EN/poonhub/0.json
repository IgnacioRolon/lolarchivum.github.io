Might have to use Debug Mode to set the clocks to standards. Try that in the Nvidia Control Panel if u have an nvidia card. Should run stable for awhile, just depends on the games.\n\nGood luck!\n\nP.S - I have an GTX 970 FTW, sometimes it runs well without the debug mode, but for stability reasons give it a try.","replies":[]}]}]}
