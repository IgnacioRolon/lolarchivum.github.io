She is supposed to have a quote for starting the game e.g &quot;Slogan! Catchphrase! Tagline!&quot; (which is really funny) But I have heard NONE of these quotes, she just sticks to her normal movement lines. Could someone at Riot check this out, It would be a pity to lose those lines cause of some bug.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-11-18T17:29:13.497+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Rinark - \n\nAs a heads up, the League Wiki isn't something that we (Riot) run, and is third party, so all information may not be 100% correct. We do have lines in the game (files) that aren't actually used. \n\nIn this case, I'm not certain is this line should/shouldn't be playing. I've messaged the audio engineer who worked on her to see if this line is meant to play or not. *I'm curious if it was meant to be in the game, it was overwritten by the Star Guardian music being added to the champions, as opposed to the minions so it'd play forever.* I'll follow up today and edit this post when I have some definite answers.\n\n**EDIT:** This should now be in and working (should see it for 6.24). If you aren't seeing it by then, please let me know!
