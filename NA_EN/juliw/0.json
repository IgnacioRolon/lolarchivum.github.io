A quick update: as previously announced, loot and clubs will hit the alpha during this patch. Loot works pretty much exactly like it did in the legacy client, but we've rethought club functionality and given it its own tab in the Social tab's sub-nav.","url":"http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/features/now-testing-loot-and-clubs","image":"https://am-a.akamaihd.net/image?f=https://news-a.akamaihd.net/public/images/articles/LCU/2016/september/619-context/EN_ClubsLanding.JPG"},"up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm in the alpha client and I wanted to ask about something, but when I tried to click on the \"create a discussion\" for the alpha discussion it stated \"Must be level 12 or higher. The thing is I signed in to the league of legends website and my alpha client with my level 30, sliver 2 account. So why can't I create a discussion? \r\n\r\nIf you wouldn't mind answering my alpha question (I'll type this just in case you'll be able to answer it); \r\n\r\nSo the link provided stated that \"We've also delayed the ability to purchase RP in the store. Otherwise, the store works fine, but you'll need to use the legacy client to stock up on our fake internet money.\" I was wondering where can I get the fake internet money? Thing is I don't know what the legacy client is, so what is it? Does fake internet money mean free RP? Also, does using my sliver 2 account effect anything with getting the fake internet money? Do I need to create a new account to get the free internet money?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-22T17:42:41.058+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"*Fake internet money* was more of a joke that's been around on the net for a long time. RP stands for Riot Points, which is a currency used to purchase skins, champions, ward skins, and other account services and digital goods within the store in the client. RP can be purchased with real money and be used towards purchasing those items in the store.\n\nThe *legacy client* is the normal one you played League on before getting accepted into the Alpha Client. Basically the messaging was just letting testers know that if they want to stock up on RP, they'll have to do so in the current Live (legacy) client before heading back into the Alpha Client to make purchases.\n\nI hope that cleared this up. Let me know if you have any questions.\n\nP.S. Your level on the boards has been updated, so you should have no issues posting on the boards anymore.","replies":[]}]}
