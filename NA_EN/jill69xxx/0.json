Then I try to buy a 450 champion and it says my IP balance will be 593 IP which means it isn't registering about 300 of my IP. I know I have the proper amount of IP because the last thing I bought was a 2050 IP Life % Quintessence rune and my balance was like 10 IP afterwards. It also won't let me switch back to the legacy client on either of my 2 computers. What do I do?","replies":[{"poster":"Goosenutinurface","date":"2016-12-06T21:46:50.824+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I AM HAVING THE SAME ISSUE AND SUBMITTED A TICKET","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-05T04:36:44.075+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a new issue that popped up after the store outage last week.
