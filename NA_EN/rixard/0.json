I haven't done anything that could be called \"toxic\" and in my past 20 games I've actually been honored quite a few times. So no recent history or any history of my past games have I done anything to break the guidelines that would result in a ban. I was logging into today and without and type of warning I was banned permanently. It said I would receive an e-mail as to why I was banned but I was not sent an e-mail. So I was wondering could you help me fix this or inform me why I was banned and how I caused it?  I haven't done anything that I recall that would result in a permanent ban, especially one without warning.","replies":[{"poster":"HeyItzSteve","date":"2017-09-26T02:12:39.081+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You should send a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us) and ask why you were banned.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-26T04:28:21.814+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There was some suspicious activity going on with the account that might have been signs that it was compromised.
