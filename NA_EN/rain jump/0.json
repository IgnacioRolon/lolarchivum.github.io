For example, you can place the rectangle so that a champion is inside it clearly but wont show up on your actual screen. \r\nThe cause of this is that the rectangle is a depiction of a top-down view where in league of legends you are actually viewing the map from an angle.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how to attach pictures so I just linked it from the last time I posted\r\nNotice how in the pictures Katarina, even though on the minimap she is supposed to appear on your own screen, is clearly not in view or covered up by a piece of the HUD\r\n\r\nIn order to fix this the rectangle needs to be changed to more of a trapezoid that widens out the farther up the screen you are and narrows towards the bottom, as you always view from that \"blue side\" angle\r\n\r\n \r\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/attachments/token/XTjhOjLQjK5AnlflZQyosYoNM/?name=League+of+Legends+2014-07-31+16-03-58-615.jpg\r\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/attachments/token/OPUOuo8LyCFHSoVIGpIPzStLq/?name=League+of+Legends+2014-07-31+16-04-05-317.jpg\r\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/attachments/token/Vc1mIb74C9EAtsJomOf41DK3Q/?name=League+of+Legends+2014-07-31+16-04-13-398.jpg\r\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/attachments/token/YT7yKcYx5acpHJSOGTce03PPU/?name=League+of+Legends+2014-07-31+16-04-17-526.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Wittrock","date":"2015-01-23T03:06:53.066+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Interesting feedback, and good catch.
