These take a moderate amount of time to be decent very high skill ceiling especially on grag and fiddle.\nShaco would be a champion that would take the biggest time investment, but if you like his chaotic style he's the most diverse champion in the game by far. We're talking hundreds of games out of which you'll most likely feed or be useless for half of them while you're learning (if you play vs. people near your skill lvl)","replies":[]},{"poster":"z63XnLCMwX","date":"2015-04-05T00:40:55.448+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Junglers are supposed to have map presence, even when they're not there so the enemy team must be careful not to be too aggressive giving your team breathing room.

Personally, I'm a farm heavy and gank occasionally jungler, so champions like Nocturne and Shyvana suit me well, that being said, my two best champions are Evelynn and Rammus since you can farm so fast and gank quickly afterwards.\n\nYou need to develop a style before you can really nail what jungler it is you want to play as since there are so many different ways to play in the jungle. Yes Sejuani and Amumu both have highest win rate, but if they don't suit your style, you may not find as much success with them as their win rate shows. \n\nIf you're not sure, I would start with a generalist jungler, Lee Sin being the best one to chose, since he can do everything relatively well, but isn't necessarily the best at any one thing. \n\nOnce you've figured out your niche for how you jungle, than you can look at those junglers.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheRakkun","date":"2015-04-04T23:18:02.563+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sejuani and Amumu are the best ATM but you can go far with jungling someone like Volibear, after all this is the Tank meta.
