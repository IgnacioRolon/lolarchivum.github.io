Well I&#039;ve experienced that just recently and it PISSES (clearly I&#039;m tilted) me off that I got demoted by one... and the rest of my team gave up like, that was it. We need an upgrade on matchmaking or something, because I don&#039;t want others (including myself) losing LP in ranks because of these people, even worse is getting demoted by trollers, which at this point you&#039;d rather play with salty teammates.\r\n\r\nI had to experience mine while I was at the edge of Silver 3, match was found and our teammate started stating how _LP is so important_ then started feeding every single enemy in the first 2-3 minutes. The troller then started saying:\r\n- &quot;If you don&#039;t have the skills, don&#039;t play ranks&quot;\r\n- &quot;As a player with no skill, you are just wasting your time and everyone else&#039;&quot;\r\nThen my own teammates started calling me toxic and salty (cuz clearly I feel robbed), and I just couldn&#039;t do anything\r\n\r\nConclusion, I need a way to leave the game without losing LP and not get LPQ OR kick out teammates that are trollers, because that is the most horrible way of putting you down after you worked your butt off in this game.

I don't really care if they dont give me my LP, I want a better matchmaking because I want to play with players who where chill with playing. Kind of like karma, if you do good you get to play with good players (not in skills but in attitudes).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Zero Shingetsu","date":"2017-08-29T21:28:17.686+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's almost impossible to keep trolls from trolling, unfortunately. The only thing they might do is evaluate trolling reports in ranked differently, with punishments including set duration bans on ranked play. IE \"You must play 10 normal games before you play ranked again.\" That'd probably just mean more trolling in normals, though, so it's not a perfect fix. \"10 AI games\" maybe?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Roaming Noman","date":"2017-08-29T20:16:43.530+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But no, its very unlikely riot will add anything to help with the l.p. loss.","replies":[]}]}
