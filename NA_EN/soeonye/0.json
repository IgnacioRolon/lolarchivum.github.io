I've been told the icon lost its rainbow border due to some slip-up, but it should be fixed soon!","replies":[{"poster":"Scorpius","date":"2017-09-25T09:25:23.441+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know this topic is a tad bit old, but is there any news about this? They changed the icon again but now it has a rainbow background instead of what it originally looked like. Why? The original background complimented the Poro very well because of its darker color. The Poro stood out, which it should be as it's the main point of the icon. Instead it now has a bright rainbow background that pulls all attention away from the Poro. To be entirely honest and blunt, it's somewhat of an eyesore now. Is there any news about them going to keep it this way? As the icon is what convinced me to buy the Master Dungeon Key. If I knew it was going to be the one with the rainbow background from the start, I wouldn't have bought it and just gotten the Mini Dungeon Key instead. Seems a bit unprofessional to change a product within a months time of people buying it. It had become one of my favorites too. Now I just get sad whenever I see it.","replies":[{"poster":"starrydrop","date":"2017-09-27T18:59:13.679+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hope they bring back the old icon. :(","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Kokua","date":"2017-09-03T03:14:56.250+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I too very much prefer the way it used to look.
