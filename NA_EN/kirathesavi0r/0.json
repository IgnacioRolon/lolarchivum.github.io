I did some looking around and it seems like the skin is retired legacy content.  I have more than enough essence to activate it, but when I go to do so, my only options are to reroll or disenchant it.  My question is, will it ever come back around so I can activate it?  Or is this shard just useless to me?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-21T20:34:25.974+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Annie in Wonderland is a legacy skin! You're pretty lucky to get one of those!\n\nAs it turns out, the reason you can't activate that skin shard is because you already own that skin! Check for Annie in Wonderland in your collection and you should see her there ^_^.","replies":[]}]}
