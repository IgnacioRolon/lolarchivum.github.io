(Riot, please don't!)","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":16,"down_votes":5,"body":"As playing Illaoi quite frequently and often, I was already discouraged from playing her due to the E changes that were supposed to be &quot;buffs&quot;? but really just made her laning phase even less bully like, and really offered nothing as far as team fighting goes, because it allows the character that got the debuff to hop back in after 12 seconds, but now they are changing her healing per tentacle (5%) to a static 15% once every 20 seconds? How is that supposed to help her during team fighting? She&#039;s hardly picked now as it is.\n\nAt this rate, we might as well pick Darius. He offers some light cc, better team fighting because he&#039;s allowed to move as he stacks, better healing because it also stacks ( Up to 36%, let&#039;s talk about this. ) and offers an all around better stats. \n\nI&#039;d like whatever Riot is smoking, because this is the wrong direction for Illaoi. If anything her tentacle speed should be moved up so the tentacles actually hit their target once in a while, and change the static healing. ( Like why would you even do that to her, who&#039;s hardly played at a measly 2.18%, while Darius is played at an 8.27% rate and sports more than 5x the ban rate ) &lt;- Sources from Champion.gg\n\nPlease reconsider these changes and actually buff her! She&#039;s sitting at a 44.55% win rate! That&#039;s horrendous compared to other lane bullies! Thank you.\n\nEDIT : Not sure why I'm getting downvoted, some discussion would be nice...","replies":[{"poster":"5050BS","date":"2016-05-09T23:54:43.674+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"They nerfed her Multi-tentacle damage too without noting it in the patch.\n\nFirst tentacle is 100%, then 50% for the next and 25% for all others.\n\nSo again why even have this champ if they are not going to fix her.\n\nOnly people that lose to her are those that dont know how to play vs her or are stoned/drunk","replies":[]},{"poster":"TTK Dreadnought","date":"2016-05-09T21:52:09.861+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Completely agree here.

She needs faster animations and the healing was fine.

Now we can max E second without wanting to put points in W just to lower the CD.\n\nThe changes to her heal are strange. It CAN be a good change when you consider just her harass in lane. Instead of hitting Q three times, you just hit one Q for the same healing, that's good. But what about her ultimate? \n\nEveryone knows that Illaoi survive the fights by using her ultimate to heal herself while the tentacles smash the opponents to death. Now she wont be able to do that because the healing CD early is 20 sec. Even late game she will be able to heal only twice during her ultimate.\n\nI don't know what Riot has in mind with this change, but i hope they realize this change can break the champion completely and make her 100% unviable if they don't have changes planned with this.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TallyZrg","date":"2016-05-09T23:51:47.819+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Meddler confirmed that they are reverting the change to her Q.

They already nerfed her damage. even if its experimenting its an OBVIOUS nerf on her survivability on top of a damage nerf that was not even necessary a patch or two ago. they were supposed to be buffing her. non of these are buffs so far","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ast√¥lfo","date":"2016-05-09T22:00:55.485+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Another example of the balance team being completely braindead.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Evewynn","date":"2016-05-09T22:29:48.899+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm pretty sure it goes down to 4 seconds between healing at max rank.
