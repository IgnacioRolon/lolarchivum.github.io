We want blood!\" Riot doesn't tell you the actions they take against players for this very reason. They likely received multiple leaver buster penalties which, if they continue, will result in a 14day and then a perma. This has happened to a friend of mine, so I've seen first hand that they do get punished at about the same pace as someone who is punished for chat.\n\nWhen a Rioter finds someone who continually AFKs intentionally via a manual review, I can assure they are given more than a LPQ regardless of whether it's their first punishment or not.\n\nThe issue I think that you and a lot of other players are having is that you (understandably) believe that players who exhibit negative behavioral patterns in game do not get punished at the same rate as players who exhibit negative behavior in chat. This isn't necessarily the case. Once again, it's more so because people who AFK aren't repeat offenders as often as people who are toxic in chat. You can post examples of 1-in-a-million cases all you want, but it will not change that fact. Even in the chat ban threads, you will see people who say stuff like \"This is all you got banned for? I say way worse and have never gotten a penalty at all.\" I say that to say that there will be a few snowflake cases who slip through for longer than they should, but that happens to every category, not just trolls. It's about consistency.\n\n\"I still have AFKs in my games.\" Well you also still see people who are highly toxic in  chat in your games as well, even if no one is actually trolling. If the system punished people as aggressively and with as much bias towards as you believed, wouldn't they be gone as well?\n\nThe top comment in the thread you linked had 3 accounts banned for the behavior, so even in the evidence you gave, there's proof that AFKs/ints do get punished. When special cases that slip through the system like that occur, best you can do is bring it to Riot's attention for a manual review just as you did. With as many Rioters that play the games and frequent the forums, it's next to impossible for them to not see it even if it takes a minute to reach the right ears. They still monitor the LeaverBuster system for accuracy, and they're still working to improve it to be able to catch the few cases that slip through.\n\n(And no, Im not the one who downvoted you)","replies":[{"poster":"vOmvbrawfU","date":"2017-03-04T19:24:14.289+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In your opinion, how many games of intentionally going AFK warrants punishment?","replies":[{"poster":"Roaranor","date":"2017-03-04T23:05:03.664+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What level of punishment are we talking, and how inclusive are you wanting to be with the scenarios?\n\nPersonally, I'm fine with punishment starting on the first offense and going LPQ, bigger LPQ, 14-day, perma. \n\nI'd like to see them attack people who intentionally AFK or int more aggressively (including the time frame and # of offenses it takes to flag someone for review), but I guess I can understand why they don't. Firstly, there's not much of a difference between someone d/c'ing and someone legitimately going AFK from the server side. You could try and draw discrepancies, but then AFKers would just adjust their tactics to simulate an accidental or unpreventable d/c. \n\nThen there are players who will falsely report behavior just for the sake of it or to feel better about the loss, rather than only reporting legitimate cases. \"Report X for int\" when in reality they just had a bad game, or \"Report Y for afk\" when it was just a 5 minute d/c due to their ISP. But how can a server know these things? Hell, I've seen a Yasuo that was doing worse than anyone on team /all telling the enemy to report someone else for inting just because they kinda sorta halfway  lost lane.\n\nSo I want them to be more aggressive about their punishments in every category (including inappropriate names because I've seen some pretty abhorrent ones slide by for as long as I cared to check), but at the same time I can't in good conscience want people who just had unfortunate circumstances get punished to that same degree.\n\nWhat I want more than anything is an intersectional approach towards punishments. If someone rage quits one game and then flames in another, I want that to count as two offenses on a single system, rather than a single offense on two systems.

No one says \"gg ez\" after a football game and no one says \"my team sucks\" when they lose in baseball.  People have a lot more respect in real life, but not only that, saying something like that in a video game is almost never taken seriously.  \n\nCompetitive esports of course is the middle ground, and punishing someone for using slurs makes sense since its a sometimes broadcasted and widely viewed form of media.  Also, no one will flame their teammates in competitive because they are teammates, they know each other, and their opponents most likely. It is a very different situation when you're playing solo queue in League and someone you don't know calls you out on a mistake that you admitted to and insults you and you retaliate. \n\nSure i'd say repeated use of homophobic slurs could earn someone a chat ban or a short suspension, but I think general toxicity has no place to be punished, maybe you could inform a player that others have reported them and provide the chat logs.  \nWorst case, I'd say should be a chat ban if someone is genuinely insulting someone based on something they know about them. \n\nI don't think it's riot's responsibility to be moderating this. What if youtube deleted every comment that was toxic or rude towards producers (i think they do moderate hate speech toward creators and subjects of videos but this is different from saying something offensive to someone random who you know nothing about.) Of course it's their game, and they can run it how they want, but if were going to use that argument might as well not have the boards in the first place.\n\nThis is actually interesting because no one would ever say anything like this over voice chat, unless they actually meant it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2017-03-04T00:32:42.372+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Kpfuse,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=1E9n2AaB,comment-id=00060000,timestamp=2017-03-03T20:54:18.618+0000)\n>\n> _Not trying to defend myself, I accept the ban and as a very competitive person i&#x27;m not really interested in playing a game where trash talk is punished like this and the players are treated like children._\n\nglad you get the message. you won't be missed.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"elduris","date":"2017-02-28T22:36:54.456+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"Does it warrant a punishment?
