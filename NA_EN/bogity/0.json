It is possible that if you leave the orbs there for many months or for a really long time, we might do something to clean it up.  However, the orbs won't disappear once the event ends.  You'll still be able to open them.  In terms of orbs, the only thing that will happen when the event ends is that you won't be able to redeem or buy new orbs.\n\nI hope this explains things a bit!  Hit me up if you need to know anything else!","replies":[]}]}
