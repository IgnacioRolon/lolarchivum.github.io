After a season, a player who tries to get chests probably has around 40~ champions that can't get the chest on. I read somewhere that this limitation was reseted after a season, making every champion able to get chests again, but I'm not sure, and since this point wasn't addressed during the patch notes, I'd like if someone cleared that up for me.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-10T00:37:18.303+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's not a confirmed *date* when the refresh for chest-eligibility will reset, but it's supposed to happen with the 2017 Season, so it can't be that far off.
