Usually i'll come to the site not logged in to find my own, but when i press enter or click on the magnifying glass to initiate a search, simply nothing happens - the page doesn't even try to load.  If i log in i can easily view my own match history, but the search bar at the top of that page is still unusable.  Does anyone else who uses firefox encounter this issue?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-02T23:48:25.500+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Does this only happen with Firefox, or do you experience this on other browsers as well?

It was a firefox-only issue and clearing the cache did not help.  I was reluctant to find the most-likely cause of a clashing add-on since I have so many, but i finally gave and did just that.  After lots of browser restarting, i found this addon to be the issue https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/open-bookmarks-in-new-tab/?src=ss  I'm still going to use it, but at least i'll know what i must do to view match history from now on.","replies":[]}]}]}
