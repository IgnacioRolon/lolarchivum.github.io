The text field is intended to add any additional context or comments.  You're submitting a report because another player caused a negative experience, so you can use the field to add anything extra if you want.  Keep in mind it's not totally necessary, so you can submit your report without anything in that field.  Let me know if that clears things up!","replies":[]},{"poster":"NozomiTsuki","date":"2017-04-11T09:24:01.069+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As far as I know, it's only optional to write a description when you report someone. But usually it's a good place to elaborate on whatever section you checked, like what a person said that was offensive, and why it is offensive, and things like that. If it was a way of game play, then you can explain what they did during the game that made you decide to report this person. If you remember around what time during the game they did a certain something, I am sure that also helps Riot prioritize what they should be looking out for. For example, if you remember that the offense happened around the 20 minute range in game, I would mention that so that Riot knows what time frame they should be looking for if they review a game. Hope that helped!","replies":[]}]}
