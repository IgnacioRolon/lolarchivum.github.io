I want to know if making some lighthearted jokes around misplays would be considered toxic, because something may be funny to me or other people may not be funny towards others.

If you are not talking to your actual friend, then think of this, would you look at a complete stranger in the eyes and say what you are about to say in real life?  If not, then don't say it.  It is true this is just a video game.

It's a bit difficult to know if something was intended as a joke and some people may not find it so funny whilst other people would find it funny. At this point I'd rather not type anything related to that type of subject matter just to avoid a misunderstanding or hurt someone else's feelings.

They're insulting to a modest degree (claiming the enemy team as being easily beaten), but I don't think they'd qualify as banter.\n\nThe best way to think about banter is to make light of something, without being insulting. My best example would be saying \"Man, I sure got popular fast\" when a large amount of the enemy team moves to gank you or expends a lot of their longer cooldowns to take you out.\n\nBut, that's just one example. There's a lot of ways to engage in banter, and even more ways for it to go over the line and become toxicity, but for lack of any better explanation, it's definitely best to refer to the definition of banter.\n\n> **Banter**\n> _noun_\n> - the playful and friendly exchange of teasing remarks\n>\n> _verb_\n> - talk or exchange remarks in a good-humored teasing way.\n\nAlways check to see if your jokes and jibes fit those four keywords; _playful, friendly, good-humored, &amp; teasing._ Doesn't have to fit all of them, but obviously the more the better.","replies":[{"poster":"Pombagira","date":"2020-02-11T03:47:42.967+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"PB4UAME","date":"2020-02-11T01:16:44.328+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"\"ggez\" is, or at least was for over five years a ban-able offense, so was saying \"free.\"  Also don't go around insulting people, calling them \"trash\" or \"bronze/iron,\" telling people to uninstall, kill themselves, go play x game instead, etc  These things are 100% toxic and not at all friendly in any way.
