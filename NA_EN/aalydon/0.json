Faster attack speed, and the minigun still scales with it, but significantly reduced auto damage.

The thought came about because Jinx minigun doesn't \"feel\" like a minigun in comparison to Urgot's.\n\nTelling me, specifically, to \"learn to kite\" is off topic to the discussion, If you had said something along the lines of \"she'd be able to kite anyone without orbwalking, OPOP\", then we'd have a discussion.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GankedByWindows","date":"2017-08-01T16:08:50.070+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"No. This heavily nerfs her for people who can actually orb walk. Not being able to select your targets is a HUGE deal. Practice orb walking in the practice tool and try using the attack move keybinds.

He is a champion that can, and wants to just waltz in slowlly like a literal tank and soak up damage while dishing out just as much. But Jinx not supposed to be tanky at all, she supposed to be running around and kitting. Giving her an Urgot W goes completely against her gameplay paradigm.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Naching","date":"2017-08-01T15:53:31.299+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"No thanks","replies":[]},{"poster":"La Bello","date":"2017-08-01T14:33:07.891+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"+1\n\nfor this although I would maybe like something a bit more unique. \nthe whole W attack while moving is really Urgots thing so I wouldnt want a aspect of his kit so haphazardly stolen and plopped onto Jinx.\n\nI think some more orignal ways you could spice up Jinx\n\nIDEA#1\n-Overheat function on Pow-Pow  but it gives MUCH more attack speed than normal ( at max rank this ability could cap Jinx's AS all by itself without help from runes or items). Once Pow-Pow overheats it loses its attack speed bonus until Jinx  doesn't use it for 4 seconds\n\nIDEA #2\n-Fishbone rockets become free-fire skillshots. Right click or Aim at a ground targeted area to let loose a rocket that flies to that location exploding dealing damage as a normal auto that can crit+ applying on hits. the cooldown of this ability scales with attack speed and critical strikes have doubled explosion radius(think Xerath {{champion:101}} ultimate but as a basic form of attack)","replies":[{"poster":"Aalydon","date":"2017-08-01T14:39:58.531+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'd like idea#1 if it was either combined with the attack while moving thing Urgot has, or even just on it's own. Not bad. Idea #2 sounds like Kog's ulti on steroids.\n\nEdit: I would think if #1 was combined with Urgot's W, you could disregard an attack speed cap entirely because the minigun will just overheat at some point, and reset it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Stick In Mudd","date":"2017-08-01T14:10:45.545+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"It'll definitely be spicier, and a whole lot easier than performing the orb walk. \n\nAs someone who loves playing jinx, GO FOR IT!!!!     \n\nI want to be able to just kill everything in a teamfight without having to click on any of them, that's too cumbersome and sometimes I misclick.","replies":[{"poster":"Aalydon","date":"2017-08-01T14:16:39.259+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"You'd still have to orb walk with rockets, and most teamfights will start out with you already poking them in rocket form, but yea.
