It shows a couple of my friends as being in game for 10000+ minutes and friends who are online in the mobile app are not actually online in the league client. Is there a way to force a refresh?

So, what's happening here is that the list is actually in the process of refreshing itself but there's no way to tell. While it's updating, it shows the last known state of your friends. So force refreshing wouldn't actually do anything, since it's already trying to refresh. \n\nWe're working on some feedback to make it more clear what's happening, but it's not the top priority feature on our list right now.","replies":[]}]}
