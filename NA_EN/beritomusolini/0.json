Out of 10 ARAM games, for instance, 9 have at least one bot and 5 are 90% bots. No matter how many reports there are, nothing seems to change and Riot takes minimal to no action at all. Take blizzard's example and come up with a permanent ban punishment for people who use bots and you'll see how things shall change in a matter of days. Until then, the low lvl experience of this game will be trashy and completely inappropriate for a game that calls itself an e-sport. Shame on you, Riot.","replies":[{"poster":"Chermorg","date":"2018-05-18T01:26:34.036+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"But they already permanently ban botted accounts.\n\nThey just do it in waves, not right after detection, so as to ensure that the people creating these bots can't use the detected game as a manner to reverse engineer Riot's detection systems.","replies":[{"poster":"WukongMain","date":"2018-05-18T01:43:53.855+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also i feel like it gives players who use botted accounts time to get invested in these accounts.\n\nAnd then heartbroken when they're banned.\n\nThey will now less likely use a botted account in the future.(i think)","replies":[{"poster":"CubanThund3r","date":"2018-05-18T02:12:54.016+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"odd. is it like.. a bi yearly type wave..?","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2018-05-18T05:19:27.753+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nah, more often than that. I'm not gonna go looking for it but about a year ago a red commented on someones ban saying that they had been caught a few months prior. I seem to remember it being like 3 months? Could be wrong.\n\nOf course, it is possible they do waves every day and just delay when they ban accounts. Unlikely that is the exact case but you get the point.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Pika Fox","date":"2018-05-18T03:04:10.588+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"They do ban these accounts.
