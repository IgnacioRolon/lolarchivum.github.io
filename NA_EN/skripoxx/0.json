(You can skip right to the gameplay now and that change prolly broke shit) Today's programmers are average at best because there are so many of them and RIOT hired the average ones for as little money as possible. We just have to deal with it until they pull their heads out and find a fix because you are not the only one having this problem that shouldn't exist if people could do their damn jobs right.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Riot 5oda","date":"2019-07-09T15:27:07.194+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey guys!  Can you try checking your games as of this morning?  We ran some catch up stuff to help those of you who already watched games.  The challenge is that our missions are time-bound, so you have to watch when the mission is live.  If you are a habitual VOD viewer, we are flagging those games as already watched, so when you have the mission and go back to watch anything you already did, it doesn't count.  We're working on making that better in the future...the time limitation is definitely a bother for those of us who prefer to binge watch VODs (I am definitely one of them).","replies":[{"poster":"prounderdog","date":"2019-07-09T20:16:01.323+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do rift rivals games count for the LEC mission?","replies":[{"poster":"prounderdog","date":"2019-07-09T20:16:31.670+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"cause they ain't working if they are supposed to","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MalrothDragonia","date":"2019-07-09T15:32:36.114+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm pretty upset actually, like, if you want to encourage me to watch games, wouldn't you want us to watch them live?
