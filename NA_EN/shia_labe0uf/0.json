It started normally enough but about the 20 minute mark I started to notice that sometimes when clicking to move, instead of saying one of the depressing Omega skin lines, I instead heard &quot;Armed and Ready&quot; in the voice from classic teemo. Considering this line is a movement line and cannot be heard by enemies it&#039;s quite safe to say it shouldn&#039;t happen.\r\n\r\nStep by Step recreation:\r\n1. Play twisted treeline (don&#039;t know if it&#039;s map specific).\r\n2. Play as Omega Squad Teemo, play against a Teemo in classic skin.\r\n3. click to move.\r\n\r\nThis occurred about once for every 2-3 Omega Squad Teemo lines\r\nIf it&#039;s needed the full list of champions used in the match were;\r\n\r\nBlue Team:\r\nOmega Squad Teemo\r\nSoraka\r\nLunar Goddess Diana\r\n\r\nRed Team:\r\nWukong\r\nTeemo\r\nMiss Fortune","replies":[{"poster":"JayHog1992","date":"2016-04-19T14:15:11.253+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sometimes I think that tends to happen more often than not...\n\nSometimes I hear lines from Jhin that aren't supposed to happen.","replies":[{"poster":"Nanuk Pihoqahiak","date":"2016-05-20T11:43:46.835+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe you're insane and Jhin is actually alright.\n\nDo you hear them after stepping on his traps?
