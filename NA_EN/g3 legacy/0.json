I've mained ADC however i play support at roughly the same level, and I'm more interested in the support position, if \ninterested i can elaborate in tryouts.\n\nRank: Plat 5 season 7, peaked p4. just finished promos and placed silver 2.\n\nChamp Pool: Support: (Rakan, Poppy, Thresh, Braum.)      Adc: Jinx, Xayah, Twitch, Trist. I am open and quick to expanding my champ pool if necessary these are just my best.\n\nI want to join because: i'm interested in developing as a player in a team environment and helping others improve to improve the success of the team. it's my goal to become a top tier player my hope is that this will be a positive growth experience.\n\nStrengths: Shot calling, Macro understanding, Drive to improve, Aggressive mechanics, lane dominance with coordinated duo partner, kind to other players. willing to take responsibility and learn from my calls. Generally good at seeing engaging opportunities.\n\nWeaknesses: Tilting, Occasional over Aggression, expect a lot of effort from teammates, tunnel visioning, variability of mood causing high and low peaks of play.  Moderate in relation to platinum skill level at most micro concepts like: csing, positioning, and reaction speed.\n\nyou benefit from choosing me because: i thrive in team environment's due to my aggressive play style and proactive macro and engagement calls. Secondly but most importantly, i believe the drive i bring to improve myself and the team i believe is my most valuable asset i bring to the team environment assuming we are like minded in our goals for improvement. \n\nlastly i would like to note, that my account is border-less due to a 2 week ban i got from jokingly saying \"keywords\" in a normal game 2 months before the season ended (i was actually joking around when i got this penalty). However, I wont deny that i have been toxic in the past due to an inability to express my feelings of frustration in an appropriate manner. I don't mind talking more in-depth about this if you are interested however, i have no interest in being toxic or blaming others anymore, my only goal is to improve.\n\n\nthanks for the time, have a nice day. -Irima.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Limited Skill","date":"2018-02-25T00:55:43.062+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"App: ?\nIGN: Limited Skill\nOP.gg Link: http://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=Limited%20Skill\nRole: ADC\nRank: Mid Gold (gold 3 atm)\nChamp pool: Draven, Xayah, Trist, Kog, Cait, Twitch, Vayne (can pick up Jinx, Ez, Jhin, Varus)\nWhy do you want to join: Want to join a team\nStrengths: Draven\nWeaknesses: Macro\nWhy do we benefit from choosing you: DRAAAVEN {{champion:119}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"T I L T B O I","date":"2018-02-25T00:26:52.971+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm...guessing your adc and supp from last week already quit\n\nprobably not related to your attitude\n\ngood luck!","replies":[{"poster":"G3 Legacy","date":"2018-02-25T00:32:55.935+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So far no one has made it past the tryout phase. we don't care about skill just following instruction and in game following up on calls. that's why you were declined man. you didn't make it past the very first part of the tryout.
