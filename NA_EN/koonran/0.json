It's likely that it's still checking files and replacing any corrupt ones. Sometimes this process can take up to 90 minutes, so be sure to let it run for a while before you close it and it should complete just fine.\n\nIf you're still stuck at 33% after a few hours of it running, try using the in-client repair function. At the top right, click the question mark and then the \"Repair\" button in the resulting popup. This will restart the patching process, but if there are any corrupt files blocking the patcher this should clear them out.\n\nLet me know if either of those steps gets you going again.","replies":[{"poster":"ArlanKels","date":"2016-03-12T00:03:38.030+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MarshmallowBob,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=KfkwopqR,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-03-11T23:09:30.017+0000)\n>\n> Hey KoonRan,\n> \n> The reason that the patcher generally sticks at 33% is that is the transition between checking files and actually downloading the patch.

If it's still saying the same thing(33% and calculating differences) then you probably gots a problem.\n\n\nI did have an issue where hitting Repair caused it to BUGSPLAT, though.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TheLoneLlama","date":"2016-03-11T21:29:28.515+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"im having the same problem","replies":[]}]}
