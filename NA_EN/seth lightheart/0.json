The 10% HP cost means that she can only heal 10 times from a full HP bar, regardless of her max HP.  Having a smaller max HP means her Q heals will recover a larger percentage of her HP bar, thus allowing her to heal more.  When she stacks HP, she loses it at the same rate as before, but heals herself for smaller percentages of her HP bar.","replies":[{"poster":"Seth Lightheart","date":"2015-04-13T20:58:56.246+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You know, you are right about it costing % HP than a flat number.

More HP *would* mean Soraka would live longer before/between heals, but in the long run, her team would suffer if they need frequent heals.  Warmog's Armor and Righteous Glory are HP items that are commonly built on Soraka, but the biggest reason is the regen.  Soraka thrives on HP regen.  RG also has the added benefit of a team movement speed active, something that is always useful for supports.  Talisman of Ascension is the most common full item built by pro players because it has several of the things you want for Soraka: **HP Regen**, Mana Regen, CDR, Movement Speed, Gold Generation, additional Gold/**HP** for nearby enemy minion deaths that she didn't kill, and an active team movement buff.\n\nSoraka's HP at 18 is 1855.  If you heal 5 times, she is now at ~950 (slightly higher than half due to regen).  A successful Q would heal her for (65 (+40%AP)) x 1.48.  That's 96.2 + (40%AP x 1.48).  At 0AP, that's over 5% HP healed at about 50% HP.  She would have to Q two targets to regain 1 W cast of HP.\n\nIf you stack HP to 3000, healing 5 times would place her at a little over 1500HP.  A successful Q would heal her for (65 (+40%AP)) x 1.49.  That's 96.85 + (40%AP x 1.49).  At 0AP, that's 3.2% healed at about 50%HP.  She would have to Q four targets to regain 1 W cast of HP.\n\nYou know how sometimes you're forced to spam heals on someone until you're out of HP?  At around 2600 max HP, a successful Q on one target still won't heal you enough to hit the 5% minimum HP that you need to cast another targeted heal.\n\nIdeally, you'd itemize for defense like most defensive builds.  Resistances *and* HP, prioritizing resistances.  You don't want to be completely HPless, but you don't want to take full damage from people, either.","replies":[{"poster":"Seth Lightheart","date":"2015-04-13T23:30:13.144+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No.  I understand what you are saying.  It is you who does not seem to understand what I am saying.  What I am talking about is: What if every time you cast a spell, instead of it costing X HP, you took X damage.

Armor and mr are not just the best >way to get tanky... it's the only effective way.\n\nWell the actual passive its so weird and need some more to be efficent. Actually only works its someone \"weak\" its near to you, so much of the time you never uses it, I really love the idea of a \"health conversion engine passive\", when the Soraka rework comes out she have a secondary passive that turns every 20% of armor and 20% of mr into AP, so if you build a Zz'Rot Portal you gain 48 of armor, 48 of mr and 24 of AP, instead of 60 oh armor and 60 mr. With more AP you have more damage and health amount, yeah sound great \"on paper\" but at the cost of lose more defenses, and hp being a not \"worthable\" stat on her, Soraka turn into a Mega Squishy champ, and obviusly very easy target to get down. They notice that and remove the secondary passive but never give \"somnething new\" to the empty slot in her secondary passive. So why not try some kind of the Vlad passive but with the \"conversion\" effect and make a secondary passive. Something like this:\n\nFirst we need to understand some \"vital\" aspects to the conversion.\n\n> Every 1 hit point is equivalent to 2.67 gold\n> \n> Every 1 ability point is equivalent to 21.36 gold\n\nThis mean that every 8 hit points equivalent to 1 ability point (2.67 * 8 = 21.36)\n\nSo with this in mind the secondary passive of Soraka try about a coversion of health into AP:\n\n> _Blood is Knowledge_: 12.5% of the Soraka 50% bonus health is turning into AP.\n\nSo how work this?\n\nA example of this conversion: \n\n> Soraka builds a Sight Stone, (150hp) Spirit Visage(400hp), Warmog's (800hp).\n> Its a total of 1350 of bonus hp. \n\nThis means that the secondary passive  _Blood is Knowledge_ took the 50% of 1350hp and turn 12.5% into AP:\n\n> 1350 * 0.5 = 675 (this is the real value that Soraka gain in hp)\n> \n> 675 * 0.125 = 84.375 (this is the amount of AP that Soraka gain)\n\nThe final numbers of _Blood is Knowledge_ are:\n\n> Bonus Health: 1350\n> HP that Soraka gain = 675\n> AP that Soraka gain = 84.375.\n\nSo instead that Soraka gain 1350 of hp , she gain 675 hp and 84.375 AP.\n\nIs this equivalent in gold?\n\nTurning back to the \"conversion aspects\" :\n\n> _ Every 8 hit points equivalent to 1 ability point (2.67 * 8 = 21.36)_ where: \n\n> 2.67 = price of hp per point\n> 8 = amounts of hp\n> 21.36 = price of Ap per point\n\nThis means:\n\n> 8hp = 1AP in price amount.\n\nThe \"gold amount\" conversion:\n\n> 84.375*21.36= 1802,25\n> \n> 675 * 2.67 = 1802,25\n\nAnothe equivalents:\n\n> 675 / 8 = 84.375\n> \n> or\n> \n>  84.375 * 8 = 675\n\nYep is the same amount of gold. _AWESOME!_\n\nSoraka don't lose any gold in the conversion, and now she gains AP when builds HP. This mean that if she builds a lot of HP, gains some of HP and her 10% max health ist not hurt her a lot.\n\nMore HP would mean Soraka would live longer before/between heals, but in the long run, her team would suffer if they need frequent heals. Warmog's Armor and Spirit Visage are HP items that are commonly built on Soraka, but the biggest reason is the regen. Soraka thrives on HP regen.  \n\nSome calculate's with her actual passive (without the conversion HP > AP)\n\n> Soraka's HP at 18 is 1855. If you heal 5 times, she is now at ~950 (slightly higher than half due to regen). A successful Q would heal her for (65 (+40%AP)) x 1.48. That's 96.2 + (40%AP x 1.48). At 0AP, that's over 5% HP healed at about 50% HP. She would have to Q two targets to regain 1 W cast of HP.\n> \n> If you stack HP to 3000, healing 5 times would place her at a little over 1500HP. A successful Q would heal her for (65 (+40%AP)) x 1.49. That's 96.85 + (40%AP x 1.49). At 0AP, that's 3.2% healed at about 50%HP. She would have to Q four targets to regain 1 W cast of HP.\n> \n\nSo lets check again the last case but with the _Blood is Knowledge_ passive:\n\nFirst some important calcules:\n\n> 3000 HP in the last case means 1145 of bonus health. (that 3000-1855 = 1145)\n> \n> 1145*0.5 = 572 of HP\n> 572*0.125 = 71.5 AP\n> \n> 3000-572= 2428 total health.\n> \n> 71.5*0.40= 28.6 (40% of AP)\n\nSo now the calculate:\n\n> If you stack HP to 2428, healing 5 times would place her at a little over 1200HP. A successful Q would heal her for (65 (+28.6) x 1.49. That's 139.46 At 71 AP, that's over 5% HP healed at about 50% HP. She would have to Q two targets to regain 1 W cast of HP.\n> \n\nThis mean that with this new secondary passive she can health better when build some HP.\n\nIdeally, you'd itemize for defense like most defensive builds. Resistances and HP, prioritizing resistances. You don't want to be completely HPless, but you don't want to take full damage from people, either. So the AP bonus that her secondary passive grants its not so high but its a considerable amount to help her.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Delimon","date":"2015-04-13T20:50:04.377+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Or we could do ^'s idea of % max hp as well as instead of making it an HP cost actually make it a mana cost with a higher cd because killing yourself as a healer is retarded.","replies":[{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2015-04-13T23:05:35.126+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"That's what her heal used to be like.
