This account just got a 14 day suspension after getting chat suspension twice and just right when I finally left bronze. I already know I'm a toxic person as I flame my teammates in other games as well on different platforms. I'm wondering if there's any way to overcome this or become less toxic so that I can actually keep an account longer than a year and stop buying rp only to lose that account.","replies":[{"poster":"VindicatorOFThey","date":"2019-09-24T09:07:36.753+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":">How do you not be toxic\n\nRemove the Enter button  so you wont be able to use the chat ,,, or just  move the chat away from the screen.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MrFawknSunshine","date":"2019-09-24T00:20:24.260+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"how not to be toxic is similar to how not to be an asshole\n\never were told/taught that \"golden rule\" if you cant say anything nice , dont say anything at all? \n\noh and being mature, lack of maturity is typically what causes toxicity in this game. makes sense considering majority of the player base is adolescence males. teens to early 20s. \n\nalso realize this is a video game, you can not control what the other 9 players do/dont do. you will not win every game and you will not lose every game but you will win about as much as you lose. \n\nthis is the internet, the dumbass who got you so tilted in game you will most likely never see again in a game nor ever in real life. so what is the point to flame, argue , tilt etc ? it proves nothing, does nothing but get you reported and banned. \n\nbest way to not get banned is to never use chat at all. \n\nif you do use chat keep it generic to the game. \"jungle top\" \"need gank\" \"lets go drag/baron\" etc","replies":[]},{"poster":"MLG Quincey","date":"2019-09-26T17:30:14.856+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You gotta not swear in game, otherwise you go to hell.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JacksonTheTerror","date":"2019-09-24T20:25:50.729+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's pretty hard to get banned for flaming unless you're repeatedly racist.

The ban was unjust but whatever. Since then, I don't speak much in chat. I've realized you will always at some point get some 1-13 trash can on your team. Nothing anyone can do about that. So I don't stress over it. Sometimes when it gets over bearing. I just tell my team I'm leaving and log out. I don't bother flaming or throwing tantrums because it's not like that shit happens once in a while. Waste of energy being overly angry with so many countless people.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AJStarhiker","date":"2019-09-24T00:48:59.484+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Learn to identify your own mindset before the game starts.
