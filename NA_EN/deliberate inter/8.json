The champ OBVIOUSLY got buffed because she was receiving a skin. Now she's practically a GOD and Riot doesn't bat an eye. Because they're not the squishy support who has to deal with her two shotting everyone with her stupid passive and ult. This game is such a fucking piece of trash. A complete disgrace to what used to be League of Legends. I give it about a year. The game will eventually die. I'm going to throw a party when it does.\n\nYou do realize this post just wants to buff Vayne even further, right?","replies":[{"poster":"Deliberate Inter","date":"2019-02-18T14:36:22.701+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Vayne loses every matchup and gets out scaled in solo queue let alone coordinated play.  Maybe if we could have protect the X compositions with stuff like orianna and lulu vayne as she is now would be good but ori and lulu suck because of ap itemization","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Deliberate Inter","date":"2019-02-18T14:35:38.922+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My post is asking for a vayne buff becuase she is more like a varus and less like a lucian did you read it/","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Deliberate Inter","date":"2019-02-18T02:23:35.581+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Brony Gaymer,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=v4PplJQE,comment-id=,timestamp=2019-02-18T02:23:05.999+0000)\n>\n> I think the champion, monster or minion vayne condemns should briefly knock up and do the damage to the units it moves through like a lee sin kick but without the maxx health damage because vayne is supposed to be kitey but the cc is single target and that isnt the best.
