I mean,  it's not like cleanses and CC cancels aren't in the game or like we don't already have champions with CC and ways to play into and against or around them.  And let's be honest,  if zed gets an ideal W or R unto you he doesn't have to aim his skillshots either, there are different % to hit configurations where zed is harder or easir to land.  Not to mention he doesn't ALWAYS auto,  especially in lane trading or hectic teamfights where he doesn't want to or can't afford to commit.  Skill shot accuracy will still be important as will tempo, priority and spacing.  And a fed zed that gets unto you and gets his kill condition is SUPPOSED to kill you and will kill you anyway,  this is thematic fix.","replies":[{"poster":"CauseSCIENCE","date":"2019-02-26T22:58:00.858+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pyke was designed a support so we can let that go, but yeah fizz shouldn't have cc, you're right. Champions with mobility dont need cc. Look i don't like his current passive much easier, but a massive stun is only going to make it worse. A microstun, like the one on akali's ult, I might be able to live with. Mind you, what's the cooldown going to be on a stun this long. Cause i aint going to have spellshield/cleanse/quicksilver/zhonyas up every 10 seconds. Assassins shouldnt have cc, cause then there would be almost no way to counter them in duels. The difference is i can atleast flash/dash/blink away when he jumps on me, following up with my own cc to stop him from immediately hopping right back on me. Instead, all he has to do is W right next to me then auto before i can do anything and he's won. I can see how the stun wouldn't really make a difference in teamfights however. His only skillshot wont exactly be hard to land either. Yes a fed zed is supposed to kill you, he is, after all, an assassin, but the addition of a stun would prevent me from\n\na) getting away from him\nb) using zhonyas or any other form of cc \nc) surviving","replies":[{"poster":"Deliberate Inter","date":"2019-02-26T23:00:02.894+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"I didn't say fizz shouldn't have CC,   I jokingly made fun of you for implying that but oh my god,  you knew what you were saying and were serious?

He's a support, that's his job. If you're talking about a 2.25 second stun every 6 seconds at rank 1, then we have a problem. Regardless of that, how exactly would you negate it? Assuming that he would be played primarily in the midlane, Fiora, Pantheon, and Jax are all toplaners, and there's no guarantee Panth's passive will be up. Furthermore, he can simply wait them out. As for spellshields, Zed could easily trigger it with a q before autoattacking. Plus, you would need pretty fast reactions to use cc cancels for a damn autoattack, although it's not impossible. Also he's still an assassin, he'll almost certainly be able to burst you down even without his auto, and like you said, he doesn't usually have a chance to auto during engages. Mind you all those counters you listed apply to a lot of champions, nothign really unique there. \n\nLook, I don't have any problems with giving Zed a small buff, as he has a terrible lategame right now, but the average cc length for an ability being around 1-1.5 seconds, excluding things such as morgana's q, which has a very long travel time. and fiddle's fear, which does no damage and requires very close range, both of which sporting long cooldowns and both of them on primarily support characters with no mobility, something like this would be simply too strong on someone like zed.\n\nEdit: damn i have no life arguing with random people over the internet, oh well.","replies":[{"poster":"Deliberate Inter","date":"2019-02-27T03:01:57.624+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Words of wisdom : You can't compare champion abilities in a vacuum.","replies":[{"poster":"CauseSCIENCE","date":"2019-02-27T05:40:14.102+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If so, then every champion is equal, it is impossible for something to be broken, and League would somehow manage to be in a much worse state then it already is.","replies":[{"poster":"CauseSCIENCE","date":"2019-02-27T23:19:24.395+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The reason Nautilus has root in the first place is because he does very little damage, because he is a support, and relies on the adc to do damage for him. Zed, however, does a lot of damage, along with Talon and other assassins, who have little or no cc at all and still manage to do well. The only real complaint I have with giving Zed a stun is that you said a **2.25** second stun on a **6** second cd. So you're spending over a third of your time stunned. This is like a Morgana root, Fiddle fear, or Ashe ult at low ranks. Morgana's has a long cd, a slow travel speed and only roots, her kit relies on ccing others and letting your team do the damage. Fiddle again has a long cd and the fear can only be used at close range, his kit again relies on others to deal damage. Ashe's stun is only really effective at long range, and is difficult to aim, She is a utility adc, her kit allows her to assist others even on the other side of the map. Zed's kit relies on him getting anywhere near you then shredding you before you can do anything. Giving him a stun would be _extremely_ useful. All he has to do is w up to you and auto. If the stun was, say, 0.75 seconds, maybe scaling up to 1.25 seconds, with a cd scaling down over time, e.g. (8, 7, 6, 5, 4). Then I would be fine with it, as it gives him a little more power in the lategame.\n\nAlso you should be addressing the whole of my argument regardless of how many \"gaping holes\", you think you see. Otherwise how else would I learn to improve it? Unless you actually can't find as many holes as you say, but that might just be wishful thinking, i dont know.\n\nI'm quite enjoying this argument, by the way.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CauseSCIENCE","date":"2019-02-27T06:49:08.795+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you can't compare abilities then you can't compare anything.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Deliberate Inter","date":"2019-02-28T16:19:02.693+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"You said nobody is as if you're the same person.
