I&#039;ve spend thousands of dollars on this game, and I would take a chat ban for a large amount of games. But the game I got banned permanently for was pretty ridiculous. Playing adc, I muted my support pretty early on because she was being ridiculous, and it got to the point where I didn&#039;t even want to lane with her anymore. So I went top, told everyone what I was doing, and proceeded to mute Nami (the support). Once the game went on, I decided to unmute the Nami because I wanted to communicate, but she was still flaming me. I also muted the jungler (Rengar) in the meantime, but unmuted him at the same time. Kinda got into it with the nami, but never asked anyone to report anyone, while the Nami was constantly asking to report me. I really didn&#039;t want to get anyone reported, but this Nami was persistent. And then when we ended up losing the game,the jungler (Rengar) wanted me reported as well, because in that Elo someone HAS to get reported for a loss. So then the automated system banned me permanently because I just got out of a ban. I don&#039;t quite understand how this merits a PERMANENT ban, instead of another 14 day ban or a chat restriction. I&#039;ve spent so much money on this account, that I don&#039;t know if I can bring myself to play this game anymore if my main account is banned forever because of an argument.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Tantram","date":"2016-01-24T22:14:58.152+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":1,"body":"I've read the chat logs, and it's pretty clear to me.
