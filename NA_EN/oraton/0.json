I came back and was doing really well, but then i had some games where I played badly and people were bad talking me.  This set me off and I returned the toxicity, and had a few games in a row where people were being toxic to me.  How do I keep from letting them tilt me into being toxic? Should I just mute all before the game so they never have the chance to tilt me?","replies":[]}
