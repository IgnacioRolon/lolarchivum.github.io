I also tried to change logo, which it has as the right logo and saved. But, when I saved it, it just just goes back to the white Shortcut that is the standard for unknown file Location. However When I open the Shortcut it works. Seems to be a Windows 10 Pro Error and not League Specific. Any Professionals out there know how to fix it without complete uninstall and reinstall? If I don't get a response back.. I'll just reinstall it tonight before I go to sleep.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/Uv9jmxH.png","replies":[{"poster":"Bird Brains","date":"2017-04-05T15:30:00.819+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"ok I'm really dumb I coulda figured that out hoelee mowlee thx.

(Typically C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\n- Open the client by using \"lol.launcher.admin.exe\"\n\nLet me know if that helps.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bird Brains","date":"2017-04-05T15:26:24.658+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ok thx I'm going to see right now","replies":[]}]}
