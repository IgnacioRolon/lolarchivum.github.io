I would give endless praise to Riot if they managed to give a satisfying death to one of their champions. \n\nGoing by Jhin's release-date fantasies, the events leading up to this could well involve him putting down or severely damaging Vi, prompting Camille to intervene while Caitlyn is mourning or watching over Vi. Then a major hunt goes on as Jhin prepares to attempt his most perfect performance on the most perfect entity that is Camille.\n\nCamille then kills Jhin, only to find out later that he believed his own perfect end could never be achieved by anyone but Camille.","replies":[{"poster":"Cetri","date":"2019-01-22T22:40:16.566+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I doubt Jhin would be willing to let anyone kill him without first dealing with Shen and Zed.

That would not make for a satisfying denouement for his greatest nemeses, after all.\n\nBut that is, to Jhin, diminishing the all-encompassing importance of his art. He has no such thing as a nemesis, only sources of inspiration, and rude rubes getting in his way. I feel like when Jhin left Ionia behind, he also left Shen, Zed and all that drama behind him in order to pursue higher standards of art.\n\nAnd then, you have the Muse syndrome. There has to be an official name for that somewhere, but basically the idea is that an artist devoted to a subject closes his mind to things that aren't his source of inspiration, and the greater the source, the more an artist could forego in order to make the pursuit of art absolute. Renaissance artists pushing themselves to starvation in order to focus on their art was a thing, if i remember correctly.\n\nJhin, i think, represents this pushed to the farthest. \n\nI'd see it like this; He heads to Piltover after hearing rumors of Vi, her vibrant and violent existence attracting his fancy as an inspiration for art. Then he executes his piece but as a result he finds a much greater muse in Camille. Thus, he dedicates his entire existence to making the perfect piece, then realizes he would never create a better piece, and includes his own life to the piece, either intending his muse to survive himself, or to blow himself up alongside her.\n\nAll that's missing is Kindred sitting in the audience, Lamb waiting for the finale while Wolf gorges himself on the troopers.","replies":[{"poster":"4 Step Cadence","date":"2019-01-22T23:43:53.502+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> \"The work was inescapable.

She's very experienced, but Shen and Zed aren't exactly spring chickens.
