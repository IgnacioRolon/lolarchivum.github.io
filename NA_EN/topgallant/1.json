I was just curious if there were any plans to bring him artistically into the identity of all of the other Shadow Isles champions have? Whether that be a skin like Underworld Mordekaiser or in a champion design update.  Personally I think the Shadow Isles has been identified artistically in such an awesome way I would really like to see that sort of change for Morde. Be it a legendary skin or an update I would gladly pay for/wait for it. Just looking for a short answer just as a confirmation. \n\nTL;DR Are there plans to rework Mordekaiser artistically to be in line with the current Shadow Isles identity or is their plans for a skin to do that?","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2015-03-24T22:04:13.768+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"When we do a visual upgrade for Mordekaiser we'll definitely want to make him look like he matches his origins (the Shadow Isles).
