For example Poppy and GP hopefully making it out this season. Is there any indication as to where either season wise or month wise we can get and EXTREMELY rough timeframe on Taric&#039;s rework. Sorry to ask again I am just a big Taric fan and would love to seem him in his outrageous glory up to snuff visually and gameplay wise with the other supports.\r\n \r\nThanks in advance for any information you can share.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2015-03-30T18:51:45.301+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not sure on Taric sorry.

I haven't the slightest how you mean. If you're thinking I assumed he's purposefully ignoring her/me, that's not at all what I meant.

Your work was done & that's the impression I got (you even just proved it by saying so)... so I didn't think it'd be a big deal since you got what you were looking for.

I would say Quinn definitely needs some TLC she is my favorite ADC at the moment and while I do manage to win lane it is at the expense of trying my ass off whereas Graves has a much easier time than I.
