They've taken her the tomboyish route, where she prefers to get dirty, scouting the city, casing suspects etc, so I honestly don't think she needs to be a skirt considering her level of activity. I think a more old fashioned version of how she looks in Pulsefire is the best route for her, with the long coat with tails, and the pants. She needs to keep the full top hat though, it's very distinctly her style and it's pretty core to her profile. Your upper half of her looks fine, she just needs to lose the skirts.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Arcade Lulu","date":"2019-02-27T21:44:00.235+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://i.imgur.com/xrKTKvh.png\n\nI prefer this tbh","replies":[{"poster":"Chembaron Yamada","date":"2019-02-27T23:03:09.994+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah, I was referencing the same rework for her in my comment, but I prefer the version without the big collar. ^^","replies":[{"poster":"Arcade Lulu","date":"2019-02-27T23:56:02.267+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SatomiKun,realm=EUW,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=8QATUv9G,comment-id=00020001,timestamp=2019-02-27T23:03:09.994+0000)\n>\n> Ah, I was referencing the same rework for her in my comment, but I prefer the version without the big collar. ^^\n\nI love the rework idea because it actually makes caitlyn look cool and badass\n\nNow she's just another girl in a tight fitting short dress\nThe rework idea gives her more personality and attitude","replies":[{"poster":"Chembaron Yamada","date":"2019-02-28T00:04:52.031+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreed, additionally it is a great hommage to the original design by keeping stuff like the belts (even if used differently here) and makes her finally fit in perfectly in modern Piltover, right now she just feels off.

I know why you went with it, being a symbol for sheriffs known from old western movies and stuff. And that is the problem, it is a relict of old western movies. You definitely wouldn't expect a Piltovian law enforcer to have a sheriff star.\n- Pretty dress, while fitting better in the Piltovian aesthetic than the old design (good job on that), does not represent her position well. Look, for example, at Camille. She is a female champion from Piltover with _kinda_ a similar position like her. But her clothes are more functional, look more like an uniform than something a fair lady wears on a gentle sunday.\n- Hextech rifle. I understand that you wanted a more \"steampunkish\" look for it, hence the colours. However, hextech in LoL has a very own colour palette. Silver, blue, and brass (or is it gold? I am sry, I have a red weakness) are dominant and give it a more sci-fi look than steampunkish. \n\nBesides that, there is quite some stuff I like. You did a great job on her hair in my opinion, really gives her another feeling. And I like that you played with her hat a bit, even if it most definitely has to stay a top hat. It is too iconic to let it go.\n\nAll in all: Really good execution, but you should probably rethink the design in general a bit. There is another fan concept in the internet for a visual update for her, which solves alot the problems I mentioned:\nhttp://i.imgur.com/WXqFoEH.png\n\nGiving her an outfit that resembles a uniform more works better for her in my opinion.\nI hope you stay motivated and show us your art, tho. You have great talent and your work has alot of potential. Maybe you might even become a Rioter some day.\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2019-02-28T20:23:21.243+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SatomiKun,realm=EUW,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=8QATUv9G,comment-id=0007,timestamp=2019-02-27T23:00:13.594+0000)\n>\n> - Hextech rifle.

It's not mass produced, it doesn't come from any of the major houses that specialize in Hextech manufacturing, it was made completely custom by her parents. Several Zaunites and Piltovans in game make comments about the antiquity of her rifle, and mock it's appearance, which then tells us that her rifle DOES NOT follow the standard, modern aesthetic of current Hextech weaponry. So her rifle can look pretty much however it wants and still be canon in the lore and game, because it's been shown that it doesn't look new or fit in with the rest of Piltover's technology.","replies":[{"poster":"Chembaron Yamada","date":"2019-02-28T20:34:44.307+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While it is true that it isn't mass produced, it can not \"look how it wants\" in my opinion.\n\nOPs version of the weapon looks kinda... sloppy.

If her parents were expert engineers, but didn't have ANY eye for aesthetic or artistic design, they could make a quality item that looks really ugly. Craftsmanship and artistic design are not intrinsically linked when talking about machinery. I mean hell, that's almost what the entire steampunk aesthetic is based off of - machinery without artistic value merged with Victorian artistic designs and fashion.","replies":[{"poster":"Chembaron Yamada","date":"2019-02-28T21:18:54.064+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Piltover is all about upper class and Caitlyns parents were no no-names.
