To quote Eric Cartman of _South Park_; \"Fuck, fuckity, fuck fuck fuck.\"\n\n---\n\nThat out of the way, I don't really deal with the same issue as you (most of my friends keep away from League, and the one that doesn't plays on a different server, so, can't really gauge if they're any different in-game from how they are when we chat), _but_, I can tell you this much:\n\nThe way you're handling your friends is _great_. There's no good reason for you to be playing with people who openly berate you and throw insults at you, much less people who get worked up and insult you over \"ks'ing\". The kills do not belong to anyone, and the only thing that matters is that _the enemy dies_, and _you do not_.\n\n~~So next time your friends complain about \"ks'ing\", just tell them to git gud.~~\n\nIf League is made less fun by playing with them and having them insult you openly, whether or not those insults are in the presence of randoms or just between you and them - then absolutely, it's all the better that you don't play with them.\n\nThe only thing I would personally do extra - and I can understand why you wouldn't if you didn't yet and/or won't if you play with them again - is to report them for verbal abuse. The inevitable chat restriction and some personal admonition could _hopefully_ be a kick in the ass enough to get them to stop - or at the very least, show you who of them is actually a friend.\n\nEither way, good on you for taking measures to make your League games more fun. Like you said - you aren't weak. You're far from it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2018-09-08T02:24:02.582+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"You should tell all of  that to them in their face.\n\nOr you can point them to this thread.

Of course, if they say that you suck, then you can ask them for ways to improve. IF you want the friendship to continue. \n\nYou can also ask him (assuming the person who is toxic is male) if he thinks that being toxic is cool, and imitating people like ImaQTPie or Tyler1.

After the game we talked and worked things out. \nIts very important to be clear in your relationships (if you value them to be edifying) over what your willing to put up with and are unwilling to put up with.

If they're really your friends, they'd listen to you on the subject matter & hear you out.\n\n-----------------------\n\n> 'She's a trash. Fking noob only play supps'\n\n\"Noobs\" aren't the only ones who play that role, Look at Aphromoo & BunnyFuFu, those guys are experts at the role & compete in LCS. That statement is false & that person doesn't know everything about that role. There's more to it than \"PrOtEcT mE wArD sLaVe\";\n\n- Maintaining Allied Vision on the map & Denying Enemy Vision\n- Healing/Shielding/Peeling for your teammates\n- When to start fights & Disengaging fights\n- Have Map Awareness & keep an eye on missing opponents\n\nI'm sitting at Gold V currently because all I do is play Support, I've played nothing but Brand Support {{champion:63}} in Season 7 & Veigar Support {{champion:45}} for Season 8 (It's scummy, but it works). In the event I want to play other Champions that aren't Brand or Veigar, I play Sion {{champion:14}}  in the supporting role (Glacial Augment/Resolve) & lock everyone down with CC. Speaking of Veigar/Brand Support, this brings me to another point.\n\n> 'Yo stop ks-ing you trash'\n\nWhen I play Brand or Veigar in the supporting role, I will purposely Secure-Kills for our team (assuming that I know for a fact the carry can't get it) and allow my ADC/APC to farm up their items. When these two (Brand & Veigar) get their items, they instantly become the scariest things in the game & you can just carry the shit out of your games with them most of the time. Once in a blue moon, I do get the \"STAHP KS'ING MEH!!!\" message in chat. I just tell them to farm up & get items. Eventually they'll get Takedowns & they will snowball with you. Otherwise, the Takedowns you earn will let you snowball & you'll be able to carry on your own.\n\n_**\"Death is the Best CC\" -Unknown Source **_ \n(If someone can find where this comes from, there's a Poro Snack {{item:2052}} waiting for you)\n\n> 'never duo with her cuz shes trash'\n\nLol, that's fine. When you Queue up on your own & make it to Gold/Platinum/Diamond on your own, you can reap all the rewards that comes with your effort.\n----------------\nI also have a friend that is extremely competitive & has spewed Venom plenty of times during Ranked. I was always quite during those matches & focused on what my Job was (If playing a Damage Support, Get kills & Snowball into a monster. If playing a Tank Support, Peel & lock the enemy down so my Carry Becomes a monster). If he blew up during the match, I just agreed with him that whatever happened was BS & reassured him that one of us will bounce off whatever happened.\n----------------\nIn conclusion, don't let their General Toxicity get to you. Ranked is an extremely different place compared to Regular & people are going to lash out at eachother. If it bothers you & you don't want to deal with it anymore. Talk to them about it & if they refuse to listen, you can make that Solo/Duo climb on your own & make them eat their words. When another friend told me that I was always going to be Bronze Trash, I beat him to Gold V that season (And I did it again this season as well).","replies":[{"poster":"IainG10","date":"2018-09-08T11:53:48.971+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I just carried myself from S4 to G4 on Support Lux, so I'd like to think I know what I'm talking about here....\n\nThere **IS** a difference between Kill Stealing and Kill Securing, but Securing is called Stealing **WAY** more than it proves to be true.\nStealing: Igniting/damage-ulting a dude who is 3 feet from your ADC and certainly not getting away or winning the fight.\nSecuring: Igniting the dude that is just about to {{summoner:4}} over a wall, get out of your ADC's range, kill your ADC before dying etc\nNeither but still called stealing: Accidentally killing someone with CC/and AoE you can't control (e.g. {{champion:89}} W, {{champion:99}} E if you're trying to leave the kill but they just don't die quick enough), getting an Ignite kill because you used it to fuck over that {{summoner:7}} /support heal.\n\nWhen I {{champion:99}} or {{champion:45}} (because the Tiny Master of Evil pairs _really_ well with {{champion:29}}  and {{champion:21}} ) I save ult for when it either won't quite finish someone off, when the target gets out of everyone else's range, or when I'm the last one alive and in the area, so I'm not stealing from anybody. I will happily admit sometimes I fuck this up, but no one is perfect.\n\nAlso, anyone who thinks only noobs play support can try keeping vision up and peeling for themselves for a game, and see how that goes for them.....\n\nAnd yeah, if someone's being too toxic to play with, tell them, and if they don't change, don't list with them.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ifneth","date":"2018-09-08T17:40:41.333+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just leave them, both IRL and in-game.

Doing so will help you understand what your allies are expecting of you and make it easier for you to understand what they are going through.\n\n> 'Yo stop ks-ing you trash'\n\nThis looks bad, but is this really in a lobby?

If so, that's quite sad.\n\n> 'Bitch ping your enemies are u blind'\n\nI'm guessing this means if someone you were fighting with leaves your general area, they want you to give them the yellow ping at where you think they are now so they can put in their mind that they might be coming after them. I have to admit though, that is a very rude way of asking you to do that and if I was new I probably wouldn't be sure what they are asking of me.\n\n> 'never duo with her cuz shes trash' (even though that game i was a MID LUX with kda 12/2/6)\n\nIt seems like they are trying to scare you away from playing with random players.\n\n> Are you guys just kidding? I don't think so. \nSo I decide -- today is my last day of playing with them, at least within this month.\nI don't think we have the same opinions of gaming.\n\nYou are probably making the right decision. If you've been playing with them every game and they're trying to keep you as their ally in their group, that's an indicator to me that they are very afraid  of playing with too many random players. You are one player they are at least aware of how well you play, but every extra random player is one more thing they don't know about so their fear is greater with each additional random player.\n\nYou'll learn to experience if you haven't already what it's like to play with random players. Honestly, groups of players I've found to be more difficult to manage and be diplomatic with and have fun with compared to random players. Maybe it's because they are too fearful and not very brave.\n\nI want to thank you for making this post.
