I do not like stuff like Morgana and so I wonder, what mids would help me learn the role better? I was thinking maybe Annie since she has easy CSing with Q and more zone control than a lot of stuff I play. For example, playing Zilean vs Fizz is a nightmare because his ult.&#039;s lower CD than mine and if he EQs me, I&#039;m already nearly forced to ult. I just get zoned hard. This is a problem I often have. The biggest though is that when I do have lane control, I just die to ganks a lot. Annie would probably solve this since she has her E and also will generally be with the wave closer to her side. If you play Ziggs, you will naturally push, same with Zilean and Xerath. You do it for lane pressure and also because if it gets under turret, you&#039;re going to have a hard time farming. I suppose Kassadin could be an option too but I've always felt that I was not relevant fast enough in the games.","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-11-19T08:20:54.898+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ward a lot and stay near where your wards are so they cant attack from the dark side of the lane.\n\nWhen your minions go up to enemy turret you don't have to follow them.

I tried to just get good CS and sometimes was up a good bit but felt I couldn't help my team enough. I was losing games where I had a decent lead and I only seemed to matter when we grouped mid game. The rest of the time, I was just a farming bot with good CS but no kills or anything else. I figured that wasn't a viable style.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Shiznyte","date":"2017-11-19T20:41:24.091+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"True story...

Attack champions only works only on abilities and it's awkward to use a modifier anyway. I try to target the right thing but sometimes misclick. Not sure how to solve this... I dash in or flash in for some finisher and then auto a minion next to the player....","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nik Nikerson","date":"2017-11-19T10:47:31.184+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wait...

Outside of W interactions there&#x27;s not really much to him. And don&#x27;t act like learning where to put down his minefield is a difficult skill to master. It&#x27;s a basic ability.\n\nI disagree. He might not have amazing sexy outplays but he's all skillshots, has  a passive to manage which forces him to get closer range, has multiple terrain interactions and persistent abilities on the battlefield like EW (whose placement and choice to leave up or activate matters a lot) and he has an ult. which requires map awareness too and has multiple uses (waveclear, damage, zoning etc.). The myriad of uses for all his abilities makes him extremely high skillcap. \n\nHe doesn't have an enormous skillfloor like that of Azir but I think he's not easier to play optimally. Even in terms of game theory, the extreme amount of potential uses for each ability should make him difficult. He's certainly a lot harder than nearly every other mid champion I can think of, including Xerath. The reason is simply the options he has, and the somewhat persistent state of all his abilities. For example, even Q you can use for the short range more likely to hit option, you can use the long range variant to zone, you can throw it just at a wall edge if you want it to bounce over etc. For most champions, they just launch an ability and that's it, there's no real need to think about it stikcing to the battlefield 10 seconds like Ziggs E or whether to choose between damage, zoning, knockback, knocktowards, etc with W. This is why his skillcap is so high, there are always so many things you could be thinking about. It's not just aiming. He has a lot more strategic depth in how he'd ideally think about and use his abilities.\n\nWith that said, I think he is terribly rewarded for his high theoretical skillcap. He's not a hypercarry like Azir and nor is he reliable like Annie. There's little reason to pick him objectively (turret taking is currently more of a snowball mechanic rather than a comp. requirement). I think the reason you don't see how high of a skillcap he has is because you are thinking of his skill floor. A relatively weak player can still be useful and the optimizations of the best Ziggs do not make an enormous difference (unlike Riven for instance). Most champions with this much theoretical complexity, will reward a player more handsomely when they think about the kit very wel. He's a bit like Ezreal in this regard. Ezreal is also a quite high skillcap champion despite not having a crazy high skill floor. Moreover, Ezreal also isn't usually sufficiently rewarded to justify picking even if you are great at him. (with the exception of this particular patch) ","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"when your","date":"2017-11-19T11:41:51.783+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ahri, annie, lux are good to help you get a hang of the mid game i think","replies":[]},{"poster":"YambrinZ","date":"2017-11-19T10:40:39.207+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Annie is the freelo \"i just wanna win and climb\" pick.
