I clicked on the link thinking \"oh, someone might actually have a legitimate complaint about the system and share similar thoughts on the subject.\" Nope, just a classic case of butt hurt.\n\nYour post lacks details on why you think these players trolled you. Nasus for example. We don't know his match up, we don't know if he was getting camped hard, we don't know if he had some major lag issues, we don't know if the jungler out right refused to help him, we just don't know. So you crying about how bad he is doing isn't a legitimate reason to think he's a troll, unless you provide some other form of proof. If he was really that bad of a player report him for being unskilled and it'll drop his MMR and he'll be placed with players of similar caliber. As for Lee...He's not obligated to gank lanes, or more importantly to **WIN YOUR LANE**. The less you rely on the jungler the better, the less you heckle the jungler too will be better. A general rule I have kept is if a lane is losing by 2 or 3 more deaths, then me going  there would just be me feeding the fire unless I'm also heavily fed. That and if someone in lane is giving me attitude on how I'm jungling, I usually ignore them and help others that need it. Raging at your jungler is probably the dumbest thing you could do. It's like pissing off your friend who's giving you a ride to work. With that being said, if Lee had five deaths but didn't get counter jungled, then it seems like he actually did attempt to gank, probably early and it didn't work out, so if he's just farming creeps, he's trying to play catch up and stay relevant in the game. Your whole post on how these players are trolls lacks any sort of details as to why other than that they played poorly. My suggestion is to kick your ego and the crappy attitude you have and you'll more than likely do better. Hate players such as you that blame everyone else and think they deserve a better tier.\n\nI do agree with the headline of the post though. Trolls have waaaaaaay too much power in the game and can single handily effect the match five minutes in, whether they feed lanes intent, afk, or whatever. It's even more asinine that players who actually do rage and fight back against these trolls are actually more likely to get banned, which is utterly stupid. Chat shouldn't even be a problem, there's a mute button in the game, use it, if they're being toxic and ruining the game for you, chances are they won't contribute anything more in chat, so just mute them and communicate with pings, it's pretty simple. Personally, being banned because of whatever is said in chat is probably the dumbest thing you could get banned for when there's literally a way to block it.\nAnd please, don't feed me the line \"But it's a game! It's meant to be fun!\" So is football, soccer, golf and every other sport out there, they're all considered games and they're all, like league, competitive. I play the game to have fun and to also be competitive. You can take a guess which options I use to play competitively and which I use to be casual. Imagine your favorite football team is the Patriots, and Tom Brady is being a dick because his offensive line said his wife looked better with red hair, so he just tosses the game and refuses to throw the ball. Wouldn't you be pretty pissed off at Brady? I don't even know how or why this is a major issue in league. The games been around for years, and I would think some level of moderation would have come into play by now. Do I have any solutions? Sadly, no. It's just something I would like to see fixed by the time season six rolls around.","replies":[{"poster":"NihIathak","date":"2015-10-06T20:10:39.947+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"*tries to start a slow clap*","replies":[]},{"poster":"62227164DEL1","date":"2015-10-08T23:41:38.617+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"SymbolicFear","date":"2015-10-08T23:53:22.222+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Jungler's are glorified supports unless they choose to be kid.

It's rather straightforward to identify. In addition, whole chat logs can be retrieved so it's less prone to have things misread or taken out of context.\n\nWith \"toxic play\" however, It's a much more blurred line.  Having your Nasus top with only 38 CS at 30 minutes while having such a poor score/build might not be toxic, but  it might just be honest to god poor play. Poor play isn't something that's  bannable, but it is something that the ELO system will handle naturally (By dropping their rank). \n\nThere are some clear cut actions such as AFKing via DC but that's already heavily punished. The other option of AFKing by remaining connected is much harder to regulate because there's nothing saying that they've done anything explicitly wrong. \n\nThis is why the player reporting system is so necessary: It's very difficult to separate poor play and actual toxic behavior.

If you're good enough anything works in normals, but if you're doing well in normals and you wanna try it in ranked then more power to you.  No offense but it's really not anyone's business how another person wants to play their champion if they believe that it works or if they want to experiment.  I have no problem with any build or any strat as long as the person doing it is putting in an honest effort to win.  It's not trolling if they're trying.  \n\nAnd at the end of the day unless you're making money off of playing league then it really is just for fun.
