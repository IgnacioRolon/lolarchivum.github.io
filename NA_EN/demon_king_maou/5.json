Trevenant, Litwick, and Drifloon are creepy. They don't want love - they want to murder you. Litwicks drain the life of the living nearby to feed their flame. Trevenant create labyrinths in their forests to get people lost until they die (note, Phantumps are the souls of dead children that got lost in the woods...), and Drifloons' prime directive is to haul children off to the underworld - something that is thwarted by them being unable to lift children.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"BLUELightning28","date":"2016-07-18T13:03:09.439+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You sure you want that mate?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sonicblaster33","date":"2016-07-18T12:58:10.652+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I dont want to get banned again","replies":[]},{"poster":"Swaid","date":"2016-07-18T19:58:18.513+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://67.media.tumblr.com/94f9ded77e7963f32356b4d17e5230c7/tumblr_nx8rg8jcdG1udh5n8o1_400.gif","replies":[]},{"poster":"LlamaOP","date":"2016-07-18T16:57:12.794+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://i.gyazo.com/a75a71be86862eae7da510190a4da884.png","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gentleman Gems","date":"2016-07-18T16:41:08.362+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://imgur.com/a/1j3Kr\nput it from my computer to my imgur, to here","replies":[{"poster":"Squidsmastah","date":"2016-07-18T22:30:36.205+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When did Lady Vashj become part of that movie?","replies":[{"poster":"Gentleman Gems","date":"2016-07-18T23:50:46.330+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When she wanted to trick the Naga Seawitch Ariana so she could steal her voice and marry Theramore Sailor Daric and take Theramore from the alliance and claim it for the Naga.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"AÃ­r","date":"2016-07-18T13:02:08.919+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"http://s2.quickmeme.com/img/21/21b1e6e63323f5fddcba53b5aa81c252a3e550d8e1f08a57373d916269ccb0bc.jpg","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kitty Darkstar","date":"2016-07-19T00:13:55.839+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Asagao Academy","replies":[]},{"poster":"RogueWill","date":"2016-07-18T21:29:42.653+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Miley Cirus' Flat Ass","replies":[]},{"poster":"D3m37r1","date":"2016-07-18T17:40:03.758+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://akanetsu.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/awsubs-amagi-brilliant-park-02-480p5e23e9c6-acefile-mkv_snapshot_04-01_2014-11-29_20-47-31.jpg\n\nDon't ask why.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Botifier","date":"2016-07-18T17:21:48.835+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"k\nhttp://i.imgur.com/CeNUTpD.png","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mymyamiaou","date":"2016-07-18T14:53:08.493+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0efbf7055a36b5342e725a4faa6ec303/tumblr_ns4mye1cdE1s6rdono1_500.gif\n\nI have this and many more in my possession.","replies":[{"poster":"GaleWinUnleashed","date":"2016-07-18T15:21:32.511+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kimbley!\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/1HvNiEO.png?noredirect","replies":[{"poster":"Mymyamiaou","date":"2016-07-18T15:52:18.977+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Jojo! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zZlQ1WSn5U","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Blue Moon Wolf","date":"2016-07-18T15:35:42.782+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't have much since I just recently did a data dump to my portable hard drive (gonna have to by a new computer soon.
