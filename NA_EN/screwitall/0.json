Packet loss is when a percentage of the packets of data you send get lost along the way to the servers. These packets are crucial because they are bits of information that tell the server which actions you are meaning to take (cast an ability, move your character, interact with a creature or champion) and if they get lost or delayed, it can create big problems for you.\n\nOur [connection troubleshooting guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) goes over the most common solutions for packet loss. Let me know if those steps helped you with this issue.","replies":[]}]}
