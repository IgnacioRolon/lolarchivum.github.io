At this point everybody is high strung and my midlaner starts using racial slurs and at this point all I can do is laugh. Anyways here's the chat log but I REALLY don't understand how I said anything worth banning me over.

I'd rather not have them play in future games if they're gonna act like this\". While I get you were frustrated and angry over the situation the behavior you displayed in the game did absolutely nothing to help the situation and only made things worse for all involved. If you stopped using deragatory tears then great, but you can still be rude and disrespectful and act up without using them, and there are plenty of examples in PB of people who didn't use any swear words or derogatory terms but still got in trouble for behaving poorly. You should also know by now that other people behaving poorly does not give you a free pass to do the same.\n\nThat aside think about it: trolls and griefers do what they do because they want a negative reaction out of people. If you don't give them that kind of reaction then chances are they'll either stop what they're doing and actually behave/play properly (not always but sometimes) or they'll just dig themselves a deeper hole than they already are.\n\nAs for the person who was trying to avoid being punished for AFK the system is smart enough to tell if someone is trying to do that and has punished people for attempting to avoid detection.\n\nOverall this is a fair and valid punishment. In the future if someone is acting up in chat then mute/ignore them, report them and move on. If they're acting up via gameplay then do your best to play around their behavior while also making sure to report them after the game. If you do need to vent then you can try non in-game methods, such as yelling/raging at the screen, punching a pillow, squeezing a stress ball or even typing in a Word document or something. These will allow you to vent without fear of dragging your team down or putting your account at risk of punishment for poor behavior.","replies":[{"poster":"Lefsa","date":"2019-08-10T19:11:00.209+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Yeah the thing is the game was so unfortunate that I genuinely didn't think anything I said could get me upset because I wasn't that emotionally invested in the game.

As for your other points: \n\n1) Being competitive doesn't automatically mean that it's okay to insult and harass others. People do receive punishments in professional sports (esports included) for unsportsmanlike conduct in the form of fines and/or suspensions/bans. You're not being competitive if you behave like that: you're just being an immature jerk. Take pro LoL player Dardoch for example: he's a good player but he was moved from team to team due to his consistently poor behavior, which ended up overshadowing his skills at the game. He did eventually improve his behavior after joining Echo Fox but the fact remains that you can be as good at the game as you want, but if you have a reputation for behaving poorly then it can eventually overshadow your skill. I'm a competitive person myself but even I recognize that there's never a good reason to abuse and harass others.

Too many of these people can drive people away from the game, which in turn means a loss of potential revenue for Riot. Because of that it's actually in their best interest to promote a fun and enjoyable environment while telling those who don't want to do that to just take a hike and find another game to play.\n4) Other people \"behaving worse\" is not a valid excuse for your own poor behavior.

That's unfortunate, and I'm sorry you had to deal with it. If this misbehavior happened in chat (including emotes or ping) and they don't respond positively to a _single, courteous, constructive request to focus on the game_, your best option is to mute that player. Submit a report after the match. This is equivalent to dealing with a noisy person in a library by asking them to keep it down and then notifying library staff and moving to another area.\n\n_Do not respond with misbehavior of your own!_ If you do that, your teammates may mute and report _you_, and those reports would be valid. This is equivalent to dealing with a noisy person in a library by getting into a shouting match with them. Just because someone else started it doesn't justify you in continuing it. I'm sure you're familiar with the \"s/he started it\" trope, where two children get into an argument or fight and then try to claim innocence of any wrongdoing by claiming that they didn't instigate it. As any parent, teacher, or other supervisor of children will tell you, that excuse doesn't fly. When Dad is trying to drive you to Disneyland and your annoying brother starts making faces at you as he's previously been told not to, you should calmly ask him to stop, and then, if that doesn't work, calmly notify your parents of the problem. Making faces at him or shouting at him has never been a good way to get him to stop, and it makes you just as guilty of that as he.\n\nRiot doesn't care who started it. Someone else's misbehavior does not justify your own.\n\nFrom [Riot's support knowledgebase](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207489286-Instant-Feedback-System-FAQ-):\n\n> * Simply speaking, retaliation is not an acceptable or justifiable behavior. An argument between two players can easily create a negative experience for the rest of the players in the game with you. Regardless of the other player’s actions, this does not justify your own behavior. You alone are responsible for your actions within the game.If you encounter a toxic player like this, the best option is to simply report their behavior and move on.\n> * Reports are a vital piece to the puzzle. If you are not sure of what sort of behavior is reportable take a look at the [Reporting a Player FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752884-Reporting-a-Player)\n\nIf you misbehave but a teammate or opponent does or says something even worse, you should definitely report them after the match, just as someone reported you for your own misbehavior. Yes, that's certainly possible. Reports are not a limited resource. Any time someone believes that another player violated LoL's behavioral standards, they can report that player. Punishments are similarly not limited: if more than one player in a game merits a punishment, they can both get a punishment. This can happen even if the players in question were antagonizing each other. The IFS doesn't need to weigh the severity of all reported players' actions and then \"award\" the \"winner\" with a punishment; it's not a contest.\n\nThink of it like dealing with a noisy person in a library: ask them to keep it down, and then notify library staff and move to another area if that doesn't work. If you get into a shouting match with them, you're just as likely to be removed, even if you weren't shouting _quite_ as loudly as they were. The goal is a quiet library.\n\nYou weren't punished for misbehaving in one game. You were punished for misbehaving in _one more_ game, in a consistent pattern of negative behavior that breaks the game's rules. Additionally, the reform card doesn't always show all the logs that led to your punishment: it randomly selects up to several logs. You might see three logs, but you also might see as few as one, even for players whose punishment stems not from a small number of egregious infractions but rather from dozens of instances of mild toxicity. The purpose of the reform card is to tell you how to reform, so it shows you an example of the behavior that prompted your punishment and explains that such behavior is inappropriate and should be avoided if you want to maintain an account in good standing.\n\nUsually, one transgression by itself wouldn't be enough to bring such a punishment to an otherwise clean account, but the IFS works on an escalating punishment system. Breaking a minor rule, like engaging the team in useless arguments, has a minor punishment: a chat restriction. Breaking that same rule over and over again, however, doesn't prompt an endless series of chat restrictions. The severity of the punishment ramps up over time, because the goal is to eliminate the punished player's willingness to break the game's rules. If two chat restrictions don't stop the useless arguments, the system will increase the punishment to a 14-day suspension and deliver a very clear message that the continued rule-breaking is becoming a serious issue and any further instances will result in a permaban. Again, the point is to put a stop to this misbehavior. If a player is more interested in repeatedly breaking the rules than in maintaining access to their account, they'll lose access to their account.\n\nOf course, it's possible to break major rules, like cheating, threatening people, or using chat for hate speech, and skip punishment tiers so that a clean account ends up with a 14-day suspension or even a permaban.\n\nFrom [Riot's support knowledgebase](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207489286-Instant-Feedback-System-FAQ-):\n\n> **PUNISHMENTS GENERALLY FOLLOW A BASIC ESCALATION PATH:**\n> \n> * First Offense: 10 Game Chat Restriction\n> * Second Offense: 25 Game Chat Restriction\n> * Third Offense: Two Week Suspension\n> * Fourth Offense: Permanent Suspension\n> \n> However, it is possible to skip to a Two Week or Permanent suspension based on the severity of the behavior in the game. Excessive negative behavior can result in a Two-Week or Permanent suspension at any time without having a chat restriction on the account.\n\nFrom [Riot's support knowledgebase](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752884-Reporting-a-Player):\n\n> Do not threaten or repeatedly tell a player you will report them. Doing so can encourage players who are already negative to continue their behavior. Whether they know they are being reported or not has no bearing to whether the system will act on them. But most importantly, repeatedly threatening or arguing with a negative player can end up derailing the game for everyone else and then open yourself up to reports and possible disciplinary action as well. Avoid negative thoughts and useless chatting with poor performing teammates! Focus on victory by muting the offending player and then reporting them at the end of the game.\n> \n> Do not ask other players in the match to report the offending player. It only takes one report for our systems to review a game. Additional reports will not do anything for the offending player; however as mentioned above, it could open yourself up to a report of your own; especially if you are derailing the match by constantly demanding reports of other players.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lefsa","date":"2019-08-10T10:53:13.121+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"The game in question is the second to most recent on my account by the way.","replies":[{"poster":"zPOOPz","date":"2019-08-10T11:54:49.251+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How many games/chat logs are you in feedback card?","replies":[{"poster":"Lefsa","date":"2019-08-10T19:08:26.119+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"just this one.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
