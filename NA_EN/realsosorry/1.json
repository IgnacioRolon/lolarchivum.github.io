I spent more than 600 bucks and don't want to start over in Korea.\r\nPlease let me know soon.\r\n\r\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-18T01:43:52.513+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Due to how the Korean/Garena servers differ from the rest, we don't have any way to transfer the account to KR or transfer the content. There's always a *chance* that we might be able to open up a special type of transfer again, like we did when that server was first created, but I don't have any information on that right this moment.\n\nSide Note: I wanted to mention that I understand how much this might suck to hear. I'm going to do my best to reach out to some people to see if there's anything at all that can be done, but at this point we won't be able to transfer that account.","replies":[{"poster":"RealsoSorry","date":"2017-08-18T18:21:42.486+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The thing I don't understand is that you guys actually are able to transfer the account from NA to Japan, and some other regions that lately open.\n\nBut you guys cannot transfer our account from NA to the regions that already opened for so long,,,\n\nWould you guys please go and discuss about it real quick? People spent so much money and time on League,,\n\nAs people may live and move to other regions, it should be very downfall for this game.\n\nIt's a very disappointing point for the game even though I love this game, this problem should be fixed real quick","replies":[{"poster":"kingkangstar","date":"2017-11-16T03:13:05.501+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can't say for sure, but I think it is because of Korea's special law about any online account needing to be connected to one's korean social security number. This was a law that was put in to deter cyber bullying, however, there were recent push backs because it is apparently anti-free speech since one can't stay anonymous online, so maybe it will change in the future. \n\nI'm traveling to Korea to see my family for a bit, and I'm finding out some interesting thing about their online laws while I was googling how to transfer my account. I wanted to honestly do a bit of ranked training boot camp, but I guess I can't lol :c","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"RealsoSorry","date":"2017-09-11T14:24:04.442+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi, I am still wondering if you guys still are not able to transfer my account from NA server to KR server since I have been suffering playing league without any skins and such narrow champ selects,, hope you guys are working on it","replies":[]}]}]}
