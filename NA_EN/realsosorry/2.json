I have this problem for about 2weeks so far.\r\n\r\nMy champ is unresponsive often when I click so many times of my mouse.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't move, and my internet and chat everything else is completely fine.\r\n\r\nI have seen some discussion in Reddit and here, some people have same problem and Riot still not figured out.\r\nThe discussions were about 2years ago and it still happens, what is that..\r\n\r\nI am using mac pro btw. Please fix it or let me know some ways to fix it.\r\n\r\nIt absolutely makes me unplayable.\r\n\r\nP.S. I think it should be a part of packet loss, but it's not the exactly same since my minions and other players seem work very well and smoothly. Also, I can see my mouse cursor that I intended to move, but just my champ didn't move at all occasionally.\r\n\r\nAny ideas?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-14T22:51:43.755+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This certainly does sound a lot like [*Packet Loss*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_loss), which happens when some of the data packets your computer sends to the servers are lost along the way.
