I was playing very poorly and was saying stuff like &quot;wow noob jg no ganks&quot; which I know may seem bad, but I knew I was playing bad and I didnt actually mean it. This guy knew I was joking, but the other members of my team didn&#039;t, and they might have reported me, idk. Anyways, I queue up and next thing I know, I&#039;m permabanned! Even if I was being serious, this is the first time i&#039;ve ever gotten banned before, ever. I don&#039;t think it should be as serious as a permaban, plus I didn&#039;t even mean what I was saying. If this get&#039;s enough replies, I&#039;ll get my friend to send a message and show a chat log of what happened. I&#039;ve had this account for 3 years and I don&#039;t want to lose it.","replies":[{"poster":"PyroLux","date":"2016-08-15T20:09:24.282+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":9,"body":"My Chatlog:\nGame 1\nPyroLux: INVAD\nPyroLux: U PUSSY KOG\nPyroLux: KS\nPyroLux: WHERES THE SHEILD\nPyroLux: U FUC\nPyroLux: F\nPyroLux: DAS\nPyroLux: AD\nPyroLux: DSA\nPyroLux: DA\nPyroLux: AD\nPyroLux: ASD\nPyroLux: ADS\nPyroLux: im not flaming \nPyroLux: ive said nothing\nPyroLux: wut?\nPyroLux: NOOB JG NO GANKS (This was 20 minutes in, lmao)\nPyroLux: KOG UR A FEEDR\nPyroLux: stfu aleks\nPyroLux: who fed ashe\nPyroLux: dude u suk\nif it's been updated, op.gg should show a draven game with me and their is a player in the game named \"aleks the dead\" who I know in real life.

Even if you are speaking to someone that is ok with that, you have to be considerate of the other players; regardless of whether they are the target it often creates a negative experience for them, or they may even report you for the sake of the other players.\n\nAt the very least, have your friend let the other players know you are both ok with it, but if they still don't appreciate it you should cut it out. I recommend using third party communication options so that it stays isolated from the other players (such as speaking over Skype).\n\nIf you wish to contest the ban you'd need to submit a [Support Ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).","replies":[{"poster":"dominusx","date":"2016-08-15T19:49:12.385+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":14,"body":"so you are telling me i cant trashtalk my friends because someone is butthurt and thinks i'm toxic? seems legit. next thing we gonna get banned for talking in other languanges outside english.

If you don't mind behavior like that from other players that's ok, you don't have to report it, but the rest of the community typically doesn't want to deal with it.
