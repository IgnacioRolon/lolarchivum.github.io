Do you think the following ultimate would be better suited for her? :\r\n\r\nKatarina channels for 0.75 (or 1 sec) seconds (similar to the edge of night channel - she can move, but damage will cancel the ult and put it on a short 5 sec CD) and throws 3 knives to the 3 closest enemy champions (or to one champion if there is no other enemy champion nearby). After x seconds a dagger spawns behind every hit enemy champion. An enemy hit by more than 1 knife takes reduced damage from every other knife.\r\n\r\nThat way she will have to rely on shunpoing to the daggers more, and have less damage on ultimate, but she will remain mobile. \r\nI am not sure how the numbers should change in order for her to be balanced, but I think the new ultimate itself will be better suited for her new kit.

Her ulti is meant to be her one weak point, the one time the enemy can counter her as to do damage she has to stand still.

The dagger mechanic also emphasizes you thinking ahead of time and setting up daggers where the fight is going to be so that you can pull off that big combo.\n\nShe's been made more strategic than before while also having a higher skill cap, but she's always relied on her mobility and timing to set up that ult.\n\nChampions have to have different parts of their kit do different things. Riven is a 'highly mobile champion' (all her dashes combined are less than the distance of one kat shunpo which resets like 3 times on one rotation, but go with me for a sec) but her w and ult have nothing to do with dashing, she already has enough dashing in the rest of her kit.","replies":[]}]}
