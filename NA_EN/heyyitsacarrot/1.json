I play like a sliver, and i don&#039;t climb because carrying toxic, really really toxic players is just impossible. I am tilting off the face of this earth and am going to quit league simply because it makes me more sad that i have to play with crap players. the vote down below is screwed up do don't bother.","replies":[{"poster":"DuskDaUmbreon","date":"2018-08-03T17:21:00.069+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's based on last year's rank because that's the best way to stop Diamond 2s and shit from being in the same games as Bronze 4s in early season.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LeftyRaydy","date":"2018-08-03T16:55:42.749+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know the struggle to fight out of bronze.
