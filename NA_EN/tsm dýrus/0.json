When I'm playing League, every game I just freeze, but it's not like connection problem, because I can see what others are doing in real-time. It's happening in fights mostly and I always get killed. I can't move, cant cast any spell etc... I dunno what to do... Thanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-12-16T17:41:24.421+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oof, it feels awful having that happen in the middle of a fight.  :(  Are you on Windows 10?  A recent update might have enabled your [Xbox Game Bar](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html) which has been known to cause freezing like this.  Let me know if disabling it does the trick!","replies":[]}]}
