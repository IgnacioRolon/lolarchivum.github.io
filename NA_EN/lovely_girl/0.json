So recently when I tried to launch the Legacy client, It'd shut me off every time so what i tried to do was uninstall, but now it wont work at all. When i open it, the icon appears for 1 sec and then it instantly says something went wrong while opening it so I tried doing it with Administrator and when it finished doing all its updates, It says \"League of Legends has encountered a problem. Please re-install League alpha client to try again later.\" Is there anything i can do to fix this?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-23T03:52:03.836+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The error you're running into usually means that something went really wrong during your reinstallation or patching process.
