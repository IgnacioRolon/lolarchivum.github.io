[Constantly]","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Past couple of weeks I'm having a strange disconnect from the chat issue. It's like every 2-3 minutes and my girlfriend gets it too with her laptop (connected to the same network, I'm with cable and she's with Wifi).\nI'm guessing the problem is with my modem or something like that but I have no idea how to fix this. I'm making this threat because I'm sure that I'm not the first who faces a problem like this and probably there is a fix out there I'm not aware of.\n\n[Screenshot 1](http://i.imgur.com/9eSSeQi.png)\n[Screenshot 2](http://i.imgur.com/ZP227fn.png)\n\n- I already have disabled the IP Helper (old threats suggested this).\n- I don't have disconnect issues with any other game.\n- I have a netgear modem (if this is important in any possible way).\n- I don't have disconnects issues with my girlfriends laptop when I'm connected to other wifi networks.\n\nThank you very much guys, I appreciate any help.\nGeorge","replies":[{"poster":"Mashud Siddque","date":"2017-07-13T16:34:58.940+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Having same problem form patch 7.14 update...riot need to fix this problem as soon as possible","replies":[]},{"poster":"romanstrid","date":"2017-05-11T19:02:49.844+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It happens to me to please help me","replies":[]},{"poster":"Amaris","date":"2016-10-04T16:04:20.463+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I now have the same issues since some days.
