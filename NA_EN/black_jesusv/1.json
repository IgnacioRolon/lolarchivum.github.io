It&#039;s upsetting that kids make it anywhere. I&#039;m currently gold 2, with platinum elo i&#039;ve been told and people are nothing more than sensitive to the words &quot;nerd, fk, wtf, shut up&quot;. My friend recently got banned and he isn&#039;t coming back, in person, he is the sweetest guy on earth who legitimately wouldn&#039;t even tell a dear friend to &quot;be quiet&quot;.\n\nI&#039;m here because players have reported me or said &quot;i&#039;m reporting you&quot; for offensive conduct as of me saying &quot;shut up&quot; *when they ping you 234523 times, but you know what you&#039;re doing. Or the classic, WTF which is a result as in what happened, or how did that happen kind of moments. I&#039;ve been told that i&#039;m toxic beyond belief for 0 cuss words, and nothing derogative, I just have different view points of the game. Looking at the graphs, i&#039;m already better than 70% of the community, and i feel allowed to have different viewpoints.\n\nSo my question is, why are people such big babies and want to get people banned so badly? Are those phrases above REALLY offensive? If yes, then what is the line? Do i have to talk players like i&#039;m talking to Dora the explorer? Seriously what is the line for &quot;bad behavior&quot;. I&#039;m 200$ deep into the game, spend a lot of hours, and I simply CANNOT figure out what DOESN&#039;T trigger people. I feel it&#039;s best to just turn my chat off everygame?\n\nDoes Riot truly look at the offences and believe that these words are toxic? Can't the player who falsely reported these be banned or muted themselves? this is a joke.","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-07-09T23:29:10.796+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"> My friend recently got banned and he isn't coming back, in person, he is the sweetest guy on earth who legitimately wouldn't even tell a dear friend to \"be quiet\".\n\nI'd really like to see the reform card for this friend of yours :3\n\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/70f6fe4ab8d0d5f370517d3a105c7780.png","replies":[{"poster":"DoctorWolf18","date":"2016-07-09T23:41:38.183+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I kinda just want to pay you now to make a picture for me lol.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CrazFight ","date":"2016-07-09T23:40:19.712+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Deep Terror Nami,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=ovF5imTh,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-07-09T23:29:10.796+0000)\n>\n> I&#x27;d really like to see the reform card for this friend of yours :3\n> \n> https://i.gyazo.com/70f6fe4ab8d0d5f370517d3a105c7780.png\n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ XD","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cyst","date":"2016-07-10T04:55:28.183+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Isn't it more fun now you don't have to watch your what you say?\n\nThe only blue thing is riot saving money on automating response on forum ;)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"WunThousandOurs","date":"2016-07-10T00:37:13.254+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Contrary to popular belief, the entire banning process is automated.
