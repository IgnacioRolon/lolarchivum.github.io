I myself know some stuff about the game, season 4 I was diamond, but I never had a teacher, and I honestly have no idea how to get someone into the game. She knows the basic stuff such as AD, AP.\r\n\r\nI was wondering if there&#039;s anything else I should introduce her to, or should she just keep playing and learn it herself eventually?","replies":[{"poster":"Shes Gone Now","date":"2016-01-11T10:35:58.151+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would look up some videos on YouTube as they are pretty informative and easy to digest. There are a lot of vague concepts in league that only feeding 20 games can teach you. Just remember it's not her fault shes feeding. If she was playing against people of equal skill level then it would be a better learning environment, but she is probably fighting smurfs.","replies":[{"poster":"Boobless Fiora","date":"2016-01-11T10:54:53.119+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know it's not her fault, of course, she gets sad each time she dies, and I'm 300% sure she is playing against smurfs. I always tell her it's okay, but they flame her so much, and she won't listen to me when I tell her to mute them :D I'll just let her play and eventually she'll learn","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Darkmind1212","date":"2016-01-11T11:02:15.635+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well a big thing about league is learning what the champions do and how to use/avoid the abilities...you know...all 400 or so of them...Yeah maybe my idea isn't the best.","replies":[]}]}
