Got a live stream playing in the background, and a skype call on) After closing out of my client and logging back in, I couldn't reconnect; instead I could start an entirely new game.

The game should act as if it never existed, so it shouldn't impact your stats.  I don't have any updates or info to share right now, but I appreciate the report!","replies":[]}]}
