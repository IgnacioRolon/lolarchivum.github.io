I'm a US Army Veteran, who during this past year...unfortunately, like many of our enlisted out there, had to deal with some very real issues. Combat PTSD, is something that affects soldiers, their families, and everyone around them. \r\n\r\nFortunately with the help of my wife, my local VA, and people I met through this game, I have been able to start to piece thing together again. \r\n\r\nDuring the interim, I tilted 3000+ games. WHY COULDNT I JUST DO NORMALS? \r\n\r\nAnyways, long story short, I have..significant funds allocated into this account, and I would, LOVE LOVE LOVE a way to \"Transfer\" over the content here to a new account. Because quite frankly, my presence in a game, (when a player on the other team finds out) how many games played...it creates..some interesting games needless to say. \r\n\r\nI just want to play the game like anyone else. Was playing 3k+ games the healthy thing to do? Absolutely not. Could I have done some things worse? You bet. Did I meet some great people. Check. Would I do it all over again? Not a chance in hell. \r\n\r\nSo please Rito, help me!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-10T20:54:06.118+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Transferring content to a new account isn't something we can typically do, but I'd like to talk more about what's going on in those games to see if I can find some other way to help!

I'd say at least 40% of the games, I get asked it in all chat. I tend to usually ignore it, or if its a team mate, use that time to plug my stream (which I donate 100% of proceeds to veteran based charities) \n\nPut it this way, open up any recent game replay of mine. Seriously, just watch for yourself. I can't emphasize, how much it changes the game dynamic quite often.","replies":[]}]}]}
