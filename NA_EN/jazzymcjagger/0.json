She&#039;s loud, obnoxious, all over the place, over the top cartoonish, and straight up doesn&#039;t even belong in League. The word, &quot;Disney Princess,&quot; comes to mind for a little to mind for a lot of people. \r\n\r\nAnd while I respect other people&#039;s opinions and likes and dislikes, I finally found the specific reason why I truly love Zoe as a champion, and it&#039;s because she reminds me of Ed.\r\n\r\nIf you don&#039;t know Cowboy Bebop, I understand if you don&#039;t know who Ed is, but for those who do, she&#039;s truly a treasure. Cowboy bebop is an anime from the late 90&#039;s to early 00&#039;s, that was a part of many teenagers&#039; childhoods. All the characters were relatable, all of them felt well, like people. I can never truly explain how a television show, especially a cartoon, could make me feel, laugh, and even at one point, cry before. \r\n\r\nNow I know, im a weirdo because I cried at an anime lol, I know, funny right xd. But there&#039;s this character on the show, named Ed, that I truly loved growing up. I could never choose a favorite out of the 5 main characters of Cowboy Bebop since they all have a special place in my heart, but Ima dedicate this one to Ed. Ed is, well, in the show, Ed is a break from reality. Cowboy Bebop, while being a cluster of multiple genres, keeps a consistent noir tone throughout the show, which can really drag you in and never let go in the show, though Ed was a refreshing break from all the breakneck action. The second time I ever actually cried at a t.v. show was when Ed and Ein (Spoiler Alert) leave to go on their own journey. I was never more emotionally saddened, and how subtle the other characters deal with their loss really impacts you. I loved Ed and Ein, I still do, though it really saddened me to see them go at the time :( . \r\n\r\nBut then. A mage came along. \r\n\r\nI always loved league characters, they&#039;re probably my favorite aspect of league, and of course I was excited to see the new champion added to the roster, but when I saw Zoe, my face lit up like a Christmas tree. She was everything I could imagine from a goofy little girl like Ed. While you can&#039;t draw dozens of parallels, I see a few resemblances between the two, and it really made me smile. :D\r\n\r\nSo uh, yeah, that&#039;s why I actually enjoy Zoe as she is. I truly respect if you don&#039;t like her, you probably have good reason to, but I wish you enjoyed my reasons for liking Zoe.  :)","replies":[{"poster":"Reav3","date":"2018-09-06T17:05:58.849+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":8,"body":"Ed from Coboy Bebop was actually one of the references (Of many) that we used for Zoe :)","replies":[{"poster":"Spideraxe","date":"2018-09-06T17:10:09.843+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Reav3 can I ask for your thoughts on how successful Zoe was as a whole package since it seems like her gameplay has a very high frustration bar but her art and theme also score really high","replies":[{"poster":"Reav3","date":"2018-09-06T18:13:16.436+0000","up_votes":57,"down_votes":51,"body":"Overall I find Zoe to have been very successful.

Yasuo isn't frustrating because of his ubiquity (And he's not even that ubiquitous), he's frustrating because of his theoretically infinite mobility and eventually he can and will right click you to death and there's nothing you can do about it and god forbid you're playing mages into him, he can press W and just temporarily render your champion(s) irrelevant for a few seconds. \n\nWait, why am I telling a Riot employee this?

It introduced one good mechanic (E's reset) that made the champion both more satisfying to play with (triggering that reset feels good) and fair to play against (as it justifies lower damage numbers, thus less front-loaded damage and more time for the opponent to react), and the update also reduced his ultimate's damage in order to promote more ramp-up time (which ended up being reverted for being unsatisfying and causing frustration problems elsewhere). Yet, for all the good steps taken further, a few more were backwards. His new passive shield, even if incredibly useful, is boring and uninteractive both for the Malz player and their opponent, and the higher reliance on voidlings gave the champion too much additional strengths (tower-breaking and being able to farm at a larger distance, thus countering one of his traditional counters: artillery mages) through a mindless, AI driven mechanic that feels useless otherwise. Not to mention that said boing AI mechanic and said boring shield passive have been the justification for damage nerfs (because, apparently, Riot thought those boring mechanics deserved to keep their ridiculous high power budget, while shaving the pwoer down of his more interesting skills), ultimately leading to a downward spiral that turned him into a safe-to-play and boring flash+ulti bot.\n\nI'm happy that Zoe is getting an update, but I'm equally sad that Malzahar is not popular enough to get a similar and equally deserving update.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Academy Kayn","date":"2018-09-06T18:27:19.423+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":3,"body":"That's my personal experience with Xerath.

The power creep in the game is just fucking absurd at this point. Literally any new champ/remake, it's safe to assume is and/or will be busted. This trend existed since season 5. Like, you guys release shit, overtune it, then pat yourself on the back and say \"it's popular, go is!\" As if people love it for any other reason than abusing something that is explicitly, by design, made to be overpowered. It's such a fucking joke at this point!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Demonblade Talon","date":"2018-09-07T02:43:35.846+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Reav3,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=RKIu7Kci,comment-id=000200010000,timestamp=2018-09-06T18:13:16.436+0000)\n>\n> Overall I find Zoe to have been very successful. She is one of more popular mages and despite some people finding her theme/personality annoying, many people love her and connect wit her theme. I also value that she feels different and stands out in our cast. When you look at our entire roster she stands out and adds a lot to the roster imo. She can be frustrating to play against, but that only one aspect of many that goes into a champions success, and often times a Champions popularity contributes towards the communities perception of a Champion, which is something CertianlyT Champions can suffer from. When a Champion is popular you play against it a lot so it can make that Champion seem more frustrating then a Champion that might actually be more frustrating to play against but you rarely ever see it in games.\n\nShe might be frustrating to play against but that can be said about literally every champion. In fact, Veigar is way worse than her..\nThe style I think is what draws a lot of people in and just how fun the kit is. It all flows together perfectly. \nPeople were waiting for a cute loli style champ forever (not to sound like a weirdo) and we don't have many. It's kinda like how we only have 1 katana user, 1 scythe user, 1 spear user, etc.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dazerth","date":"2018-09-06T19:30:56.220+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly I dont expect you to answer this but I'll ask you anyways, what is your perspective on Nidalee atm ?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Blood Magicks","date":"2018-09-06T17:25:45.808+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My boyfriend also said she looked a lot like Peter Pan.

Peter Pan is one of the classic tricksters and an iconic symbol for the archetype--  so he is 100% in Zoe but because it is one of the sources of this archetype (along with Loki) I instead looked for reinterpretations of it for the moodboard.  I think I ended up with a picture of young Bjork dressing up as peter pan on there.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"N1eR","date":"2018-09-12T15:14:21.642+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello.

I don't play her, I think her kit is (mildly) annoying, and her personality is subjectively cringy (that's not necessarily a bad thing).
