Even for a trained master, they can't manage more than a few cuts before things like blood, scratches on the edge, cracks on the blade, etc force the user stop and resharpen the blade.\n+ Swords cannot generate tornados.\n+ A human cannot instantly dash behind an opponent.\n+ A human cannot keep a person off the ground for an entire second with just the upward force of a sword slash as the blade is designed to be thin/sharp enough to smoothly separate atoms from atoms with minimal resistance. A slash capable of lifting a person off the ground would require an enormous amount of resistance from the object being slashed to use as an opposing force against the coming force of the blade to then transform the energy from the slash into a physical upward force but at that point it wouldn't be 'cutting', it'd be closer to 'smashing' and that's not what a sword is designed to do.
