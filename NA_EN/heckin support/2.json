It's just like how if you look at legendary skins like Ice Toboggan Corki, Alien Invader Heimerdinger, The Magnificent Twisted Fate, ect.. they have no recalls, no new particles, No new voice over but are still classed as Legendary.\n\nReally doubt they will ever go back over most of the skins and add anything special unfortunately.
