I tried the solutions that they provide but they don't work at all. However, I do notice that I don't have  Visual C++ 2005 SP1 installed before, therefore I use DirectX to fix it. I think it should be OK after I got it installed. However, the same problem still exists. I tried to go to Microsoft's website and download the  Visual C++ 2005 SP1 Redistributable straightforward but same thing happen again!\r\n\r\nI checked some discussion before and I found some cases are similar to me but not the same. Their solutions are not working for me.\r\n\r\nI am so confused right now because there are so many different solutions in there and I can't do all of it. If some one met the same problem and fixed it, I want to know how to solve it.\r\nPlease help me, I want to play this game so hard!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-18T21:56:45.805+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You do need to make sure you have Visual C++ installed before League will work properly.
