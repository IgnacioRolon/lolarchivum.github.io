When I click on the launcher, the logo shows up then I get an error message. I tried uninstalling then reinstalling the game, but now it will not let me even download the game from the website. I am relatively computer savvy, but this has stumped me and I really want to play. Any ideas?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-20T18:38:05.429+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hit us up through a [support ticket ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and we can take a closer look for you.
