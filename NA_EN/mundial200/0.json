There have also been multiple threads explaining what the issue is. No one has a PC problem, its something wrong with the new patch that affected a part of the community. \n\nThing is, that RIOT has not responded to this after so much time. Not even inform us that they will look into it.","replies":[{"poster":"DraygenBiscuit","date":"2018-06-04T14:04:19.071+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=LP Pale Ale,realm=EUNE,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=cIvauoEt,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2018-06-04T14:00:30.761+0000)\n>\n> there is an issue with this since the day new patch came.
