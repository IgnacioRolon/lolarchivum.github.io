Make this happen - upvote.","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":22,"down_votes":26,"body":"So as we all know Zed is a trash tier champion for quite some time now , no I'm not talking about you goldies complaining he's insanely broken or something , talking about high elo players. Zed has been in a rough spot for years  with Riot seemingly unable to find a balance to his kit.\nToday we will see what defines Zed as an assassin and what his purpose is and how he should function in my opinion - also balance ideas that sound very good for balancing him in low and high elo at the same time.\n\nZed struggles versus armor severely. I'm talking literally even ninja tabi screwing him and with lethality being useless if you're not 2 levels ahead for effectiveness , it's hard to find a work-around to his either useless kit or dominating kit. I believe I have found a solution to it by adjusting the Following:\n\nReduce his ult base damage and scaling significantly > Therefore lower skilled players with the champion cannot oneshot others by a simple R E auto combo.\n**Add a new effect**: Whenever zed manages to hit a Shuriken (Q) Amplify the damage by a flat % (15-20% ex.) therefore rewarding players that can actually hit his abilities on the targets.\n**Add new effect**: If zed hits the target with ALL 3 Q's respectively , translating into 45-60% more ( based on following shurikens). dmg on ult > 30-40% of the damage deal is converted into true damage - giving Zed  a chance to win against armored or heavily armored opponents IF he hits his Q's(these numbers are just examples not actual chances , I'm sure riot will find the right math to it.)\n\nOther ideas - Reduce the damage on his Q slightly , but allow it to do bonus damage if he hits both of them , letting him duel his lane with actual skillshots that matter and reward him for good play. (I'm talking a slight bonus not insane damage)\n\nPlease give me feedback and upvote this so that hopefully Riot will address possible changes.{{champion:238}}  make Zed Great again , reward skilled players , punish bad ones.\nEDIT: His purpose is to destroy champions 1v1 , yet he can't do that due to all the armor , shields , zhonyas ,heals and all that.","replies":[{"poster":"The Ecdysiast","date":"2019-02-06T22:00:20.899+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"Except... it already works that way.

(Just a list of ideas, not suggesting add all of these lol)\n- Let Zed choose which way he appears out of his ult (hovering your mouse over which direction you want him to appear)\n- Buff Zeds energy refund for hitting more Q's, make him run out if he's missing but allow him to stay in fights if he's hitting his Q's, as I find energy to be a pretty big problem on him. \n- Give his ult a mutilator effect on his target (The one Aatrox passive gives, reduces shielding and healing by 45% on the target)\n- Revert ult cooldown buff, but decrease the cooldown on W. \n- Give his ult an effect that reduces target armor by a flat amount for the 3 seconds before the death mark pops. \nJust throwing some ideas around, I don't think he needs much damage increase as currently it's fine, he just needs some utility to make him a bit more viable. He also should not get any %armor reduction as that kind of just invalidates tanks, but rather get flat armor reduction to destroy squishies like he was designed too.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yenn","date":"2019-02-07T01:40:01.495+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Landing your Q's doesn't have anything to do with being a 'good' player.\n\nMelee mids and casters who need to get into auto range to CS cannot avoid Zed's W + E + Q combo, and it dumpsters 50-60% of their health. Zed does not need more reward for literally pressing all of his buttons at once just because someone got in range to hit a caster (or melee) minion.","replies":[{"poster":"0XFallen","date":"2019-02-07T22:34:06.107+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thats so wrong, late game perhaps but in early his full combo against melee in a wave does about 100 damage pre 6. also easy jukable combo , dodge 1 q and he wont deal anydmg without electrocute and cant even farm in lane for 22 seconds","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"PrinceOfStorms","date":"2019-02-07T06:21:06.360+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'd instead suggest to greatly increase Zed's damage from his shadow-mimicked abilities, but also greatly increase the energy cost of abilities in proportion to the number of shadows present (and give Zed an energy refund in proportion to the number of shadows that hit with the mimicked spell). That way if you're a good zed and land a full combo with 3 shadows you are basically guaranteed to delete your target. But if you whiff the Q for example you are suddenly out of energy and can't finish the combo.","replies":[{"poster":"0XFallen","date":"2019-02-07T22:31:58.451+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That only makes him worse in high elo.\nAlso you wont be even able to do a full combo with more costs.","replies":[{"poster":"PrinceOfStorms","date":"2019-02-08T11:13:29.154+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Also you wont be even able to do a full combo with more costs.\n\nNot if landing Q with all your shadows gave you a full refund.\n\nThe point is that if Zed is bad and whiffs his skillshots he can't do the full combo.
