She's clearly a support champion, but her kit is very strong and is being kept in a bad balance state right now until they figure out what to do with her, similar to Kalista. Yuumi's role % is like 95% support. Clearly a support champion. Sejuani is a jungler because if you look at the stats, her primary role is jungle because that's where she's played in like 90% of games shes picked. Pantheon is a weird one because he can be played in both top, mid and kind of jungle, but his kit is very pokey and if you look at professional players, very very few people play him jungle. Gragas is a jungler but hes ancient I'm not sure why you bring that up. \n\nAgain, i'm talking about a champion where it is CLEAR and OBVIOUS the champion was designed around jungling.","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-11-20T02:55:48.220+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Fear the Kayn,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=GAm3J1AE,comment-id=0001000100000000,timestamp=2019-11-19T22:08:47.231+0000)\n>\n> Yuumi is a champion that has intrinsic balance issues similar to Akali.
