Would it be entirely out of the question for Riot to setup an Old School server for players who prefer the game as it was in the Golden Age (most agree late Season 2). Jagex made an Old School server for Runescape and it basically saved the game. Would Riot do the same?","replies":[{"poster":"Rewt","date":"2018-03-06T03:55:11.527+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"First off. as much as people want to say that it is. League of legends isnt exactly dying.\n\nIts player base might be shrinking slightly, but its far from dwindling. And understand. this is a 9 year old game. most games shrink down to small dedicated fan bases after 2 years. But League of legends? no. in NA alone it has over 1m players at any given time, and im not talking about peak hours. \n\nAlso ive played in S2. And while everyone says \"oh it was so much better\" it wasn't. Lets be real here. They had just as many balance issues and things were completely useless and utterly broken. \n\nreally the only major changes since S2 are. Interesting champions have been released. Reworks have been done to make shitty old champions interesting and actually good. The game has become more team focused making solo carrying a bit harder. And the game pace has increased.\n\nLets take a look at S2 and tell you what you are getting if you go back there.\n\nS2 had a poorly defined jungle role. S3 was when it boomed. so you will get duo tops fairly regularly. Smite..... fuck dude it was single use with a 75s cooldown. it was nuts. Dragon was a flat 300 gold to your whole team. thats it. And baron was just a champ buff. Like half the items you enjoy in your kits today didnt exist. The game looked like ass. The banning phase was locked into first-third pick. Pick order was a thing so if you got last pick. guess what. You get to play support. And sometimes you would get last pick 4-5 games in a row. It felt even more shit than autofill. People held champ select hostage constantly and lets just be real here. There were a lot of just broken mechanics. Things just didnt work. League of legends had many more bugs back then than it does today.\n\nPlus for all you Lee Sin haters out there Lee sin was top dog by a mile. So hope you enjoy.\n\nAll in all. S2 was just as garbage as S8. just in different ways. So you can think \"oh the glory days\" but in reality. Its just an uglier, buggier, league of legends of old.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zane Zephyr","date":"2018-03-06T05:56:24.509+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They said they are open to considering it but it is far from a priority and they don't have the immense amount of resources it would take to make this a thing.\n\nhere is the article about it:\n\nhttps://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/2017/07/ask-riot-sexy-champs-and-butchers-bridge/","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hammermancer","date":"2018-03-06T04:36:01.241+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly The patch right before the juggernaut patch was the healthiest I ever remember league of legends, everyone was decently viable, only a few were too strong, but everyone could compete\n\nso like patch 5.0-5.15 range\n\nI seriously believe and uphold that this was the best I ever saw league of legends\n\nseason six was decent too.\n\nAfter they toned down the juggernauts but before the other class updates was maybe a close second in my experience","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-03-06T03:27:45.917+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Technologically way too complicated to be worth the effort for the tiny number of players that would play a static, old version with no balance or updates.","replies":[]}]}
