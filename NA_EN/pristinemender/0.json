At this point the launch scree disappears, but the login screen never shows up and when i click on anything or i try to bring up the task manager my whole computer freezes. I'm running windows 10 and i'm not sure if this is stems from the anniversary update (i believe i fixed that freezing issue) or if its lol itself causing my pc to freeze. If ya'll need the specs for my computer i can give them to you, but i've been running league for over 6 months without an issue till now.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-24T21:15:33.250+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When your client is having issues staying connected to our servers, it can cause your PC to freeze.
