Syndra also has 2 skins, why not give her more just like Diana, are Riot that bad at ideas that they can't make skins for all the champions and more fair.\n\nI main Diana and main mid, I want more skins to the mages and mid champs instead of all the usual champions getting skins and some players doesn't even like some of the new skins. \nRiot this is making me so bored that you always do like this. I have been waiting since forever after the Lunar Goddess came out, that was two years ago, what is the big deal? \nJust give them skins already or this will just be the reason for \"lameness\". Put your big ass brains together and give us something we want and are longing for and I know you can do it.\nLook at the champs that needs more skins and stop making skins for only Teemo, Katarina, Ashe, Xin zhao, Garen and all the other damn champs with 20 skins each... look for the ones that needs some instead. \n\nI love League of Legends and Riot are making something really awesome with it and I like that, this is the first game I ever played this much and I just can't think I will ever be able to let it go \n\nThanks for reading this and I don't think I'm the only one feeling like this about the skins\n-CC sweetheart EUNE \nNew skins for these champions: \n{{champion:131}} {{champion:134}} {{champion:238}} {{champion:268}}  {{champion:127}} {{champion:28}} {{champion:254}} {{champion:154}} {{champion:44}} {{champion:91}} {{champion:92}} {{champion:236}} {{champion:222}} ","replies":[{"poster":"Nagirah","date":"2015-03-14T22:17:19.885+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good message, bad examples.

The reason why certain champions have A LOT of skins (Teemo, Annie...) is because those skins sell often and A LOT.  That is what a good business done.\n\nIf you have 5% demand out of your player base for a particular skin, guaranteeing AT LEAST 50,000 purchases (just for example) or a unpopular champion who doesn't see much play with a 0.1% demand and only 1,000 if you are lucky???\n\nRemember, whether a skin sells a couple hundred or a few thousand, they put the same amount of work into them for that respective tier.

We can assume that some of these other skins we're seeing have been in the works around the same amount of time, more or less.
