I have just finished playing the new Resident Evil 2 remake, and I don't think I was ever more scared in a video game than when Mr. X surprised me as he came stomping after me in a Licker filled hallway. This isn't related to League, but I just wanted to demonstrate a moment where in a video game I actually felt the Fight or Flight responses IRL.\r\n\r\nMy question: what kind of horror theme are you channeling into new Fiddlesticks? Jump scares? Ambient fear? Unstoppable horror (like Mr. X)?  I know you probably can't wait to show us, and we can't wait to see it... but I was hoping for maybe a small hint.\r\n\r\nI'm really excited to play him, I enjoy playing champions that put \"fear\" into enemy players without actually using a fear mechanic. Warwick's ambient music chiming on when an enemy champion is below 50% HP, I friggin love that. You can sometimes see the apprehension in players when that dings on. I'm hoping Fiddlesticks is similar or better.","replies":[{"poster":"Kindlejack","date":"2020-01-28T19:29:24.071+0000","up_votes":39,"down_votes":3,"body":"Squad5 is targeting Fiddle's gameplay around being 'The premier ambush champion in LoL' which as I understand it means that, all other things being equal, it should win in situations where it gets the drop on opponents.

Exactly what i didn't want in my opinion. He is already useless in team fights, and getting hit my a cc while casting ult or after it is cast you pretty much die if you don't have zhoynas. He is the most team dependent heavy damage character in my opinion. Khazix can make a pick on an adc that steps up too far and kill them,and make it out because his mobility in teamfights. Rengar had quite a bit sustain and very high mobility. Ekko is the same way. All these are safer better options. Syndra jg is better than fiddle rn.  This turns him into another shaco, ok early game cheese and damage output, but really needs items to get anywhere.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Chembaron Yamada","date":"2020-01-28T18:48:50.861+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"My guess would be jumpscare.\n\nThey are keeping his ult, which already has the jumpscare effect if he unexpectedly blinks over a wall onto you for murder.\nAlso they said that they want to resolve his gameplay around \"you have to find the scarecrow before it finds you\". \n\nSo I guess Fiddlesticks gets some power if he manages to stay hidden for some time and then he will jump onto you out of nowhere and make you wet your pants.","replies":[]},{"poster":"QuZeed YT","date":"2020-01-29T10:35:06.445+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahhh, you don't know the fear of being low hp and you heart Pyke's W sound","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nøctμrne","date":"2020-01-28T20:29:16.274+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Sad Nocturne noises :(","replies":[]}]}
