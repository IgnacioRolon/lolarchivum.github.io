Warwick seems to be tied to Vi and Jinx's history, and I can't wait to see what kind of man Warwick was before his transformation. We know he was formerly a gangster who gave up his life of crime to live a better life, but what did he choose to do? Did he open a business? Did he help solve crimes in Zaun and hunt down the perpetrators? Was he a prize fighter?\r\n\r\nHis bio leaves a lot to be theorized, but I'd like to think he maybe served as an inspiration for Vi, who herself joined the Wardens. Maybe Warwick is a former gangster, became an investigator, hunted down the criminals who harmed his clients... and this was part of the catalyst that served as his motivations for his new chimeric transformation, who also hunts down the murderers of Zaun.\r\n\r\nThis is all speculation of course, but it just fuels my desire to watch the new show... which hopefully comes out soon!","replies":[{"poster":"Shmeeve","date":"2019-11-09T20:54:31.928+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"You know what would be very interesting to see in this show?\nUrgot.","replies":[{"poster":"TheMan292","date":"2019-11-10T01:24:44.373+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Manxxom,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=HEdr2803,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2019-11-09T20:54:31.928+0000)\n>\n> You know what would be very interesting to see in this show?\n> Urgot.\n\nI could see him as a very subtle cameo, working in the mines (whatever that lower level is called) and vaguely similar to the urgot he became.","replies":[{"poster":"Interlocutioner","date":"2019-11-10T04:28:23.055+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lowest level of Zaun = The Sump\nChem-mine prison that (once) held Urgot, below the Sump = The Dredge","replies":[{"poster":"Interlocutioner","date":"2019-11-10T04:47:44.363+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":0,"body":"Forgot one.\n\nUrgot = Urgot","replies":[{"poster":"Wînter Fox","date":"2019-11-10T14:49:13.263+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Urgot'em","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"YDy2ZkRq02","date":"2019-11-09T21:44:41.067+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Urgot is unlikely to appear.
