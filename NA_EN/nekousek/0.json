I just suck at searching on forums so here goes my problem. I played ranked today two times and both times i won, i got +10lp for each win (im sure im not in such ello hell to recieve such amount of lp) and enemy got -0lp, no afks nothing. So i wonder what is this ?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-28T22:36:40.273+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think enemy LP is visible in the post game screen, if you're looking this up on a third party site it could be inaccurate.  I looked at your recent match with Soraka and I see that you received LP (congrats on the promo to Gold!), while the enemy team accurate did lose a solid amount of LP.  I wasn't able to see anything out of the ordinary, but I hope that helps clear things up.","replies":[{"poster":"Nekousek","date":"2017-10-29T11:34:26.226+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"umm i know i can't see enemy lp  but they told us they didnt lose any lp at the end of both games so it cant be coinsidence and the third game, the promo one i got normal amount of lp.. these last 3 raka games in my history were okay but the other 2 were the +10 ones..","replies":[]}]}]}
