Than I went to play ranked game, client (old version) froze and i couldn't shut it down properly, nor start the new one. Apparently my team reported me because they had to remake, and now I have 5x20min low priority. One night after doing 5x10min low priority, also because of client crashes. Is there any chance I get my low priority queue lifted, because this is SERIOUSLY not fair. It's like doing prison time twice 'cause someone else committed murders. \nPS. I used Razer Cortex (game booster)","replies":[{"poster":"čovjek","date":"2017-04-15T20:23:58.437+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Another notice; fps is now what I can consider 'normal', but it changes with an amplitude of +/-70 fps (usually from around 90 to 220).","replies":[]}]}]}]}
