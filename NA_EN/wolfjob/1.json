If they are, honor them, because they have been exceptionally honorable.\n\nBeing a jerk should never be seen as acceptible... it's one thing to have clever trashtalking that's good natured between enemies. I've had games like that. There was one game where I was playing as Zyra against Sona, and I kept demolishing her and at one point I made the comment 'my favourite part about facing Sona is that she just can't say no'. The person playing Sona laughed and we had some banter throughout the game. That was the right type of 'trashtalk' because it was funny and it was in good nature...\n\nsaying 'gg ez' has no creativity, no humour, and is clearly in bad nature. That's the WRONG type of trashtalking. And it should not be encouraged. But if you want to banter with your opponents to get everyone into the game... then that's fine. Just at least put a BIT of thought into it and make it not directly insulting.","replies":[{"poster":"Digitality","date":"2015-03-06T20:21:57.344+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":8,"body":"The only time I bother with trash talk is to create an advantage.

I won't bother reading it but someone else might and it would be a courtesy to them. You are going to blindly argue your side regardless of evidence or common sense so there is no point continuing this exchange. Have a good night... or don't.

There is nothing positive that \"ez\" adds to the community. Belittling an opponent is against the Summoner's Code, that we ALL agree to abide by for a civil and constructive environment. \"6 Show Humility in Victory, and Grace in Defeat\" most glaringly is violated.\nI ABSOLUTELY encourage aggressive gameplay. When someone is raging at being ganked my team gets instructed to GANK HIM HARD to try to get him to quit. Friendly discussion between opponents is also a welcome addition to any game I play.
