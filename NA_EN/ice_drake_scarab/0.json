Is there anyway to verify that these are both my accounts? I really don't want to miss another sale. I have 490 RP on my account, (Summoner Name: Ice Drake Scarab) and I would like to purchase a gift of High Noon Yasuo for MY other account (Summoner Name: SaltyFetusFlesh), which is currently on sale for 487RP, as opposed to the usual price of 975RP, thank you and please get back to me! c:","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-23T01:32:25.345+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The gifting system is set up this way to prevent hackers from being able to gift away all of someones RP immediately upon gaining access to their account. Because of that, I won't be able to make any kind of exception. \n\nHowever! Since you've contacted us already and let us know that you're trying to catch this sale, if the sale ends before you're able to send that gift then simply write us a ticket and we should be able to adjust the price for you.","replies":[{"poster":"Ice Drake Scarab","date":"2017-07-23T01:40:14.843+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks a lot for responding so fast! I figured this would be the answer, and I completely understand the answer and reason the gifting system is how it is, my friend got his account stolen and banned by someone he trusted, so any and all precautions to avoid situations like that should be taken, I feel good about the steps that are being taken towards two-step authentication and things like it. Thank you again! c:","replies":[]}]}]}
