This has been a problem for a while, and I have posted a thread similar to this a while ago, yet I have been ignored. This, I believe, should be a simple fix and I was hoping if you can hot fix it. Gladiator Draven is one of my favorite skins, but I cannot play it because the lack of sound throws my farming skills off. I am sorry I cannot provide a video, as my computer is too slow to record screen and audio. Please fix!!!","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-02-17T23:14:46.700+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Draven Always, \n\nThanks for the report!
