{"poster":"DGWolffumbra","date":"2015-05-14T03:40:10.128+0000","title":"Why Karma's Proposed Changes Suck, from a 1k+ Ranked Game Karma Main","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":142,"down_votes":27,"body":"> _Updated for 5-15 PBE (see bottom)_\n\nSo, before I start with this, I&#039;ll introduce myself.  I am DGWolffumbra, originally named Wilbow, and I am a S4 Gold player that has probably by this point put in thousands of Karma ranked games because I&#039;ve played almost nothing but her post-rework (and a fair amount pre-rework).  I&#039;ve played her in basically every role not called ADC, so you could say that I am at least somewhat familiar with her current playstyle.\n\n\n\n> 1) Gathering Fire: \n> - CD Refund on spell hit increased to 2/2.5/3/3.5 at levels 1/6/11/16 from 2 at all levels \n> - CD Refund on Basic Attack still at 50% of spell hit value\n\nThe only issue is that power doesn&#039;t come for free.  Her passive is already incredibly good late game since it basically scales exponentially with % CDR (and ranks in Mantra lower its CD significantly), and it is mediocre early-game.  Mantra has around a 20 second CD late-game with many common builds, and her spells proc it constantly.  There is no way this could be balanced without really nerfing the empowered effects, which essentially makes her less fun to play and removes meaningful choice from her toolkit, lowering her skill ceiling.\n\n\n\n> Focused Resolve (W)\n>     - Can now target monsters in addition to champions\n\nThis is amazing; I love this, and it&#039;s long been needed to make Karma jungle viable.  Just wanted to point out that the changes aren&#039;t ALL bad.\n\n\n\n> Renewal (Mantra + W)\n>     - Reworked - both healing and bonus damage removed.\n>     - Now debuffs target for duration of tether + root.\n>         All damage dealt to target is increased by 10% (excludes true damage\n>         All damage dealt to target heals Karma for 20% of the damage dealt\n>         If the damage source is a champion on Karma&#039;s team (excluding Karma) they are also healed for 20% of damage dealt\n\nWhy does it suck?  Well, let&#039;s look at Karma&#039;s design.  She can damage with W and Q only (or R+E if these changes don&#039;t go through), meaning if you R+W, you're only getting 20% healing from a single Q.  Which means you are reliant on other champions for R+W to function post-changes as it does now.  From purely Karma&#039;s perspective, it&#039;s a **heavy QoL nerf** and **kills her solo potential**.  \n\nIt&#039;s also a massive nerf to Karma support early game because her current iteration of R+W is basically what allows me to handle all-in champs (*HINT* Those supports that are oppressing bot lane in the current meta *HINT*).  I typically use R+W when I, as Karma alone, want to NOT DIE or bait an enemy into being too aggressive and letting my ADC get a kill while getting away with a sliver of health.  It&#039;s useful all game long and encourages Karma to build a little bulkier, which is always good because KARMA&#039;S TOO FRAIL WITHOUT R+W AND ITEMS.\n\n\n\n> Defiance (Mantra + E)\n>     - No longer deals damage\n>     - Now increases target&#039;s shield by 30/90/150/210 (+.3 AP)\n>     - Aoe Shield amount is now 50% of primary target&#039;s shield amount from 30/70/110/150\n\nThis bothers me because her shield explosion on mantra has **always** been her defining feature as a champ and differentiates her from all of the other champions that use shields.  Stop trying to shoehorn support APCs as pure supports, please?  Wasn't shoehorning Zyra bot enough for you people?  _KARMA IS NOT JANNA.  STOP TRYING TO MAKE THEM MORE SIMILAR._  Karma being viable, but not OP, in multiple roles is an awesome thing.  Why are you trying to ruin that?  I don&#039;t...I don&#039;t understand.  \n\n\n\n> Do you know what changes would make me happy as a Karma support main?\n\n1. Lowering the cost of Q slightly (not E) like making it 50 mana at all ranks.  I&#039;m a poke support that&#039;s really limited on poke early game.  Maxing Q first, even as support, feels necessary to be relevant, but 50-70 mana every few seconds for not that much damage unmantra&#039;d hurts (especially post-MP5 nerfs).\n\n2. W now affects monsters in addition to champions.  Also, the cast range of W has been reduced by 50 but the tether range is increased by 50.  Obvious reasons for both of these changes for anybody who has ever played Karma.\n\n3. R+E AoE shield is now 60% of the primary target&#039;s shield amount.  Everything else unchanged.  This essentially keeps the numbers for the ability just about where they&#039;re at now while being infinitely more intuitive to players.\n\n...And that's it.\n\n\n\n> **UPDATE: A new iteration of changes is headed to PBE.  This will replace the old changes talked about above.**\n> \n[](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-DGOC6oMfPz8/VVVcCwWHAAI/AAAAAAAAqKg/YXILBIh496Q/s1600/CFA3JwGVEAAgLKJ.png)\n\nIn short, the big changes versus the old iteration are:\n1. R+W heal is back\n2. R+W damage is still gone, but the damage amp is replaced with a longer root when mantra'd (+.75/1/1.25/1.5 seconds)\n3. W no longer affects monsters\n4. Gathering Fire is now 2/2.5/3 seconds at level 1/7/13\n\n I'd argue that this iteration is better than the last.\n\nR+E iconic shield explosion is still gone, which saddens me. Not that it isn't being well compensated, but still. R+E feels a bit hollow without the damage.\n\nR+W is a weird, but not necessarily a bad, change. I mean, it's a dueling mantra (1v1 focused), but Karma wouldn't really benefit from the extra root dueling-wise unless you had high % CDR and cast Q a second before the root solidifed. However, such situations mean you have to deal with the slightly awkward pause during Q cast, which makes doing that not always ideal. It's more of a huge boon during teamfights, because basically you're rooting a guy for enough time for your team to wipe him out of existence, but that clashes with the whole 1v1 focus of the mantra.\n\nKeeping the heal is honestly the biggest deal here and is much appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Barbeeque FRFREE","date":"2015-05-14T04:28:32.831+0000","up_votes":51,"down_votes":7,"body":"I hate how Riot wants every champion to play in 1 specific way only, most likely to make balancing easier for them.

I'm not sure how you can trade with that - you'd have to be massively far ahead to trade evenly against that. I guess the trade off is that she won't get her Mantra Q off in that scenario, which is... something.\n\nWhat I do like is that it's a niche for her.

The Deletion&Remplacement killed bombshielding anyways (and Scarma isnt the true Karma anyways).

Also, pre-Deletion&Remplacement, Karma had the game's best shield together with Janna (but Karma actually needed to build AP, and was better in Midlane anyways).\n\nOn the other hand, the W nerf is so bad for Mid Karma. Its mainly there because the missing hp% healing could be pretty strong in the jungle coupled with Blur buff and the new shield. But it brings back Old Q's mantra effect, or at least ''feel'' to it. Of course, it could be cool if they added a ''more missing hp, more healing'' part.\n\nWhile Scarma will never get close to the magnificence and elegance of True Karma, this is a good change except for Midlane Scarma. Maybe make it damage dependant against monsters and missing hp% against champions, to keep the good of both versions without the bad things? Or make it more powerful when no allied champion is nearby?

If they make a change to a thing, there might be consequences that weren't expected and they have to develop it further.

I mean, not as much shielding, but lower mana cost + CD is om nom nom.\n\nR+E iconic shield explosion is still gone, which saddens me.  Not that it isn't being well compensated, but still.  R+E feels a bit hollow without the damage.\n\nR+W is a weird, but not necessarily a bad, change.  I mean, it's a dueling mantra (1v1 focused), but Karma wouldn't really benefit from the extra root dueling-wise unless you had high % CDR and cast Q a second before the root solidifed.  However, such situations mean you have to deal with the slightly awkward pause during Q cast, which makes doing that not always ideal.  It's more of a huge boon during teamfights, because basically you're rooting a guy for enough time for your team to wipe him out of existence, but that clashes with the whole 1v1 focus of the mantra.\n\nKeeping the heal is honestly the biggest deal here and is much appreciated.\n\nBut still, this is markedly better than the previous iteration.  My biggest concern at this point is that Karma already has limited ways of dealing damage, and these changes STILL remove 2 of them.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ionian StarChild","date":"2015-05-15T06:38:53.553+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"After trying her out on PBE, here are my thoughts regarding the proposed changes.\n\nPassive: I like that she can use more than one (if not two!) mantra-ed abilities in teamfights now. Her abilities' separate cooldowns keep this change from being overpowered. I would say this is up in the air whether or not Karma really needs it or not.\n\nEmpowered (Mantra-ed) W: I was a little excited when I heard the proposed changes. After trying it out on PBE, I have to say I'm a little disappointed in the fact that it is now really team oriented regarding its use. It loss a lot of its power due to the removal of the bonus damage and the heal is negligent to Karma alone unless her teammates co-ordinate with her. At one time I tried to get health back by using it on Corki only to die due to how weak the health I get back from it. I feel like the only ever reason I'll use the mantra-ed version of it is if my teammates are there. I'll only use it for the heal since the damage is not too noticeable either (even with the debuff). This is a disappointment for me. Ricklessabandon will have to look into the proposed changes again and come up with something. Otherwise, I'd like to have the original version of it back.\n\nNormal and Mantra-ed E: Again, I was really optimistic and tried to keep an open mind regarding the changes (after all we are testing it now and they are tentative). I actually miss the damage aspect of the shield and have found myself trying to ult + E at times to finish off an enemy only to felt cheated due to it not being there anymore. The extra shield is all right, but I'd rather the mantra-ed version deal damage again because Karma is really lacking now in terms of ways to deal damage in teamfights. The old version made this spell almost always a must-use for me in teamfights due to how much you can get out of it; a haste for any ally that's trying to kite an enemy, shields for all of them, as well as damage for assists in teamfights. I think Ricklessabandon will have to reconsider the changes for this ability because it doesn't seem satisfying at the moment.\n\nWith how she is currently, she's already given situations where you get to choose which ability to empower. For me, you would mantra Q for kiting/poking/chasing, w for baiting/dueling, and e for teamfights. With the proposed changes I feel like I'm almost always leaning towards using mantra-ed Q everytime now. W and E leaves a lot to be desired for me and I'm not satisfied with what either brings when I decide to empower them  (speaking only on Karma's position as a standalone champion, not as an ally/teammate).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Anonagon","date":"2015-05-15T03:32:29.720+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"agreed on all points.

Welcome to being a utility midlaner. But her effectiveness in ganks (which she already sets up INCREDIBLY effectively in lane) is no longer completely reliant on snare into Mantra Q, her E got a CD reduction and has more utility for her team, and her mantra will be available more often without CDR (well, more often with it too but she's not quite as reliant with the scaling reductions).\n\nImplying that this somehow lowers Karma's skill floor is insane to me because it puts each of her abilities into a clear, defined role (instead of them being kind of... whatever). Her E is clearly team utility, Q is damage, and W is for catching targets out. Karma has not gotten worse at any of these things, in fact, she has gotten better at all of them.\n\nYes, I think the RW change is going to hurt her ability to duel people. It doesn't hurt her ability to clear creep waves very easily with mantra Q early in the game, it doesn't hurt her poke, and it doesn't really change her play pattern. It does make her a more effective roamer by providing more utility, and it gives you reasons to use Mantra W that aren't \"I want to bait this guy under my tower by recovering health\". Implying that giving Karma MORE Mantra charges and more specialized reasons to use each Mantra will lower her skillfloor baffles me, especially if you have 1k+ ranked games as Karma. As someone who's been playing her since her release, I have never had a problem playing her midlane and will probably still continue to win mid lanes.\n\nLooking at mid lane Karma though, I rarely win the lane because of a clutch Mantra W. More often it's because I keep track of wards and call for good ganks when spells are down, because Karma is still going to be very good at setting up ganks for jungler (even better, now).\n\nBasically, let's let the changes come in and see if we ACTUALLY hate them before we start listing them all like nerfs. I feel like there's a lot of potential for this to give Karma solo lane a better recovery pattern (by providing more utility for her team that doesn't scale off of AP or levels) and improve Karma's power when ahead as well (by providing more utility on top of her pretty absurd damage potential with Mantra Q in teamfights).","replies":[{"poster":"Sirion","date":"2015-05-15T01:04:41.846+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"HERE HERE!!!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nebuul","date":"2015-05-15T00:42:06.330+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you coordinate with your adc, karma support is incredibly buffed.
