That is all I need to say is hypocrisy. I should come into a game and play whatever champ I feel is right for me for my role. So I chose Shaco and my entire team started to complain - I chose him anyway because he is my jungler and I will not play someone I am not comfortable with. Anyway so the game was won everything was fine until this started to happen, where I&#039;ll have players be like &quot; Yo report this ***** &quot;       &quot; yeah man shaco sucks **** report him for not communicating &quot;     then after the game my screen turns pitch black with a message saying &quot; You&#039;ve been reported &quot; HOW DOES THIS MAKE SENSE? How is it im being punished yet I didnt do anything, I muted them, yet they can get away with verbal abuse and I pay the price??? I love league, it is a fun game, but this community man. We get punished for things that is unfair.","replies":[{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2016-08-28T09:59:19.323+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"if all you are seeing is a \"you have been reported\" notification, that is part of the older reporting system, where when you get reported more frequently than regualr, you'll get that notice.\n\nIt doesn't actually mean anything other than what it really says.","replies":[]},{"poster":"EvilDustMan","date":"2016-08-28T09:41:30.789+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Reporting does not mean punishment.
