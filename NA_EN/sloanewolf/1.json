So, I am looking to buy a new mouse (hoping for an upper-limit of 70$) that works well and doesn&#039;t break fast. I don&#039;t need many side buttons as I only used 3-4 for league (wards and some item actives). My old mouse was a Razer Naga 2014 which lasted about 3 years ;(\r\n\r\n(I wasn&#039;t sure which board would be best for this, but I figured it does  invlolve league in a _general_ way.)","replies":[]}
